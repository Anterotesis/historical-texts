            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THE divided State of the Preſbyterian Churches, in this Part of the World, where divine Providence has caſt our Lot, has opened a melancholy Proſpect to my View for ſome conſiderable Space of Time! Which I did not think proper to communicate to others for a Seaſon; not knowing what were the Sentiments of my <hi>Brethren</hi> upon either Side of the Queſtion, becauſe I thought, however expedient, honourable and advantageous to the Redeemer's Kingdom, a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union</hi> might be, yet it was not practicable, unleſs the <hi>Body</hi> of both SYNODS was inclin'd thereto.</p>
            <p>BUT hearing of a Number of both SYNODS more deſirous of Peace and Union of late, and being excited by ſome Reverend Members of the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>New-York,</hi> and one of the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> to move in this Affair: I did at the laſt Seſſion of the Synod of <hi>New-York,</hi> in purſuance of my own Judgement and Inclination, and in compliance with the aforeſaid Excitements, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with ſome of my <hi>Brethren,</hi> make a <hi>Motion</hi> to the <hi>Synod,</hi> for <hi>Propoſals</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Union,</hi> which after ſome Reaſoning upon the Head, was comply'd with, and Meſſengers appointed to make <hi>Overtures</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Union</hi> of both Synods into one, which was done accordingly, and are now under Conſideration.</p>
            <p>AND being inform'd, that the Propoſals of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Union,</hi> occaſioned ſome Uneaſineſs in ſeveral Societies, I thought it my Duty, to endeavour to remove the Grounds thereof, and promote the glorious and truly evangelical Deſign of <hi>Peace,</hi> as well as I
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:006423_0003_1028DE488D449B40"/>
could, by committing my Thoughts on that Subject to Writing, and expoſing them to publick View!</p>
            <p>MY Motives to endeavour in earneſt to promote Peace and Union are theſe,</p>
            <p>NOT a Change of <hi>Sentiment,</hi> about the late Revival of Religion, No! I do now declare ſolemnly before the World, that I have ſeen no Cauſe to alter my <hi>Opinion</hi> in Relation to it, and therefore I do now <hi>believe</hi> its Reality, as much as formerly; and if after this open and expreſs Declaration, any will unjuſtly Cenſure me with the Contrary, perhaps becauſe I cannot be ſo narrow as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, I ſhall take no farther Notice of it, than to pity their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Prejudice, and appeal from their unrighteous Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to a higher and more impartial Tribunal; to a God that knows all the Thoughts and Deſigns of Men!</p>
            <p>I cannot come into a <hi>Union</hi> with any <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> whereto Acknowledgements contradictory to what I have now declared, are required, as <hi>Terms</hi> of <hi>Communion:</hi> No! I would rather chuſe a <hi>Priſon,</hi> or any kind of <hi>Sufferings:</hi> Nor is what I have ſaid in the following <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> concerning the <hi>Matters of doubtful Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> in the leaſt Degree inconſiſtent herewith; becauſe thoſe Expreſſions do not reſpect the <hi>Nature, Neceſſity,</hi> or <hi>Value</hi> of a Work of <hi>Converſion</hi> in general, or its Reality and Certainty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in itſelf; but only the Uncertainty of the <hi>Appearances</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Work</hi> in others, to us; or the Uncertainty of our <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> concerning them.</p>
            <p>NOW between thoſe two Things, the <hi>Difference</hi> is as wide as between <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> between divine <hi>Revelation</hi> and human <hi>Conjecture;</hi> if there be any who cannot perceive the <hi>Difference,</hi> they are to be pitied as Objects of Compaſſion, as <hi>Non Compos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>!</hi> And if they do perceive it, and will not acknowledge it, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover by their Want of <hi>Candour,</hi> a bad <hi>Cauſe,</hi> which needs ſuch inſincere ſophiſtical <hi>Arts</hi> to ſupport it; and deſerve <hi>Reproof:</hi> Such I would accoſt in the Language of <hi>Job</hi> to <hi>Zophar, Will you ſpeak wickedly for GOD, and talk deceitfully for him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TO cry up the <hi>Certainty</hi> of our <hi>Opinion,</hi> about any Inſtances of <hi>Converſion,</hi> in others in our Day, ſo as to make it a <hi>Badge</hi> of <hi>Diſtinction,</hi> between, or Engine of <hi>Diviſion</hi> among the <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of Chriſtianity, is (in its direct Tendency) to abuſe GOD'S <hi>Work</hi> to the Diſhonour of his Name, and the <hi>Injury</hi> of his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of exalting GOD it is to exalt our ſelves and our Opinion, (tho' probably the Honour of GOD is ſeriouſly intended,) which is always (reſpecting ſuch <hi>ſecret Matters) precarious</hi> and often <hi>partial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THO' I value the late <hi>Work</hi> of GOD highly, yet in the mean Time, I think it is ſinful to make my Opinion of it. a <hi>Term</hi> of <hi>Communion</hi> to others; for tho' I am as fully perſuaded as ever of its Reality, yet in the mean Time, I believe that my Opinion, and the Opinion of all others about ſuch Matters, is fallible and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain: Nor can I ſee in the ſacred Scriptures, any Warrant for impoſing my <hi>Opinion,</hi> or the Opinion of others, reſpecting the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible

Grace</hi> of GOD in particular Perſons, as a <hi>Term</hi> of <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> either Miniſterial or Chriſtian</p>
            <p>NOR have I been Moved to this Important <hi>Enterprize,</hi> by any Thing that concerns myſelf, either by <hi>Grief</hi> for any ſuppos'd <hi>Miſconduct</hi> of Mine, in Time paſt, or any <hi>Expectation</hi> of <hi>Credit, Comfort</hi> or <hi>Benefit,</hi> that may reſult from ſuch a <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Union</hi> in Time to come, ſo far as they Reſpect me!</p>
            <p>BUT <hi>MEERLY</hi> by the Conſideration, of the poſitive Command of GOD, to <hi>pray for the Peace of Jeruſalem,</hi> to <hi>purſue Peace,</hi> and <hi>to keep the Unity of the Spirit, in the Bond of Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TOGETHER with a Proſpect of the <hi>Honour</hi> that I conceive will redound to GOD'S <hi>Name</hi> as well as Manifold <hi>Benefits, Credit,</hi> and <hi>Comfort</hi> to the Societies of our Denomination, for a long Time to come, in Caſe ſuch a Re-union be obtained, upon a Scriptural Foundation: Generations yet unborn, are like to reap valuable Advantages by it, and praiſe GOD, for it with joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Lips! I have been likewiſe encourag'd in this, by conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing calmly, and as impartially as I could, the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy,</hi> that has ſubſiſted among us, which appears to me, to be only about <hi>Circumſtantials!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>PERMIT me, my <hi>Reverend Fathers</hi> and <hi>Brethren,</hi> in all <hi>humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> and with due <hi>deference</hi> to the <hi>Judgment</hi> of others, to expreſs my <hi>Sentiments,</hi> upon this <hi>Head,</hi> with a peaceful Intention.</p>
            <p>It ſeems to me, that thro' the <hi>heat</hi> of <hi>Debate,</hi> the principal <hi>Matters</hi> Controverted, were either not ſo very clearly and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly <hi>apprehended,</hi> or not ſo ſufficiently and happily <hi>attended to,</hi> by the <hi>Parties</hi> in Controverſey, as could be <hi>wiſhed!</hi>
            </p>

            <p>THIS Diverſity perhaps is owing to their different natural Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, different Capacities, different Methods of Education, different Opportunities of Converſation, different advances in divine Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Grace; and it may be in ſome Inſtances owing to the inſenſible corrupt <hi>Byaſs</hi> of Prejudice.</p>

            <p>PEACE doubtleſs includes the Union of her Inhabitants, their Protection from Dangers and Enemies, their univerſal Wellfare, and Enjoyment of all the Good they need. We ſhould earneſtly pray <hi>for the Peace of Jeruſalem,</hi> and that therein we may have Peace. Peace is the Gift of God, and for it he will be enquired of. Such as can do nothing elſe for the Peace of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> can pray for it, which is ſomething more than ſhewing their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, for it's the appointed way of obtaining Mercy: The Peace and Wellfare of the Goſpel Church in our Land, is to be ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſired and pray'd for by every one of us.</p>
            <p>NOW the <hi>Manner</hi> of <hi>praying</hi> for <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> is preſcrib'd thus, <hi>Peace be within thy Walls, i. e.</hi> to all the Inhabitants within thy Walls, high and low, rich and poor, bond and free: <hi>Peace</hi> be in all thy Dwellings, <hi>Peace</hi> be in all thy Fortifications and Armies, let them never be attack'd, or if they are, let them never be taken; ſo <hi>Muſculus, Pagnine, Hieron.</hi>

            <p>NOW we are encouraged to pray in the Manner aforeſaid, <hi>for the Peace of</hi> Jeruſalem, by a promiſe of Proſperity, <hi>they ſhall Proſper that love thee:</hi> Thoſe that ſincerely love, and heartily pray and ſtrive for the Peace and Weal of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſhall <hi>proſper;</hi> that God whom they hereby glorify, will bleſs them, and make at leaſt their Souls proſper; however Men may cenſure them.

This may bring to our wellcome Remembrance, that famous Scripture, (Iſa. xlv. 11.) <hi>Concerning the Work of my Hands command ye me.</hi> Herein the Almighty, by a Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcention truly aſtoniſhing and inexpreſſible, puts equal Honour upon, and gives equal encouragement to believing Prayer! <hi>Pray for the Peace of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>they ſhall Proſper that love thee.</hi>

            <p>BUT JERUSALEM had not only excellent ORDER, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a firm UNION among its Inhabitants, both which ſtand and fall together. And thus the viſible Church is under Regulations of a divine Original, <hi>for God is a God of Order, he is not the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Confuſion, but of Peace, in all the Churches of the Saints,</hi> (1 Cor. xiv. 33.) The Word <hi>Confuſion, (acataſtaſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But God is not the Author of <hi>Confuſion,</hi> but of <hi>Peace,</hi> and therefore of <hi>Order,</hi> which is the Contrary of <hi>Confuſion,</hi> and the cauſe and antecedent of Peace; to this purpoſe ſpeak many learned Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <note n="*" place="bottom">Arius Montanus, <hi>the vulgar</hi> Latin, Tremelius ex ſyr, <hi>and</hi> Bezas, <hi>verſions,</hi> Cajetan, Piſcator, Eraſmus, Paſor, Vatabulus, Symachus.</note> God himſelf is Order and Harmony, both in his Nature and in his Laws, which are but a Repreſentation of his Nature, ſo far as it is imitable by intelligent Beings. Now vital and practical Religion is but a Conformity to both, the Copy and Original or Prototype, and therefore it is of Neceſſity in its Nature and Genius, the very reverſe or contrary to <hi>diſcord, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion</hi> and <hi>diviſion.</hi>

            <p>PRAY obſerve, my Brethren, that the great God poſitively Commands us to <hi>keep the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace,</hi> (Epheſ. iv, 3) Every Word of this bleſſed Precept is big with <hi>Emphaſis, (Spudazontes terein, ten enoteta tou pneumatos, en to ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſmo tes eirenes)</hi> The Word tranſlated <hi>keep, (ſpudazontes)</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies our earneſt endeavour to preſerve a Thing with great ſtudy, ſolicitude and labour. This Precept is truly Evangelical; the Law requires abſolute Perfection upon pain of Death, but CHRIST urges our intenſe and diligent Endeavour after O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</p>
            <p>BUT what is it that we ſhould keep with ſo great Care and Pains? Why the UNITY <hi>of the Spirit, (ten enoteta tou pneumatos) the Oneneſs of the Spirit;</hi> it is that <hi>Oneneſs</hi> which he had ſpoken of in the ſecond and third Chapters of this Book, <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>Body of Chriſt,</hi> compos'd of different ſorts of People, united to one Head, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> at leaſt in Appearance and Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>THE Apoſtle calls the UNITY of the <hi>viſible Church,</hi> the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> not only becauſe there is a real ſpiritual and ſaving Union, between ſome of the viſible Church to CHRIST form'd by the Holy Spirit, from which the reſt are (Synecdochically) denominated; but alſo becauſe the external Union of the whole Church, is not Bodily, but Spiritual, namely of <hi>Minds</hi> agreeing among themſelves.</p>
            <p>MOREOVER as the <hi>viſible Church</hi> is not the natural Body of CHRIST, and yet has a religious Relation to him, it may therefore be call'd his ſpiritual or myſtical Body viſible, or in Profeſſion at leaſt; therefore the Union muſt be ſpiritual alſo, of the ſame Kind with the Body to which it belongs.</p>
            <p>BESIDES God, who is a <hi>Spirit,</hi> is the <hi>Author</hi> of this external Union of profeſſing Chriſtians into Church Fellowſhip, or of their being outwardly in Covenant with him, which has a <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> and <hi>noble tendency</hi> to engage them to be the Lords; to affect their Spirits and turn them from Sin to God; in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect this external religious Relation to the Father of Spirits, may be truly called the <hi>Unity of the Spirit:</hi> So that here a two-fold Unity of the Spirit is enjoyn'd, <hi>viz. internal,</hi> of the Mind, in Sentiment and of the Will in Affection; and <hi>external</hi> in a joint partaking of outward, but ſpiritual, Ordinances of Worſhip.</p>
            <p>The Word <hi>Bond (ſundeſmos)</hi> ſignifies, that which connects one Thing with another, or that which joins one Thing to another.</p>
            <p>NOW the <hi>Bond</hi> here enjoined is <hi>Peace. (eirene para to eis en eiren, a conectendo in unum,</hi> ſays <hi>Paſor)</hi> The etymology of the Word <hi>Peace</hi> ſignifies to connect or join different Things into one; and this truly is the tendency of <hi>Peace;</hi> it removes Prejudices, aſſwages Reſentments, conciliates and unites Mens Minds, and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:006423_0019_1028DE8151F49A78"/>
thus it preſerves the Unity of the Church of God, which is broken by angry Contentions and Debates.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>PEACE</hi> cannot be kept without mutual <hi>forbearance</hi> in leſſer Things, which Mankind are apt to entertain very different Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of: But <hi>forbearance</hi> has no Place among the <hi>fierce</hi> and <hi>furious,</hi> but only among the <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>meek.

            </p>
            <p>NOW if the Command of GOD obliges us to prevent as much as in us lyes, in the Uſe of all lawful Means, a Breach of the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Union of the Church of GOD, then by a neceſſary Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, the ſame Command of GOD, obliges us to uſe all lawful Means to recover this Union, when it is broke: Theſe two Things have an inſeparable Connection, he therefore that denies one, denies both conſequentially, and ſo oppoſes the commanding Authority of Almighty GOD.</p>
            <p>THE Apoſtle urges the aforeſaid UNITY, enjoin'd in the Verſes immediately following, by theſe ARGUMENTS, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT there is but <hi>one Body</hi> myſtical, the viſible Church, the Type whereof was the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Tabernacle, and in the room there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of afterwards one <hi>Temple.</hi> We are <hi>one Body,</hi> ſays <hi>Tertullian,</hi> from a conſciencious Regard to the Unity of Religion and Diſcipline, and Hope of the Covenant. <note n="*" place="bottom">Corpus ſumus, de conſcientia religionis, et diſcipline unitate, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>AND <hi>one</hi> divine <hi>Spirit,</hi> which governs and quickens the Church, and unites it into one <hi>Body,</hi> which cannot diſagree with itſelf, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 4.) ſo <hi>Zanchy</hi> and <hi>Grotius:</hi> Or the Word <hi>Spirit,</hi> as <hi>Beza</hi> thinks, may be taken for the human <hi>Mind,</hi> thoſe that join in Church-fellowſhip, agree in Mind, and Spirit among themſelves, as if they were but one Spirit, which cannot diſagree with itſelf. What is more monſtrous than for a Man to riſe up againſt himſelf, as <hi>Tirinus</hi> and <hi>Zanchy</hi> obſerve.</p>
            <p>ONE <hi>Hope of your Calling,</hi> we expect one and the ſame eternal Salvation, the <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>Hope;</hi> the Apoſtle by a <hi>Metonimy</hi> calls <hi>Hope,</hi> becauſe of their Relation to each other; now ſeeing we all expect the ſame eternal Felicity, why ſhould we diſagree and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide in our way to it?

            <p>ONE <hi>GOD and Father of all,</hi> who is <hi>above all,</hi> in reſpect of abſolute and univerſal Empire, eſſential and tranſcendent Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and <hi>thro' all,</hi> who by his Providence permeats, upholds, and rules all, and more eſpecially the Members of his viſible Kingdom, <hi>and in you all,</hi> uniting you to himſelf at leaſt viſibly, as one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all by JESUS CHRIST; this laſt Clauſe reſpects GOD the Father perſonally, the other two Perſons being before-mentioned, thus <hi>Eraſmus, Hieronimus, Grotius, Pool,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>OBSERVE how the bleſſed Apoſtle labours this important and momentuous Point, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>external</hi> UNION of the <hi>Church viſible;</hi> he is not ſatisfied with mentioning the expreſs Command of God enjoining all to labour for it, by the higheſt Authority, No! but knowing the ſtrong natural Averſion of Mankind againſt it, he urges our Compliance, by a beautiful Train of pertinent and ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Reaſonings, ſumarily repreſented, with amiable Elegance, and Energy of Addreſs, to gain our naturally reluctant Conſent, to our Honour, our Duty, and our Intereſt!</p>
            <p>GOD knows there is great Need of the aforeſaid <hi>Precept,</hi> and all the poignant <hi>Arguments</hi> whereby it is enforc'd, and of our attending thereto with all our Powers; for the Breaches of <hi>Union</hi> among the viſible Members of CHRIST'S Body, are as common as they are diſhonourable and fatal!

            <p>SATAN has more Senſe than that comes to, he knows by long Experience, that the Way for him to command, is to divide, and therefore he encourages <hi>Diviſion,</hi> with all his Might, he ſecretly

blows up People's <hi>Pride, Prejudice</hi> and <hi>Reſentment,</hi> againſt each other, that ſo he may bring them to open Ruptures, as well as fix them in that unhappy State, if poſſible beyond a Retrieve: Then the Name of GOD is diſhonoured, his People rendered contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and Brethren by Profeſſion and Principle in Fundamentals, as ſinfully as miſerably engaged to vex and hurt one another inſtead of promoting their own, each others, and the publick good, and all this under religious Pretexts of <hi>Zeal</hi> for GOD, which makes ſuch Conduct ſit the eaſier on Men's Minds; O Sirs! Is not the Chriſtian Church divided enough already, without any new Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? Conſider how the <hi>Jews, Turks, Pagans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and <hi>Deiſts</hi> are ſtrengthened in their Prejudices againſt Chriſtianity altogether, by the ſcandalous Contentions and Diviſions of the Profeſſors of it! And yet more and more new Sects are ſtarting up now and then! thro' the Agency of Men of hot Tempers, and narrow Minds, Lord have Mercy upon us! What ſhall be the End of theſe Things? It is ſhocking to think of the Diviſions that are now in <hi>Scotland!</hi> O! the needleſs ſinful <hi>Schiſms</hi> of the viſible Church, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be bewailed if poſſible with Tears of Blood! It would look more like the Spirit of Chriſtianity, to endeavour by peaceable, calm and condeſcending Methods, to unite if poſſible, the main Bodies of the Proteſtants (who hold the ſame Foundation Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples) into one, than to tear afreſh the ſeamleſs Coat of CHRIST into more Pieces and Shreds.</p>
            <p>BUT on the contrary, <hi>how pleaſant is it for Brethren to dwell together in</hi> Unity? As the Pſalmiſt informs us, <hi>Pſ.</hi> cxxxiiii. 1.

            <p>
               <hi>BEHOLD how good, and how pleaſant it is for Brethren to dwell together in Unity. It is like the precious Ointment upon the Head, that ran down upon the Beard, even</hi> Aaron's <hi>Beard, that went down to the Shirts of his Garments, as the Dew of</hi> Hermon, <hi>and as the Dew that defended upon the Mountains of</hi> Zyon, <hi>for there the Lord commanded the Bleſſing even Life for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Concord and Unity of Brethren, who profeſs the ſame eſſential Principles, in mutual Love and Endearment, and in the ſocial united Obſervance of all the Ordinances of religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, is good, pleaſant and profitable.</p>
            <p>IT is <hi>good</hi> in itſelf, becauſe agreeable to the poſitive <hi>Command</hi> of GOD, and the Dictates of right <hi>Reaſon,</hi> yea it is very good, it is more excellent, amiable, noble, and ornamental, than we can conceive or expreſs, and indeed it is not only good in itſelf, but it is good to us. For,</p>
            <p>IT is <hi>pleaſant</hi> like the holy aromatick anointing <hi>Oyl,</hi> which was pour'd on <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Head, when he was conſecrated to his

high and honourable Office of <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> and that with ſuch a liberal Effuſion, that <hi>it ran down his Beard,</hi> and even to the <hi>Skirts of his Garment,</hi> filling the Houſe with a balſamick Odour, a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſive delightful Fragrancy; this coſtly precious Unguent and Perfume which rejoice the Heart, was not conceal'd in, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to a Box, but pour'd forth with a generous Profuſion, and rich Abundance. So nothing can be more agreeable to a truly pious Mind, than Union and Harmony, in Truth, in Purity, in Love! Moreover,</p>
            <p>IT is <hi>profitable,</hi> as the <hi>Dew</hi> to the <hi>Earth,</hi> it is as the <hi>Dew of</hi> Hermon, <hi>and the Dew that deſcended upon the Mountains of</hi> Zyon, <hi>i. e.</hi> profitable both to Civil and Religious Societies, as the <hi>Dew</hi> is from <hi>Heaven,</hi> ſo is religious Concord and Unity. As <hi>Dew</hi> is <hi>mild</hi> and gentle in its Deſcent, not like the <hi>Rain</hi> which is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times impetuous <hi>ſtormy</hi> and violent; ſo is Love, Concord and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty all Harmony, Gentleneſs and Sweetneſs; whereas Contention, and Diviſion are harſh, diſcordant, furious!</p>
            <p>MOREOVER, the <hi>Dew cools</hi> the ſultry <hi>Air,</hi> refreſhes the parch'd <hi>Glebe,</hi> and promotes its fruitfulneſs. So <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Unity</hi> cool our angry Reſentments, gently refreſh our labouring Boſoms, and open a field of Uſefulneſs before us.</p>
            <p>AS the <hi>Dew</hi> makes the face of Nature Smile, and put on a verdent Veſtment, ſo <hi>Concord</hi> and <hi>Unity</hi> difuſe a univerſal Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, evangelical Gaiety, and generous Beneficence; and under its Protection and Influence the ſmalleſt Things grow great and are eſtabliſhed; whereas by Diſcord and Diſunion, together with the fatal Fruits thereof, their Springs of Solace and Sweetneſs are deeply ting'd with <hi>Mara's</hi> Waters, their beauty ſtain'd, and their Strength broken.</p>
            <p>FARTHER, Concord, Brotherly Love and Unity, are profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe of the <hi>Bleſſing of God.</hi> Such as dwell together in <hi>Unity</hi> and live in <hi>Love, the Lord commands upon them the Bleſſing, even Life for evermore, i. e.</hi> the Almighty Wills that they be happy, who ſo live. Where there is true Concord, there is the Bleſſing of God, a happy affluence of all good, it ſhall be well with them here and forever hereafter; for God will give them all the Mercies they need in this Life, together with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of their Sins, and everlaſting Bleſſedneſs in a future World. There, there the Lord commands the <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> even Life forevermore, <hi>they that dwell in Love, dwell in God, and God in them, for God is Love.</hi> As the Perfection of <hi>Love</hi> is the Bleſſedneſs of Heaven, ſo the Truth and Exerciſe of <hi>Love,</hi> is the foretaſte and earneſt of that Bleſſedneſs upon the Earth: And as it is ſaid of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>HERE let it be obſerved, that the CHURCH of CHRIST is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their inviſible or viſible.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>inviſible Church</hi> conſiſts only of thoſe that are ſincerely pious, whether in Heaven or upon Earth, ſattered up and down in many Places, and Nations, and under a variety of Profeſſions; this is the Catholick or univerſal Church which we profeſs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, in that excellent <hi>Sumary</hi> of Chriſtian Principles, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles <hi>Creed,</hi> they are called the inviſible Church, becauſe we are not able certainly to determine who they are in particular, their Principles of Action not being open to human Obſervance.</p>
            <p>SUCH of this <hi>inviſible Church</hi> as are on <hi>Earth,</hi> conſidered com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexly, are called the <hi>Church militant,</hi> or Church-waring, becauſe in this Life they have many Miſeries to endure, and many Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to conflict with, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Devil,</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> and the <hi>Fleſh;</hi> which afford conſtant Cauſe for Watchfulneſs and Humility; and frequent Occaſions for Mourning and Combat; for in many Things we offend all; on this Account the bleſſed Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately bewails his indwelling Corruption, the bitter Root of all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Diſorders, <hi>O wretched Man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the Body of this Death?</hi> Now the bleſſed GOD has furniſhed his People for the <hi>Combat,</hi> with compleat Spiritual <hi>Armour,</hi> he provides a <hi>Helmet, Breaſt-plate, Sword, Shoe,</hi> and <hi>Shield;</hi> and urges them to put on this Armour, to ſtand to their <hi>Arms,</hi> to <hi>fight,</hi> to <hi>quit themſelves like Men, and be ſtrong.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SUCH of the <hi>inviſible Church</hi> as are in <hi>Heaven,</hi> are call'd the <hi>Church triumphant,</hi> becauſe having fought the good Fight of Faith, finiſh'd their Courſe and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            <p>BUT the <hi>viſible Church</hi> conſiſts of all thoſe that are <hi>baptiz'd,</hi> and profeſs <hi>Faith</hi> in the fundamental, or <hi>eſſential</hi> and neceſſary Truths of the Goſpel, which have moſt direct Influence upon the Heart and Life.</p>
            <p>THIS is a mixed Body of Good and Bad, which none can ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from each other in this Life, nor ſhould any attempt ſuch an impracticable Taſk. Our Lord, ſo far as I can yet learn, has not given Authority to any Miniſters, or Churches, to ſuſpend
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:006423_0025_1028DE966EEA9EC0"/>
from, or caſt out of their Communion, any who have a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Meaſure of divine Knowledge, profeſs Faith in the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of the Chriſtian Religion, Subjection to the Government of the Church of CHRIST, and live a regular Life. The follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Similitudes,</hi> to which CHRIST compares the <hi>viſible Church,</hi> ſufficiently confirm this.</p>
            <p>THE firſt <hi>Similitude</hi> that I would mention is related by the Evangeliſt, <hi>Matthew</hi> xiii. from the 24th, to the 30th Verſe, and runs thus, <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is likned unto a Man that ſowed good Seed in his Field, but while Men ſlept, his Enemy came and ſowed Tares among the Wheat, and went away, but when the Blade was ſprung up, and brought forth Fruit, then appeared the Tares alſo, ſo the Servants of the Houſholder came and ſaid unto him, Sir, didſt thou not ſow good Seed in thy Field, from whence then hath it Tares? He ſaid unto them, an Enemy hath done this, the Servants then ſaid unto him, wilt thou then that we go and gather them up, but he ſaid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>THE Explication our Saviour gives of the Parable now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned is this, <hi>He that ſoweth the good Seed, is the Son of Man, the Field is the World, the good Seed are the Children of the Kingdom, but the Tares are the Children of the wicked One; the Enemy that ſow'd them is the Devil, the Harveſt is the End of the World, and the Reapers are the Angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOTHING can be more plain and expreſs to the Point in Hand, than this <hi>Parable</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> together with his own Explication of it; if it be conſidered,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT by the Kingdom of Heaven, which is the Subject-Matter of this Diſcourſe, the viſible Church is to be underſtood, which is compared in the Verſes immediately following, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of its ſpeedy Growth and Progreſs, in the early Times of Chriſtianity, to a <hi>Grain</hi> of <hi>Muſtard-Seed,</hi> ſoon becoming a Tree, and to <hi>Leaven</hi> hid in three Meaſures of Meal, till the whole was leavened.</p>
            <p>IT is called a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> becauſe in it as in temporal Kingdoms, there is a <hi>King</hi> to rule over it, namely JESUS CHRIST, <hi>Perſons</hi> to be ruled over, <hi>Laws</hi> of Government, as well as a Neceſſity of <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> to them, and <hi>Subjection</hi> to the <hi>Prince</hi> of the Kings of the Earth, the <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is called the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> becauſe the Original of the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of the viſible Church, was from Heaven and the <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency</hi> thereof is Heavenly, and the final <hi>Iſſue</hi> to all that ſincerely and believingly obey the Laws of this Kingdom, is Heaven or Salvation: And hence the King of it is ſaid to be <hi>the Author of eternal Salvation to all that obey him.</hi> GOD the Father

(<hi>Iſa.</hi> lx. 14. <hi>Heb.</hi> xii. 22. <hi>Rev.</hi> xiv. 1.)

(2 <hi>Sam.</hi> vi. 17. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> xvi. 1.)

            </p>
            <p>THE viſible Church is juſtly called the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> in Scripture, tho' there are many Hypocrites in it; becauſe CHRIST governs it as a KING, and there is a remnant in it, that are willingly ſubject to his governing Authority, who is the Lord from Heaven, from whom as the better part it is deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated, this <hi>Church</hi> is the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> upon Earth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE <hi>Deſign</hi> of this <hi>Parable</hi> is twofold, 1ſt. To ſhew that the State of the viſible Church is a mix'd State in this World; it conſiſts, as our Lord informs us, of <hi>Wheat</hi> and <hi>Tares,</hi> the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Kingdom, and the Children of the wicked one, good and bad. And 2d. That the Servants of the Church, the <hi>Miniſters</hi> and other <hi>Church Officers,</hi> muſt not attempt to ſeparate the <hi>bad</hi> from the <hi>good,</hi> who are in the viſible Church, who have ſuch a reſemblance of Wheat, of Piety in their outward Appearance, that they cannot be rooted out, without the Hazard of a miſtake, and in conſequence of it, rooting up the Wheat with them, as Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> obſerves.</p>
            <p>The Caſe is here fairly ſtated, and an explicit Anſwer given thereto by our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The <hi>zealous Servants</hi> who were very deſirous and forward to have a <hi>perfect Church</hi> upon <hi>Earth,</hi> and to this purpoſe to have the Tares rooted out of it, enquire of their Maſter, what was his Will and Pleaſure in this Caſe? <hi>Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up;</hi> obſerve it was not the openly Prophane or avowed Hereticks, that divulge their Sentiments, for theſe may be known, and according to the

But it was the cloſe Hypocrites, who were Doctrinally ſound in main Points of Truth, and outwardly regular in Conduct, that the Servants wanted to be tampering with, and caſt out; and it ſeems they imagined that they were ſufficiently qualified for that awful Province of ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Hearts of others, and juding of their inviſible Grace! O lamentable Vanity! But <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not of their Opinion, their Maſter was not of their Mind, he ſtop'd their well meant but dangerous <hi>Career,</hi> by a plain, authoritative and well grounded NEGATIVE to their Queſtion, NAY, <hi>leaſt while ye gather up the Tares, ye root up alſo the Wheat with them, i. e.</hi> you are not qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for, you are not equal to that <hi>task</hi> you are ſo ready to engage in, and ſo fond to undertake, <hi>viz.</hi> of judging and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining about the States of Mens Souls, from their inward, ſpiritual and inviſible Experiences, and making your <hi>Sentiments</hi> about them <hi>Terms of Communion;</hi> and therefore <hi>let them grow to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether until the Harveſt,</hi> that is, to the End of the World, as our Lord himſelf explains it, <hi>i. e.</hi> let the good and bad continue in the Boſom and Fellowſhip of the viſible Church till the End of Time, the General Judgment, the Conſumation of all Things, and then the Angels ſhall make a full and final Separation between them in that Day, namely, of the general Judgment, when the Lord of Hoſts makes up his <hi>Jewels, then,</hi> and not before, <hi>ye ſhall certainly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern between the Righteous and the wicked, betw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

There is one Lawgiver, who is able to ſave and to deſtroy, who art thou that judgeſt another?</hi> (Jam. iv, 12.) Upon which the reverend and learned Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> gloſſeth thus, <q>One abſolute, ſupream, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal and ſpiritual Lawgiver, who can ſimply and directly bind Mens Conſciences, and make Laws for their Souls, (<hi>Pro.</hi> viii. 15, 16. <hi>Iſa.</hi> xxxiii, 22. <hi>Act.</hi> iv. 19.) By this he intimates, that they did invade God's Right, who took upon them a legiſlative power in preſcribing to other Mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and making their own Will the Rule of the others Duty. <hi>Who is able to ſave and deſtroy</hi> both temporally and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, (<hi>Deut.</hi> xxxii, 39. 1 Sam. ii. 6. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> xliii. 13.) whereas other Law-givers cannot ſave or deſtroy Mens Souls, nor ſo much as their Lives, without God's concurrence. <hi>Who art thou that judgeſt another,</hi> what a ſorry Creature, a Man, a Worm, that thou ſhouldſt lift up thy ſelf into God's Place,

and make thyſelf a Judge of one not ſubject to thee, the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of another Maſter. (<hi>Rom.</hi> xiv. 4.)

            <p>AND ſhall we, Sirs, under pious pretexts of purifying the Church, in our own way, openly <hi>rebel</hi> againſt the <hi>Authority</hi> of our King and Sovereign, prefer our <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> I might juſtly ſay <hi>folly,</hi> to his infinite <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> and reflect upon his <hi>Fidelity</hi> and <hi>Care</hi> for his <hi>Churches good,</hi> as if he had not given a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Syſtem</hi> of <hi>Laws</hi> for its good Government and Advantage, without our Additions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God forbid!</p>
            <p>SIRS, all Methods of purifying the Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of human Contrivance, notwithſtanding of their fair Face, and the good deſign of their zealous formers, are miſcheivous to it; they rob us of the Liberty <hi>wherewith Chriſt has made us free,</hi> puff up fooliſh Mortals with Pride of Attainments they have not; ſet them in chaſe of the Knowledge of other Peoples Hearts, which they cannot attain, to the neglect of their own, which they may in ſome Degree attain, and rend the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in <hi>pieces,</hi> by <hi>debates, envyings, wraths, ſtrifes, backbitings, wiſperings, ſwellings, tumults,</hi> (2 Cor. xii. 20.)

Now there is no Neceſſity to take the Words ſo, for there are other Ways of putting People out of the viſible Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out killing of them: And as ſuch a <hi>gloſs</hi> is uncharitable, ſo it is irrational and abſurd, becauſe it ſuppoſes a Diſpoſition in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of CHRIST to put Members of the viſible <hi>Church</hi> to Death meerly for their want of Grace unexpreſſed by Speech and Action; for the <hi>Parable</hi> treats of <hi>Tares</hi> that do ſo nearly reſemble the <hi>Wheat,</hi> that they cannot be certainly diſtinguiſhed from it by the moſt pious and intelligent: Now to kill People meerly for the want of ſaving Grace, unevidenced by any Inſtance of criminal Conduct prejudicial to Society, is ſuch a <hi>monſter</hi> of Barbarity and Nonſenſe, that the very worſt Perſecutors that have ever appeared upon the Stage of the World, ſince the Foundations of it were laid, have not (ſo far as I know) been guilty of it; and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>Chriſt's Religion,</hi> in general, to be more

               <hi>cruel</hi> and nonſenſical then all the reſt of Mankind, is no great Compliment either to it or them.</p>
            <p>BESIDHS ſuch a gloſs is contrary to the Words of the <hi>Parable;</hi> it is not living abſolutely in the World that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpeaks of, but living reſpectively in a State of external <hi>Union</hi> in the viſible Church, let them <hi>both grow together</hi> till the <hi>Harveſt:</hi> And it is contrary to the <hi>Deſign</hi> and <hi>Explication</hi> of the <hi>Parable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THH <hi>Deſign</hi> of the <hi>Parable</hi> is to ſhew that the viſible Church or Kingdom of CHRIST, which is joined together by an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Bond</hi> of <hi>Union,</hi> is compos'd of good and bad, and will remain mixed till the End of Time; and that we ought to let it remain ſo, ought to let them grow together, becauſe we are not capable to make a judicial actual <hi>Diſtinction</hi> between Saints and Hypocrites<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without doing Injury to the former. The Thing in view is the unlawfulneſs of breaking the <hi>Churches</hi> outward <hi>Union,</hi> becauſe of our Judgment about <hi>internals;</hi> which is contradicted by the aforeſaid <hi>gloſs;</hi> for tho' it acknowledges the ſinfulneſs of <hi>killing</hi> People meerly becauſe we judge they want inviſible Grace; yet it allows of a Breach of the Churches <hi>Union</hi> upon that ſlender Foundation, which oppoſes CHRIST'S Sentiment and the Reaſon of it, which is this, the Danger of doing wrong thro' our incapacity, which does not only conclude againſt the higheſt Degrees of wrong, but every Degree of it, and all Methods of Management tending thereto; becauſe all wrong is of the ſame general Kind, all unreaſonable and contrary to the Law of Nature. As <hi>Church fellowſhip</hi> is a valuable Priviledge, ſo of conſequence to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of it, without juſt Cauſe, is unjuſt, as really as to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly deprived of Life, tho' not in ſo great a Degree; and therefore all Attempts that are like to involve us in either of theſe Evils, ſhould be carefully avoided.</p>
            <p>NOR is the aforeſaid gloſs agreeable to our Lords <hi>Interpretation</hi> of the <hi>Parable,</hi> which informs us, <hi>that the Angels ſhall gather out of his Kingdom all Things that Offend, and them which do Iniquity, and ſhall caſt them into a Furnace of Fire, i. e.</hi> the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, as Inſtruments of divine Juſtice, ſhall ſeparate the wicked from the good, with whom in this Life ſome of them have aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated in Church Fellowſhip, and caſt them into a Place of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. But will they deſtroy the Life they have, or anihilate their Exiſtence? No. Our Saviour aſſures us, that <hi>there ſhall be weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and gnaſhing of Teeth,</hi> But to proceed; The</p>
            <p n="2">2d. SIMILITUDE which I would diſcourſe of, is that men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by <hi>John the Baptiſt, (Mat.</hi> iii. 12.) whereby the viſible <hi>Church</hi> of CHRIST is compared to a FLOOR, upon which is <hi>Chaff</hi> and <hi>Wheat, whoſe Fan is in his Hand, and he will thoroughly purge his Floor, and gather his Wheat into the Garner, but he will burn up the Chaff with unquenchable Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here obſerve the following Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1 THAT the <hi>viſible Church</hi> is Chriſt's <hi>Floor, (Iſa.</hi> xxi. 10.) the Temple, a Type of it was built upon a threſhing Floor.</p>

            <p n="3">3. THAT there is a <hi>Day</hi> coming, when there ſhall be a full and final <hi>Separation</hi> made between the <hi>Chaff</hi> and <hi>Wheat,</hi> viz. the Day of Judgment, then there will be a viſible Diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Good and Bad, in reſpect of their Doctrines, their Works, their Perſons, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> iii. 13—15. <hi>Matt.</hi> xxv. 32.) <hi>Before him ſhall be gathered all Nations, and he ſhall</hi> SEPARATE <hi>them one from another, as a Shepherd divideth his Sheep from the Goats.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. THAT the Lord JESUS CHRIST is only capable, to make a true a juſt and final <hi>Separation,</hi> or Diſtinction among Men uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally according to their <hi>States</hi> and <hi>Actions;</hi> being the Wiſdom of his Father, and all Eye, and that he alone has Authority to occupy this important Province, and execute this difficult Truſt; ſeeing all Judgment is committed to him, and to him only, by his Father; and hence we are told, that his FAN in his Hand, which is threefold, ſays <hi>Brugenſis,</hi> viz. a FAN of <hi>Doctrone,</hi> of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and of <hi>Judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A FAN of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> whereby ſome internal Diſtinction is made between good and bad, while the Nature and Characters of true Chriſtianity, are ſcripturally and cautiouſly open'd, while the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and Threatnings are diſtinctly and pertinently propos'd and pronounc'd.</p>
            <p>A FAN of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> or of Sufferings upon a religious Account, whereby ſometimes much <hi>Chaff</hi> is blown away from the <hi>Wheat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A FAN of <hi>Judgment,</hi> whereby CHRIST ſearches the <hi>Heart and Reins of all the Children of Men,</hi> and diſtinguiſhes the moſt ſubtle Hypocrite from the truly Pious, and will openly ſeparate them all from each other, in the great Day of his coming, in vertue of a ſupreme judicial Authority, aſſign'd him by his Father, as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his Abaſement; this is his peculiar <hi>Prerogative</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable <hi>Royalty,</hi> which it is great <hi>Sacriledge</hi> for any to aſſume. This FAN of Judgment, which is principally intended in the aforeſaid Words, for till the Time of the laſt Judgment the <hi>Floor</hi> of the viſible <hi>Church</hi> ſhall not be thoroughly <hi>purg'd,</hi> I ſay, this <hi>Fan</hi> of Judgment is in CHRIST'S Hand alone, excluſive of all Competitors to his <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>Dignity!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As this <hi>Similitude</hi> plainly repreſents the mixed State of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church of CHRIST, namely, that it conſiſts of real <hi>Saints</hi> and cloſe <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> ſo it ſhews with equal Evidence, that it is CHRIST alone that is qualified with competent Capacity, and veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with rightful Authority, to make a judicial univerſal <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> between them: And of Conſequence, that it is an unjuſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and criminal Invaſion of his royal <hi>Prerogative,</hi> for any of the Children of <hi>Adam</hi> to aſſume and attempt it, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be their civil or religious Character or their ſuperior En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments notwithſtanding.

            <p n="3">3d. SIMILITUDE, which is very remarkable and inſtructive, concerning the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>viſible Church</hi> of CHRIST

on Earth, we have in the 13th Chapter of <hi>Matthew,</hi> the 47th, 48th, and 49th Verſes, <hi>Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a Net, that was caſt into the Sea, and gathered of every Kind, which when it was full, they drew to Shore, and ſet down and gathered the good into Veſſels, and caſt the Bad away; ſo ſhall it be in the End of the World, the Angels ſhall come forth, and ſever the Wicked from among the Juſt, and ſhall caſt them into the Furnace of Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> or the <hi>Church viſible,</hi> (ſay <hi>Malvenda, Burgenſis, Grotius, Beza, Gegerus, Piſcator,</hi> and others) is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to a <hi>Net, (Sagine)</hi> a DRAG-NET, as <hi>Ulpian</hi> and <hi>Varro</hi> explain the Word, the Nature of which is to draw along with it what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it meets with, and this is indeed confirm'd by the following Words of the Parable, <hi>and gathered of every Kind,</hi> i. e. of <hi>Fiſhes,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Parable</hi> treats of fiſhing, yet no doubt other Things are apt to come into a <hi>Drag-net,</hi> it is apt to ſweep along with it, not a little Traſh and Rubbiſh.

            <p>HAVING endeavoured to repreſent the mixed State of the <hi>Church</hi> viſible, by conſidering three Scriptural <hi>Similitudes,</hi> that treat of it; I would now proceed to Diſcourſe a little upon the <hi>Terms</hi> of <hi>Admiſſion</hi> into it, and <hi>Excluſion</hi> from it</p>
            <p>BAPTISM is certainly the <hi>Door</hi> of Entrance into the viſible <hi>Church,</hi> or Kingdom of CHRIST, and hence thoſe that were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized were ſaid to be <hi>added to the Church,</hi> (Acts ii)</p>
            <p>NOW this initiatory Ordinance, is, according to the Judgment of the main Body of the Proteſtant Churches, (agreeable to the holy Scriptures) and particularly of our OWN, to be diſpens'd not upon the Foundation of <hi>Perſons</hi> having <hi>Grace,</hi> or upon the Church's <hi>Judgment,</hi> concerning their inward <hi>gracious Experiences,</hi> No! But upon the <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of their <hi>Faith,</hi> and outward Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Relation to GOD. The Words of our Confeſſion of Faith are theſe, <q>Not only thoſe that do actually profeſs Faith in, and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto CHRIST, but alſo the Infants of one or both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Parents, are to be baptiz'd, (See <hi>Mark</hi> xvi. 15.16. <hi>Acts</hi> viii. 37, 38. <hi>Acts</hi> ii. 41. <hi>Gen.</hi> xvii. 7, 9. <hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 9.14. <hi>Col.</hi> ii. 11, 12.)</q> and upon this Head it is farther added,</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>THAT by the right Uſe of this</hi> Ordinance, <hi>the Grace pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed is not only offered, but really exhibited, and</hi> conferred <hi>by the</hi> Holy Ghoſt <hi>to ſuch, (whether of Age or Infants) that Grace belongeth unto, according to the Council of GOD'S Will, in his appointed Time</hi> (Gal. <hi>iii. 27.</hi>) For as many of you as have been baptized unto CHRIST have put on CHRIST, <hi>Tit. iii. 5.</hi> He ſaved us by the Waſhing of Regeneration, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of the Holy Ghoſt. <hi>Epheſ. v. 25, 26.</hi> As CHRIST loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it, that he might ſanctify and cleanſe it with the waſhing of Water by the Word. <hi>Acts ii. 38.</hi> Then <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid unto them, repent and be baptized every one of you, and ye ſhall receive the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Con. chap. 28.

Much like this was the Perment and Prejudices that aroſe between the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> Chriſtians, and their uncharitable Conduct towards each other, which were ſtill of an earlier Date. <hi>Preſidents</hi> that demand our <hi>pity</hi> and <hi>caution,</hi> but deſerve not our <hi>Imitation!</hi> but of the latter I know no Example in Scripture or Hiſtory; and far leſs is there any Foundation in the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> or in our excellent <hi>Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> for ſuch unaccountable Proceedings!

            <p>YOU know, my Reverend and Beloved Fathers and Brethren, it is our bounden Duty to beware of all <hi>ſuperſtitious</hi> human <hi>Inventions,</hi> in <hi>Doctrine, Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> however piouſly they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd and zealouſly they are defended notwithſtanding.

            <p>OUR dear <hi>Redeemer</hi> is faithful in all his <hi>Houſe,</hi> as <hi>Moſes,</hi> for he is Wiſdom, Goodneſs and Love itſelf; he has never freed his Churches from the Ceremonial Inſtitutions of a divine <hi>Original,</hi> to <hi>gall</hi> the <hi>Necks</hi> of his Diſciples with a heavier <hi>Yoke</hi> of human Inventions, No. his <hi>Yoke</hi> is peculiarly eaſy, and his <hi>Burden</hi> light in the preſent Evangelick Day.</p>

               <hi>Peace</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> conſiſts in actual Reconciliation to him, thro' a ſincere and unreſerved Acceptance of the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the Peace-maker, in all his Offices and Relations, fully, freely and forever; as well as thro' an intire Dependance upon his Merit, as the only deſerving Cauſe of our Acceptance with God: Which is preceeded in the Adult, with a <hi>diſtreſſing Senſe</hi> of our awful na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural <hi>Enmity</hi> againſt God, our extream <hi>undoneſs</hi> thereby, and our utter Impotency, either to make Satisfaction to divine Juſtice for our Offences, or cure the moral Maladies of our Minds.</p>

            <p>THIS <hi>Peace,</hi> as well as that with ourſelves, and our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, proceeds from <hi>GOD</hi> the <hi>Father,</hi> as the Projector of it, in the Depths of his unſearchable <hi>Wiſdom;</hi> and hence the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſpeaks of him in this endearing ſtrain, <hi>Now the God of Peace that brought from the Dead our Lord</hi> Jeſus, <hi>that great Shepherd of the Sheep, thro' the Blood of the everlaſting Covenant.</hi>

            <p>THIS <hi>Peace</hi> proceeds alſo from <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> as the <hi>Purchaſer</hi> of it, by the invaluable Treaſures of his precious Blood; and hence in the Epiſtle of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Coloſians,</hi> he is ſaid to have <hi>made Peace thro' the Blood of his Croſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS <hi>Peace</hi> proceeds likewiſe from <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> as the <hi>applyer</hi> of it, by the efficacious influence of his <hi>Operations,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we would not accept the <hi>Mediator,</hi> nor could our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Enmity be broke.</p>
            <p>

            <p>
               <hi>PEACE</hi> with our Neighbour is threefold, viz. <hi>Oeconomical, Political, Eecleſiaſtical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>PEACE Oeconomical,</hi> or quiet in the <hi>Family,</hi> is a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Privilege, (Pſal. cvii. 41.) <hi>He ſetteth the Poor on high from Affliction, and maketh him Families like a Flock; the Righteous ſhall ſee it and rejoyce, and all Iniquity ſhall ſtop her Mouth.</hi> Among the ſurprizing Changes which a ſovereign <hi>Providence</hi> brings to paſs ſometimes among the Affairs of the Children of Men, this that the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> mentions in this Pſalm, is very remarkable. That while the Almighty abaſes the Great and Honourable, pours Contempt on <hi>Princes</hi> that abuſe their Authority, and ſlight his Mercy, while he dethrones them from their Grandeur and Dignity, reduces them to diſtreſſing ſtraits, and Cauſes them to wander in the Wilderneſs where there is no Way; baffles their Councils, and breaks their Pride and Pomp. He in the mean Time exalts the Humble, he ſetteth the Poor on high, he raiſes them from the Duſt of meaneſs and obſcurity, to Places of Truſt and Honour. And that which adds equal Security, Beauty and Eaſe to their <hi>Elevation,</hi> is the number and quietneſs of their Children and Families, <hi>he makes their Families like a Flock;</hi> a Flock of <hi>Sheep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </hi> numerous indeed; but meek, peaceful, uſeful, ſociable, in this reſembling the true and living Members of the Church of Chriſt, who are cloathed with this inſtructive amiable <hi>Character. (John</hi> x) When ones Family is quiet and calm, it is a noble <hi>Aſylum,</hi> a little Sanctuary to retreat to from Tempeſts abroad, a great Satisfaction and Support in Life, that ſooths all our Sorrows, ſweetens all our Labours and Anxieties, and lulls every Grief to reſt. But the Contrary is no little Addition to our other Calamities; it ſtorms us from our proper Place of Refuge and Retreat; puts Vinegar and Nitre into our Wounds, and adds double weight to all our Woes!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>PEACE Political,</hi> or quiet in the <hi>State,</hi> (of the right Kind) is a freedom from War, with National Enemies, upon a ſafe and honourable Foundation, and a <hi>Union</hi> and Harmony among our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, reſpecting Matters of a civil Nature.</p>
            <p>THEN we no more hear the confus'd noiſe of the <hi>Warrior,</hi> or ſee <hi>Garments roll'd in Blood,</hi> a rueful, pitious ſpectacle, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but excite, in generous Boſoms, the ſofteſt Sympathy's of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, the tendereſt Sentiments of Humanity!</p>
            <p>HOW amiable, deſirable and valuable a Benefit muſt <hi>political Peace</hi> (of the right Kind) be; it opens a pleaſing ſcene of <hi>Plenty</hi> before us, and frees us from innumerable <hi>Anxieties,</hi> (Pſal. clxvii. 14.) <hi>He maketh Peace in thy Borders and filleth thee with the fineſt of the Wheat.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>PEACE Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> or <hi>Peace</hi> in the Church, is oppoſed both to <hi>Schiſm</hi> from within, in its own Body, and <hi>Perſecution</hi> from without, from open Enemies.

            <p>IN general I may obſerve, that the <hi>Terms</hi> that ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, are ſuch as tend to preſerve and tranſmit, pure and uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>NOW the ſcriptural <hi>Terms</hi> of Eccleſiaſtical <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Union,</hi> are either <hi>Doctrinal</hi> or <hi>Practical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Doctrinal Term</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Union</hi> which our LORD has appointed, is a Confeſſion of <hi>eſſential</hi> and neceſſary <hi>Articles,</hi> in Doctrine, Worſhip and Diſcipline, contained in the holy Scriptures, agreeable to which are our excellent <hi>Weſtminſter Confeſſion of Faith, Catechiſms</hi> and <hi>Directory</hi> for Worſhip and Government.</p>
            <p>THESE <hi>Terms</hi> are truly Scriptural, inaſmuch as we are enjoin'd in the ſacred Oracles, by the ſame ſupream Authority, to <hi>reject Hereticks,</hi> or thoſe that obſtinately hold <hi>fundamental Errors, after the firſt and ſecond Admonition,</hi> and in the mean Time <hi>to receive the Weak,</hi> who hold circumſtantial Errors, being in other Things ſound. We are of Conſequence, plainly directed to make <hi>eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> and <hi>neceſſary Articles</hi> only, <hi>Terms</hi> of <hi>Communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed theſe <hi>terms</hi> are <hi>rational, Catholick,</hi> and <hi>peaceable,</hi> they may be defended by Argument, and no other that I know of, they are a noble <hi>Medium</hi> between two dangerous <hi>Extreams</hi> of unjuſtifyable <hi>ſeverity</hi> upon the one Hand, and Criminal <hi>laxneſs,</hi> on the other, the former of which encroaches upon our <hi>Liberty,</hi> and the latter is Prejudicial to <hi>Truth,</hi> both which ought to be ever Dear to us! If any other Method beſides what is before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned be taken, either fundamental Truths will be betray'd, or good Men rejected, whom we are commanded to receive, and who when receiv'd, are like to be of ſervice to CHRIST'S Kingdom.</p>
            <p>NOR ſhould it be lightly paſſed over, that we ſhou'd not receive the <hi>Weak, to doubtful diſputations, i. e.</hi> we ſhou'd not diſtreſs and enſnare them, with <hi>Debates</hi> about Things of ſmall Moment, which are comparatively doubtful and uncertain, not only obſcure in their own Nature, but ſuch as there is no abſolute promiſe of the Holy Unction to lead all good Men to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of; and ſeeing the Caſe is ſo it is no Argument either of good <hi>Judgment</hi> or great <hi>Humility,</hi> to be very peremptory and confident about ſuch Things, becauſe the <hi>confidence</hi> is diſpr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Superſtructure will ſtand the firmer, that the Foundation be well laid.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>abuſe</hi> of theſe <hi>Terms</hi> cannot take away the regular Uſe of them, no more than the abuſe of other good Things can reaſonably deprive us of the comfort of them.</p>
            <p>AND tho' the Number of <hi>eſſential</hi> and neceſſary <hi>Articles</hi> has not hitherto been determined, by any <hi>Church</hi> that I know of, yet every Perſon, and of Conſequence every <hi>Church,</hi> as ſuch, muſt certainly have a right to determine for themſelves, what they reckon to be ſuch. But to proceed,</p>
            <p>THE Practical <hi>Term</hi> of Peace and Union in Churches where there are complaints of <hi>Miſconduct,</hi> are either an Expreſs verbal acknowledgement of them in Things of a <hi>Moral</hi> nature, or a <hi>Reformation</hi> from them.</p>
            <p>NO doubt in <hi>Churches</hi> form'd and united, an explicit open ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal Acknowledgment, ſhould be required, eſpecially for groſs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of immoral Conduct, which the Light of Nature teaches the Sinfulneſs of.</p>
            <p>BUT when the <hi>Church</hi> is either in its <hi>Infancy</hi> not fully form'd, or in a <hi>broken</hi> and <hi>divided State,</hi> and when there is a <hi>Reformation</hi> from the Evils complain'd of, and urging a <hi>verbal Acknowledgement</hi> tends to open wider the bleeding Wounds of the Church, to tear her in pieces; and conſequently to deſtroy her; it ſhould not be inſiſted on even in reſpect of groſs <hi>Immorality;</hi> becauſe the Deſign of <hi>Diſcipline</hi> is anſwered by Reformation in ſuch Caſes, and much leſs ſhould it be even propoſed at all, in <hi>Matters</hi> which are (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively ſpeaking) of a <hi>doubtful</hi> Nature, and have long ſince happened; to ſay that there ſhould be no <hi>Moderation</hi> us'd in the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> of the <hi>Church, (no epeceia juris)</hi> no Variation of it's <hi>Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe,</hi> under different Circumſtances and Aſpect, in ſuch a Manner as tends to preſerve the <hi>Church</hi> from Ruin, is to ſay in <hi>effect</hi> that it is unreaſonable and indefenſible, and conſequently to impute to JESUS CHRIST the <hi>Author</hi> of it, either want of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> or want of <hi>Love,</hi> in forming the <hi>Plan</hi> or Model of it's Inſtitution, both which are falſe, and blaſphemous, and of Conſequence that from which ſuch Conſequences naturally and eaſily flow; to apply the ſame <hi>Medicine</hi> to the Body in all the Variety of it's <hi>Maladies</hi> in the ſame Manner, and in the ſame Degre, would tend to kill inſtead of a Cure, and thus it is in Eccleſiaſtical Matters. But</p>
            <p n="3">3. PEACE does not only imply a <hi>Ceſſation</hi> of <hi>Arms,</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals</hi> of <hi>Accommodation,</hi> but likewiſe our ſincere <hi>Acceptance</hi> of them, after due Deliberation upon their Nature and Importance, and with full Reſolution thro' divine Grace to adhere thereto,</p>

By this we promote the <hi>Religion</hi> of the meek and peceable <hi>Jeſus,</hi> more effectually than by all our angry Contentions and <hi>Debates,</hi> about leſſer Things; by this we adorn our Profeſſion and Character, in the Eyes of all Mankind, who are not blinded and byaſs'd by the Force of <hi>Paſſion</hi> and <hi>Prejudice;</hi> and the more numerous, and as we ſuppoſe heinous, the Offences have been that we paſs over, the more eminent, the more noble, the more Chriſt-like is our <hi>Love;</hi> becauſe it is the more free and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merited, the more ſtrong and efficacious.</p>
            <p n="6">6. PEACE implies the Performance of <hi>friendly Offices,</hi> to each other, after Reconciliation to and Union with our Brethren. O how ſtately and glorious does it look, not only to paſs by Offences, and love with our Hearts, thoſe who have done us Injury, but to delight to do them all the kind Offices in our Power, and contend with them who ſhall <hi>love</hi> moſt, and exceed each other in Courteſy and Gentleneſs, in Acts of Benignity and Endearment! This! this! my dear, reverend, honoured and beloved Brethren! is the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the holy JESUS, it breathes Sweetneſs and Mercy, it ſmells of the fragrant Spices of Heaven: O it imitates the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Dealings of the bleſſed GOD, with his poor ſinful froward Creatures, in which, are ſtupenduous Stoops of condeſcending hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Majeſty, mixed with aſtoniſhing, incomprehenſible, inexpreſſible, and unparallel'd Diſplays of the ſtrongeſt, pureſt Affection, the richeſt Benignity, and tendereſt Mercy and Love! O, the breadth, the length, the depth, the height of the <hi>Love</hi> of CHRIST which paſſeth Knowledge! Let us imitate it, dear Sirs! that we may be filled with the Fulneſs of GOD; <hi>let us walk in Love as Chriſt alſo has loved us and hath given himſelf for us, an Offering, and a Sacrifice to God, for a ſweet ſmelling ſavour.</hi> I proceed to the</p>

            </p>
            <p>NOR does Peace tend leſs to promote our ſervicableneſs to others; certainly thoſe that are Angry with us, are like to get little good by us.</p>

            <p>FROM the aforeſaid beautiful Deſcription, we may learn, that <hi>Charity</hi> conſiſts in Candor and Kindneſs, in Sweetneſs and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity, in Mercy and in Forbearance, in Forgiveneſs and Diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſtedneſs in our Converſation towards all Men; it inclines the Perſon poſſeſſed of it, to be a common Good.

            <p>BUT is <hi>Charity</hi> blind?</p>
            <p>I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> No, not quite, But yet it hopes the beſt of others, as long as it can, with any Reaſon; and when it is conſtrained by glaring Evidence, to ſee <hi>Evil</hi> in others, its View is attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Reluctance and Sorrow; and in the mean Time it makes all the <hi>Apology</hi> it can for them: Thus we do for ourſelves, and are we not commanded to <hi>love others as we do ourſelves?</hi> Charity is glad when others are vindicated from falſe Charges.</p>
            <p>BUT tho' <hi>Charity</hi> be not quite blind, yet it has not the ſharp Sight of the <hi>Lynx,</hi> in ſpying others <hi>Faults,</hi> while it is blind to its own; but inclines the <hi>poſſeſſor</hi> of it, to be moſt inquiſitive into his own Conduct, and moſt ſevere againſt the Faults of it. The Nature of <hi>Charity,</hi> or Love, as <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerves, is <hi>to cover a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Sins</hi> of our Brother. (<hi>Pro.</hi> x. 12.)

            </p>
            <p>WELL but I have a good Intention in thoſe <hi>Suſpicions,</hi> and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe good by them.</p>
            <p>I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> It's very like you have; and this indeed leſſens the malignity of your cruel Suſpicion, but it does not take it away quite; the bleſſed God does not need your Wickedneſs to promote his Cauſe and Kingdom; you <hi>muſt not do Evil that good may come.</hi> Your unreaſonable Suſpicions and evil Surmiſings of your Brother, are Inſtances of <hi>hatred</hi> againſt him: And do you think that an infinitely wiſe God can command Contradictions, namely, that you ſhould <hi>love</hi> your <hi>Brother</hi> and <hi>hate</hi> him at the ſame Time. To ſuſpect him without evident Cauſe, is unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and cruel, and every cruelty and unkindneſs is a Degree of hatred; it is ſuch Treatment as you would not like to be ſhewn to yourſelves. Is not that which is without Reaſon, unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and that Treatment which you would not have ſhewn to yourſelves, unjuſt for you to expreſs to others? And do you think that a good and holy God can approve of ſuch a Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Perverſeneſs? And is it reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that he will make it a <hi>mean</hi> to promote his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> which is <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>Peace?</hi> Surely No! Such Methods ſerve only to promote <hi>Pride, Prejudice, Diviſion, Confuſion,</hi> and every evil Work!</p>
            <p n="2">2. ANOTHER <hi>hindrance</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> that ought to be with equal Care avoided, is <hi>evil Speaking.</hi> This is contrary to the poſitive Command of God, which obliges us, to <hi>ſpeak Evil of no Man,</hi> (Tit. iii. 2.) It is repreſented as the Character of the wicked, that they <hi>whet their Tongues like a Sword, and bend their bows to ſhoot their Arrows, even bitter Words,</hi> (Pſal. lxiv. 3.) <hi>But the Words of the Pure, are pleaſant Words,</hi> (Pro. xv. 26.) And <hi>the Law of Kindneſs is in their Lips,</hi> (Pro. xxxi. 26.) Our Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, (<hi>Mat.</hi> v. 22.) <hi>That whoſoever ſhall ſay to his Brother Raca, i. e.</hi> vain Man, <hi>ſhall be in danger of the Council, but whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall ſay thou Fool, ſhall be in Danger of Hell-Fire.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>THE firſt of theſe, viz. <hi>Slander,</hi> is manifold and exceeding malignant, (Prov. x. 18.) <hi>He that hideth hatred with lying Lips, and he thut uttereth Slander, is a Fool.</hi> All Malice is folly and wickedneſs; it is ſo when concealed by Flattery and Diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Lying Lips are bad enough of themſelves, but have a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Perverſeneſs in them when made a cloak of Maliciouſneſs; and cannot be hid from God, who is Omniſcient, to him the <hi>Darkneſs is as the Light, and the Midnight as the Morning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOR is it any better when vented in ſpiteful and miſcheivous
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:006423_0052_1028DEF66AE0D650"/>
Language, <hi>he that uttereth Slander is a Fool,</hi> for God will ſooner or later bring forth that Righteouſneſs as the Light, which is hereby clouded and eclipſed, and will find an expedient to roll the unjuſt Reproach away.</p>
            <p>NOW the general Nature of the Sin of <hi>Slander,</hi> conſiſts in a <hi>falſe Accuſation</hi> of our Neighbour, which is forbidden by the ninth Command, and is a great Wickedneſs, conſidered in every ſhape and form</p>
            <p>IF it is publickly and upon Oath before civil Courts of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature, it is called, <hi>bearing falſe Witneſs againſt our Neighbour,</hi> or <hi>Perjury,</hi> which is forbidden by the ninth Command, and is an Evil of horible malignity! When we call God to Witneſs what we know to be falſe, it is one of the baſeſt Blaſphemies, the rudeſt Inſults that can be offered to the <hi>Deity,</hi> and one of the greateſt <hi>Injuries</hi> to Men that can be committed. He that invokes the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty to atteſt a <hi>Lye,</hi> either imagines that he knows not the <hi>Truth,</hi> and ſo imputes Ignorance to him; or that he is not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with it, and ſo denies his <hi>Purity,</hi> or that he is not able to avenge it, and ſo contemns his Power and Almightineſs. Now is there much difference between denying theſe Perfections of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> without which he cannot exiſt, and the Atheiſtical denial of his Being altogether? No ſurely.</p>
            <p>AND as to Men, <hi>Perjury</hi> is not only a wrong to particular Perſons, but it is <hi>Treaſon</hi> againſt human Society in general; it ſaps the very Foundations of publick Peace and Juſtice, and the private Security of every Mans Property, Honour, Life, and Fortune; yea and cruelly turns the equitable Laws, which were deſign'd for the Defence of the Inocent, and Puniſhment of the Guilty, into an Engine of Ruin to the former, and Promotion to the latter! What can be more horrible than this? Juſtly therefore does <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerve, that a falſe Witneſs againſt his Neighbour, <hi>is a Maul, and a Sword, and a ſharp Arrow.</hi> (Prov. xxv. 18) This Iniquity entails a <hi>Curſe</hi> upon the Perſon guilty of it, and his Poſterity, (Zec. v. 4.) <hi>I will bring the Curſe forth, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, and it ſhall enter into the Houſe of the Thief, and of him that ſweareth falſely by my Name, and it ſhall remain in the midſt of his Houſe, and conſume it, with the Timber thereof, and the Stones thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT when <hi>Slander</hi> is out of Court, and before a Perſons Face, and accompanied with harſh Words, it is term'd <hi>railing, (Jude</hi> 9.)

            <p>The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> compares <hi>Doeg's</hi> malicious <hi>Tongue</hi> to a ſharp <hi>Razor.</hi> And certainly ſlanderers Tongues are like Razors, that not only wound Mens Characters, but even ſometimes cut their Throats. It is an Evil that diſparages human Nature, and tends to disband civil Society altogether. It is directly contrary to the Apoſtles Exhortation, (Epheſ. iv. 31, 32.) <hi>Let all bitterneſs, and wrath, and evil ſpeaking be put away from you, with all Malice, and be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for</hi> Chriſt<hi>'s ſake hath forgiven you.</hi> The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> gives this Character of a wicked Man, (Pſal. l. 19, 20.) <hi>Thou giveſt thy Mouth to Evil, and thy Tongue frameth Deceit. Thou fitteſt and ſpeakeſt againſt thy Brother, thou ſlandereſt thy own Mothers Son.</hi> The Name <hi>Diabolos, Devil,</hi> ſignifies a <hi>Slanderer:</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Slanderer has not only the Devils Name, but his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Practice; for the principal ingredient in the Nature of the <hi>Devil</hi> is <hi>Malice;</hi> and <hi>Satan,</hi> in purſuance thereof, is the <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer of the Brethren.</hi> Both theſe the <hi>Slanderer</hi> is no ſtranger to, and therefore it is evident, he does not bear <hi>Satan's</hi> Name in vain.</p>
            <p>WHATEVER we may pretend, <hi>if we bridle not our Tongue,</hi> that unruly <hi>Member,</hi> that World of Iniquity, <hi>our Religion is in vain.</hi> And whatever ſordid Delight any one may take in doing miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to others, yet let him remember, that in due Time it will recoil upon himſelf. <hi>A Fools Mouth,</hi> ſays Solomon, <hi>is his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, his Lips are the Snare of his Soul. The Lip of Truth ſhall be eſtabliſhed forever; but a lying Lip is but for a Moment. He that walketh uprightly, walketh ſurely; but he that perverteth his Ways ſhall be known.</hi> And when the <hi>Slanderer</hi> is known, he is contemned as a publick Enemy to Society, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe others know not how ſoon they may be injured by him. All noble generous Minds deteſt this Practice, and cannot enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it with Complacence. <hi>A righteous Man hateth lying,</hi> ſays <hi>Solomon.</hi> (Pro. xiii. 5.) It is only ill natur'd People that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth

ſuch, (Pro. xvii. 4.) <hi>a wicked doer giveth heed to falſe Lips; and a lyar giveth heed to a naughty Tongue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT becauſe LYING is included in <hi>Slander,</hi> and of dreadful Tendency to Society, I ſhall ſpeak a little of its <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Malignity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>AUGUSTINE</hi> gives this Deſcription of its <hi>Nature,</hi> viz. <hi>That it is a voluntary ſpeaking of an untruth, with deſign to deceive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is a ſpeaking of an untruth, yea what we know to be ſuch; for to lye is to go againſt the Mind. <note n="*" place="bottom">Mentire, eſt contra mentem ire.</note>
            </p>
            <p>FARTHER, it is uttered with an Intention to deceive the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to whom it is ſpoken; and therefore <hi>Parables</hi> are no <hi>lyes,</hi> tho' they be not litterally true, becauſe not uttered with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to deceive, and their <hi>Scope</hi> is true; thus our Lord is called, parabolically a <hi>Door,</hi> a <hi>Rock,</hi> a <hi>Fountain.</hi> Nor are <hi>Hyperboles</hi> lyes, for the ſame Reaſon, tho they be not litterally and ſtrictly true; hence the Spies aſſerted, in their return from <hi>Canaan,</hi> that <hi>the Walls were up to Heaven;</hi> their meaning was, that the Walls were very high. In like manner it is ſaid, that if all our Lord had done was written, the World itſelf would not contain the Books; this was not expreſſed with a Deſign to deceive, but to convince of Error; the meaning was no more than that many Things CHRIST did were not Recorded.</p>
            <p>NOR are <hi>Ironies</hi> lies, tho' they be not litterally true, (1 King xviii. 27.) <hi>He mocked them and ſaid, cry aloud for he is a God.</hi> This was not uttered with a deſign to deceive, but to convince of Error, and reprove upon the Account of it.</p>
            <p>I may add, that a Perſons acting contrary to what he before ſaid, is not lying, if the Circumſtances of a Thing be altered, (Gen. xix. 2.) The Angels told <hi>Lot</hi> that they would not come into his <hi>Houſe,</hi> but abide in the <hi>Street</hi> all Night; yet upon his importunity they went in with him: And ſo <hi>Peter</hi> with ſome Ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hemency refuſed that CHRIST ſhould waſh his Feet, but when he was inſtructed in the Significancy of this Condeſcenſion of our SAVIOUR, he intreated him to do it. But in the mean Time this Caution muſt be obſerved, that the Actions be not ſuch as we are bound to by divine Precept, or ſuch as we have bound our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to, by ſome Vow to God, or ſuch that our neglect of them will be prejudicial to others; for if we have promiſed to another what is beneficial to him, however we have changed our Opinion, we muſt not change our Purpoſe, unleſs he releaſe us, or hath fail'd in the Condition of the Promiſe.</p>
            <p>DIVINES do generally diſtinguiſh <hi>Lyes</hi> into three Kinds, viz. <hi>Jocoſe, Officious</hi> and <hi>Malicious,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>JOCOSE <hi>Lyes</hi> are told to divert the Company; but it is too ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive a Method to divert others by, for ſuch as lye in Jeſt muſt expect to go to Hell in Earneſt, except they repent; beſides it prepares Perſons for that which is of a more malignant Kind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="unknown:006423_0059_1028DF1427CFE8E8"/>OFFICIOUS <hi>Lyes</hi> are told with deſign to do ſome kind Office to others; but <hi>we muſt not do Evil that Good may come.</hi> Biſhop <hi>Saunderſon</hi> juſtly obſerves upon this Head, <q>That we know not a greater Good than the Glory of God; that we know not a leſſer Sin, if any Sin may be called little, than a Jocoſe lye, yet may not this be done for that, <hi>wilt thou ſpeak wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly for God, or talk deceitfully for him,</hi> ſays <hi>Zophar</hi> to <hi>Job,</hi> and ſurely if we may not ſpeak deceitfully for God, much leſs for Man.</q> But</p>
            <p>MALICIOUS <hi>Lyes</hi> are when Perſons endeavour to fix falſe Charges deſignedly, upon the Inocent for their Hurt.</p>
            <p>NOW lying of every Kind, eſpecially of the laſt, is a Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God's Precept, which enjoins us, <hi>not to lye one to another,</hi> (Col. iii. 9.) and that we ſhould <hi>put away lying and ſpeaking guile,</hi> (Epheſ. iv. 25.)</p>
            <p>LYING is alſo <hi>odious</hi> to the God of Truth: <hi>A lying Tongue is one of the ſeven Things that are an abomination to him.</hi> (Pro vi.)</p>
            <p>LYING tends to the <hi>Deſtruction</hi> of human <hi>Society,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts the Uſe and End of Speech, which is to promote Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and Commerce, and therefore it's implicitly agreed to by all Men to ſpeak <hi>Truth</hi> to one another. But if <hi>lying</hi> be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged, how can Society be promoted, when mutual Confidence and Love are broken? Seeing that Truth is a Debt we owe to all that we converſe with, <hi>lying</hi> muſt needs be unjuſt and lead to every Injury, Violence, and Rapine. Theſe Evils naturally follow Mens making no Conſcience of performing their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and Contracts.</p>
            <p>LYING is baſe and ignoble; it juſtly brings a <hi>blot</hi> upon the <hi>Character</hi> of him who is guilty of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, when it is found out, as it generally is at the long r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n, becauſe of their Inconſiſtencies: It ſhews a baſe, cowardly Diſpoſition not to dare to tell the Truth. This Evil is not only hated by God, but by good Men. <hi>I hate and abhor lying,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>he that tells Lies ſhall not tarry in my Houſe,</hi> (Pſal. ci. 7.)</p>
            <p>LYING is an <hi>Imitation</hi> of the <hi>Devil, who when he ſpeaketh a Lye, ſpeaketh of his own,</hi> i. e. agreeable to his natural Inclination and Genius, for <hi>he is a lyar and the Father of it, he was a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer from the Beginning, and abode not in the Truth.</hi> (Joh. viii. 44) Obſerve Malice is joined with lying, in the Character of <hi>Satan;</hi> he is a <hi>Murderer</hi> as well as a <hi>Lyar,</hi> to ſhew that malicious lying is the <hi>firſt born</hi> of the <hi>Devil,</hi> the <hi>Beginning</hi> of his <hi>Strength,</hi> for by Lyes he prevailed over Mankind at firſt, and therefore this is his darling Sin. When Perſons <hi>lye,</hi> they but repeat what <hi>Satan</hi> dictates; hence is that ſaying of <hi>Peter's,</hi> (Act v. 3.) <hi>Why hath Satan fill'd thine Heart to lie unto the Holy Ghoſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LYING is not only very Criminal but very Dangerous, it cracks the Credit of the Guilty Perſon, when found out; thoſe that are accuſtom'd to lye, will not be believ'd when they ſpeak the
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:006423_0060_1028DF17055B0860"/>
Truth; and its generally found out pretty ſoon; its generally and juſtly eſteem'd to be one of the <hi>baſeſt evils,</hi> becauſe it bewrays a cowardly fear of Man, and moſt daring Contempt of GOD! whoever lyes does it out of ſome ſordid fear, leaſt ſome Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience ſhould come upon them if they told the Truth: And this <hi>Montaign</hi> in his Eſſays, gives as the Reaſon why the Charge of lying is the moſt reproachful Ignominy, which can be caſt upon any, and therefore excites Men to the moſt warm reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Indeed lying unfits Perſons for common Converſe, and for all Buſineſs. Beſides,</p>
            <p>LYING, expoſes to the Vengeance of GOD forever, <hi>(Rev.</hi> xxi. <hi>ult.) Without are Dogs and Sorcerers, and every one who loveth, and maketh a lye.</hi> (Rev. xxi 8.) <hi>And all lyars ſhall have their Part in the Lake, which burns with Fire and Brimſtone.</hi> Again,</p>
            <p>LYING is an awful Evidence of a bad State: A courſe of lying proves Perſons to be the genuine <hi>Children</hi> of the <hi>Devil,</hi> who is the <hi>Father</hi> of <hi>Lyes.</hi> On the contrary <hi>Truth</hi> in <hi>Speech,</hi> is the <hi>Character</hi> of GOD'S <hi>People, (Iſ.</hi> lxiii. 8.) <hi>Surely they are my People, Children that will not lye.</hi> Unleſs we make Conſcience of avoiding all thoſe Kinds of evil Speaking, that I have mentioned, we cannot conſiſtently or ſucceſsfully, Endeavour after Peace. But the</p>
            <p n="2">2d. KIND of <hi>evil-ſpeaking</hi> beforementioned, is RASH JUDO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING. To prevent Miſtakes, I think it neceſſary to be diſtinct and particular here, and to obſerve, that that which I oppoſe as raſh Judging, conſiſts in theſe Particulars following, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. WHEN we take upon us, to judge and condemn Men's <hi>ſecret Deſigns,</hi> in acting not made evident. And</p>
            <p n="2">2. WHEN we <hi>judge</hi> our <hi>Brother</hi>'s different <hi>Opinion</hi> from ours in <hi>Circumſtantials,</hi> and different or contrary <hi>Conduct</hi> to ours, grounded thereupon, to be a ſufficient Foundation, for concluding the State of his <hi>Soul</hi> to be <hi>bad.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="3">3. WHEN we make our Judgement of Men's State towards GOD, founded upon their ſpiritual Experience, ſeparate from Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Practice, the Ground of our <hi>publick Conduct</hi> towards them.</p>

            </p>
            <p>AS this Method of Proceeding, implies in it, a ſacreligious <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion</hi> of the <hi>Rights</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and a <hi>criminal Imitation</hi> of the <hi>worſt</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> yea, of the <hi>Devil</hi> himſelf, ſo it is directly contrary to <hi>Charity,</hi> which obliges and inclines us to hope the beſt, until there be Evidence of the contrary; and therefore in one Word, it tends utterly to eradicate all mutual Confidence from among Men, all <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Quiet,</hi> all <hi>Union, Order,</hi> and <hi>Harmony,</hi> from Church &amp; State; and to turn every Thing into the utmoſt <hi>Confuſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE ſecond Inſtance of <hi>raſh Judging,</hi> is directly contrary to the entire <hi>Series</hi> of the Apoſtle's Reaſonings, in the 14th Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> for he declares that Perſons, upon both Sides of the <hi>circumſtantial Controverſy</hi> then ſubſiſting, were ſincere and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of GOD; and informs us, that the condemning of Perſons upon the Account of ſuch ſmaller Matters, was in effect to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the <hi>Law</hi> itſelf, as an inſufficient <hi>Rule</hi> of Action, without our after Additions thereto, and an Encroachment upon our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <hi>Liberty; He that judgeth his Brother, ſpeaketh Evil of the Law, and judgeth the Law;</hi> becauſe the Law gives no ſuch Power, (<hi>Jam.</hi> iv. 11.) but aſſigns all Judgment of ſecret Things to GOD only (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> iv. 3, 4, 5.) <hi>But with me it is a very ſmall Thing, that I ſhould be judged of you, or of Man's Judgment, but he that judgeth me is the Lord, therefore judge nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Time, until the Lord come, who will bring to Light the hidden Things of Darkneſs, and will make manifeſt the Councils of the Heart, and then ſhall every Man,</hi> every good Man, <hi>have Praiſe of</hi> GOD.</p>
            <p>SOME there were in thoſe early Times, who were of <hi>Apollos</hi> and <hi>Cephas</hi>'s <hi>Party</hi> or <hi>Faction,</hi> that ſlighted <hi>Paul,</hi> judged him with raſhneſs, cenſured him with indecency, and preferred <hi>Apollo's</hi> and <hi>Cephas</hi> before him: Thoſe that bleſſed Man informs, that he eſteemed very <hi>lightly</hi> of their <hi>Cenſure</hi> or <hi>Judgment,</hi> ſo far as it concerned him <hi>(Emoi de eis elachiſton eſtin ina up humoon ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critho)</hi> The Word <hi>Elachiſton (para to elo to ephairo ab auferendo)</hi> ſignifies a very inconſiderable Thing, I eſteem it as the very leaſt of Things, whether you judge me better or worſe than others, ſincere or unſincere; I neither value nor fear the Judgment of Men; the Judgment of my value does not belong to you, nor to any of the Children of Men, nor to my ſelf; yea, I judge not my own ſelf; I pronounce no Sentence for my ſelf, I leave my ſelf to the Judgement of GOD: I may be miſtaken in my Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning my ſelf, and therefore I will affirm nothing as to myſelf, and yet I am better known to myſelf than to you; I will

not boaſt of myſelf, nor be confident of my own fallible Judgment of myſelf; nor offended with your Cenſures!</p>
            <p>THO' I am not conſcious of any willful Unfaithfulneſs, in the Courſe of my <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> yet I cannot from thence certainly conclude, that I am free from <hi>Blame,</hi> becauſe I do not perfectly know my ſelf; perhaps the Almighty ſees <hi>Blemiſhes</hi> in me, that I ſee not myſelf, perhaps I have thro' Ignorance, omitted ſomething, that was right and neceſſary, and committed ſomething that was wrong and hurtful, or forgotten ſome things wherein I did offend; we often fall into Sins we know not, ſays <hi>Chryſoſtom, ſepe incidmus, in peccata que neſhimus;</hi> in many Things we offend all.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE <hi>judge nothing before the Time, until the Lord come,</hi> i. e. <hi>ſeeing that ſecret Things belong to God,</hi> Deut. xxiii. 23. leave the Judgment of them to him, and do not judge any <hi>ſecret Thing,</hi> till CHRIST comes in the Clouds to judge the World: He only can, and he certainly will, in the Day of his Appearance, <hi>bring to light the hidden Things of Darkneſs, and make manifeſt the Councils of the Hearts,</hi> remove all diſguiſes, and make cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and fully known, all the Thoughts and Deſigns of Men.

            <p>MR. <hi>Pool</hi> obſerves in his <hi>Annotations,</hi> 
               <q>That the Original of the Winds Motion, is to us imperceptible, we can ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing philoſophically to the Cauſe of it, and can tell whether it bloweth from the <hi>Eaſt, Weſt, North</hi> or <hi>South,</hi> but we cannot tell the particular Place, where or from whence it ariſeth; ſo is every one who is regenerated, by the Working of the Spirit of GOD, changed and renewed ſo as we can give ourſelves or others no Account of it, in all Points as to the inward Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, tho' in the Effects it be diſcernable.</q>

            </p>
            <p>THE Wind moves itſelf, now here, now there, with a free and unconſtant impetus; it is a Metaphor taken from Men, like that <hi>Rom.</hi> ix. 19. to 22. a Will is aſcribed to the Wind, by the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure <hi>Proſop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>NOR is it known, where it goes, or known where it ceaſes, its Exit is no better perceiv'd than its Original.</p>

The Similitude ſhews, that the Work of Regeneration is unſearchable to human <hi>Reaſon,</hi> from whence the <hi>afflatus</hi> comes, and to what Event the Spirit operates upon, even the Regenerate themſelves do not know. To the aforeſaid Gloſs that I have given of the Words of CHRIST, agree the following Interpreters, <hi>viz. Beza, Grotius, Simachus, Chemnitus, Burgenſis,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Lightfoot.</hi>

            <p>SURELY Sirs, your Reaſon muſt inform you, that Perſons cannot judge well what they do not underſtand, and that it is not probable, they will judge impartially, of a Caſe in which they are <hi>Parties</hi> and <hi>Accuſers,</hi> and that it is unjuſt for them to judge what does not belong to them, or what they have no Commiſſion or Authority for.</p>

What Part of the <hi>Bible</hi> contains your <hi>Commiſſion?</hi> Methinks, it is but reaſonable, that you ſhould either produce it, or quit your <hi>Office? Who art thou that judgeſt another Man's Servant?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT after you have aſſumed the <hi>Judge</hi>'s Office, pray how do you manage in that Buſineſs? Do you therein conform to the common and rational Courſe of judicial Proceedings, and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of good Judges? Do you hear with <hi>Patience</hi> the Defendant's <hi>Apology</hi> for his Conduct, and <hi>examine</hi> it <hi>thoroughly,</hi> before you paſs Sentence? And are you of <hi>Council</hi> to him? Do you examine all Parts of his <hi>Apology</hi> with Candour, putting a <hi>favourable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction</hi> on Things that appear doubtful, as far as <hi>Reaſon</hi> will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, being loth to find your fellow-Creature guilty of what is criminal and diſhonourable to human Nature? Farther, do you lay the <hi>Streſs</hi> of your Sentence only upon Things that are plainly prov'd? <hi>(allegatis et probatis)</hi> And do you paſs your Sentence of Condemnation with <hi>Grief</hi> and Reluctance, from a Principle of Juſtice attended with Humanity? Being willing that ſeveral guilty

Perſons ſhould eſcape with Impunity, rather than that one innocent Perſon ſhould ſuffer? For the former is only inconvenient, but the latter unjuſt.</p>
            <p>ARE not every of theſe Particulars now mentioned, agreeable to the cleareſt Dictates of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and plaineſt Maxims of <hi>Equity?</hi> And if the Conduct of any of us has been, or is diſagreeable thereto, is it not condemned by both? Pray let us conſider ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, theſe few Paſſages of Scripture following; (Prov. xviii. 13.) <hi>He that anſwereth a Matter before he heareth it, it is a Folly and Shame unto him,</hi> (Pſ. cxxxi. 1.) <hi>Lord my Heart is not haughty, nor mine Eyes lofty, neither do I exerciſe myſelf in great Matters, or in things too high for me.</hi> (Jer. xvii. 9.10.) <hi>The Heart is deceitful and deſparately wicked, who can know it?

and properly ſignifies, to diſcern, apprehend, or diſtinguiſh, and ſo it is tranſlated in the Verſe immediately preceeding, and in many other Places of Scripture, (ſee Mat. xvi. 3) <hi>O ye Hypocrites ye can</hi> diſcern <hi>the Face of the Sky, but can ye not</hi> diſcern <hi>the Signs of the Times.</hi> (1 Cor. xi. 29.) <hi>Not</hi> diſcerning <hi>the Lord's Body.</hi> (Act. xv. 9.) <hi>and put no</hi> difference <hi>between us and them.</hi> (1 Cor. xii. 10.) <hi>to another</hi> diſcerning <hi>of Spirits.</hi> (Heb. v. 14) <hi>who by Reaſon of uſe have their Senſes exerciſed to</hi> diſcern <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween good and evil.</hi>

            <p>ALL THINGS. Obſerve it is not <hi>Perſons</hi> that are repreſented as diſcerned by the ſpiritual Man, but <hi>Things;</hi> and the Word ALL, muſt be underſtood with that Reſtriction the Context leads us to, viz. All the peculiar and important <hi>Myſteries</hi> of Chriſtianity, which are abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation or the Method of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which the Apoſtle had been diſcourſing of, thro' the ſeries of this Chapter. To underſtand the Word ALL in an abſolute unlimited Senſe, charges <hi>falſehood</hi> upon the Apoſtle; for we are ſure that every ſpiritual Man, nay not one of them in this Life, underſtands <hi>all Things,</hi> both natural, civil and religious; and if the Word be reſtricted to <hi>religious Matters,</hi> yet without limitation, it is not true: Every ſpiritual Man underſtands not the whole Syſtem or Analogy of Faith, in all its Branches, and their mutual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and Dependencies. Nor do many of them underſtand the Chronological Difficulties of the Scriptures, or perceive the great variety of their Rethorical Charms, and Elegancies, &amp;c. So that the true meaning of the Words, is no more than this, that the regenerated Perſon diſcerns, apprehends and diſtinguiſhes the grand <hi>peculiars</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel Method</hi> of <hi>Salvation,</hi> by the <hi>Death</hi> of the SON of GOD, diſcerns Things that are abſolutely neceſſary to his own Salvation, in ſome Meaſure.</p>
            <p>BUT he himſelf, in the mean Time, is diſcerned or known cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, by none, by no Man; and hence God's People are called his <hi>hidden ones,</hi> (Pſa. lxxxiii. 3.) And ſpecial Grace in them, is called the <hi>hidden Man of the Heart.</hi> (1. Pet. iii. 4.) and <hi>their Life is</hi> ſaid to be <hi>hid with Chriſt in God,</hi> (Col. iii. 3.) and that <hi>the World knoweth them not.</hi> They are not only unknown to the World, who generally eſteem thoſe that are pious as Fools, wicked or miſerable Perſons, but even in part to themſelves, becauſe many of them feel the divine Life in them weak and doubtful, becauſe of their inward <hi>Corruptions,</hi> becauſe of <hi>Temptations,</hi> of the World, the Devil and the Fleſh.</p>
            <p>IT is farther obſervable, that pious People are <hi>ſealed,</hi> (Epheſ. iv. 30.) <hi>And grieve not the holy Spirit whereby ye are ſealed to the Day of Redemption.</hi> (2 Cor. i. 22.) <hi>Who hath alſo ſealed us, and given the earneſt of the Spirit in our Hearts.</hi> And in divers other Places God's People are repreſented as the <hi>ſealed ones.</hi> Now e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one knows that the Deſign of a <hi>Seal</hi> is not only <hi>Security</hi> and <hi>Confirmation,</hi> but <hi>Secreſy</hi> alſo; and hence <hi>Letters</hi> are ſealed up to this Purpoſe.

of</hi> CHRIST, <hi>written not with Ink, but with the Spirit of the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, not in Tables of Stone, but in the fleſhly Tables of their Hearts.</hi> (2 Cor. iii. 3.) not only to ſignify the reality and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manency <note n="*" place="bottom">Litera ſcripta manet.</note> of the good Impreſſions made upon them by the Apoſtles Miniſtry, thro the divine Concurrence therewith; but alſo the <hi>Secreſy</hi> of thoſe Impreſſions. The <hi>ſprings</hi> of <hi>Action</hi> in good Men are hid from all Men, and therefore the <hi>State</hi> of their Souls, which may ſaid in ſome Senſe, to be built thereupon, is certainly diſcerned by no Man.</p>
            <p>But do we not read of that Gift of <hi>diſcerning</hi> of <hi>Spirits</hi> being given?</p>
            <p>I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Yes, we read of it in 1 Cor. xii. 10. <hi>To another the working of Miracles, to another Propheſy, to another diſcerning of Spirits, to another divers Kinds of Tongues.</hi> 
               <q>This was a Power, ſays <hi>Pool,</hi> wherein God for the farther Authority and Credit of his Goſpel, in the Primitive Times, communicated to ſome Men ſomething of his own <hi>Prerogative,</hi> to diſcern Mens inward Thoughts and Hearts, and to make up a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Truth and Sincerity; or contrawiſe of their Falſehood and Hypocriſy.</q> This was an extraordinary and admirable faculty given even to private Men, to diſcover and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove fanatical Spirits, and falſe and develiſh Prophets, of which there were many at that Time. (1 Joh. iv. 1) And hence the falſe Pretender is ſaid <hi>to be convinced of all, and judged of all,</hi> (1 Cor. xiv. 24.) or as the original Word ſignifies, <hi>diſcerned of all.</hi> But this Gift ſeems to have been eſpecially given to ſuch as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided <hi>(pro tempore)</hi> among the Presbiters, who often met to judge of this Matter. (1 Cor. xiv. 29—33.) <note n="†" place="bottom">To the aforeſaid purpoſe, for Subſtance, ſpeak the following learned Men, <hi>Beza, Grotius, Eraſmus, Pool, Cameron, Lightfoot, Man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THIS was a miraculous Gift as well as the reſt joined with it in the ſame Verſe; ſo that for any to pretend to it now, when miraculous Gifts are ceaſed, is the vaineſt Vanity! Nor have we any Reaſon to believe their Pretences, unleſs they can ſpeak with <hi>Tongues</hi> they have never learned, or unleſs they can ſpeak the <hi>ſick</hi> whole, and the <hi>Dead</hi> alive in an Inſtant, without the Uſe of Means.</p>
            <p>I THINK it his highly probable, that it was by this Method of Miraculous <hi>diſcerning,</hi> that the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> try'd thoſe, which ſaid they were Apoſtles, and were not, and upon Tryal found them to be Lyars; becauſe it was the eaſieſt, ſpeedieſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, and did at that Time obtain in the Church.</p>
            <p>BUT if it was not ſo, they doubtleſs try'd them by their <hi>fruits,</hi> that is by their <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Lives,</hi> ſay <hi>Piſcator,</hi> and <hi>Beza;</hi> the Pretenders falſely ſaid they were Apoſtles, immediately ſent in an extraordinary Manner as <hi>Paul</hi> was: Now an excellent Method of knowing ſuch, ſays <hi>Grotius,</hi> was if they privately ſought after

Money, which they pretended to contemn; then it appeared that they were ſuch who are diſcrib'd, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 13.) <hi>And found them to be Lyars, i. e.</hi> diſcover'd their deceits. Many falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets had gone forth, of which they had ſufficient warning, (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> i. 3. <hi>Acts</hi> xx. 29, 30.) Among which were the Heritical <hi>Ebion</hi> and <hi>Cerinthus</hi> and his followers, who feign'd they had their Revelations from an Apoſtle of the firſt Rank; ſo <hi>Cluverus, Brightman, Pareus,</hi> and <hi>Hammond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW neither of theſe Methods, give the leaſt Handle for <hi>Raſh-Judging.</hi> The firſt being <hi>Miraculous,</hi> has long ſince expir'd; and the laſt being <hi>external</hi> only, does not in the leaſt Countenance making our <hi>Opinion,</hi> of ſpiritual <hi>Experience</hi> (in Particulars) a Term of <hi>Communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT does not our LORD aſſure us, that we may judge the Tree, by the Fruits.</p>
            <p>I ANSWER our LORD informs us, that we may <hi>know</hi> the Tree by the Fruits, (<hi>Mat</hi> xii. 33.) Our Saviour does not propoſe a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, but only a probable Sign, he ſpeaks of Things as they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen generally, as <hi>Maldonate</hi> juſtly obſerves; he does not ſay that a bad Tree cannot become good, but that while it is bad, it cannot bring forth good Fruit. (i. e. ſpiritually good) a bad Tree cannot bring forth good Fruits, unleſs it be engrafted, and a good Tree will bring forth bad, if it be not cultivated; ſays <hi>Tertullian.</hi>

            <p>CHRIST'S memorable Negative <hi>Precept,</hi> mention'd (<hi>Mat.</hi> vii. 1, 2, 3.) ſtrongly confirms what has been now ſaid, <hi>Judge not that ye be not judg'd, for with what Judgment ye judge, ye ſhall be judged, and why beholdeſt thou the Mote, that is in thy Brothers Eye, but conſidereſt not the Beam that is in thy own Eye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT which is here forbidden, ſaith <hi>Pool</hi> in his Annotations, <q>is either, 1ſt. Raſh-Judgment of his State, or a judging him for doing his Duty, ſuch was <hi>Simons</hi> or the Diſciples Judgment reſpecting the Woman, (<hi>Mat.</hi> xxvi. 6, 7.) Or, 2d. A Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of others, for Things, which they judge to be indifferent, forbidden. (<hi>Rom.</hi> xiv. 1, 2, 3.) Or, 3d. a Judging of them for ſecret Things, ſuch as inward Habits of Grace, when no apparent Fruits to the contrary are ſeen, or a condemning others for ſingle Acts, or a Publick cenſuring others for private failings.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>FOR with what Judgment ye judge, ye ſhall be judged;</hi> that is, <q>the ordinary Temper of Men and Judgment of GOD, will not leave ſuch a Practice unrewarded,</q> they are generally paid in this World in their own Coin, <hi>good Meaſure, preſſed down and runing over.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE ſame worthy Author farther obſerves from that ſaying of our Saviour, <hi>And why beholdeſt thou the Mote that is in thy
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:006423_0072_1028DF421D2B0698"/>
Brothers Eye, but conſidereſt not the Beam that is in thine own,</hi> theſe Things following. <q>1. That thoſe who are moſt cenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious of others, are uſually more notorious themſelves, if not for the ſame Sins; yet for others of equal if not greater Magnitude. 2d. That it is notorious <hi>Hypocricy,</hi> to ſpy ſmaller faults in others, and not to ſee greater in ourſelves. 3d. that is notorious Impudence, to pretend to Cenſure and Judge others, for Sins in which we live ourſelves. 4th. That there is no ſuch Way to teach us <hi>Charity,</hi> in not haſtily, raſhly, or too ſeverely judging others, as to look firſt into our own Hearts and Ways, and ſeeing if we have not the ſame, or greater fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Our <hi>Charity</hi> in this Kind ſhould begin at home.</q>
            </p>
            <p>GIVE me leave to conſider one <hi>Objection</hi> more, which is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the denial of our <hi>Judgment</hi> about, or certain <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of Mens ſpiritual <hi>Experiences</hi> and gracious State by them, renders our exerciſing a ſpecial <hi>love</hi> towards them, impracticable, which is nevertheleſs a commanded <hi>Duty,</hi> and otherthrows the <hi>Communion</hi> of Saints, which we profeſs our belief of in the Apoſtles Creed.</p>
            <p>I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> That the aforeſaid Conſequencies do not fairly and neceſſarily follow, becauſe our charitable <hi>Hope</hi> concerning the good State of others, grounded on their <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Lives,</hi> is ſufficient to excite our ſpecial Reſpect to them as <hi>Brethren,</hi> and Communion with them as ſuch; and our conferring ſpecial Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon them, as being of the Houſhold of Faith.</p>
            <p>WHAT our Lord aſſerts, (<hi>Mat.</hi> x. 41, 42.) ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms this; the Words are theſe, <hi>He that receiveth a Prophet in the Name of a Prophet, ſhall receive a Prophets reward; and he that receiveth a righteous Man, in the Name of a righteous Man, ſhall receive a righteous Man's reward: And whoſoever ſhall give to drink unto one of thoſe little ones, a Cup of cold Water only, in the Name of a Diſciple, verily I ſay unto you, he ſhall in no wiſe looſe his Reward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW to receive them <hi>in the Name of a Prophet, Righteous Man,</hi> or <hi>Diſciple,</hi> is to receive them in <hi>quality</hi> of ſuch, or <hi>as ſuch;</hi> not becauſe they are rich, powerful, learned, eloquent, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to us, but becauſe they bear the <hi>Character</hi> of <hi>Miniſters</hi> of CHRIST, or religious Perſons, and appear ſo to us, by Reaſon of their regular Admiſſion into the Miniſtry, Doctrines and Lives; or if of a private Station, by their Principles and Practice only. Now our Lord informs us, that if we be miſtaken in our charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Opinion</hi> of them, and <hi>Kindneſs</hi> towards them, yet if we have been ſincere in our <hi>Deſigns</hi> therein, we ſhall not miſs a gracious and liberal <hi>Reward,</hi> even for the moſt <hi>minute Inſtances</hi> of our <hi>Generoſity,</hi> if proportioned to our <hi>ability:</hi> The Lord will look upon ſuch Kindneſſes as done to himſelf. Thus <hi>Grotius, Mead,</hi> and <hi>Pool,</hi> interpret the aforeſaid memorable Scripture.</p>
            <p>IF it had been the Will of God, that we ſhould have farther Grounds than I have mentioned, for the performance of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:006423_0073_1028DF4A1706D238"/>
Duties, he would have expreſſed it ſomewhere in his Word, and enjoined us to ſeek after it, as well as directed us how to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage ſo difficult and important an Affair, and given us a Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city equal to it, as well as ſome Examples (in all probability) of ſome pious Men that had attempted to perform this arduous Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of <hi>ſearching</hi> the <hi>Heart;</hi> but of theſe Things the Scriptures of Truth, which ought to be the <hi>Rule</hi> of all our Sentiments and Conduct in religious Matters, are entirely ſilent, ſo far as I know, excepting the Caſe of miraculous diſcerning, which I have ſpoke of before, and does not concern the ordinary Times and State of the Chriſtian Church in Point of Practice.

            <p>FRAUD and Injuſtice, breaking of our Words, over-reaching in our Bargains, taking advantage of the Neceſſities of the Poor to oppreſs them, and grind their Faces, and all other Methods of Circumvention, the whole <hi>Myſtery of Deceit,</hi> are exceeding Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, but if any or all of theſe Things are done under a <hi>Cloak</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> they are much more heinous: This makes the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Religion ſtink in the Noſtrils of others, and ſtrengthens their natural Prejudices againſt all Religion, <hi>O therefore let us not go beyond and defraud one another, ſeeing God if the avenger of all ſuch.</hi> Some of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were of this Stamp; for a Pretence they made long <hi>Prayers, that they might devour Widows Houſes:</hi> Such accurſed Practices have doubtleſs occaſion'd that infamous Proverb, viz. <hi>That in the Name of God every Evil begins.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. TRUTH, Agreement in <hi>eſſential</hi> and neceſſary <hi>Truths, Now we beſeech you Brethren by the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that ye all ſpeak the ſame Things, and that there be no Diviſions among you</hi> (or <hi>Schiſms</hi> as it is in the Original, <hi>Chiſmata) but that ye be perfectly joined together in the ſame Mind, and in the ſame Judgement,</hi> (1 Cor. i. 10.)</p>
            <p>BY <hi>Schiſms,</hi> the Apoſtle means new <hi>Factions, Sects</hi> and <hi>Parties</hi> within the <hi>Church,</hi> whereby it is <hi>torn, Ferments</hi> promoted in its <hi>Bowels,</hi> the Affections of the People uncharitably and unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly alienated from each other, not upon the Account of Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in Eſſentials of <hi>Doctrine, Worſhip,</hi> or <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> but <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial Matters;</hi> while ſome gloried in this, and ſome in the other <hi>Patron;</hi> ſome <hi>carnally</hi> crying up <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſome <hi>Apollos,</hi> and ſome <hi>Cephas,</hi> to the <hi>Diſparagement</hi> of each other, and the <hi>Prejudice</hi> of the Church's <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Union;</hi> ſo <hi>Calvin, Beza, Pareus, Grotius,</hi> and <hi>Symachus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Conduct of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> upon this critical Occaſion, was truly amiable, and worthy of a Miniſter of JESUS CHRIST, he refuſed their immoderate <hi>Reſpect,</hi> and ſpake DIMINUTIVELY of HIMSELF, with Deſign to ſtop the perilous CAREER of the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> in making new <hi>Parties, Sects,</hi> and <hi>Factions,</hi> and ſetting <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> at the <hi>Head</hi> of one of them, he would by no Means accept of ſuch a falſe <hi>Honour,</hi> to the Prejudice of CHRIST'S <hi>Kingdom,</hi> No! He abhorr'd it! He would rather be condemned and deſpis'd by the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> than condemned by GOD, and his own <hi>Mind;</hi> for being the Inſtrument of <hi>uncharitahle Schiſms</hi> and <hi>Factions!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HE therefore nobly ventures his <hi>Character</hi> in the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of GOD, the Cauſe of the Church's <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Union,</hi> and fearleſsly expoſes himſelf to all the <hi>Fury</hi> of their <hi>Reflections,</hi> for his <hi>Fidelity</hi> to his Maſter: <hi>Reflections</hi> which were as unreaſonable as they were well intended.</p>
            <p>THAT bleſſed Man, endeavoured to ſtop the violent <hi>Torrent</hi> of <hi>Faction,</hi> by addreſſing the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in this humble Language,</p>
            <p>BUT <hi>is</hi> CHRIST <hi>divided? Was</hi> Paul <hi>crucified for you? Or were ye baptiz'd in the Name of</hi> Paul? 1 Cor. i. 13. How came theſe Parties? There is but one CHRIRT.

            <p>TO theſe I may add the Obſervance of the <hi>Order</hi> CHRIST has inſtituted, and the joint or ſocial Performance of religious <hi>Duties,</hi> which the Words <hi>joined together</hi> and <hi>compacted</hi> import, as was obſerved before, which Duties are of noble Tendency to promote and preſerve <hi>Union</hi> among ourſelves.</p>
            <p>FROM all which I would obſerve, that when any of theſe Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are neglected, the <hi>Edification</hi> and <hi>Increaſe of</hi> CHRIST'S <hi>Body myſtical</hi> is <hi>oppos'd</hi> and marr'd.</p>
            <p n="4">4.

            <p>BUT by Peace and Union, on the Terms before obſerv'd, GOD is <hi>glorify'd,</hi> in our <hi>obedience</hi> to his <hi>Precepts,</hi> and <hi>Conformity</hi> to his <hi>attributes, Religion</hi> is <hi>honoured,</hi> by a real, a viſible and amiable <hi>Repreſentation,</hi> of its peaceful, kind and beneficent <hi>Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE viſible Church is <hi>ſtrengthened,</hi> and made awful to its inveterate Enemies, its implacable oppoſers: Our own <hi>Minds</hi> are <hi>delighted</hi> with the moſt agreeable proſpect and ſweet Senſations; and others Benefit is thereby promoted, for being at Peace with them they are the more ready to receive our Council and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs!</p>
            <p>BUT ſhou'd we join with thoſe who we fear are Graceleſs?</p>
            <p>I Anſwer the <hi>Terms</hi> of Church <hi>fellowſhip,</hi> that GOD has fix'd are ſoundneſs in the Main <hi>Doctrines</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> and a <hi>regular Life;</hi> a <hi>Heritick</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>after the firſt and ſecond Admonition reject; him that is weak in Faith receive ye, but not to doubtful diſputation: Receive one another, as CHRIST has received you, to the Glory of GOD.</hi>

and regular in <hi>Life,</hi> we ought to hope well of them, till they prove the contrary by their Practice; and receive them to <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, Charity thinks no Evil, and hopes all Things, that are good;</hi> whatever <hi>jealouſies</hi> we may have and perhaps ſinful ones, they ſhould be kept <hi>Secret,</hi> and not divulg'd to our Neighbours <hi>Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,</hi> and far leſs made <hi>Terms</hi> of <hi>Communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE ſtandard of our <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Maſter</hi> we muſt buckle to, and not follow our own fickle and often partial and byaſs'd <hi>Fancies</hi> and Humours. The aforeſaid <hi>Terms</hi> that CHRIST has fix'd are invariable and perpetual, nor can we add to them, without reflecting upon his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Fidelity,</hi> and invading his incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable <hi>Royalty,</hi> without rebelliouſly attempting to commenſe <hi>Kings</hi> in his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> contrary to his <hi>Order,</hi> and robbing his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the <hi>Liberty,</hi> wherewith he has made them Free.</p>
            <p>THE aforeſaid Terms that <hi>Chriſt</hi> has fix'd may be certainly known, and therefore they are <hi>rational.</hi> But ſome of the novel and ſuperſtitious <hi>Terms,</hi> which ſome good Men have invented, tho' with a pious deſign, are <hi>irrational,</hi> becauſe they cannot be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly known, unleſs it be ſuppos'd that Churches are infallible in their Determinations; a claim which the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> (ſome Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſts excepted) have not pretended to, at leaſt in Words; but the Bible is a ſtranger to ſuch Terms of Communion. I know not one Paſſage in it, that proves converting Grace, or the Churches Judgment of it, to be a Term of Chriſtian <hi>Communion</hi> of divine Appointment. If any think otherwiſe, let them prove it, and I will give an attentive Ear, and readily ſubmit to their Inſtruction and Correction: But I humbly conceive, they will find it a hard taſk, without producing another Bible. <note n="*" place="bottom">I can't find that the Chriſtians of the three firſt Centuries after CHRIST made gracious experiences, or the Church's Judgment about them Terms of Communion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they made no Enquiries about them as to Baptiſm, and all that were Baptiz'd, and of adult Age, and free from Church Cenſure, were admitted to the Sacrament.</note>
            </p>
            <p>BUT muſt not we adhere to our former Teſtimony to Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion?</p>
            <p>I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Yes, and we do ſo by declaring our aſſent to the Holy Scriptures, and by maintaining our excellent <hi>Weſtminſter Confeſſion of Faith</hi> and <hi>Catechiſms,</hi> which open the Nature, and aſſert the Neceſſity of Converſion agreeable to the ſacred Oracles.</p>
            <p>AND as to our fallible Opinion concerning the late religious Appearances, which is a diſtinct Thing from the Doctrine of Converſion in general; we may and ought to maintain it, but in a conſiſtency with Peace, Love and Charity.</p>
            <p>THERE is a vaſt difference between our holding our uncertain <hi>Opinion</hi> concerning the <hi>reality</hi> of this or that Inſtance of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and our impoſing it upon others as a <hi>Term</hi> of <hi>Communion,</hi> either Miniſterial or Chriſtian.

know, of which Kind particular Inſtances of a Work of Converſion in any (in our Times) undoubtedly are, as a Term of Church Fellowſhip, refuſing to join with them in Communion, until they be of their Sentiment; ſhould either produce their Charter from the Holy-Scriptures, for ſuch an extraordinary claim of Power, for ſuch an unprecedented kind of Proceeding, or at leaſt be ſilent, if they are not free to do what perhaps they urge upon others, viz. to confeſs their <hi>Error</hi> in <hi>Principle,</hi> and <hi>Indiſcretion</hi> in <hi>Practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF they can't prove a <hi>Difference</hi> of <hi>Opinion</hi> from theirs, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome Inſtances of a Work of Coverſion (for more or leſs don't alter the Kind) in others of our Times, and ſince the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity, to be a fundamental <hi>Article</hi> of Religion, their Cauſe is entirely loſt: And if they can, Fundamentals are built upon a very precarious Bottom indeed; and how to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between ſuch <hi>Fundamentals</hi> and <hi>Circumſtantials,</hi> is I confeſs vaſtly beyond the Reach of my Underſtanding: At this rate of Proceeding, the Number of <hi>fundamental Articles,</hi> will encreaſe or change every Age; for every Man's Converſion, with all its Circumſtances, makes one of the Number: If this Method be followed, ſhall we not have a goodly Multitude of <hi>Fundamentals?</hi> Our <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> will ſwell to a bulk much ſuperior to the late <hi>Univerſal Hiſtory,</hi> twenty Volumns of which have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready printed, and a great Part left yet undone.</p>
            <p>IN ſhort, ſuch a Sentiment ſeems to me to be equally contrary to Scripture, Reaſon, Antiquity, and the Peace and Union of the Churches of CHRIST.</p>
            <p>INASMUCH as good Men may and do differ in Opinion about ſuch uncertain Things. Witneſs the Meſſrs. the <hi>Erſkines</hi> and their followers, with others that might be mentioned. To make them <hi>Terms</hi> of Communion, will oblige us to caſt out of Church Fellowſhip, thoſe that are ſound in the main Doctrines of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and regular in Life, whom CHRIST commands us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; and therefore it directly oppoſes his Authority. Beſides as it is an Addition to the <hi>Terms</hi> which the KING of the Church has fix'd, it is an Invaſion of his Royalty, and an Infringement upon our Brothers Liberty.</p>
            <p>IS it not unreaſonable to make that a <hi>Term</hi> of <hi>Communion</hi> which we cannot certainly know, for hereby ſuch as ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived are in Danger of being rejected, as CHRIST himſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves in his <hi>Parable</hi> of the <hi>Tares.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHAT <hi>Church</hi> from the Foundation of the World to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Times, ever made the open acknowledgment of ſome Mens Judgments, concerning the reality of ſome Inſtances of <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> carried on in their Times, without the Teſtimony of <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> a <hi>Term</hi> of Miniſterial <hi>Communion.</hi> I confeſs I know of no Inſtance of this <hi>kind,</hi> in <hi>Scripture,</hi> or <hi>Hiſtory.</hi>

            <p>EXCELLENT Mr. <hi>Durham,</hi> one of the moſt pious, judicious and calm Divines of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation, fully confirms what I have been now obſerving, in his truly valuable Treatiſe of <hi>Scandal,</hi> a Book well worthy of our ſerious peruſal.</p>
            <p>BUT as to <hi>Offences</hi> in Conduct, occaſioned by different <hi>Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> in <hi>Circumſtantials,</hi> the Caſe is ſtill more plain, that urging of acknowledgments, when <hi>Controverſies</hi> between the contending Parties are dropt, is unreaſonable and unjuſt, not only in an Infant and broken State of the Church, but even in a Church united and form'd; the Reaſon is, becauſe it implies our <hi>impoſing</hi> upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers our <hi>Sentiments</hi> in Matters comparitively <hi>doubtful,</hi> contrary to the Command of GOD, which obliges us to <hi>receive</hi> the <hi>Weak,</hi> or thoſe that <hi>err</hi> in <hi>Circumſtantials</hi> only, but not to <hi>doubtful Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations;</hi> what Chriſt has left free, we ſhould leave ſo too.</p>

No. Inſtead hereof, he expreſly enjoins them to <hi>receive the weak.</hi> He was ſo far from the Severity mentioned, that he did not ſay explicitly which Party was in the Right, or which was in the wrong, as to the Matters they contended about; but made charitable <hi>Apologies</hi> for both, as to their <hi>States</hi> towards God, and their pious <hi>Deſigns</hi> in contrary Practices, reſpecting the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters then controverted among them, <hi>He that regardeth the Day, regardeth it unto the Lord; he that regardeth not the Day to the Lord, he doth not regard it.</hi>

            <p>IN the mean Time he reproved them ſmartly for their ſinful <hi>judging</hi> of each other, and well he might: for that God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking, Church rending <hi>Iniquity,</hi> was unſpeakably worſe than a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>IS it whither ſome have not been <hi>converted,</hi> in the ſucceſſive <hi>Ages</hi> of the Chriſtian <hi>Church,</hi> from the Apoſtle's Times to the preſent Day, and whether ſome have not been converted in this <hi>Age,</hi> and in this Part of the World, and whether Good has not been done, and ſome effectually changed to all Appearance during the late <hi>Revival</hi> of Religion?

            <p>AND is our OPINION concerning what we cannot certainly know, a great Matter think ye?

            <p>MOREOVER, I muſt in Juſtice add to what has been offered, that the <hi>Reverend Brethren,</hi> who caſt us out of Synodical Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, do deny the <hi>Charge</hi> of <q>endeavouring to prejudice People againſt the <hi>Work</hi> of GOD'S <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> in the

Converſion of Sinners, wherever there were any hopeful Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of it.</q>
Mr. <hi>John Thomſon,</hi> in their Name, obſerves upon this Head as follows,</p>
            <p>
               <q>IT is true, there are ſome Things in our Brethren's Conduct, which we cannot but condemn; and have condemned and ſpoken againſt both in private and publick; and ſome Things alſo which are the frequent Effects of their Preaching on many of their Hearers, which we cannot ſo highly eſteem of, as both they and their Admirers do.</q> Among which he mentions <hi>crying out aloud</hi> in the midſt of the Congregation, in the Time of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip; and others <hi>falling down</hi> half dead, or working like Perſons in Convulſion Fits. And in another Paragraph, he ſpeaks in the following candid charitable Strain, to the <hi>Honour</hi> of the late <hi>Revival</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> as well as the <hi>Honour</hi> of the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> he <hi>oppoſed,</hi>
               <q>It is true, ſince our <hi>Brethren</hi> have thus <hi>intine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,</hi> there are, as I am informed and partly <hi>know,</hi> a <hi>great many</hi> who are ſtirred up to have more <hi>ſerious Thoughts</hi> about their <hi>Soul</hi>'s Concerns than ever they had before; which is a Thing truly to be <hi>rejoiced in;</hi> and many, it's ſaid, are much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, in ſeveral Particulars of moral Practice, which alſo is juſt <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>Satisfaction;</hi> may the Lord grant that it may be more and more ſo.</q> And elſewhere he ſpeaks in the following Chriſtian-like humble Strain,
<q>As to the general Complaint which Mr. <hi>Blair</hi> in his Introduction makes, concerning the low State of Religion, and experimental Godlineſs, and the Influence which the Negligence and Remiſneſs, of <hi>Miniſters</hi> in the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their <hi>Office</hi> and Station, have upon the ſame, I <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> that I believe there is too much Ground for it; and that it is juſt Matter of Mourning and Lamentation, to all who have the <hi>Welfare</hi> of <hi>Zyon,</hi> and Proſperity of Souls at their Heart; yea, I am firmly perſuaded, that our Barrenneſs and Fuitleſſneſs under the Means of Grace, the Decay of vital Godlineſs in both Miniſters and People, our too great Eaſe and Contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with a lifeleſs, lukewarm Orthodoxy of Profeſſion, is one principal Evil whereby our GOD hath been provoked againſt us, to ſuffer us to fall into ſuch <hi>Diviſions</hi> and <hi>Confuſions,</hi> as we are now viſibly involv'd in. And O, that the Lord, by his holy Spirit, would ſend a <hi>Reviving</hi> to his own <hi>Work</hi> in the <hi>Hearts</hi> and <hi>Lives</hi> of both <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>People.</hi>
               </q> In another Part of the ſame Book he ſpeaks thus,
<q>However, <hi>we rejoice</hi> that the great GOD, who over rules all Events for his own Glory, and the Good of his Church, doth make the <hi>Goſpel</hi> preach'd by theſe <hi>Brethren, effectual</hi> in many, to ſtir them up to a more ſerious Conſideration of their Soul-Concerns, than ever before. I alſo hope that our gracious Lord will give us, who are in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, Grace to obſerve and obey his Voice by his Providence to us, to ſearch and try our Ways, and turn again unto the Lord; to ſearch out our own real Faults and ſhort comings, in our Chriſtian and Miniſterial Capacity, and to ſtudy Repentance

and Reformation, as there is great Need we ſhould; the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Lifeleſneſs and Lukewarmneſs of the preſent Age, no doubt hath had too much Place with us, and Influence upon us, may the Lord teach us now to hear the rod, and who hath appointed it, and without delay to obey his Call to us thereby.<note n="*" place="bottom">See his Book upon the Government of the Church of CHRIST, Pages 29, 32, 33, 34, 48.</note> And in Page 119. he ſaith, 'Whatever be the inſtrumental or inferior Cauſe of this our confus'd di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, melancholy Condition; we may be ſure the Lord is pleading a Controverſy with us; we certainly have offended and provok'd him to anger againſt us, and ſo to ſuffer a Spirit of DIVISION and DISCORD to get footing among us.</q>
And having made mention of ſeveral prevailing Evils, he ſays,
<q>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it to be doubted, but that we who are in the Miniſtry, are in no ſmall Degree juſtly chargeable with the Guilt of theſe Evils, on various Accounts; by our perſonal Guilt of thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding Sins; by our not bearing Teſtimony againſt them with that Zeal the Caſe requires, both doctrinarily and in a diſciplinary Way; by our not mourning over them, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting with due ſorrow of Heart before the Lord; by our too lax and untender walk in our own private Converſation; by our being too Carnal in our converſing with our People and one another.—And farther I think it not unlikely that God in his infinite Wiſdom, hath permitted our <hi>Brethren,</hi> who appear to be ſo MUCH MORE ZEALOUS then WE for carrying on a WORK of CONVERSION—which they apprehend is wholly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected by us, as it is indeed too much, to be Inſtruments in the Lord's Hands to chaſtiſe us for our neglects and ſhort comings.</q>
            </p>
            <p>NOW ſeeing the Reverend Mr. <hi>John Thomſon</hi> appeared as the <hi>Appologiſt</hi> of the preſent SYNOD of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> it may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably preſum'd, that he ſpeaks the Mind of at leaſt the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of that Body; and therefore it is evident from the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Paſſages, that they were far from oppoſing (with Deſign) the late REVIVAL of RELIGION; that on the contrary they expreſly ACKNOWLEDGED it, REJOYC'D in it, and PRAY'D for its INCREASE; yea and in ſeveral Inſtances as HUMBLY as PUB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LICKLY ACKNOWLEDG'D their own Imperfections in Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the preſent Debate. Do not the aforeſaid Paſſages, breath the <hi>candid</hi> and <hi>humble Spirit</hi> of <hi>ſincere Chriſtianity?</hi> Why therefore is this ſtring of <hi>Acknowledgment</hi> ſo much har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped upon? Pray have we done in this as much as our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren? Or are we forſooth abſolutely Perfect and Infallible even in a Time of Temptation and Debate? For my own Part, I muſt declare my utter abhorrence of inflexible <hi>Stifneſs</hi> in our own Juſtification in every Thing in ſo perplexing a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, of ſo long Continuance, as well as of unrelenting Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gours and Severities againſt our Brethren.</p>
            <p>O that the God of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> would in Mercy give us all
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:006423_0096_1028DFA6D0395200"/>
ſuch a <hi>pacifick Temper,</hi> as the very Reverend Dr. <hi>Bates</hi> aſcribes to excellent Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his Funeral Sermon, in the following Words,
<q>His pacifick Spirit was a clear Character of his being a Child of God. How ardently he endeavour'd to <hi>cement</hi> the <hi>Breaches</hi> among us, which others widen and keep open, is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly known. He ſaid to a Friend, I can as willingly be a Martyr for LOVE as for any Article of the Creed. 'Tis ſtrange to aſtoniſhment, ſaith the Doctor, that thoſe who agree in the ſubſtantial and great Points of the reform'd Religion, and are of differing Sentiments only in Things not ſo clear, nor of that moment as theſe wherein they conſent, ſhould ſtill be oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Parties. Methinks the Remembrance how our Diviſions lately expos'd us to our watchful Adverſary, and were almoſt fatal to the Intereſt of Religion, ſhould conciliate our Affections. Our common Danger and common Deliverance ſhould prepare our Spirits for a ſincere and firm Union. Integrity, with Charity, would remove thoſe Things that have ſo long diſunited us.</q>
What Dr. <hi>Bates</hi> obſerves, is agreable to that excellent <hi>Maxim, in neceſſariis unitas, in non neceſſariis Libertas, in omnibus charitas.</hi> In fundamentals Unity, in circumſtantials Liberty, and in all Things Charity. O its pity that this does not univerſally obtain among the Children of Men!</p>
            <p>BUT are we not enjoined to <hi>turn away from thoſe that have Form of Godlineſs, but deny the Power thereof,</hi> (2 Tim. iii. 5.)</p>
            <p>I anſwer, thoſe whom the Apoſtle adviſes <hi>Timothy</hi> to turn away from, were both <hi>prophane</hi> in <hi>Practice,</hi> and <hi>heretical</hi> in <hi>Sentiment:</hi> for thus he deſcribes them in the Context, <hi>covetouus, boaſters, proud, blaſphemers, diſobedient to Parents, unthankful, unholy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out natural Affection, (aſpondei make bates)</hi> ſuch as will be held by no Bonds, or rather as the Word is tranſlated, <hi>Rom.</hi> i. 31. <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable,</hi> Men ſo full of Malice, that they will admit of no Terms of <hi>Peace. Falſe Accuſers, (Diaboloi</hi> DEVILS, for ſo the Word ſignifies) <hi>incontinent,</hi> FIERCE, and <hi>deſpiſers of them that are good, Traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of Pleaſure, more than lovers of GOD: Men of corrupt Minds, roprobate concerning the Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT, why then are they ſaid to have a Form of Godlineſs? <hi>(Morphoſin)</hi> a <hi>Maſk</hi> or Viſor.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, they had in it <hi>Speech</hi> in Pretence, but not in <hi>Practice</hi> or Power; they pretended to a right Way of worſhipping GOD, and to be the only true Church; and this was all: And therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rules of the Goſpel, they were not fit Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to aſſociate with.</p>
            <p>BUT was not the Prophet enjoined to <hi>take forth the Precious from the Vile?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ANSWER, Yes: That is, ſaith <hi>Pool,</hi>
               <q>He was to ſeparate the precious <hi>Truths</hi> of GOD, from the vile <hi>Conceits</hi> of <hi>Men;</hi> or rather to preach ſo, as to diſtinguiſh good and bad Men from one another.</q>
To the ſame Purpoſe ſpeaks Mr. <hi>Henry,</hi> in his <hi>Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi>
               <q>That the Good and Bad ſhould be diſtinguiſhed in our
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:006423_0097_1028DFA9E5396370"/>
Preaching, not by their <hi>Names,</hi> but by their <hi>Characters,</hi> and each have his proper Portion given him.</q> To the like Effect ſpeak <hi>Piſcator</hi> and <hi>Calvin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN there is a Breach of <hi>Union</hi> in a <hi>Society,</hi> ſhould not that Party that is moſt in the right, tarry, till the other ſue for Peace?</p>
            <p>I anſwer with Mr. <hi>Durham,</hi> No: The more they are in the Right, and the leſs Need they have of Peace upon their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, the more ſelf-denying and noble are their innocent humble Condeſcentions, their early and earneſt <hi>Suits</hi> for <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Union</hi> for GOD'S ſake, and for his <hi>Kingdom</hi>'s ſake, and not for their <hi>own!</hi> The <hi>Religion</hi> of JESUS, is not a buſineſs of <hi>Pride,</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> or <hi>Stoutneſs,</hi> (that hangs on haughty <hi>Ceremony</hi>) but of <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Self-denial;</hi> the more of theſe Graces we have, and exerciſe, the more we imitate the bleſſed IMANUEL, and the more we partake of, and expreſs the <hi>Spirit</hi> of his <hi>Religion,</hi> and conform to its important aad truly noble <hi>Deſign.</hi> Surely as <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerves, <hi>It is a Glory to paſs over a Tranſgreſſion, but for Men to ſearch their own Glory, it not Glory. He that hath no Rule over his own Spirit, is like a City that is broken down, and without Walls, but he that is ſtow to Anger is better than the Mighty; and he that ruleth his Spirit, than he that taketh a City.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF it be ſaid, that there is no Neceſſity of this <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Union,</hi> we are well enough as we are.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, that there is always a <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of <hi>Obedience</hi> to GOD'S commanding <hi>Authority,</hi> nor are we ever well, but while we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to comply therewith. Now is it not the Command of GOD, that we ſhould <hi>pray for the Peace of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and keep the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace?</hi> If we ſhould keep <hi>Unity</hi> when we have it, ſhould not we labour to recover it when it is loſt?</p>
            <p>BUT perhaps ſome may object, to this Purpoſe, that to join with a Company of dead Men, is the ready way to make us deader than we are.</p>
            <p>ANSWER, It is cruel and cenſorious Judging, to condemn the States of thoſe we know not; and to condemn poſitively and openly the ſpiritual <hi>States</hi> of ſuch as are ſound in <hi>fundamental Doctrines,</hi> and <hi>regular in Life.</hi> The Way to obtain quickning Grace, is the Path of <hi>Duty,</hi> and not the ſcandalous Practice of that God-provoking and Church-rendring <hi>Iniquity</hi> RASH-JUDGING, this may quicken indeed, but not to any Thing that is good: but to <hi>Back-biting, Slandering, Wrath, Malignity,</hi> and all Manner of Miſchief! O! that a gracious GOD would open the Eyes of the Children of Men, to ſee the inexpreſſible Baſeneſs and Horrors of this deteſtable IMPIETY, that is pregnant with inumerable <hi>Evils!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AGAIN, it may be objected, that we are enjoined in divers Places of Scripture, to beware of <hi>Wolves</hi> in Sheep's cloathing, of <hi>Dogs,</hi> of <hi>Foxes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, theſe <hi>Places,</hi> and others of like tendency, if they are ſtrictly examined, together with the Context, where they are
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:006423_0098_1028DFAE65C38AA0"/>
they will be found to reſpect in my OPINION, primarily, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally and directly <hi>erroneous</hi> and <hi>heretical Teachers,</hi> ſuch may be known, and ſuch ſhould be with Care avoided; but to <hi>ſeparate</hi> from ſuch as are ſound in eſſential and neceſſary Articles, of Faith, regular in Life, and edifying in their Miniſtry, meerly or only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they differ from us in ſome circumſtantial Points which they do not impoſe, or are judg'd by us to be unregenerate, is uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, unſcriptural, and of dangerous Tendency! As this Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice wants a divine <hi>Warrant,</hi> ſo it puts the Peace and Union of the viſible Church of CHRIST, upon a very uncertain and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious <hi>Bottom,</hi> and opens a <hi>Door</hi> to inumerable miſchevious and ſcandalous <hi>Rents</hi> and <hi>Diviſions!</hi> And if it be ſinful to make a Breach on ſuch a Foundation, (which has been ever my Opinion, tho' now I confeſs, thro' GOD'S Mercy, I have a more diſtinct and enlarged View of the Caſe than formerly,) it muſt needs be ſo to keep up the <hi>Breach,</hi> to neglect or refuſe reaſonable <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> upon ſuch a Foundation.</p>
            <p>IF it be farther ſaid, that the <hi>Church</hi> is now in a cold <hi>declining State,</hi> and that when there was more <hi>Livelineſs,</hi> and more Good done, no Propoſals of <hi>Peace</hi> or <hi>Union</hi> were made, nor was there any Proſpect of it.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, the <hi>Church</hi> is now in its ordinary <hi>State,</hi> in which Men being <hi>calm,</hi> can beſt examine and judge concerning the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> altho' not ſo many are alarmed out of their <hi>Security,</hi> as ſome Time ſince, yet thro' divine <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> ſome are awakened and to Appearance <hi>converted;</hi> and the <hi>Body</hi> of CHRIST is <hi>edify'd,</hi> for which there is great Cauſe of Thankfulneſs. We are not wont to think it a bad <hi>Year,</hi> in temporal Reſpects, becauſe we have not ſuch an extraordinary <hi>Harveſt,</hi> as in the ſeven plenteous <hi>Years</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> when the <hi>Earth brought</hi> forth by <hi>Handfuls,</hi> or as the <hi>Jews</hi> had every ſixth Year in <hi>Canaan,</hi> when thro' the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing Bleſſing of GOD, the Earth brought forth Fruit ſufficient for three Years.</p>
            <p>SOME Years paſt, the <hi>Church</hi> in this <hi>American Wilderneſs,</hi> was in an extraordinary Situation, by Reaſon of a very uncommon <hi>Effuſion</hi> of divine <hi>Influence,</hi> in the <hi>Conviction,</hi> and <hi>Converſion</hi> of <hi>Sinners,</hi> (to all Appearance) in much greater Numbers than what is uſual, but the <hi>Ignorance</hi> of ſome, and corru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>FARTHER, there was as hopeful Appearances, of miniſterial

               <hi>Succeſs</hi> before the <hi>Breach,</hi> as after, and this is certain, that <hi>Breaches</hi> of <hi>Communion,</hi> being <hi>carnal,</hi> have no Tendency to <hi>Succeſs</hi> or any <hi>Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF the Objection could be <hi>prov'd,</hi> which I believe cannot, yet it would conclude nothing: The variable <hi>Frames</hi> of Men's <hi>Minds,</hi> and <hi>Succeſſes</hi> of their <hi>Labours,</hi> which a Sovereign GOD diſpenſes with infinite <hi>variety,</hi> can be no <hi>Rule</hi> of Action to us, to the <hi>Law</hi> and to the <hi>Teſtimony.—Duty</hi> is ours, but <hi>Events</hi> are GOD'S.</p>
            <p>SUCCESS in a great degree, will not prove thoſe that have it to be right in all their <hi>Sentiments,</hi> and <hi>Conduct</hi> reſpecting <hi>leſſer Things.</hi> No! a gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>BUT if we are in any Meaſure grown <hi>cold,</hi> the beſt way to obtain quickning, is to <hi>obey</hi> the bleſſed GOD in <hi>praying</hi> and <hi>ſtriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> as much as in us lies, for the <hi>Peace</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> The <hi>Path</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> ſo far as is conſiſtent with eſſential and neceſſary Truths, is certainly the Way which God himſelf has chaulk'd out, to obtain that quickning which is of the right Kind.</p>
            <p>BUT does not our joining with thoſe that hold <hi>circumſtantial Errors,</hi> imply our Approbation of them?</p>
            <p>I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> No, by no means! No more than our joining with imperfect People, infers our approving all their Imperfections. For if the Caſe was ſo, it would be altogether ſinful to unite into a Church State, becauſe all are imperfect, <hi>there is no Man that liveth and ſineth not,</hi> but that God who cannot look upon Sin but with abhorrence has appointed a Union in Churches and therefore the other is falſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="unknown:006423_0100_1028DFB32B1E3928"/>BESIDES the Almighty commands us to <hi>receive the Weak,</hi> as I have before obſerved, or ſuch as Err only in Circumſtantials. Now if our joining with them in Church fellowſhip, neceſſarily included, our Approbation of their Errors, then it would follow, that the GOD of <hi>Truth</hi> commanded us to approve of <hi>Error,</hi> which is impoſſible and blaſphemous. No our joining with them only ſhews, our mutual Agreement in <hi>eſſential</hi> and <hi>neceſſary Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,</hi> and our <hi>Charity</hi> for them, as Children of the Kingdom, or rightful Members of the <hi>viſible Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT may be again objected, that <hi>Paul</hi> being beaten publickly by the Magiſtrates, uncondemn'd declined to go out of the Priſon privately, till they came and fetched him, (<hi>Act.</hi> xvi. 37.)</p>
            <p>I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> That in Order to underſtand this Scripture aright, it ſhould be obſerved, that by the <hi>Porcian</hi> and <hi>Sempronian</hi> Laws, it was utterly unlawful to beat a <hi>Roman</hi> Citizen unleſs the Sentence of Death had been pronounced upon him; and ſtill more ſo when the beating was publick, and the Cauſe unheard; ſo <hi>Cicero, Heſiod, Appuleius,</hi> and <hi>Tertulian</hi> Witneſs, with many others.</p>
            <p>ACCORDING to the Conſtitution of ſaid Laws, when a <hi>Roman</hi> Citizen was wronged, the Majeſty of the <hi>Roman</hi> People was reckon'd to be wronged or les'd, ſays <hi>Grotius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW the <hi>Pagan</hi> Magiſtrates of <hi>Philippi,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Colony, being ſtirred up by the Clamours of the People, broke the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Laws in ordering <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> to be beaten publickly and impriſon'd, who were not condemn'd to Death, being ignorant they were Roman Citizens: The Apoſtle knowing that when the Magiſtrates came to underſtand this, they would be terrified with the Apprehenſion of incurring the Diſpleaſure of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire for ſo manifeſt a Violation of their Laws, (<hi>Act.</hi> xxii. 29) and therefore ready to come into ſome Condeſcentions to prevent it; prudently declined going out of Priſon directly, in a private manner as they were deſired, and inſiſted on the Magiſtrates com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves and bringing them out, alledging that they were <hi>Romans.</hi> This the Apoſtle probably did to prevent future Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of the like Kind; and partly to vindicate their Characters from the Imputation of Crimes that demerited ſuch ſcandalous corporal Puniſhment.</p>
            <p>GROTIUS obſerves juſtly, that <hi>Paul</hi> knew how to uſe the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Laws for the Defence of Inocence and a good Cauſe.</p>
            <p>BUT can any Body think, that the Apoſtle wou'd have ſtay'd ſome Years in Priſon, when he had Liberty to go out in Caſe the Magiſtrates had delayed their coming ſo long. No! Surely.</p>
            <p>IN a Word, we are to learn from this Inſtance, the neceſſity of human <hi>Prudence,</hi> eſpecially in Affairs of a civil Nature, and therefore it is foreign to the Point in Debate: The caſes are not parallel, which appears thus, in the one, the Perſons Offending were Pagan <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> the <hi>Offence</hi> was upon <hi>one ſide only,</hi> the Offence was of a <hi>civil Nature,</hi> depriving the Apoſtle of the right of a <hi>Roman</hi> Citizen: The Offence was committed againſt the
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:006423_0101_1028DFBA6800D840"/>
civil Laws of the Land, as well as againſt the Law of Nature di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly. But in the other Caſe, the Perſons offending are <hi>Brethren,</hi> of the ſacred Character, profeſſing the ſame fundamental Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Chriſtian Religion; the <hi>Offences</hi> are not againſt the civil Laws of the Land, nor againſt the Law of Nature, (directly) but have been occaſioned by difference in Opinion about Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantials in Religion; the Offences have been mutual in a greater or leſſer degree, in Matter or Manner of management; the Offences are not properly of a civil Nature.</p>
            <p>NOW ſeeing the <hi>Caſes</hi> are not <hi>parallel,</hi> no juſt inference can be drawn from the one to the other, of deffering Endeavours after Peace and Union, until the Party that is moſt in the fault, come firſt into ſome Condeſcenſions in order to it; and indeed as it is in itſelf unjuſt to draw the ſame Concluſion from different Premiſes, ſo it likewiſe makes the Apoſtle contradict himſelf, for in the 14th Chap. of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> he exhorts Parties contending about Circumſtantials, to come into a Peace and Union without ſuch Preliminaries; nor is it reaſonable that any one ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect his Duty becauſe another neglects his; for if ſo, he may poſſibly neglect it during Life, and thus make void the Law and yet be guiltleſs. But ſuppoſing the Caſes were parallel, the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Inſtance would not conclude, for there has been a delay al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready of ſeveral Years, and we do not know that the Apoſtle delay'd ſo much as one Day</p>
            <p>BUT don't miſtake me, I am for <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Union,</hi> tho' I inſiſt upon Acknowledgment.</p>
            <p>I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> It may be ſo in <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Intention,</hi> but not in <hi>Deed.</hi> Is it not very inconſiſtent in a Caſe of Debate of a long Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, wherein are mutual complaints of Miſconduct, flowing from a difference of Sentiment in leſſer Things, for one of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to urge Acknowledgment, and yet pretend <hi>Peace,</hi> ſeeing it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly tends to renew the War? For the Right of <hi>Self-Vindication</hi> is equal upon both Sides; and if one has a right to require Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, ſo has the other, and doubtleſs will in ſuch a Caſe; for ſelf-love is common to all, and a due Degree of it is but reaſonable. This ſevere Method therefore of courſe brings upon the Carpet all the dormant Controverſies that have been between the contending Parties, and loudly ſummons them to War and Arms, both offenſive and defenſive: This excites them reſpectively to defend their own Conduct, and to charge and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminate upon the others; and hence the Churches <hi>Wounds</hi> are like to <hi>bleed</hi> afreſh, and the <hi>Breach</hi> inſtead of being healed will be widen'd: For how can Men, with a good Conſcience, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that to be wrong which they don't ſee to be wrong? And where has God obliged us upon pain of Excluſion from Church fellowſhip, to be of one Opinion in every little Thing? And thus in this Way, the Churches Peace and Union are like to be perpetually prevented. Now can we ſuppoſe reaſonably that the All-wiſe God in order to promote <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Union</hi> (in a Caſe
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:006423_0102_1028DFBC4AAEAA38"/>

For by the ſame Rule that one <hi>circumſtantial</hi> of human Invention is made a <hi>Term</hi> of <hi>Communion,</hi> a Thouſand may be made; and then what will become of the Churches <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Union?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT do not we by coming into a <hi>Union</hi> without <hi>Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> give up the Work of GOD?</p>
            <p>I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> No. We do and may retain our Opinion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it till Death, only we do not make it a <hi>Term</hi> of <hi>Communion</hi> to others, for which we have no Authority in the Scriptures. Did the inſpir'd Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> adviſe the <hi>Gentile</hi> Chriſtians to give up the Truths reſpecting <hi>Liberty,</hi> for which they contended, when he exhorted them to receive the <hi>Jews</hi> to <hi>Communion,</hi> that deny'd them? If yea, then the <hi>Bible</hi> is wrong! For the aforeſaid <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> is of the ſame Original with the reſt of the Scriptures. If nay, the Objection vaniſhes! If every Thing we believe muſt be made a <hi>Term</hi> of <hi>Communion,</hi> or it is given up, there can be no Church on Earth, becauſe there can ſcarce be found any that are agreed in every Thing.</p>
            <p>IF it be ſaid, that oppoſing the late <hi>revival</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> is worſe than open <hi>Immorality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> It is a great <hi>miſtake,</hi> which appears thus, all muſt acknowledge that <hi>Sins</hi> againſt <hi>light,</hi> are worſe then thoſe that flow from <hi>Ignorance</hi> or <hi>Miſtake;</hi> becauſe there is a greater <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi> of God's <hi>Authority</hi> in them, than in the other. <hi>If I had not come and told them, they would not have had Sin, but now their Sin remains; now they have no Cloak for their Sins.</hi> This ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſelf evident <hi>Maxim</hi> eaſily applies itſelf thus, <hi>groſs Iniquities</hi> againſt the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> are againſt the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> which is common to all, and hard, if poſſible, to be quite extinguiſh'd,

It is true, if they did it againſt clear Light and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction to the Contrary, it would be a dreadful <hi>Evil;</hi> but none can ſay this in the preſent Caſe, except they take upon them the peculiar <hi>Province</hi> of GOD, to <hi>judge</hi> the ſecret <hi>Thoughts</hi> of the <hi>Heart,</hi> and break the Law of <hi>Charity,</hi> both which heinous Evils, we ſhould with equal Care avoid.</p>
            <p>AND if they did it from <hi>Miſtake,</hi> it's vaſtly leſs faulty than <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral Conduct.</hi> Now to require an <hi>acknowledgment</hi> of them upon this <hi>account</hi> includes one or other of theſe two Things, <hi>viz.</hi> either 1ſt. Our impoſing our Opinion upon them, or obliging them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve as we believe, upon pain of excluſion, in a Matter compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritively doubtful, without a divine Warrant, yea contrary to a divine <hi>Precept,</hi> which enjoins to <hi>receive the Weak.</hi> Or elſe 2d. It includes our obliging them to act contrary to their <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi> viz. in acknowledging that to be wrong, which they think to be Right. Now ſeeing, as the Apoſtle informs us, <hi>he that doubteth is damned if he eat, becauſe he eateth not of Faith,</hi> i. e. if one does what he doubts is unlawful to be done, he commits a damnable Sin, or a Sin that deſerves Damnation; and therefore to urge Acknowledgment in this Situation of Things, is in effect to deſire a Man to offend God and damn his Soul; or to do that which wounds and enſnares the Soul, and merits ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Ruin! I believe indeed that thoſe that urge <hi>Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> have no ſuch <hi>Deſign,</hi> have no ſuch <hi>view</hi> of the <hi>Caſe,</hi> but this is the real Language of the <hi>Principle,</hi> the true State of the Matter. Now judge calmly and impartially in your own Minds, if both the aforeſaid Particulars be not exceeding unreaſonable and ſinful?</p>
            <p>NOR can I ſee any poſſible <hi>Medium</hi> between the aforeſaid dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous <hi>extreams,</hi> but mutual <hi>forbearance:</hi> For if there is any Right to urge Circumſtantials, and acting agreeable to them, as <hi>Terms</hi> of <hi>Communion;</hi> the Right is equal upon both Sides of the Queſtion, and then there muſt be contrary <hi>Acknowledgments,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the ſame Thing: Which every <hi>Eye</hi> may ſee are abſurd and rediculous!</p>
            <p>THE Apoſtle has directed us to the aforeſaid Medium in a Caſe of the ſame Nature, (<hi>Rom.</hi> xiv. 22.) <hi>Haſt thou faith have it to thy ſelf before GOD, happy is he that Condemneth not himſelf, in that Thing, which he alloweth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>UPON which Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> in his <hi>Annotations</hi> ſpeaks as follows,
<q>He does not ſpeak of Faith in the fundamentals of Religion,
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:006423_0104_1028DFC109FF0178"/>
this muſt be profeſs'd, and acknowledg'd, let who will be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, but of Faith in indifferent Things, (which are the ſubject Matter he is treating of) our believing or perſwaſion therein, is not to be unſeaſonably utter'd, or declar'd, ſo as to occaſion Scandal or Contention,; an excellent Aphoriſm reſpecting all, eſpecially the Stronger and more knowing Chriſtian; the Senſe is, he is a happy Man that when he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a Thing to be lawful, he doth ſo manage the Practice of it, that he hath no Reaſon to accuſe or condemn himſelf, or elſe that inwardly doth not condemn himſelf for doing that againſt his Conſcience, which he openly alloweth or practiceth: Such a one is happy in this reſpect, becauſe he is free from thoſe Terrors that torment thoſe who act againſt their Conſciences.</q> And ver. 20 of the ſame Chapter, <hi>for Meat deſtroy not the work of God; all Things indeed are pure, but it is evil for that Man who eateth with Offence, i. e.</hi> by ſharp Contentions about circumſtantial Things. Do not <hi>deſtroy the work of God.</hi> What is that?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer, Peace</hi> and <hi>Union,</hi> which GOD worketh among believers, ſays <hi>Pool</hi> in his <hi>Annot.</hi> And indeed of this the Apoſtle ſpeaks in the Verſe immediately preceeding. <hi>Love,</hi> ſay <hi>Toletus, Beza, Meno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius,</hi> and this is the ſame for Subſtance with the former; for <hi>Love</hi> is the Source of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Union,</hi> or beginning <hi>Piety</hi> in your weak Brother, ſays <hi>Eſtius.</hi> Or your Neighbour, whom God has made religious, ſo <hi>Menochius.</hi> All theſe Gloſſes are very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent; the Sum of the whole is, do not diſturb the publick <hi>Peace,</hi> or break the <hi>Union</hi> of <hi>Societies,</hi> or weaken brotherly <hi>Love,</hi> or injure your Brothers Soul, by angry <hi>Debates</hi> about <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantials;</hi> all which unhappy Effects, ſuch needleſs Contentions do frequently produce. Here is advice worthy of an Apoſtle, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, or rather a poſitive <hi>Command,</hi> of great weight and moment, well would it be for the Churches if it was better underſtood and obſerved by the bulk of Mankind.</p>
            <p>I may add, that it ſhould be ſeriouſly examined, and conſider'd, whether none were <hi>acceſſary</hi> to the <hi>Oppoſition</hi> which others made to the late <hi>Revival</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> by treating them hardly, and condemning their <hi>States,</hi> upon an inſufficient Foundation, and ſo guilty in ſome <hi>Degree</hi> of what they themſelves ſo warmly <hi>oppoſe;</hi> and whether they are as ready and zealous to make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments of this themſelves as to require it of others?</p>
            <p>IN the mean Time, it ſhould be alſo ſeriouſly enquired, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Perſons not being convinced by ſufficient Evidence, was not unreaſonable, and their expreſſing their private <hi>Sentiments</hi> in ſuch a Manner as had a tendency to offend their <hi>Brethren, ſinful,</hi> tho' I will not dare to encroach upon my <hi>Brothers Liberty,</hi> or <hi>judge</hi> his <hi>Conſcience;</hi> Yet this I may ſay, that <hi>Liberty</hi> may be ſo us'd as to give <hi>Cauſe</hi> of Offence, and occaſion ſtumbling and prejudice.</p>
            <p>IF any upon either Side of the Queſtion ſhould object againſt

a <hi>re-union,</hi> that there is Corruption in <hi>Principle,</hi> or Evil in <hi>Practice,</hi> in any one of either of the <hi>Bodies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> That I hope there is no ſuch <hi>Cauſe</hi> of <hi>Complaint,</hi> upon either Side, as ſome perhaps have <hi>ſuppos'd.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n Byaſs, and partly thro' <hi>Miſinformation,</hi> which very much abounds in Times of <hi>Contention.</hi> But if the Caſe was really ſo, I think with judicious, pious and peaceable Mr. <hi>Durham,</hi> that it is an Argument for, and not againſt a <hi>Union;</hi> becauſe in a State of <hi>Union</hi> theſe Things may be much better remedied, than in a divided State.</p>
            <p>NOR ſhould <hi>Reports,</hi> of an ungenerous <hi>Uſe,</hi> made by ſome, of the <hi>Conference</hi> for <hi>Accommodation,</hi> obſtruct or diſcourage our <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt</hi> and <hi>earneſt Endeavours</hi> for <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Union,</hi> upon <hi>Scriptural Terms.</hi> I hope Things are not quite ſo as they are repreſented. When People are divided and prejudiced againſt each other, they are apt, thro' the force of their <hi>Paſſions,</hi> to miſapprehend one anothers meaning, which of Conſequence they miſ-relate; beſides after long <hi>Debates,</hi> Perſons are under ſtrong <hi>Temptations</hi> in order to make themſelves appear <hi>Conſiſtent,</hi> or ſupport what they call their <hi>Credit,</hi> to ſpeak of Things that ſhould be <hi>buried</hi> in ſilence, in an <hi>undue Manner,</hi> which has a very bad tendency.</p>
            <p>IT is certainly a very lamentable Evil, to prefer what we are apt to reckon our <hi>Credit,</hi> to the <hi>Peace</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of GOD. On the Contrary, it is our real <hi>Credit,</hi> in the Account of an All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe GOD, and of all ſuch as are judicious and free from the Byaſs of Prejudice, to deny ourſelves, and condeſcend, as far as we can with Inocence, for <hi>Peace. Solomon</hi> truly obſerves, <hi>that it is an Honour to ceaſe from Strife,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT the very Appearance of <hi>Prejudice</hi> in ſome, ſhews the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of a <hi>Union</hi> to remove it. Nor can this, after a wide <hi>Breach</hi> and long <hi>Debate,</hi> be ordinarily obtained without <hi>Difficulty</hi> and <hi>Uneaſineſs;</hi> but it is better to bear a medicinal <hi>Pain</hi> in order to a <hi>Cure,</hi> than to let the <hi>Diſtemper</hi> grow <hi>deſparate,</hi> thro' a total neglect of proper Means. The advantages of a <hi>Union</hi> to the Kingdom of CHRIST, obtain'd upon an equitable <hi>Foundation,</hi> would much preponderate ſuch temporary Diſquietudes.</p>
            <p>IF any ſhould ſay, that it is wrong and dangerous to <hi>re-unite</hi> to a ſet of <hi>diſorderly Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> It is true; it is unreaſonable to unite to ſuch as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the <hi>Eſſentials</hi> of that <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> which CHRIST has appointed in his Word.</p>
            <p>BUT perhaps the true State of this Caſe has, thro' the heat of <hi>Debate,</hi> either not been thoroughly underſtood by ſome, or not ſufficiently attended to.</p>
            <p>HERE if it be enquired, what <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd in the late Time of <hi>Contention</hi> among us.</p>
            <p>WAS it the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> in the Church of CHRIST in general? No.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="unknown:006423_0106_1028DFC903AE8910"/>WAS it the <hi>Nature</hi> of that <hi>Government</hi> which the <hi>Scripture</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes? No.</p>
            <p>WAS it that <hi>Plan</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> which is expreſſed in our <hi>Directory,</hi> agreeable to the <hi>Scriptures?</hi> No.</p>
            <p>WAS it what was reckon'd <hi>fundamental</hi> in our <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> by the Majority? No.</p>
            <p>WHAT then was the <hi>Core</hi> of the <hi>Controverſy?</hi> Why ſome <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantials</hi> in <hi>Government;</hi> or in other Words, ſome <hi>Rules</hi> or <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> form'd by the Majority, and reckon'd <hi>pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> and <hi>expedient</hi> by them; but on the Contrary, <hi>prejudicial</hi> and <hi>ſinful</hi> by the Minor Party.</p>
            <p>NOW it may be conſidered, whether it be not at leaſt as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable to make <hi>Circumſtantials</hi> in <hi>Diſcipline, Terms</hi> of <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> as <hi>Circumſtantials</hi> in <hi>Doctrine?</hi> And if ſo, whether what has been before ſaid againſt ſuch Things, as <hi>Terms</hi> of <hi>Communion,</hi> does not conclude here with equal Evidence?</p>
            <p>NO doubt a <hi>ſmaller Number</hi> ought freely to ſubmit to the <hi>Concluſions</hi> of the <hi>Majority,</hi> in Matters relating to <hi>Government,</hi> which they (the Majority) judge <hi>eſſential</hi> to the <hi>well-being</hi> of the Church: For without this, there can be no <hi>Government</hi> at all: Without this the <hi>Minor Party</hi> would have <hi>Power</hi> to impoſe upon the <hi>Major,</hi> in Things which they reckon of the laſt <hi>Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>uence</hi> to the good of the Society; which is abſurd.</p>
            <p>IT is true, the <hi>Major Party</hi> may be miſtaken as well as the <hi>Minor,</hi> and conſequently abuſe their <hi>Power,</hi> for which there is no help in the preſent imperfect State of Things, but humble Remonſtrating by Reaſon and Argument: Yet conſider'd as a <hi>Society,</hi> the Majority have a right to <hi>judge</hi> for themſelves, (upon the <hi>Plan</hi> of private Judgment) what they reckon <hi>eſſential</hi> to their <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> or to the <hi>well-being</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> under their Care, and conſequently to exclude from their Society ſuch as do not comply therewith.</p>
            <p>MOREOVER, even in Matters that are reckon'd <hi>Circumſtantial</hi> by the <hi>Majority,</hi> the <hi>Minor Party</hi> ought, for <hi>Peace ſake,</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, if they be not <hi>Conſcience</hi> bound in the <hi>Matter;</hi> but if ſo they cannot; and whether <hi>Forbearance</hi> ſhould not be exercis'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, in this, as well as other parallel Caſes, I leave to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to determine.</p>
            <p>IT will not do for any to ſay, that we are <hi>ſurely Right,</hi> we are <hi>certainly Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, The great Degree of our <hi>Confidence</hi> will not prove us to be ſo; for then two Contraries would be Right; ſeeing that <hi>Confidence</hi> is generally equal in <hi>Degree</hi> upon both Sides of the Queſtion, and never ſtronger than in doubtful Matters.</p>
            <p>EITHER there is an abſolute <hi>Promiſe,</hi> that all good Men ſhall be ſet right in every ſmall circumſtantial <hi>Matter</hi> in this Life, or there is not. If there is, then one of theſe two Things will follow neceſſarily, <hi>viz.</hi> Either that the <hi>Promiſe</hi> is not fullfil'd, which charges unfaithfulneſs upon GOD, or that all true <hi>Chriſtians</hi>
               <pb n="100" facs="unknown:006423_0107_1028DFCAF5D806F0"/>
are reduc'd to one <hi>Party,</hi> and to a ſmall Number of that Party, which is as <hi>uncharitable</hi> as the other is <hi>blaſphemous:</hi> For there are perhaps ſcarcely Ten of a Thouſand of religious People, even of the ſame Denomination, that exactly agree in every minute Point of <hi>Religion.</hi> Well if there be no abſolute <hi>Promiſe</hi> in Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Circumſtantials;</hi> then it unavoidably follows, that we have no firm <hi>Foundation</hi> for ſuch a great degree of <hi>Confidence;</hi> and therefore ſeeing it is either without <hi>Foundation</hi> altogether, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportioned in Meaſure to its <hi>Foundation,</hi> it is as fooliſh as it is pernicious.</p>
            <p>BUT the Matter of <hi>Difference</hi> is of great <hi>Moment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I <hi>anſwer,</hi> It is eaſy and natural to think ſo in Matters that we are engaged in, becauſe in ſuch Caſes, our <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Humour</hi> are apt to be affected; which thro' our dreadful <hi>Degeneracy,</hi> our <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Corruption,</hi> we are apt to prefer at leaſt for a <hi>Time,</hi> to the moſt important <hi>Things, viz.</hi> the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Union</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s viſible <hi>Kingdom</hi> among Men.</p>
            <p>OUR <hi>Affections,</hi> are apt to give a ſecret wrong <hi>Byaſs</hi> to our <hi>Minds,</hi> which we ourſelves diſcern not ſo that while we are criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally and warmly Spying and Cenſuring others ſuppos'd or real <hi>Miſtakes</hi> and <hi>Blunders,</hi> we over look our own: Our Affections incline us to look upon both what we <hi>like</hi> and <hi>diſlike,</hi> in a <hi>mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying Glaſs,</hi> which ſoons turns, to our heated <hi>Imaginations, Muſketoes</hi> into <hi>Mountains,</hi> and ſo unhappily, but equally, miſleads us in our judgment, both as to the <hi>Objects</hi> of our <hi>deſire</hi> and <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LET our warmeſt <hi>Zeal</hi> and our beſt <hi>Actions,</hi> be but quite ſtript of all ſinful ſelfiſh <hi>Reſpects,</hi> and they will be found notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all their gay <hi>Appearances,</hi> to be very <hi>lean</hi> and Jejune; we ſometimes contend for our <hi>Honours</hi> and <hi>Humours,</hi> more than for GOD, (tho we know it not) and that under a Cloak of <hi>Zeal</hi> for him; this is a doleful dreadful <hi>Truth,</hi> which may juſtly humble the <hi>Pride</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> and reaſonably excite us to be as <hi>ſuſpicious</hi> of <hi>ourſelves,</hi> as <hi>cautious</hi> and <hi>moderate</hi> in our <hi>Cenſures</hi> of others: <hi>The Heart of Man is deceitful and deſparately wicked, who can know it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NO doubt thoſe great <hi>Bodies</hi> of religious <hi>People,</hi> that ſo fiercely contended in the <hi>primitive Times,</hi> about <hi>Eaſter-Day;</hi> look'd upon it to be a <hi>Point</hi> of the laſt <hi>Moment,</hi> for they were ſo violent and <hi>furious</hi> upon the <hi>Matter,</hi> that they were deaf to <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,</hi> they would not regard all the ſober <hi>Reaſonings</hi> of pious peaceful <hi>Irenius</hi> and others for <hi>Accommodation,</hi> but with obſtinate and unrelenting <hi>Fury,</hi> proceeded to the dreadful <hi>Sentence</hi> of <hi>Excommunication</hi> againſt each other.</p>

            <p>BUT perhaps ſome may object in this Manner; ſay what you will upon this Head, I won't believe you.</p>
            <p>ANSWER, I do not deſire you to believe me, or take for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what I ſay, without Enquiry; nay, on the contrary, I deſire you not to believe me, or any other Man in that Senſe, <hi>Call no Man Maſter upon Earth:</hi> I only deſire your unprejudiced ſerious <hi>Attention,</hi> to what appears to me upon ſober <hi>Enquiry</hi> to be <hi>ſcriptural</hi> and <hi>rational,</hi> and your Aſſent to it, if upon an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Tryal, it appears ſo to you; and if you will not, it will be your own greateſt Loſs; I cannot pretend to debate the Matter with Men's <hi>Prepoſeſſions</hi> and <hi>Prejudices,</hi> for I know <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> will ſtand no <hi>Chance</hi> in ſuch a <hi>Conteſt;</hi> being both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned before they are heard, ſo far as they relate to the Matter in diſpute!</p>
            <p>WE think it a bad Sign of you, to ſpeak in the Manner you do!</p>
            <p>ANSWER: As to your Cenſures upon me, tho' I hope you mean well in them, yet I muſt tell you, that they do not affect me; becauſe I know you, and all other Men are incompetent <hi>Judges</hi> of ſuch <hi>ſecret Matters:</hi> I may aſſure you, <hi>tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>BUT were my Caſe ſo, as you apprehend, it would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Point it is brought for: Doctrinal <hi>Sentiments</hi> may be <hi>right,</hi> even where the <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Frame</hi> are bad; and <hi>Truth</hi> ſhould be received with readineſs, <hi>reſpect</hi> and <hi>candour,</hi> for GOD'S <hi>ſake,</hi> as well as its <hi>own,</hi> whatever he be that delivers it. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, that <hi>it is not good to have Reſpect of Perſons in Judgment.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> in like Manner aſſures us, that <hi>if we have reſpect of Perſons we ſin, and are convinced of the Law as Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>YOU know you are liable to Miſtakes as well as I am.

original Conſtitution of our <hi>Nature,</hi> which is ſo form'd as to need <hi>Sympathy</hi> and <hi>Succour</hi> from others. What kindneſs we deſire and expect ſhould be ſhewn to us, in our <hi>Diſtreſſes,</hi> let Equity and Humanity incline us to render to others in our turn!</p>
            <p>IT has pleaſed the All-wiſe good GOD, to implant a <hi>Propenſity</hi> in our <hi>Natures</hi> to compaſſionate the <hi>Calamities</hi> of others, which is no ſmall Argument that we ſhould exerciſe it, upon proper <hi>Occaſions;</hi> our <hi>Bowels</hi> yern towards the Miſerable, with a natural <hi>Sympathy,</hi> and we cannot prevent, on our viewing their <hi>Maladies, Sentiments</hi> of <hi>Pity,</hi> without doing <hi>Violence</hi> to ourſelves!

            <p>BLESSED ſays our great Maſter, the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Peace, are the Peace-makers, for they ſhall be called the Children of God.</hi> Such as are deſirous of the <hi>Peace</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> diſpoſed to it, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious to promote it in themſelves and others, by the earneſt Uſe of all proper Means, either to prevent or heal her <hi>Breaches,</hi> which, alas for it, <hi>in many Places are wide as the Sea,</hi> tho' they often meet with ſevere <hi>Cenſures</hi> from Men on both Sides the Queſtion in <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,</hi> yet they will get the <hi>Bleſſing</hi> of God, and <hi>Evidence</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be his genuine Children, who is <hi>eſſentially, exemplarily, declaratively</hi> and <hi>efficiently</hi> LOVE and PEACE.</p>
            <p>WHEN <hi>Peace</hi> prevails, it gives us great advantage to perform the <hi>Office</hi> of a <hi>Friend</hi> by <hi>Inſtruction, Reproof</hi> and <hi>Council,</hi> with the probability of <hi>Succeſs. Love</hi> and <hi>Gentleneſs</hi> diſarm the moſt obſtinate <hi>Prejudice,</hi> and command Attention to what is ſpoken; they eaſily open the obſtructed <hi>avenues</hi> of the <hi>Mind,</hi> and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly unlock the <hi>Springs</hi> of <hi>Affection:</hi> By this, our ſimple but friendly <hi>Addreſſes</hi> ſoftly inſinuate themſelves into the Heart, and conſequently become more powerful and prevalent, than all the <hi>force</hi> of <hi>Argument</hi> and <hi>Charms</hi> of <hi>Rethorick</hi> from the Mouth of an Opponent. We are therefore commanded, to <hi>let our Moderation be known to all Men; to be long ſuffering towards all, and as we have Opportunity to do good unto all; not rendering Evil for Evil; not being Contentious, but Gentle, ſhewing all Meekneſs to all Men. The Miniſters of the Lord muſt not ſtrive, but be gentle to all Men, Patient, in Meekneſs, inſtructing thoſe that oppoſe themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Cloud of Witneſſes with which we are encompaſſed, ſhould incite us <hi>to run with Patience the Race that it ſet before us, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to</hi> JESUS <hi>the Author and Finiſher of our Faith, who endured the Croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame, who endured the Contradiction of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners againſt himſelf, leaſt we be weary and faint in our Minds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN particular, how amiable is the Example of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who <hi>gave no Offence to the Jews or Gentiles, or to the Church of God, who pleaſed all Men in all Things, that they might be ſaved;</hi> who tho' <hi>free from all, yet made himſelf a Servant to all, that he might gain the more to</hi> CHRIST; and for the ſame noble Purpoſe, <hi>became all Things to all Men.</hi>

            <p>THAT the Promiſe aforeſaid does extend to Goſpel Times, appears, as I apprehend, from the following Conſiderations. viz.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. BECAUSE the Completion it had among the <hi>Jews</hi> was but ſmall; there were but few that return'd from the <hi>Babiloniſh Captivity,</hi> in the Time of <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſaith <hi>Junius.</hi>

Lord JESUS CHRIST. <hi>John</hi> xvii. 21. <hi>That all may be one, that they alſo may be</hi> ONE in us, <hi>that the World may believe that thou haſt ſent me, that is, that Strangers to Chriſtianity by behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Love of thoſe that profeſs it, to each other, and</hi> UNION AMONG THEMSELVES, which is the proper Conſequent of it; may be convinced of my divine Miſſion, and induced to receive the Declarations I have made to Men, in purſuance of it; or in other Words, that they may receive my <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND indeed Sirs, as nothing is more amiable, than to ſee <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> who have been broken from one another by <hi>Diviſion,</hi> and prejudiced againſt one another by angry <hi>Debate,</hi> ſeeking the Lord in UNION and Harmony, with ſincere <hi>Sorrow,</hi> ſtrong <hi>Deſires,</hi> humble <hi>Enquiries,</hi> and unfainting <hi>Diligence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SO nothing is more efficacious, to excite Mankind to admire and embrace the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> than the mutual <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Unity</hi> of the Profeſſors of it, by this they know that they are CHRIST'S Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples by this, they ſee a divine <hi>Excellency</hi> in his <hi>Religion;</hi> by this <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> ſpread ſo far and ſo faſt, in the firſt Ages of it, this made the <hi>Heathens</hi> admiring ſay (in the Time of <hi>Tertullian</hi>) how do the Chriſtians love one another. This as eaſily as ſpeedily with a gentle Violence triumph'd over the unreaſonable <hi>Prejudices</hi> of the moſt obſtinate <hi>Infidels</hi> of every <hi>Nation, Age, Order, Sex,</hi> and <hi>Character,</hi> and conquered <hi>Kingdoms</hi> to the <hi>Faith</hi> of CHRIST.</p>
            <p>BUT the contrary is a dreadful Stumbling-block, that Prejudices the <hi>Jews, Turks,</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> againſt the Religion of JESUS; and makes divers even in Chriſtian Countries queſtion its divine <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOR can its ableſt <hi>Advocates,</hi> by all their learned <hi>Apologies,</hi> do it ſo much Service as this does Injury! For every new <hi>Schiſm</hi> in the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> weakens it, and is uſed as a new <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> againſt the whole of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and tho' unjuſtly, yet really pours <hi>Contempt</hi> upon it. O, if <hi>zealous</hi> Men of narrow Minds, would but conſider this, they would tremble at the Thoughts of <hi>Breaches</hi> and <hi>Schiſms</hi> in the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> and on the contrary, pray and ſtrive, in the earneſt Uſe of all appointed Means, <hi>that as there is but one Shepherd, ſo there may be but one Sheep-fold,</hi> (John x. 16.) (<hi>Mia poimne eis poimen</hi>) there is an Elegancy in the Original, the copulative <hi>And</hi> is not in it, as in our Verſion; the Words are theſe, <hi>one Sheepfold, one Shepherd,</hi> viz. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, one Church</hi> of all Chriſtians, gathered under and united to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as their <hi>Head; one People</hi> of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the <hi>Partition-Wall</hi> being removed, (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> ii. 14.) the Meaning is, to <hi>one Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd one Flock</hi> belongs; as I am therefore one <hi>Paſtor,</hi> ſo my SHEEP-FOLD ſhall be ONE.<note n="*" place="bottom">So Grotius and Luodovicus de diu.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I ſay, when all theſe Things are conſidered complexly, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the broken divided State of the Chriſtian <hi>Church</hi> at preſent, they plainly ſhew that the aforeſaid Scripture, <hi>Jer.</hi> l. 4, 5.
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:006423_0117_1028DFF04AB28680"/>
extends to the <hi>Goſpel-Church,</hi> (ſo <hi>Calvin, Pool,</hi> and <hi>Henery</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it.) and that as yet it has not had a full Accompliſhment, and therefore it is a great Encouragement, to pray and ſtrive for the Bleſſing contained in it.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER remarkable <hi>Promiſe,</hi> we have in <hi>Ezek.</hi> xxxvii 19. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, behold I will take the Stick of</hi> Joſeph, <hi>which is in the Hand of</hi> Ephraim, <hi>and the Tribes of</hi> Iſrael <hi>his Fellows, and will put them with him even with the Stick of</hi> Judah, <hi>and make them one Stick, and they ſhall become one in my Hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THERE had been a <hi>Breach</hi> of <hi>Union,</hi> and unhappy <hi>Animoſities</hi> conſequent thereupon, between the two Kingdoms of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> who were <hi>Bretbren,</hi> and but <hi>one Kingdom</hi> before the fatal <hi>Breach,</hi> after which upon all Occaſions, <hi>Ephraim envied Judah,</hi> and on the other Hand <hi>Judah vexed Ephraim:</hi> But here it is promiſed, that that divided State, which was ſo uncomfortable to, and unſafe for both, ſhould continue no longer, but that there ſhould be a happy, a comfortable <hi>Coalition</hi> between them, diſpoſing them to bury former <hi>Offences,</hi> and angry Contentions in the <hi>Grave</hi> of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual <hi>Oblivion,</hi> and for the future only contend who ſhould <hi>love</hi> one another moſt, and excel in the <hi>humble</hi> but amiable <hi>Offices</hi> of mutual <hi>Kindneſs</hi> and <hi>Endearment!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THEY had been two STICKS oppoſing and hurting one another but now they ſhall become ONE, ſupporting and ſtrengthening each other, and unitedly under GOD, promoting the ſame good <hi>Cauſe</hi> and <hi>Deſign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW altho' this Promiſe, has a primary and direct Referrence to the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet undoubtedly it extends farther, even to the <hi>Union</hi> of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> into one <hi>Church,</hi> under the <hi>Goſpel-Oeconomy;</hi> profeſſing one <hi>Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm,</hi> and is very applicable to a <hi>re-union</hi> of <hi>Brethren,</hi> of the ſame <hi>Sentiments</hi> into one <hi>Body</hi> or religious <hi>Community.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>UNCHARITAPLE <hi>Diviſions</hi> and Separations on account of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantials, or leſſer Things (not impos'd) among thoſe that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the ſame <hi>fundamentals</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> is a crimſon Iniquity, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with moſt awful Aggravations!</p>
            <p>THEY are exceeding contrary to the very <hi>Nature</hi> of GOD, who is Love, as has been before obſerved: <hi>Love</hi> is the Perfection of all Grace, the End of all Duties, the moſt excellent Way, the Work of Heaven, the new Commandment, the Imitation of the beſt of Beings, and a principal mean to obtain and maintain a Communion with him. <hi>He that loves, dwells in God, and God in him, for God is Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>UNCHARITABLE <hi>Diviſions</hi> are exceeding contrary to the whole <hi>Law</hi> and Word of GOD, which is fufill'd by <hi>Love,</hi> and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to that expreſs <hi>Precept</hi> which enjoins us to <hi>keep the</hi> Unity <hi>of the</hi> Spirit, <hi>in the Bond of</hi> Peace.</p>
            <p>NOR are they leſs contrary to the whole <hi>Goſpel</hi> of GOD, which is a moſt aſtoniſhing Diſplay of the divine <hi>Love</hi> and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in all it's Glory, Riches, Charms, and Condeſcenſions, and
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:006423_0118_1028DFF36DCCE638"/>
therefore contains the ſtrongeſt <hi>Incentives</hi> to <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Unity,</hi> all which are thereby oppos'd. But</p>
            <p>UNCHARITABLE <hi>Diviſions</hi> are not only contrary to the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of GOD, the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the Goſpel of <hi>God,</hi> but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to the <hi>Chriſt</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> they ſtain his <hi>Honour,</hi> and oppoſe his <hi>Deſign</hi> in our <hi>Redemption;</hi> making many <hi>Bodies,</hi> looks like a Diſpoſition to have have many <hi>Heads,</hi> and ſo either to renounce CHRIST, or divide him (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 13.) it is an Attempt to make CHRIST himſelf a <hi>Sectarian,</hi> or a Ringleader of a Sect; which is a vile Affront; CHRIST is the common Head of Chriſtians, but he is not, he cannot be the Head of Parties and Factions, as ſuch: Beſides ſuch Diviſions repreſent the dear <hi>Redeemer</hi> as an impotent <hi>Prince</hi> that cannot keep his <hi>Kingdom</hi> in <hi>Unity,</hi> or communicate, a ſuitable and ſufficient <hi>Syſtem</hi> of Doctrines and Laws of this Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency; the ſcandalous Behaviour of his Subjects is caſt upon <hi>Zy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>'s King, his Laws, and the Conſtitution of his Government: For the <hi>Deſign</hi> of the holy JESUS in our <hi>Redemption,</hi> was to reconcile all that believe, to GOD, to unite and center them all in him, <hi>to gather together in one, the Children of GOD, that are ſcattered abroad, to make in himſelf of twain, one new Man, ſo making Peace.</hi> (See John xi. 52. Epheſ. ii. 15.) Farther,</p>
            <p>UNCHARITABLE Diviſions are exceeding contrary to the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Work</hi> of GOD. They oppoſe the Work of God the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in our own Souls, and in the Souls of others, in its Nature, Deſign, and Tendency. <hi>By one Spirit,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>we are all baptized into one Body, whether</hi> Jew <hi>or</hi> Gentile, <hi>bond or free; and have all been made to drink into one Spirit.</hi> (1 Cor. xii. 13.) The Nature and Tendency of the <hi>Work</hi> of the bleſſed Spirit of God, in our own and others Souls, is <hi>Love, Peace, Unity:</hi> And hence the two former are called the <hi>Fruits of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> (Gal. v. 22.) and the latter is called the <hi>Unity of the Spirit,</hi> (Epheſ. iv. 24) And the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>taught of God to love one another,</hi> (1 Theſſ. iv. 9.) Hence you may ſee, that thoſe who promote uncharitable <hi>Diviſions,</hi> oppoſe (tho' not with Deſign) not only the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, but likewiſe the <hi>Work</hi> of GOD in their own Souls, and in the Souls of others: By pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking their angry Reſentments ſinfully, they fight againſt the Nature, Spirit and Genius of Converſion to God, and real Chriſtianity. Again,</p>
            <p>UNCHARITABLE <hi>Diviſions</hi> are exceeding contrary to the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances</hi> of GOD, viz. <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> the Word preach'd, and the LORD'S <hi>Supper,</hi> the Deſign of which is to procure and preſerve the <hi>Unity</hi> of his <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BY <hi>Baptiſm</hi> Perſons are added to the Church (Acts ii. and 1 Cor, xii. 12, 13.) <hi>For as the Body is one and hath many Members, and all the Members of that one Body; ſo alſo is</hi> CHTIST; that is, <hi>Chriſt Miſtical,</hi> or the viſible Church which is his Body: The Reaſon of which <hi>Union</hi> in the Church of CHRIST, or <hi>mean</hi> to procure it is <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> for ſaith the Apoſtle, by one <hi>Spirit</hi> we are all <hi>Baptized</hi>
               <pb n="112" facs="unknown:006423_0119_1028DFF685724980"/>
into one <hi>Body;</hi> i. e. The deſign of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is not only as a <hi>Sign</hi> to repreſent, a <hi>mean</hi> to obtain the aforeſaid <hi>Union;</hi> but likewiſe as a ſolemn <hi>Bond</hi> of Engagement upon us to promote and preſerve it, by all proper Endeavours, without which we are not like to have the <hi>Anſwer of a good Conſcience,</hi> in performing the <hi>Vows</hi> and anſwering the <hi>End</hi> of that gracious <hi>Inſtitution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND does not <hi>faith come by hearing, and hearing by the Word of GOD? Which we cant hear,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>without a Preacher;</hi> even that faith which unites to CHRIST our Head, and works by Love to his Members our Brethren. Moreover,</p>
            <p>BY the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> as the inſpired writer obſerves, <hi>we are one Bread, and one Body, tho' we be many, for we are all partakers of that one Bread,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> x. 17.) i. e. We declare that we are but one <hi>Body</hi> Miſtical, by our joynt Communicating at the LORD'S Supper, of one <hi>Bread,</hi> or one <hi>Loaf,</hi> which is made up of many Grains, and as we declare the aforeſaid <hi>Unity,</hi> ſo by partaking of this confirming <hi>Seal</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> we renew and confirm, our ſolemn <hi>Obligations</hi> entered into by <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> to do all that in us lies, to procure and preſerve that <hi>Unity:</hi> Which repeated En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements if it be not a great Evil to violate, I know not what is.</p>
            <p>NOR are the aforeſaid <hi>Diviſions</hi> leſs contrary, to the Deſign of the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of GOD, the Diſpenſers of the Word and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; which is the <hi>edifying of the Body</hi> of CHRIST; not tearing into Parts the one <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and making many of it, No! but building of it up, as the Word ſignifies, by bringing new Members to it, and ſtrengthening thoſe that are brought in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THE Words of our dear <hi>Redeemer</hi> to this Purpoſe, ſhould not be lightly paſſed over, <hi>Mat.</hi> xii. 25. <hi>Every Kingdom divided againſt itſelf, is brought to Deſolation, and ever City, or Houſe, divided againſt itſelf, ſhall not ſtand,</hi> that is, every <hi>Kingdom</hi> tho' large and ſtrong, yet if divided into various <hi>Factions,</hi> is like to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown. (thus <hi>Beza, Camero,</hi>) It was a common Saying among the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> like that of <hi>Saluſt, Concordia res parve creſcunt, diſcordia maxime dilabuntur,</hi> i. e. by Concord ſmall Things encreaſe, but by Diſcord great are deſtroy'd. Or of <hi>Cicero, Que domus, tam ſtabilis, que tam firma civitas eſt, que non odiis, atque diſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diis, funditus, poſſit everti,</hi> i. e. what Houſe is ſo ſtable, what City ſo ſtrong and impregnable, as cannot be entirely overthrown, by Hatred and Diſcord?</p>
            <p>OUR Lord inſinuates, by applying the aforeſaid <hi>Proverb</hi> to the Occaſion, upon which it was ſpoken, that <hi>Satan</hi> had more Saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, than to attempt to promote his Kingdom by <hi>Diviſion;</hi> and may we not learn <hi>Prudence</hi> from an Enemy, <hi>Certe fas eſt et, ab hoſte doceri.</hi>

            <p>IN Confirmation of which the Words of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians</hi> chap v. ver. 15. are remarkable, <hi>but if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed one of another,</hi> i. e. beware that you do not wound or tear one another, by Words pointed with Envy and Calumny, and by injurious Deeds; leaſt the Iſſue thereof ſhould terminate in your mutual Overthrow, and final Ruin! leaſt that GOD who <hi>is a conſuming Fire,</hi> ſhould be provoked by your <hi>Impiety</hi> to ſend deſolating <hi>Calamities</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>AND hence the Apoſtle obſerves, in the 14th, 16th, 17th, and 20th Verſes of the ſame Chapter, that the whole Will of GOD, containing our Duty towards Men, is reducible to this one thing LOVE; for whatever the Almighty requires towards them, is but a Branch from this Root, a Stream from this <hi>Fountain; The End of the Commandment, is Charity out of a pure Heart, and Faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned:</hi> The contrary to which, <hi>viz.

            </p>
            <p>AND obſerve that one of thoſe <hi>Works</hi> of the <hi>Fleſh</hi> is SEDITION, <hi>(dichoſtaſiai, a diſtemi diſto, ſejungo, diſſention diſſidium)</hi> Diſſention, Diſcord; the ſame that is elſewhere called <hi>Diviſion,</hi> and SCHISM, conſiſting in an uncharitable Alienation of Mind, among thoſe that profeſs the ſame <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> on Account of <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial</hi> Differences of Opinion; often breaking the external <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of CHRIST, and dividing it into Parties, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low different Leaders, whoſe Perſons they have in Admiration: One ſaying he is of <hi>Paul;</hi> another he is of <hi>Apollos;</hi> another of <hi>Cephas;</hi> and another of CHRIST.

            <p>AND yet that which makes this horrible <hi>Iniquity</hi> the more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous and fatal, is that it is ſeldom repented of, nay, it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly juſtified by thoſe that commit it, and contended for, as an Inſtance of <hi>Spirituality,</hi> an important <hi>Duty,</hi> and a proper <hi>Mean</hi> to promote CHRIST'S <hi>Kingdom.</hi> It's true it may be <hi>Spiritual,</hi> but then it is not from the <hi>Spirit</hi> of GOD, but as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> obſerves, the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Devil;</hi> and to try to promote CHRIST'S Kingdom thereby, is juſt as prudent, as to cut off our <hi>Legs</hi> in

order to quicken our Motion; or pluck out our <hi>Heart</hi> or <hi>Bowels</hi> to promote our <hi>Health!</hi> It is eaſy to convince People of the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of <hi>Swearing,</hi> or <hi>Drunkenneſs,</hi> but it is difficult to convince them of this, which is perhaps as much ſpoken againſt by the bleſſed GOD, as any Sin in the <hi>Bible;</hi> nay, ſome, inſtead of ſeeing Evil in it, father the <hi>Abomination</hi> upon GOD himſelf, which is horrible <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> tho' undeſign'd!</p>
            <p>AND that which tends to confirm Perſons in this unhappy Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, is the <hi>Piety</hi> of ſome that are guilty of it, but we ſhould learn to diſtinguiſh between <hi>Perſons</hi> and their <hi>Actions;</hi> and to love the one, while we ſometimes reaſonably hate the other: The Goodneſs of none can either <hi>juſtify,</hi> or <hi>protect</hi> our <hi>Imitation</hi> of them in what is bad; all Men are <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And to ſpeak Evil of ſuch as cannot run with them to the ſame Exceſs of Rïot!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT the aforeſaid uncharitable <hi>Diviſions,</hi> are not only exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary to the <hi>Credit, Comfort, Proſperity</hi> and <hi>Safety</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of GOD, but likewiſe to all the dear and honourable <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> we ſuſtain to GOD, and one another: <hi>We are all</hi> (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly) <hi>the Children of GOD, by Faith in</hi> Jeſus Chriſt.

            <p>TO ſuppoſe that it intends a <hi>ſeperation</hi> from the viſible <hi>Church,</hi> upon the Account of <hi>Circumſtantials</hi> not impos'd, is in effect to ſay, that Almighty God commands poſitive Contradictions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he elſewhere enjoins ſuch to receive each other and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Gloſs muſt needs be falſe from which ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction flows.</p>
            <p>IT is true if any Church impoſes <hi>Circumſtantials</hi> upon us, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Conſciences, as <hi>Terms</hi> of <hi>Communion,</hi> we muſt obey God rather than Man, in forbearing to communicate with them: and if divine Providence offers an Opportunity of enjoying re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Privileges, without ſuch Impoſitions, no doubt we may peaceably and charitably withdraw and embrace it: This is far
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:006423_0125_1028E3AD7525E560"/>
from <hi>Schiſm,</hi> which chiefly conſiſts in an <hi>uncharitable Allienation of Mind from our Brethren:</hi> And hence the Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>Schiſms</hi> among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who met at the ſame Sacramental Table. <hi>Chillingworth, Hales,</hi> and Dr. <hi>H. More</hi> have juſtly aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <q>That if the <hi>Pope</hi> had impoſed but one <hi>lye</hi> to be ſubſcribed, or one <hi>Sin</hi> to be done, and ſaid all Nations and Perſons that do not this, are no Chriſtians, or ſhall have no <hi>Communion</hi> with the Church: The Man that refuſeth that impoſed <hi>Lye</hi> or <hi>Sin,</hi> is guiltleſs of the <hi>Schiſm,</hi> and doth but obey God and ſave his Soul; and the <hi>Uſurperer</hi> that <hi>impoſeth</hi> them will be found the henious <hi>ſchiſmatick</hi> before God, and the Cauſe of all theſe <hi>Diviſions</hi> of the Church.</q>
            </p>
            <p>SOME draw an Objection againſt <hi>Union</hi> from theſe Words of GOD to the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> (chap. xv. 19, 20.) <hi>Let them return unto thee, but return not thou unto them, and I will make thee unto this People a fenced brazen Wall, and they ſhall fight againſt thee, but they ſhall not prevail againſt thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ANSWER, I think Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> gives us the true meaning of the aforeſaid Place of Scripture, in theſe Words, <q>He chargeth the Prophet to keep his ground and not to go over unto wicked Men, but to uſe his endeavour to reduce them to that Obedience he yielded to him,</q> Do not flatter them or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to their Evil Practice, but labour to reclaim them and bring them under the Yoke of God, declare faithfully what I have commanded thee; to this Effect ſpeak <hi>Calvin, Junius</hi> and <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</hi> So that what is forbidden, is a criminal Neglect of Duty, a criminal Compliance with, or conformity to what is <hi>Evil;</hi> but to ſeek <hi>Peace</hi> with, and <hi>Union</hi> to our Brethren, who hold the ſame Foundation Principles, and are regular in Life, is ſo far from being Evil, that it is poſitively commanded: Hence it appears, that the Text aforeſaid, is foreign to the Point for which it is aduced. To take the aforeſaid Scripture in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Senſe than I have given of it, makes it contradict many poſitive divine Precepts, which enjoin us to <hi>enſue Peace, to leave our Gift at the Altar, and go firſt and be reconciled to our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> and therefore any other Senſe of the Text cannot be true, for GOD cannot command Contradictions.</p>
            <p>IN reading the late <hi>Chriſtian Hiſtory,</hi> compoſed by Mr. <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Boſton,</hi> I could not but obſerve in the Accounts he gives of many Reverend Miniſters of <hi>New-England,</hi> who favour'd the late revival of Religion, that notwithſtanding of their <hi>Zeal</hi> for that bleſſed Work of the moſt high God, they ſtill retained charitable Sentiments of their Brethren, who differed from them in Opinion upon that Head, and ſpoke honourably of them: This is an Example well worthy of our Imitation, which may it pleaſe the God of Peace and Love, to encline and enable us all to conform to.</p>
            <p>OBJECTION, But <hi>we muſt not partake of other Men's Sins,</hi> (1 Tim. v. 22.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Anſwer,</hi> It is very true, we muſt not partake of them by
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:006423_0126_1028E3AF539EA4E0"/>
               <hi>Conſent,</hi> either <hi>negatively,</hi> by neglecting any Duty incumbent on us for the Prevention or Cure thereof; or <hi>poſitively</hi> encouraging it by our <hi>Council</hi> or <hi>Example,</hi> but when you have done all that is your Part to oppoſe and prevent it, the Sin is not yours.</p>
            <p>TO ſuppoſe that your <hi>Preſence</hi> or <hi>joining</hi> in publick <hi>Ordinances,</hi> makes you <hi>Guilty</hi> without your <hi>Conſent,</hi> is ridiculous Nonſenſe: For at this Rate, as was hinted before, all ſocial Worſhip muſt be deſtroy'd. For if by joining in Communion with them in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ordinances, we are, contrary to our <hi>Conſent,</hi> made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of one Sin of our Brother, why not of all his Sins, by the ſame Rule? And if of his, why not of every other Man's that we join in Worſhip with? It is abſurd to imagine with ſome Ignorant, tho' well meaning People, that we partake of this Guilt at the <hi>Sacrament</hi> only, for we join in religious Worſhip with them in other Parts of it, ſuch as <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Praiſes,</hi> as really as there; and therefore the aforeſaid Gloſs will make us guilty of all the Sins of every one that we join with in Worſhip, either in our Families or publick Aſſemblies. And if the Caſe be ſo, Reaſon will teach us, to avoid with great Care, all private and publick <hi>Worſhip,</hi> for the ſake of our <hi>Safety,</hi> to prevent our Ruin and Damnation; and yet the Almighty enjoins both, to promote our Benefit and Salvation.</p>
            <p>Now how can theſe Things conſiſt together? Can it be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably ſuppos'd, that an all-wiſe and gracious GOD would, in order to promote our good, enjoin us to uſe any Method which would bring upon us the <hi>Guilt</hi> of inumerable Tranſgreſſions? By the aforeſaid Objection, conſidered in its juſt and natural Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, all private and publick Worſhip are entirely overthrown; becauſe all Men that we do, or can aſſociate with in this World, are imperfect Creatures, guilty of Multitudes of Sins, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it becomes ours, on our worſhiping <hi>Jehovah</hi> with them, according to his Command; and therefore it does not only deſtroy private and publick Worſhip altogether, but caſts baſe <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> upon the bleſſed GOD, as if he was an Enemy to his Creatures as ſuch, and enjoined a Religion upon them that tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed directly to promote their eternal Damnation, and that under the Pretext of Kindneſs and Love! But where is the Senſe of our being <hi>Guilty</hi> of the Sins that we never conſented to either vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually or actually?</p>
            <p>BUT pray obſerve, that God is not only blaſphemed by the aforeſaid <hi>Objection,</hi> and all <hi>private</hi> and <hi>publick Worſhip</hi> overthrown but likewiſe all Church <hi>Government</hi> is entirely unhing'd; for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>under the ubrage of it, every one that is Ignorant enough, and inclin'd to be a <hi>proud Separatiſt,</hi> (the Character of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> of old) may according to their humour pretend <hi>Diſſatisfaction</hi> with ſome <hi>circumſtantials</hi> in <hi>Principle,</hi> or <hi>fault</hi> in <hi>Practice,</hi> either in the Miniſter or ſome of the Communicants, where they were wont to join, and ſo pack of abruptly as the fit takes them, agreeable to the wild flights of their ungovernable <hi>Fancy:</hi> According to this

               <hi>Plan</hi> every Member of the Body takes upon himſelf, without any Authority, the <hi>Government</hi> of the whole, the <hi>Rule</hi> of which is <hi>humour</hi> and <hi>caprice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SURELY if People were more watchful over their own Hearts and Ways, they would have leſs of the <hi>leaven</hi> of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> that is, of their <hi>proud ſeparating Diſpoſition</hi> from others, leſs of their <hi>Sowerneſs</hi> and <hi>Severity</hi> in cenſuring of others, for not <hi>Tything Mint</hi> and <hi>Annis</hi> and <hi>Cummin,</hi> for not being ſo good as they are forſooth, or even fit to converſe with them. Hear how the Almighty ſpeaks of ſuch, (Iſa. lxv. 2, 3, 5.) <hi>I have ſpread out my Hands all the Day, unto a rebellious People, which walketh in a way that was not good, after their own Thoughts; a People that provoketh me to anger continually to my Face; which ſay ſtand by thyſelf, come not near to me, for I am holier than thou: Thoſe are a ſmoke in my Noſe, a fire that burneth all the Day.</hi>

            <p>UPON which Mr. <hi>Henry</hi> gloſſeth juſtly as follows, <q>The moſt provoking Iniquity of the <hi>Jews,</hi> in our Saviour's Time, was their <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Hypocriſy,</hi> that Sin of the Scribes and Phariſees, againſt which CHRIST denounceth ſo many Woes. They ſay, ſtand by thy ſelf, keep off, get thee to thine, ſo the original is, keep to thine own Companions, but come not near to me, leaſt thou pollute me; touch me not, I will not allow thee any familiarity with me, for I am holier than thou, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou art not good enough to converſe with me, <hi>I am not at other Men, nor even as this Publican.</hi> They thought themſelves holier than any, better than any of their Neighbours.

            <p>THERE were many Corruptions in the Churches at <hi>Corinth, Galatia</hi> and <hi>Laodocea,</hi> but we read of no Command to ſeparate from them on account thereof.</p>
            <p>GIVE me leave to conſider one <hi>Objection</hi> more, which is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That our Brethren of the preſent <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> have oppos'd the <hi>whole</hi> of the late <hi>Work of God</hi> in this Land, and aſcribed it to the <hi>Devil;</hi> in ſupport of which, theſe Things follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are alledg'd, viz.</p>
            <p>A Satyrical <hi>Lampoon,</hi> entitled, <hi>the Wandering Spirit.</hi> But ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Peice was Anonymous, (had no Name affix'd to it) and was never own'd by our Brethren, <hi>as a Body,</hi> it cannot, without manifeſt Injuſtice, be aſcrib'd to them, as ſuch; nor is there any certain or ſufficient Proof, that ever it was own'd and approv'd of (in all its Parts) by any one of them, ſo far as I know: And if there was, it can't affect the whole, unleſs the like Proof can be offered againſt them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="unknown:006423_0128_1028E3B7ED0A0F50"/>AGAIN, The <hi>Queriſts</hi> are produc'd as another Proof, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Charge; to which it may be reply'd, That not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding of ſome ſlighty Repreſentations of the late religious Commotions, interſpers'd in ſome Paſſages of thoſe Writings; yet I know not that they aſſign any of them, and much leſs all of them, to the <hi>Devil:</hi> Moreover it ſhould be conſidered, that theſe Books were <hi>Anonymus,</hi> and never approv'd by the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> by any authoritative judicial Act, nor, ſo far as I know, by any of their inferior Judicatures, as ſuch, and therefore cannot be juſtly charged upon that <hi>Body</hi> as their Act and Deed.</p>
            <p>BUT the following Paragraph of the <hi>Proteſt,</hi> page 11. is tho't by ſome to be a ſufficient Evidence of the Charge. The Words are theſe <q>6. Their preaching the Terrors of the Law in ſuch Manner and Dialect as has no precedent in the Word of God, but rather appears to be borrow'd from a worſe Dialect, and ſo induſtriouſly working on the Paſſions and Affections of weak Minds, ſo as to cauſe them to cry out in a hideous Manner, and fall down in Convulſion-like Fits, to the marring of the profiting both of themſelves and others, who are ſo taken up in ſeeing and hearing theſe odd Symptoms, that they cannot attend to, or hear what the Preacher ſays; and then after all, boaſting of theſe Things as the <hi>Work of God,</hi> which we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded do proceed from an inferior or worſe Cauſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The inſufficiency of this Evidence, may be plainly perceived by conſidering, that it is only ſome exceptionable particulars that are oppos'd in the preceeding Paragraph, <hi>viz.</hi> an unſcriptural <hi>Mode</hi> of <hi>preaching</hi> the <hi>Terrors</hi> of the Law, an induſtrious <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> on the <hi>Paſſions</hi> of <hi>weak Minds,</hi> cauſing hideous <hi>out cries,</hi> and <hi>falling down</hi> in Convulſion-like Fits, and <hi>boaſting</hi> of theſe Things as the <hi>Work of God.</hi> Now are any of theſe Things a Part, or all of them together, the <hi>Work of God</hi> we have been contending for, or any Part of it, any neceſſary Apendage of it, or any Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it? If we ſay Yea, we ourſelves brand the <hi>Work of God</hi> with Scandal and Ridicule, if nay, then theſe Things come from an inferior or worſe <hi>Cauſe.</hi> Pray is not Nature, a Cauſe inferior to GOD, and worſe then him? And does not <hi>Charity</hi> oblige us, to put the moſt mild Conſtruction upon others Words, that they can in Reaſon bear? The Senſe I have given of the Words, is eaſy and natural, but the other is a Force upon them; pray does it not look more like the ſtrength of Prejudice then Argument, to turn Particulars into Generals or Univerſals, and put the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Interpretation upon Words, that they can poſſibly bear. The Words of the Paragragph are particular and limited, <hi>boaſting of</hi> THESE THINGS, <hi>as the work of GOD,</hi> if any were Guilty hereof, (as doubtleſs our Brethren were ſo inform'd) they were to be pitied for their Weakneſs, and if any of the younger Miniſters, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudently aggravated to an exceſſive pitch, the Paſſions of the diſreſs'd, by an unſcriptural or unſeaſonable Inculcation of Terrors, (at any Time) it was certainly very wrong; but whether there was
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:006423_0129_1028E3BC00AF6A40"/>
any Foundation for this Charge, in any Degree, it is not my Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at preſent to Inquire?</p>
            <p>IN a Word, whatever unadviſed Expreſſions, in private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, might poſſibly drop from the <hi>Lips</hi> of ſome of our <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> in a heat of <hi>Paſſion,</hi> or <hi>ferment</hi> of <hi>Diſpute,</hi> (in diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Work of GOD) many Years agone, which Methinks it is now high Time to forget, yet upon Enquiry I cannot find any UNITED TESTIMONY of their BODY upon <hi>Record</hi> againſt the late REVIVAL of RELIGION, (truly ſo called) not one by which they deny the <hi>Reality</hi> of it, and far leſs aſcribe it to the <hi>Devil.</hi> Now whither it is Reaſonable or Charitable, for any to ſuffer their Minds to be inflamed with prejudice againſt their Brethren, by unprov'd reports, judge ye? It never was, nor I believe ever can or will be prov'd, againſt the preſent Synod of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> That they have generally, univerſally, or as a Body aſcrib'd the late <hi>revival</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> (truly and properly ſo call'd) to the <hi>Devil,</hi> and therefore however Pious our Deſigns are, it is no Act of <hi>Friendſhip</hi> to <hi>Truth,</hi> to <hi>Juſtice,</hi> to <hi>Charity,</hi> or to the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Weal</hi> of CHRIST'S viſible <hi>Kingdom,</hi> to receive or ſpread ſuch Charges, as directly tend to create, encreaſe, and confirm <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices,</hi> and enflame reſentments againſt our <hi>Brethren,</hi> widen the <hi>Breaches</hi> of <hi>Zyon</hi> as the Sea, and make her <hi>Wounds</hi> Bleed a freſh, and reject a Remedy: May GOD in Mercy to his poor Church, Pardon and Reform ſuch unaccountable Conduct!</p>
            <p>PRAY may not an Acknowledgement be as reaſonably deſir'd of us, for LICENCING and ORDAINING contrary to the Act of the Synod, as we can deſire an Acknowledgement, upon the Account of the PROTEST? But can we make ſuch an Acknowledgment? No! for whither we did right or wrong in Licencing &amp;c. we did it in the integrity of our Hearts, as believing it to be our Duty; &amp; if we wou'd exerciſe the ſame Charity towards our Brethren, as we deſire to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ourſelves, in this Caſe, wou'd no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And thus by inſiſting on Acknowledgments, the way to Union is as effectually, as uncharitably, unſcripturally, and unreaſonably ſhut up, without any probability of an Alteration; and is not this a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable Caſe? Surely it is!</p>
            <p>NOW in order to avoid uncharitable <hi>Diviſions,</hi> and <hi>Tumults;</hi> it is neceſſary to beware of <hi>Pride;</hi> for as <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerves, <hi>It is only by Pride that Contention comes,</hi> (Prov. xiii. 10.) And elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where he declareth, that <hi>a proud Spirit ſtirreth up Strife;</hi> this makes Men eaſy to be provok'd, and hard to be reconciled, the proud Man is always aiming at ſome higher Mark of Honour:
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:006423_0130_1028E3BD8E78E520"/>
and if Peace and Union won't anſwer that, War and Diviſion ſhall; what elſe but Ambition made War in Heaven itſelf? Pride inclines us to obtrude with Violence our Opinion even in leſſer Things upon others, and unjuſtly deny them the Liberty we deſire for our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And therefore we are told, that the Overſeer or Paſtor of a particular <hi>Flock,</hi> or Biſhop ſhould be no <hi>Novice, leaſt being lifted up, or puffed up with Pride, he fall into the Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Devil.</hi> (1 Tim. iii. 6.) it was doubtleſs upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Pride,</hi> that the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> complains of <hi>Diotrep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>O, how precious and amiable is this Grace, in the eſteem of GOD and good Men!

In a Word, ſuch <hi>Men</hi> if they may be call'd ſo; (ſeeing they bid defiance to the Sentiments of <hi>Humanity,</hi>) like brute <hi>Beaſts</hi> ſpeak Evil of what they underſtand not, publiſh their own <hi>ſhame,</hi> and inſtead of expoſing others, do contrary to their <hi>Deſign,</hi> (in Effect) pronounce a <hi>Panegyrick</hi> upon them, and a juſt <hi>Satire</hi> upon themſelves!</p>
            <p>ON the Contrary, dear Sirs, let us with ſincerity, ſpeed and ſteadfaſtneſs, comply with the poſitive <hi>Means</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Union</hi> before hinted. O! let us entertain kind Thoughts of the Speech and Actions of our Brethren. Dr. H. <hi>More</hi> obſerves juſtly, <q>That it would do much more good in the World, if all Parties inſtead of ſevere Cenſure, were ready to find out and commend what is good in the Doctrine and Worſhip of thoſe that differ from them; that this would encline them to liſten to advice for Reformation, and keep up the Credit of the common <hi>Truths</hi> and <hi>Duties</hi> of Religion; when this envious ſnarling at all that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do, tends to bring Mankind to <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> and baniſh all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of <hi>Religion,</hi> together with Chriſtian <hi>Charity,</hi> from the Earth.</q>

               <pb n="127" facs="unknown:006423_0134_1028E3CBBB4E6F20"/>DID not our LORD uſe this Method when he reproved the Churches of <hi>Epheſus, Pergamos</hi> and <hi>Thyatyra?</hi> to ſoften their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Obſtinacy and Reluctance againſt <hi>Reproof,</hi> and to make it efficacious to anſwer its Deſign: The bleſſed JESUS introduced it with a <hi>Commendation</hi> of what was Praiſe worthy in them, (Rev. ii.) This is an <hi>Example</hi> truly rational, and well worthy of Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>O! let us not believe every bad Story we hear of our <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. Scultetus</hi> (from <hi>Toſſanus</hi>) relates this Paſſage of Prince <hi>Frederick</hi> of <hi>Montpelgard,</hi> who had been prejudiced againſt the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> by a <hi>Papal Tuition,</hi> that when he was at <hi>Geneva</hi> and <hi>Helvetia,</hi> he was wont to ſay, <q>Geneve et in Helvetia, vidi mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, de quibus, nihil, pauca eorum de quibus ſepe audivi.</q> 
               <hi>i. e.</hi> At <hi>Geneva</hi> and <hi>Helvetia,</hi> I have ſeen many Things of which I heard nothing before, and few of thoſe Things which I have often heard of. It was likewiſe a juſt and generous ſaying of Lord <hi>Verulam,</hi> in his <hi>Eſſays,</hi> worthy of a good Mind, <q>That the GOD above, who knoweth the Heart, doth diſcern, that frail Men in ſome of their Contradictions, intend the ſame Thing, and accepteth both.</q> This is in Subſtance the ſame with the Apoſtles truly Catholick <hi>Sentiments</hi> expreſſed in the <hi>fourteenth</hi> Chapter of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter exceeding neceſſary to be well underſtood, and ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered at this Juncture.</p>
            <p>IF we would but defend an accuſed <hi>Brother</hi> in his abſence, as far as Reaſon directs, as far as we would deſire him to defend us in the like Circumſtances, and be hardly induced to believe what is bad of them; and even when we are conſtrained to it by ſufficient and credible Evidence, to yield an unwilling aſſent; and in the mean time to impute the faulty <hi>Sentiment,</hi> the criminal <hi>Conduct</hi> to good Deſign, or to Ignorance, Overſight and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, rather than <hi>Malignity,</hi> as far as we reaſonably can, it would probably have a happy Influence to promote <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Union.</hi> And</p>
            <p>FARTHER, if to kind Thoughts, we add <hi>candid courteous Speech,</hi> and <hi>friendly Behaviour</hi> and <hi>Action,</hi> it will crown the Scene, ſoften their Prejudices, invite mutual Reſpect, from all that are not entirely loſt to a Senſe of Ingenuity and Gratitude, and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Union</hi> where they are, and at leaſt prepare the Way for them where they are not.

this Account, that our dear Saviour and his Apoſtles, have ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quently inculcated the great Duties of mutual <hi>Forbearance, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience</hi> and <hi>Love;</hi> which we would be more ready inviolably to obſerve, if we had a juſt and humble Senſe of the <hi>Weakneſs</hi> of our <hi>Underſtandings,</hi> and great Deficiency of our Knowledge, in this mutable, mortal, miſerable and imperfect State?

And be ready to exerciſe the ſame <hi>Forbearance</hi> towards them, that we deſire and expect? If not, how can we love our Neighbour as ourſelves? The Obſervance of which <hi>Precept,</hi> you know, Sirs, as it is highly rational in itſelf, ſo it is of the laſt Importance in all Societies, both civil and religious; why therefore ſhould we not ſtoop to the humbleſt Offices of <hi>Kindneſs</hi> towards them? <hi>And if any of them are overtaken with a Fault, to reſtore ſuch with the</hi> Spirit <hi>of</hi> Meekneſs, <hi>conſidering ourſelves, leaſt we alſo ſhould be tempted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Vindication</hi> of Miſdemeanours committed againſt us, does not belong to us, for indeed we are not competent <hi>Judges</hi> of them; it being (our own Cauſe) nor rightful <hi>Executors</hi> of the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> due for them; and therefore GOD has reaſonably reſerved this difficult <hi>Province</hi> to himſelf, <hi>Vengeance is mine, ſaith the Lord, and I will repay it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>INSTEAD of exciting <hi>Revenge,</hi> to which we have naturally ſuch a wild, fierce and ungovernable <hi>Proneſs,</hi> we are obliged by the <hi>Religion</hi> of JESUS, to interpret our Neighbour's <hi>Offences</hi> in the mildeſt Senſe they are capable of, as flowing from <hi>Infirmity</hi> or <hi>Miſtake,</hi> and to forgive them, in imitation of the bleſſed GOD, who is <hi>gracious and merciful, and ſlow to anger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE ourſelves being ſubject to the ſame, or greater Faults, do need <hi>Pardon</hi> from others; and therefore ſhould extend the ſame to them: And if GOD has forgiven us a Thouſand <hi>Talents</hi> ſhall we take our <hi>Brother</hi> by the <hi>Throat</hi> for a few <hi>Pence?</hi> And indeed the Almighty has made our forgiving others, a neceſſary Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our obtaining Pardon ourſelves.

Father forgive your Treſpaſſes.</hi> Nor does private <hi>Revenge</hi> do any Service, but on the contrary, provoke to greater Injuries.</p>
            <p>BUT the <hi>Example</hi> of our LORD, ſhould eſpecially enduce us to <hi>Meekneſs</hi> and <hi>Patience;</hi> and hence we are commanded <hi>to learn of him, who is meek and lowly in Heart,</hi> (and aſſured that in this way) <hi>we ſhall find reſt to our Souls.</hi> And elſewhere we are enjoin'd, <hi>to conſider him who endured the Contradiction of Sinners againſt himſelf, leaſt we be weary and faint in our Minds.</hi>

            <p>THE <hi>Example</hi> of our LORD, my Brethren, was the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, amiable and glorious of this Kind that ever was preſented to human View; he was above all Expreſſion, <hi>a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with Grief;</hi> his whole Life was a continued <hi>train</hi> of <hi>Miſeries;</hi> and therein ſhone forth with unclouded and inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible Brightneſs, the unſtain'd, uninterrupted exerciſe of <hi>Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> in all their amiable Oriency, Charms and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractives.</p>
            <p>HIS <hi>Parentage</hi> was, to appearance, obſcure and mean.

            <p>NOR was he only in a low and poor Eſtate, but environ'd round with the moſt formidable <hi>Dangers,</hi> and expos'd to all the <hi>Darts</hi> of <hi>Envy</hi> in their utmoſt virulence and malignity, <hi>the World hated him becauſe he was not of it, and ſought to ſlay him;</hi> and this in return for the moſt important unparallel'd and condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Kindneſs</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> that ever was or can be expreſſed to the Sons of Men! Yet he was grievouſly aſperſs'd and inhumanly perſecuted, without committing the leaſt Offence; theſe Things our LORD bore with an undiſturb'd <hi>calm</hi> of <hi>Mind,</hi> and inſtead of <hi>Revenge,</hi> pour'd down <hi>Bleſſings</hi> on his <hi>Enemies:</hi> He inſtructed their <hi>Minds,</hi> forgave their <hi>Offences,</hi> ſympathiz'd with them in their <hi>Straits,</hi> their <hi>Sorrows,</hi> healed their <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> and ſupplicated his Father in their favour, <hi>Father forgive them!</hi>

            <p>LOVE, Dear Sirs, is <hi>eſſential</hi> to the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> and hence it's called by our Lord himſelf, <hi>the firſt and great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi> (Mat. xxii. 37, 38, 39.) and truly ſo it is, in reſpect of its <hi>Object,</hi> its <hi>Order,</hi> its <hi>Obligation,</hi> its <hi>Extent,</hi> its <hi>Excellency,</hi> its <hi>End.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Supreme <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> is the higheſt and beſt of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the bleſſed GOD, who is the Supreme <hi>Excellency</hi> and the <hi>chief Good. Auguſtine</hi> eſteemed it as an ineſtimable <hi>Privilege,</hi> that he had Liberty to <hi>Love.</hi>
               <q>Who am I, ſaith he, that thou
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:006423_0141_1028E3E6C8B83938"/>
commandeſt me to love, and threatneſt me with Miſery if I do not love thee.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>order</hi> and <hi>dignity</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> is ſuch, that we muſt place it before all other <hi>Graces</hi> and <hi>Duties,</hi> as the <hi>Foundation</hi> of <hi>Piety:</hi> Whatſoever is taught in the <hi>Law,</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> flows from this as a <hi>Fountain,</hi> and grows upon this as a <hi>Root,</hi> and hence we are commanded to be <hi>rooted and grounded in Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Obligation</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> is indiſpenſable, and perpetual. As <hi>Jehovah</hi> firſt beſtows his <hi>Love</hi> upon us, and then whatever he conferrs afterwards, he gives in <hi>Love,</hi> ſo the bleſſed GOD requires, that we firſt give him our <hi>Love,</hi> and then do all from that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. No Duty can warrant the Intermiſſion of our <hi>Love</hi> one Moment; divers other Duties may be diſpens'd with for a Time, but the Almighty can no more diſpenſe with this then deny himſelf!</p>
            <p>THE <hi>extent</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> is exceeding large, in reſpect of its <hi>Object, Subject, Duration;</hi> it regards its ſupreme <hi>Object</hi> the bleſſed GOD, with a ſupreme reſpect, in the <hi>Unity</hi> of his <hi>Eſſence,</hi> and <hi>Trinity</hi> of <hi>Perſons,</hi> in all his <hi>atributes,</hi> both incommunicable and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable, and in all the <hi>Diſcoveries</hi> he has given of them in his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>Creation, Redemption</hi> and <hi>Providence:</hi> It is likewiſe carry'd out to its inferior OBJECT the whole <hi>Human race,</hi> with <hi>Benignity</hi> and <hi>Benevolence,</hi> and towards the viſible <hi>Children</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> or <hi>Saints</hi> of GOD (according to the Sentiment of Charity) with peculiar <hi>Complacence!</hi> As to its SUBJECT, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the harmonius Concurrence of all our <hi>Powers,</hi> the whole Man, <hi>the whole Heart and Soul, the whole Mind, the whole Strength,</hi> as the great Prophet of the Church informs us. As to its DURATION it is Everlaſting. Moſt of the other Commands ſhall expire with this World, but this endures forever, when <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Mortification</hi> which do or ought to employ, a conſiderable Part of our Time expire, when <hi>Faith</hi> turns into <hi>viſion,</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> into <hi>fruition, Love</hi> will <hi>live,</hi> and <hi>burn</hi> in all its <hi>Beauty</hi> and Brightneſs, with an unmix'd, undeminiſh'd, uninterrupted and eternal <hi>Flame.</hi> Here it is weakned and diverted by a variety of ſenſible <hi>Objects,</hi> and ſtrong <hi>Temptations,</hi> but there it will run in one continu'd <hi>Current</hi> towards its glorious Object and Center, without <hi>fear</hi> or <hi>jealouſy</hi> forever: <hi>Charity</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>never faileth; but whether there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Excellency</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> is tranſcendent, in regard of its <hi>Matter. Love</hi> to GOD, and conſequently <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>Man,</hi> (which in the Judgment of our Saviour <hi>is like to it)</hi> is the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent of all Graces. <hi>Love</hi> among the <hi>Graces,</hi> is like the <hi>Sun</hi> among the <hi>Stars,</hi> which not only enlightens the lower World, but illuminates the <hi>Stars</hi> themſelves: <hi>Love</hi> does not only do its own <hi>Office</hi> but it enlivens the other <hi>Graces,</hi> and gives <hi>freſh ſprings</hi>

to all the <hi>Offices</hi> of <hi>Devotion,</hi> to all the <hi>Duties</hi> of <hi>Obedience;</hi> both active and paſſive, it makes us ready to <hi>run,</hi> in the <hi>Path</hi> of the one, and glad to <hi>endure</hi> the <hi>Yoke</hi> of the other: When our Hearts are enlarg'd by <hi>Love,</hi> with the devout <hi>Pſalmiſt, we run in the Way of GOD's Commandments:</hi> When our <hi>Boſoms</hi> beat with <hi>Love,</hi> we will not with bleſſed <hi>Paul, count our Lives Dear, that we may finiſh our courſe with Joy;</hi> but on the contrary, with the <hi>primitive Chriſtians, rejoyce that we are counted worthy to ſuffer Reproach for CHRIST's Name ſake. Love</hi> does not behave itſelf unſeemly but beareth all Things, beliveth all Things. <hi>Love</hi> is a conformity to the <hi>Nature</hi> of the bleſſed GOD, who is not only loving, but <hi>Love. Love</hi> is as it were a grateful <hi>requital</hi> of GOD, with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like the <hi>Kindneſs</hi> he Vouchſafes: <hi>Jehovah</hi> may require many Things of us, but he requires nothing like this of <hi>Love;</hi> becauſe this is the only thing by which we can anſwer GOD in <hi>kind;</hi> in other Things we cannot render alike for alike. The Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty created us, preſerves us, and confers many benefits upon us, but we can do nothing like theſe Things for GOD, he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely above our returns, but by Love, we render ſomething like his Love to us. Love contains all the Divine <hi>Precepts</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Goſpel</hi> in its Boſom; partly becauſe no Endeavour to obey any of them without it will be accepted, but every honeſt Endeavour will be accepted with it; and partly becauſe it realy inclines us to obey them all, and therefore virtually contains in it <hi>obedience</hi> to them all: And thus it may be truly call'd the <hi>Full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fillment</hi> of the <hi>Law:</hi> For it is realy ſo in the ſight of GOD, in <hi>Deſign, Diſpoſition</hi> and <hi>Principle.</hi> Tho' <hi>David</hi> did not actually build the <hi>Temple,</hi> yet becauſe he ſincerely intended it and was ſtrongly inclined to it, it is therefore ſaid by GOD himſelf, to be done. Farther, <hi>Love</hi> appears to be the firſt and great <hi>Command,</hi> if it be conſider'd as an <hi>End,</hi> all the Commands are refer'd to it, as their laſt Subordinate <hi>End</hi> and <hi>Scope:</hi> Upon the Account of which, or to promote which <hi>is the End of the Commandment;</hi> or rather <hi>Promiſe,</hi> as the Word <hi>Epangelias</hi> generally ſignifies, that is the <hi>Goſpel</hi> which includes, and recommends the Law; (See 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> i. 5.) <hi>The End of the Commandment is Charity:</hi> As if the Apoſtle had ſaid the Deſign and Perfection of the whole Chriſtian Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is not <hi>Strife</hi> and <hi>Contention,</hi> which curious Queſtions create, but <hi>love</hi> to God and Man, and godly Edification, the proper Fruit thereof. Our Doctrine tends to <hi>love,</hi> but their's to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention:</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I may add, that as LOVE is the <hi>End</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Goſpel,</hi> ſo it is of all the Chriſtian <hi>Graces, e. g.</hi> ſpiritual <hi>Knowledge</hi> tends to it, terminates in it, and is vain without it; the more we know of God, and divine Things, the more we are induced to <hi>love</hi>

            </p>
            <p>FARTHER, as <hi>Love</hi> is the <hi>End</hi> of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> ſo it is of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope; Faith</hi> leads to it by giving us a realizing view of the moſt excellent Objects, which naturally, when beheld in proper Points of Light, command Veneration, and excite Deſire: And as <hi>Faith</hi> leads to <hi>love</hi> as a principle of Action, ſo it works by it as a Mean or Inſtrument of Action, and excites to earneſt and univerſal Obedience from that principle, and by that mean, (Gal. v. 6.) <hi>for in Chriſt Jeſus neither Circumciſion availeth any Thing, nor uncircumſion (i. e.</hi> to Salvation) <hi>but Faith that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THUS <hi>love</hi> is the End of <hi>Hope; we rejoice,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>in the Hope of the Glory of God, with Joy unſpeakable and full of Glory.</hi> Now what is <hi>rejoicing,</hi> but a <hi>love</hi> of <hi>Delight</hi> in the <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>Deſire,</hi> either apprehended or poſſeſſed? This <hi>Hope</hi> promotes, and therefore is referred to it as its End. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle farther confirms what I have been obſerving, by theſe Words, (1 Cor. xiii. 13.) <hi>And now abideth Faith, Hope, Charity, but the greateſt of theſe is Charity.

            <p>NOW as the procuring and promoting of the Love of Men to GOD, and one another, was the Deſign of GOD the <hi>Father</hi> in projecting the <hi>Plan</hi> of Man's Redemption, and giving his <hi>Son</hi> out of his <hi>Boſom</hi> to a State of the greateſt Abaſement and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to purchaſe it, as well as of the <hi>Son</hi> of GOD in the whole of his mediatorial Office and Character; ſo likewiſe it is of the bleſſed SPIRIT, in his <hi>Function</hi> of COMFORTER; for according to the Order of the divine <hi>Oeconomy,</hi> he produc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>BUT <hi>Love,</hi> my Brethren, is not only <hi>eſſential</hi> to the <hi>Nature</hi> of true <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> but it is the grand <hi>Characteriſtick</hi> of its <hi>ſincere Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors,</hi> it is indeed a ſatisfying <hi>Evidence</hi> to ourſelves of our Integrity when it is <hi>ſincere,</hi> chiefly for the ſake of other's <hi>Piety, proportioned</hi> to the <hi>Degrees</hi> of it, that is, if we love thoſe moſt that we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend to be the moſt holy, whether of our Sentiments or not in leſſer Things; and if it be <hi>univerſal</hi> to all that we have Reaſon to think are really religious, and <hi>effectual,</hi> ſhewing itſelf in <hi>Deed</hi> and in <hi>Truth</hi> as Occaſion requires, and we are capable; <hi>for we know,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>John, that we have paſſed from Death to Life, becauſe we love the Brethren,</hi> (1 John iii. 14.) <hi>Beloved, let us love one another, for Love is of GOD, and every one that loveth is born of GOD, and knoweth GOD,</hi> (1 John iv. 7.) <hi>He that loveth his Brother, abideth in the Light, and there is no Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ſtumbling in him,</hi> (1 John ii. 10.)</p>
