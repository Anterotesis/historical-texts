            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <q>
                  <bibl>I SAMUEL, XXV.I.</bibl>
                  <p>And Samuel died; and all the Iſraelites were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him in his houſe at Ramah.—</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>WE have here but a ſhort account of <hi>Samuel</hi>'s death and burial. Though he was a great man, and one that was admirably well qualified for public ſervice, yet he ſpent the latter end of his days in retirement and obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: not becauſe he was ſuperannuated, for he knew how to preſide in a college of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; but becauſe Iſrael had rejected him, for which God chaſtiſed them, and becauſe his deſire was to be quiet, and to enjoy himſelf and his God in acts of devotion in his advanced years.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> All Iſrael lamented him: and they had reaſon; for they all found their loſs in loſing him. His perſonal merit commanded this honour to be done unto him at his death —his former ſervices to the public, while he
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:038551_0004_101257F0C8BB1798"/>
preſided over Iſrael, made a reſpect to his name and memory a juſt debt: it had been very ungrateful to have withheld it. <hi>Samuel</hi> was a conſtant interceſſor for Iſrael, he prayed daily for them: if he is gone they have loſt the beſt friend they have. The loſs is the more grievous, at this juncture, becauſe Saul was ſo outrageous: never was Samuel more wanted than now; yet now he is removed. We will hope the Iſraelites lamented Samuel's death the more bitterly, becauſe they remembered againſt themſelves their own ſin and folly in rejecting him. Thoſe have hard hearts, who can bury their own miniſters, and GOD's faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervants, with dry eyes; that are not ſenſible of the loſs of thoſe who, under GOD, have been their deliverers.</p>
            <p>They buried him:—not in the ſchool of the prophets; but in his own houſe, perhaps in his garden pertaining to it at Ramah, where he was born. Thus ended the life of that great man; but his GOD would not left his ſervant's name he buried with his mortal part: as ſaith the Pſalmiſt—
<q>
                  <l>The ſweet remembrance of the juſt,</l>
                  <l>Shall flouriſh when he ſleeps in duſt.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:038551_0005_101257F38F8311C0"/>Brethren, I have choſen the words of our Text, on the preſent mournful occaſion, becauſe there is ſuch a ſimilarity between the beloved <hi>Samuel,</hi> and the beloved <hi>Waſhington;</hi> both the ſervants of God—both the gifts of God to his beloved, though ſinful, people—both, under God, the ſaviours of their country—both the envy of kings, and ſcourge of tyrants—both beloved of the people in general in their lives, and both univerſally lamented in their deaths. And O! with what propriety did Iſrael la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the death of their beloved <hi>Samuel:</hi> he was the father of their Country, their friend, and the kind gift of their covenant God. And how much reaſon have the people of America to lament the death of their beloved <hi>Waſhington,</hi> who was equally the gift of God to them, as <hi>Samuel</hi> to the Iſraelites. But as I have ſaid there was a ſimilarity, between theſe two great characters, it ſhall be my buſineſs, on this mournful occaſion, to ſet forth that ſimilarity.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Firſt, Samuel,</hi> in his early age, was found active in the cauſe of God, which no doubt, was the ſalvation of Iſrael. In like manner, General <hi>Waſhington,</hi> early in life, in the weſtern
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:038551_0006_101257F6083FE870"/>
country, applied himſelf to the military pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion in the defence of his country, which no doubt was the cauſe of GOD, and terminated in the ſalvation of GOD's American Iſrael.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is remarkable that we have no more of <hi>Samuel</hi> from the time the Lord called him, while he dwelt in the houſe of Eli, until his country was beſieged by the Philiſtines, which was a ſpace of 20 years—then, in the time of danger, this great man ſteps forth, and gathered together all Iſrael to Mizpeh: there he prayed for them, and with them—there he counſelled and adviſed them, and by his prudent adviſe, the men of Iſrael went out of Mizpeh, and purſued the enemy, and ſmote them, (ſaith the text) until they came unto Bethcar, 1 Sam. vii.11. So the Philiſtines were ſubdued, and they came no more into the coaſts of Iſrael; and the hand of the LORD, was againſt the Philiſtines all the days of <hi>Samuel,</hi> verſe 13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Simile.</hi> In like manner, nothing material was heard of the great and good <hi>Waſhington</hi> after the Weſtern Expedition, until his American Iſrael was in the utmoſt danger of being deprived of their precious Liberty. Then our illuſtrious Hero ſteps forth, in the day
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:038551_0007_101257F7A0F48DD0"/>
of danger, in defence of our liberties and our lives, of our wives and of our children, and all that was dear to us. And after the example of his adorable Lord and maſter, the LORD JESUS CHRIST, he counted not his life dear unto himſelf; but ventured both life and fortune for the ſake of his country. It was not filthy lucre that moved the great, the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Waſhington;</hi> for he received no pay. No, ſirs, it was <hi>Dei Gratia,</hi> or the grace of GOD, in his noble heart, that moved him in all his heroic actions; and the power of Almighty GOD, that gave his ſervant <hi>Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> ſucceſs againſt the moſt powerful and well diſciplined army upon earth.</p>
            <p>How blind muſt that man be, that ſees not the hand of Almighty GOD with the Sword of <hi>Waſhington.</hi> It might be ſaid with propriety, as of old it was of Gideon, "The ſword of the Lord and of Gideon;" ſo we may ſay, The ſword of the Lord and of <hi>Waſhington,</hi> has made us the moſt free and happy people on earth: and though we lament this day the death of our dear <hi>Waſhington;</hi> yet we have reaſon, great reaſon, to rejoice, that the GOD of General <hi>Waſhington</hi> lives—ever lives, and is our GOD
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:038551_0008_101257FA1967A598"/>
—and who, I truſt, will protect us and bleſs us forever. Let us not, therefore, my brother officers and fellow citizens, "ſorrow as men without hope" for them that ſleep in him. For them that ſleep in CHRIST will GOD bring with him. It is right our beloved <hi>Waſhington</hi> ſhould "reſt from his labors, and his works follow him." Our eternal Father has called home the Father of our country —not to reſt at Mount <hi>Vernon,</hi> where his reſt has been frequently interrupted by the enemies of his beloved country; but far above the everlaſting hills—even, we truſt and believe, to the eternal heavens, where JESUS, the Almighty JESUS, ſmiles upon his ſervant <hi>Waſhington,</hi> and fully rewards him for his faithful ſervices while an inhabitant of this lower world. But to return:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Samuel</hi> like, he had the happineſs to ſee the American Iſrael, maſters of the field—under his auſpices, a happy and honorable peace—and our Independence acknowledged by his Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannic majeſty. And, as in the adminiſtration of <hi>Samuel,</hi> to wit, through his whole life, the Philiſtines no more troubled Iſrael; ſo, in like manner, through the whole adminiſtration of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:038551_0009_101257FDB26108A0"/>
the illuſtrious <hi>Waſhington,</hi> no enemy in an hoſtile manner, durſt invade our borders.</p>
            <p>After the whole work was finiſhed, our dear General retired to his ſeat at <hi>Mount-Vernon,</hi> to enjoy the pleaſures of domeſtic life: but this reſt was ſhort. Behold the great <hi>Waſhington</hi> was born for nobler ends—to rule GOD's American Iſrael: and as <hi>Samuel</hi> became the chief magiſtrate in all Iſrael, ſo our beloved <hi>Waſhington,</hi> by the appointment of Heaven, and the voice of all the People, became the chief magiſtrate, or governor, of the United States<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he was twice unanimouſly choſen to be the chief magiſtrate of a free people. In this high office, his conduct and prudence was ſuch as commanded the reſpect of all the people, from the higheſt to the loweſt. Even all the powers of Europe admired and revered our amiable Leader. Yet, nevertheleſs, though his charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was ſo ſpotleſs, in every point of view, as a Man—as a Chriſtian—as a Stateſman—as a brave Soldier—as a wiſe and valiant General —as a tender Parent to his people, and a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and diſintereſted friend to his country; yet, as it was with the infatuated Iſraelites, in rejecting and finding fault with the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:038551_0010_10125800263BC7E0"/>
of <hi>Samuel;</hi> ſo ſome of the people in the United States found fault with our deceaſed General, and with our happy federal and moſt glorious conſtitution, in the framing of which the deceaſed was a principal agent, and of which I may ſay, it is the moſt free and happy conſtitution in the world; for which we ought ever to adore the diſpoſer of all events. But, brethren, let us reflect, that when we ſin againſt our rulers, we ſin againſt God himſelf. See <hi>Samuel</hi> viii.7. thus ſaith the Lord to <hi>Samuel,</hi>
               <q>They have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I ſhould not reign over them.</q>
But why brethren, ſhould we wonder, that there are men found among us that ſlight General <hi>Waſhington,</hi> when it is too great a truth, that there are many among us who ſlight and treat with the greateſt diſreſpect the adorable and ever bleſſed JESUS, and the mild government of our gracious and ſin-par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning GOD. O! fooliſh people and unwiſe, thus to treat the Lord of glory. Fooliſh indeed muſt that mortal be, who dare attempt to ruſh upon the fierce boſſes of GOD Almighty's buckler. Can any of us bear everlaſting burnings, or dwell with devouring fire? Oh!
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:038551_0011_10125801C4504750"/>
no! no! Then, for your ſoul's ſake lay down the arms of your rebellion, while there is yet a poſſibility of obtaining mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, Samuel</hi> died, and all Iſrael lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him; and they buried him on his own place —and ſays the <hi>True American,</hi> "O painful reflexion! on Saturday, the 14 Inſtant <note n="*" place="bottom">December 1799.</note>, died ſuddenly, at his ſeat in Virginia, General GEORGE WASHINGTON, Commander in Chief of the Armies of the United States of America—mature in years—covered with glory, and rich in the affections of the American people. But our loſs, we have no doubt, is our illuſtrious Leader's gain:—and while we, with <hi>Eliſha,</hi> lament and cry, 'my Father, my Father, the chariots of Iſrael and the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men thereof,' our dear <hi>Waſhington</hi> has diſmiſſed his fiery chariot, being ſafely arrived far above the everlaſting hills—where ſin and ſorrow never come."</p>
            <p>Indeed, my brethren, the exit of this great man, the wonder of the age, may truly be ſaid to be a fiery trial, as his quivering lips pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced in his laſt agonies. As his reſpiration became difficult, he ſaid calmly, "I die hard
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:038551_0012_1012580438778160"/>
Doctor"—but notwithſtanding the excruciating agonies of his violent diſeaſe, he tranquilly aſked ſeveral queſtions during the evening. About 15 minutes before he died, he ſaid, "Doctor what is the Clock? How long am I to continue in this ſituation?" The Doctor an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, "Not long ſir"—he rejoined, with the firmeſt countenance imaginable, "I have no fear, Doctor, to die." O! happy <hi>Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton!</hi> O! man greatly beloved—Iſrael's King has well deſcribed thy caſe, Pſalm xxxvii.37. "Mark the perfect man, and behold the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right: for the end of that man is peace."</p>
            <p>Such was the peaceful departure of the great and good <hi>Waſhington.</hi> As he lived, ſo he died: tranquil in the field of battle; and beyond all human conception tranquil on a dying bed: we may truly ſay the end of ſuch a man was peace, as Mr. Harvey has beautifully deſcribed. "The ſufferer, all patient and adoring, ſubmits to the divine will; and, by ſubmiſſion, becomes ſuperior to his afflictions. He is ſenſibly touched with the diſconſolate ſtate of his attendants; and pierced with an anxious concern for his wife, the dear partner of his boſom, who will ſoon become a diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate widow. Yet, though caſt down, not in
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:038551_0013_10125807D678AB98"/>
deſpair. He is greatly refreſhed by his truſt in the everlaſting Covenant, and his hope of approaching glory. Religion gives a dignity to diſtreſs.—The ſoul juſt going to abandon the tottering clay, collects all her force, and exerts her laſt efforts." The good, the great <hi>Waſhington</hi> raiſes his dying hand—cloſes his own eyes and mouth—and, with the greateſt compoſure, reſigns his departing ſpirit into the hands of its divine Former, the ever adorable IMMANUEL, who is GOD over all, and bleſſed forever, Amen.</p>
            <p>Thus died the memorable <hi>Waſhington,</hi> in a very particular criſis. As it was with <hi>Samuel,</hi> as we ſaid before, at a time when Saul was ſo outrageous; ſo it was a peculiar time of danger to the United States, when our General died: a time, when ſome of the European powers threatened us with war and devaſtation. Never was there a time, when General <hi>Waſhington</hi> was more wanted than now—yet now he is removed—even ſo, Father, for ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight.</p>
            <p>My brethren, when men of common charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are ſwept from the theatre of life, they die without the tribute of public notice, as they
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:038551_0014_1012580A4FB047F8"/>
had lived without a claim to public eſteem. But when, in compliance with Heaven's high mandate, the Hero of the age lies numbered with the dead—when the reverend ſage—the auguſt ſtateſman—the father of his country has reſigned his breath: when the beloved of an empire—the envy and admiration of diſtant nations, and the brighteſt ornament of human nature, in this late age of the world— when <hi>Waſhington,</hi> the ſervant of divine IM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MANUEL, is no more—let a ſenſe of the general loſs be teſtified, by the badges of a general mourning;
<q>
                  <l>For as the ſtars that guild the vault of night,</l>
                  <l>Unnumber'd, pour effulgence on the ſight;</l>
                  <l>So Chiefs, and Senators in crouds abound:</l>
                  <l>But rare as comets <hi>Waſhingtons</hi> are found.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> they buried <hi>Samuel</hi> in his own houſe. So the mortal part of this great man was buried on his own place at Mount-Vernon, his once beloved retreat; where now remains the dear body of our beloved Chief, waiting till the laſt trump ſhall ſound to the general judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when the ever adorable and ineffable Redeemer ſhall come to be glorified in his
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:038551_0015_1012580BE93B05F0"/>
ſaints, and admired by all that believe. Tis then we may expect to ſee the now emaciated body of the dear deceaſed reunited to its ſiſter ſpirit, his noble and redeemed ſoul; and both ſoul and body fitted, by the Creator of all worlds, for the full enjoyment of Iſrael's God, forever and ever. Until that happy day, let us take comfort in contemplating the happy flight of our General's immortal part through the etherial blue to realms of bliſs: as ſaith the poet—
<q>
                  <l>"From Vernon's Mount behold the Hero riſe!</l>
                  <l>Reſplendent forms attend him through the ſkies;</l>
                  <l>The ſhades of war worn veteran's round him throng,</l>
                  <l>And lead enwrapt their honour'd Chief along.</l>
                  <l>A laurel wreath th' immortal <hi>Warren</hi> bears—</l>
                  <l>An arch triumphant <hi>Mercer's</hi> hand prepares—</l>
                  <l>Montgomery's god-like form directs the way,</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Green</hi> unfolds the gates of endleſs day.</l>
                  <l>While angels, trumpet tongued, proclaim thro' air,</l>
                  <l>Due honours for the firſt of men prepare."</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus ended the life of this great man: and as it is recorded of <hi>Samuel,</hi> that all the Iſraelites lamented him—ſo let it be recorded of General <hi>Waſhington,</hi> that every true American—that every ſon of Liberty—that every friend to the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:038551_0016_1012580E605079E8"/>
beſt and mildeſt government in the world la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented him. And how ſimilar is the lamentation for the great <hi>Waſhington</hi> to the lamentation made for the great <hi>Samuel.</hi> "And all the Iſraelites gathered together, and lamented him." And is it not ſo through the United States for the dear deceaſed? Do not the rulers and people every where gather together to make lamentation, and ſhow due honours to the deceaſed parent of their country? See the illuſtrious and excellent <hi>Adams,</hi> with the honourable Congreſs of the United States, deeply mourning and lamenting America's faithful friend, and ſhowing every mark of reſpect and pure affection to his memory. Take a view of his excellency <hi>Richard Howell,</hi> our worthy Governor and Commander in Chief of the Armies of New-Jerſey, with his aids, with mournful ſteps following the funeral proceſs in Philadelphia. See the patriots in every department, wearing the badge of mourning; ſhowing by this outward ſign, the inward and ſincere ſorrow of their ſouls, for ſo great a loſs as they feel in being deprived of their Commander in Chief. Take a view of the miniſters of JESUS CHRIST, of all
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:038551_0017_101258120C76DB60"/>
denominations, paying due reſpect to the memory of their patron, the excellent <hi>Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> the gift of their covenant GOD, who was as a nurſing father to the church of IMMANUEL while he continued among them. See the churches dedicated to the ſacred worſhip of Jehovah, all hung in deep mourning, all beſpeaking unfeigned ſorrow for the much loved <hi>Waſhington,</hi> the ſervant of the living GOD, of his church, and of his people.</p>
            <p>Such honour has our heavenly Father confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon his faithful ſervant's laſt remains: for ſurely, brethren, it is the ſearcher of hearts alone, that is able to melt the hearts of an whole empire. O! Bleſſed GOD! thou art divinely good, beyond all we poor mortals can conceive of thee, to them that ſerve thee in this lower world. Did any of the ſons of men ever ſerve our God, and did not in this preſent world receive ten thouſand fold, and in the world to come, life everlaſting? As ſaith the poet:

Let us ſtrive to imitate the example of that great man, and follow him as he followed CHRIST. Let us uſe all our power to promote the intereſt of our preſent moſt excellent government. Let us be found

But the rather, brethren, let us give diligence to be found obedient to thoſe whom GOD Almighty hath placed in authority over us. And, above all, my brethren, let us uſe fervent prayer, through the merits of divine Emanuel, for the revival of decayed religion among us—that our land may proſper, and our Independence maintain under the auſpices of the King eternal, immortal, and only wiſe GOD, JESUS CHRIST; to whom be glory, honour and power, forever and ever, Amen.</p>
