            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE PUBLIC.</head>
            <p>AS the affairs of GOVERNMENT and LIBER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY, are the greateſt points of controverſy, now in the world, it certainly is of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that our ideas be clear and juſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them. Permit me therefore to offer a few thoughts, upon a familiar metaphor, which the holy Ghoſt has uſed to illuſtrate their true nature. In Amos, v. 24. he ſays, <q>Let judgment run down as <hi>waters,</hi> and righteouſneſs as a <hi>mighty ſtream.</hi>
               </q> From whence we may obſerve,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> That judgment and righteouſneſs are eſſential to free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. When we would repreſent any thing as quite free, we ſay, it is as free as water. And not only the flow of mercy and grace from God to men, but alſo its effects in them, in producing obedience unto him, are often compared thereto in the word of truth—John, IV. 14. and VII. 38. Titus, 2.11, 12. and 3, 5—8. This is moſt certain, becauſe</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second.</hi> Freedom is not acting at random, but by reaſon and rule. Thoſe who walk after their own luſts, are <hi>clouds without water, carried about of winds;</hi> or <hi>raging waves of the ſea, foaming out their own ſhame;</hi> while the true SONS OF LI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERTY are like <hi>ſtreams,</hi> which <hi>run down</hi> in a clear and ſteady channel. David ſays, <hi>I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou ſhalt enlarge my heart. I will walk at liberty, for I ſeek thy precepts.</hi> Streams and rivers muſt have ſteady chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels to run in; but they that <hi>promiſe liberty</hi> while they <hi>deſpiſe government,</hi> are <hi>wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempeſt.</hi> 11 Pet. 2.10—19.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third.</hi> Though tyranny and licentiouſneſs often make a great noiſe, yet government and liberty are much ſtronger than they are. The former, like raging waves, daſh themſelves againſt the rocks, and die upon the ſhore; or like a tempeſt, after making ſad waſte and devaſtation, their ſtrength is gone, and their force is over. While the latter, like a <hi>mighty ſtream,</hi> carry all before them, and never reſt till they can get through or over all obſtacles, which are put in their way.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:015727_0003_0F99DDFBC0F11AA8"/>
               <hi>Fourth.</hi> Streams and rivers are of great uſe, and cauſe a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant flow of refreſhment and bleſſings wherever they come; ſo does the exerciſe and adminiſtration of judgment and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, among all people that enjoy them. Hence,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifth.</hi> The command of heaven is, <hi>Let them run down;</hi> put no obſtruction in their way. No, rather be in earneſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move every thing that hinders their free courſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixth.</hi> The context plainly ſhews, that a main obſtruction to theſe great bleſſings, among the people then ſpoken to, was their aſſuming a power to govern religion, inſtead of being go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by it. True religion is a voluntary obedience unto God. And the great deſign of all ordinances and acts of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip towards him, is that thereby we may obtain pardon and cleanſing, with direction and aſſiſtance to behave as we ought towards our fellow-men. But inſtead of this, thoſe people added their own inventions to divine inſtitutions, and ſubſtituted their acts of devotion towards God, in the place of a righteous practice towards men; or for a cover to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary conduct: And they would fain have been thought very religious, although they turned <hi>judgment into wormwood, hated him that rebuked in the gate, and abhorred him that ſpoke upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> Theſe things were written for our admonition; and all things of that nature, if indulged, will prove as pernicious to us, as they did to the Jews. And ſince ſelf-intereſt and ſelf-flattery have an amazing influence to blind men, concerning their own conduct in theſe affairs, great care ought to be taken to guard againſt deception therein. And perhaps a cloſe attention to two late publications, from the ruling party in this State, may be very ſerviceable in that reſpect.</p>
            <p>Eleven years ago, the epiſcopal clergy appeared very earneſt for having Biſhops eſtabliſhed in America; which cauſed Dr. Chauncy of Boſton, to write an anſwer the next year, to what Dr. Chandler had publiſhed upon that ſubject. And as Chandler had declared, that all they wanted, was only to have their church compleatly organized, without the leaſt deſign of injuring others, the beſt reaſon that Chauncy could give, why his requeſt ought not to be granted, was this: Says he,</p>
            <p>
               <q>We are, in principle, againſt all civil eſtabliſhments in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.—It does not appear to us, that God has entruſted the ſtate with a right to make religious eſtabliſhments. If the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:015727_0004_0F99DDFBEB623B50"/>
ſtate in England has this delegated authority, muſt it not be owned, that the ſtate in China, in Turkey, in Spain, has this authority likewiſe? What ſhould make the difference in the eye of true reaſon? Hath the ſtate of England been diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by heaven by any peculiar grant, beyond the ſtate in other countries? If it has let the grant be produced. If it has not, all ſtates have, in common, the ſame authority in eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments conformable to their own ſentiments in religion; what can the conſequence be, but infinite damage to the cauſe of God and true religion! And ſuch in fact has been the conſequence of theſe eſtabliſhments in all ages, and in all places. Should it be ſaid, we claim liberty of conſcience, and fully enjoy it; and why would we confine this privilege to our ſelves? Is it not as reaſonable, epiſcopalians ſhould both claim and enjoy it? It is readily allowed; and we are as willing they ſhould poſſeſs and exerciſe religious liberty in its full extent, as we deſire to do it ourſelves. But then, let it be heedfully minded, we claim <hi>no right</hi> to deſire the interpoſition of the <hi>ſtate</hi> to <hi>eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh</hi> that mode of worſhip, government, or diſcipline, we apprehend is moſt agreeable to the mind of Chriſt. We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſire no other liberty, than to be left unreſtrained in the exerciſe of our principles, in ſo far as we are good members of ſociety: And we are perfectly willing epiſcopalians ſhould enjoy this liberty to the full. If they think Biſhops, in their appropriated ſenſe, were conſtituted by Chriſt or his apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles we object not a word againſt their having as many of them as they pleaſe, if they will be content to have them with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority <hi>altogether</hi> derived from Chriſt. But they both claim and deſire a great deal more. They want to be diſtinguiſhed by having biſhops upon the footing of a <hi>ſtate-eſtabliſhment.</hi> The plain truth is, by the <hi>goſpel-charter,</hi> all profeſſed chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians are veſted with preciſely the ſame rights; nor has one denomination any more a right to the interpoſition of the civil magiſtrate, in their favour, than another; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this difference takes place, it is beſide the rule of <hi>ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and I may ſay alſo, the genuine dictates of <hi>uncorrupted reaſon.</hi>
               </q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Chauncy's anſwer to Chandler, page 152, 153, 179, 180.</note> From whence we may learn, that <hi>corrupt reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> have carried Dr. Chauncy's denomination on in a way <hi>beſide ſcripture rule,</hi> for theſe hundred and forty years; for juſt ſo long have their rulers interpoſed their authority, to ſupport
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:015727_0005_0F99DDFD0FF37730"/>
their religious miniſters by <hi>aſſeſſment</hi> and <hi>diſtreſs,</hi> to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable damage of other denominations, and contrary to the practice of the firſt planters of the country, for eighteen years. And that <hi>partiality</hi> was wholly an arbitrary uſurpation of the ruling party, without the leaſt warrant for it, in either of our charters; yet the majority of the convention laſt winter, voted to incorporate thoſe eccleſiaſtical laws with others, into the new conſtitution of government, which they were framing for us, which, if it had been received by the people, would have eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed them in another manner than ever they were before.— Upon hearing of which, the agent and committee of our Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt churches met at Boſton, Feb. 21, and drew up a proteſt, and petition to our next Aſſembly againſt it; wherein they ſhew, that thoſe laws are contrary to chriſtian liberty, exclude Chriſt from being the only lawgiver and head of his church, are a breach of public faith, as they tax people where they are not repreſented, and impower the majority to judge for the reſt about ſpiritual guides, which naturally cauſes <hi>envying and ſtrife,</hi> contrary to the wiſdom that is from above, which is <hi>without partiality, and without hypocriſy.</hi> And they cloſe with ſaying, <q>Our earneſt prayer is, that your honors may be the happy inſtruments of promoting ſuch <hi>impartial peace,</hi> as to fix it as a fundamental principle of our conſtitution, that religious miniſters ſhall be ſupported only by Chriſt's authority, and not at all by aſſeſſment and ſecular force: which impartial liberty has long been claimed and enjoyed by the town of Boſton.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Great numbers, and of various denominations, ſubſcribed this addreſs to our Aſſembly; <note n="†" place="bottom">Which would have been preſented, if the conſtitution had been received.</note> which alarmed a number of miniſters; and Mr. Phillips Payſon, who preached the Election ſermon, at Boſton, May 27th, commended the conſtitution that was framed for us laſt winter, and ſays, "It may juſtly be conſidered as a high evidence of the abilities of its compilers, and if it ſhould not be complied with, it is very probable we never ſhall obtain a better." And he ſaid to the Aſſembly,</p>
            <p>"The importance of religion to civil ſociety and government, is great indeed, as it keeps alive the beſt ſenſe of moral obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a matter of ſuch extenſive utility, eſpecially in reſpect to
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:015727_0006_0F99DDFD698B5488"/>
an oath, which is one of the principal inſtruments of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The fear and reverence of God, and the terrors of eternity, are the moſt powerful reſtraints upon the minds of men. And hence it is of ſpecial importance in a free govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the ſpirit of which being always friendly to the ſacred rights of conſcience, it will hold up the goſpel as the great rule of faith and practice. Eſtabliſhed modes and uſages in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, more eſpecially the ſtated public worſhip of God, ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally form the principles and manners of a people, that changes, or alterations in theſe, eſpecially, when nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the ſpirit and ſimplicity of the goſpel, may well be eſteemed very dangerous experiments in government. For this and other reaſons, the thoughtful and wiſe among us, truſt that our civil fathers, from a regard to goſpel worſhip, and the conſtitution of theſe churches, will carefully preſerve them; and at all times, guard againſt every innovation, that might tend to overſet the public worſhip of God, though ſuch inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations may be urged from the moſt foaming zeal. Perſons of a gloomy, ghoſtly and myſtic caſt, abſorbed in viſionary ſcenes, deſerve but little notice in matters, either of religion or government. Let the reſtraints of religion, once be broken down, as they infallibly would be, by leaving the ſubject of public worſhip to the humors of the multitude; and we might well defy all human wiſdom and power, to ſupport and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve order and government in the State."<note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>Perhaps many may think, that the two authors I have quoted upon religious eſtabliſhments, are of oppoſite ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, if not of different denominations, in religion.— Could this thought be ſupported by evidence, it would readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be admitted; rather than to ſuppoſe them guilty, of ſuch ſelf-contradiction, as they moſt certainly are. For facts abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſhew, that Dr. Chauncy has exerted himſelf, from time to time, to defend the eſtabliſhment we complain of, much more than Mr. Payſon has done. And to defend it againſt the biſhops, the firſt of theſe gentleman ſays, "It does not appear, to us, that God has entruſted the ſtate with a right to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious eſtabliſhments." The other warns our civil rulers, againſt ſuffering any changes in their "eſtabliſhed modes and uſages in religion." The firſt declares, that ſuch eſtabliſhments <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

religion, in all ages, and in all places.</hi> The other ſays, "The thoughtful and wiſe among us, truſt that our <hi>civil fathers,</hi> from a regard to goſpel worſhip, and the <hi>conſtitution of theſe churches,</hi> will carefully <hi>preſerve them;</hi> and at all times, guard againſt every innovation, that might tend to <hi>overſet</hi> the public <hi>worſhip of God."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Jews at Theſſalonica, when moved with envy, cried to their rulers, <hi>Theſe that have turned the world upſide down, are come hither alſo.</hi> But for a profeſſed miniſter of Chriſt, to alarm our civil rulers of danger, that the <hi>worſhip of God</hi> would be <hi>overſet,</hi> if <hi>they</hi> did not carefully <hi>preſerve theſe churches,</hi> is much more ſurprizing! He ſays, "Perſons of a gloomy, ghoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and myſtic caſt, abſorbed in viſionary ſcenes, deſerve but little notice in matters, either of religion or government." And indeed I think ſo too; and to whom can theſe epithets belong ſo properly, as to thoſe, who think that the church of Chriſt, and the worſhip of God, would be overſet, if ſecular force was not uſed to ſupport them? Are ſuch churches built upon the ROCK, or upon the <hi>ſand?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This gentleman ſays, "The language of juſt complaint, the voice of real grievance, in moſt caſes, may eaſily be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the meer clamor of <hi>ſelfiſh, turbulent</hi> and <hi>diſappointed</hi> men. The ear of a righteous government will always be open to the former; its hand, with wiſdom and prudence will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the latter." <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 22.</note>— This is an important truth. And ſince he warns our rulers againſt innovations, I think i my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, plainly to mention ſome of them, which his party have been guilty of in our land. The learned tell us, that to innovate, is "to introduce, or practiſe new cuſtoms, opinions, or laws, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſly, clandeſtine manner. And let the public judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his party have not done ſo, in the following inſtances; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have doubtleſs had many pious men among them.</p>
            <p>The Maſſachuſetts company came over to New-England, ten years after Plymouth people had begun the ſettlement thereof. <note n="†" place="bottom">My hiſtory, page xlv, lxii, lxiii.</note> The charter, which conſtituted them a civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, expreſsly limited them, not to make any laws con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the laws of England; and all the freemen, who were
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:015727_0008_0F99DDFF157360F8"/>
admitted to vote for their rulers, took an oath of allegience to the government, wherein they ſolemnly engaged to ſubmit to, "all ſuch laws, orders, ſentences and decrees, as ſhould be <hi>lawfully</hi> made and publiſhed by them." <note n="*" place="bottom">Page 61, 518.</note> But when they ſet out to frame and enforce a new religious eſtabliſhment, very contrary to that of England, they found that their oath ſtood in the way of it; therefore they paſſed an act, four years after they came to Boſton, to abſolve themſelves, and all the freemen, from their oath to keep acts <hi>lawfully</hi> made, and framed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, of ſubmiſſion to all ſuch laws as they called <hi>wholeſome.</hi> Was not this an innovation of the worſt kind?</p>
            <p>The following year the court ſent out to all their miniſters and brethren, for advice and aſſiſtance, about <hi>one uniform order</hi> of diſcipline in their churches;<note n="†" place="bottom">Page 62, 66.</note> and at the ſame time paſſed an act, to compel every male within their juriſdiction, of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years old and above, to take this new invented oath, or be puniſhed at their diſcretion.</p>
            <p>Mr. Roger Williams was then miniſter of Salem; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he publicly warned his flock againſt taking that oath, he was ſoon convented before the rulers at Boſton:<note n="‡" place="bottom">Page 57, 66, 70, 338, 452, 500, 536.</note> But he boldly ſtood his ground, againſt them and their miniſters too. The next time their aſſembly met, they took away a valuable tract of land from his church, till they ſhould give the court ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction upon theſe matters. For this, Mr. Williams and his church, wrote letters of reproof to the churches where thoſe rulers belonged; but inſtead of repenting of this iniquity, they baniſhed him out of their colony.<note n="§" place="bottom">Page 71, 76, 88 95, 105, 134, 147 151, 154, 173, 189, 193, 257, 300, 337, 340, 349, 468, 508, 510.</note> Whereupon he went and founded the firſt civil government, that ever eſtabliſhed equal religious liberty, ſince the riſe of Antichriſt. And ſoon after gathered the firſt Baptiſt church in America. He alſo did the moſt to prevent the ruin of all theſe colonies by the Indians, of any one man in the country. Thus he overcame evil with good; while the advocates for the uſe of ſecular force in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, have requited him, and his friends, evil for good ever ſince.</p>
            <p>And they were ſo far from promoting peace among themſelves by theſe means,<note n="‖" place="bottom">Page 79, 82.</note> that in leſs than a year after his baniſhment,

And becauſe a new houſe of repreſentatives refuſed to join in puniſhing ſuch as the ſynod had condemned, it was immediately diſſolved, and another houſe called; and then ſeveral were baniſhed, and ſeventy-ſix men were diſarmed, of whom fifty-eight were of Boſton.<note n="†" place="bottom">Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix, page 7—15.</note> The year after they made their firſt law to ſupport miniſters by aſſeſſment and diſtreſs; which was followed with finings, impriſonings, whippings and hangings; and with the exertion of all their art and power, for forty years after, in various attemps to divide and conquer Rhode-Iſland colony. And all the diſorders, which theſe and other means could produce therein, have been uſed ever ſince, as a moſt prevailing argument for an eſtabliſhed religion by human laws.</p>
            <p>And thoſe violations of the rights of conſcience, furniſhed the Britiſh court with the moſt plauſable plea they ever had, <note n="‡" place="bottom">Page 399, 404, 457, 481, 486, 491, 517, 520, 539.—</note> for taking away our firſt charter; and in the ſecond, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving us of the ineſtimable priviledge of chuſing our chief rulers;<note n="§" place="bottom">Appendix, page 4, 14.</note> which was evidently the root of all the gall and wormwood, blood and ſlaughter, which we now deplore. For the crown being veſted with an arbitrary power of appointing our chief officers, the arbitrary requirement of our property to ſupport them, was the natural conſequence. And it is well known that conteſts about that matter kindled this bloody war. So that the ſcheme of religious eſtabliſhments by human laws, is ſtained with the guilt of all this blood.</p>
            <p>In my late hiſtory of New-England, a great number of proofs are produced to the above facts, and our opponents are welcome to diſcover any miſtakes therein, if they can. And I ſhall now cloſe, with earneſtly requeſting the attention of my dear countrymen to two points.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider what our civil liberties will be, if theſe men can have their wills. I need not inform you that all America are in arms againſt being taxed where they are not repreſented:
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:015727_0010_0F99DE03B4F56368"/>
But it is not more certain, that we are not repreſented in the Britiſh parliament, than it is, that our <hi>civil</hi> rulers are not our repreſentatives in <hi>religious</hi> affairs: Yet miniſters have long prevailed with them, to impoſe religious taxes, intirely out of their juriſdiction. And they have now been defied to preſerve order in the ſtate, if they ſhould drop that practice. "That magiſtrates ſhould thus ſuffer theſe incendiaries, and diſturbers of the public peace, might juſtly be wondered at (ſays the great Mr. Locke) if it did not appear, that they have been invited by them unto a participation of the ſpoil, and have therefore thought fit to make uſe of their coveteouſneſs and pride, as a means whereby to increaſe their own power."<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 353 392.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. How can liberty of conſcience be rightly enjoyed, till this iniquity is removed? The word of truth ſays, <hi>why is my liberty judged of another man's conſcience? Let every man be fully perſuaded in his own mind.</hi> But Mr. Payſon ſays, "Let the reſtraints of religion once be broken down, as they INFAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIBLY would be, by leaving the ſubject of public worſhip to the humours of the multitude, and we might well defy all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man wiſdom and power to ſupport and preſerve order in the ſtate." He tells of humours, but it is well known that no men are influenced more by diſtempered humours, than thoſe who are fond of arbitrary power. And if he had not been deeply abſorbed thereby in viſionary ſcenes, how could he poſſibly have delivered this ſentence as he did, directly in the face of glaring facts which then ſurrounded him, as well as againſt divine truth! By an expreſs law of this government, the <hi>multitude</hi> of people in Boſton, have been <hi>left</hi> intirely free, theſe eighty-five years, to chooſe what worſhip they would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon, and not to be compelled to pay a farthing to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port any that they did not chuſe: And there are proofs enough to ſhew, that this liberty has greatly contributed to the welfare and not the injury of the town. And his great ſwelling word, INFALLIBLY, is as contrary to the holy ſcriptures, as it is to experienced facts. That word ſays, <hi>in vain do they worſhip me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. If we have ſown unto you ſpiritual things, is it a great thing, if we ſhall reap your carnal things? The Lord hath ordained, that they who preach the goſpel, ſhould live of the goſpel. Let him that is taught in the word, communicate unto him that teacheth
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:015727_0011_0F99DE0516F486A0"/>
in all good things. Be not deceived, God is not mocked.</hi> And Chriſt ſolemnly forbids the giving of any countenance or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to teachers who bring not HIS DOCTRINE; of which each rational ſoul has an equal right to judge for himſelf.— Mat. xv.—Rom. xiv. 4.5.—1 Cor. ix. 1.14. and x. 15.29.— Gal. i. 8.9. and vi. 6.7.—2 John, x. 11. But the <hi>command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men</hi> among us, while they have allowed this liberty to Boſton, have expreſsly denied the ſame to the country; where they have ordained, that they who preach the goſpel, ſhall live of human laws; which laws are ſo oppoſite to theſe laws of Chriſt, that they empower the majority in each town or pariſh to judge for the reſt; even ſo, that if the minority were ever ſo <hi>fully perſuaded,</hi> that the pariſh miniſter <hi>perverted the goſpel,</hi> inſtead of teaching it truly, yet the majority might ſeize the goods, or impriſon the perſons, of the minority, to ſupport that blind guide! And the chief judge of each of our county courts have been required, from year to year, to charge the grand jury upon their oaths, to proſecute every pariſh in the county, that did not ſettle ſuch a miniſter as the court called orthodox. Though, at the ſame time, if any church, together with the town or pariſh, was ever ſo unanimous in the choice of a goſpel miniſter, yet there is an expreſs law of this govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that excludes him from being ſettled in their conſtitution, until he has an accademical degree, or an approbation from the majority of the ſettled miniſters in that county.</p>
            <p>And this conſtitution has been ſo far from promoting our public welfare, that if the whole town of Chelſea, where Mr. Payſon lives, was publicly ſold for the moſt it would fetch, it would go but a little way towards paying the coſts this govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have been put to, only for the ſitting of their legiſlature to form religious ſocieties, and to hear and act upon quarrels and diſputes of that nature, which they have no right to medle with. And how can juſtice and righteouſneſs ever have their free courſe among us, while men thus aſſume power to govern religion, inſtead of being governed by it?</p>
            <p>I am as ſenſible of the importance of religion, and of the utility of it to human ſociety, as Mr. Payſon is. And I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with him, that the fear and reverence of God, and the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of eternity, are the moſt powerful reſtraints upon the minds of men. But I am ſo far from thinking, with him, that theſe reſtraints would be broken down, if equal religious liberty
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:015727_0012_0F99DE0634FBD3D8"/>
was eſtabliſhed, that I am very certain we ſhould heretofore have ſuffered much more than we have done, if the reſtraints of religion had not often conſtrained his party to act contrary to their eccleſiaſtical laws, or to ſuſpend the execution of them. They often declare, that they allow us liberty of conſcience, and alſo complain of injury, if we recite former and latter acts of their party to prove the contrary. Juſt ſo has Dr. Chandler done with regard to biſhops; and he declares they had now no deſign of taxing America to them; yet he ſays, "Should a general tax be laid upon the country, and thereby a ſum be raiſed ſufficient for the purpoſe, I believe ſuch a tax would not amount to more than four pence in one hundred pounds; and this would be no mighty hardſhip upon the country. He that could think much of giving the ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandth part of his income to any uſe which the legiſlature of his country ſhould aſſign, deſerves not to be conſidered in the light of a good ſubject, or member of ſociety."<note n="*" place="bottom">Chandler's appeal, p. 107, 108.</note> Put in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer hereto, Dr. Chauncey ſays "If the country might be taxed four pence in one hundred pounds, it might for the ſame reaſon, and with as much juſtice, if it was thought the ſupport of biſhops called for it, be taxed four ſhillings, or four pounds, and ſo on." All but tories will allow this to be good reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and why is it not as good in a baptiſt as in a preſbyterian? He goes back 150 years, and tells of the EPISCOPAL YOKE OF BONDAGE, which our forefathers came into this wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to avoid, and ſays, "Shall it be declared in the face of the world, that this would be <hi>no hardſhip</hi> to their poſterity, and that they would be neither good ſubjects, nor good mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of ſociety, if they <hi>thought much</hi> of ſupporting that POWER which has been, and may again be TERRIBLY OPPRESSIVE!"<note n="†" place="bottom">Chauncey's anſwer, p. 193, 194.</note> True, Doctor: There lies the difficulty. It is not the PENCE, but the POWER, that alarms us. And ſince the legiſlature of this State paſſed an act, no longer ago than laſt September, to continue a tax of FOUR PENCE a year, upon the baptiſts in every pariſh where they live, as an anknowledgement of the POWER that they have long aſſumed over us in religious affairs, which we know has often been TERRIBLY OPPRESSIVE, how can we be blamed for refuſing to pay that acknowledgement; eſpecially when it is conſidered, that it is evident to us, that God never allowed any civil State upon earth, to impoſe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:015727_0013_0F99DE0666AF61A0"/>
taxes; but that he declared his vengeance againſt thoſe in Iſrael, who preſumed to uſe <hi>force</hi> in ſuch affairs. — 1 Sam. ii. 16.34. —Micah. iii. 5.12.</p>
            <p>Rulers, miniſters and people, ought to improve all their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, in their ſeveral ſtations, to promote and ſupport true religion by goſpel means and methods; but as the <hi>teaching the fear of God by the precepts of men,</hi> brought confuſion and ruin upon the Jewiſh nation—Iſaiah. xxix 13 21 — it ſurely is of infinite importance, that every lover of our dear country, be in earneſt to have it ſaved from ſuch iniquity, and from ſuch ruin.</p>

            <p>MANY talk ſo plauſible about religious liberty, that our good friends, who have not had ſenſible experience, of a contrary practice, can hardly believe, that a religious eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhment by human laws, is ſo evil and dangerous as it really is. This makes a recital of a few plain facts, highly proper at this time, in order to prevent ſuch evils for the future.</p>
            <p>Many of the baptiſts in this State, have long been convinced, that a giving in the annual certificates required by the ruling party, as the condition of our exemption from taxes to their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, contains an implicit acknowledgement of a power aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by man, which in reality belongs only to God. And in our appeal to the public, printed in Boſton five years ago, we have given the particular reaſons, why we cannot in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience perform that condition. Yet, only becauſe we have refuſed to wrong our conſciences in that reſpect, our people, in various places, have been taxed from year to year to poedo-baptiſt miniſters. And I am credibly informed, that the towns of Lancaſter and Aſhby have voted this year, that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs ſhall be made for ſuch taxes, upon the baptiſts therein, who refuſe a compliance with that condition. And another town has violated religious and civil rights to a much more ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing degree.</p>
            <p>Pepperell, in the county of Middleſex, has had a name for religion and regularity, and for an uncommon zeal in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of our country, againſt foreign invaders. But their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to their eccleſiaſtical eſtabliſhment, by human laws, has betrayed them into the following extravagance, viz. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Mr. Daniel Davis, who had ſome acquaintance with the baptiſts before he removed into that town, requeſted Mr. Samuel Fletcher, of Chelmsford, to come and preach at his houſe, and he, by a letter, had appointed a meeting there on
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:015727_0015_0F99DE07E6EB70A0"/>
March 19, 1778, his letter was broke open as it came into Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perel, after a town-meeting, and Mr. Nehemiah Hubbard, their town-clerk, and one of their ſelectmen, was for calling a vote whether he ſhould preach there or not. And as ſome aſked who this preacher was, Mr. Hubbard ſaid, he is old Timothy Fletcher's ſon; the fox-hunter's ſon, &amp;c. Such be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour cauſed Dr. Ephraim Lawrence to remind them of what was once ſaid about <hi>the carpenter's ſon;</hi> and ſo prevented a vote upon it; and Mr. Fletcher came and preached according to appointmen. And, at Dr. Lawrence's requeſt, he came again and preached at his houſe, on March 27th. But in the time of worſhip, the houſe was aſſaulted, by many inhabitants of the town, ſome of whom were their leading men; and one Temple, a traveller, was ſent in to break up the meeting, who ſpake out repeatedly for that purpoſe, till he was turned out of the houſe; and then they went to an adjacent tavern, from whence a ſcurrilous letter was wrote to the preacher, which, by advice, he burnt. Soon after another was ſent, directed thus: "To Samuel Fletcher, now in Pepperell." Wherein they ſay, "We ſhould be glad that you will not come into town ever again upon ſuch an errand; and you may rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your being treated with oppoſition and ſcorn. Don't, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your peril, come into town again on ſuch an errand, as it will certainly be oppoſed, as ever ſuch doctrine is delivered again in Pepperell, as we are united, and deſire no baptiſts in town. This for your intereſt. <hi>March</hi> 27, 1778.</p>
            <p>"It is acquieſced in by all friends to freedom and united<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs."</p>
            <p>This I copied from the original letter. Other threatnings were given out for the ſame purpoſe; though Mr. Fletcher was not deterred thereby from preaching again in that town in May. And on June 25, Mr. Iſaiah Parker, paſtor of the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt church in Harvard, came with him and preached there. The next morning they met again, when the aforeſaid Mr. Davis, Mr. Simeon Shattuck, and his wife, and three ſingle young perſons, gave a ſatisfying account of God's dealings with their ſouls, in order for baptiſm. In the afternoon they met by a river-ſide, for preaching and the adminiſtration of that ordinance, upon lands that three of them were heirs to, which it preſent is improved by their mother, Mrs. Lydia Wright. After prayer and ſinging, Mr. Fletcher read a text and began
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:015727_0016_0F99DE08AB149080"/>
his ſermon, juſt as Lieut. Col. Henry Woods, Capt. Nathaniel Laken, Cornet Simon Gilſon, Lieut. Jonas Varnum, Captain Jeremiah Shattuck, the before-named Mr. Hubbard, and a great number of their followers, came up; ſome of whom were armed with clubs and poles, and forbid our friends either to preach or baptize, any where within the limits of Pepperell. —Upon this breach of the peace, Mrs. Whright ſpake to thoſe diſturbers, and ordered them to depart from off her lands; but they refuſed to go. Mr. Parker deſired, that they would act like men, if they would not like Chriſtians: and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded them, of the liberty of conſcience <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>, and even the King of Britain <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> mentioned ſundry ſcriptures to prove the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> for ſuch liberty: But Cornet Gilſon ſaid, Don't quote ſcripture here! Theſe men had newly approved of the conſtitution of government, which was framed for us laſt winter, which, Mr. Parker told them, they had now broken. All this could not ſilence their cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; but in open contempt of our religious ſentiments, ſome of them took a dog into the river and plunged him. And further to inrage the populace the odious name Tory, was caſt upon Mr. Davis; and when he attempted to anſwer to that ſlander, Capt. Lakin, (a church member, and one of their committee of ſafety) ſaid, Hold your tongue, or I will beat your teeth down your throat!</p>
            <p>Hereupon Dr. Lawrence invited our injured friends to his houſe; and in an incloſure by his door, Mr. Fletcher finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſermon, though not without much noiſe and diſturbance from the oppoſite party And while Mr. Parker was at prayer, after ſermon, John Green, junior, and Joſhua Blood, who ſtood near him, made open diſturbance; though Mr. Parker ſays, that from a ſenſe of their ſafety under the divine protection, he bleſſed God, that there were none to make them afraid; upon which (as others teſtify) one of them ſaid aloud in prayer time, That is a d—d lie! After which, ſome of thoſe officers, with a bowle of liquor, hired Abraham Boynton, and Jeremiah Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, to go into a river that was near, where Boynton dipt Lawrence, and then aſked him if he believed? And upon ſaying he did not, he plunged him again, if not a third time. An as if all this was not enough, two dogs were carried into the water, in the preſence of the aforenamed leaders of the town,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:015727_0017_0F99DE09ECC78428"/>
and as they were put under water, Mr. Hubbard ſaid aloud. There is one dipt! There is another, &amp;c. with laughter and inſult among the multitude</p>
            <p>But leſt all this ſhould not deter our friends from their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Col. Woods, Capt. Lakin, and Mr. Hubbard, came into Dr. Lawrence's houſe; and when Mr Parker aſked them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would protect the Baptiſts in obeying Chriſt, in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm? Or whether they would act at the head of their moleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors? They refuſed a direct anſwer; but, calling for Mr. Fletch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er out of another room, they informed theſe miniſters, that they appeared there in behalf of the majority of the town of Pepperell, who were againſt having any Baptiſt preaching or baptizing therein; and therefore they adviſed ſaid miniſters, immediately to depart out of the town, for their own ſafety.— Do you mean, ſaid Mr. Parker, that our lives will be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger if we do not thus depart? This queſtion they would not anſwer, though Mr. Parker told them he ſhould take that to be their meaning if they did not explain it otherwiſe. After other diſcourſe, Mr. Parker addreſſed them in this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> I appeal to your conſciences, in the preſence of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom we muſt all appear hereafter, whether you have come up againſt us in the ſpirit of Chriſt and his diſciples, or in the temper of the perſecuting Jews againſt them! To this they made no anſwer; but ſoon left the houſe. Whereupon our friends privately agreed to diſperſe, and, by different ways to draw together to a diſtant place of water; which was effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſuch manner, that thoſe ſix perſons were decently baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, notwithſtanding the arrival of ſome mockers before it was over: And as they were returning to our friend Shattuck's houſe, they were met by Col. Woods and his followers, who ſhook their whips over them, and ſtruck ſome of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. And after their entrance into our ſaid friend's houſe, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſurrounded it, declaring they would have thoſe Baptiſt preachers out of town that night. Yet, as they prayed and ſang praiſes to God, the mob diſperſed, and they reſted there quietly; and returned home ſafely the next day, according to their purpoſe.</p>
            <p>A narrative of theſe tranſactions was ſaid before our aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation at Leiceſter, on the 9th inſtant; and upon conſideration thereof, it was judged to be expedient that I ſhould viſit thoſe
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:015727_0018_0F99DE0A44E73408"/>
injured friends, and collect as exact an account as I could of the true ſtate of the moſt material of thoſe facts, and to lay the ſame before the public. For though far leſs glaring breaches of the peace in ſuch reſpects, have heretofore been puniſhed by authority, in the ſouthern parts of this State; yet we had no certainty that theſe would meet with like treatment. For there were not only a principal part of Pepperell concerned therein, but Col. Woods was one of our law-givers laſt year, and many others of them are greatly afraid of looſing their legiſlative power over us in religious affairs; which, according to their own principles, depends intirely upon their continuing to be the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of this State. The author of their election ſermon two years ago, ſays, "The law of ſelf-preſervation will always juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify oppoſing a cruel and tyrannical impoſition—except where oppoſition is attended with greater evils than ſubmiſſion, which is frequently the caſe, where a few are oppreſſed by a large and powerful majority. This (ſays he) ſhews the reaſon, why the primitive chriſtians did not oppoſe the cruel perſecutions, that were inflicted upon them by the heathen magiſtrates. They were few, compared with the heathen world; and for them to have attempted to reſiſt their enemies by force, it would, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a mirracle, have brought upon them inevitable ruin and deſtruction." <note n="†" place="bottom">WEST's Election ſermon, at Boſton, May 29th, 1776. P. xix.</note> According to which opinion, Chriſt would have ordered the uſe of force in the firſt erecting of his church in the world, if he had not been ſo unhappy, as to begin the work at a time, when the heathen idols had a more powerful party than he had. But ſince the Baptiſts worſhip a Saviour, who always has had the moſt powerful party; and ſince he has taught them that the reaſon why he forbid the uſe of force in religion, is becauſe his kingdom is <hi>not of this world;</hi> they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, according to his word, to overcome all their accuſers, by the <hi>blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their teſtimony;</hi> and think it their duty to attend upon the uſe of thoſe means for that end. Indeed we apprehend that we have the ſame right to have our perſons and properties protected by authority, as our neighbour have; but party influence has denied it to us, in many inſtances. Three Baptiſts in Chelmsford, were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned above five years ago, for miniſterial taxes; and after ſpending the value of above an hundred ſilver dollars, the Court
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:015727_0019_0F99DE0E4BFF55B8"/>
at Charleſtown, gave judgment in their favour; yet the aſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors who taxed them contrary to law, ſoon had all their expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces paid by their town; while the Baptiſts have had neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences nor damages paid them to this time, as they aſſured me this week. Who then can blame us, for appealing to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial public, againſt ſuch oppreſſions?</p>
            <p>I have been to Pepperel, where I preached twice, and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized two perſons, without moleſtation. And from the beſt light I could gain, from many witneſſes, the above ſtate of facts is not exaggerated in any one circumſtance; which is publiſhed to prevent the like for the future.</p>
