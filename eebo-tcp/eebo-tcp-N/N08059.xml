            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AD the charge of <hi>REBELLION</hi> been made by a private perſon againſt the colonies on this continent, for their oppoſition to the <hi>Stamp Act,</hi> I ſhould not have thought it worth anſwering.—But when it was made by men veſted with a public character, by a committee of corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence, repreſenting two branches of legiſlature in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable government, and the charge was not only approved, as it is ſaid, by thoſe branches, but was actually publiſhed to the world in news-papers, it ſeemed to me to deſerve notice. I waited ſome time, in hopes of ſeeing the cauſe eſpouſed by an abler advocate, but being diſappointed, I reſolved, "favente Deo," to ſnatch a little time from the hurry of buſineſs, and to place, if I could, the letter of thoſe gentlemen to their agent in a proper light.</p>
            <p>It is very evident from the <hi>generality</hi> of their accuſation againſt their "fellow-ſubjects on the northern continent"; of the expreſſions they uſe in the latter part of their letter, when they ſpeak of the "violent ſpirit raiſed in the North-American colonies", and from what follows, that they do not apply the approbrious term they uſe, only to thoſe few of the lower rank, who diſturbed us with two or three mobs in ſome of the provinces, nor to any other particular claſs of people; but that the cenſure is deſigned for <hi>ALL the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of theſe colonies</hi> who were <hi>any way</hi> concerned in the <hi>oppoſition that has been given,</hi> and conſequently that the <hi>modes of that oppoſition</hi> are thereby condemned. Two conſiderations therefore have induced me to undertake their
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:010283_0003_0F7E712D1EEF4FC0"/>
defence. Firſt, to vindicate the honour of my country, which I think grosſly and wantonly inſulted. Secondly, to refute opinions, that in unfortunate times, may, if adopted, be injurious to liberty.</p>
            <p>Many good pieces, have been publiſhed in theſe colonies, to ſhew their title to the rights claimed by them; the invaſion of thoſe rights by the Stamp Act; the other hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips impoſed on them, and the bad conſequences that probably would follow theſe meaſures: but nothing has appeared, at leaſt I have ſeen nothing that I recollect, in defence of the <hi>principle</hi> on which the oppoſition has been made, and of the <hi>manner</hi> in which it has been conducted. Theſe are points entirely new; and the conſideration of them is now rendered neceſſary, by the public reproach that has been thrown on the people of this continent.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>IN compliance with the united reſolution of the two branches of our legiſlature, of which we have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally the honor to be members, and to compoſe their committee of correſpondence, We are now to deſire you to lay our complaints before his Majeſty and the Parliament, on the hardſhips which this community labours under by the impoſition of the Stamp Duties, lately put in force amongſt us. We have, indeed, ſubmitted, with all obedience, to the act of Parliament, yet our <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> has, by no means, ariſen from any conſciouſneſs of our ability to bear the burden of theſe taxes, or from the want of a due ſenſe of the <hi>oppreſſive weight of them in all its parts,</hi> but
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:010283_0004_0F7E712DDFDFAB00"/>
from a <hi>principle of loyalty</hi> to our King and Mother Country, which has carried us above every conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our own diſtreſſes: yet, if we have ſuffered without reſiſtance, we have learnt by it to complain with reaſon; and, ſince we have raiſed no clamours from our own fears, we muſt ſurely have the better title to <hi>remonſtrate from our feelings.</hi> But, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the manner in which our grievances in this caſe, along with ſo good a proof of our <hi>obedience to the laws of our mother country,</hi> are to be reported to his Majeſty and the parliament, we muſt <hi>refer ourſelves to your good judgment and diſcretion</hi>; ſo much better circumſtanced as you are on that ſide of the water to judge for us, than we can do at this diſtance for our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and ſo perfectly aſſured as we are alſo of your ability and zeal, in the conduct of every matter of importance that can be intruſted to your agency for this country's ſervice. To you, Sir, therefore we give the power, in the name of our council and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, to preſent ſuch a <hi>memorial,</hi> or <hi>memorials,</hi> to his Majeſty, and the two houſes of parliament (if to all be neceſſary) as to yourſelf ſhall ſeem moſt proper and adviſeable; ſetting forth the anxiety and diſtreſſes of our country, under this new and extraordinary burden of taxation, by which we not only find our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>loaded with a charge more than is proportioned to our circumſtances, but deprived alſo of a privilege, which renders the oppreſſion beyond meaſure grievous.</hi> We <hi>ſee two of the moſt important objects</hi> to ſuch a colony as ours, <hi>trade and juſtice crouching under the load of theſe new duties; and by the manner in which the duties have been impoſed, we find too the moſt valuable of all our civil rights and liberties ſinking along with them.</hi> The deſign of this new and extraordinary charge upon our country is, towards defraying the expences of defending, protecting and ſecuring, the colonies of AMERICA. But what new and extraordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:010283_0005_0F7E712E9F339450"/>
has this colony put the nation to, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of maintaining of troops quartered in the ſeveral provinces of NORTH-AMERICA, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and ſecurity of thoſe parts of the Britiſh dominions? This is juſt as reaſonable, and juſt as merciful too, as it would be to impoſe a heavy mulct on the inhabitants of this place, by way of a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the preſent <hi>REBELLIOUS oppoſition given to authority, by our fellow-ſubjects on the Northern con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.</hi> But if we are to be <hi>ſubject to the power of the parliament of Great-Britain in our internal taxes, we muſt be always liable to impoſitions, that have nothing but the will of the impoſers to direct them in the meaſure,</hi> ſince we have there no repreſentatives to inform them of the true ſtate of our circumſtances, and of the degree of our ſtrength to bear the burdens that are impoſed. How far, indeed, we are intitled, by the conſtitution of ENGLAND, or our own peculiar <hi>charter,</hi> to an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption</hi> from every other internal tax, than ſuch as may be laid upon us by the repreſentatives of our own people, in conjunction with the two other branches of our legiſlative body, <hi>we cannot poſitively ſay</hi>; but this is certain, that we have enjoyed that privilege, that <hi>ſeeming birthright</hi> of every BRITON, ever ſince the firſt eſtabliſhment of a civil government in this iſland to the preſent time. And why we ſhould at this period be condemned to the loſs of ſo <hi>ineſtimable a bleſſing of ſociety,</hi> we can ſee no cauſe; ſince the preſent period has afforded ſome inſtances of loyalty and affection to our King and mother country, which might rather have intitled us to new favours from the crown and nation, than have left us expoſed to any deprivation of our <hi>old and valuable rights.</hi> Yet, how far it may be prudent and neceſſary to preſs this laſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in your <hi>memorial</hi> to our ſuperiors, <hi>muſt be referred to your good judgment</hi>; for as we mean to obtain a redreſs of our grievances by a dutiful repreſentation
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:010283_0006_0F7E712F8C186F80"/>
only of our caſe, ſo would we have any thing avoided in the <hi>ſtile and ſubſtance of that repreſentation,</hi> as might give offence to thoſe from whom only our redreſs can come, our appeal being to the very powers by whom we think ourſelves oppreſſed; tho' we may remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to them with juſtice, <hi>we cannot reproach them without danger</hi>; and the moſt effectual means of giving ourſelves all the merit we hope for, and intend, both with our ſovereign and the parliament, will be, we think, by giving our complaint on this matter the <hi>complexion of our conduct,</hi> ſhewing an <hi>humble ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to authority,</hi> even under the moſt painful <hi>heart-burnings</hi> of our community, at its <hi>ſevere decrees.</hi> But, great as our diſtreſſes are, upon account of this new Taxation in its general courſe, we are yet fortunate enough not to have ſuffered ſo much greater, as by the particular calamity you ſeem to have apprehended for us, on the ſuppoſed ſeizure of the North-American traders; for the maſters of thoſe veſſels, producing certificates at our cuſtom-houſe, that no ſtamp papers were to be had at the ports they came from, have been admitted to an entry of their ſeveral ſhips and cargoes, being ſuppoſed only liable to the penalties inflicted by the Stamp Act, and of theſe no notice have been taken; ſo that our danger from the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances you ſuggeſted to the miniſters is over. But we ſee another ariſing from the violent ſpirit raiſed in the North-American colonies againſt this act, which threatens us with the ſame ill conſequences; we mean, from their avowed reſentment at the people of this iſland, for having ſo tamely ſubmitted to the act, which they had been pleaſed ſo reſolutely to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. This having led them to ſome extraordinary attempts (as we have been informed) to prevent any veſſels coming hither with proviſions for our ſupport, how far a combination of this kind, which has to ſtruggle with the private intereſts of ſo many indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals,
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:010283_0007_0F7E713043C7C9E8"/>
can be formed amongſt them, we may at firſt be led to doubt; yet, on a ſecond review of things, how far the exceſſes of <hi>popular fury,</hi> which has no bounds, may hurry away all thoſe individuals, to their own, as well as our immediate prejudice, we may reaſonably fear; and we think it, at leaſt, neceſſary to make mention of it to you, that you may take this, amongſt all the other unhappy conſequences we may feel from that injurious act, into your proper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> AM a <hi>North-American,</hi> and my intention is in addreſſing you at preſent, to anſwer ſo much of a late letter from you to your agent in <hi>London,</hi> as caſts unmerited cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure on my countrymen. After this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, as you entertain ſuch unfavorable ſentiments of the "popular fury" on this continent, I preſume you expect to be treated with all the exceſs of paſſion natural to a rude people. You are miſtaken. I am of their opinion, who think it almoſt as infamous, to diſgrace a good cauſe by illiberal language, as <hi>to betray it by unmanly timidity.</hi> Complaints may be made with dignity; inſults retorted with decency; and violated rights vindicated without violence of words.</p>
            <p>YOU have nothing therefore to apprehend from me, <hi>gentlemen,</hi> but ſuch reflections on your conduct, as may tend to rouſe that remorſe in you, which always ariſes in the minds of ingenuous perſons, when they find that they have wounded by their raſh calumnies the honor of thoſe, who merit their higheſt eſteem, —their warmeſt praiſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:010283_0009_0F7E7132B65AC3B0"/>I KNOW there are in the iſland of <hi>Barbados,</hi> many men of ſenſe, ſpirit, and virtue, and therefore I chuſe to conſider you rather in the character of ſuch, whoſe underſtanding, reſolution, and integrity, have been drugg'd by ſome pernicious draught into a ſlumber, than of thoſe, who with irretrievable depravity, want all the qualities requiſite to make them ſerviceable to their countrymen, or juſt to others.</p>
            <p>HAD I only heard, <hi>gentlemen,</hi> that you had called the behavior of theſe colonies, a "REBELLIOUS OPPOSITION given to authority," I ſhould have thought it a vain attempt, to aim at convincing you, how unjuſtifiable an aſperſion that expreſſion contained; becauſe I ſhould immediately have concluded, that you were ſo ignorant of the rights of <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſubjects, and ſo inſenſible of all concern on the invaſion of thoſe rights, that any man who ſhould endeavour to ſhew you your error, would engage in as unpromiſing a project, as if he ſhould think to communicate an idea of ſound to the deaf, or of colour to the blind.</p>
            <p>WHEN I read your letter, however, with an agreeable ſurprize I obſerved, that <hi>you,</hi> at the ſame time you have made the attack, have laid the foundation of a defence for my countrymen. Permit me to erect the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure, though I had much rather ſee it built by more ſkilful hands.</p>
            <p>YOU acknowledge, the "burthen of the taxes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the Stamp Act, to be OPPRESSIVE IN ALL ITS PARTS"; that you are thereby not only "loaded with a charge more than is proportioned to your circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, but DEPRIVED ALSO OF A PRIVILEGE, which renders the OPPRESSION BEYOND MEASURE GRIEVOUS:" that you "ſee two of the moſt important objects, TRADE and JUSTICE CROUCHING under the load of the
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:010283_0010_0F7E71332A59EB40"/>
new duties and by the manner in which theſe duties have been impoſed, find too the MOST VALUABLE OF ALL YOUR CIVIL RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES SINKING ALONG WITH THEM."</p>
            <p>YOU ſay that if you "are to be ſubject to the power of the parliament of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> in your internal taxes, you muſt always be liable to impoſitions, that have nothing but the WILL OF THE IMPOSERS to direct them in the meaſure." With what conſiſtency you afterwards heſitate, and "cannot ſay," whether the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of taxing yourſelves, excluſively belongs to you, or talk of a "SEEMING <hi>birthright,</hi>" I will leave to be determined by yourſelves, or the agent to whoſe "good judgment and diſcretion," you with ſuch ſtrange, I had almoſt ſaid "humble ſubmiſſion" "refer" your moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant affairs. However, your ſentiments ſoon veer about again, and you ſpeak of "AN INESTIMABLE BLESSING OF SOCIETY;" of "OLD AND VALUABLE RIGHTS, and even hazard the hardy appellation of "SEVERE DECREES."</p>
            <p>WHEN it is ſo evident, that all theſe aſſertions are equally true with regard to yourſelves, and "your fellow-ſubjects on the northern continent," it affords no ſlight cauſe of amazement, to ſee in the ſame letter that contains theſe aſſertions, the oppoſition to thoſe confeſſedly deſtructive meaſures, branded as "REBEL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIOUS". Wherefore this needleſs ſtroke againſt your "fellow-ſubjects?" Could not your "principle of loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty" ſink you to a ſatisfactory depth of humiliation, unleſs you flung yourſelves down with ſuch a rage of proſtration as to ſpatter all around you? Was not your ſurrender of "<hi>the moſt valuable of all rights and liberties</hi>" ſufficiently completed by your declaration, that you "COULD NOT POSITIVELY SAY <hi>you were intitled to them,</hi>" without reproaching thoſe who have the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:010283_0011_0F7E7133DC176418"/>
of differing ſo widely from you in their ſentiments, that they had rather die than make ſuch a declaration?</p>
            <p>TO talk of your "charter" <hi>gentlemen,</hi> on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, is but weakening the cauſe by relying on falſe aids. Your opinion on this head ſeems to be borrowed from the doctrine of the unhappy <hi>Stuarts.</hi> They thought, or pretended to think, all the liberties of the ſubject were mere favours granted by charters from the crown. Of conſequence, all claims of liberties not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly mentioned in thoſe charters, were regarded as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions of the prerogative, which according to them, was a power veſted in the prince, they could not tell how, for no better purpoſe, than to do as he pleaſed. But what ſaid the nation? They aſſerted, that the royal charters were <hi>declarations</hi> but not <hi>gifts</hi> of liberties, made as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions required, on thoſe points in which they were moſt neceſſary, without enumerating the reſt; and that the prerogative was a power veſted in <hi>one</hi> for the benefit of <hi>all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>KINGS or parliaments could not <hi>give</hi> the <hi>rights eſſential to happineſs,</hi> as you confeſs thoſe invaded by the Stamp Act to be. We claim them from a higher ſource—from the King of kings, and Lord of all the earth. They are not annexed to us by parchments and ſeals. They are created in us by the decrees of Providence, which eſtabliſh the laws of our nature. They are born with us; exiſt with us; and cannot be taken from us by any human power, without taking our lives. In ſhort, they are founded on the immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table maxims of reaſon and juſtice. It would be an inſult on the divine Majeſty to ſay, that he has given or allowed any man or body of men a <hi>right to make me miſerable.</hi> If no man or body of men has <hi>ſuch a rights,</hi> I have a <hi>right to be happy.</hi> If there can be no hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:010283_0012_0F7E7136A0EE7F08"/>
without freedom, I have a <hi>right to be free.</hi> If I cannot enjoy freedom without ſecurity of property, I have a <hi>right to be thus ſecured.</hi> If my property cannot be ſecure, in caſe others over whom I have no kind of influence, may take it from me by taxes, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the public good, and for enforcing their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, may ſubject me to arbitrary, expenſive, and remote juriſdictions, I have an <hi>excluſive right</hi> to lay taxes on my own property, either by myſelf or thoſe I can truſt; of neceſſity to judge in ſuch inſtances of the public good; and to be exempt from ſuch juriſdictions. —But no man can be ſecure in his property, who is "liable to <hi>impoſitions,</hi> that have NOTHING BUT THE WILL OF THE IMPOSERS to direct them in the meaſure;" and that make "JUSTICE TO CROUCH UNDER THEIR LOAD."</p>
            <p>THUS you prove, <hi>gentlemen,</hi> that the fatal act you allude to in theſe expreſſions, is deſtructive of our property, our freedom, our happineſs: that it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with reaſon and juſtice; and ſubverſive of thoſe ſacred rights which GOD himſelf from the infinity of his benevolence has beſtowed upon mankind.</p>
            <p>YET after theſe expreſſed or implied conceſſions, you term the oppoſition made by my countrymen to the execution of this—imagination cannot ſupply me with an epithet equal to my meaning—act, "REBEL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIOUS."</p>
            <p>PRAY, <hi>gentlemen,</hi> let me not miſtake your notion of "humble ſubmiſſion to authority." Do you main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that becauſe the parliament may legally make <hi>ſome</hi> laws to bind us, it therefore may legally make <hi>any</hi> laws to bind us? Do you aſſert, that where power is conſtitutionally veſted in particular perſons for certain purpoſes, the ſame obedience is due to the commands
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:010283_0013_0F7E71376FA8BAB8"/>
of thoſe perſons, when they exceed the limits of that power, as when they are reſtrained within them? Do you ſay, that all acts of authority are ſanctified by the mere pleaſure of their authors, and that "humble ſubmiſſion" is due to them, however injurious they may be to thoſe over whom they are exerciſed—or that the oppreſſed ought to content themſelves with "giving the COMPLEXION of your CONDUCT" to PALE petitions— and that <hi>all other</hi> oppoſition is "rebellious?"</p>
            <p>GREATLY I am afraid, that you have publiſhed to the world too convincing proofs, that you hold theſe ſentiments: ſentiments, which I ſolemnly profeſs are ſo horrible to me, that I cannot wiſh the infection of them even to the bittereſt enemies of my country.</p>
            <p>HAVE you conſidered, <hi>gentlemen,</hi> the importance of the points to which your political creed may be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? What is your opinion of the <hi>revolution,</hi> that made the <hi>Britiſh</hi> liberty and <hi>Britiſh</hi> glory blaze out with their brighteſt luſtre? Had you lived in thoſe days of ignorance, with what lucky aſſiſtance might you have propp'd up the tottering tyrant, by maxims of law to prove, <hi>that kings can do no wrong</hi>; and texts of ſcripture to ſhew, <hi>that ſubmiſſion is due to the powers that be!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is as manifeſt, that the great and good men who then placed the throne in the temple of liberty, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained your ſentiments, as it is, that if they had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved them, you would not at preſent enjoy the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of being ruled by a prince whoſe virtues do honour to his rank. All the happineſs you poſſeſs, you owe to the force of the principle, which you now reproach; and your profeſſing your reſolution to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in an "humble ſubmiſſion" to acts that you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly ſay, "make your oppreſſion beyond meaſure grievous," and deſtroy "the moſt valuable of your
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010283_0014_0F7E7137A627E608"/>
civil rights and liberties," is deſerting and betraying as much as you can, that principle, on which the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> is eſtabliſhed—A principle, that has operated differently among theſe colonies, as became them, from what it did in that kingdom at the memorable period abovementioned—not in <hi>action,</hi> but negative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in a <hi>refuſal to act,</hi> in a manner deſtructive to them.</p>
            <p>LET me ſpeak plainly. In ſuch a cauſe to prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate or fear, is worſe, if poſſible, than falſhood or cowardiſe. Good breeding in private life, or good behavior in public life, can never require a deviation from truth or virtue. Our obligation to theſe, is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtent with us, and unchangeable. No other relation therefore can diſſolve or diminiſh the primary, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable duty.</p>
            <p>DO you believe, <hi>gentlemen,</hi> that parliaments never did, or never will do wrong? Do you profeſs an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility in politics, which you ridicule in religion? If any man ſhould tell the preſent parliament, they are all-wiſe and all-perfect, I am perſuaded, it would be eſteemed a wretched inſult both on their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and piety. Say they are the wiſeſt and juſteſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly on earth; and you ſay right. But human wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and human juſtice partake of human frailties. Such is the lot of our nature—and to beſtow the attributes of heaven on mortals, who to day are, and to-morrow are not, is the wildneſs of adulation.</p>
            <p>SURELY, you cannot perſevere in your error. If the <hi>ſtamp-act,</hi> DETESTABLE <hi>as you have deſcribed it,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not wake you from dreams of ſubmiſſion, yet is there no idea of danger or diſtreſs which your fancy can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to you, that you think would juſtify you in ſomething elſe than petitioning? Have you no "feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings" by which you might be tortured a little beyond
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010283_0015_0F7E713863B2EA80"/>
"remonſtrating?" <hi>I do not know what is dreadful to</hi> YOU, nor can I form the leaſt gueſs what would be ſo: but ſuppoſe to yourſelves an act of parliament commanding you to do or ſuffer ſomething the moſt dreadful in the world—to YOU: ſomething ten thouſand times more dreadful—to YOU I mean—than "oppreſſion beyond meaſure grievous"; "cruſhing juſtice under inſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able burthens;" or "ſinking the moſt valuable of all civil rights and liberties." Whatever that <hi>would be</hi> to <hi>you,</hi> the ſtamp act <hi>is</hi> to <hi>my countrymen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HERE permit me, <hi>gentlemen,</hi> to aſk, whether <hi>in ſuch a caſe</hi> you would "humbly ſubmit," tho it ſhould be in your power effectually to refuſe? To make your conduct conſiſtent with the ſentiments avowed in your letter, you muſt. Would you? Then, if what we are told of the antient <hi>Cappadocians</hi> be true, you would exhibit the ſecond inſtance ſince the creation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, of a people <hi>chuſing</hi> to be <hi>ſlaves.</hi> Would you refuſe? What then becomes of your "principle of loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty," and your "obedience to the laws of your mother country?" If ſo, they are only fine words, with which you intend to purchaſe ſome ſort of reputation with ſome ſort of people; you are then <hi>loyal</hi> and <hi>obedient,</hi> as you call yourſelves, <hi>becauſe you apprehend you can't ſafely be otherwiſe</hi>; and the pretended virtues you claim, like forced fruits, partake too ſtrongly of the manure that gave them growth, to afford any agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reliſh. Thus you reduce yourſelves to the miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able dilemma of making a choice between two of the meaneſt characters—of thoſe who <hi>would be ſlaves</hi> from <hi>inclination,</hi> tho they pretend to love liberty—and of thoſe who <hi>are dutiful</hi> from <hi>fear,</hi> tho they pretend to love ſubmiſſion.</p>
            <p>PARDON me, <hi>gentlemen,</hi> if I attribute to you the virtue, which your exceſſive modeſty diſclaims. Since
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:010283_0016_0F7E71392CC81C80"/>
you were deterred from reproaching, by the cautious conſideration, that you could not "<hi>reproach</hi> WITHOUT DANGER;" I am <hi>almoſt</hi> perſuaded, that you would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer refuſal to ſlavery, if you were aſſured, that you could "<hi>refuſe</hi> WITHOUT DANGER."</p>
            <p>YOU greatly injure me, <hi>gentlemen,</hi> if you imagine from what I have ſaid, that I am not a hearty friend to my king, his illuſtrious family, to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> or to the connexion between her and theſe colonies. In what I am now to ſay, I ſhall ſpeak not only my own, but the univerſal ſentiments of my countrymen. I am devoted to my gracious ſovereign, and his truly royal houſe, by principle and affection. They appear to me to have been called by providence to the throne; not to have gained it by the leaſt ſhare of the guilt, or even of the art, that has ſo often exalted the moſt unworthy to the moſt ſplendid ſtations. They have riſen with brightneſs upon the world, in due courſe, to ſhed bleſſings over mankind; and all hiſtory cannot furniſh an inſtance of a family, whoſe virtues have had a more auſpicious influence on the happineſs of men, particularly of their ſubjects. Their government does not afford only gleams of joy, but cheers with a flowing uniformity, except when ſome evil ſpirit interrupts our felicity— But theſe interruptions have never laſted: can never laſt, while princes of the line of <hi>Brunſwick</hi>
"chara deo ſoboles"
preſide over us. Their amiable qualities are heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; theſe render, if I may be allowed the expreſſion, our happineſs hereditary; and I might therefore be juſtly deemed very deficient in ſenſe or integrity, if it was not among my moſt ardent prayers, that the ſcepter of his dominions may be held by our preſent monarch and his family, till time ſhall be no more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:010283_0017_0F7E713A1728E8C8"/>AS to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> I glory in my relation to her. Every drop of blood in my heart is <hi>Britiſh</hi>; and that heart is animated with as warm wiſhes for her proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as her trueſt ſons can form. As long as this globe continues moving, may ſhe reign over it's navigable part; and may ſhe reſemble the ocean ſhe commands, which recruits without waſting, and receives without exhauſting, its kindred ſtreams in every climate. Are theſe the ſentiments of diſloyalty or diſaffection? Do theſe ſentiments point at independency? Can you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it? Will you aſſert it? I deteſt the thought with inexpreſſible abhorrence, for theſe reaſons; firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it would be undutiful to our ſovereign; ſecondly, becauſe it would be unjuſt to our mother-country; and thirdly, becauſe it would be deſtructive both to her and to us.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Britiſh</hi> nation is <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>generous.</hi> They can diſtinguiſh between a diſguſt to government and to the adminiſtration of it; a diſtinction, which bad miniſters are continually ſtriving to confound. <hi>They</hi> ſet up <hi>their paſſions</hi> for the intereſts of their king and country; and then, whoever is offended with their conduct, is convicted by a very plain deduction of miniſterial logic, of being an enemy to his king and country. No farmer diſlikes the ſun; but if it collects ſuch thick clouds as too much intercept its beams, ſurely the poor man who ſees all his hopes ſickening and withering, may very innocently diſlike the gloom, and wiſh the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving rays may be felt again. The <hi>Britiſh</hi> nation aims not at empire over vaſſals. And muſt, I am convinced, be better pleaſed to hear their children ſpeaking the language of freemen, than muttering the timid mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs of ſlaves. Can you believe, <hi>gentlemen</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they will be better pleaſed with the
<q>ſtile and ſubſtance of your repreſentation,</q>
than with the honeſt tranſports of <hi>North-American</hi> breaſts, ſo exactly like what <hi>they</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:010283_0018_0F7E713AB98478D8"/>
feel, when they think themſelves injured? If there is any people whoſe character it is, to ſubmit to wrongs, baſely pretending to prefer the pleaſure of thoſe who offer them, to their own welfare or honor, while cowardly hatred and malice lurk rankling and " heart-burning" in their boſoms, watching, wiſhing opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of dire revenge, it belongs not to <hi>Britons,</hi> or their true ſons. <hi>They</hi> can neither diſſemble injuries, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonably reſent them. Theſe are vices of little, cruel minds. Much better, much ſafer is it for all parties, particularly when we contend with noble ſpirits, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to ſpeak what we think, and thereby put it in their power—ſuch will always have it in their inclination— to give us ample ſatisfaction. They know that thoſe who are moſt ſenſible of injuries, are moſt ſenſible of benefits. There can be no friendſhip between freemen and ſlaves; and I have the ſtrongeſt hopes that our mutual affection will henceforward be more cement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than it hitherto has been —on their part, becauſe we have <hi>proved</hi> ourſelves worthy of their eſteem; and on our part, becauſe their generoſity will excuſe the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which we <hi>have proved it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SUPPOSE all this continent had imitated your exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and had repeated your doleful, doubtful notes, from one end of it to the other: had acknowledged upon their knees, "that they COULD NOT POSITIVELY SAY whether they were intitled to the exemption" they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, was there the leaſt probability of their obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it? I do not object to the probability, for want of juſtice or of affection towards us in our mother country; but for want of proper attention, which the artifices of our enemies in ſupport of their own darling mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, would always have prevented.</p>
            <p>EVERY man muſt remember, how immediately after the tempeſt of the late war was laid, another ſtorm began to gather over <hi>North-America.</hi> Every wind
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010283_0019_0F7E713B8643A728"/>
that blew acroſs the <hi>Atlantic,</hi> brought with it additional darkneſs. Every act of the adminiſtration ſeemed calculated to produce diſtreſs, and to excite terror. We were alarmed—we were afflicted. Many of our colonies ſent home petitions; others ordered their agents to make proper applications on their behalf. What was the effect? They were rejected without read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. They could not be preſented, "without break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through a rule of the houſe." They inſiſted upon a right, that, it "was <hi>previouſly</hi> determined, ſhould not be admitted." The language of the miniſtry was, "that <hi>they</hi> would teach the inſolent <hi>North-Americans,</hi> the reſpect due to the laws of their mother country." They moved for a reſolution "that the parliament could legally tax us." 'Twas made. For a bill— 'Twas framed. For its diſpatch—'Twas paſt. The badges of our ſhame were prepared—too groſs—too odious—even in the opinion of that adminiſtration, to be faſtened upon us by any but <hi>Americans.</hi> Strange de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion! to imagine that treachery could reconcile us to ſlavery. They looked around: they found <hi>Americans</hi>— O Virtue! they found <hi>Americans,</hi> to whom the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their country had committed the guardian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of her rights, on whom her bounty had beſtowed all—the wreck of her fortunes could afford, ready to rivet on their native land, the nurſe of their infancy, the protectrix of their youth, the honorer of their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, the fatal fetters which <hi>their information</hi> had help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to forge. <hi>They</hi> were to be gratifyed with part of the plunder in oppreſſive offices for themſelves and their creatures. By <hi>theſe,</hi> that <hi>they</hi> might reap the rewards of their corruption, were we adviſed—by <hi>theſe,</hi> that <hi>they</hi> might return <hi>maſters</hi> who went out <hi>ſervants,</hi> were we deſired— <hi>to put on the chains,</hi> and then with ſhackled hands <hi>to drudge in the dark,</hi> as well as we could, forgetting the <hi>light</hi> we had loſt. "IF I FORGET THEE, LET MY RIGHT HAND FORGET HER CUNNING—IF I DO NOT REMEMBER THEE, MAY MY TONGUE CLEAVE TO THE ROOF OF MY MOUTH."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:010283_0020_0F7E713C503D0738"/>WHEN the intelligence of theſe aſtoniſhing things reached <hi>America,</hi>
"then flam'd her ſpirit high."</p>
            <p>WHAT could ſhe do? ſend home petitions again? The firſt had been treated with contempt. What could be expected from a ſecond trial? We knew, that the humble petition of meek, pious, venerable biſhops, ſupplicating for the laws and religion of their country, had been called a falſe and ſeditious libel by a daring adminiſtration who were reſolved to have no law but their own pleaſure. We knew, that the liberty of our fellow ſubjects had been lately ſo boldly invaded even in our mother country, in that ſpot where the dignity of the empire may be ſaid more peculiarly to reſide, that their oppreſſors were hardly ſtopp'd in their career, by the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited voice of an injured and offended people. We knew, that the men who deſigned to oppreſs us, held up to thoſe whoſe aſſiſtance they were obliged to uſe, ſpecious pretences of immediate advantage, while every remoter miſchief, every diſagreeable truth was artfully conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them. They were perſuaded, that they were to promote their own intereſts, the public intereſts, by adopting the new-invented policy propoſed to them. In ſhort we knew, in what line every thought and act relating to us, ran. All was arbitrary, rigid, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening, dreadful. What reſourſe had we? We wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and wept—At laſt imploring the divine protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and appealing to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> goodneſs, we were driven by apprehenſion and affliction into a conduct, that might juſtly have rendered us to the humane rather objects of pity, than reſentment; but which you <hi>gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,</hi> are pleaſed to call a "REBELLIOUS oppoſition to authority."</p>
            <p>HOW much farther theſe colonies might have gone; how much farther it would have been proper for them to go, I will not pretend to ſay. I confine myſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010283_0021_0F7E713E13E794C0"/>
to <hi>your</hi> ſtate of the caſe, and to <hi>their</hi> behavior in that caſe. My ſoul ſickens at the ſcenes that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude themſelves on my imagination, while I reflect on what <hi>might</hi> have happened. My attention turns with unſpeakable pleaſure to thoſe brighter proſpects now * opening on my country, and the approaching times, when thro' the mercy of ALMIGHTY GOD, to whom be aſcribed everlaſting glory, the inhabitants of theſe colonies, animated with ſentiments of the moſt perfect gratitude, confidence, affection, and veneration, juſtly heightened by the engaging clemency of our amiable ſovereign, and the endearing tenderneſs of our mother country, ſhall be diligently and delightfully employed in demonſtrating, that they are not unworthy of the bleſſings beſtowed upon them. <hi>Great-Britain</hi> has been long diſtinguiſhed—ſhe muſt be now perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually celebrated, for her <hi>moderation.</hi> This is her peculiar praiſe. Other ſtates have been as great in arms; as learned in arts; but none ever equalled her in moderation—a virtue, and the parent of virtues.</p>
            <p>I AM very ſorry that theſe colonies had any reaſon given them to think they were right in going ſo far as they lately did: yet tho many things have been done, <hi>that</hi> I ſincerely wiſh had not been done, I ſhould be glad to know what particular part of their conduct has provoked you to iſſue, if I may uſe one of your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, ſo "ſevere a decree" againſt them.</p>
            <p>DID the reſolutions made by their ſeveral aſſemblies in vindication of their rights, deſerve ſuch a cenſure? You grant they were founded on truth and juſtice. Can it be criminal to maintain theſe? Perhaps you think they were guilty, in forming and perſiſting in their univerſal determination not to uſe ſtamped papers, as they were commanded to do. No man can be blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for doing any thing, which if he had not done, he
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010283_0022_0F7E713E892CD4C8"/>
muſt have committed a worſe action. Remember the opinion you have expresſed of the liberties for which theſe colonies were ſtruggling. Had they accepted the ſtamped papers, they would not only have betrayed themſelves, and you, whoſe proſperity they wiſh from a generoſity of temper, of which they hope you will hereafter give then more agreeable proofs, than you have yet done, but they would alſo have baſely betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ages yet unborn, to a condition that would have rendered their birth a curſe. You think "a memorial or memorials" would have relieved them, if they had "humbly ſubmitted;" that is, that injuries <hi>that</hi> could not be prevented by a regard to juſtice, liberty, and the happineſs of millions, might be redreſſed by well-penned petitions. No! The right would have been ſurrendered by our act—a precedent would have been eſtabliſhed by our acquieſcence, for perpetual <hi>ſervility.</hi> Where would the demands of miniſters, where would the miſeries of <hi>America</hi> have ſtopped?</p>
            <p>I BELIEVE your iſland and its neighbours have been more fortunate in "memorialiſing" than this continent. Had we any reaſon to expect relief from the conduct propoſed? Has any thing happened ſince, to ſhew that we ſhould have ſucceeded by it? Let any perſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ſpeeches lately made in parliament, and the reſolutions ſaid to be made there, notwithſtanding the convulſions occaſioned through the <hi>Britiſh empire</hi> by the <hi>oppoſition</hi> of theſe colonies to the ſtamp-act, and he may eaſily judge what would have been their ſituation, in caſe they had bent down and humbly taken up the burden prepared for them. What would have been their fate, ſince they have oppoſed, if one man the victor of his country's foreign and domeſtic foes, had not by his wiſdom and virtue checked the rage that decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might artfully have kind<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:010283_0023_0F7E713F1B983D50"/>WHEN the <hi>excluſion</hi> bill was depending in the houſe of commons, Col. <hi>Titus</hi> made this ſhort ſpeech—"Mr. ſpeaker, I hear a lion roaring in the lobby. Shall we ſecure the door, and keep him there: or ſhall we let him in <hi>to try</hi> if we can turn him out again."</p>
            <p>CAN it be poſſible, gentlemen, that our ſtopping on this continent the importation of goods from <hi>Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> has brought your reſentment upon us? If it has, it is the firſt time that induſtry and frugality have met with ſuch hard judges.</p>
            <p>THE only thing I can think of beſides, which might induce you to treat my countrymen as you have done, is the behavior of the mobs compoſed of the lower ranks of people in ſome <hi>few</hi> of the colonies, to thoſe who were favorers of the ſtamp-act— But ſurely that could not produce ſo <hi>general</hi> an accuſation of "your fellow-ſubjects on the northern continent." It was indeed a very improper way of acting; but may not theſe ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of minds <hi>not quite ſo poliſhed as your own,</hi> be in ſome meaſure excuſed? if as the abſolute monarch of <hi>Judea</hi> ſaid "oppreſſion maketh a wiſe man mad;" and if as the loyal committee of correſpondence in <hi>Barbados</hi> ſays, "the ſubverſion of juſtice" and "the moſt valuable of all civil rights and liberties" is "oppreſſion beyond meaſure grievous." It is needleſs to dwell longer on this head; but if you chuſe to enquire into the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of every mob that has happened here, taking for granted that the ſtamp-act is conſtitutional, I believe even you, on cool conſideration, would not term any of them a rebellion.</p>
            <p>UPON the whole, I acknowledge, that a regard to <hi>themſelves,</hi> has influenced the inhabitants of theſe colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; but it was not a regard void of the trueſt loyalty to <hi>their</hi> king, the warmeſt affection, the profoundeſt
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010283_0024_0F7E7142B75924C8"/>
veneration, for <hi>their</hi> parent country. If my father deceived and urged on by bad or weak men, ſhould offer me a draught of poiſon, and tell me it would be of ſervice to me, ſhould I be undutiful, if, knowing what it is I refuſe to drink it? or if inflamed by paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he ſhould aim a dagger at my heart, ſhould I be undutiful, if I refuſe to bare my breaſt for the blow? Should he complain, would it not be the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of <hi>Cataline,</hi> that the ſenator he attempted to aſſaſſinate, <hi>was ſo diſreſpectful to him, he</hi> WOULD NOT <hi>recieve the ſword in his body</hi>? Or ſhould I act like a man in his ſenſes, if I ſwallow the doſe or receive the ſtroke, in expectation that thoſe who prompted or provoked my father to the action, would afterwards give me a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain antidote or balſam—eſpecially, if they would probably get a large part of my eſtate? I will beg leave to trouble you, <hi>gentlemen,</hi> with one more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon. If a fortune of immenſe value comes into my poſſeſſion by being ſettled on me, as the lawful ſon of my father, which till then had been held ſolely by him, and my enemies ſhould perſuade my excellent parent to attempt to baſtardize me, and take the whole into his hands again, I not having the leaſt proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of happineſs without it, and he not having the leaſt occaſion for it—ſhould I be undutiful, if after endeavoring by intreaties to prevent his proceedings, I carefully record all the proofs of my being legitimate, ſtop the circulation of all falſe vouchers to the contrary, decline the correſpondence of thoſe who join with him, and even break the head of a man, who ſlanders my honour and my title, by ſpreading an opinion that I am baſely born? With how much leſs reaſon will the charge of undutifulneſs be made againſt me, if I have regularly advanced for my father all ſuch ſums as he has from time to time required, and have aſſured him by my profeſſions and behavior, that he ſhall have all the profits of the eſtate, allowing me a comfortable

maintenance, if he will ſuffer it to continue in my poſſeſſion—and all the world knows, that by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition annexed to this eſtate, I cannot part with it, without acknowledging myſelf to be a baſtard.</p>
            <p>TO conclude—<hi>gentlemen</hi>—I know none of you; not even one of your names. I mean no perſonal reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in this addreſs. I deteſt them. If you ſhould take any thing I have ſaid, ſo much in that way, as to feel uneaſineſs from it, I ſhall be very ſorry. Neither do I intend any reflections on your country, tho you repreſented <hi>her</hi> when you attacked <hi>mine.</hi> I always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted theſe looſe aſperſions, that ever give moſt pain to boſoms that honour and delicacy have rendered moſt ſenſible; and this deteſtation has been greatly encreaſed, ſince, within theſe few years, we have ſeen ſuch loads of obloquy thrown upon a <note n="*" place="bottom">The Scots.</note> nation, whoſe magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in bearing them will be ſufficient I hope, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them the eſteem of thoſe, who have been ſo much blinded by paſſion, as to deny it to their other nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous virtues and accompliſhments. Your iſland is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable. Your private characters may be amiable: but in a public capacity, you have caſt a moſt high and unprovoked cenſure on a gallant, generous, loyal people. You have propagated a ſet of ſentiments, and have promoted a tenor of conduct, that may be hurtful to the cauſe of freedom. I have engaged with too unequal arms perhaps, to oppoſe you; but to <hi>fail</hi> in ſuch a conteſt, will afford me ſome kind of pleaſure. I wiſh you every bleſſing that men can enjoy; and as a foundation and ſecurity of all the reſt, I wiſh you a true love of liberty.</p>
