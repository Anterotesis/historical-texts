            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PSALM CVII. 26.</bibl>
               <q>THEY <hi>mount up to heaven; they go down again to the depths; their ſoul is melted becauſe of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE paſſage I have read to you, is a deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſtorm, and the effects of it, upon the minds of mariners.</p>
            <p>I truſt I need not make an apology for ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently addreſſing you upon this affecting ſubject. The repeated heavy ſtrokes, we have felt, call for our deepeſt humiliation, and therefore for our frequent meditations upon ſuch awakening providences.</p>
            <p>We rejoice, my brethren, to ſee ſo many of you returned to us, after all the dangers you have eſcaped, and when ſo many of your companions have been ſwallowed up in the ocean, whoſe faces we ſhall ſee no more, till the ſea ſhall give up the dead that are in it.—We rejoice eſpecially to behold you "in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the people (of God), and in the aſſembly of the elders." We hope the end of your approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the houſe of God is "to praiſe him for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011939_0003_0F877B3199141310"/>
for his wonderful works to the children of men, and his providential deliverances of you in particular.</p>
            <p>To you eſpecially I addreſs my diſcourſe, and may the Father of mercies grant the deſired effect.</p>
            <p>"They mount up to heaven; they go down again to the depths; their ſoul is melted becauſe of trouble."</p>
            <p>We who dwell on ſhore, your fathers, your wives and children, often feel for you in ſuch tempeſtuous ſeaſons, and make your dangers our own. We are deprived of reſt by day, and of ſleep by night, and are ready to conclude, that no employment is ſo la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious, and no dangers are ſo great, as thoſe of the the ſeas; and that, if poſſible, ſome other method of ſubſiſtence ſhall be purſued for the future. This, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, is but a concluſion drawn up in haſte, without weighing the matter.</p>
            <p>There is no calling in life but has its difficulties and troubles. Thoſe on the land complain of the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of ſubſiſting their families, and will frequently exchange their callings in order to follow the ſea. Since the apoſtacy from God, trials and dangers are neceſſary for us; and as each occupation has its plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, ſo each has its ſorrows and burdens too. Tho' following the ſea has the greateſt proportion of danger and ſorrow, the wiſe Ruler of the world has balanced it with (perhaps) greater advantages and pleaſures. When the ſea-man determines upon his voyage, future troubles, if they enter his mind, leave no more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion there, than the ſhip, in which he fails, does of her path upon the ocean; and he is chearful and gay to a proverb.</p>
            <p>With regard to you who are employed in the fiſhery,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011939_0004_0F877B326B312100"/>
a large proportion of your time is ſpent on ſhore, and providence gives you the opportunity of rejoicing with your families and friends; an interview, the delights of which are ſweetened by abſence and long ſeparation from each other.</p>
            <p>When the winter is over and gone, weary of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active life, and in hopes of ſucking of the abundance of the ſeas, you long to depart. Joy ſits upon every countenance at the alacrity with which you exert your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in preparing for your voyage; and if heaven ſmiles upon your undertaking, none have more cauſe to rejoice than yourſelves. A moderate ſeaſon, a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant ſun, and fair winds, haſten your preparation. The time at laſt arrives, and your wives and children, with tears of tenderneſs, take their leave. You weigh an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, and ſet ſail, while the multitude give you their bleſſing, and pray for your ſucceſsful return.</p>
            <p>You have now launched forth upon the wide and boiſterous ocean, and there is an uncertainty in all worldly affairs, and trouble may come upon you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you are aware.</p>
            <p>"The God in whoſe hand your breath is, and whoſe are all your ways," has the command of the wind and of the ſeas. In order to convince men of their dependance on him, he ſhoots many arrows from his quiver at thoſe who dwell on the land. This you have been moſt ſenſibly affected with, when, upon your late return, you found ſo many of your dear children not only wounded, but ſlain by them.<note n="*" place="bottom">A mortal ſickneſs prevailed among the children.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Storms and tempeſts are his uſual methods of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof and puniſhment to thoſe who do buſineſs on the mighty waters. I have obſerved to you, that my
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:011939_0005_0F877B32E7532380"/>
text deſcribes a ſtorm, and ſhows us how mariners are affected with it. Ah! how altered? we can ſcarcely believe they are the ſame men!</p>
            <p>Whatever reaſon may ſuggeſt would be the conduct of thoſe who behold the wonders of God in the deep, experience muſt force us to own the too melancholy truth, that of all men they are moſt addicted to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation and conduct, which every rational creature ought to avoid as its bane. We are ſorry to ſay, that oaths and profaneneſs abound among them, which in ſome is carried to ſuch a length as to place themſelves, as it were, in the throne of God, dealing out his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as though they had "an arm like God, and could thunder with a voice like him."</p>
            <p>No wonder the children of ſuch parents imitate their vices, and when they return from their voyages have learnt to curſe and damn their younger brothers. Theſe are the youth that are to act upon the ſtage when we are dead and gone! theſe are the children that have been given up to God in baptiſm, and whom their parents have moſt ſolemnly vowed, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God and man, to bring up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord! Oh! publiſh it not in Gath! proclaim it not in Aſkelon! bleſſed be God that this is not more common among us, and that ſo many of our children remember their creator in the days of their youth.</p>
            <p>To return to my text, "They mount up to heaven; they go down again to the depths; their ſoul is melted becauſe of trouble." The ſky, which looked ſerene and fair, gathers blackneſs: The winds, which were moderate, riſe and blow with violence: The ſea, which was as ſmooth as glaſs, toſſes its waves moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:011939_0006_0F877B33AC004458"/>
high: The night comes on: The ſtorm increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: The winds rage: The rain beats upon you, and the ſea is ready to ſwallow you up: "you reel to and fro, and ſtagger like a drunken man;" "are at your wit's end," and "your ſouls melt within you becauſe of trouble." Oh! who can deſcribe how great that trouble is? your hearts can paint it in more lively colours than I am capable of. This, however, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that different tempers are affected different ways, according to their peculiar circumſtances.</p>
            <p>In proſecuting this ſubject, I ſhall enumerate ſome of thoſe troubles, under which your hearts were ready to melt, and then ſhow the improvement you ought to make of theſe things.</p>
            <p>"Doubtleſs you were not unaffected with the troubles, which you ſaw your neighbours, your friends and your relations in." Though your own troubles were great, yet when you ſaw them toſſed up to heaven, then ſinking into the depths, your hearts were filled with ſorrow for them. On one ſide of you, was a near and dear companion; on the other ſide, a kind father, or a beloved ſon; or, it may be, many rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and friends in the ſame veſſel. They put out ſignals of diſtreſs, importuning your aſſiſtance, but importuning it in vain. Or they might be ſo near as to call to you, and in the bitterneſs of their ſouls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, in God's name, and in the name of Chriſt, to lend them ſome aſſiſtance. Oh ſave us! we periſh! we all periſh!—When men are brought into ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities as theſe, they ſeldom think how little their friends are able to do for them; and though they have called in vain, they call again and again, and cannot take a denial! Oh how muſt your hearts melt within
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011939_0007_0F877B3456A948E8"/>
you! how muſt your bowels yearn towards them—you cry in diſtreſs and agony, <q>Behold! they ſink! they are gone—gone to the bottom! Lord have mercy on them! Oh! what will become of their poor ſouls: they are going into the preſence of the ſupreme judge—into his preſence, before whom we ourſelves may ſoon appear. The next ſea may prove as fatal to us. Oh! what wretches we are? how unfit to appear before the tribunal of God—how unworthy of his mercy?—Theſe (perhaps ſome of you might have reaſon to ſay within your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) were our companions in ſin: and Oh! what lives have we lived together? how often have we been companions in drunkenneſs—companions in debauchery—companions in ſabbath-breaking, in gaming, and in profane ſwearing? We have curſed and damned one another, and dared the Almighty to execute his threatened vengeance upon us. Oh! what has become of my companions, and what will become of me?</q> In this reſpect your ſouls have been ready to melt within you.</p>
            <p>Another of you may have thus reflected within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: <q>Alas! my child, my dear child, is gone, clean gone for ever! had I ſet a good example before him, had I inſtructed him in the principles of the chriſtian religion, and had I prayed to God for him, the circumſtances of his death would have been leſs ſhocking;</q> and we truſt, my brethren, that this has been the caſe with ſome of you, and that you have good hope and chriſtian conſolation in the death of your children; but this is far from being the caſe with wicked parents of wicked children, (we hope there are but few ſuch.) Oh how muſt their hearts melt within them, when they are ſnatched away from
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011939_0008_0F877B351723D400"/>
their eyes in ſo ſudden a manner! "O my ſon Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom, my ſon, my ſon Abſalom; would God I had died for thee, O Abſalom, my ſon, my ſon!"</p>
            <p>"Again, the hearts of others of you were ready to melt within you becauſe of trouble of another kind." It is more than probable that your dangers reminded you of the circumſtances of your families at home. Thoſe, whom we tenderly love, are not eaſily forgot. It is reported of a pirate, that before he would ſuffer any man, who was ſo unhappy as to fall into his hands, to be put to death, he firſt enquired of him, have you a wife or children on ſhore? if he anſwered in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative, I alſo, ſays he, with tears in his eyes, have a wife and one dear child, and for their ſakes I forgive you, go in peace. If perſons of ſo abandoned a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter are not diveſted of natural affection, we may with reaſon expect the moſt tender emotions in thoſe who have not run to ſuch exceſs of wickedneſs. When you were in trouble for yourſelves, it is probable, among other things, you were in trouble for your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies. You wiſhed you could have one more inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view with them. <q>Oh! my dear wife, my dear lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle children, that I could but once ſee you again! never would I grieve my companion by a profane or wicked conduct, but live with her as a joint heir of the grace of life! Oh my dear children, that I could but ſee you again, to counſel and warn you, to inſtruct and pray to God for you; but wretch that I am, what will my prayers avail, who have neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected this duty all my life long till now that God has over whelmed my ſoul with ſorrow? Oh that my family knew my diſtreſs, but I muſt be ſnatched from them without an opportunity to take my laſt
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011939_0009_0F877B35D88B7280"/>
farewell! there are but a few hours between me and eternity! may God be a father to my poor father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs children, and a huſband to my widow!</q>—In this reſpect your ſouls have been ready to melt within you.</p>
            <p>"Again, many of you have been in trouble, more eſpecially for your own ſouls." When men are in proſperity, they are apt to be forgetful of God. Young perſons, in particular, are prone to rejoice in their youth, and to walk after the imagination of their own hearts, and ſight of their own eyes. I fear this has been the caſe with many of you. You have drank in iniquity like water, and tempted your companions to the ſame conduct, and wondered that they would not "run to the ſame exceſs of riot." When you did theſe things, God kept ſilence. He did not frown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you in his providence; and becauſe ſentence was not executed upon you, your hearts were fully ſet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you to do wickedly; but now the voice of this providence to you is this, "thou fool, this night thy ſoul ſhall be required of thee", and you are reminded, in a moſt affecting manner, "that for all theſe things God will bring you into judgment."</p>
            <p>Once you thought the Lord did not ſee, neither did the God of Jacob regard it. The ſins you kept ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret from men, you vainly imagined were ſecreted from God alſo.</p>
            <p>Once you thought there was time enough to repent of the follies of youth; and when you were reminded of the uncertainty of life, and certainty of death, and were urged to ſeek an intereſt in Chriſt, your language was, go your way for this time, at a more convenient ſeaſon I will hear you of this matter.</p>

Chriſt and all his glories were ſet before you, and you have often heard it declared in this aſſembly, from the ſacred bible, by the ambaſſadors of Chriſt, in a moſt ſolemn manner, "he that believeth, and is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, ſhall be ſaved;" and "he that believeth, not, ſhall be damned;" but neither the hopes of ſalvation, nor the fears of damnation, made any abiding im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on your ſinful hearts.</p>
            <p>Your parents prayed (we hope) in ſecret to God for you, and reproved you with tears of pity in their eyes; but you hated inſtruction, and would none of their reproof. You thought there was no occaſion of troubling yourſelves about theſe things, and that you ſhould eſcape as well as others, though you never ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly conſidered how: But now you find your miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, and that "it is a moſt fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God."</p>
            <p>"You mount up to heaven; you go down again to the depths: Your ſoul is melted becauſe of trouble." Every ſea you ſhip makes your condition more and more dreadful: You throw the veſſel up, to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the wind and waves, and let her drive. Oh! the anguiſh of ſuch poor ſouls! recollect your own thoughts in ſuch ſeaſons of diſtreſs. <q>Oh what a life have I lived? what a poor thoughtleſs creature have I been? how little value have I ſet upon my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and immortal ſoul? but now, ah now! I ſee it is of more value than a thouſand worlds! Oh that I had but one hour more to live, that I might repent, that I could hear one more goſpel ſermon, and have one more offer of Chriſt; but it is too late for me, for my days are near finiſhed, and I am going to give up an account of myſelf to God—an
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011939_0011_0F877B3835CD7000"/>
account of my miſpent time—of my abuſed privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of all my talents! Oh how ſhall I hold up my head? how ſhall I meet my judge? how ſhall I anſwer him for one of a thouſand of my ſins, when I ſtand before his tribunal?</q>
            </p>
            <p>In this diſtreſs and bitterneſs of ſoul, you cried unto the Lord. If you never prayed before, you then prayed and cried, and beſought the Lord to have mercy upon you, though at the eleventh hour! Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah's mariners, though heathen, called upon their gods; and doubtleſs you called upon the God of heaven, whom the winds and ſeas obey; and you called upon him in a moſt importunate manner.—<q>Lord have mercy on us, Lord ſave us, we periſh! Oh ſpare our lives. We will repent, we will reform, a will forſake our ſins! Oh have mercy on us: for Chriſt's ſake, ſave our ſouls. Lord Jeſus, have mercy on us!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Well, my brethren, God has delivered you out of all theſe troubles. When you cried unto him in your troubles, and he brought you out of your diſtreſs, "he made the ſtorm a calm, ſo that the waves thereof were ſtill." Then you were glad, becauſe you were quiet, ſo he has brought you to your deſired haven;" and here you are, this day, preſent before the Lord, in his houſe!</p>
            <p>Oh look around in this aſſembly, and ſee—Oh! where are your companions gone? Where are thoſe who frequented this houſe of worſhip? Where are thoſe that were your companions in diverſion at home, and afterwards your companions in ſorrow and trouble?

—<note n="*" place="bottom">By as correct an account as could be taken, which was publiſhed in the Eſſex Gazette, January 2, 1770, it appears, that from January 1768, to January 1770, this town has loſt 23 fail of veſſels, and all the men belonging to them, amounting to 162, beſides a conſiderable number who were waſhed over from veſſels that returned. They have left 70 widows, and 155 children.—The loſs of intereſt was computed to be £. 14124-8-5, L. M.</note> Upwards of one hundred and fifty of them are gone to their long home, who have left ſixty ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful widows, and one hundred and thirty-three father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs children, many of whom are in want of bread: And it is a day of darkneſs with us ſtill! We know not, but have reaſon to fear, that others are added to this number. How affecting is that paſſage of Iſai. v. 25. if applied to our caſe? "The anger of the Lord is kindled againſt his people, and he hath ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth his hand againſt them, and hath ſmitten them; but for all this, his anger is not turned away, but his hand is ſtretched out ſtill!"</p>
            <p>You who have returned to us, have more than double reaſon to remember the diſpenſations of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence towards this place. Your hearts muſt ſtill feel the impreſſions that were made upon them, when you were abroad; and now you are at home, wherever you turn your eyes, you muſt be reminded of what God has delivered you from. You are in particular this day reminded of all theſe things—of your dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers—of your vows—of the bitterneſs of your ſouls, and of the goodneſs of God in bringing you to your deſired haven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:011939_0013_0F877B3A7AD318E8"/>
Oh that we could ſo remind you of theſe things as to ſpeak not only to your ears, but to your hearts! we would "impart to you, not the goſpel of God only, but our own ſouls." Permit me, on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to uſe the words of the Apoſtle, "My little children, we travail in birth again, 'till Chriſt be formed in your ſouls." Oh let us not labour in vain, and ſpend our ſtrength for nought. See therefore thoſe paſſages of ſcripture in Jerem. vii. 2, 3. connected with 1 Chron. xxviii. 9. "Hear the word of the Lord, all ye of Judah that enter in at theſe gates to worſhip the Lord. Thus faith the Lord of Hoſts, the God of Iſrael, amend your ways and your doings, and I will cauſe you to dwell in this place. Know thou the God of thy father, and ſerve him with a perfect heart."—"If thou ſeek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forſake him, he will caſt thee off forever."—Oh, therefore, "praiſe the Lord for his goodneſs, exalt him in the congregation of the people, and praiſe him in the aſſembly of the elders."</p>
            <p>It is obſerved in 1 Pet. iii. 19. that Chriſt "preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſpirits that were in priſon," that is, he preached to thoſe that were then dead, by Noah, whom he inſpired to be a preacher of righteouſneſs, giving warning to the old world of the judgments of God that were approaching. You may remember, that, in my farewell diſcourſe to you, I had ſuch a paſſage as this: <q>You are now upon a dangerous voyage. God only knows who of you will ever return.—Your wives may ſoon become widows, and your children, fatherleſs. Should this be the caſe, it would not be uncommon. We hope for the beſt, but prepare yourſelves for the worſt. As ſoon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:011939_0014_0F877B3C05EB8890"/>
your compaſs as your bible. It will direct you to Chriſt. It is Chriſt that is the propitiation for ſin. It muſt be Chriſt in you, the hope of glory.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Many of thoſe, to whom theſe words were addreſſed, are now dead and gone—gone to the world of ſpirits, and they know the vaſt importance of an intereſt in the Redeemer's purchaſe; and was it poſſible for the dead to preach to the living, they would declare to you, that without an intereſt in Chriſt you are eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally undone! and oh how importunate would they be with you, to embrace the goſpel offers of Chriſt, who giveth eternal life to as many as believe! You will find the goſpel as true, as tho' your friends aroſe from the dead, appeared in this aſſembly, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to you. Suffer me then to urge your acceptance of an offered Saviour: accept of him as your prophet, as your prieſt, and as your king. The well being of your ſouls for a vaſt eternity depends upon this. Oh think not that, as your dangers are over and paſt, you may be as thoughtleſs and ſecure as ever; for the time may come, when that dreadful threatening, Prov. i. 24. and onwards, may be executed upon you: "Becauſe I have called, and ye have refuſed, I have ſtretched out my hand, and no man regarded; but ye have ſet at nought my council, and would none of my reproof; I alſo will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; when your fear cometh as deſolation, and your deſtruction as a whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind; when diſtreſs and anguiſh come upon you, then ſhall ye call upon me, but I will not anſwer; ye ſhall ſeek me early, but ye ſhall not find me."</p>
            <p>Connected with faith in Chriſt, is a reformation of life. "If any man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature:"
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011939_0015_0F877B3C95EDCCD0"/>
And have you not reſolved, and this with tears and vows, that you would reform and live as new men? Perform now unto the Lord your vows—the vows and promiſes you made when your ſouls were melted with ſorrow. If you forget them, God will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, for they are all wrote down in his book—in that book which will be opened, when the dead, ſmall and great, ſhall ſtand before God, and be judged out of thoſe things which are written in the books according to their works.</p>
            <p>I know, my brethren, the temptations you labour under. Should you but mention it to your compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, that you intend for the future to live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly, in this preſent evil world, they would laugh you to ſcorn, and you would have a trial of cruel mocking; for if they called the maſter of the houſe Belzebub, much more thoſe of his houſhold. But though you may be derided as religious fools, we hope you will diſdain their frowns. A companion of, fools ſhall be deſtroyed. "Oh my ſoul, come not thou into their ſecret; mine honor, unto their aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be not thou united."</p>
            <p>We hope we ſhall hear no more curſing or profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, from your mouths; but that you will rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove thoſe, whoſe tongues are "full of deadly poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon," who, when they "bleſs God, even the father, curſe men who are made after the ſimilitude of God."</p>
            <p>Inſtead of ſpending your time in thoſe unmanly games, which diſgrace our children in the ſtreets, we truſt you will be ſeriouſly concerned for the ſalvation of your ſouls.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:011939_0016_0F877B3E9B3827A8"/>
Live with your companions as joint heirs of the grace of life. Worſhip God in your houſes, and bring up your children in the fear of God, inſtructing them in the doctrines of the goſpel, praying to God for them, and ſetting a good example before them; and may God grant, you and them, his ſalvation.</p>
            <p>All in this aſſembly, both huſbands and wives, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and children, maſters and ſervants, ought to make a ſuitable improvement of theſe diſpenſations of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence. We have, all of us, to perform the voyage of life. We have embarked, weighed anchor, and ſet ſail, and are bound to eternity. We are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to rocks and to quickſands, to ſtorms and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts. God grant that none of us make ſhipwreck of a good conſcience, left we ſuffer the loſs, not of our lives only, but of our ſouls.</p>
            <p>We truſt you will be as pilots to your brethren, who, though they have eſcaped deſtruction by the ſtorms at ſea, are expoſed to another kind of ſtorm,—to a ſtorm of temptation. You will caution them againſt their danger; you will councel, adviſe and aſſiſt them.</p>
            <p>The widows and children of thoſe, whoſe huſbands and fathers have literally ſuffered ſhipwreck, are not inſenſible of your kindneſs, in your intended liberality to them, this day. They will riſe up and call you bleſſed. It is not to them, alone, you give; it is to the father of the fatherleſs, to the huſband and judge of the widow. Humility indeed is afraid to indulge the thought! "When ſaw I thee hungry or thirſty, or naked, or ſick, or in priſon, and miniſtred unto thee?" To whom our Lord replies, Inaſmuch as ye
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011939_0017_0F877B3F45436D68"/>
have done it to one of the leſt of theſe my diſciples, ye have done it unto me." The mite of a poor wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow ſhall be remembered to the end of the world, and "a cup of cold water only, given to a diſciple, in the name of a diſciple, ſhall not loſe its reward."</p>
            <p>The loſſes you have ſuſtained, I know, are heavy; the town having ſuffered £. 12-944-1-6, beſides what has been added ſince this account was taken; but you will remember what the Apoſtle ſays to the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, 2 Cor. viii. 1. when he was forwarding a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution for the poor Chriſtians of Judea: He recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends to them, the example of the Macedonians, in theſe words: "Brethren, we do you to wit, (or we inform you,) of the grace of God, beſtowed on the churches of Macedonia; how that, in a great trial of affliction, the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty, abounded unto the riches of their liberality, for unto their power, (I bear record) yea, and beyond their power, they were willing of themſelves"—wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to do the moſt generous things for the good of their fellow chriſtians in want—willing without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties and importunity. Let us remember that "he who ſoweth ſparingly, ſhall reap alſo ſparingly; and he who ſoweth bountifully, ſhall reap alſo boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully."</p>
            <p>We hope, brethren, that your zeal will provoke very many, when our circumſtances are more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally known. Contributions in the churches were common even in the days of the Apoſtles. "Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miniſtring to the ſaints, it is ſuperfluous, ſays he, for me to write to you. I ſhall not attempt to excite you to forward this, for I know the readineſs of your minds.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:011939_0018_0F877B40F05F54D0"/>
May God humble us under the heavy ſtrokes of his providence. We have been a moſt provoking peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. May we be ſo humbled under his mighty hand, that "in his own due time we may be exalted."—Whatever our outward circumſtances are, happy ſhall we be, if we fly to the hope ſet before us in the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which, as in Heb. vi. 19, with which I conclude, "is as an anchor to the ſoul, both ſure and ſteadfaſt, entering into that within the vail."</p>
