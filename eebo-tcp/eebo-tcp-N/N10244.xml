            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>A SERMON Preached before the Incorporated SOCIETY FOR THE <hi>Propagation of the Goſpel in Foreign Parts;</hi> AT THEIR ANNIVERSARY MEETING IN THE Pariſh Church of ST. MARY-LE-BOW, On FRIDAY <hi>February</hi> 19, 1773.</p>

            <p>THE following SERMON, printed in <hi>London,</hi> and re-printed in <hi>Boſton,</hi> is admirably well adapted to lead thoſe, who may think proper to read it, into juſt Sentiments of the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>policy</hi> of the Britiſh Miniſtry in their conduct towards the Colonies, and of the only effectual method they can take to promote that love, harmony, peace, and mutual confidence, without which neither <hi>England,</hi> nor <hi>America,</hi> can be truly happy. It has been highly ſpoken of, by the beſt writers on the ſide of Liberty, in the public Papers at home, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the peruſal of all, who have at heart the real wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the <hi>whole</hi> Britiſh Empire, and not a detached part of it only. As it was preached by a Lord Biſhop, and before ſo great and reſpectable a Body as the honorable Society for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating the Goſpel, it will, doubtleſs, be thought eminently worthy of the attention of <hi>Epiſcopalians</hi> in this part of the world; eſpecially, as it may reaſonably be ſuppoſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the real ſentiments of that Society, who have give their thanks to the preacher of this Sermon, and deſired its publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation for the common good. Some parts of this Sermon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late peculiarly to the affairs of the Society before whom it was preached; for which reaſon, thoſe parts of the Sermon might have been omitted: but it was judged expedient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print the <hi>whole,</hi> leſt it ſhould be ſaid, detached paſſages only were ſelected, and others ſuppreſſed, with a view to ſerve a turn.</p>

            <head>A SERMON Before the Society for the Propagation of the Goſpel.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>LUKE CHAP. ii. VER. 14.</bibl>
               <q>Glory be to God in the higheſt, and on Earth Peace, good will towards Men.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>I KNOW no paſſage in the holy ſcriptures, that may be adapted with more propriety to our preſent meeting, than this declaration from the angel of the gracious purpoſes of Heaven in publiſhing the Goſpel. That which was the deſign of the goſpel itſelf muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be the chief object of a Society inſtituted to propagate it. The generous office, we have undertaken, is by inſtructing diſtant countries in religious truths to promote the peace and happineſs of mankind. It is by ſuch actions that the holy ſcriptures allow the ſons of men to conſider themſelves as glorifying God; and ſuch, we are aſſured, are the moſt likely to obtain his favour and good will to men. Without entering into a farther explication of the words, ſuffer me to deſire that you will keep in your minds the general principle contained in them; and you will find it eaſily applicable to the facts, the circumſtances, and the different ſituations of things,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:013009_0004_0F8FB13D4D025280"/>
which I ſhall take leave to mention<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as being more or leſs connected with the credit and influence of this Society.</p>
            <p>The firſt object of our zeal was the converſion of the Indians; and it ſhould ſeem no difficult taſk to influence the minds of men, who have few religious notions of their own growth, and appear to have no ſtrong prejudices in favour of them Such minds one would think might eaſily be led to receive a religion of the moſt ſimple form, conſiſting of a few great luminous principles, and incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating plain rules of life and conduct, which muſt approve their uſefulneſs in deſarts, as well as in cities. Such doctrines founded on Divine authority, would, in all appearance be particularly welcome, where the reſtraints of law and government have but little force. Yet it has happened contrary to our hopes, that the preaching of the goſpel has been of ſmall efficacy amongſt the Indians. The ſagacity for which they are remarkable ſeems to be of a partial kind, and to partake more of inſtinct than of reaſon. They can employ great art to obtain their ends; to procure what they deſire; or to gain a ſuperiority over an enemy; but their paſſions and habits proceeding al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in one narrow track, they have neither reliſh nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment for the cleareſt truths, to which they have not been accuſtomed. After ſhewing the greateſt addreſs and courage in ſubduing or ſurpriſing an enemy, they cannot comprehend that it would be generous not to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture him; and that it would be wiſe to give ſuch treatment as they would wiſh to receive. They have beſides an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tameable ſavage ſpirit, which has refuſed to hear the voice of inſtruction; which has obſtinately rejected the arts and improvements of the Europeans, and has hitherto only adopted the moſt beaſtly of their vices.</p>
            <p>For theſe reaſons, though we ought not to remit our endeavours, yet I fear we have little reaſon to hope for their converſion, till ſome great change in their manners
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:013009_0005_0F8FB13DF15760D0"/>
has made them abandon their ſavage vagrant life, and prepared them for the diſcipline of law and religion.</p>
            <p>But a more promiſing field is opened to our hopes, in the populous provinces of our own colonies. The rapid increaſe of their numbers on every ſide, in a country where the means of ſubſiſtence are eaſy and open, together with the perpetual acceſſion of inhabitants from Europe are continually forming new congregations. Now know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all kinds will probably be rare amongſt men who are entering into the firſt rudiments of ſociety; and while their attention is bent on procuring the neceſſaries of life, it is not to be expected that they ſhould be either diligent or ſucceſsful in the improvement of religious knowledge. Here therefore the inſtructions that are conveyed to them by the liberality of this Society, may be of eſſential and durable ſervice. This is ſowing the good ſeed in a fruitful ſoil; and what is ſo planted may produce returns of an hundred fold, and afford fruit and nouriſhment to future generations. Allow me to indulge a little the pleaſure of contemplating to proſpect the good that may reſult in after times from this our labour of love.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the annals of hiſtory have never afforded a more grateful ſpectacle to a benevolent and philoſophick mind than the growth and progreſs of the Britiſh colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in North America. We ſee a number of ſcattered ſettlements, formed at firſt for the purpoſes of trade, or from a ſpirit of enterprize; to procure a maintenance, or to enjoy the exerciſe of their religion, <hi>which in thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy days was refuſed them at home,</hi> growing by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, under the protection of their mother country, who treated them with the indulgence due to their weakneſs and infancy, into little ſeperate common-wealths. Placed in a climate, that ſoon became fruitful and healthy by their induſtry; poſſeſſing that liberty which was the <hi>natural growth of their own country,</hi> and ſecured by her
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013009_0006_0F8FB14199A6B238"/>
power againſt foreign enemies, they ſeem to have been intended, as a ſolitary experiment, to inſtruct the world to what improvements and happineſs mankind will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally attain, when they are ſuffered to uſe their own prudence, in ſearch of their own intereſt. I muſt repeat it again as an obſervation not unworthy of this audience and this occaſion, that there is no inſtance in the records of time, where infant colonies have been treated with ſuch a juſt and liberal indulgence.</p>
            <p>Had theſe ſettlements been left to ſhift for themſelves, they would have periſhed and been ſwept away by the rough courſe of accidents, like ſeeds that are ſcattered by the winds, of which not one in a thouſand take root and come to maturity. Had they been planted by any king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom but our own, the inhabitants would have carried with them the chains and oppreſſion, to which they had been inured at home: they would have been ſubject to the ſchemes of miniſters and favourites, and have ſuffered more from their ignorance than from their rapine. At beſt they could only have hoped to be conſidered as the live ſtock upon a lucrative farm, which might ſometimes be ſuffered to thrive for the ſake of it's produce.</p>
            <p>But Britain from the beginning has treated her colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in a very different manner. She has not ſold them her protection at the price of their liberty; ſhe has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been ready to encourage their induſtry, to relieve their wants, and to revenge their injuries; and has ſought no other advantage from ſo generous a conduct, but the mutual benefit ariſing to diſtant countries from the ſupply of each other's wants. Adhering to theſe maxims, ſhe has continued to reap the fruits of her own wiſdom and moderation in a ſurpriſing encreaſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional greatneſs; while her proſperous colonies are ſpreading without interruption over a vaſt continent, that may in a few centuries rival the commerce, the arts and the power of Europe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:013009_0007_0F8FB142CB75B740"/>
It is difficult for man to look into the deſtiny of future ages, the deſigns of Providence are too vaſt and compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and our own powers are too narrow, to admit of much ſatisfaction to our curioſity. But when we ſee many great and powerful cauſes conſtantly at work, we cannot doubt of their producing proportionable effects. The colonies in North America have not only taken root and acquired ſtrength; but ſeem haſtening with an accelerated progreſs to ſuch a powerful ſtate, as may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce a new and important change in human affairs. Deſcended from anceſtors of the moſt improved and enlightened part of the old world, they receive as it were by inheritance all the improvements and diſcoveries of their mother-country. And it happens fortunately for them to commerce their flouriſhing ſtate at a time when the human underſtanding has attained to the free uſe of it's powers, and has learned to act with vigour and certainty. They may avail themſelves not only of the experience and induſtry, but even of the errors and miſtakes of former days. Let it be conſidered for how many ages great part of the world appears not to have thought at all; how many more they have been buſied in forming ſyſtems and conjectures; while reaſon has been loſt in a labyrinth of words, and they never ſeem to have ſuſpected, on what frivolous matters their minds were employed. And let it be well underſtood, what rapid improvements, what important diſcoveries have been made in a few years, by a few countries, with our own at their head which have at laſt diſcovered the right method of uſing their faculties. May we not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably expect that a number of provinces, poſſeſſed of theſe advantages, and quickened by mutual emulation, with only the common progreſs of the human mind, ſhould very conſiderably enlarge the boundaries of ſcience. The vaſt continent itſelf, over which they are gradually ſpreading, may be conſidered as a treaſure, yet untouched
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013009_0008_0F8FB143867FC1E0"/>
of natural productions, that ſhall hereafter afford ample matter for commerce and contemplation. And if we reflect what a ſtock of knowledge may be accumulated by the conſtant progreſs of induſtry and obſervation, fed with freſh ſupplies from the ſtores of nature, aſſiſted ſometimes by thoſe happy ſtrokes of chance, which mock all the powers of invention, and ſometimes by thoſe ſuperior characters which ariſe occaſionally to inſtruct and enlighten the world; it is difficult even to imagine to what heighth of improvement their diſcoveries may extend.</p>
            <p>And perhaps they may make as conſiderable advances in the arts of civil government and the conduct of life.</p>
            <p>We have reaſon to be proud, and even jealous, of our excellent conſtitution. But thoſe equitable principles on which it was formed, an equal repreſentation,(the beſt diſcovery of political wiſdom) and a juſt and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious diſtribution of power, which with us were the price of civil wars, and the reward of the virtues and ſufferings of our anceſtors, deſcend to them as a natural inheritance, without toil or pain. But muſt they reſt here as in the utmoſt effort of human genius? Can chance and time, the wiſdom and the experience of publick men, ſuggeſt no new remedy againſt the evils, their vices and ambition are perpetually apt to cauſe? May they not hope without preſumption to preſerve a greater zeal for piety and publick devotion than we have done? For ſure it can hardly happen to them, as it has to us, that when religion is beſt underſtood and rendered moſt pure and reaſonable, that then ſhould be the preciſe time, when many ceaſe to believe and practiſe it, and all in general become moſt indifferent to it. May they not poſſibly be more ſucceſsful than their mother-country has been, in preſerving that reverence and authority, which is due to the laws? to thoſe who make? and to thoſe who execute them? May not a method be invented of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:013009_0009_0F8FB144039CA308"/>
procuring ſome tolerable ſhare of the comforts of life to thoſe inferior uſeful ranks of men, to whoſe induſtry we are indebted for the whole? Time and diſcipline may diſcover ſome means to correct the extreme inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of condition between the rich and the poor, ſo dangerous to the innocence and the happineſs of both. They may fortunately be led by habit and choice to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe that luxury, which is conſidered with us as the true enjoyment of wealth. They may have little reliſh for that ceaſeleſs hurry of amuſements, which is purſued in this country without pleaſure exerciſe, or employment. And perhaps after trying ſome of our follies and caprices, and rejecting the reſt, they may be led by reaſon and experiment to that old ſimplicity, which was firſt pointed out by nature, and has produced thoſe models which we ſtill admire in arts, eloquence and manners. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of new ſcenes and ſituations, which ſo many growing ſtates muſt neceſſarily paſs through, may intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce changes in the fluctuating opinions and manners of men, which we can form no conception of. And not only the gracious diſpoſition of Providence, but the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble preparation of cauſes, ſeems to indicate ſtrong ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies towards a general improvement.</p>
            <p>And I hope that theſe matters, which I have preſumed to dwell upon, perhaps a little too minutely, will not appear totally foreign to the preſent occaſion, if we reflect that to whatever limits the population of our colonies may extend, whatever ſtates and kingdoms they may form; through all the progreſs of their fortunes and proſperity; the labours of this Society will probably continue to operate with an increaſing influence. That ſober and reaſonable ſenſe of duty, which has been taught under our direction to a few ſcattered villages, may give it's character hereafter to the religion and morals of a powerful ſtate. The weak and imperfect fruits we reap at preſent may bear no higher proportion
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013009_0010_0F8FB144C1607290"/>
to the future benefits that may ariſe, than that of a few ſcattered ſeeds to the fulneſs of the harveſt.</p>

               <hi>And perhaps</hi> the diſintereſted zeal of this Society for the inſtruction of our brethren in North America, may tend to REVIVE that union and cordiality between the mother country and it's colonies, which for the common utility ought never to have been interrupted. It is by no means decent from this place to cenſure the conduct of our ſuperiors, or even to ſuppoſe it blameable; but ſurely as goods ſubjects we may wiſh and endeavour to heal the wounds of our country, without enquiring by what hand they were inflicted. We may, and I think we ought to wiſh, that the true intereſt of the whole exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive community may govern our future conteſts, and regulate all our claims. Our mutual relation was formed, and has hitherto ſubſiſted, by a perpetual communication of benefits. We want the produce of ſoils and climates, that differ ſo much from our own; and they will long have occaſion for the fruits of our arts, our induſtry and our experience. And ſhould they ever ceaſe to want our protection, which as long as we render it beneficial to them they never will; yet we may ſtill continue united in intereſt in commerce and the grateful remembrance of old ſervices. May the wiſe and good on both ſides, <hi>without enquiring too curiouſly</hi> into the grounds of paſt animoſities, endeavour by all prudent means to reſtore that old publick friendſhip and confidence, which made us great, happy and victorious. To countries ſo cloſely united it is needleſs, and even dangerous, to have recourſe to the interpretation of charters and written laws. Such diſcuſſions excite jealouſy, and intimate an unfriendly diſpoſition. It is common utility, mutual wants and mutual ſervices, that ſhould point out the true line of ſubmiſſion and authority. Let them reſpect the power that ſaved them; and let us always love the companions of our dangers and our glories. If we conſider their
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:013009_0011_0F8FB1457B323490"/>
proſperity as making part of our own, we ſhall feel no jealouſy at their improvements: and they will always chearfully ſubmit to an authority, which they find is exerciſed invariably to the common advantage. During all our happy days of concord, partly from our national moderation, and partly from the wiſdom and ſometimes perhaps from the careleſsneſs of our miniſters, they have been truſted in a good meaſure with the entire manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their affairs: and the ſucceſs they have met with ought to be to us an ever memorable proof, that the true art of government conſiſts in <hi>not governing too much.</hi> And why ſhould friendſhip and gratitude, and long at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments, which inſpire all the reliſh and ſweetneſs of private life, be ſuppoſed to be of no weight in the intercourſe between great communities? Theſe are principles of human nature, which act with much greater certainty on numbers than on individuals. If properly cultivated they may to us be productive of the nobleſt benefits; and at all events, will neither leſſen the extent of our power, nor ſhorten the duration of it.</p>
            <p>When things are on ſo reaſonable a footing, if there ſhould happen to be any errors in government, they will ſoon be corrected by the friendly diſpoſition of the people; and the endeavours to ſeparate the intereſt of the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies from that of Great Britain will be received with the indignation, that is due to the artifices of <hi>factious men, who wiſh to grow eminent by the misfortunes of their country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Even in that future ſtate of independency, which ſome amongſt them ignorantly wiſh for, but which for their true intereſt can never be too long delayed; the old and prudent will often look back on their preſent happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with regret; and conſider the peace and ſecurity, the ſtate of viſible improvement, and brotherly equality, which they enjoyed under the protection of their mother country, as the true golden age of America.</p>

I need not ſuggeſt how favourable thoſe diſpoſitions muſt prove to the reception of the religious and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent doctrines which it is the buſineſs of this Society to propagate. Under a mutual inclination to peace and good will, the leſſons of piety we teach will be heard with that fair attention which always turns to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of truth; and the claims we will make will be eſtimated (which is all we ought to deſire) by the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of them.</p>
            <p>I own I feel upon my mind a ſtrong impreſſion of the publick advantages that would reſult from this bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent and chriſtian policy; and I could wiſh for the intereſt of mankind, and of our country in particular, that it may not be thought wholly of a viſionary nature. I think I can ſee a ſtrong and immediate demand upon us for ſuch a conduct from the ſituation we are in, and the unuſual occurrences that have paſſed before us within <hi>a few years.</hi> There ſeems at preſent to be a great and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral commotion, and tendency to change in the minds of men. Animated by the gradual improvement of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and the fortunate example of this country, our neighbours have had the courage to think with greater freedom on the moſt important ſubjects, and to look for ſomething better in religion and government, than they find eſtabliſhed among themſelves. And even in this land of liberty, where we have been long in poſſeſſion of the moſt ſolid and valuable truths, the ſpirit of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry is ſtill at work, and urging it's purſuits with a dangerous freedom, that riſks more than it can hope to gain. At the ſame time not only diſcontent and faction, but the real difficulties of things, the extent, the fluctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the intricacies of commerce afford ſufficient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe for political wiſdom. Add to this a vaſt acceſſion of diſtant territory, the art of governing which we are <hi>yet to learn.</hi> Our colonies are riſing into ſtates and nations. The extreme boundaries of the world are
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013009_0013_0F8FB146F0655BC8"/>
opening to our view; and regions, unknown to our fathers, may ſoon become the objects of contention. In this great ſhifting ſcene of human affairs, the concerns of this extenſive empire are growing every year into more importance and dignity. It behoves us to adopt ſome plan of conduct, that ſhall be ſuitable to our ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the high character we ſuſtain. The intereſt of Britain, conſidered ſingly by itſelf, ought not at preſent to be the ſole; and in a few ages may not be the moſt conſiderable object of attention. <hi>We have already tried what advantage is to be found in governing by force, and have no reaſon to be proud of the experiment.</hi> What benefit has accrued to the publick from the plunder and deſolation of an induſtrious helpleſs people? The whole profit, we have reaped from ſo much injuſtice and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, has ended in fraudulent ſchemes, vain and extravagant expectations, ruinous expence and luxury; attended with a general loſs of credit and confidence, a ſudden ſuſpenſion of commerce and induſtry, and an almoſt total ſtoppage of the main ſprings and vital mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſociety. It requires no common degree of wiſdom to deliver our country from ſuch gains and ſuch proſperity as this!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A great liberal commanding ſpirit is wanting;</hi> ſuch as has appeared but rarely in modern times, but was better known to the ancients; which, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting and calculating what is ſtrictly due, can extort affection and gratitude by publick ſervices; which can ſacrifice little and even great intereſts to the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a ſolid permanent authority, founded on juſtice and moderation: which permitting it's ſubjects to enjoy and improve all their natural advantages, can always avail itſelf of their wealth and numbers for the defence or the glory of the empire; <hi>and is ſure to find the moſt powerful reſources of government in their friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and love.</hi>

We preſume not to inſtruct our rulers in the meaſures of government: but it is the proper office of a preacher of the goſpel of peace, to point out the laws of juſtice and equity which muſt ultimately regulate the happineſs of ſtates as well as of individuals: and which are no other in effect than thoſe benevolent chriſtian morals which it is the province of this Society to teach transferred from the duties of private life to the adminiſtration of publick affairs. In fact, by what bond of union ſhall we hold together the members of this great empire, diſperſed and ſcattered as they be over the face of the earth? No <hi>power</hi> can be ſwift or extenſive enough to anſwer the purpoſe. Some art muſt be employed to intereſt all the diſtant parts in the preſervation of the whole; which can only be effected by ſerving<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> obliging and protecting them. It ought not to be the firſt object in contemplation, what we are to get by them; but how we can beſt improve, aſſiſt and reward them; by what benefits we may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their happineſs and win their affection. But is government then intitled to no emoluments in recompence for all its cares? I anſwer, that they who have the heart to do good to thoſe who depend upon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will always meet with an ample return. None are ſo ſure to reap the benefits of the ſoil, as they who have ſpared no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence in the cultivation. And it is univerſally true, that the more we exact from our ſubjects, the leſs we ſhall gain from them. <q>BOUNTIFULNESS IS A PLENTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FUL GARDEN, AND MERCIFULNESS ENDURETH FOR EVER.</q> Let the diſtant nations, that depend upon us, be made to know and feel that they owe their peace and happineſs to our protection. Let them be encouraged to conſider themſelves not as our ſlaves, but as our friends and brethren. And let us endeavour to wipe away the tears from the poor oppreſſed natives of India; and ſuffer them, if poſſible, to enjoy ſome taſte of the legal ſecurity and civil liberty, which renders life dear
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013009_0015_0F8FB14C20727908"/>
to ourſelves; which are bleſſings hitherto unknown to thoſe climates, but more grateful to the heart of man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than all the fruits and odours which nature has laviſhed upon them.</p>
            <p>This righteouſneſs and mercy, which is due to all men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but eſpecially to thoſe who are under our protection, is the law of nature, the command of religion, and it ought to be the firſt and leading maxim of civil policy. But it is amazing how ſlowly in all countries the principles of natural juſtice, which are ſo evidently neceſſary in private life, have been admitted into the adminiſtration of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick affairs. Not many ages ago, it was cuſtomary to engage in war without a reaſonable cauſe or provocation, and to carry it on without humanity or mercy. Since then, it is happily become neceſſary for ſtates to explain their motives, and juſtify their conduct, before they begin to deſtroy their fellow-creatures. And bleſſed be his memory who firſt taught the ſoldier to ſpare the uſeful huſband-man, and to feel a horror at the ſhedding of innocent blood.</p>
            <p>It has been the policy of government, ſuch as it is, from the earlieſt times, to keep diſtant provinces and colonies under the moſt ſevere reſtraints and ſubjection. Yet when thoſe reſtraints have been removed, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-country has always been a great gainer by the advantages ſhe has communicated to her ſubjects. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is a truth, not more important than it is evident and obvious, that the moſt ſure and effectual method of receiving good from men is to do good to them; or, as St. Paul beautifully expreſſes it, <q>TO PROVOKE ONE ANOTHER TO GOOD WORKS.</q> But the minds of men are not ſufficiently prepared and enlightened by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience to adopt it in practice. <hi>A time, I doubt not will come.</hi> in the progreſſive improvement of human affairs, when the checks and reſtraints we lay on the induſtry
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013009_0016_0F8FB14C37C586E0"/>
of our fellow-ſubjects, and the jealouſies we conceive at their proſperity, will be conſidered as the effects of a miſtaken policy, prejudicial to all parties, but chiefly to ourſelves. It would be a noble effort of virtuous am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition to anticipate this diſcovery; to break through the prejudices and ſelfiſh ſpirit of the age; to find a better path to our true intereſt; and to make our country great, and powerful, and rich, not by force or fraud, but by juſtice, friendſhip and humanity.</p>
            <p>I ſhould not have dwelt ſo long on ſo unuſual a ſubject, had it not been for the great and almoſt infinite impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of it. The virtue of a private man aſſiſts and ſupports a few individuals; but this publick virtue does good to thouſands and tens of thouſands. The former relieves the diſtreſs of a friend, or of a family: the latter acts in a higher ſphere; it founds ſtates and kingdoms, or makes them proſperous and happy. Yet all this merit, which a nation can never ſufficiently acknowledge, at leaſt all that we preſume to deſcribe, conſiſts in the right application of the plain good rules, which are ſo often tepeated to us in ſcripture; <q>WHATSOEVER YE WOULD THAT MEN SHOULD DO UNTO YOU, DO YE EVEN SO UNTO THEM. FOLLOW THAT WHICH IS GOOD TO ALL MEN. LOOK NOT EVERY MAN ON HIS OWN THINGS, BUT EVERY MAN ALSO ON THE THINGS OF OTHERS. BEAR YE ONE ANOTHER'S BURTHENS, AND SO FUL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FIL THE LAW OF CHRIST.</q> But theſe truths lie before the eyes of men, like medicinal herbs in the open field; and for want of applying them to their proper objects, they remain ignorant of their virtues. Yet we may ſay, with a pious confidence, that this has not been our own caſe. This Society has thought that we could not obey theſe divine precepts in a manner more agreeable to the true ſpirit of them, than by
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:013009_0017_0F8FB14CF133BBD0"/>
teaching to diſtant nations the truths that are beſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to make them happy. Could we teach them to the great and the wiſe of this world, that would be happineſs indeed; that would be the moſt effectual and the moſt beneficial Propagation of the Goſpel, that the world has yet ſeen. Mankind would then have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental proof of the ſalvation offered to us from above; and would acknowledge with gratitude the propriety of that <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
