            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

As the Government had ſhewn them great Indulgence, in granting them a Council at <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> ſo far from the uſual Place of Buſineſs, and in ſo hot a Seaſon, it was expected they would not detain the Commiſſioners, but deliver what they had to ſay To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow Morning at Ten o'Clock; and further, to deſire they would uſe no Manner of Reſerve, but open their Hearts freely and fully, the Commiſſioners promiſing to treat them with the ſame Freedom and Plainneſs.</p>

                  <q>We, the <hi>Twightwees,</hi> are deſirous to enter into the Chain of Friendſhip with the <hi>Engliſh</hi>; and as you are the next to us of the <hi>Indians</hi> in their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance, we entreat you to ſignify this our Deſire to the other <hi>Indians,</hi> and 
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:006169_0006_1027FEBDF2699FD8"/>
that you and they will open us a Council Road to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Make it ſo open and clear for us, that neither we, nor our Wives or Children, may hurt their Feet againſt any Log or Stump; and when once you have cleared a Road for us, we aſſure you we will keep it ſo, and it ſhall not be in the Power of <hi>Onontio</hi> to block up or obſtruct the Paſſage. We further deſire of you, that when you have cleared a Council Road for us to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> you, and the other <hi>Indians,</hi> will join your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to recommend us in the moſt effectual Manner to them to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into their Chain.</q> Upon receipt of this Meſſage from the <hi>Twightwees,</hi> the following Anſwer was ſent them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren, the</hi> Twightwees,</p>
               <q>We received your String of Wampum expreſſing your Deſire to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Friendſhip with our Brethren the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and praying our Aſſiſtance to obtain this for you. We are glad you are in this Diſpoſition, and wou'd by all Means encourage you in it; but we are afraid leſt you ſhould have taken this Reſolution too haſtily. Are you Proof againſt the Solicitations that the Governor of <hi>Canada</hi> and his People will certainly uſe to engage your Adherence to him? Can you withſtand his Reſentment? Conſider this well, leſt when we ſhall have recommended you to our Brethren the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> you ſhou'd prove unſteady, and ſo we ſhou'd loſe their Eſteem. Take, therefore, we urge you, Time to conſider, and let us know your Mind, and we will give you all the Aſſiſtance in our Power.</q>
               <p>The <hi>Twightwees</hi> having received this Anſwer, ſent in the Spring a ſecond Meſſage, addreſſed to all the <hi>Indians</hi> on <hi>Ohio</hi> in Alliance with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to this purport:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Our Meſſage in the Fall was not ſent raſhly or unadviſedly. We thought many Nights and Days of this Affair. We weighed every Thing well relating thereto before we took the Reſolution of ſeeking the Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and we now repeat to you our Aſſurances, that this Requeſt does not come from the Mouth only; no, it comes from the Heart, and is what we ardently wiſh to accompliſh; and that we may not fail of Succeſs, we deſire your Aſſiſtance, and that of all the <hi>Indians</hi> in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Chain, to help us to obtain this Favour; and particularly we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſome of you will go along with us, and preſent us to <hi>Onas.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have now faithfuly related what paſſed between the <hi>Twightwees</hi> and us. We deliver over to you the Strings of Wampum which we received with their Meſſages. Their Nation has ſent thirty Beaver Skins, which we deſire you would accept; and now be pleaſed to hear what their Deputies have to ſay.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here were laid down two Strings of Wampum, and 30 Beaver Skins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>Andrew Montour</hi> acquainted the Commiſſioners, that he was now going to be the Mouth of the <hi>Twightwee</hi> Deputies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We preſent to you the Calumet Pipe, and pray we may be admitted to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Link in your Chain of Friendſhip, and give you the ſtrongeſt Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, 
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:006169_0007_1027FEBF79D03390"/>
if this Favour be granted to us, that we will keep it bright as long as the Rivers run.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here the Deputies laid down a Calumet Pipe, with a long Stem, curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly wrought, and wrapp'd round with Wampum of ſeveral Colours, and fill'd with Tobacco, which was ſmoked by the Commiſſioners and the</hi> Indians <hi>according to Cuſtom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We the Deputies of the <hi>Twightwees,</hi> have it in Charge further to tell you, that our Nation received a Calumet Pipe from ſome of the Allies, conſiſting of twelve Towns or Nations, with a Meſſage to this Effect: That they had a Report among them that we intended to ſolicit the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to be received into their Friendſhip and Alliance: That if ſuch Report was true, they deſired us to acquaint them with our Succeſs, that they might apply for the ſame Favour, which they earneſtly deſire, and ſaid they would wait a Day and a Night for an Anſwer.
<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>N. B.</hi> A day and a Night in the <hi>Indian</hi> Language ſignifics a whole Year.</note> Then the Deputies offered another Pipe to the Commiſſioners, not to keep, but that they might ſpeak to it, and return it, with their Anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Andrew Montour</hi> ſaid he was now going to reſume the Speech of the <hi>Six Nation Indians</hi> at <hi>Ohio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You have now heard the <hi>Twightwees</hi> ſpeak for themſelves. We heartily join with them in their Petition. They are numerous, and, tho' poor, yet they are worthy of your Friendſhip, and, as ſuch we moſt heartily recommend them to you by this Bundle of Skins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here they laid down a Bundle of Deer Skins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We beg Leave before we conclude to become Interceſſors for the <hi>Shaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe,</hi> who have given you juſt Cauſe of Complaint. They have told us, that the Governor of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> ſent them a Letter ſome Years ago, requiring them to come down; but being conſcious they had acted wrong, they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay'd hitherto to do it; and have taken this Opportunity of our coming, to make uſe of us; deſiring us to aſk that for them which they dare not aſk for themſelves; that is, That they may be receiv'd again into Favour, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving owned their Fault, and given us the ſtrongeſt Aſſurances of their better Behaviour for the future. Forgive us, therefore, if we entreat you would be pleas'd to drop your Reſentment; and however they have behav'd hitherto, we hope a Senſe of your Goodneſs will prevail with them to become good and faithful Allies for the future.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Brethren of the</hi> Six Nations, <hi>And others, living at</hi> Ohio,</p>
               <p>It gives us no ſmall Satisfaction to obſerve the Regard you have ſhewn to the Meſſages ſent you by the Governors of his Majeſty's Provinces, in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to gain over to His Majeſty's Intereſt as many of your Allies as you cou'd influence: This is agreable to your Duty, and was recommended to you in a particular Manner by the Governor of this Province at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of the <hi>French</hi> War. As the <hi>Twightwees</hi> ſhew'd ſo great an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to enter into our Friendſhip, and deſir'd you to conduct them hither, the Part you have acted on this Occaſion was kind and prudent, and we think ourſelves oblig'd to you for encouraging them, and ſhewing them the Way.</p>
               <p>Our Approbation of your Conduct is teſtified by this String of Wampum.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As there is Reaſon to think from the Manner in which the <hi>Twightwees</hi> have made their Application for a Council Road to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Provinces, that it is not a ſudden, or a haſty Step, but well conſider'd by them, and may take its Riſe from the different Treatment which <hi>Indians</hi> of all Nations meet with at the Hands of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> from what they experience while in the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt, we are inclinable to think them ſincere, and that when admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Chain, they will not lightly break it.</p>
               <p>A Council Road to this Province is a Meaſure which nearly concerns you, as it is to be laid out thro' your Towns, and no doubt you have thought well of this, and conceive you may depend on the Sincerity of their Profeſſions, and that it may be for our mutual Benefit, or you wou'd not join with them in making this Requeſt. At your Inſtance therefore, and from the Opinion we have of your Prudence and Integrity, we conſent that ſuch Road may be opened; and it may be depended on, that on our Parts it will always be kept clean; not the leaſt Obſtruction ſhall be ſuffer'd to remain in it. In Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation whereof</p>
               <p>We give this String of Wampum.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren of the</hi> Twightwee <hi>Nation,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the Interceſſion of our good Friends and Allies the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> we have granted you a Council Road, whereby you have free Acceſs to any of His Majeſty's Provinces; we admit you into our Friendſhip and Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and therefore now call you BRETHREN, an Appellation which we hold ſacred, and in which is included every Thing that is dear. It obliges us to give you Aſſiſtance on all Occaſions, to exerciſe unfeign'd Affection towards you, to take you into our Boſoms, to uſe our Eyes, and Ears, and Hands, as well for you, as for ourſelves. Nothing is put in Competition by an <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> with the Faith and Honour due to thoſe whom our gracious King pleaſes to take into his Protection, admit into his Chain of Friendſhip, and make them our Fellow Subjects: From that Moment they become our own Fleſh and Blood, and what hurts them will equally hurt us. Do you, on your Parts, look upon this important Name of Brethren in the ſame Light; You muſt no more think of <hi>Onontio,</hi> and his <hi>Children</hi>; all that ſort of Relation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip now ceaſes; His Majeſty's Friends are your Friends, and His Majeſty's

The <hi>Engliſh</hi> when they conſent to take any Nation into their Alliance, draw up a Compact in Writing, which is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully intepreted to the contracting Parties, and when maturely conſider'd, and clearly and fully underſtood by each Side, their Aſſent is declar'd in the moſt publick Manner, and the Stipulation render'd authentick by ſealing the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument with Seals, whereon are engraven their Families Arms, writing their Names, and publiſhing it as their Act and Deed, done without Force or Conſtraint, freely and voluntarily. This is the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Method of rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Treaties; this is the grand Security each gives of his Faith; and our Brethren of the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> the <hi>Delawares, Shawoneſe,</hi> and all other <hi>Indian</hi> Nations, when they firſt enter'd into the Chain of Friendſhip with us, execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Inſtruments of this Nature; and as you are now one People with us, in the ſame Manner with all other of our <hi>Indian</hi> Allies, it will be expected by this, and His Majeſty's other Governments, that you will do the ſame. For your Satisfaction we now ſhew you ſome of the Deeds that the <hi>Indians</hi> exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted when they firſt enter'd into our Alliance.</p>

                  <hi>Brethern, Deputies of the</hi> Twigtwees,</p>
               <p>You ſay ſome of your Allies having heard of your Intentions to apply for Admittance into the Friendſhip and Alliance with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> deſired you to acquaint them with the Succeſs of ſuch Application, to the End that they might have an Opportunity of aſking the ſame Favour. As we don't know the Names of thoſe of your Allies, their Number or Situation, we cannot be more particular at preſent on this Head, than to tell you, that we are always ready to receive favourably the Applications of all thoſe whom our Brethren of the <hi>Six Nations</hi> ſhall recommend as worthy of our Friendſhip and Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <hi>Brethren of the</hi> Six Nations, &amp;c. at Ohio,</p>
               <p>You perceive that at your Requeſt we have received the <hi>Twightwees</hi> into our Friendſhip: We take kindly your conducting them to us for that End; and as a Proof of our being well pleaſed with your Cond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>t on this Occaſion, we have ordered our Interpreter to deliver to you at Mr. <hi>Croghan</hi>'s ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Goods, that are lodged there for the uſe of the <hi>Indians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Brethren,</p>
               <p>Your Interceſſion for the <hi>Shawoneſe</hi> puts us under Difficulties. It is at leaſt two Years ſince the Governor of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> wrote to <hi>Cackewatcheka</hi> a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wherein he condeſcended, out of regard to him, and a few other <hi>Shawo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe,</hi> who preſerved their Fidelity, to offer thoſe who broke the Chain a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don on their Submiſſion, on their Return to the Towns they had deſerted, 
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:006169_0011_1027DB0783B52C48"/>
and on their coming down to <hi>Philadelphia</hi> to evidence in Perſon the Sincerity of their Repentance. This they ſhould have immediately complied with, and they would have readily been admitted into Favour; but as they did not do it, what can be ſaid for them? You who live amongſt them beſt know their Diſpoſitions, and wou'd not, it may be hoped, become Mediators for them, were you not perſuaded they wou'd return to their Duty. Some of them, it may be allowed, are weak People, and were preverted from their Duty by the Perſwaſions of others; but this cannot be thought to be the Caſe of <hi>Neucheconno,</hi> and a few more. As therefore you have taken upon you the Office of Interceſſors, take this String of Wampum, and therewith chaſtiſe <hi>Neucheconno</hi> and his Party in ſuch Terms as ſhall carry a proper Severity with them, tho' the Expreſſions are left to your Diſcretion; and then tell the delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent <hi>Shawoneſe,</hi> that we will forget what is paſs'd, and expect a more punctual Regard to their Engagements hereafter.</p>
               <p>Here was deliver'd a String of Wampum.</p>
               <p>'Tis but Juſtice to diſtinguiſh the Good from the Bad; <hi>Cackewatcheky</hi> and his Friends, who had Virtue enough to reſiſt the many fine Promiſes made by the Emiſſaries of the <hi>French,</hi> will ever be remember'd with Gratitude, and challenge our beſt Services. To teſtify our Regard for theſe, we preſent them with this</p>
               <p>Belt of Wampum.</p>
               <p>And have order'd our Interpreter, who is going to <hi>Ohio,</hi> to give them a Preſent of Goods.</p>
               <p>The Commiſſioners gave a handſome Entertainment to the Deputies of the <hi>Twightwees,</hi> and the <hi>Indians</hi> who conducted them from <hi>Ohio,</hi> and after Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner enter'd into a free Converſation with them about the Numbers and Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Towns, and thoſe of their Allies; and by their Informations it appears that the River <hi>Ouabache</hi> takes its Riſe from a Lake at a ſmall Diſtance from the Weſt-End of Lake <hi>Eric,</hi> from which it runs South Weſterly four or 500 Miles, and falls into the <hi>Ohio,</hi> about three hundred Miles from the <hi>Miſſiſſippi</hi>; that on this River, and another River call'd the <hi>Hatchet,</hi> the <hi>Twightwees</hi> and their Allies have twenty Towns, and that they count One Thouſand ſighting Men; that it is a plain Country, and of a rich Soil, aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with Game. The principal Deputy of the <hi>Twightwees</hi> laid down with Chalk the Courſes of the <hi>Miſſiſſippi,</hi> of <hi>Ouabache</hi> and of <hi>Ohio,</hi> marking the Situation of their own Towns, of Lake <hi>Erie,</hi> and of two Forts that the <hi>French</hi> have on the <hi>Miſſiſſippi</hi>; whereby it is manifeſt, that if theſe <hi>Indians</hi> and their Allies prove faithful to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> will be depriv'd of the moſt convenient and neareſt Communication with their Forts on the <hi>Miſſiſſippi,</hi> the ready Road lying thro' their Nations, and that there will be nothing to interrupt an Intercourſe between this Province and that great River.</p>

               <p>Taminy Buck, <hi>one of the Chiefs of the</hi> Shawoneſe, <hi>ſtood up, and ſpoke as follows</hi>:</p>
               <p>Brethren,</p>
               <p>WE, the <hi>Shawoneſe,</hi> ſenſible of our ungrateful Returns for the many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours we have been all along receiving from our Brethren the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,</hi> ever ſince we firſt made the Chain of Friendſhip, came along the Road with our Eyes looking down to the Earth, and have not taken them from thence till this Morning, when you were pleaſed to chaſtiſe us, and then pardon us. We have been a fooliſh People, and acted wrong, tho' the Sun ſhone bright, and ſhew'd us very clearly what was our Duty. We are ſorry for what we have done, and promiſe better Behaviour for the future. We produce to you a Certificate of the Renewal of our Friendſhip in the Year 1739 by the Proprietor and Governor. Be pleaſed to ſign it afreſh, that it may appear to the World we are now admitted into your Friendſhip, and all former Crimes are buried, and intirely forgot.</p>
               <p>The Commiſſioners receiv'd the Deed, but reſuſed to ſign it, letting them know they were forgiven on Condition of better Behaviour for the future; and when they ſhall have performed that Condition, it will be time enough to apply for ſuch Teſtimonials. Orders were given for mending their Guns and Hatchets, and then the <hi>Twightwees</hi> were told that the Secretary was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring an Inſtrument for rendering authentick our Treaty of Friendſhip with them, which wou'd be ready at Nine o' Clock in the Morning, to which Time the Commiſſioners adjourn'd.</p>
