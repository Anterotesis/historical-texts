            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>WILLIAM FLEMING, (who was taken about the firſt of November laſt) after giving a ſmall Account of the Eſcape of one BURNS, who was taken by the Indians, goes on:</head>
               <p>I Was in the Neighbourhood where<note n="*" place="bottom">Burns <hi>had been taken Priſoner by the</hi> Delaware <hi>Indians ſome Time before</hi> Fleming, <hi>and was carried to their Wigwams, but being one Day ſent to a Spring for Water, with an Indian Guard, in returning, he ſtopped under Pretence of tying his Mockaſheens which were looſe. All the</hi> Indians <hi>who was his Guard, got out of Sight; when he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately mounted a horſe nigh at Hand, and rode full Speed to the inhabited Parts of the</hi> Province.</note> 
                  <hi>Burns</hi> gave the above Relation, 7 Miles from my own Home, and though many who heard him, treated it as only the groundleſs Surmiſes of the Timorous, having too favourable an Opinion of the friendly Attachment of theſe Indians to this Province; yet I was determined however not to be too Fool-hardy, but haſten home, and remove my Wife and Effects to a neighbouring Fort. But, alas! by the Time I had got within two Miles of my Houſe, two <hi>Indians</hi> ſtarted from behind the Root of a Tree, cloſe by the Way Side, and had hold of my Horſe's Bridle by the Time I well ſaw them. They commanded me to alight, very complaiſantly ſhook Hands, and told me (for they could ſpeak good Engliſh) I muſt go with them: But oh! what Tongue can utter the Horror and Confuſion which in an Inſtant overwhelmed me, on find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing myſelf in the very Hands of thoſe I was flying to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void: I ſtood trembling and Speechleſs for ſome Time,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:007662_0003_102DB9E66F6CC328"/>
which my Enemies, ſavage as they were, took Notice of, and endeavoured to encourage me, by clapping me ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Times on the Shoulder, and bidding me not be afraid, for as I looked young and luſty, they would not hurt me, provided I was willing to go with them, and promiſe to ſtand by them, in Caſe they ſhould be attack'd by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in our future Proceedings: One of them who was pretty well dreſſed, told me his Name was Captain JACOB, and that he was Captain over the <hi>Indians</hi> in that Expedition, being 50 in all: He ſaid he knew I could be of Service in leading him to thoſe Houſes that were moſt defenceleſs; and added, that if I proved faithful, he would uſe me well, and ſaid, that tho' he was Captain over the aforeſaid <hi>Indians,</hi> yet he had only one with him, and they were afraid to venture on Houſes that had many Inhabitants, and that he would ſpare my Life on Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I would help.</p>
               <p>Upon theſe fair Promiſes I began to recover my Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and finding I muſt either act the Part he had aſſign'd me, or ſubmit to the moſt cruel Torture, I concluded it moſt expedient to do the Former, remembring the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Job, All that a Man hath will he give for his Life:</hi> But when I reflected on the Part I had undertaken to act, when I conſidered the dreadful Conſequences of my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations, I was grieved beyond Meaſure, and led the Way more like a condemn'd Criminal to meet his Fate, than one that had a Promiſe of Life and Happineſs: Beſides the Thoughts of leaving my poor dear Wife for ever, without being able to inform her of my Fate, or her own Danger, almoſt diſtracted me. My Maſter per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving me dejected, and ſomewhat backward in my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, concluded I ſhould be more Trouble than Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to him, and began not only to alter his Conduct, but gave me to underſtand that I was no longer at my own Diſpoſal: This obliged me, though with Reluctance, to confeſs, I had a Wife not many Miles off, and that all my Concern was for her; upon which he told me he was glad to hear that, for they wanted a Woman to make Bread for them, and therefore inſiſted on my leading them
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007662_0004_102DB9E8088EC3F0"/>
to my Houſe: Though indeed from ſome Part of their former Treatment, I had no Reaſon to expect any Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to induce me to a Compliance, in whatever they thought proper to demand, yet whatever might be the real Motive, they uſed ſeveral on this Occaſion; one of which was, that it would be better to have her along with myſelf, than ſuffer her to ſtay where ſhe was, as there was great Danger of ſome other <hi>Indians</hi> coming that Way, which if they did, ſhe need expect no Mercy at their Hands; for he, Captain <hi>Jacob,</hi> had ordered his <hi>Indians</hi> to ſpare none but young Men and young Women. This Information quite revived me, and I was even glad of the Privilege of leading them that Way: I knew we had to paſs by one <hi>Hicks'</hi>s, who had a numerous Family of able young Men, and was in great Hopes of being reſcued by them: But when we came within Sight of the Houſe, they did not advance towards it as I expected, but paſſed by at a Diſtance, and then ſtopped to conſider what was moſt proper to be done. Whilſt we tarried here, it unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately happened that two of <hi>Hicks'</hi>s Sons came out from Dinner, in order to work at an adjacent new Settlement: The <hi>Indians</hi> on ſeeing them ran behind Trees, and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to do the ſame between them: I complied, but was in hopes theſe <hi>Two</hi> would be followed out by ſome more of the Family, which might afford me an Opportunity of Eſcape; but my Hopes were ſoon fruſtrated, for they having no Suſpicion of Danger, advanced careleſly on till the foremoſt came oppoſite to the <hi>Indian</hi> that ſtood neareſt to me, who immediately ſprung out and ſeiz'd and pinion'd the unhappy Victim. He ſcreamed in a moſt piteous Manner for Help, but alas! there was none to be found. His Brother fled back to the Houſe with the utmoſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation, whence not one would venture out. For my Part I was not in a Condition to afford the leaſt Relief, not being allowed to carry even a Stick about me. They then hurried us away towards my Houſe with the utmoſt Speed, fearing their new Captive might be releaſed by his Relations.</p>
               <p>The unhappy Youth not being accuſtomed to ſuch
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007662_0005_102DB9E9B66E76A8"/>
Treatment as he now met with; and not being appriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the bad Conſequences that might attend the leaſt Reſiſtance, diſcovered great uneaſineſs, and could not be prevailed upon to keep ſilent: Had not the <hi>Indians</hi> been acquainted with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue, I ſhould have thought it my Duty to admoniſh him to a Compliance with their capricious Humours, till Providence might favour us with an Opportunity of Eſcape: But as I could advance no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to mitigate his Grief but what might tend to betray my Intentions, and convince my Enemies that I was not ſo taken with my preſent way of Life, nor ſo much at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to their Intereſt as they imagined, I was obliged to be entirely ſilent, and leave him to their Management.</p>
               <p>Though they ſpoke all their Secrets in their own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, I could plainly perceive Reſentment kindle in their very Looks, which made me ſhudder and tremble for his Fate: But why do I ſay his, ſeeing my Life was as much at the Diſpoſal of theſe mercileſs Wretches as his, and I had no Reaſon to expect but that when they began, we ſhould equally fall a Sacrifice to their cruel Reſentment: All the Advantages I had to boaſt of ſuperior to him were, that I had been longer in their Service, and had the Policy to counterfeit a chearful Behaviour, whilſt he continued obſtinate to the laſt Degree; but whether they would condeſcend to take theſe Things into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, I was at a Loſs to determine.</p>
               <p>We had now got within a Mile of my Houſe, when my poor Wife ſhould have employed all my Thoughts, had they not been diverted by my own melancholy Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation: For being now in the midſt of a conſiderable Thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, our Maſters came to another conſultation concerning their future Proceedings. Which being done, one of them being placed near a Tree, ordered me to advance towards him, which I did, with my uſual Submiſſion, not in the leaſt ſuſpecting his Deſign: But if I had, the leaſt ſeeming Reluctance might have proved my Ruin. He then placed himſelf on the oppoſite Side of the Tree, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered me to ſit down with my Back to the Tree, and after pulling my Arms backwards round it, tied them
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007662_0006_102DB9ECC0F51248"/>
with a Deer's Sinew, then put on Leather Muffs on my Hands, to keep me from uſing my Fingers, and then tied them likewiſe together. I had the Mortification to find my Timerity only excited Ridicule and Laughter in my <hi>cruel Perſecutors,</hi> who made Sport of my Miſeries and mock'd at my Fears.</p>
               <p>Being ſo intent upon my own Preſervation, it may eaſily be imagined I could not be very attentive to the Fate of my unhappy Companion: I ſaw him however ſeized by the Indian who was with Capt. <hi>Jacob,</hi> whoſe Name was <hi>Jim,</hi> who with remorſeleſs Cruelty gave him a Blow with the Back of his Tomahawk which ſtunn'd him; but before he fell, another was repeated in the ſame Manner, which brought him to the Ground, where he lay ſome Minutes motionleſs: The inhuman Wretch ſtood over him, in order to diſcover if any Signs of Life remain'd, and upon finding him ſtir, and put up his Hand to his Face to wipe off the Blood which quite blinded him, took up the ſame Tomahawk that had brought him thus near his End, and with one fatal Blow ſunk it in his Skull. This tragical Scene renewed their Sport, they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting to imitate his expiring Agonies: There remained nothing now to compleat their inhuman Barbarity but to ſcalp him which was done almoſt in an Inſtant. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to deſcribe my Horror on ſeeing this: Death at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with its moſt frightful Terrors ſtared me in the Face, and I even wiſhed I had been ſo happy as to have been firſt out of Pain, and not lived to ſee what I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly thought next Moment would be my own Fate thus barbarouſly acted in that of my Companion. The cruel Monſters all over beſmared with his Blood advanced towards me, and told me with an Air of Inſult, nothing out my good Behaviour for the future, ſhould ſave me from the ſame Treatment; and ſo untied my Hands, which were ſo benum'd that I hardly ever expected to be able to uſe them.</p>
               <p>We now advanced again towards my Houſe, and in a little Time came within Sight of it! But alas! with what Regret did I introduce my Gueſts to my poor Wife:
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007662_0007_102DB9EEEAC8CDF8"/>
She, poor Thing, upon ſeeing them, had like to have fallen into Fits. I gave her all the Conſolation I was able, tho' Horror and Deſpair was viſible in my very Looks: I told her, Cries and Tears would now avail nothing, and ſhe could not better recommend herſelf to our Maſter's Favour, than by being chearful, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to obey. Whilſt I was thus employed the <hi>Indians</hi> were buſied in ranſacking the Houſe from Top to Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, of every Thing they thought worth taking, and after they had made up a Sack of Meal for me, and a Bundle of Clothes for my Wife to carry, commanded us to depart. Here our Grief was again renewed on leaving our Houſe, Stock, Grain, and in ſhort our All, behind us, without being able to depute any one to take Care of them in our Abſence, or the moſt diſtant Proſpect of ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to them. Theſe Reflections however juſt, availed us Nothing, for before we left Sight of the Houſe, the Captain ordered <hi>Jim,</hi> to return and ſet Fire to it, which he did ſo effectually, that in a few Minutes the whole was in a Blaze. As complaining of this Hardſhip to our cruel Perſecutors would have no more effect than ſpeaking to the Wind, we addreſſed ourſelves to the ALMIGHTY for his Protection, with a becoming Refignation to whatever might be our Fate; when we ſet off from my Houſe it was about 3 o'Clock in the Afternoon, we directed our Courſe right back in the Woods about Half a Mile, they bid us put down our Luggage, and the Captain ordered <hi>Jim</hi> and me to go and hunt Horſes to carry my Wife and the Luggage, which we accordingly did, but not getting any, we went to the aforeſaid <hi>Hicks</hi>s, and in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the Lane towards the Houſe <hi>Jim</hi> took hold of me by the Shoulder, and in approaching the Houſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways kept me between him and it, thinking they would not ſhoot at me, and if they did, I ſhould ſcrene him from the Shot; when we came up to the Door of the Houſe, which was open, he quitted me, and jump'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Houſe, with his Tomahawk in one Hand and Gun in the other, but found the People all gone, for on the Alarm aforeſaid, the whole of the Family, ſeven in

Number, had deſerted the Houſe, and were making to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Fort, but, unhappily for them, fell in with another Party of ſaid <hi>Indians,</hi> who murdered two of them, and took the reſt Priſoners [as I afterwards was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Inhabitants of <hi>Conecochieg.</hi>] When he found that the Houſe was deſerted, he rumaged up ſuch Things as pleaſed him beſt, and carried 'em to ſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance where he laid them down, then he ſet Fire to the Houſe, and ordered me to gather up all things that were of Uſe to the Owners and put them therein, and at the ſame Time bid me ſet Fire to the Barn, in which was a large Quantity of Grain, and likewiſe to ſeveral Barracks of Grain and Fodder, that ſtood by it, which I ſeem'd heartily to comply with, but purpoſely avoided firing the Barn and Grain by employing myſelf in gathering up the firſt-mentioned, and burning them. When all Things were thrown in the Fire that was near the Houſe, we went to make up our Bundles in order to make off, but <hi>Jim</hi> by looking about him, diſcovered that the Barn, &amp;c. were not fired according to his Orders; he aſk'd me what was the Reaſon I had not done it? I excus'd myſelf by telling him I was fully employ'd in burning the other Things: he then haſtily ran and took a Brand of Fire, and quickly ſet them all in Flames. We then made the beſt of our Way with the Plunder to the Place where we had left Capt. <hi>Jacob</hi> and my Wife, found their Bundles, but they gone; while I was conjecturing the Reaſon, <hi>Jim</hi> gave a Whiſtle, and the Capt. anſwer'd (who had mov'd himſelf to ſome Diſtance, for Security, leſt I ſhould by ſome Means or other kill <hi>Jim,</hi> and bring the white People upon him.) When we diſcovered where they were, we ran to him, and <hi>Jim</hi> related our Succeſs, and told how well (as he ſaid) I had behaved. Upon which the Capt. gave me his Hand, and ſaid, <hi>Well done Brother, you ſhall go to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               <p>My Wife's Relation of what paſſed betwixt her and Capt. <hi>Jacob,</hi> after I and <hi>Jim</hi> went to catch Horſes, is as follows: <hi>She was very uneaſy to be left alone with Capt.</hi> Jacob, <hi>and wanted to go after us to help catch the Horſes;

but he would not ſuffer it, ſaying, She was not able, and ſhe muſt ſtay with him till we returned, further adding, that ſhe need not be afraid of him for he would not hurt her; he then threw a Shirt of mine to her, and an old Petticoat, ordered her to ſtrip and put on the Shirt and Petticoat, which ſhe complied with, and while ſhe was do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, he turn'd his Back on her, and went to ſome diſtance with the other Indian's Bundle, and plunder'd it of ſuch Things as he liked. When he return'd he took the Cloths ſhe pull'd off and put them in his Bundle, and bid her not to tell</hi> Jim <hi>what he had done; then they mov'd off to ſome Diſtance, where we found them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About Sun-down we pitched on a Place for our Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and our next Buſineſs was to get Wood and make a Fire, round which we ſat without Diſtinction; which to Perſons in our Circumſtances, may be eſteemed a Mark of no ſmall Condeſcention.</p>
               <p>My Wife being embold'ned by the Familiarity of our Maſters aſk'd them ſeveral Queſtions touching their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for uſing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> as they did, ſeeing they had always treated the <hi>Indians</hi> (particularly the <hi>Delawares</hi> and <hi>Shawaneſe</hi>) with the greateſt Friendſhip: To this they anſwered, <hi>That when a Number of</hi> Indians <hi>offered to join G—l</hi> B—k <hi>againſt the</hi> French, <hi>he did not uſe them well, and had threatned to deſtroy all the</hi> Indians <hi>on the Continent, after they had conquered the</hi> French, <hi>and they were informed by the</hi> French, <hi>the</hi> Pennſylvanians, Marylanders <hi>and</hi> Virginians <hi>had laid the ſame Plot.</hi> She then aſked, what they intended to do with thoſe they took Priſoners: To which the Captain anſwered, <hi>That they had been order'd by the</hi> French <hi>to bring them all to the</hi> Ohio, <hi>when you get there, you ſhall live well, and be given as Kindred to our Friends.</hi> (Which I did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, as they told my Wife one Story, and me another; but expected every Moment to be ſacriſic'd by them; yet ſo far as I could learn, the <hi>French</hi> were to allow them a certain Sum per Scalp and for Priſoners, if they were young, and fit for Buſineſs; but the old People and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren they kill'd and ſcalped, as well as ſuch as were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory

and not willing to go with them.) She then aſked them if they did not think it a Sin to ſhed ſo much innocent Blood? They anſwered, <hi>That the</hi> French <hi>were better off than the</hi> Engliſh, <hi>for they had a great many old Men among them that could forgive all their Sins, and theſe Men had often aſſured the</hi> Indians <hi>it was no Sin to deſtroy Hereticks, and all the</hi> Engliſh <hi>were ſuch. They then told me not to be afraid that they ſhould abuſe my Wife, for they would not do it for Fear of affronting their God,</hi> (and pointed their Hands towards Heaven) <hi>for the Man that affronts his God, will ſurely be kill'd when he goes out to War; this,</hi> (continued they,) <hi>is what makes the</hi> Engliſh <hi>have ſuch bad Luck.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They ſat up eating Bread and Cheeſe, and dry'd Peaches, and ſmoking Tobacco, (which they got at <hi>Hicks'</hi>s,) hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had no Tobacco, as they told us, for four or five Days, and were in great Want of it. While they were thus em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd, I heard a Noiſe, which I could not tell the Reaſon of. The <hi>Indians</hi> obſerving my liſtening, ſaid, <hi>It is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Spirit of that Son of a Whore whom we kill'd.</hi> My Wife then aſk'd them if they were not afraid of his Spirit?

               </p>
               <p>About Two Hours before Day our Maſters being tired with Acts of Cruelty, began to think of compoſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Reſt. They firſt ſhewed us where and how to lie, then lay down themſelves with their Guns under them, leſt we might uſe them to their Prejudice: Being thus diſpoſed, it was not long before they fell into a deep Sleep, which my Wife being watchful to obſerve, began to think on making uſe of the Opportunity put into our Hands of making an Eſcape: She communicated her Sentiments in Whiſpers to me, and it is reaſonable to think, I ſhould readily concur in whatever might have a Proſpect of accompliſhing what I ſo ardently deſired: But as a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage in an Attempt of this Nature would infallibly have proved our Ruin, common Prudence required we
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007662_0011_102DB9F77653DE10"/>
ſhould act cautiouſly, and be ſure they were in reality in as deep a Slumber as they pretended to be: To this end, we got up, and went to the Fire, under Pretence of mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and warming ourſelves, (and indeed we ſtood in need of it having nothing to defend us from the Incle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of the Weather, but a ſingle Blanket.) In all which we made ſo much Buſtle and Noiſe, as we judged might awake Perſons in an ordinary Sleep: But finding they ſtill ſnoared on, I took up a Tankard, and told my Wife I would go towards a Spring, at which I had been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently before, and if after I had got there they ſtill ſlept on, deſired ſhe might follow: And added, that if they ſhould awake e're we got off, our having the Tankard might convince them we really wanted to quench our Thirſt.</p>
               <p>When we took leave of our cold Lodging, we had no Intention of ſeparating: For tho' we left the Fire at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Times we intended to meet at the Spring: But after I had got there, and waited ſome Time, I at laſt ſaw her a coming, I threw down my Tankard intending to hide myſelf on the other Side the Run in a Thicket, till ſhe came up; but in my Hurry, I ran againſt a Sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling which ſtunn'd me, and I lay in this Condition ſome Time (during which I ſuppose my Wife came to the Run and not finding me made the beſt of her Way off.) When I recovered, I went on in the beſt Manner I could till Day began to dawn, when I found myſelf within Sight of a Houſe to my unſpeakable Joy: When I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced near it I knew the Place, which however was quite abandoned by the Dwellers.</p>
               <p>Having now a tolerable good Knowledge of my Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I made directly to the next inhabited Part of <hi>Coneco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieg,</hi> when I got there, I was informed that a Company of Three Hundred Men from Marſh-Creek were out in queſt of the Enemy under Colonel <hi>Hamilton,</hi> I joined myſelf as ſoon as I could with theſe, intending to return with them and try to find out my Wife, with whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition I was now more affected, being out of Danger my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:007662_0012_102DB9F99CDE1748"/>
We went on viewing the Devaſtation, till we came to <hi>Adam McConnel'</hi>s Plantation, where we met with a Party of Ten Men, who had ſeparated from this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſome Time before: Theſe brought in a Woman who they ſaid was found by them at an Oven in great Diſtreſs; and whom, upon my nearer Approach, to my unſpeakable Surprize and Joy, I found to be my Wife.</p>
               <p>After greeting each other in the moſt affectionate Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, with Tears of Joy, we returned Thanks to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent Being who led us ſafe through the Wilderneſs, and preſerved us from the Jaws of Death. When ſhe recovered her Tranſports, we deſired a Relation of her Adventures from the unhappy Moment ſhe and I parted; which ſhe gave in Subſtance as follows:</p>

               <p>A Few Minutes after my Huſband was gone from the Fire, finding the <hi>Indians</hi> took no Notice of it, I concluded they were ſtill aſleep, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my Promiſe followed him, but not finding him at the Spring, knew not which Courſe to ſteer, which threw me into the utmoſt Confuſion; yet I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to make my Eſcape, and endeavoured for that Purpoſe; but really I ſeem'd in as bad a Situation as ever. <q>How dreadful was this Night to me, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Wanderer!

               </p>
               <p>However after I had wandered ſome Time, I came to a little Hill, which when I had aſcended, found myſelf ſtill nearer my Enemies than I deſired, for I could plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive the Fire blaze, by the Light of which I ſaw them lie in the ſame Poſture I left them. I made off with as much Precipitation as I could, and continued wandering till Day, during which Time I fell over a dead Man, which I concluded to be <hi>Hicks,</hi> and therefore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected my Courſe accordingly for our own Corn-field, near the Remains of our Houſe. The Joy however I conceived at this was ſoon allayed by hearing two <hi>Indian</hi> Holo's, and the Report of five Guns. Fancying myſelf now in the Jaws of Death, I made directly to ſome Heaps of Fodder, and hid myſelf, and lay there ſome Time; when I left this I directed my Courſe along a Path nine Miles to a Fort, but found it deſerted, and every Thing about it in the greateſt Diſorder; concluding there was little Shelter to be had here, I aſcended a Hill hard by, from the Top of which I imagined I ſhould be able to diſcover ſome Settlements, or at leaſt ſome Road that might lead that Way; but when I began to look about, I ſaw ſo many Houſes in a Blaze that I almoſt concluded the whole Province was in Flames. The Smoke flew ſo thick that it darkened the very Air about me to that Degree, as to prevent me from diſtinguiſhing any Thing at a Diſtance from the Fires. <q>Let any one figure to themſelves the Melancholly of my Condition; no Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to relieve me, or eleviate my Grief!

               </p>
               <p>I ſoon after left the Hill, and was going I knew not where, when I came up to a Houſe almoſt conſumed to

Aſhes, and ſaw near it ſeveral Cows newly killed, by which I concluded the Enemy could not be far off; I ran to look for ſome Place in which to ſecure myſelf from their Fury, but could find none: I perceived one of the Cows theſe inhuman Butchers had ſhot was not quite dead, and as ſhe lay almoſt cloſe to a Fence, ſtrctched myſelf down behind her; but had not been long in that Poſture before I heard two Guns go off, by which I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the Enemy were advancing towards me, and conſequently the Place in which I had now taken Refuge, could not be very ſafe: So I crept to a Thicket, where I lay till Half an Hour paſt Sun-down, when hearing all quiet round me, removed to an Oven, belonging to <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert McConnel,</hi> and after ſome Difficulty got into it, and reſted about an Hour; but being terrified with frightful Thoughts, and not being able to reconcile myſelf to it longer, left it, with an Intention to go to the Top of another Hill. Before I got quite up, I happened una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares almoſt on a Fire, by the Side of which lay two <hi>Indians,</hi> with white Match-coats: The Sight almoſt frighted me to Death, but I had no other Shift than to run behind a Tree, where I ſtood trembling for near Half an Hour. As I had no Notion of being ſo near Ruin, I advanced careleſly on, and made ſo much Noiſe among the Leaves and Shrubs as I then apprehended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked theſe Blood-hounds, who immediately ſtarted up, took up their Guns, then liſtened: I now reſigned my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Will of Providence, thinking my Miſeries near at an End, but all on a ſudden they returned to their Fire making a loud Laugh; by this I found my Glaſs was not yet run. This Conduct at firſt appeared truly ſurprizing, for though indeed I now ſtood behind a Tree, I was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt fure they had ſeen me. Whilſt I was thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecturing the Reaſon of the miraculous Preſervation, I heard two or three Hogs grunt and ſtir among the Leaves (which my Fright had not ſuffered me before to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve) between whom and the Enemy I was behind a Tree, I concluded that it had been the Noiſe made by them they had been awaked. <q>How wonderful, how myſterious,

are the Ways of Heaven? By what unſeen, ungueſſed at Means are frequently the greateſt Deliverances bro't about.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Being thus ſurprizingly ſaved, I tarried behind the Tree till I judged the Enemy had got to ſleep, and then made the beſt of my Way, bleſſing God for his remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Deliverance, and wandred through the Woods till Day-break.</p>
               <p>When I got pretty clear, I perceived a large Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain which I conjectured to be that between the Great and Little-Cove, and by the Idea I then formed of the Country and my own Situation, imagined going over it would be the nigheſt Way to the inhabited Parts. As the Road was very bad, and the Mountain at a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Diſtance, it coſt me great Difficulty to reach it; and before I got to the Top, found myſelf ſo feeble, and my Spirits ſo much ſunk, that I was unable to proceed any further: So I lay down, whilſt a cold Sweat poured off me, and I ſuffered all the Agonies of Mind, a Perſon in my Condition (being with Child) could undergo. I continued thus for Half an Hour, when being a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived I reflected that I muſt either endeavour to move farther, or inevitably periſh: I attempted again to climb up, but my feet being all in Bliſters, and the Mountain ſo inacceſſible, that before I had got a Muſquet-ſhot up, found it neceſſary to reſt again: And thus I continued reſting and crawling for about three Hours, till at length I attained the Summit; when I found myſelf ſo much ſpent with Fatigue and want of Food, that I was obliged to throw myſelf flat on my Face, and in that Poſture lay for near an Hour. When I raiſed myſelf up, I eſpied some Cheſtnut Huſks, and was in hopes of finding amongſt them ſome Cheſtnuts; but found that Squirrels or other Vermin had deprived me of that Satisfaction. I then look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed around me in order to diſcover ſome Place that was inhabited, but the Sky was ſo darkned with Smoak, that I could only diſtinguiſh two Houſes in Flames. <q>It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to defcribe the Horror of my Condition in this Place, which was augmented by my not knowing (even
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:007662_0016_102DB9FFCB4DAD40"/>
if I was able) which Side to turn to: Every Place I could lay my Eyes on, ſeemed to be filled with Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and Ruin. A Train of melanchollic Reflections ruſhed on my Mind: I was even weary of Life, and could have wiſhed my Being at an End: Yea I had nigh loaded the Day of my Birth with as many Impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations as <hi>Job:</hi> And aſked, <hi>Why was I reſerved for ſo much Miſery?</hi> It would indeed, have been utterly impoſſible for me to have <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>Having thus given Vent to my Grief, by Tears and Reflection, I thought on returning whence I came; which I did in the beſt Manner I could: But before I had got two Miles, was overtaken by a Horſe, who came after me full Speed, with his Bridle Head and a Bell on, and ſeemed to be very much frighted: I uſed my beſt Endeavours to ſtop and catch him, for I thought if I could once get on Horſe-back, I ſhould be able to make much greater Speed in my future ſearches: But he ſoon made his Way from me, and as I was not in a Condition to follow him, was obliged to drop all Thoughts of that Nature. Whilſt I was thus engaged, I was alarmed by an Indian Holo, by which I judged the Owner of the Horſe had fell a Prey to theſe Blood-thirſty Wretches, and conſequently they could not be far from me: I was now at my Wits-end to find a Place of Shelter, being afraid even to look about me, leſt I might ſee them at my Back: I haſted on with my crawling Speed, till I came to a large Gum Tree, into which I crept, tho' with much Difficulty: It was well however I got in at any Rate, for I heard the Feet of two <hi>Indians,</hi> and ſaw them paſs pretty near me; they were too intent in Purſuit of the Horſe to look much about, which if they had, I ſhould unavoidably have been diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered;
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:007662_0017_102DBA02C92D1730"/>
but as Providence ordered it, I was ſafe, judged it beſt to lie here a conſiderable Time, that ſo the Enemy might get a good Way off. Whilſt I lay here, I heard the Report of two Guns, which was accompanied with a terrible Shriek. <q>Every Moment of my Time now ſeemed precious, and I thought ſo much of it as was ſpent in any one Place, ſave the mere Neceſſity of ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing myſelf from Danger, loſt;</q> ſo I got myſelf out, and wandered better than a Mile through a great Thicket till I came to a ſmall Path, which I gladly purſued, but unfortunately went the wrong Way in it, which I was not ſenſible of, till I had gone about a Mile and a Half, when I found the Path end in the Woods. Now again I was put to a Nonplus, and burſt into Tears at my Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>To wander again in the Wilderneſs ſeemed certain Death, and to return the ſame long Way I came afforded a Proſpect little better; yet maimed as I was, I think I could have chearfully gone many Miles, if I had done it on my Knees, to have met with my Huſband, or any one in a Condition to relieve me: But I was now forlorn in the Wilderneſs, and had no other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort than to ſit down on the cold Earth, indulge my uſual melanchollic Reflections, and bathe my bleeding Feet with my Tears.</q>—This being done, I tore off a few of the remaining Rags (for the Buſhes had nigh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived me of moſt of them) that my mercileſs Ravagers thought not worth taking from me, and with the Hem of my tottered Petticoat (for Gown I had none) tied them round my Feet, and returned the ſame Way, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued my Courſe till I got to a Corn-field, where I found three Ears of Corn: I ſaw ſeveral Stacks of Fod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but was afraid to take up my Lodging in them, leſt when the Indians came that way they might ſet Fire to them; for they ſeem'd to make it a Rule from their firſt ſetting out to deſtroy every Thing of Value they met with: So I took two or three Arm-fulls, carried it to a good Diſtance, and laid it by a Fence, and ſo crept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt it, conjecturing they would not, if they ſaw it,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:007662_0018_102DBA045A0E8840"/>
think it worth their while to ſet Fire to ſo ſmall a Heap; and in this was my Lodging three Days and three Nights nor daring to ſtir much out all that Time, as I repeated<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heard the Report of Guns and Indian Holo's: But indeed, if I had not been prevented through Fear, I was now ſo ſpent and fatigued, that I found it abſolutely neceſſary to ceaſe rambling till I got recruited; though alas! I had but a poor Proſpect of this, for I was almoſt famiſhed to Death, having had nothing to live upon but the three Ears of Indian Corn aforeſaid, and as I knew not when or where to get more, was obliged as it were to count the Grains I eat.</p>
               <p>On the Third Night of my being in this lonely Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I heard a Cock crow and a Dog bark, and next Morning made towards the Place I heard them at; but after I had got the Length of the Field, ſaw three Trees which appeared to be newly ſet on Fire: ſo I lay down about an Hour by the Fence, in which Time I heard 3 Guns go off about a Mile above me: However hearing no more Noiſe, I made towards a Houſe, which apeared on my nearer approach, to be a Stable, all the Houſes being burnt: This Place I found afterwards belonged to one Donaldſon: I here found ſome Fowls, and attempted to catch one of them, but they were too nimble for me; then I went into the Garden, where I made a very plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Meal of green Keal and Parſley: I then went to the Spring, and drank about three Pints of Water) not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeen any for ſeveral Days before) I then crept into the Oven (which was left ſtanding by the Savages) and ſlept pretty ſoundly till Midnight, at which Time I awoke and hearing Cock crow, made to the Stable, and caught one, and dreſſed it by ſome burning Logs of the Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling houſe. But alas the very Smell of the Fowl ſo overcame me, that I was ready to faint ſeveral Times ere it was ready; ſo I put it whole into my Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, and returned to the Oven, where I ſlept till Day when I got out and went again in Search of inhabited Houſes. After I had got about Half a Mile, I heard a Man whiſtle, which at firſt I took to be a white Man's Whiſtle,

but upon liſtening more attentive, had Reaſon to believe it an Indian Decoy; ſo I haſted back to my Lodging, and had not been in it long before I heard the Noiſe of Horſes, and the Voices of ſeveral white Men, which made me look out, and ſeeing one paſs by at ſome Diſtance, I cried out to him for God's ſake to pity my diſtreſſed Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and take me under his Protection: The good Man being ſtartled at my ſudden Appearance, and the ſtrange Figure I cut (being entirely in Rags, and as black as any Chimney-ſweep) preſented his Gun, and if it had not miſs'd Fire, he would certainly have deprived me of that wretched Life I had gone through ſo many Difficulties to preſerve; another of the Company perceiving it, cryed out, <hi>Hold, hold, ſhe is a white Woman by her Voice.</hi> Soon after they all came up to me, and I found them to be a Party of ten Men, ſeparated from a Marſh Creek Great Company of three Hundred. One of them (Mr. <hi>Dickey,</hi>) was ſo kind as to take me up behind him on his Horſe, and after tying me on with a Belt (for I was ſo weak as not to be able to ſit) took me about three Miles to his Houſe, where I got refreſhed with warm Milk, and ſuch Things as I was able to take, and this Morning was brought to this Place; but what is my Aſtoniſhment and Joy when here my Eyes are once more bleſſed with the Sight of my Huſband! [<hi>Surely, they might well cry out with</hi> David, <hi>the devout Pſalmiſt! I cried unto the LORD with my Voice, and he heard me out of his holy Hill.</hi>]</p>
