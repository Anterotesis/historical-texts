            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WHOEVER conſiders the number and extent of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh colonies, on this continent—their climates, ſoil, ports, rivers, riches, and numberleſs advantages—muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of their vaſt importance to Great Britain; and be at a loſs to account for the ignorance concerning them, which prevails in thoſe kingdoms, whence their inhabitants origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſprang. The merchants, indeed, by profitable experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, have not been altogether unacquainted with our trade and our growth; and ſome gentlemen of an inquiſitive turn, by the help of their correſpondents, have obtained the knowledge of many other particulars equally important. But the main body of the people conceive of theſe plantations, under the idea of wild, boundleſs, inhoſpitable, uncultivated deſerts; and hence the puniſhment of a tranſportation hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the judgment of moſt, is thought not much leſs ſevere, than an infamous death. Nay, appealing to facts, we may ſafely aſſert, that even the public boards, to whoſe care theſe extenſive dominions have been more eſpecially committed, attained, but lately, any tolerable acquaintance with their condition. This is the more to be wondered at, as it is natural to imagine, that the king's governors have ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly tranſmitted full accounts of their reſpective pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces. The caſe had been quite otherwiſe. Governments were heretofore too often beſtowed upon men of mean parts, and indigent circumſtances. The former were incapable of the taſk, and the latter too deeply engroſſed by the ſordid views of private intereſt, either to purſue or ſtudy our common
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:024800_0005_0FCD62609CDA2390"/>weal. The worſt conſequences have reſulted from theſe meaſures. Perpetual animoſities being engendered between the governors, and the people ſubjected to their authority; all attempts for conciliating the friendſhip of the Indians, promoting the fur trade, ſecuring the command of the lakes, protecting the frontiers, and extending our poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons far into the inland country, have too often given place to party projects and contracted ſchemes, equally uſeleſs and ſhameful. The conduct of the French has been juſt the reverſe: in ſpite of all the diſadvantages of a cold climate, a long and dangerous navigation up the river of St. Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, a rough, barren, unſettled<note n="*" place="bottom">"Encore moins peuplé." Charlevoix.</note> country, locked up from all communication with the ocean, the greateſt part of the year—I ſay, notwithſtanding theſe difficulties, they have ſeized all the advantages, which we have neglected. The continent, for many hundred leagues, has been thoroughly explored—the main paſſes fortified—innumerable tribes of Indians either won over to their intereſt<note n="†" place="bottom">"Notre nation, la ſeule, qui ait eu le ſecret de gagner l'affection des Ameriquains." Charlevoix.</note> ſubdued, or bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled—the fur trade engroſſed—a communication maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between the extremes of New France—the Britiſh colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies eſtricted to ſcant limits along the ſea ſhore, and noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left remaining for the eſtabliſhment of a vaſt empire, but to open a free water paſſage to the ocean, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the province of New York.</p>
            <p>If the governors of theſe plantations had formerly been animated by the ſame generous and extenſive views, which inſpired mr. Burnet; the long-projected deſigns of our common enemy might, with the aid of Great Britain, have been many years ago ſupplanted, or at leaſt defeated, at a trifling expenſe. But alas! little, too little attention has been had to theſe important affairs, till the late encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the river Ohio, in the province of Pennſylvania, gave the alarm, and the miniſtry were appriſed of the French machinations, by the ſeaſonable repreſentations of general Shirley; and if the colonies have now attracted the notice of his majeſty and his parliament, their grateful acknowledgments are due principally to the noble lord, to whom theſe ſheets are dedicated, for his laudable enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries into their ſtate, and his indefatigable zeal and induſtry for their defence and proſperity.</p>
            <p>At preſent our affairs begin to wear a more ſmiling aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. We are under the guardianſhip of a ſovereign, who
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:024800_0006_0FCD6263B16566A8"/>delights in the welfare of his people; are reſpected by a parliament, affected with a generous ſympathy for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes of their fellow ſubjects, in all their diſperſions; and by a wiſe improvement of the Britiſh aids, it is hoped, we ſhall be able, to retrieve the ill conſequences of our long, reproachful, and inſenſible ſecurity.</p>
            <p>Formerly the colonies were at home diſregarded and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, nor can any other reaſon be aſſigned for it, than that they were unknown. This is, in a great degree, to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to ourſelves. If our governors withheld thoſe infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, which their duty required them to have given, perſons of private characters ought to have undertaken that uſeful and neceſſary taſk. But, except ſome accounts of the ſettlements in the Maſſachuſets bay, and Virginia, all the other hiſtories of our plantations upon the continent, are little elſe than collections of falſehoods, and worſe than none. That this charge againſt thoſe publiſhed concerning this province, in particular, can be fully ſupported, I perſuade myſelf, will inconteſtably appear from the following ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, concerning which I ſhall ſay a few words.</p>
            <p>Having been formerly concerned, according to an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment by act of aſſembly, in a review and digeſt of our provincial laws, it was the duty of myſelf, and my partner in that ſervice, to peruſe the minutes of the council, and the journals of the general aſſembly, from the glorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, at the acceſſion of king William, to the year 1751: and as an acquaintance with our public tranſactions. was a branch of inſtruction, of which a ſtudent for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the law ought not to be ignorant, I have ſince re-examined thoſe entries, beginning with the firſt minutes of council, and read over many of the records in the ſecreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's office. From theſe authentic materials, the following pages were, in a great meaſure, compiled. For many of thoſe parts, which concern our affairs with the French and the Indians, antecedent to the peace of Ryſwick, in 1697, I am bound to make liberal acknowledgments to dr. Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, the author of the hiſtory of the five nations.</p>
            <p>Mr. Alexander, a gentleman eminent in the law, and equally diſtinguiſhed for his humanity, generoſity, great abilities, and honourable ſtations, ſupplied me with ſome uſeful papers; and has left behind him a collection, that will be very ſerviceable to any gentleman, who may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after incline to continue this narrative, through the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations of mr. Coſby, and lieutenant governor Clarke. The draught of this work was unfiniſhed, at the time of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:024800_0007_0FCD626512D59820"/>mr. Alexander's deceaſe<note n="*" place="bottom">He died on the 2d of April, 1756.</note>: and therefore, as it never paſſed under his examination, many important additions are loſt, which his long and intimate acquaintance with the affairs of this province would have enabled him to ſupply.</p>
            <p>When I began to frame this digeſt, it was only intended for private uſe; and the motives which now induce me to publiſh it, are the gratification of the preſent thirſt in Great Britain after American intelligences: contributing, as far as this province is concerned, to an accurate hiſtory of the Britiſh empire<note n="†" place="bottom">As the provinces are different in their conſtitutions, and, with reſpect to government, independent of each other; no general hiſtory of America can be expected, till gentlemen of leiſure, will draw up particular accounts of the reſpective colonies, with which they are acquainted.</note> in this quarter of the world; and the proſpect of doing ſome ſmall ſervice to my country, by laying before the public a ſummary account of its firſt riſe and preſent ſtate.</p>
            <p>Influenced by theſe views, I am not ſo regardleſs of the judgment of others, as not to wiſh it may be, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, acceptable. To pleaſe all ſorts of readers, I know is impoſſible: he, who writes with ſuch hopes, is a ſtranger to human nature, and will be infallibly diſappointed. My deſign is rather to inform than pleaſe. He, who delights only in pages ſhining with illuſtrious characters, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of armies, the riſe and fall of empires, and other grand events, muſt have recourſe to the great authors of antiquity. A detail of the little tranſactions, which concern a colony, ſcant in its juriſdiction, and ſtill ſtruggling with the difficulties naturally attending its infant ſtate, to gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of this taſte can furniſh no entertainment.

The ſacred laws of truth have been infringed neither by poſitive aſſertions, oblique, inſidious hints, wilful ſuppreſſions, or corrupt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentation. To avoid any cenſures of this kind, no reins have been given to a wanton imagination, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of plauſible tales, ſupported only by light probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; but chooſing rather to be honeſt and dull, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable

            <p>CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS, a Genoeſe, employed by Ferdinand and Iſabel, king and queen of Caſtile, was the firſt diſcoverer of America<note n="*" place="bottom">Some authors allege, that Columbus firſt offered his ſervices to the republic of Genoa; then to John II. of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal, and afterwards to our king Henry VII; but this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agrees with lord Bacon's account, who informs us, that Chriſtopher Columbus failed, before his brother Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew had laid the project before the king, which was owing to his falling into the hands of pirates, on his way to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> He failed from St. Lucar, in Auguſt, 1492 and made ſight of one of the Bahama iſlands, on the eleventh of October following.

            <p>On the tenth of April, 1606, king James I. for plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two colonies, paſſed the great North and South Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia patent. To ſir Thomas Gates and others, leave was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to begin a plantation, at any place on the continent, they ſhould think convenient, between the 34th and 41ſt degrees of latitude: and all the lands extending 50 miles,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:024800_0010_0FCD626AED9FF650"/>on each ſide, along the coaſt, 100 miles into the country, and all the iſlands within 100 miles, oppoſite to their plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, were granted in fee, to be called the firſt colony. By the ſame patent, a like quantity was granted to Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Henham, <abbr>eſq</abbr> and others, for a plantation between 38 and 45 degrees of latitude, under the name of the ſecond colony. The firſt began a ſettlement in the great bay (Cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apeak) in 1607. The latter was planted at Plymouth in New-England, 1620.</p>
            <p>Henry Hudſon, an Engliſhman, according to our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, in the year 1608<note n="*" place="bottom">Charlevoix, a French Jeſuit, author of the general hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of New France, thinks this diſcovery was in 1609, Vol. I. 12<hi rend="sup">0</hi>. edition, p. 221. But Stith, Douglaſs, Oldmixen, and other Engliſh writers agree, that Hudſon's firſt voyage was in the preceding year.</note>, under a commiſſion from the king his maſter, diſcovered Long Iſland, New-York, and the river which ſtill bears his name; and afterwards ſold the country, or rather his right, to the Dutch. Their writers contend, that Hudſon was ſent out by the Eaſt-India com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, in 1609, to diſcover a north-weſt paſſage to China; and that having firſt diſcovered Delaware Bay, he came hither, and penetrated up Hudſon's river, as far north as the latitude of 43<hi rend="sup">0</hi>. It is ſaid, however, that there was a ſale, and that the Engliſh objected to it, though they for ſome time neglected to oppoſe the Dutch ſettlement of the country.</p>
            <p>In 1610, Hudſon ſailed again from Holland to this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, called by the Dutch, New-Netherlands; and four years after, the ſtates general granted a patent to ſundry merchants, for an excluſive trade on the North river, who in 1614 built a fort on the weſt ſide, near Albany, which was firſt commanded by Henry Chriſtiaens. Captain Argal was ſent out by ſir Thomas Dale, governor of Virginia, in the ſame year, to diſpoſſeſs the French of the two towns of Port royal and St. Croix, lying on each ſide of the bay of Fundy, in Acadia, then claimed as part of Virginia<note n="†" place="bottom">Charlevoix places this tranſaction in 1613.

            <p>Determined upon the ſettlement of a colony, the ſtates general made a grant of the country, in 1621, to the Weſt-India company. Wouter Van Twiller arrived at fort Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam, now New-York, and took upon himſelf the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, in June, 1629. His ſtyle, in the patents granted by him, was thus, "We, director and council, reſiding in New-Netherland on the iſland Manhattans, under the government of their high mightineſſes, the lords ſtates general of the united Netherlands, and the privileged Weſt-India company." In his time, the New-England planters extended their poſſeſſion weſtward as far as Connecticut river.

            <p>In 1640, the Engliſh, who had overſpread the eaſtern part of Long Iſland, advanced to Oyſterbay. Kieft broke up their ſettlement in 1642, and fitted out two ſloops to drive the Engliſh out of Schuylkill, of which the Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers had lately poſſeſſed themſelves. The inſtructions, dated May 22, to Jan Janſen Alpendam, who commanded in that enterpriſe, are upon record, and ſtrongly aſſert the right of the Dutch, both to the ſoil and trade there.

            <p>We have no account, that the Engliſh acceded to theſe propoſals, nor is it probable, conſidering their ſuperior ſtrength, that they ever did: on the contrary, they daily extended their poſſeſſions; and, in 1642, the colonies of the Maſſachuſet's bay, Plymouth, Connecticut, and New-Haven, entered into a league both againſt the Dutch and Indians, and grew ſo powerful as to meet ſhortly after, upon a deſign of extirpating the former. The Maſſachuſet's bay declined this enterpriſe, which occaſioned a letter to Oliver Cromwell, from William Hooke, dated at New-Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, November 3, 1653, in which he complains of the Dutch, for ſupplying the natives with arms and ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, begs his aſſiſtance with two or three frigates, and that letters might be ſent to the eaſtern colonies, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to join in an expedition againſt the Dutch colony, Oliver's affairs would not admit of ſo diſtant an attempt<note n="*" place="bottom">The war between him and the ſtates, which began in July, 1652, was concluded by a peace on the fifth of April, 1654.

            <p>Peter Stuyveſant was the laſt Dutch governor; and though he had a commiſſion in 1646, he did not begin his adminiſtration till May 27, 1647. The inroads, and claims upon his government, kept him conſtantly employed. New-England on the eaſt, and Maryland, on the weſt, alarmed his fears by their daily increaſe; and about the ſame time, captain Forreſter, a Scotchman, claimed Long Iſland for the dowager of Stirling. The Swedes too were perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incroaching upon Delaware. Through the unſkilfulneſs of the mate, one Deſwyck, a Swediſh captain and ſupercar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, arrived in Raritan river. The ſhip was ſeized, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf made a priſoner at New-Amſterdam. Stuyveſant's rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were theſe. In 1651, the Dutch built fort Caſimir, now called Newcaſtle, on Delaware. The Swedes, indeed, claimed the country, and Printz, their governor, formally proteſted againſt the works. Riſingh, his ſucceſſor, under the diſguiſe of friendſhip, came before the fortreſs, fired two ſalutes, and landed 30 men, who were entertained by
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:024800_0015_0FCD62734F1F8948"/>the commandant as friends: but he had no ſooner diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the weakneſs of the garriſon, than he made himſelf maſter of it, ſeizing alſo upon all the ammunition, houſes, and other effects of the Weſt-India company, and compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſeveral of the people to ſwear allegiance to Chriſtina, queen of Sweden. The Dutch, in 1655, prepared to retake fort Caſimir. Stuyveſant commanded the forces in perſon, and arrived with them in Delaware, the 9th of September. A few days after, he anchored before the garriſon, and landed his troops. The fortreſs was immediately demanded as Dutch property: Suen Scutz, the commandant, deſired leave to conſult Riſingh, which being refuſed, he ſurrender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the 16th of September on articles of capitulation. The whole ſtrength of the place conſiſted of four cannon, four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen pounders, five ſwivels, and a parcel of ſmall arms, which were all delivered to the conquered. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ort Chriſtina was commanded by Riſingh. Stuyveſant came before it, and Riſingh ſurrendered it upon terms, the 25th of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. The country being thus ſubdued, the Dutch governor iſſued a proclamation, in favour of ſuch of the inhabitants, as would ſubmit to the new government, and about 30 Swedes ſwore, "fidelity and obedience to the ſtates general the lords directors of the Weſt-India company, their ſubalterns of the province of New-Netherlands, and the director general then, or thereafter, to be eſtabliſhed." Riſingh and one Elſwych, a trader of note, were ordered to France, or England, and the reſt of the Swediſh inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants to Holland, and from thence to Gottenberg. The Swedes being thus extirpated, the Dutch became poſſeſſed of the weſt ſide of Delaware bay, now called the Three lower counties.</p>
            <p>This country was afterwards under the command of lieutenant-governors, ſubject to the controul of, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned by, the director general at New-Amſterdam. Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han Paul Jaquet was the firſt vice director, or lieutenant-governor, of South river. His ſucceſſors were Alricks, Hino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joſſa, and William Beekman. The poſterity of the laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains amongſt us to this day. Theſe lieutenants had power to grant lands, and their patents make a part of the ancient titles of the preſent poſſeſſors. Alricks' commiſſion, of the 12th of April, 1657, ſhows the extent of the Dutch claim on the weſt ſide of Delaware at that time. He was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed "director general of the colony of the South river of New-Netherlands, and the fortreſs of Caſimir, now called Niewer Amſtel, with all the lands depending thereon, according to the firſt purchaſe and deed of releaſe of the

Of the country northward of the kiln, no mention is made. Orders in 1658 were given to William Beekman to purchaſe Cape Hinlopen from the natives, and to ſettle and fortify it, which, for want of goods, was not done till the ſucceeding year.</p>
            <p>In the year 1659, freſh troubles aroſe from the Maryland claim to the lands on South river: and in September, colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Nathaniel Utie, as commiſſioner from Fendal, lord Balti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more's governor, arrived at Niewer Amſtel from Maryland. The country was ordered to be evacuated, lord Baltimore claiming all the land, between 38 and 40 degrees of lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, from ſea to ſea. Beekman and his council demanded evidence of his lordſhip's right, and offered to prove the ſtates general's grant to the Weſt-India company, their payment to them, for the land and poſſeſſion; and upon the whole, propoſed to refer the controverſy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner, notwithſtanding, a few days after, warned him to draw off, beyond latitude 40°: but Beekman diſregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the threat. Colonel Utie thereupon returned to Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and an immediate invaſion was expected.</p>
            <p>Early in the ſpring of the year 1660, Nicholas Varleth, and Brian Newton, were diſpatched from fort Amſterdam, to Virginia, in quality of ambaſſadors, with full power to open a trade, and conclude a league, offenſive and defenſive, againſt the barbarians. William Berckley, the governor, gave them a kind reception, and approved their propoſal of peace and commerce, which ſir Henry Moody was ſent here to agree upon and perfect. Four articles, to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, were drawn up, and ſent to the governor for confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. Stuyveſant artfully endeavoured, at this treaty, to procure an acknowledgment of the Dutch title to the country, which Berckley as carefully avoided. This was his anſwer.</p>

            <p>Governor Stuyveſant was a faithful ſervant to the Weſt-India company: this is abundantly proved by his letters to them, exciting their care of the colony. In one, dated April 20, 1660, which is very long and pathetic, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the deſperate ſituation of affairs on both ſides of the New-Netherland, he writes, "your honours ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that the troubles in England will prevent any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt on theſe parts: alas! they are ten to one in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to us, and are able, without any aſſiſtance, to deprive us of the country when they pleaſe." On the 25th of June, the ſame year, he informs them, "that the demands, encroachments, and uſurpations, of the Engliſh, give the people here great concern. The right to both rivers, ſays he, by purchaſe and poſſeſſion, is our own, without diſpute. We apprehend, that they, our more powerful neighbours, lay their claims under a royal patent, which we are unable hitherto to do in your name<note n="*" place="bottom">If we ſhould argue, from this letter, that the Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia company had no grants of the New Netherlands, from the ſtates general, as ſome ſuppoſe, we diſcredit De Laet's hiſtory, dedicated to the ſtates in 1624, as well as all the Dutch writers, and even Stuyveſant himſelf, who in his letter to Richard Nicolls, at the ſurrender, aſſerts that they had a grant, and ſhowed it under ſeal to the Engliſh depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. But the genuine conſtruction of the Dutch governor's letter, is this, that in 1660, he had not the patent to the Weſt-India company, to lay before the Engliſh in America, who diſputed the Dutch right to this country.</note> Colonel
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:024800_0018_0FCD627B1BC8D6B8"/>Utie being unſucceſsful the laſt year, in his embaſſy for the evacuation of the Dutch poſſeſſions on Delaware, lord Balti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, in autumn 1660, applied, by captain Neal, his agent, to the Weſt-India company, in Holland, for an order on the inhabitants of South river, to ſubmit to his authority, which they abſolutely refuſed, aſſerting their right to that part of their colony.</p>
            <p>The Engliſh, from New-England, were every day en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching upon the Dutch. The following letter, from Stuyveſant to the Weſt-India company, dated July 21, 1661, ſhows the ſtate of the colony at that time, on both ſides. "We have not yet begun the fort on Long-Iſland, near Oyſterbay, becauſe our neighbours lay the boundaries a mile and a half more weſterly, than we do; and the more, as your honours, by your advice of December 24, are not inclined to ſtand by the treaty of Hartford, and propoſe to ſue for redreſs on Long Iſland and the Freſh Water river, by means of the ſtates' ambaſſador. Lord Sterling is ſaid to ſolicit a confirmation of his right to all Long Iſland, and importunes the preſent king, to confirm the grant made by his royal father, which is affirmed to be already obtained. But more probable, and material, is the advice from Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, that lord Baltimore's patent, which contains the ſouth part of South river, is confirmed by the king and publiſhed in print: that lord Baltimore's natural brother, who is a rigid papiſt, being made governor there, has received lord Baltimore's claim, and proteſt to your honours in council, (where with he ſeems but little ſatisfied) and has now more hopes of ſucceſs. We have advice from England, that there is an invaſion intended againſt theſe parts, and the country ſolicited of the king, the duke and the parliament, is to be annexed to their dominions; and for that purpoſe, they deſire three or four frigates, perſuading the King, that the company poſſeſſed and held this country under an unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful title, having only obtained of king James, leave for a watering place on Staten Iſland, in 1623."</p>
            <p>In Auguſt 1663, a ſhip arrived from Holland at South river, with new planters, ammunition, and implements of huſbandry. Lord Baltimore's ſon landed a little after, and was entertained by Beekman at Niewer Amſtel. This was Charles, the ſon of Cecilius, who in 1661, had procured a grant and confirmation of the patent, paſſed in favour of
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:024800_0019_0FCD627CE6B13E30"/>his father in 1632. The papiſtical principles of the Balti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more family, the charge of colonizing, the parliamentary was with Charles I. and Oliver's uſurpation, all conſpired to impede the ſettlement of Maryland, till the year 1661. And theſe conſiderations account for the extenſion of the Dutch limits, on the weſt ſide of Delaware bay.</p>
            <p>While the Dutch were contending with their European neighbours, they had the art always to maintain a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the natives, until the war which broke out this year with the Indians at Eſopus, now Ulſter county. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, however, but a ſhort ſeaſon. The five nations never gave them any diſturbance, which was owing to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual wars with the French, who ſettled at Canada, in 1603. I have before obſerved, that Oliver Cromwell was applied to, for his aid in the reduction of this country, and that his ſon Richard took ſome ſteps towards accompliſhing the ſcheme. The work was however reſerved for the reign of Charles II. an indolent prince, and entirely given up to pleaſure, who was driven to it, more, perhaps, by the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences then ſubſiſting between England and Holland, than by any motive that might reflect honour upon his prudence, activity, and public ſpirit. Before this expedition, the king granted a patent, on the 12th of March, 1664, to his brother the duke of York and Albany, for ſundry tracts of land in America, the boundaries of which, becauſe they have given riſe to important and animated debates, it may not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to tranſcribe.</p>
            <p>"All that part of the main land of New-England, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at a certain place, called or known by the name of St. Croix, next adjoining to New-Scotland in America, and from thence extending along the ſea coaſt, unto a certain place called Pemaquie, or Pemequid, and ſo up the river thereof, to the furtheſt head of the ſame, as it tendeth northward; and extending from thence, to the river of Kimbequin, and ſo upwards, by the ſhorteſt courſe, to the river Canada, northward: and alſo all that iſland, or iſlands, commonly called by the ſeveral name or names of Meito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wacks, or Long Iſland, ſituate and being towards the weſt of cape Cod, and the narrow Higanſetts, abutting upon the main land, between the two rivers, there called or known by the ſeveral names of Connecticut and Hudſon's river, together alſo with the ſaid river, called Hudſon's river, and all the land from the weſt ſide of Connecticut river, to the eaſt ſide of Delaware bay, and alſo, all thoſe ſeveral iſlands, called or known by the names of Martin's Vineyard, or Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuck's, otherwiſe Nantucket: together, &amp;c."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:024800_0020_0FCD627DD3EC4BC8"/>
Part of this tract was conveyed by the duke, to John Lord Berkley, baron of Stratton, and ſir George Carteret, of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum, in Devon, who were then members of the king's council. The leaſe was for the conſideration of ten ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and dated the 23d of June, 1664. The releaſe, dated the next day, mentions no particular ſum of money, as a conſideration for the grant of the lands, which have the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing deſcription.</p>
            <p>"All that tract of land, adjacent to New-England, and lying and being to the weſtward of Long Iſland, and bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the eaſt part by the main ſea, and part by Hudſon's river; and hath, upon the weſt, Delaware bay, or river, and extendeth ſouthward, to the main ocean as far as Cape May, at the mouth of Delaware bay: and to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as far as the northermoſt branch of the ſaid bay or river of Delaware, which is forty one degrees and forty minutes of latitude: which ſaid tract of land is hereafter to be called by the name, or names, of Nova Caeſarea, or New-Jerſey."</p>
            <p>Thus the New Netherlands became divided into New-Jerſey, ſo called after the iſle of Jerſey, in compliment to ſir George Carteret, whoſe family came from thence; and New York, which took its name in honour of the duke of York.</p>
            <p>The Dutch inhabitants by the vigilance of their governor, were not unappriſed of the deſigns of the Engliſh court againſt them; for their records teſtify, that on the 8th of July, "the general received intelligence, from one Thomas Willet, an Engliſhman, that an expedition was preparing in England, againſt this place, conſiſting of two frigates of 40 and 50 guns, and a fly boat of 40 guns, having on board 300 ſoldiers, and each frigate 150 men, and that they then lay at Portſmouth, waiting for a wind." News arrived alſo from Boſton, that they had already ſet ſail. The burgomaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were thereupon called into council. The fortreſs was ordered to be put into a poſture of defence, and ſpies ſent to Milford and Weſt-cheſter for intelligence. Boſton was in the ſecret of the expedition; for the general court had, in May preceding, paſſed a vote for a ſupply of proviſions, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards refreſhing the ſhips on their arrival. They were four in number, and reſolved to rendezvous at Gardener's iſland, in the Sound, but parted in a fog, about the 20th of July. Richard Nicolls, and ſir George Carteret, two of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, were on board the Guyny, and fell in firſt with Cape Cod. The winds having blown from the ſouth weſt, the other ſhips, with ſir Robert Carr, and mr. Mavenick,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:024800_0021_0FCD627F9803DF78"/>the remaining commiſſioners, were rightly concluded to be driven to the eaſtward. After diſpatching a letter to mr. Winthrop, the governor of Connecticut, requeſting his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, col. Nicolls proceeded to Namaſket, and thence to Boſton. The other ſhips got into Piſcataway. John Endicot, a very old man, was then governor of Boſton, and incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of buſineſs. The commiſſioners, therefore, had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with the council, and earneſtly implored the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that colony. Col. Nicolls and ſir George Carteret, in their letter from Boſton, to ſir H. Bennet, ſecretary of ſtate, complain much of the backwardneſs of that province. The reaſons urged in their excuſe, were poverty and the ſeaſon, it being the time of harveſt; but perhaps diſaffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Stuart family, whoſe perſecuting fury had driven them from their native country, was the true ſpring of their conduct. The king's ſucceſs in the reduction of the Dutch, evidently opened him a door, to come at his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in New-England, who were far from being few<note n="*" place="bottom">T. Dixwell, <abbr>eſq</abbr> one of Charles I.'s judges, and excepted out of the general pardon, lived many years at New-Haven (incog.) in quality of a country merchant: ſir Edmond Androſs, in one of his tours through the colony of Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticut, ſaw him there at church, and ſtrongly ſuſpected him to be one of the regicides. In his laſt illneſs, he revealed himſelf to the miniſter of the town, and ordered a ſmall ſtone to be ſet at the head of his grave, which I have often ſeen there, inſcribed, T. D. <abbr>eſq</abbr> While at New-Haven, he went under the name of John Davis.</note>; and whether this conſideration might not have given riſe to the project itſelf, I leave to the conjectures of others.</p>
            <p>On the 27th of July, Nicolls and Carteret made a formal requeſt in writing, "That the government of Boſton would paſs an act to furniſh them with armed men, who ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin their march to the Manhattans, on the 20th of Auguſt enſuing, and promiſed, that if they could get other aſſiſtance, they would give them an account of it." The governor and council anſwered, that they would aſſemble the general court, and communicate the propoſal to them.</p>
            <p>From Boſton, a ſecond letter was written to governor Winthrop, in Connecticut, dated the 29th of July, in which he was informed, that the other ſhips were then arrived, and would ſail with the firſt fair wind; and he was deſired to meet them at the weſt end of Long-Iſland.</p>
            <p>One of the ſhips entered the bay of the North river, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:024800_0022_0FCD62824EC15030"/>days before the reſt; and as ſoon as they were all come up, Stuyveſant ſent a letter, dated ⅓ 9/0 of Auguſt, at fort Anil, directed to the commanders of the Engliſh fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, by John Declyer, one of the chief council, the rev. John Megapolenſis, miniſter, Paul Lunder Vander Grilft, major, and mr. Samuel Megapolenſis, doctor in phyſic, with the utmoſt civility, to deſire the reaſon of their approach, and continuing in the harbour of Naijarlij, without giving notice to the Dutch, which (he writes) they ought to have done.</p>
            <p>Col. Nicolls anſwered the next day with a ſummons.</p>

            <p>Mr. Stuyveſant promiſed an anſwer to the ſummons the next morning, and in the mean time convened the council and burgomaſters. The Dutch governor was a good ſoldier, and had loſt a leg in the ſervice of the ſtates. He would willingly have made a defence; and refuſed a ſight of the ſummons, both to the inhabitants and burgomaſters, leſt the eaſy terms offered, might induce them to capitulate. The latter, however, inſiſted upon a copy, that they might communicate it to the late magiſtrates and principal burghers. They called together the inhabitants at the ſtadt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, and acquainted them with the governor's refuſal. Governor Winthrop, at the ſame time, wrote to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector and his council, ſtrongly recommending a ſurrender. On the 22d of Auguſt, the burgomaſters came again into council, and deſired to know the contents of the Engliſh meſſage from governor Winthrop, which Stuyveſant ſtill refuſed. They continued their importunity; and he, in a fit of anger, tore it to piecee: upon which they proteſted againſt the act, and all its conſequences.

But that his majeſty hath an indiſputable right, to all the lands in the north parts of America, is that, which the kings of France and Spain will diſallow, as we abſolutely do, by virtue of a commiſſion given to me, by my lords, the high and mighty ſtates ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, to be governor general, over New-Holland, the iſle

Moreover, it is without diſpute, and acknowledged by the world, that our predeceſſors, by virtue of the commiſſion and patent of the ſaid lords, the ſtates general, have, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controul and peaceably (the contrary never coming to our knowledge) enjoyed fort Orange, about 48 or 50 years, the Manhattans about 41 or 42 years, the South river 40 years, and the Freſh Water river about 36 years.</p>

Beſides what hath been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, there is little probability, that his ſaid majeſty of England (in regard the articles of peace are printed, and were recommended to us to obſerve ſeriouſly and exactly, by a letter written to us by our ſaid lords, the ſtates general, and to cauſe them to be obſerved religiouſly in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try) would give order touching ſo dangerous a deſign, being alſo ſo apparent, that none other than my ſaid lords, the ſtates general, have any right to theſe provinces, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently ought to command and maintain their ſubjects, and in their abſence, we, the governor general, are obliged to maintain their rights, and to repel and take revenge of all threatenings, unjuſt attempts, or any force whatſoever, that ſhall be committed againſt their faithful ſubjects and inhabitants; it being a very conſiderable thing, to affront ſo mighty a ſtate, although it were not againſt an ally and confederate. Conſequently, if his ſaid majeſty (as it is fit) were well informed, of all that could be ſpoken upon this ſubject, he would not approve of what expreſſions were mentioned in your letter; which are, that you are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by his majeſty, to demand in his name, ſuch places and fortreſſes as are in the poſſeſſion of the Dutch under my government; which, as it appears by my commiſſion before mentioned, was given me by my lords, the high and mighty ſtates general. And there is leſs ground in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs demand of my government, ſince all the world knows, that about three years ago, ſome Engliſh frigates being on the coaſt of Africa, upon a pretended commiſſion,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:024800_0026_0FCD628D0713EF78"/>they did demand certain places under the government of our ſaid lords, the ſtates general, as Cape Vert, river of Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo, and all other places in Guyny, to them belonging. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which, our ſaid lords, the ſtates general, by virtue of the articles of peace, having made appear the ſaid attempt to his majeſty of England, they received a favourable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, his ſaid majeſty diſallowing all ſuch acts of hoſtility, as might have been done, and, beſides, gave order, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution ſhould be made, to the Eaſt India company, of whatſoever had been pillaged, in the ſaid river of Gambo; and likewiſe reſtored them to their trade, which makes us think it neceſſary, that a more expreſs order ſhould appear unto us, as a ſufficient warrant for us, towards my lords, the high and mighty ſtates general, ſince by virtue of our ſaid commiſſion, we do, in theſe provinces, repreſent them, as belonging to them, and not to the king of Great Britain, except his ſaid majeſty, upon better grounds, make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to our ſaid lords, the ſtates general, againſt which they may defend themſelves, as they ſhall think fit. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude: we cannot but declare unto you, though the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors and commiſſioners of his majeſty have divers times quarrelled with us, about the bounds of the juriſdiction or the high and mighty the ſtates general, in theſe parts, yet they never queſtioned their juriſdiction itſelf; on the contrary, in the year 1650, at Hartford, and the laſt year at Boſton, they treated with us upon this ſubject, which is a ſufficient proof, that his majeſty hath never been well-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, of the equity of our cauſe, inſomuch as we cannot imagine, in regard of the articles of peace, between the crown of England and the ſtates general, (under whom there are ſo many ſubjects in America, as well as Europe) that his ſaid majeſty of Great-Britain would give a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to moleſt and endamage the ſubjects of my ſaid lords, the ſtates general, eſpecially ſuch, as ever ſince 50, 40, and the lateſt 36 years, have quietly enjoyed their lands, countries, forts, and inheritances: and leſs, that his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects would attempt any acts of hoſtility, or violence againſt them: and in caſe that you will act by force of arms, we proteſt and declare, in the name of our ſaid lords, the ſtates general, before God and men, that you will act an unjuſt violence, and a breach of the articles of peace, ſo ſolemnly ſworn, agreed upon, and ratified by his majeſty of England, and my lords, the ſtates general, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for that to prevent the ſhedding of blood, in the month of February laſt, we treated with captain John. Scott, (who reported he had a commiſſion from his ſaid majeſty) touching the limits of Long Iſland, and concluded for the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:024800_0027_0FCD6290154CD1E0"/>ſpace of a year; that in the mean time, the buſineſs might be treated on between the king of Great Britain, and my lords, the high and mighty ſtates general: and again, at preſent, for the hindrance and prevention of all differences, and the ſpilling of innocent blood, not only in theſe parts, but alſo in Europe, we offer unto you, a treaty by our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties, mr. Cornelius Van Ruyven, ſecretary, and receiver of New Holland, Cornelius Steenwick, burgomaſter, mr. Samuel Megapolenſis, doctor of phyſic, and mr. James Couſſeau, heretofore ſheriff. As touching the threats in your concluſion, we have nothing to anſwer, only that we fear nothing, but what God (who is as juſt as merciful) ſhall lay upon us; all things being in his gracious diſpoſal, and we may as well be preſerved by him, with ſmall forces, as by a great army, which makes us to wiſh you all happineſs and proſperity, and recommend you to his protection. My lords, your thrice humble and affectionate ſervant and friend, ſigned, P. Stuyveſant.—At the fort at Amſterdam, the ſecond of September, new ſtile, 1664."</p>
                  <p>While the Dutch governor and council were contending with the burgomaſters and people in the city, the Engliſh commiſſioners publiſhed a proclamation<note n="*" place="bottom">It was in theſe words: "Foraſmuch as his majeſty hath ſent us (by commiſſion under his great ſeal of England) amongſt other things, to expel, or to reduce to his majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's obedience all ſuch foreigners as without his majeſty's leave and conſent, have ſeated themſelves amongſt any of his dominions in America, to the prejudice of his majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's ſubjects, and diminution of his royal dignity; we, his ſaid majeſty's commiſſioners, do declare and promiſe, that whoſoever, of what nation ſoever, will, upon knowledge of this proclamation, acknowledge and teſtify themſelves, to ſubmit to this his majeſty's government, as his good ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, ſhall be protected in his majeſty's laws and juſtice, and peaceably enjoy whatſoever God's bleſſing, and their own honeſt induſtry, have furniſhed them with; and all other privileges, with his majeſty's Engliſh ſubjects. We have cauſed this to be publiſhed, that we might prevent all inconveniencies to others, if it were poſſible: however, to clear ourſelves from the charge of all thoſe miſeries, that may any way befall ſuch as live here, and will [not] ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his majeſty for their ſovereign, whom God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve."</note> in the country, encouraging the inhabitants to ſubmit, and promiſing them
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:024800_0028_0FCD6291CFB57818"/>the king's protection, and all the privileges of ſubjects: and as ſoon as they diſcovered by Stuyveſant's letter, that he was averſe to the ſurrender, officers were ſent to beat up for volunteers in Middleborough, Uliſſen, Jamaica, and Hemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted. A warrant was alſo iſſued to Hugh Hide, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the ſquadron, to proſecute the reduction of the fort; and an Engliſh ſhip, then trading here, was preſſed into the ſervice. Theſe preparations induced Stuyveſant to write another letter, on the 25th of Auguſt, old ſtyle, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, though he declares that he would ſtand the ſtorm, yet to prevent the ſpilling of blood, he had ſent John de Decker, counſellor of ſtate, Cornelius Van Riven, ſecretary and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, Cornelius Steenwyck, major, and James Couſſeau, ſheriff, to conſult, if poſſible, an accommodation. Nicolls, who knew the diſpoſition of the people, anſwered imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from Graveſend, that he would treat about nothing but a ſurrender. The Dutch governor, the next day, agreed to a treaty and ſurrender, on condition the Engliſh and Dutch limits in America, were ſettled by the crown and the ſtates general. The Engliſh deputies were, ſir Robert Carr, George Carteret, John Winthrop, governor of Connecticut, Samuel Wyllys, one of the aſſiſtants or council of that colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and Thomas Clarke, and John Pynchon, commiſſioners from the general court of the Maſſachuſetts bay, who, but a little before, brought an aid from that province. What theſe perſons agreed upon, Nicolls promiſed to ratify. At eight o'clock in the morning, of the 27th of Auguſt, 1664, the commiſſioners, on both ſides, met at the governor's farm, and there ſigned the following articles of capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Theſe articles following were conſented to by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons hereunder ſubſcribed, at the governor's bowery, Aug. the 27th, old ſtile, 1664.</p>

                     <item>IV. If any inhabitant have a mind to remove himſelf, he ſhall have a year and ſix weeks from this day, to remove

                     <item>V. If any officer of ſtate, or public miniſter of ſtate, have a mind to go for England, they ſhall be tranſported fraught free, in his majeſty's frigates, when theſe frigates ſhall return thither.</item>
                     <item>VI. It is conſented to, that any people may freely come from the Netherlands, and plant in this colony, and that Dutch veſſels may freely come hither, and any of the Dutch may freely return home, or ſend any ſort of merchandize home, in veſſels of their own country.</item>
                     <item>VII. All ſhips from the Netherlands, or any other place, and goods therein, ſhall be received here, and ſent hence, after the manner which formerly they were, before our coming hither, for ſix months next enſuing.</item>

That the townſmen of the Manhattans, ſhall not have any ſoldiers quartered upon them, without being ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied and paid for them by their officers; and that at this preſent, if the fort be not capable of lodging all the ſoldiers, then the burgomaſter, by his officers, ſhall appoint ſome houſes capable to receive them.</item>
                     <item>XI. The Dutch here ſhall enjoy their own cuſtoms concerning their inheritances.</item>
                     <item>XII.

                     <item>XIII. No judgment that has paſſed any judicature here, ſhall be called in queſtion; but if any conceive, that he hath not had juſtice done him, if he apply himſelf to the ſtates general, the other party ſhall be bound to anſwer for the ſuppoſed injury.</item>
                     <item>XIV.

                     <item>XV. If it do appear, that there is a public engagement
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:024800_0030_0FCD62949496C080"/>of debt, by the town of the Manhattoes, and a way agreed on for the ſatisfying of that engagement, it is agreed, that the ſame way propoſed ſhall go on, and that the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall be ſatisfied.</item>
                     <item>XVI. All inferior civil officers and magiſtrates, ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue as now they are, (if they pleaſe) till the cuſtomary time of new elections: and then new ones to be choſen by themſelves, provided that ſuch new choſen magiſtrates ſhall take the oath of allegiance to his majeſty of England, before they enter upon their office.</item>

                     <item>XIX.

                     <item>XX. If at any time hereafter, the king of Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and the ſtates of the Netherland do agree that this place and country be re-delivered into the hands of the ſaid ſtates, whenſoever his majeſty will ſend his commands to re-deliver it, it ſhall immediately be done.</item>

If there be any ſoldiers that will go into Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and if the company of Weſt-India in Amſterdam, or any private perſons here, will tranſport them into Holland, then they ſhall have a ſafe paſſport from col.

            <p>Theſe articles, favourable as they were to the inhabitants, were however very diſagreeable to the Dutch governor; and he therefore refuſed to ratify them, till two days after they were ſigned by the commiſſioners.</p>
            <p>The town of New-Amſterdam, upon the reduction of the iſland Manhattans, took the name of New-York. It conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of ſeveral ſmall ſtreets, laid out in the year 1656, and was not inconſiderable for the number of its houſes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants. The eaſy terms of the capitulation, promiſed their peaceable ſubjection to the new government; and hence we find, that in two days after the ſurrender, the Boſton aid was diſmiſſed, with the thanks of the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners to the general court. Hudſon's and the South river were, however, ſtill to be reduced. Sir Robert Carr com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the expedition on Delaware, and Carteret was commiſſioned to ſubdue the Dutch at fort Orange. The garriſon capitulated on the 24th of September, and he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it Albany, in honour of the duke. While Carteret was here, he had an interview with the Indians of the five na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and entered into a league of friendſhip with them, which remarkably continues to this day<note n="*" place="bottom">The Dutch were ſenſible of the importance of preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an uninterrupted amity with thoſe Indians, for they were both very numerous and warlike. The French pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued quite different meaſures, and the irruptions of thoſe tribes, according to their own authors, have often reduced Canada to the brink of ruin.</note>. Sir Robert Carr was equally ſucceſsful on South river; for he compelled both
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:024800_0032_0FCD629BA3ED4018"/>the Dutch and Swedes, to capitulate and deliver up their garriſons the firſt of October, 1664; and that was the day in which the whole New-Netherlands became ſubject to the Engliſh crown. Very few of the inhabitants thought proper to remove out of the country. Governor Stuyveſant him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf held his eſtate, and died here. His remains were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a chapel, which he had erected on his own farm, at a ſmall diſtance from the city, now poſſeſſed by his grandſon Gerardus Stuyveſant, a man of probity, who has been elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the magiſtracy, above thirty years ſucceſſively. Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice obliges me to declare, that for loyalty to the preſent reigning family, and a pure attachment to the proteſtant religion, the deſcendents of the Dutch planters, are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps exceeded by none of his majeſty's ſubjects.</p>

            <p>RICHARD NICOLLS being now poſſeſſed of the country, took the government upon him, under the ſtile of "deputy-governor under his royal highneſs the duke of York, of all his territories in America." During his ſhort continuance here, he paſſed a vaſt number of grants and confirmations of the ancient Dutch patents, the profits of which muſt have been very conſiderable. Among theſe, no one has occaſioned more animated contention, than that called the Elizabethtown grant, in New-Jerſey; which, as it relates to another colony, I ſhould not have mentioned, but for the opportunity to caution the reader againſt the repreſentation of that controverſy contained in Douglaſs's ſummary. I have ſufficient reaſons to juſtify my charging that account with partiality and miſtakes; and for proofs, refer to the printed anſwer in chancery, publiſhed in the year 1751.</p>

At the time of this determination, about two thirds of Long Iſland were poſſeſſed by people from New-England, who had gradually encroached upon the Dutch. As to the ſettlement between New York and Connecticut on the main, it has always been conſidered by the former, as founded upon ignorance and fraud<note n="*" place="bottom">The town of Rye was ſettled under Connecticut; and the grant from that colony is bounded by this line of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion.</note>. The ſtation at Mama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneck was about 30 miles from New York, from Albany 150. The general courſe of the river is about north 12 or 150 eaſt: and hence it is evident, that a north-north-weſt line will ſoon interſect the river, and conſequently leave the Dutch country, but a little before ſurrendered to col. Carteret, out of the province of New-York. It has been generally eſteemed, that the Connecticut commiſſioners in this affair, took advantage of the duke's agents, who were ignorant of the geography of the country.</p>
            <p>About the cloſe of the year, the eſtate of the Weſt-India company was ſeized and confiſcated, hoſtilities being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually commenced in Europe as well as America, though no declarations of war had yet been publiſhed by either of the contending parties. A great diſpute between the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Jamaica on Long Iſland, which was adjuſted by col. Nicolls, on the 2d of January, 1665, gave riſe to a ſalutary inſtitution, which has in part obtained ever ſince. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy reſpected Indian deeds; and thenceforth it was ordained, that no purchaſe from the Indians, without the governor's licenſe, executed in his preſence, ſhould be valid. The ſtrength and numbers of the natives rendered it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to purchaſe their rights; and to prevent their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſelling the ſame tract, it was expedient, that the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ſhould be attended with ſome conſiderable ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>Another inſtance of col. Nicolls's prudence, was his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual introduction of the Engliſh methods of government. It was not till the 12th of June, this year, that he incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the inhabitants of New York, under the care of a mayor, five aldermen, and a ſheriff. Till this time, the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was ruled by a ſcout, burgomaſters, and ſchepens.</p>
            <p>In March preceding, there was a great convention, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the governor at Hempſtead, of two deputies from every town on Long Iſland, empowered to bind their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituents. The deſign of their meeting was to adjuſt the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:024800_0036_0FCD62A28F7B70A0"/>of their townſhips for the preſervation of the public peace.</p>
            <p>The war being proclaimed at London, on the fourth of this month, Nicolls received the account of it in June, with a letter from the lord chancellor, informing him, that de Ruyter, the Dutch admiral, had orders to viſit New York. His lordſhip was miſinformed, or the admiral was diverted from the enterpriſe; for the Engliſh peaceably held the poſſeſſion of the country during the whole war, which was concluded on the 21ſt of July, 1667, by the treaty of Broda. Some are of opinion, that the exchange made with the Dutch for Surinam, which they had taken from us, was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to the nation: but theſe judges do not conſider, that it would have been impoſſible for the Dutch to have preſerved this colony againſt the increaſing ſtrength of the people in New-England, Maryland, and Virginia.</p>
            <p>After an adminiſtration of three years, Nicolls returned to England. The time, during his ſhort reſidence here, was almoſt wholly taken up in confirming the ancient Dutch grants. He erected no courts of juſtice, but took upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the ſole deciſion of all controverſies whatſoever. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints came before him by petition; upon which he gave a day to the parties, and, after a ſummary hearing, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced judgment. His determinations were called edicts, and executed by the ſheriffs he had appointed. It is much to his honour, that notwithſtanding all this plenitude of power, he governed the province with integrity and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. A repreſentation from the inhabitants of Long Iſland, to the general court of Connecticut, made about the time of the revolution, commends him as a man of an eaſy and benevolent diſpoſition: and this teſtimonial is the more to be relied upon, becauſe the deſign of the writers, was by a detail of their grievances, to induce the colony of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut to take them under its immediate protection.</p>
            <p>Francis Lovelace, a colonel, was appointed by the duke, to ſucceed Nicolls in the government of the province, which he began to exerciſe in May, 1667. As he was a man of g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eat moderation, the people lived very peaceably under him, till the re-ſurrender of the colony, which put an end to his power, and is the only event, that ſignalized his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration.</p>
            <p>The ambitious deſigns of Louis XIV. againſt the Dutch, gave riſe to our war with the ſtates general in 1672. Charles II. a prince ſunk in pleaſures, proſligate, and poor, was eaſily detached from his alliance with the Dutch, by the intrigues and pecuniary promiſes of the French king. The
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:024800_0037_0FCD62A6CF52AF08"/>following paſſage from a fine writer<note n="*" place="bottom">Voltaire's age of Louis XIV.</note>, ſhows that his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences for entering into the war, were perfectly groundleſs and trifling.</p>
            <p>"The king of England, on his ſide, reproached them with diſreſpect, in not directing their fleet to lower the flag be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an Engliſh ſhip: and they were alſo accuſed in regard to a certain picture, wherein Cornelius de Witt, brother to the penſionary, war painted with the attributes of a conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. Ships were repreſented in the back ground of the piece, either taken or burnt. Cornelius de Witt, who had really had a great ſhare in the maritime exploits againſt England, had permitted this trifling memorial of his glory: but the picture, which was in a manner unknown, was depoſited in a chamber wherein ſcarce any body ever entered. The Engliſh miniſters, who preſented the complaints of their king againſt Holland, in writing, therein mentioned certain abuſive pictures. The ſtates, who always tranſlated the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials of ambaſſadors into French, having rendered abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, by the words <hi>fautifs trompeurs,</hi> they replied, that they did not know what theſe <hi>roguiſh pictures (ces tableaux trompeurs)</hi> were. In reality, it never in the leaſt entered into their thoughts, that it concerned this portrait of one of their citizens; nor did they ever conceive this could be a pretence for declaring war."</p>
            <p>A few Dutch ſhips arrived the year after, on the 30th of July, under Staten iſland, at the diſtance of a few miles from the city of New York. John Manning, a captain of an independent company, had at that time the command of the fort, and by a meſſenger, ſent down to the ſquadron, treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erouſly made his peace with the enemy. On that very day, the Dutch ſhips came up, moored under the fort, landed their men, and entered the garriſon, without giving or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a ſhot. A council of war was afterwards held at the ſtadt houſe, at which were preſent</p>
            <p>Cornelius Evertſe, jun, Jacob Benkes, commodores. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony Colve, Nicholas Bowes, Abraham Ferd. Van Zyll, captains.</p>
            <p>All the magiſtrates and conſtables from Eaſt Jerſey, Long Iſland, Eſopus, and Albany, were immediately ſummoned to New York; and the major part of them ſwore allegiance to the ſtates general, and the prince of Orange. Col. Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace was ordered to depart the province, but afterwards ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained leave to return to England with commodore Benkes.
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:024800_0038_0FCD62A7D6DA99E8"/>It has often been inſiſted on, that this conqueſt did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the whole province of New-Jerſey; but upon what foundation, I cannot diſcover. From the Dutch records, it appears, that deputies were ſent by the people inhabiting the country, even ſo far weſtward as Delaware river, who, in the name of their principals, made a declaration of their ſubmiſſion; in return for which, certain privileges were granted to them, and three judicatories erected at Niewer Amſtel, Upland, and Hoer Kill. Colve's commiſſion to be governor of this country is worth printing, becauſe it ſhows the extent of the Dutch claims. The tranſlation runs thus:</p>

            <p>The Dutch governor enjoyed his office but a very ſhort ſeaſon; for on the 9th of February, 1674, the treaty of peace between England and the ſtates general was ſigned at Weſtminſter; the ſixth article of which, reſtored this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to the Engliſh. The terms of it were generally, "that whatſoever countries, iſlands, towns, ports, caſtles, or forts, have or ſhall be taken on both ſides, ſince the time that the late unhappy war broke out, either in Europe or elſewhere, ſhall be reſtored to the former lord and proprietor, in the ſame condition they ſhall be in, when the peace itſelf ſhall be proclaimed; after which time, there ſhall be no ſpoil nor plunder of the inhabitants, no demolition of fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nor carrying away of guns, powder or military ſtores, which belonged to any caſtle or fort, at the time when it was taken."</p>
            <p>The lenity, which began the adminiſtration of col. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colls, was continued under Lovelace. He appears to have been a man, rather of a phlegmatic than an enterpriſing diſpoſition, always purſuing the common road, and ſcarcely ever acting without the aid of his council. Inſtead of taking upon himſelf the ſole determination of judicial controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, after the example of his predeceſſor, he called to his aſſiſtance a few juſtices of the peace. This, which was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the court of aſſizes<note n="*" place="bottom">This was a court both of law and equity, for the trial of cauſes of 20<abbr>l.</abbr> and upwards, and ordinarily ſat but once a year. Subordinate to this, were the town courts and ſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; the former took cognizance of actions under 5<abbr>l.</abbr> and the latter, of ſuits between that ſum and twenty pounds: ſeven conſtables and overſeers were judges in the firſt; and in the laſt, the juſtices of the peace, with a jury of ſeven men. The verdict of the majority was ſufficient.</note>, was the principal law judicatory in thoſe times. The legiſlative power under the duke, was veſted entirely in the governor and council. A third eſtate might then be eaſily diſpenſed with, for the charge of the

Nicolls on the firſt of June 1665, and was thus. The high ſheriff iſſued a warrant annually, to the high conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of every diſtrict, and they ſent theirs to the petty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables; who, with the overſeers of each town, made a liſt of all male perſons above ſixteen years of age, with an eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of their rent and perſonal eſtates, and then taxed them according to certain rates, preſcribed by a law. After the aſſeſſment was returned to the high ſheriff, and approved by the governor, the conſtables received warrants for levying the taxes by diſtreſs and ſale.</note>, and in a great meaſure defrayed by his royal highneſs, the proprietor of the country.</p>
            <p>Upon concluſion of the peace in 1674, the duke of York, to remove all controverſy reſpecting his property, obtained a new patent<note n="*" place="bottom">Some are of opinion, that the ſecond patent was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary, the duke being reveſted per poſt liminium. This matter has been often diſputed, in the ejectments between the New-Jerſey proprietors and the Elizabethtown paten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees. In New York, the right of poſt liminy was diſregarded, and perhaps unknown: for there are many inſtances, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially on Long Iſland, of new grants from ſir Edmond Androſs, for lands patented under Nicolls and Lovelace, by which the quit-rents have been artfully enlarged.</note> from the king, dated the 29th of June, for the lands granted in 1664, and two days after commiſſioned major, afterwards ſir Edmond Androſs to be governor of his territories in America. After the reſignation of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, which was made to him by the Dutch poſſeſſors, on the 31ſt of October following, he called a court martial, to try Manning for his treacherous and cowardly ſurrender. The articles of accuſation exhibited againſt him, were in ſubſtance,</p>
            <p n="1">I. That the ſaid Manning, on the 28th of July, 1673, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing notice of the approach of the enemy's fleet, did not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to put the garriſon in a poſture of defence; but, on the contrary, ſlighted ſuch as offered their aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That while the fleet was at anchor under Staten Iſland, on the 30th of July, he treacherouſly ſent on board to treat with the enemy, to the great diſcouragement of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That he ſuffered the fleet to moor under the fort, forbidding a gen to be fired, on pain of death.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="45" facs="unknown:024800_0041_0FCD62AD94BF1C88"/>
IV. That he permitted the enemy to land, without the leaſt oppoſition.</p>
            <p n="5">V. That, ſhortly after he had ſent perſons to treat with the Dutch commodores, he ſtruck his flag, even before the enemy were in ſight of the garriſon, the fort being in a condition, and the men deſirous, to fight.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. And laſtly, that he treacherouſly cauſed the fort gates to be opened, and cowardly and baſely let in the enemy, yielding the garriſon without articles.</p>
            <p>This ſcandalous charge, which Manning on his trial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to be true, is leſs ſurpriſing, than the lenity of the ſentence pronounced againſt him. It was this, that though he deſerved death, yet becauſe he had, ſince the ſurrender, been in England, and ſeen the king and the duke, it was adjudge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that his ſword ſhould be broke over his head in public, before the city hall, and himſelf rendered incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of wearing a ſword, and of ſerving his majeſty for the future, in any public truſt in the government.</p>
            <p>This light cenſure is however no proof, that ſir Edmond was a man of a merciful diſpoſition; the hiſtorians of New-England, where he was afterwards governor, juſtly tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to poſterity, under the odious character of a ſyco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantic <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            <p>In the year 1675, Nicholas Renſlaer, a Dutch clergyman, arrived here. He claimed the manor of Renſlaerwick, and was recommended by the duke to ſir Edmond Androſs for a living in one of the churches at New-York, or Albany, probably to ſerve the popiſh cauſe<note n="*" place="bottom">Another reaſon is aſſigned for the favour he met with from the crown. It is ſaid, that while Charles II. was an exile, he predicted the day of his reſtoration. The people of Albany had a high opinion of his prophetic ſpirit, and many ſtrange tales about him ſtill prevail there. The parſon made nothing of his claim, the manor being afterwards granted, by col. Dongan, to Killian Van Renſlaer, a diſtant relation. This extenſive tract, by the Dutch called a colony, is an oblong, extending 24 miles upon Hudſon's river, and as many on each ſide. The patent of confirmation was iſſued by ſpecial direction from the king, and is the moſt liberal, in the privileges it grants, of any one in the province.</note>. Niewenhyt, miniſter
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:024800_0042_0FCD62AE90DE63D0"/>of the church at Albany, diſputed his right to adminiſter the ſacraments; becauſe he had received an epiſcopal or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, and was not app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oved by the claſſis of Amſterdam, to which the Dutch churches here hold themſelves ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. In this controverſy, the governor took the part of Renilaer, and accordingly ſummoned Niewenhyt before him, to anſwer for his conduct. This miniſter was treated wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h ſuch ſingular contempt, and ſo frequently harraſſed by fruitleſs and expenſive attendances before the council, that the diſpute became intereſting, and the greater part of the people reſented the uſage he met with. Hence we find, that the magiſtrates of Albany, ſoon after impriſoned Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaer, for ſeveral dubious words (as they are called in the record) delivered in a ſermon. The governor, on the other hand, ordered him to be releaſed, and ſummoned the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates to attend him at New York. Warrants were then iſſued to compel them to give ſecurity in 5000<abbr>l.</abbr> each, to make out good cauſe for confining the miniſter. Leiſler, who was one of them, refuſed to comply with the warrant, and was thrown into gaol. Sir Edmond, fearful that a great party would riſe up againſt him, was at laſt compelled to diſcontinue his eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction, and to refer the controverſy to the determination of the conſiſtory of the Dutch church at Albany. It is perhaps not improbable, that theſe popiſh meaſures ſowed the ſeeds of that averſion to the duke's government, which afterwards produced thoſe violent convulſions in the province under Leiſler, at the time of the revolution, in favour of the prince of Orange.</p>
            <p>If ſir Edmond Androſs's adminiſtration at New-York, appears to be leſs exceptionable, than while he commanded at Boſton, it was through want of more opportunities to ſhow himſelf in his true light. The main courſe of his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic proceedings, during his continuance in the province, was ſpent in the ordinary acts of government, which then principally conſiſted in paſſing grants to the ſubject, and preſiding in the court of aſſize, eſtabliſhed by col. Lovelace. The public exigencies were now in part ſupplied by a kind of benevolence; the badge of bad times! This appears in an entry on the records, of a letter of May the 5th, 1676, from governor And<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Before I proceed to the ſucceeding adminiſtration, in which our Indian affairs began to have a powerful influence upon the public meaſures, it may not be improper to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the reader with a ſummary view of the hiſtory and character of the five nations<note n="*" place="bottom">By the Dutch called Maquaas, by the French Iroquois, and by us, five nations, ſix nations, and lately the confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates. They are greatly diminiſhed, and conſiſt now only of about twelve hundred ſighting men.</note>. Theſe, of all thoſe innumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able tribes of ſavages, which inhabit the northern part of America, are of moſt importance to us and the French, both on account of their vicinity and warlike diſpoſition. Before the late incorporation of the Tuſcaroras, a people driven by the inhabitants of Carolina from the frontiers of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, they conſiſted of five confederate cantons<note n="†" place="bottom">The Tuſcaroras were received upon a ſuppoſition, that they were originally of the ſame ſtock with the five nations, becauſe there is ſome ſimilitude between their languages.</note>. What in particular gave riſe to this league, and when it took place, are queſtions which neither the natives, nor Europeans, pretend to anſwer. Each of theſe nations is divided into three families, or clans, of different ranks, bearing for their arms, and being diſtinguiſhed by the names of, the tortoiſe, the bear, and the wolf<note n="‡" place="bottom">Their inſtruments of conveyances are ſigned by ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which they make with a pen, repreſenting theſe animals.</note>.</p>
            <p>No people in the world, perhaps, have higher notions than theſe Indians, of military glory. All the ſurrounding nations have felt the effects of their proweſs; and many not only became their tributaries, but were ſo ſubjugated to their power, that without their conſent, they durſt not commence either peace or war.</p>
            <p>Though a regular police for the preſervation of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony within, and the defence of the ſtate againſt invaſions from without, is not to be expected from the people of whom I am now writing, yet perhaps, they have paid more attention to it than is generally allowed. Their government is ſuited to their condition. A people whoſe riches conſiſt

All their affairs, whether reſpecting peace or war, are under the direction of their ſachems, or chief men. Great exploits and public virtue procure the eſteem of a people, and qualify a man to adviſe in council, and execute the plan concerted for the advantage of his country: thus whoever appears to the Indians in this advantageous light, commences a ſachem without any o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>As there is no other way of arriving at this dignity, ſo it ceaſes, unleſs an uniform zeal and activity for the common good, is uninterruptedly continued. Some have thought it hereditary; but that is a miſtake. The ſon is, indeed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected for his father's ſervices; but, without perſonal me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, he can never ſhare in the government; which, were it otherwiſe, muſt ſink into perfect diſgrace.

            <p>Each of theſe republics has its own particular chiefs, who hear and determine all complaints in council; and, though they have no officers for the execution of juſtice, yet their decree<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The five nations can never be enſlaved, till they grow rich by agriculture and commerce. Property is the moſt permanent baſis of power.

All affairs, which concern the general intereſt, are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in a great aſſembly of the chiefs of each canton, uſually held at Onondaga, the centre of their country. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on emergencies, they act ſeparately; but nothing can bind the league, but the voice of the general convention.</p>
            <p>The French, upon the maxim, <hi>divide et impera,</hi> have tried all poſſible means to divide theſe republics, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times have even ſown great jealouſies among them. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this plan, they have ſeduced many families to withdraw to Canada, and there ſettled them in regular towns, under the command of a fort, and the tuition of miſſionaries.</p>
            <p>The manners of theſe ſavages are as ſimple as their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Their houſes are a few crotched ſtakes thruſt into the ground, and overlaid with bark. A fire is kindled in the middle, and an aperture left at the top for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of the ſmoke. Whenever a conſiderable number of thoſe huts are collected, they have a caſtle, as it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, conſiſting of a ſquare without baſtions, ſurrounded with palliſadoes. They have no other fortification: and this is only deſigned as an aſylum for their old men, their wives, and children, while the reſt are gone out to war. They live almoſt entirely without care. While the women, or ſquaws, cultivate a little ſpot of ground for corn, the men employ themſelves in hunting. As to clothes, they uſe a blanket girt at the waiſt, and thrown looſely over their ſhoulders; ſom of their women, indeed. have beſides this, a ſort of a petticoat, and a few of their men wear ſhirts; but the greater part of them are generally half naked. In winter, their legs are covered with ſtockings of blanket, and their feet with ſocks of deer ſkin. Many of them are fond to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, and their taſte is very ſingular. I have ſeen rings affixed, not only to their ears, but their noſes. Bracelets of ſilver and braſs round their wriſts, are very common. The women plait their hair, and tie it up behind in a bag, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in imitation of the French beaux in Canada. Though the Indians are capable of ſuſtaining great hardſhips, yet they cannot endure much labour, being rather fleet, than ſtrong. Their men are taller than the Europeans, rarely
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:024800_0046_0FCD62B9128A0C48"/>corpulent, always beardleſs,<note n="*" place="margin">Becauſe they pluck out the hairs.

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. In their food, they have no manner of delivery; for though veniſon is their ordinary diet, yet ſometimes they eat dogs, bears, and even ſnakes. Their cookery is of two kinds, boiled or roaſted; to perform the latter, the meat is penetrated by a ſhort ſharp ſtick ſet in the ground, inclining towards the fire, and turned as occaſion requires. They are hoſpitable to ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; though few Europeans would reliſh their higheſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of this kind; for they are very naſty both in their governments and food. Every man has his own wiſe, whom he takes and leaves at pleaſure: a plurality, however, at the ſome time, is by no means admitted among them. They have been generally commended for their chaſtity; but I am informed by good authority. that they are very laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civious, and that the women, to avoid reproach, frequently deſtroy the foetus in the womb. They are ſo perfectly free, that unleſs their children, who generally aſſiſt the mother, may be called ſervants, they have none. The men frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſociate themſelves for converſation, by which means they not only preſerve the remembrance of their wars, and treaties, but diffuſe among their youths, incitements to military glory, as well as inſtruction in all the ſubtilties of war.</p>
            <p>Since they became acquainted with the Europeans, their warlike apparatus is a muſket, hatcher<note n="†" place="margin">Hence, to take up the hatcher, is with them a phraſe ſignifying to declare war; as, on the contrary, to bury it denotes the eſtabliſhment of a peace.</note>, and a long knife. Their boys ſtill accuſtom themſelves to bows and arrows, and are ſo dextrous in the uſe of them, that a lad of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, will ſtrike an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Engliſh ſhilling five times in ten, at twelve or fourteen yards diſtance. Their men are excellent markſmen, both with the gun and hatcher; their dexterity at the latter is very extraordinary; for they rarely miſs the object, though at a conſiderable diſtance. The hatcher in the flight perpetually turns round, and yet always ſtrikes the mark with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dge.</p>
            <p>Before they go out, they have a feaſt upon dogs' fleſh, and a great war dance. At theſe, the warriors, who are frightfully painted with vermillion, riſe up, and ſing their
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:024800_0047_0FCD62BB24BA4478"/>own exploits, or thoſe of their anceſtors, and thereby kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle a military enthuſiaſm in the whole company. The day after the dance, they march out a few miles in a row, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving a profound ſilence. The proceſſion being ended, they ſtrip the bark from a large oak, and paint the deſign of their expedition on the naked trunk. The figure of a canoe, with the number of men in it, determines the ſtrength of their party; and by a deer, a fox, or ſome other emblem painted at the head of it, we diſcover againſt what nation they are gone out.</p>
            <p>The five nations being devoted to war, every art is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to diffuſe a military ſpirit through the whole body of their people. The ceremonies attending the return of a party, ſeem calculated in particular for that purpoſe. The day before they enter the village, two heralds advance, and, at a ſmall diſtance, ſet up a yell, which, by its modula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, intimates either good or bad news. If the former, the village is alarmed, and an entertainment provided for the conquerors, who, in the mean time, approach in ſight: one of them bears the ſcalps ſtretched over a bow, and elevated upon a long pole. The boldeſt man in the town comes out, and receives it, and inſtantly flies to the hut where the reſt are collected. If he is overtaken, he is beaten unmercifully: but if he out-runs the purſuer, he participates in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the victors, who, at their firſt entrance, receive no compliments, nor ſpeak a ſingle word till the end of the feaſt. Their parents, wives, and children, then are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and treat them with the profoundeſt reſpect. After theſe ſalutations, one of the conquerors is appointed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the whole adventure, to which the reſt attentively liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, without aſking a queſtion, and the whole concludes with a ſavage dance.</p>
            <p>The Indians never fight in the field, or upon equal terms; but always ſculk and attack, by ſurpriſe, in ſmall parties, meeting every night at a place of rendezvous. Scarcely any enemy can eſcape them; for by the diſpoſition of the graſs and leaves, they follow his track with great ſpeed any where but over a rock. Their barbarity is ſhocking to human nature. Women and children they generally kill and ſcalp, becauſe they would retard their progreſs; but the men they carry into captivity. If any woman has loſt a relation, and inclines to receive the priſoner in his ſtead, he not only eſcapes a ſeries of the moſt inhuman tortures, and death itſelf, but enjoys every immunity they can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow, and is eſteemed a member of the family into which he is adopted. To part with him would be the moſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:024800_0048_0FCD62BC18580A58"/>conduct, and conſidered as ſelling the blood of the deceaſed; and for this reaſon it is not without the greateſt difficulty, that a captive is redeemed.</p>
            <p>When the Indians incline to peace, a meſſenger is ſent to the enemy with a pipe, the bowl of which is made of ſoft, red marble; and a long reed beautifully painted, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with the gay plumage of birds, forms the ſtem. This is his infallible protection from any aſſault on the way. The envoy makes his propoſals to the enemy, who, if they approve them, ratify the preliminaries to the peace, by ſmoking through the pipe, and from that inſtant a general ceſſation of arms takes place. The French call it a calume<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. It is uſed, as far as I can learn, by all the Indian nations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the continent. The rights of it are eſteemed ſacred, and have been only invaded by the flat heads; in juſt indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for which, the confederates maintained a war with them for near thirty years.</p>
            <p>As to the language of the five nations, the beſt account I have had of it, is contained in a letter from the reverend mr. Spencer, who reſided among them in the year 1748, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then a miſſionary from the Scotch ſociety for propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting chriſtian knowledge. He writes thus:</p>

                  <p>Except the Tuſcaroras, all the ſix nations ſpeak a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage radically the ſame. It is very maſculine and ſonorous, abounding with gutturals and ſtrong aſpirations, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out labials. Its ſolemn grave tone is owing to the generoſity of its feet, as you will obſerve in the following tranſlation of the Lord's prayer, in which I have diſtinguiſhed the time of every ſyllable by the common marks uſed in proſody<note n="*" place="bottom">If we had a good dictionary marking the quantity as well as emphaſis of every ſyllable in the Engliſh language, it would conduce to an accuracy and uniformity of pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation. The dignity of ſtyle, ſo far as the ear is concerned, conſiſts principally in generous feet; and perhaps it may be a juſt remark, that no ſentence, unleſs in a dialogue, ends well without a full ſound. Gordon and Fordyce rarely ſwerve from this rule: and mr. Maſon, an ingenious author, has lately written with great applauſe on this attribute of ſtyle.</note>.</p>

Their ſpeeches are ſhort, and the ſenſe conveyed in ſtrong meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors.

With reſpect to religion, the Indians may be ſaid to be under the thickeſt gloom of ignorance. If they have any, which is much to be queſtioned, thoſe who affirm it, will find it difficult to tell us wherein it conſiſts. They have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prieſt, nor temple, ſacrifice nor altar. Some traces, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, appear, of the original law written upon their hearts; but they have no ſyſtem of doctrines, nor any rites and modes of public worſhip. They are ſunk, unſpeakably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the polite pagans of antiquity. Some confuſed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, indeed, of beings ſuperior to themſelves, they have, but of the Deity and his natural and moral perfections, no proper or tolerable conceptions; and of his general and particular providence they know nothing. They profeſs no obligations to him, nor acknowledge their dependence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. Some of them, it is ſaid, are of opinion, that there are two diſtinct, powerful beings, one able to help, the other to do them harm. The latter they venerate moſt, and ſome allege that they addreſs him by a kind of prayer. Though there are no public monuments of idolatry to be ſeen in their country, yet the miſſionaries have diſcovered coarſe imagery in wooden trinkets, in the hands of their jugglers, which the converts deliver up as deteſtable. The ſight of them, would remind a man of letters, of the lares and penates of the ancients; but no certain judgment can be drawn of their uſe. The Indians ſometimes aſſemble in large numbers, and retire far into the wilderneſs, where they eat and drink in a profuſe manner. Theſe conventions are called Kenticoys. Some eſteem them to be debauched revels or Bacchanalia: but thoſe who have privately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them into theſe receſſes, give ſuch accounts of their conduct, as naturally lead one to imagine, that they pay a Joint homage and ſupplication to ſome inviſible being. If we ſuppoſe they have a religion, it is worſe than none, and raiſes in the generous mind, moſt melancholy ideas of their depraved condition. Little has been done to illuminate theſe dark corners of the earth, with the light of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. The French prieſts boaſt, indeed, of their converts, but they have made more proſelytes to polities than reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Queen Anne ſent a miſſionary among them, and gave him an appointment out of the privy purſe. He was a man
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:024800_0051_0FCD62C455233588"/>of a good life, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ot ſlow parts, and his ſucceſs very inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable. The reverend mr. Barclay afterwards reſided among the Mohawks; but no ſuitable proviſion being made for an interpreter, he was obliged to break up the miſſion. If the Engliſh ſociety for propagating the goſpel, that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly venerable body, inſtead of maintaining miſſionaries in rich chriſtian congregations along the continent, expended half the amount of their annual contributions on the evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts among the heathen, beſides the unſpeakable reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious benefits that would, it is to be hoped, accrue to the natives, ſuch a proceeding would conduce greatly to the ſafety of our colonies, and his majeſty's ſervice. Much has been written upon this ſubject in America<note n="*" place="bottom">See mr. Hobart's letters to the epiſcopalians in New-England: the account of the Scotch miſſion at Stockbridge: Douglaſs's ſummary, &amp;c.</note>; and why no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to purpoſe has yet been attempted in England, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſo laudable a deſign, can only be attributed to the amazing falſehoods and miſrepreſentations, by which ſome of the miſſionaries have long impoſed upon benevolent: minds in Great Britain<note n="†" place="bottom">This is notorious to all who give themſelves the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of peruſing the abſtracts of their accounts publiſhed in England. It would be 2 very agreeable office to me, on this occaſion, to diſtinguiſh the innocent from the guilty, but that ſuch a taſk would infallibly raiſe up a hoſt of enemies. Many of the miſſionaries are men of learning and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary morals. Theſe in America are known and honoured, and cannot be prejudiced by an indiſcriminate cenſure. Their joining in a repreſentation for diſtinguiſhing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents, who are a diſgrace to the cloth, will ſerve as a full vindication of themſelves to the ſociety. Mr. Ogilvie is, I believe, the only perſon now employed by that charitable corporation among the Indians, and the greateſt part even of his charge is in the city of Albany. All the Scotch miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries are among the heathen, and their ſucceſs has been ſufficient to encourage any future attempts. There is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular ſociety of Indian converts in New Jerſey; and it is worthy of remark, that not one of them has apoſtatized into heatheniſm. Some of them have made ſuch proficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in practical religion, as ought to ſhame many of us, who boaſt the illuminating aids of our native chriſtianity. Not one of theſe Indians has been concerned in thoſe bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous irruptions, which have lately deluged the frontiers of the ſouth-weſtern provinces, with the blood of ſeveral hundred innocents of every age and ſex. At the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of theſe ravages, they flew into the ſettlements, and put themſelves under the protection of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Theſe Indians no ſooner became chriſtians, than they openly profeſſed their loyalty to king George; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to contribute to their converſion, was as truly politic, as nobly chriſtian. Thoſe colonies which have done moſt for this charitable deſign, have eſcaped beſt from the late diſtreſſing calamities. Of all the miſſionaries, mr. David Brainerd, who recovered theſe Indians from the darkneſs of paganiſm, was moſt ſucceſsful. He died the 9th of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1747, a victim to his extreme mortification and inextin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable zeal, for the proſperity of his miſſion. Thoſe who are curious to enquire particularly into the effects of his indefatigable induſtry, may have recourſe to his journal, publiſhed at Philadelphia, by the American correſpondents of the Scotch ſociety, in whoſe ſervice he was employed. Dr. Doughlaſs, ever ready to do honour to his native coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, after remarking that this ſelf-denying clergyman rode about 400 miles, in the year 1744, with an air of approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, aſks, "Is there any miſſionary, from any of the ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties, for propagating the goſpel in foreign parts, that has reported the like?"</note>.</p>

As to the hiſtory of the five nations, before their acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the Europeans, it is wrapt up in the darkneſs of antiquity. It is ſaid that their firſt reſidence was in the country about Montreal; and that the ſuperior ſtrength of the Adirondacs, whom the French call Algonquins, drove them into their preſent poſſeſſions, lying on the ſouth ſide of the Mohawks river, and the great lake Ontario<note n="*" place="bottom">Charlevoix, in partiality to the French, limits the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the five nations, on the north, to the 44th degree of latitude; according to which, all the country on the north ſide of the lake Ontario, and the river iſſuing thence to Montreal, together with a conſiderable tract of land on the ſouth ſide of that river, belongs to the French. Hennepin, a recollect friar, has more regard to truth than the jeſuit; for he tells us in effect, that the Iroquois poſſeſſed the lands on the north, as well as the ſouth ſide of the lake, and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſeveral of their villages in 1679, viz. Tejajahon, Kente, and Ganneouſſe. The map in his book agrees with the text. Charlevoix is at variance with his geographer; for mr. Bellin, beſides laying down theſe towns in the map, contained in the fifth volume, writes on the north ſide of the protraction of lake Ontario, <hi>les Iroquois du nord.</hi>

               </gap>brage at their ſucceſs, and began a war with them, which had well nigh ruined the new colony. In autumn 1665, m. Courcelles, the governor, ſent, out a party againſt the Mohawks. Through ignorance of the country, and the want of ſnow-ſhoes, they were almoſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, when they fell in with Schenectady. And even there the Indians would have ſacrificed them to their barbarous rage, had not Corlear, a Dutchman, interpoſed to protect them. For this ſeaſonable hoſpitality, the French governor invited him to Canada, but he was unfortunately drowned in his paſſage through the lake Champlain. It is in honour of this man, who was a favourite of the Indians, that the governors of New York, in all their treaties, are addreſſed by the name of Corlear. Twenty light companies of foot, and the whole militia of Canada, marched the next ſpring into the country of the Mohawks: but their ſucceſs was vaſtly unequal to the charge and labour of ſuch a tedious march of 700 miles through an uncultivated deſart; for the Indians, on their approach, retired into the woods, leaving behind them ſome old ſachems, who preferred death to life, to glut the fury of their enemies. The emptineſs of this parade on the one hand, and the Indian fearfulneſs of fire arms on the other, brought about a peace in 1667, which continued for ſeveral years after. In this interval, both the Engliſh and French cultivated a trade with the natives, very profitable to both nations. The latter, however, were moſt politic and vigorous, and filled the Indian country with their miſſionaries. The ſieur Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ot, the very year in which the peace was concluded, travelled about 1200 miles weſt-ward, making proſelytes of the Indians every where to the French intereſt. Courcelles appears to have been a man of art and induſtry. He took every meaſure in his power for the defence of Canada. To prevent the irruptions of the five nations, by the way of lake Champlain, he built ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral forts in 1665, between that and the mouth of the river Sorel.

            <p>Though the duke of York had preferred col.

            <p>The people, who had been formerly ruled at the will of the duke's deputies, began their firſt participation in the legiſlative power under col. Dongan; for ſhortly after his arrival, he iſſued orders to the ſheriffs, to ſummon the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders for chooſing repreſentatives, to meet him in aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly on the 17th of October, 1683. Nothing could be more agreeable to the people, who, whether Dutch or Engliſh, were born the ſubjects of a free ſtate; nor, indeed, was the change of leſs advantage to the duke, than to the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants. For ſuch a general diſguſt had prevailed, and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in Long Iſland, againſt the old form which col. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colls had introduced, as threatened the total ſubverſion of the public tranquillity. Col. Dongan ſaw the diſaffection of the people at the eaſt end of the iſland, for he landed there on his firſt arrival in the country; and to extinguiſh the fire of diſcontent, then impatient to burſt out, gave them his promiſe, that no laws or rates for the future ſhould be impoſed, but by a general aſſembly.

It would have been impoſſible for him much longer to have maintained the old model over free ſubjects, who had juſt before formed themſelves into a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony for the enjoyment of their liberties, and had even al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſolicited the protection of the colony of Connecticut, from whence the greateſt part of them came. Diſputes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the limits of certain townſhips at the eaſt end of Long Iſland, ſowed the ſeeds of enmity againſt Dongan, ſo deeply in the hearts of many who were concerned in them, that their repreſentation to Connecticut, at the revolution, contains the bittereſt invectives againſt him.</p>
            <p>Dongan ſurpaſſed all his predeceſſors, in a due attention to our affairs with the Indians, by whom he was highly eſteemed. It muſt be remembered to his honour, that though he was ordered by the duke, to encourage the French prieſts, who were come to reſide among the natives, under pretence of advancing the popiſh cauſe, but in reality to gain them over to the French intereſt; yet he forbid the five nations to entertain them. The jeſuits, however, had no ſmall ſucceſs. Their proſelytes are called praying Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, or Caghnuagaes, and reſide now in Canada, at the fall of St. Lewis, oppoſite to Montreal. This village was begun in 1671, and conſiſts of ſuch of the five nations, as have formerly been drawn away by the intrigues of the French prieſts, in the times of Lovelace and Androſs, who ſeem to have paid no attention to our Indian affairs<note n="*" place="bottom">Of late, ſome others of the confederates have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured to ſettle at Oſwegatchi, called by the French, la Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lette, near 50 miles below Frontenac. General Shirley's emiſſaries from Oſwego, in 1755, prevailed with ſeveral of theſe families to return to their old habitations.</note>. It was owing to the inſtigation alſo of theſe prieſts, that the five nations about this time, committed hoſtilities on the back parts of Maryland and Virginia, which occaſioned a grand conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at Albany, in the year 1684. Lord Howard of Effing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, the governor of Virginia, was preſent, and made a covenant with them for preventing further depredations, towards the accompliſhment of which, col.

Doctor Colden has publiſhed this treaty at large: but as it has no immediate connexion with the affairs of this province, I beg leave to refer the reader for a full account of it, to his hiſtory of the five nations.</p>
            <p>While lord Howard was at Albany, a meſſenger from de la Barre, then governor of Canada, arrived there, complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Seneca Indians, for interrupting the French in their trade with the more diſtant Indians, commonly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded among us by the general name of the far nations<note n="‡" place="bottom">By the far nations are meant, all thoſe numerous tribes inhabiting the countries on both ſides of the lakes Huron and Erie, weſtward as far as the Miſſiſſippi, and the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern country along the banks of the Ohio, and its branches.</note>. Colonel Dongan, to whom the meſſage was ſent, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated it to the Senecas, who admitted the charge, but juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied their conduct, alleging, that the French ſupplied arms and ammunition to the Twightwies<note n="*" place="bottom">By the French called Miamies.</note>, with whom they were then at war. De la Barre, at the ſame time, medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting nothing leſs than the total deſtruction of the five na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, proceeded with an army of 1700 men to the lake Ontario. Mighty preparations were made to obtain the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired ſucceſs: freſh troops were imported from France, and a letter procured from the duke of York to col. Dongan, commanding him to lay no obſtacles in the way. The offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers poſted in the out forts, even as far as Meſſiſimakinac, were ordered to rendezvous at Niagara, with all the weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern Indians they could engage. Dongan, regardleſs of the duke's orders, appriſed the Indians of the French deſigns, and promiſed to aſſiſt them. After ſix weeks delay at fort Frontenac, during which time a great ſickneſs, occaſioned by bad proviſions, broke out in the French army, de la Barre found it neceſſary to conclude the campaign with a treaty, for which purpoſe he croſſed the lake, and came to the place, which, from the diſtreſs of his army, was called la Famine. Dongan ſent an interpreter among the Indians, by all means to prevent them from attending the treaty. The Mohawks and Senecas accordingly refuſed to meet de la Barre: but the Oneydoes, Onondagas, and Cayugas, influenced by the miſſionaries, were unwilling to hear the interpreter, except before the prieſts, one la Main, and three other Frenchmen, and afterwards waited upon the

            <p>"The king, my maſter, being informed, that the five na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have often infringed the peace, has ordered me to come hither with a guard, and to ſend Ohgueſſe to the Onondagas, to bring the chief ſachems to my camp. The intention of the great king is, that you and I may ſmoke the calumet of peace together; but on this condition, that you promiſe me, in the name of the Senecas, Cayugas, Onondagas, and Mohawks, to give entire ſatisfaction and reparation to his ſubjects, and for the future, never to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt them.</p>
            <p>"The Senecas, Cayugas, Onondagas, Oneydoes, and Mohawks, have robbed and abuſed all the traders that were paſſing to the Illinois and Miamies, and other Indian nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the children of my king. They have acted, on theſe occaſions, contrary to the treaty of peace with my prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor. I am ordered, therefore, to demand ſatisfaction, and to tell them, that in caſe of refuſal, or their plundering us any more, I have expreſs orders to declare war. This belt confirms my words. The warriors of the five nations have conducted the Engliſh into the lakes, which belong to the king, my maſter, and brought the Engliſh among the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are his children, to deſtroy the trade of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and to withdraw theſe nations from him. They have carried the Engliſh thither, notwithſtanding the prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the late governor of New York, who foreſaw the riſque that both they and you would run. I am willing to forget thoſe things, but if ever the like ſhall happen for the future, I have expreſs orders to declare war againſt you. This belt confirms my words. Your warriors have made ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral barbarous incurſions on the Illinois and Umameis; they have maſſacred men, women, and children, and have made many of theſe nations priſoners, who thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſafe in their villages in time of peace: theſe people, who are my king's children, muſt not be your ſlaves; you muſt give them their liberty, and ſend them back into their own country. If the five nations ſhall refuſe to do this, I have expreſs orders to declare war againſt them. This belt confirms my words.</p>
            <p>"This is what I have to ſay to Garrangula, that he may carry to the Senecas, Onondagas, Oneydoes, Cayugas, and Mohawks, the declaration which the king, my maſter, has
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:024800_0058_0FCD62D1CDDDD9B8"/>commanded me to make. He doth not wiſh them to force him to fend a great army to Cadarackui fort, to begin a war, which muſt be fatal to them. He would be ſorry that this fort, that was the work of peace, ſhould become the priſon of your warriors. We muſt endeavour, on both ſides, to prevent ſuch misfortunes. The French, who are the brethren and friends of the five nations, will never trouble their repoſe, provided that the ſatisfaction which I demand, be given, and that the treaties of peace be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after obſerved. I ſhall be extremely grieved, if my words do not produce the effect, which I expect from them; for then I ſhall be obliged to join with the governor of New-York, who is commanded by his maſter, to aſſiſt me, and burn the caſtles of the five nations, and deſtroy you.

Yes, Yonnondio, ſurely you muſt have dreamt ſo; and the curioſity of ſeeing ſo great a wonder, has brought you ſo far. Now you are undeceived, ſince that I and the warriors here preſent, are come to aſſure you, that the Senecas, Cayugas, Onondagas, Oneydoes, and Mohawks, are yet alive.

                        <p>I ſee Yonnondio raving in a camp of ſick men, whoſe lives the great ſpirit has ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap>d, by inflicting this ſickneſs on them. Hear, Yonnondio, our women had taken their clubs, our children and old men had carried their bows and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows into the heart of your camp, if our warriors had not diſarmed them, and kept them back, when your meſſenger, Ohgueſſe, came to our caſtles. It is done, and I have ſaid it. Hear, Yonnondio, we plundered none of the French, but thoſe that carried guns, powder, and ball to the Twight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wies and Chictaghics, becauſe thoſe arms might have coſt us our lives. Herein we follow the example of the jeſuits, who ſtave all the kegs of rum brought to our caſtles, leſt the drunken Indians ſhould knock them on the head. Our war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors have not bever enough to pay for all theſe arms, that they have taken, and our old men are not afraid of the war. This belt preſerves my words.</p>
                        <p>We carried the Engliſh into our lakes, to trade there with the Utawawas and Quatoghies, as the Adirondacks brought the French to our caſtles, to carry on a trade, which the Engliſh ſay is theirs. We are born free; we neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on Yonnondio or Corlear.</p>
                        <p>We may go where we pleaſe, and carry with us whom we pleaſe, and buy and ſell what we pleaſe: if your allies be your ſlaves, uſe them as ſuch; command them to receive no other but your people. This belt preſerves my words.</p>
                        <p>We knocked the Twightwies and Chictaghics on the head, becauſe they had cut down the trees of peace, which were the limits of our country. They have hunted bevers on our lands: they have acted contrary to the cuſtoms of all Indians; for they left none of the bevers alive, they kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led both male and female. They brought the Satanas<note n="*" place="bottom">By the French called Sauounons.</note> into the country, to take part with them, after they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed ill deſigns againſt us. We have done leſs than either the Engliſh or French, that have uſurped the lands of ſo many Indian nations, and chaſed them from their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. This belt preſerves my words.</p>
                        <p>Hear, Yonnondio; what I ſay, is the voice of all the five nations; hear what they anſwer; open your ears to what they ſpeak. The Senecas, Cayugas, Onondagas, Oneydoes, and Mohawks ſay, that when they buried the

            <p>Then Garrangula, addreſſing himſelf to monſieur la Main, ſaid, "Take courage, Ohgueſſe, you have ſpirit, ſpeak, explain my words, forget nothing, tell all that your brethren and friends ſay to Yonnondio, your governor, by the mouth of Garrangula, who loves you, and deſires you to accept of this preſent of bever, and take part with me in my feaſt, to which I invite you. This preſent of bever is ſent to Yonnondio, on the part of the five nations."</p>
            <p>Enraged at this bold reply, de la Barre, as ſoon as the peace was concluded, retired to Montreal, and ingloriouſly finiſhed an expenſive campaign, as dr. Colden obſerves, in a ſcold with an old Indian.</p>
            <p>De la Barre was ſucceeded by the marquis de Nonville, colonel of the dragoons, who arrived with a reinforcement of troops in 1685. The marquis was a man of courage and an enterpriſing ſpirit, and not a little animated by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, that he was ſent over to repair the diſgrace, which his predeceſſor had brought upon the French colony. The year after his arrival at Quebec, he wrote a letter to the miniſter in France, recommending the ſcheme of erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſtone fort, ſufficient to contain four or five hundred men, at Niagara, not only to exclude the Engliſh from the lakes, but to command the fur trade and ſubdue the five na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Dongan, who was jealous of his deſigns, took um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage at the extraordinary ſupplies ſent to fort Frontenac, and wrote to the French governors, ſignifying, that if he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked the confederates, he would conſider it, as a breach
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:024800_0061_0FCD62D88D8AEF28"/>of the peace ſubſiſting between the two crowns; and to prevent his building a fort at Niagara, he proteſted againſt it, and claimed the country as dependent upon the province. De Nonville, in his anſwer, denied that he intended to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the Five Nations, tho' the neceſſary preparations for that purpoſe were then carrying on; and yet Charlevoix commends him for his piety and uprightneſs, "<hi>egalement eſtimable</hi> (ſays the jeſuit) <hi>pour ſa valour, ſa droiture, &amp; ſo pieté.</hi>" Colonel Dongan, who knew the importance of our Indian alliance, placed no confidence in the declarations of the marquis, but exerted himſelf in preparing the confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates for a war; and the French author, juſt mentioned, does him honour, while he complains of him as a perpetual obſtacle, in the way of the execution of their ſchemes. Our allies were now triumphing in their ſucceſs over the Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taghics, and meditating a war with the Twightwies, who had diſturbed them in their bever-hunting. De Nonville, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the interruption of the French trade with the Twight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wies, determined to divert the Five Nations, and carry the war into their country. To that end, in 1687, he collected 2000 troops and 600 Indians at Montreal, and iſſued orders to all the officers in the more weſterly country, to meet him with additional ſuccours at Niagara, on an expedition againſt the Senecas. An Engliſh party, under one M'Gregory, at the ſame time was gone out to trade on the lakes, but the French, notwithſtanding the peace then ſubſiſting between the two crowns, intercepted them, ſeized their effects, and impriſoned their perſons. Monſieur Fonti, commandant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Chictaghics, who was coming to the general's ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous at Niagara, did the like to another Engliſh party, which he met with in lake Erie.<note n="*" place="bottom">Both theſe attacks were open infractions of the treaty at Whitehall, executed in Nov. 1686; by which it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, that the Indian trade in America, ſhould be free to the Engliſh and French.</note> The Five Nations, in the mean time, were preparing to give the French army a ſuitable reception. Monſieur Companie, with two or three hundred Canadians, in an advanced party, ſurpriſed two villages of the confederates, who, at the invitation and on the faith of the French, ſeated themſelves down about eight leagues from lake Fadarackui, or Ontario. To prevent their eſcape with intelligence to their countrymen, they were carried to the fort, and all but thirteen died in torments at the ſtake, ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with an heroic ſpirit, in their expiring moments, the perfidy of the French. The reſt, according to the expreſs
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:024800_0062_0FCD62DA292CBDB0"/>orders of the French king, were ſent to the galleys in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope. The marquis, having embarked his whole army in canoes, ſet out from the fort at Cadarackui, on the 23d of June, one half of them paſſing along the north and the other on the ſouth ſide of the lake; and both arrived the ſame day at Tyrondequait, and ſhortly after ſet out on their march towards the chief village of the Senecas, at about ſeven leagues diſtance. The main body was compoſed of the regulars and militia, the front and rear of the Indians and traders. The ſcouts advanced the ſecond day of their march, as far as the corn of the village, and within piſtol-ſhot of too Senecas, who lay upon their bellies undiſcovered. The French, who imagined the enemy were all fled, quickened their march to overtake the women and old men. But no ſooner had they reached the foot of a hill, about a mile from the village, than the Senecas raiſed the war ſhout, and in the ſame inſtant charged upon the whole army both in the front and rear. Univerſal confuſion enſued. The battalions divided, fired upon each other, and flew into the wood. The Senecas improved the diſorder of the enemy, till they were repulſed by the French Indians. According to Charlevoix's account, which may be juſtly ſuſpected, the enemy loſt but ſix men, and had twenty wounded in the conflict. Of the Senecas, he ſays, ſixty were wounded and forty five ſlain. The marquis was ſo much diſpirited, that he could not be perſuaded to purſue the enemy that day; which gave the Senecas an opportunity to burn their village, and get off. Two old men remained in the caſtle to receive the general, and regale the barbarity of his Indian allies. After deſtroying the corn in this and ſeveral other villages, the army retired to the banks of the lake, and erected a fort with four baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, on the ſouth-eaſt ſide of the ſtreights at Niagara, in which they left 100 men, under the command of Le Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier de la Troye, with eight months proviſions; but theſe being cloſely blocked up, all, except ſeven or eight of them, who were accidentally relieved, periſhed thro' famine<note n="*" place="bottom">Nothing can be more perfidious and unjuſt, than this attack upon our confederates. The two crowns had but juſt concluded a treaty for the preſervation of the peace: La Hontan, one of the French hiſtorians, cenſures De Nonville's conduct, and admits the Britiſh title to the command of the lakes, but Charlevoix blames him, as he does Hennepin, De L'Iſle and every other author, who confeſſes the truth, to the prejudice of the ambitious claims of the court of Frauce.</note> Soon after this expedition, colonel Dongan met the Five Nations
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:024800_0063_0FCD62DB8E13D608"/>at Albany. To what intent, appears from the ſpeech he made to them on the 5th of Auguſt, which I chooſe to lay before the reader, to ſhow his vigilance and zeal for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of his maſter, and the common weal of the province committed to his care.</p>

                        <p>I am very glad to ſee you here in this houſe, and am heartily glad that you have ſuſtained no greater loſs by the French, though I believe it was their intention to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy you all, if they could have ſurpriſed you in your caſtles.</p>
                        <p>As ſoon as I heard their deſign to war with you, I gave you notice, and came up hither myſelf, that I might be ready to give all the aſſiſtance and advice, that ſo ſhort a time would allow me.</p>
                        <p>I am now about ſending a gentleman to England, to the king, my maſter, to let him know, that the French have invaded his territories on this ſide of the great lake, and warred upon the brethren his ſubjects.

                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                        <p>I know the governor of Canada dare not enter into the king of England's territories, in a hoſtile manner, without provocation, if he thought the brethren were the king of England's ſubjects; but you have, two or three years ago, made a covenant-chain with the French, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my command (which I knew could not hold long) being void of itſelf among the chriſtians; foraſmuch as ſubjects (as you are) ought not to treat with any foreign nation, it not lying in your power. You have brought this trouble upon yourſelves; and, as I believe, this is the only reaſon of their falling on you at this time.</p>
                        <p>Brethren, I took it very ill, that after you had put yourſelves into the number of the great king of England's ſubjects, you ſhould ever offer to make peace or war, without my conſent. You know that we can live without you; but you cannot live without us; you never found that I told you a lie, and I offered you the aſſiſtance you wanted, provided that you would be adviſed by me; for I know the French better than any of you do.</p>
                        <p>Now ſince there is a war begun upon you by the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of Canada; I hope without any provocation by you
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:024800_0064_0FCD62E14789DEE0"/>given, I deſire and command you, that you hearken to no treaty but by my advice; which if you follow, you ſhall have the benefit of the great chain of friendſhip between the great king of England and the king of France, which came out of England the other day, and which I have ſent to Canada by Anthony le Junard; in the mean time, I will give you ſuch advice as will be for your good; and will ſupply you with ſuch neceſſaries as you will have need of.</p>
                        <p n="1">1ſt, My advice is, as to what priſoners of the French you ſhall take, that you draw not their blood, but bring them home, and keep them to exchange for your people, which they have priſoners already, or may take hereafter.</p>
                        <p n="2">2dly, That if it be poſſible, that you can order it ſo, I would have you take one or two of your wiſeſt ſachems, and one or two of your chief captains, of each nation, to be a council to manage all affairs of the war. They, to give or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to the reſt of the officers what they are to do, that your deſigns may be kept private; for after it comes among ſo many people, it is blazed abroad, and your deſigns are often fruſtrated; and thoſe chief men ſhould keep a correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with me by a truſty meſſenger.</p>
                        <p n="3">3dly, The great matter under conſideration with the brethren is, how to ſtrengthen themſelves, and weaken their enemy. My opinion is, that the brethren ſhould ſend meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the Utawawas, Twightwies, and the farther Indians, and to ſend back likewiſe ſome of the priſoners of theſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, if you have any left, to bury the hatchet, and to make a covenant-chain, that they may put away all the French that are among them, and that you will open a path for them this way (they being the king of England's ſubjects likewiſe, though the French have been admitted to trade with them; for all that the French have in Canada, they had it of the great king of England) that, by that means, they may come hither freely, where they may have every thing cheaper than among the French: that you and they may join together againſt the French, and make ſo firm a league, that whoever is an enemy to one, muſt be to both.</p>
                        <p n="4">4thly, Another thing of concern is, that you ought to do what you can, to open a path for all the north Indians and Mahikanders that are among the Utawawas and further nations. I will endeavour to do the ſame to bring them home. For, they not daring to return home your way, the French keep them there on purpoſe to join with the other nations againſt you, for your deſtruction; for you know, that one of them is worſe than ſix of the others; therefore all means muſt be uſed to bring them home, and uſe them kindly as they paſs through your country.</p>
                        <p n="5">
                           <pb n="69" facs="unknown:024800_0065_0FCD62E278C38268"/>
5thly, My advice further is, that meſſengers go, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of all the Five Nations, to the chriſtian Indians at Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada, to perſuade them to come home to their native coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. This will be another great means to weaken your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; but if they will not be adviſed, you know what to do with them.</p>
                        <p n="6">6thly, I think it very neceſſary, for the brethren's ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and aſſiſtance, and to the endamaging the French, to build a fort upon the lake, where I may keep ſtores and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, in caſe of neceſſity; and therefore I would have the brethren let me know what place will be moſt convenient for it.</p>
                        <p n="7">7thly, I would not have the brethren keep their corn in their caſtles, as I hear the Onondagas do, but bury it a great way in the woods, where few people may know where it is, for fear of ſuch an accident as has happened to the Senecas.</p>
                        <p n="8">8thly, I have given my advice in your general aſſembly, by mr. Dirk Weſſels and Akus, the interpreter, how you are to manage your parties, and how neceſſary it is to get priſoners to exchange for your own men that are priſoners with the French; and I am glad to hear that the brethren are ſo united as mr. Dirk Weſſels tells me you are, and that there was no rotten members nor French ſpies among you.</p>
                        <p n="9">9thly, The brethren may remember my advice, which I ſent you this ſpring, not to go to Cadarackui; if you had, they would have ſerved you, as they did your people that came from hunting thither, for I told you that I knew the French better than you did.</p>
                        <p n="10">10thly, There was no advice or propoſition that I made to the brethren all the time that the prieſt lived at Ononda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga, but what he wrote to Canada, as I found by one of his letters, which he gave to an Indian to carry to Canada, but which was brought hither; therefore, I deſire the brethren not to receive him, or any French prieſt any more, having ſent for Engliſh prieſts, with whom you may be ſupplied to your content.</p>
                        <p n="11">11thly, I would have the brethren look out ſharp, for fear of being ſurpriſed. I believe all the ſtrength of the French will be at their frontier places, viz. at Cadarackui, and Oniagara, where they have built a fort now, and at Trois Rivieres, Montreal, and Chambly.</p>
                        <p n="12">12thly, Let me put you in mind again, not to make any treaties without my means, which will be more advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for you, than your doing it for yourſelves; for then you will be looked upon as the king of England's ſubjects; and let me know, from time to time, every thing that is done.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="70" facs="unknown:024800_0066_0FCD62E3F3ABF378"/>

            <p>Not long after this interview, a conſiderable party of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haws and Mahikanders, or river Indians, beſet fort Chambly, burnt ſeveral houſes, and returned with many captives to Albany. Forty Onondagas, about the ſame time, ſurpriſed a few ſoldiers near fort Frontenac, whom they confined in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the Indians ſent home to the gallies, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the utmoſt addreſs was uſed to regain them, by Lamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, a French prieſt, who delivered them two belts, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage their kindneſs to the priſoners, and prevent their join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the quarrel with the Senecas. The belts being ſent to colonel Dongan, he wrote to De Nonville, to demand the reaſon of their being delivered. Pere le Vaillant was ſent here about the beginning of the year 1688, under colour of bringing an anſwer, but in reality as a ſpy Col. Dongan told him, that no peace could be made with the five nations, unleſs the Indians ſent to the gallies, and the Caghnuaga proſelytes were returned to their reſpective cantons, the forts at Niagara and Frontenac raiſed, and the Senecas had ſatisfaction made them, for the damage they had ſuſtained. The jeſuit, in his return, was ordered not to viſit the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawks.</p>
            <p>Dongan, who was fully ſenſible of the importance of the Indian intereſt to the Engliſh colonies, was for compelling the French to apply to him in all their affairs with the Five Nations; while they, on the other hand, were for treating with them independent of the Engliſh. For this reaſon, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others, he refuſed them the aſſiſtance they frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required, till they acknowledged the dependence of the confederates on the Engliſh crown. King James, a poor, bigotted, popiſh, prieſt-ridden prince, ordered his governor to give up this point, and to perſuade the Five Nations to ſend meſſengers to Canada, to receive propoſals of peace from the French. For this purpoſe, a ceſſation of arms and mutual delivery of priſoners was agreed upon. Near 1200 of the confederates attended this negociation at Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treal, and in their ſpeech to De Nonville, inſiſted with great reſolution, upon the terms propoſed by colonel Dongan to father le Vaillant. The French governor declared his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to put an end to the war, if all his allies might be included in the treaty of peace, if the Mohawks and Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas would ſend deputies to ſignify their concurrence, and the French might ſupply fort Frontenac with proviſions. The confederates, according to the French accounts, acced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to theſe conditions, and the treaty was ratified in the field. But a new rupture not long after enſued, from a cauſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely unſuſpected. The Dinondadies had lately inclined to
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:024800_0067_0FCD62E552782258"/>the Engliſh trade at Miſſilimakinac; and their alliance was therefore become ſuſpected by the French. Adario, their chief, thought to regain the ancient confidence, which had been repoſed in his countrymen, by a notable action againſt the Five Nations; and for that purpoſe put himſelf at the head of 100 men: nothing was more diſagreeable to him, than the proſpect of peace between the French and the confederates; for that event would not only render the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the Dinondadies uſeleſs, but give the French an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of reſenting their late favourable conduct towards the Engliſh. Impreſſed with theſe ſentiments, out of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his country, he intercepted the ambaſſadors of the Five Nations, at one of the falls in Cadarackui river, killed ſome, and took others priſoners, telling them that the French governor had informed him, that fifty warriors of the Five Nations were coming that way. As the Dinonda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and confederates were then at war, the ambaſſadors were aſtoniſhed at the perfidy of the French governor, and could not help communicating the deſign of their journey, Adario, in proſecution of his crafty ſcheme, counterfeited the utmoſt diſtreſs, anger, and ſhame, on being made the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious tool of de Nonville's treachery, and addreſſing himſelf to Dekaneſora, the principal ambaſſador, ſaid to him, "Go, my brethren, I untie your bonds, and ſend you home again, though our nations be at war. The French go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor has made me commit ſo black an action, that I ſhall never be eaſy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ter it, till the Five Nations ſhall have taken full revenge." This outrage and indignity upon the rights of ambaſſadors, the truth of which they did not in the leaſt doubt, animated the confederates, to the keeneſt thirſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter revenge; and accordingly 1200 of their men, on the 26th of July 1688, landed on the ſouth ſide of the iſland of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treal, while the French were in perfect ſecurity; burnt their houſes, ſacked their plantations, and put to the ſword all the men, women, and children, without the ſkirts of the town. A thouſand French were ſlain in this invaſion, and twenty ſix carried into captivity, and burnt alive. Many more were made priſoners in another attack in October, and the lower part of the iſland wholly deſtroyed. Only three of the confederates were loſt, in all this ſcene of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and deſolation<note n="*" place="bottom">I have followed dr. Colden in the account of this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack, who differs from Charlevoix. That jeſuit tells us, that the invaſion was late in Auguſt, and the Indians 1500 ſtrong; and as to the loſs of the French, he diminiſhes it to only 200 ſouls.</note>.</p>

Never before did Canada ſuſtain ſuch a heavy blow. The news of this attack on Montreal no ſooner reached the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon at the lake Ontario, than they ſet fire to the two barks, which they had built there, and abandoned the fort, leaving a match to 28 barrels of powder, deſigned to blow up the works. The ſoldiers went down the river in ſuch precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that one of the battoes and her crew were all loſt in ſhooting a fall. The confederates in the mean time ſeized the fort, the powder, and the ſtores; and of all the French allies, who were vaſtly numerous, only the Nepicirinians and Kikabous adhered to them in their calamities. The Utawawas and ſeven other nations inſtantly made peace with the Engliſh; and but for the uncommon ſagacity and addreſs of the ſieur Perot, the weſtern Indians would have murdered every Frenchman among them. Nor did the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes of the Canadians end here. Numerous ſcouts from the five nations, continually infeſted their borders. The fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent depredations that were made, prevented them from the cultivation of their fields, and a diſtreſſing famine raged through the whole country. Nothing but the ignorance of the Indians, in the art of attacking fortified places, ſaved Canada from being now utterly cut off. It was therefore unſpeakably fortunate to the French, that the Indians had no aſſiſtance from the Engliſh, and as unfortunate to us, that our colonies were then incapable of affording ſuccours to the confederates, through the malignant influence of thoſe execrable meaſures, which were purſued under the infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous reign of king James the ſecond. Colonel Dongan, whatever his conduct might have been in civil affairs, did all that he could in thoſe relating to the Indians, and fell at laſt into the king's diſpleaſure, through his zeal for the true intereſt of the province.</p>
            <p>While theſe things were tranſacting in Canada, a ſcene of the greateſt importance was opening at New-York. A general diſaffection to the government prevailed among the people. Papiſts began to ſettle in the colony, under the ſmiles of the governor. The collector of the revenues, and ſeveral principal officers, threw off the maſk, and openly avowed their attachment to the doctrines of Rome. A Latin ſchool was ſet up, and the teacher ſtrongly ſuſpected for a jeſuit. The people of Long-Iſland, who were diſappointed in their expectation of mighty boons, promiſed by the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor on his arrival, were become his perſonal enemies; and in a word, the whole body of the people trembled for the proteſtant cauſe. Here the leaven of oppoſition firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to work. Their intelligence from England, of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns there in favour of the prince of Orange, blew up the
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:024800_0069_0FCD62E932BA4078"/>coals of diſcontent, and elevated the hopes of the diſaffected. But no man dared to ſpring in action, till after the rupture in Boſton. Sir Edmond Androſs, who was perfectly devoted to the arbitrary meaſures of king James, by his tyranny in New-England, had drawn upon himſelf the univerſal odium of a people, animated with the love of liberty and in the defence of it reſolute and courageous; and therefore, when they could no longer endure his deſpotic rule, they ſeized and impriſoned him, and afterwards ſent him to England. The government, in the mean time, was veſted in the hands of a committee for the ſafety of the people, of which mr. Bradſtreet was choſen preſident. Upon the news of this event, ſeveral captains of our militia convened themſelves to concert meaſures, in favour of the prince of Orange. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theſe, Jacob Leiſler was the moſt active. He was a man in tolerable eſteem among the people, and of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate fortune, but deſtitute of every qualification neceſſary for the enterpriſe. Milborne, his ſon-in-law, and Engliſhman, directed all his councils, while Leiſler as abſolutely influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced the other officers.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing they contrived, was to ſeize the garriſon in New-York; and the cuſtom, at that time, of guarding it every night by the militia, gave Leiſler a fine opportunity of executing the deſign. He entered it with forty nine men, and determined to hold it till the whole militia ſhould join him. Colonel Dongan, who was about to leave the province, then lay embarked in the bay, having a little before reſigned the government to Francis Nicholſon, the lieutenant gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. The council, civil officers, and migiſtrates of the city, were againſt Leiſler, and therefore many of his friends were at firſt fearful of openly eſpouſing a cauſe diſapproved by the gentlemen of figure. For this reaſon, Leiſler's firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration in favour of the prince of Orange, was ſubſcribed only by a few, among ſeveral companies of the trained bands. While the people, for four days ſucceſſively, were in the utmoſt perplexity to determine what part to chooſe, being ſolicited by Leiſler on the one hand, and threatened by the lieutenant governor on the other, the town was alarmed with a report, that three ſhips were coming up, with or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from the prince of Orange. This falſehood was very ſeaſonably propagated to ſerve the intereſt of Leiſler; for on that day, the 3d of June 1689, his party was augmented by the addition of ſix captains and 400 men in New-York, and a company of 70 men from Eaſt Cheſter, who all ſubſcribed a
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:024800_0070_0FCD62EC4C2EE580"/>ſecond declaration<note n="*" place="bottom">I have taken an exact copy of it for the ſatisfaction of the reader. "Whereas our intention tended only but to the preſervation of the proteſtant religion, and the fort of this city, to the end that we may avoid and prevent the raſh judgment of the world, in ſo juſt a deſign; we have thought fit, to let every body know by theſe public proclamation, that till the ſafe arryvell of the ſhips, that we expect every day, from his royal highneſs the prince of Orange, with orders for the government of this country in the behalf of ſuch perſon, as the ſaid royal highneſs had choſen, and honoured with the charge of a governor, that as ſoon as the bearer of the ſaid orders, ſhall have let us ſee his power, then, and without any delay, we ſhall execute the ſaid or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders punctually; declaring that we do intend to ſubmit and obey, not only the ſaid orders, but alſo the bearer thereof, committed for the execution of the ſame. In witneſs hereof, we have ſigned theſe preſents, the third of June 1689."</note>, mutually covenanting to hold the fort for the prince. Colonel Dongan continued till this time in the harbour, waiting the iſſue of theſe commotions; and Nicholſon's party being now unable to contend with their opponents were totally diſperſed, the lieutenant governor himſelf abſconding, the very night after the laſt declaration was ſigned.</p>
            <p>Leiſler being now in complete poſſeſſion of the fort, ſent home an addreſs to king William and queen Mary, as ſoon as he received the news of their acceſſion to the throne. It is a tedious, incorrect, ill-drawn narrative of the grievances which the people had endured, and the methods lately ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to ſecure themſelves, ending with a recognition of the ſovereignty of the king and queen over the whole Engliſh dominions.</p>
            <p>This addreſs was ſoon followed by a private letter from Leiſler to king William, which, in very broken Engliſh, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms his majeſty of the ſtate of the garriſon, the repairs he had made to it, and the temper of the people, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes with ſtrong proteſtations of his ſincerity, loyalty, and zeal. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oſt Stoll, an enſign, on the delivery of this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the king, had the honour to kiſs his majeſty's hand; but Nicholſon the lieutenant-governor, and one Ennis, an epiſcopal clergyman, arrived in England before him; and by falſely repreſenting the late meaſures in New-York, as proceeding rather from their averſion to the church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, than zeal for the prince of Orange, Leiſler and his party miſſed the rewards and notice, which their activity
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:024800_0071_0FCD62EDBA095878"/>for the revolution juſtly deſerved. For though the king made Stoll the bearer of his thanks to the people for their fidelity, he ſo little regarded Leiſler's complaints againſt Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholſon, that he was ſoon after preferred to the government of Virginia. Dongan returned to Ireland, and, it is ſaid, ſucceeded to the earldom of Limerick.</p>
            <p>Leiſler's ſudden inveſtiture with ſupreme power over the province, and the probable proſpects of king William's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of his conduct, could not but excite the envy and jealouſy of the late council and magiſtrates, who had refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to join in the glorious work of the revolution; and hence the ſpring of all their averſion, both to the man and his meaſures. Colonel Bayard, and Courtland the mayor of the city, were at the head of his opponents, and finding it impoſſible to raiſe a party againſt him in the city, they very early retired to Albany, and there endeavoured to foment the oppoſition. Leiſler, on the other hand, fearful of their influence, and to extinguiſh the jealouſy of the people, thought it prudent, to admit ſeveral truſty perſons to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of that power, which the militia on the 1ſt of July had committed ſolely to himſelf. In conjunction with theſe, (who, after the Boſton example, were called the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of ſafety) he exerciſed the government, aſſuming to himſelf only the honour of being preſident in their councils. This model continued till the month of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, when a packet arrived with a letter from the lords Carmarthen, Halifax, and others, directed "To Francis Nicholſon, <abbr>eſq</abbr> or in his abſence, to ſuch as for the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, take care for preſerving the peace and adminiſtering the laws, in their majeſties' province of New-York in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica." This letter was dated the 29th of July, and was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with another from lord Nottingham, dated the next day, which, after empowering Nicholſon to take upon him the chief command, and to appoint for his aſſiſtance as many of the principal freeholders and inhabitants as he ſhould think fit, requiring alſo "to do every thing apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the office of lieutenant-governor, according to the laws and cuſtoms of New-York, until further orders."</p>
            <p>Nicholſon being abſconded when this packet came to hand, Leiſler conſidered the letter as directed to himſelf, and from this time iſſued all kinds of commiſſions in his own name, aſſuming the title, as well as authority, of lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-governor. On the 11th of December, he ſummoned the committee of ſafety, and agreeable to their advice, ſwore the following perſons for his council: Peter de Lanoy, Samuel Staats, Hendrick Janſen, and Johannes Vermilie, for New-York. Gerardus Beekman, for King's county. For
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:024800_0072_0FCD62EF11D82D20"/>Queen's county, Samuel Edſel; Thomas Williams for Weſt-Cheſter, and William Lawrence for Orange county.</p>
            <p>Except the eaſtern inhabitants of Long Iſland, all the ſouthern part of the colony chearfully ſubmitted to Leiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler's command. The principal freeholders, however, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful letters gave him hopes of their ſubmiſſion, and thereby prevented his betaking himſelf to arms, while they were privately ſoliciting the colony of Connecticut, to take them under its juriſdiction. They had, indeed, no averſion to Leiſler's authority, in favour of any other party in the province, but were willing to be incorporated with a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, from whence they had originally colonized; and therefore as ſoon as Connecticut declined their requeſt, they openly appeared to be advocates for Leiſler. At this junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the Long Iſland repreſentation was drawn up, which I have more than once had occaſion to mention.</p>
            <p>The people of Albany, in the mean time, were determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to hold the garriſon and city for king William, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of Leiſler; and on the 26th of October, which was before the packet arrived from lord Nottingham, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves into a convention for that purpoſe. As Leiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler's attempt, to reduce this country to his command, was the original cauſe of the future diviſions in the province, and in the end brought about his own ruin, it may not be improper to ſee the reſolution of the convention, a copy of which was ſent down to him at large.</p>

            <p>Taking it for granted, that Leiſler at New-York, and the convention at Albany, were equally affected to the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nothing could be more egregiouſly fooliſh, than the conduct of both parties, who, by their inteſtine diviſions, threw the province into convulſions, and ſowed the ſeeds of mutual hatred and animoſity, which, for a long time after, greatly embarraſſed the public affairs of the colony. When Albany declared for the prince of Orange, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe that Leiſler could properly require: and rather than ſacrifice the public peace of the province, to the trifling honour of reſiſting a man who had no evil deſigns, Albany ought in prudence to have delivered the garriſon into his hands, till the king's definitive orders ſhould arrive. But while Leiſler, on the one hand, was inebriated with his new-gotten power, ſo on the other, Bayard, Courtland, Schuyler, and others, could not brook a ſubmiſſion to the authority of a man, mean in his abilities, and inferior in his degree. Animated by theſe principles, both parties pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, the one to reduce, if I may uſe the expreſſion, the other to retain, the garriſon of Albany. Mr. Livingſton, a principal agent for the convention, retired into Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut, to ſolicit the aid of that colony, for the protection of the frontiers againſt the French. Leiſler, ſuſpecting that they were to be uſed againſt him, endeavoured not only to prevent theſe ſupplies, but wrote letters, to have Living<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:024800_0074_0FCD62F2CEFDD460"/>apprehended, as an enemy to the reigning powers, and, to procure ſuccours from Boſton, falſely repreſented the convention, as in the intereſt of the French and king James.</p>
            <p>Jacob Milborne was commiſſioned for the reduction of Albany. Upon his arrival there, a great number of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants armed themſelves, and repaired to the fort, then commanded by mr. Schuyler, while many others followed the other members of the convention, to a conference with him at the city-hall. Milborne, to proſelyte the crowd, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed much againſt king James, popery, and arbitrary power; but his oratory was loſt upon the hearers, who, after ſeveral meetings, ſtill adhered to the convention. Milborne then advanced with a few men up to the fort, and mr. Schuyler had the utmoſt difficulty to prevent both his own men, and the Mohawks, who were then in Albany, and perfectly devoted to his ſervice, from firing upon Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne's party, which conſiſted of an inconſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. In theſe circumſtances, he thought proper to retreat, and ſoon after departed from Albany. In the ſpring, he commanded another party upon the ſame errand; and the diſtreſs of the country, on an Indian irruption, gave him all the deſired ſucceſs. No ſooner was he poſſeſſed of the garriſon, than moſt of the principal members of the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion abſconded. Upon which, their effects were arbitrarily ſeized and confiſcated, which ſo highly exaſperated the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers, that their poſterity, to this day, cannot ſpeak of theſe troubles, without the bittereſt invectives againſt Leiſler and all his adherents.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of thoſe inteſtine confuſions at New-York, the people of New-England were engaged in a war with the Owenagungas, Ourages, and Penocoks. Between theſe and the Schakook Indians, there was then a friendly communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and the ſame was ſuſpected of the Mohawks, among whom, ſome of the Owenagungas had taken ſanctuary. This gave riſe to a conference, between ſeveral commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers from Boſton, Plymouth, and Connecticut, and the five nations, at Albany, in September 1689, the former endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to engage the latter, againſt thoſe eaſtern Indians, who were then at war with the New-England colonies. Tabajadoris, a Mohawk ſachem, in a long oration, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Engliſh meſſage; and, however improbable it may ſeem to Europeans, repeated all that had been ſaid the preceding day. The art they have in aſſiſting their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries is this. The ſachem who preſides, has a bundle of ſticks prepared for the purpoſe, and at the cloſe of every principal article of the meſſage delivered to them, gives a
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:024800_0075_0FCD62F8B873FEF0"/>ſtick to another ſachem, charging him with the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of it. By this means the orator, after a previous conference with the Indians, is prepared to repeat every part of the meſſage, and give it its proper reply. This cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom is invariably purſued in all their public treaties.</p>
            <p>The conference did not anſwer the expectation of the people of New-England, the five nations diſcovering a great diſinclination to join in the hoſtilities againſt the eaſtern Indians. To atone for which, they gave the higheſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations of their willingneſs to diſtreſs the French, againſt whom the Engliſh had declared war, on the 7th of May preceding. That part of the ſpeech ratifying their friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, with the Engliſh colonies, is ſingularly expreſſed. "We promiſe to preſerve the chain inviolably, and wiſh that the ſun may always ſhine in peace, over all our heads that are comprehended in this chain<note n="*" place="bottom">The Indians' conception of the league between them and us, is couched under the idea of a chain extended from a ſhip to a tree; and every renewal of this league they call brightening the chain.</note>. We give two belts. One for the ſun, and the other for its beams. We make faſt the roots of the tree of peace and tranquillity which is plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this place. Its roots extend as far as the utmoſt of your colonies; if the French ſhould come to ſhake this tree, we would feel it by the motion of its roots, which extend into our country. But we truſt it will not be in the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of Canada's power to ſhake this tree, which has been ſo firmly, and long planted with us."</p>
            <p>Nothing could have been more advantageous to theſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, and eſpecially to New-York, than the late ſucceſs of the five nations againſt Canada. The miſeries to which the French were reduced, rendered us ſecure againſt their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roads, till the work of the revolution was in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure accompliſhed; and to their diſtreſſed condition, we muſt principally aſcribe the defeat of the French deſign, about this time, to make a conqueſt of the province. De Callieres, who went to France in 1688, firſt projected the ſcheme<note n="†" place="bottom">Charlevoix has publiſhed an extract of the memorial preſented to the French king. The force demanded for this enterpriſe, was to conſiſt of 1300 regulars and 300 Canadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Albany was ſaid to be fortified only by an incloſure of ſtockadoes and a little fort with four baſtions; and that it contained by 150 ſoldiers and 300 inhabitants. That New-York, the capital of the province, was open, had a ſtone fort with four baſtions, and about four hundred inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, divided into eight companies.</note>; and the troubles in England encouraged the
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:024800_0076_0FCD62F99C6057E0"/>French court to make the attempt. Caffiniere commanded the ſhips, which ſailed for that purpoſe from Rochefort; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, nevertheleſs, to the count de Frontenac, who was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the land forces, deſtined to march from Canada, by the route of Sorel-River and the lake Champlain. The fleet and troops arrived at Chebucta, the place of rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, in September; from whence the count proceeded to Quebec, leaving orders with Caffiniere, to ſail for New-York, and continue in the bay, in ſight of the city, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the fire of our cannon, till the 1ſt of December; when, if he received no intelligence from him, he was ordered to return to France, after unlading the ammunition, ſtores, and proviſions at Port-Royal<note n="*" place="bottom">Now Annapolis.</note>. The count was in high ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and fully determined upon the enterpriſe, till he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at Quebec; where the news of the ſucceſs of the five nations againſt Montreal, the loſs of his favourite fort at lake Ontario, and the advanced ſeaſon of the year, defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ms, and broke up the expedition. De Nonville, who was recalled, carried the news of this diſappointment to the court of France, leaving the chief command of the country in the hands of count Frontenac. This gentleman was a man of co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ge, and well acquainted with the affairs of that country. He was then in the 68th year of his age, and yet ſo far from conſulting his eaſe, that in a few days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he landed at Quebec, he re-embarked in a canoe, for Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treal, where his preſence was abſolutely neceſſary, to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the inhabitants, and regain their Indian alliances. A war, between the Engliſh and French crowns, being broke out, the count betook himſelf to every art, for concluding a peace between Canada and the five nations; and for this purpoſe, the utmoſt civilities were ſhown to Taweraket and the other Indians, who had been ſent to France by de Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, and were now returned. Three of thoſe Indians, who, doubtleſs, were ſtruck with the grandeur and glory of the French monarch, were properly ſent on the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant meſſage of conciliating the friendſhip of the five na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Theſe, agreeable to our alliance, ſent two ſachems to Albany, in December, with notice, that a council for that purpoſe was to be held at Onondaga. It is a juſt reflexion upon the people of Albany, that they regarded the treaty
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:024800_0077_0FCD62FB13D0C100"/>ſo ſlightly, as only to ſend four Indians and the interpreter with inſtructions, in their name, to diſſuade the confederates from a ceſſation of arms; while the French, on the other hand, had then a jeſuit among the Oneydoes. The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil began on the 22d of January, 1690, and conſiſted of eighty ſachems. Sadekanaghtie, an Onondaga chief, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the conference. The whole was managed with great art and formality, and concluded in ſhowing a diſpoſition to make peace with the French, without perfecting it; guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at the ſame time, againſt giving the leaſt umbrage to the Engliſh.</p>
            <p>Among other meaſures to detach the five nations from the Britiſh intereſt, and raiſe the depreſſed ſpirit of the Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, the count de Frontenac thought proper to ſend out ſeveral parties againſt the Engliſh colonies. D'Aillebout, de Mantel, and le Moyne, commanded that againſt New-York, conſiſting of about two hundred French and ſome Caghnu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aga Indians, who being proſelytes from the Mohawks, were perfectly acquainted with that country. Their orders were, in general, to attack New-York; but purſuing the advice of the Indians, they reſolved, inſtead of Albany, to ſurpriſe Schenectady, a village ſeventeen miles north-weſt from it, and about the ſame diſtance from the Mohawks. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Schenectady, though they had been informed of the deſigns of the enemy; were in the greateſt ſecurity; judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it impracticable, for any men to march ſeveral hundred miles, in the depth of winter, through the ſnow, bearing their proviſions on their backs. Beſides, the village was in as much confuſion as the reſt of the province; the officers, who were poſted there, being unable to preſerve a regular watch, or any kind of military order. Such was the ſtate of Schenectady, as repreſented by colonel Schuyler, who was at that time mayor of the city of Albany, and at the head of the convention. A copy of his letter to the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring colonies, concerning this deſcent upon Schenectady dated the 15th of February 1689-90, I have now lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me under his own hand.</p>
            <p>After two and twenty days march, the enemy fell in with Schenectady, on the 8th of February; and were reduced to ſuch ſtreights, that they had thoughts of ſurrendering themſelves priſoners of war. But their ſcouts, who were a day or two in the village entirely unſuſpected, returned with ſuch encouraging accounts of the abſolute ſecurity of the people, that the enemy determined on the attack. They entered, on Saturday night, about eleven o'clock, at the gates, which were found unſhut; and, that every houſe might be inveſted at the ſame time, divided into ſmall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:024800_0078_0FCD57F5951FEDB0"/>of ſix, or ſeven men. The inhabitants were in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſleep, and unalarmed, till their doors were broke open. Never were people in a more wretched conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Before they were riſen from their beds, the enemy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered their houſes; and began the perpetration of the moſt inhuman barbarities. No tongue, ſays colonel Schuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, can expreſs the cruelties that were committed. The whole village was inſtantly in a blaze. Women with child ripped open, and their infants caſt into the flames, or daſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the poſts of the doors. Sixty perſons periſhed in the maſſacre, and twenty ſeven were carried into captivity. The reſt fled naked towards Albany, through a deep ſnow which fell that very night in a terrible ſtorm; and twenty-five of theſe fugitives loſt their limbs in the flight, through the ſeverity of the froſt. The news of this dreadful tragedy reached Albany, about break of day; and univerſal dread ſeized the inhabitants of that city, the enemy being report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be one thouſand four hundred ſtrong. A party of horſe was immediately diſpatched to Schenectady, and a few Mohawks then in the town, fearful of being intercept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were with difficulty ſent to appriſe their own caſtles.</p>
            <p>The Mohawks were unacquainted with this bloody ſcene, till two days after it happened; our meſſengers being ſcarce able to travel through the great depth of the ſnow. The ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, in the mean time, pillaged the town of Schenectady till noon the next day; and then went off with their plunder, and about forty of their beſt horſes. The reſt, with all the cattle they could find, lay ſlaughtered in the ſtreets.</p>
            <p>The deſign of the French, in this attack, was to alarm the fears of our Indian allies, by ſhowing that we were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of defending them. Every art alſo was uſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliate their friendſhip; for they not only ſpared thoſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawks who were found in Schenectady, but ſeveral other particular perſons in compliment to the Indians, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted that favour. Several women and children were alſo releaſed at the deſire of captain Glen, to whom the French offered no violence; the officer declaring he had ſtrict or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders againſt it, on the ſcore of his wife's civilities to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain French captives, in the time of colonel Dongan.</p>
            <p>The Mohawks, conſidering the cajoling arts of the French, and that the Caghnuagas who were with them, were once a part of their own body, behaved as well as could be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably expected. They joined a party of young men from Albany, fell upon the rear of the enemy, and either killed or captivated five and twenty. Several ſachems, in the mean time, came to Albany, and very affectingly addreſſed the inhabitants, who were juſt ready to abandon the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:024800_0079_0FCD62FFA2838688"/>urging their ſtay, and exciting a union of all the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh colonies againſt Canada. Their ſentiments concerning the French appear from the following ſpeech of condo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. "Brethren, we do not think, that what the French have done can be called a victory: it is only a farther proof of their cruel deceit: the governor of Canada ſent to Onondaga, and talks to us of peace with our whole houſe; but war was in his heart, as you now ſee by woful experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. He did the ſame, formerly, at Cadaraqui, and in the Seneca's country. This is the third time he has acted ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully. He has broken open our houſe, at both ends; formerly in the Seneca's country, and now here. We hope however to be revenged of them."</p>
            <p>Agreeable to this declaration, the Indians ſoon after treated the chevalier d'Eau and the reſt of the French meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, who came to conclude the peace propoſed by Taweraket, with the utmoſt indignity; and afterwards delivered them up to the Engliſh. Beſides this, their ſcouts harraſſed the borders of the enemy, and ſell upon a party of French and Indians, in the river, about one hundred and twenty miles above Montreal, under the command of Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigni, a captain who was going to Miſſilimakinac, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the concluſion of the peace, between the Utawawas and Quatoghies, with the five nations. The loſs in this ſkirmiſh was nearly equal on both ſides. One of our priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers was delivered to the Utawawas, who ate him. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge for this barbarity, the Indians attacked the iſland of Montreal at Trembling Point, and killed an officer and twelve men; while another party carried off about fifteen priſoners taken at Riviere Puan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e, whom they afterwards ſlew, through fear of their purſuers; and others burnt the French plantations at St. Aeurs. But what rendered this year moſt remarkable, was the expedition of ſir William Phips againſt Quebec. He ſailed up the river with a fleet of thirty-two ſail, and came before the city in October. Had he improved his time and ſtrength, the conqueſt would have been eaſy; but by ſpending three days in idle conſultations, the French governor brought in his forces, and entertained ſuch a mean opinion of the Engliſh knight, that he not only deſpiſed his ſummons to ſurrender, but ſent a verbal anſwer, in which he called king William an uſurper, and poured the utmoſt contempt upon his ſubjects. The meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger, who carried the ſummons, inſiſted upon a written anſwer, and that within an hour; but the count de Frontenac abſolutely refuſed it, adding, "I'll anſwer your maſter by the mouth of my cannon, that he may learn that a man of my condition is not to be ſummoned in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner."
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:024800_0080_0FCD63048CA01610"/>Upon this, ſir William made two attempts to land below the town, but was repulſed by the enemy, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable loſs of men, cannon and baggage. Several of the ſhips alſo cannonaded the city, but without any ſucceſs. The forts at the ſame time returned the fire and obliged them to retire in diſorder. The French writers, in their accounts of this expedition, univerſally cenſure the conduct of ſir William, though they confeſs the valour of his troops. La Hontan, who was then at Quebec, ſays, he could not have acted in a manner more agreeable to the French, if he had been in their intereſt<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Colden ſuppoſes this attack was made upon Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bec, in 1691, but he is certainly miſtaken; ſee life of ſir William Phips, publiſhed at London in 1697,—Oldmixon's Brit. Empire,—and Charlevoix.
<p>Among the cauſes of the ill ſucceſs of the fleet, the author of the life of ſir William Phips, mentions the neglect of the conjoined troops of New-York, Connecticut, and the Indians, to attack Montreal, according to the original plan of operations. He tells us, that they marched to the lake, but there found themſelves unprovided with batteaux, and that the Indians were diſſuaded from the attempt. By what authority theſe aſſertions may be ſupported, I know not. Charlevoix ſays, our army was diſappointed in the intended diverſion, by the ſmall-pox, which ſeized the camp, killed three hundred men, and terrified our Indian allies.</p>

            <p>WHILE our allies were faithfully exerting themſelves againſt the common enemy, colonel Henry Slough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who had a commiſſion to be governor of this province, dated 4th of January, 1689, arrived here, and publiſhed it on the 19th of March, 1691. Never was a governor more neceſſary to the province, than at this critical conjuncture; as well for reconciling a divided people, as for defending them againſt the wiles of a cunning adverſary. But, either through the hurry of the king's affairs, or the powerful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of a favourite, a man was ſent over, utterly deſtitute of every qualification for government, licentious in his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, avaricious, and poor. The council preſent at his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val were

            <p>If Leiſler had delivered the garriſon to colonel Slough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as he ought to have done, upon his firſt landing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides extinguiſhing, in a great degree, the animoſities then ſubſiſting, he would, doubtleſs, have attracted the favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble notice, both of the governor and the crown. But being a weak man, he was ſo intoxicated with the love of power, that, though he had been well informed of Sloughter's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment to the government, he not only ſhut himſelf up
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:024800_0082_0FCD630710222850"/>in the fort with Bayard and Nichols, whom he had, before that time, impriſoned, but refuſed to deliver them up, or to ſurrender the garriſon. From this moment, he loſt all credit with the governor, who joined the other party againſt him. On the ſecond demand of the fort, Milborne and Delanoy came out, under pretence of conferring with his excellency, but in reality to diſcover his deſigns. Slough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who conſidered them as rebels, threw them both into goal. Leiſler, upon this event, thought proper to abandon the fort, which colonel Sloughter immediately entered. Bayard and Nichols were now releaſed from their confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſworn of the privy council. Leiſler having thus ruined his cauſe, was apprehended with many of his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and a commiſſion of oyer and terminer iſſued to ſir Thomas Robinſon, colonel Smith, and others, for their trials.</p>
            <p>In vain did they plead the merit of their zeal for king William, ſince they had ſo lately oppoſed his governor. Leiſler, in particular, endeavoured to juſtify his conduct, inſiſting, that lord Nottingham's letter entitled him to act in the quality of lieutenant-governor. Whether it was through ignorance or ſycophancy, I know not: but the judges, inſtead of pronouncing their own ſentiments upon this part of the priſoner's defence, referred it to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor and council, praying their opinion, whether that letter "or any other letters, or papers, in the packet from White-hall, can be underſtood, or interpreted, to be and contain, any power, or direction to captain Leiſler, to take the government of this province upon himſelf, or that the adminiſtration thereupon be holden good in law." The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was, as might have been expected, in the negative; and Leiſler and his ſon were condemned to death for high treaſon. Theſe violent meaſures drove many of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, who were fearful of being apprehended into the neighbouring colonies, which ſhortly after occaſioned the paſſing an act of general indemnity.</p>
            <p>From the ſurrender of the province, to the year 1683, the inhabitants were ruled by the duke's governors and their councils, who, from time to time, made rules and orders, which were eſteemed to be binding as laws. Theſe, about the year 1674, were regularly collected under alphabetical titles; and a fair copy of them remains, among our records, to this day. They are commonly known by the name of the duke's laws. The title page of the book, written in the old court hand, is in theſe bald words,</p>

            <p>Before this houſe proceeded to paſs any acts, they unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly reſolved: "That all the laws conſented to by the general aſſembly, under James duke of York, and the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and privileges therein contained, granted to the people, and declared to be their rights, not being obſerved, nor ratified and approved by his royal highneſs, nor the late
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:024800_0085_0FCD630DE6FDEB18"/>king, are null and void, and of none effect; and alſo, the ſeveral ordinances, made by the late governors and councils, being contrary to the conſtitution of England, and the practice of the government of their majeſties' other plantations in America, are likewiſe null and void, and of no effect, nor force, within this province."</p>
            <p>Among the principal laws enacted at this ſeſſion, we may mention that for eſtabliſhing the revenue, which was drawn into precedent. The ſums raiſed by it, were made payable into the hands of the receiver-general, and iſſued by the governor's warrant. By this means the governor became, for a ſeaſon, independent of the people; and hence we find frequent inſtances of the aſſemblies contending with him for the diſcharge of debts to private perſons, contracted on the faith of the government.</p>
            <p>Antecedent to the revolution, innumerable were the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies relating to public townſhips and private rights; and hence, an act was now paſſed, for the confirmation of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient patents and grants, intended to put an end to thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates. A law was alſo paſſed for the eſtabliſhment of courts of juſtice, tho' a perpetual act had been made to that purpoſe in 1683, and the old court of aſſize entirely diſſolved in 1684. As this enacted in 1691, was a temporary law, it may hereafter be diſputed, as it has been already, whether the preſent eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of our courts, for general juriſdiction, by an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, can conſiſt even with the preceding act, or the general rules of law. Upon the erection of the ſupreme court, a chief juſtice, and four aſſiſtant judges, with an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney general, were appointed. The chief juſtice, Joſeph Dudley, had a ſalary of 130<abbr>l.</abbr> per annum: Johnſon, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond judge, 100<abbr>l.</abbr> and both were payable out of the revenue: but William Smith, Stephen Van Courtlandt, and William Pinhorne, the other judges, and Newton, the attorney-gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral, had nothing allowed for their ſervices.</p>
            <p>It has, more than once, been a ſubject of animated debate, whether the people, in this colony, have a right to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in aſſembly, or whether it be a privilege enjoyed, thro' the grace of the crown. A memorable act, paſſed this ſeſſion, virtually declared in favour of the former opinion, upon that, and ſeveral other of the principal and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing liberties of Engliſhmen. It muſt, nevertheleſs, be confeſſed, that king William was afterwards pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal that law, in the year 1697<note n="*" place="bottom">It was entitled, "An act declaring what are the rights and privileges of their majeſties' ſubjects, inhabiting within their province of New-York."</note>.</p>

Colonel Sloughter propoſed, immediately after the ſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to ſet out to Albany; but as Leiſler's party were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged at his impriſonment, and the late ſentence againſt him, his enemies were afraid new troubles would ſpring up in the abſence of the governor; for this reaſon, both the aſſembly and council adviſed that the priſoners ſhould be immediately executed. Sloughter, who had no inclination to favour them in this requeſt, choſe rather to delay ſuch a violent ſtep, being fearful of cutting off two men, who had vigorouſly appeared for the king, and ſo ſignally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the revolution. Nothing could be more diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their enemies, whoſe intereſt was deeply concerned in their deſtruction. And therefore, when no other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures could prevail with the governor, tradition informs us, that a ſumptuous feaſt was prepared, to which colonel Sloughter was invited. When his excellency's reaſon was drowned in his cups, the intreaties of the company pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with him to ſign the death warrant, and, before he recovered his ſenſes, the priſoners were executed. Leiſler's ſon afterwards carried home a complaint to king William, againſt the governor. His petition was referred, according to the common courſe of plantation affairs, to the lords com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of trade, who, after hearing the whole matter, reported on the 11th of March 1692, "That they were hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of opinion, that Jacob Leiſler and Jacob Milborne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, were condemned and had ſuffered according to law." Their lordſhips, however, interceded for their families, as fit objects of mercy: and this induced queen Mary, who approved the report, on the 17th of March, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, "That upon the humble application of the relations of the ſaid Jacob Leiſler and Jacob Milborne deceaſed, her majeſty will order the eſtates of Jacob Leiſler and Jacob Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne; to be reſtored to their families, as objects of her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's mercy." The bodies of theſe unhappy ſufferers were afterwards taken up and interred, with great pomp, in the old Dutch church, in the city of New-York. Their eſtates were reſtored to their families; and Leiſler's children, in the public eſtimation, are rather dignified, than diſgraced, by the fall of their anceſtor.</p>
            <p>Theſe diſtractions, in the province, ſo entirely engroſſed the public attention, that our Indian allies, who had been loft ſolely to contend with the common enemy, grew ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely diſaffected. The Mohawks, in particular, highly reſented this conduct, and, at the inſtance of the Caghnu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agaes, ſent a meſſenger to Canada, to confer with count Frontenac about a peace. To prevent this, colonel Slough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had an interview at Albany, in June, with the other
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:024800_0087_0FCD631117975E20"/>four nations, who expreſſed their joy at ſeeing a governor again in that place. They told him, that their anceſtors, as they had been informed, were greatly ſurpriſed at the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of the firſt ſhip in that country, and were curious to know what was in its huge belly. That they found chriſtians in it, and one Jacques, with whom they made a chain of friendſhip, which they had preſerved to this day. All the Indians, except the Mohawks, aſſured the governor at this meeting, of their reſolution to proſecute the war. The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawks confeſſed their negociations with the French, that they had received a belt from Canada, and prayed the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the governor, and afterwards renewed their league with all our colonies.</p>
            <p>Sloughter ſoon after returned to New-York, and ended a ſhort, weak, and turbulent adminiſtration; for he died ſuddenly on the 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d of July 1691. Some were not without ſuſpicions, that he came unfairly to his end: but the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate of the phyſician and ſurgeons who opened his body, by an order of council, confuted theſe conjectures; and his remains were interred in Stuyveſant's vault, next to thoſe of the old Dutch governor.</p>
            <p>At the time of Sloughter's deceaſe, the government de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved, according to the late act for declaring the rights of the people of this province, on the council, in which Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph Dudley had a right to preſide: but they committed the chief command to Richard Ingolſby, a captain of an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent company, who was ſworn into the office of preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on the the 26th of July 1698. Dudley, ſoon afterwards, returned to this province, from Boſton, but did not think proper to diſpute Ingolſby's authority, though the latter had no title, nor the greateſt abilities for government, and was beſides obnoxious to the party who had joined Leiſler, having been an agent in the meaſures which accompliſhed his ruin. To the late troubles, which were then recent, and the agreement ſubſiſting between the council and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly we muſt aſcribe it, that the former tacitly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Ingolſby's right to the preſident's chair; for they concurred with him, in paſſing ſeveral laws, in autumn and the ſpring following, the validity of which have never yet been diſputed.</p>
            <p>This ſummer, mayor Schuyler<note n="*" place="bottom">The French, from his great influence at Albany, and activity among the Indians, concluded that he was gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of that city; and hence, their hiſtorians honour him with that title, though he was then only mayor of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration. "Pierre Schuyler (ſays Charlevoix) <hi>etoit un fort honnete homme.</hi>"</note>, with a party of Mohawks,
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:024800_0088_0FCD63124EC47CB0"/>paſſed through the lake Champlain, and made a bold irrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the French ſettlements, at the north end of it.<note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. Colden relates it as a tranſaction of the year 1691, which is true: but he ſuppoſes it was before ſir William Phips's attack upon Quebec, and thus falls into an anachron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm of a whole year, as I have already obſerved.</note> De Callieres, the governor of Montreal, to oppoſe him, collected a ſmall army, of eight hundred men, and encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at la Prairie. Schuyler had ſeveral conflicts with the enemy, and ſlew about three hundred of them, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in number his whole party. The French, aſhamed of their ill ſucceſs, attribute it to the want of order, too many deſiring to have the command. But the true cauſe was, the ignorance of their officers in the Indian manner of fighting. They kept their men in a body, while ours poſted themſelves behind trees, hidden from the enemy. Major Schuyler's deſign, in this deſcent, was to animate the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and preſerve their enmity with the French. They, accordingly, continued their hoſtilities againſt them, and, by frequent incurſions, kept the country in conſtant alarm.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of theſe diſtreſſes, the French governor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved his ſprightlineſs and vigour, animating every body about him. After he had ſerved himſelf of the Utawawas, who came to trade at Montreal, he ſent them home under the care of a captain and one hundred and ten men; and to ſecure their attachment to the French intereſt, gave them two Indian priſoners, and, beſides, ſent very conſiderable preſents to the weſtern Indians, in their alliance. The cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives were afterwards burnt. The five nations, in the mean time, grew more and more incenſed, and continually har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed the French borders. Mr. Beaucour, a young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, in the following winter, marched a body of about three hundred men to attack them at the iſthmus, at Niaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra. Incredible were the fatigues they underwent in this long march over the ſhow, bearing their proviſions on their backs. Eighty men, of the five nations, oppoſed the French party, and bravely maintained their ground, till moſt of them were cut off. In return for which, the confederates, in ſmall parties, obſtructed the paſſage of the French through lake Ontario, and the river iſſuing out of it, and
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:024800_0089_0FCD63141AE9F420"/>cut off their communication with the weſtern Indians. An Indian, called Black Kettle, commanded in theſe incurſions of the five nations, and his ſucceſſes, which continued the whole ſummer, ſo exaſperated the count, that he ordered an Indian priſoner to be burnt alive. The bravery of this ſavage was as extraordinary, as the torments inflicted on him were cruel. He ſung his military achievements without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption, even while his bloody executioners practiſed all poſſible barbarities. They broiled his feet, thruſt his fingers into red hot pipes, cut his joints, and twiſted the ſinews with bars of iron. After this his ſcalp was ripped off, and hot ſand poured on the wound.</p>
            <p>In June 1692, captain Ingolſby met the five nations, at Albany, and encouraged them to perſevere in the war. The Indians declared their enmity to the French, in the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt terms, and as heartily profeſſed their friendſhip to us. "Brother Corlear," ſaid the ſachem, "we are all ſubjects of one great king and queen: we have one head, one heart, one intereſt, and are all engaged in the ſame war." The Indians, at the ſame time, did not forget, at this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview, to condemn the inactivity of the Engliſh, telling them, that the deſtruction of Canada would not make one ſummer's work, againſt their united ſtrength, if vigorouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerted.</p>
            <p>Colonel Benjamin Fletcher arrived with a commiſſion to be governor, on the 29th of Auguſt, 1692, which was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed the next day, before the following members, in council:</p>

               <item>Frederick Philipſe,</item>

            </list>
            <p>William Pinhorne, one of that board, being a non-reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, was refuſed the oaths; and Joſeph Dudley, for the ſame reaſon, removed, both from his ſeat in council, and his office of chief juſtice. Caleb Heath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ote and John Young ſucceeded them in council: and William Smith was ſeated, in Dudley's place, on the bench.</p>
            <p>Colonel Fletcher brought over with him a preſent to the colony, of arms, ammunition, and warlike ſtores; in grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for which, he exhorted the council and aſſembly, who were ſitting at his arrival, to ſend home an addreſs of thanks to the king. It conſiſts, principally, of a repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the great expenſe the province was continually at to defend the frontiers, and praying his majeſty's direction, that the neighbouring colonies might be compelle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> to join their aid, for the ſupport of Albany. The following paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:024800_0090_0FCD63154D326EE8"/>in it ſhows the ſenſe of the legiſlature, upon a matter which has ſince been very much debated. "When theſe countries were poſſeſſed by the Dutch Weſt-India company, they always had pretences (and had the moſt part of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their actual juriſdiction) to all that tract of land (with the iſlands adjacent) extending, from the weſt ſide of Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut river, to the lands lying on the weſt ſide of Delaware bay, as a ſuitable portion of land for one colony or govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; all which, including the lands on the weſt of Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware bay or river, were in the duke of York's grant, from his majeſty king Charles the ſecond, whoſe governors alſo poſſeſſed thoſe lands on the weſt ſide of Delaware bay or river. By ſeveral grants, as well from the crown, as from the duke, the ſaid province has been ſo diminiſhed, that it is now decreaſed to a very few towns and villages; the number of men fit to bear arms, in the whole government, not amounting to 3000, who are all reduced to great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty."</p>
            <p>Fletcher was by profeſſion a ſoldier, a man of ſtrong paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and inconſiderable talents, very active, and equally avaricious. Nothing could be more fortunate to him, than his early acquaintance with major Schuyler, at Albany, at the treaty, for confirmation of the Indian alliance, the fall after his arrival. No man, then in this province, underſtood the ſtate of our affairs with the five nations better than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Schuyler. He had ſo great an influence over them, that whatever Quider<note n="*" place="bottom">Inſtead of Peter, which they could not pronounce.</note>, as they called him, recommended or diſapproved, had the force of a law. This power over them was ſupported, as it had been obtained, by repeated offices of kindneſs, and his ſingular bravery and activity in the defence of his country. Theſe qualifications rendered him ſingularly ſerviceable and neceſſary, both to the province and the governor. For this reaſon, Fletcher took him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his confidence, and, on the 25th of October, raiſed him to the council board. Under the tutelage of major Schuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, the governor became daily more and more acquainted with our Indian affairs; his conſtant application to which, procured and preſerved him a reputation and influence in the colony. Without this knowledge, and which was all that he had to diſtinguiſh himſelf, his inceſſant ſolicitations for money, his paſſionate temper and bigotted principles, muſt neceſſarily have rendered him obnoxious to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and kindled a hot fire of contention in the province.</p>
            <p>The old French governor, who found that all his meaſures for accompliſhing a peace with the five nations, proved abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:024800_0091_0FCD6319C25248B8"/>was now meditating a blow on the Mohawks. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly collected an army of ſix or ſeven hundred French and Indians, and ſupplied them with every thing neceſſary for a winter campaign. They ſet out from Montreal, on the 15th of January, 1693; and after a march attended with incredible hardſhips, they paſſed by Schenectady, on the 6th of February, and, that night, captivated five men and ſome women and children, at the firſt caſtle of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawks. The ſecond caſtle was taken with equal eaſe, the Indian inhabitants being in perfect ſecurity, and, for the moſt part, at Schenectady. At the third, the enemy found about forty Indians in a war dance, deſigning to go out, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome enterpriſe, the next day. Upon their entering the caſtle a conflict enſued, in which the French loſt about thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty men. Three hundred of our Indians were made captives, in this deſcent; and, but for the interceſſion of the ſavages in the French intereſt, would all have been put to the ſword<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Colden and the jeſuit Charlevoix are not perfectly agreed in the hiſtory of this irruption. I have followed, ſometimes the former, and at other times the latter; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the facts, more immediately, related to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of their reſpective countrymen.</note>.</p>
            <p>The Indians were enraged, and with good reaſon, at the people of Schenectady, who gave them no aſſiſtance againſt the enemy, though they had notice of their marching by that village. But this was atoned for by the ſuccours from Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany. Colonel Schuyler voluntarily headed a party of two hundred men, and went out againſt the enemy. On the 15th of February, he was joined by near three hundred Indians, ill armed, and many of them boys. A pretended deſerter, who came to diſſuade the Indians from the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, informed him, the next day, that the French had built a fort, and waited to fight him; upon which he ſent to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>golſby, the commandant at Albany, as well for a reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as for a ſupply of proviſions; for the greateſt part of his men came out, with only a few biſcuits in their pockets, and at the time they fell in with the enemy, on the 17th of the month, had been ſeveral days without any kind of food. Upon approaching the French army, ſundry ſkirmiſhes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued; the enemy endeavouring to prevent our Indians from felling trees for their protection. Captain Syms, with eighty regulars of the independent companies, and a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of proviſions, arrived on the 19th; but the enemy had marched off the day before in a great ſnow ſtorm. Our party
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:024800_0092_0FCD631BA40D37B0"/>however purſued them, and would have attacked their rear, if the Mohawks had not been averſe to it. When the French reached the north branch of Hudſon's river, luckily a cake of ice ſerved them to croſs over it, the river being open both above and below. The froſt was now extremely ſevere, and the Mohawks fearful of an engagement; upon which Schuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, who had retaken about fifty Indian captives, deſiſted from the purſuit on the 20th of February; four of his men and as many Indians being killed, and twelve wounded. Our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, at this time, were ſo diſtreſſed for proviſions, that they fed upon the dead bodies of the French; and the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, in their turn, were reduced, before they got home, to eat up their ſhoes. The French in this enterpriſe loſt eighty men, and had above thirty wounded.</p>
            <p>Fletcher's extraordinary diſpatch up to Albany, upon the firſt news of this deſcent, gained the eſteem both of the public and our Indian allies.</p>
            <p>The expreſs reached New-York on the 12th of February, at ten o'clock in the night, and in leſs than two days, the governor embarked with three hundred volunteers. The river, which was heretofore very uncommon at that ſeaſon, was open<note n="*" place="bottom">The climate of late years is much altered, and this day (February 14, 1756) three hundred recruits ſailed from New-York for the army under the command of general Shirley, now quartered at Albany; and laſt year, a ſloop went up the river a month earlier.</note>. Fletcher landed at Albany, and arrived at Schenectady, the 17th of the month, which is about one hundred and ſixty miles from New-York: but he was ſtill too late to be of any other uſe than to ſtrengthen the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent alliance. The Indians, in commendation of his activity on the occaſion, gave him the name of Cayenguirago, or, the great ſwift arrow.</p>
            <p>Fletcher returned to New-York, and, in March, met the aſſembly, who were ſo well pleaſed with his late vigilance, that beſides giving him the thanks of the houſe, they raiſed 6000<abbr>l.</abbr> for a year's pay of three hundred volunteers, and their officers, for the defence of the frontiers.</p>
            <p>As the greateſt part of this province conſiſted of Dutch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, all our governors, as well in the duke's time, as after the revolution, thought it good policy to encourage Engliſh preachers and ſchoolmaſters in the colony. No man could be more bent upon ſuch a project than Fletcher, a bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got to the eſpiſcopal form of church government. He, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, recommended this matter to the aſſembly, on his
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:024800_0093_0FCD631CDC6B6400"/>firſt arrival, as well as at their preſent meeting. The houſe, from their attachment to the Dutch language, and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of the church of Holland, ſecured by one of the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of ſurrender, were entirely diſinclined to the ſcheme, which occaſioned a warm rebuke from the governor, in his ſpeech at the cloſe of the ſeſſion, in theſe words; "gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the firſt thing that I did recommend to you, at our laſt meeting, was to provide for a miniſtry, and nothing is done in it. There are none of you, but what are big with the privileges of Engliſhment and magna charta, which is your right; and the ſame law doth provide for the religion of the church of England, againſt ſabbath-breaking, and all other profanity. But as you have made it laſt, and poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned it this ſeſſion, I hope you will begin with it the next meeting, and do ſomewhat toward it effectually."</p>
            <p>The news of the arrival of the recruits and ammunition at Canada, the late loſs of the Mohawks, and the unfulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed promiſes of aſſiſtance, made from time to time, by the Engliſh, together with the inceſſant ſolicitations of Milet, the jeſuit, all conſpired to induce the Oneydoes to ſue for a peace with the French. To prevent ſo important an event, Fletcher met the five nations at Albany, in July 1693, with a conſiderable preſent of knives, hatchets, clothing, and ammunition, which had been ſent over, by the crown, for that purpoſe. The Indians conſented to a renewal of the ancient league, and expreſſed their gratitude, for the king's donation, with ſingular force. "Brother Cayenguirago, we roll and wallow in joy, by reaſon of the great favour the great king and queen have done us, in ſending us arms and ammunition at a time when we are in the greateſt need of them; and becauſe there is ſuch unity among the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren." Colonel Fletcher preſſed their delivering up to him Milet, the old prieſt, which they promiſed, but never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. On the contrary, he had influence enough to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade all, but the Mohawks, to treat about the peace at Onondaga, though the governor exerted himſelf to prevent it.</p>
            <p>Soon after this interview, Fletcher returned to New-York; and, in September, met a new aſſembly, of which James Graham was choſen ſpeaker. The governor laboured, at this ſeſſion, to procure the eſtabliſhment of a miniſtry throughout the colony, a revenue to his majeſty for life, the repairing the fort in New-York, and the erection of a chapel. That part of his ſpeech, relating to the miniſtry, was in theſe words: "I recommended to the former aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, the ſettling of an able miniſtry, that the worſhip of God may be obſerved among us; for I find that great and firſt
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:024800_0094_0FCD631E50F5E370"/>duty very much neglected. Let us not forget that there is a God, that made us, who will protect us, if we ſerve him. This has been always the firſt thing I have recommended, yet the laſt in your conſideration. I hope you are all ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the great neceſſity and duty, that lies upon you to do this, as you expect his bleſſing upon your labours." The zeal with which this affair was recommended, induced the houſe, on the 12th of September, to appoint a committee of eight members, to agree upon a ſcheme for ſettling a miniſtry, in each reſpective precinct, throughout the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. This committee made a report the next day; but it was recommitted till the afternoon, and then deferred to the next morning. Several debates ariſing about the report, in the houſe, it was again "recommitted for farther conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion." On the 15th of September, it was approved, the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhment being then limited to ſeveral pariſhes in four countries, and a bill ordered to be brought in accordingly; which the ſpeaker (who, on the 18th of September, was appointed to draw all their bills) produced on the 19th. It was read twice on the ſame day, and then referred to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the whole houſe. The third reading was on the 21ſt of September, when the bill paſſed, and was ſent up to the governor and council, who immediately returned it with an amendment, to veſt his excellency with an epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal power of inducting every incumbent, adding to that part of the bill near the end, which gave the right of the preſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the people, theſe words "and preſented to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, to be approved and collated." The houſe declined their conſent to the addition, and immediately returned the bill, praying, "that it may paſs without the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, having, in the drawing of the bill, had a due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to that pious intent of ſettling a miniſtry, for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the people." Fletcher was ſo exaſperated with their refuſal, that he no ſooner received the anſwer of the houſe, than he convened them before him, and in an angry ſpeech broke up the ſeſſion. I ſhall lay that part of it, relating to this bill, before the reader, becauſe it is characteriſtic of the man.</p>

                        <p>There is alſo a bill for ſettling a miniſtry in this city, and ſome other countries of the government. In that very thing you have ſhown a great deal of ſtiffneſs. You take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, as if you were dictators. I ſent down to you an amendment of three or four words in that bill, which, though very immaterial, yet was poſitively denied. I muſt tell you, it ſeems very unmannerly. There never was an amendment yet deſired by the council board, but what was
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:024800_0095_0FCD631FED726A28"/>rejected. It is the ſign of a ſtubborn ill temper, and this have alſo paſſed.</p>

For I have the power of collating or ſuſpending any miniſter, in my government, by their majeſties' letters pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; and whilſt I ſtay in the government, I will take care, that neither hereſy, ſedition, ſchiſm, or rebellion, be preached among you, nor vice and profanity encouraged. It is my endeavour, to lead a virtuous and pious life amongſt you, and to give a good example: I wiſh you all to do the ſame. You ought to conſider, that you have but a third ſhare in the legiſlative power of the government; and ought not to take all upon you, nor be ſo peremptory. You ought to let the council have a ſhare. They are in the nature of the houſe of lords, or upper houſe; but you ſeem to take the whole power in your hands, and ſet up for every thing. You have ſet a long time, to little purpoſe, and have been a great charge to the country. Ten ſhillings a day is a large allowance, and you punctually exact it. You have been always forward enough to pull down the fees of other miniſters in the government.

            <p>The violence of this man's temper is very evident in all his ſpeeches and meſſages to the aſſembly; and it can only be attributed to the ignorance of the times, that the members of that houſe, inſtead of aſſerting their equality, peaceably put up with his rudeneſs. Certainly they deſerved better uſage at his hands. For the revenue, eſtabliſhed the laſt year, was, at this ſeſſion, continued five years longer than was originally intended. This was rendering the governor for a time independent of the people. For, at that day, the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly had no treaſure; but the amount of all taxes went of courſe into the hands of the receiver-general, who was appointed by the crown. Out of this fund, monies were only iſſuable by the governor's warrant; ſo that every officer in the government, from mr. Blaithwait, who drew annually five per cent, out of the revenue, as auditor-general, down to the meaneſt ſervant of the public, became dependent, ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of the governor. And hence we find the houſe, at the cloſe

               </gap> was, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſo much diſpleaſed with them, that, ſoon after the prorogation, he diſſolved the aſſembly.</p>
            <p>The members of the new aſſembly met, according to the writ of ſummons, in March 1694, and choſe colonel Peirſon, for their ſpeaker, mr. Graham being left out at the election for the city. The ſhortneſs of this ſeſſion, which continued only to the latter end of the month, was owing to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable buſineſs the houſe began upon, of examining the ſtate of the public accounts, and in particular the muſter rolls of the volunteers, in the pay of the province. They, however, reſumed it again in September, and formally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered their diſſatisfaction, with the receiver-general's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts. The governor, at the ſame time, blew up the coals of contention, by a demand of additional pay, for the king's ſoldiers, then juſt arrived, and new ſupplies for detachments in defence of the frontiers. He at laſt prorogued them, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter obtaining an act for ſupporting one hundred men upon the borders. The ſame diſputes revived again in the ſpring 1695; and proceeded to ſuch lengths, that the aſſembly aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the governor's leave to print their minutes, that they might appeal to the public. It was at this ſeſſion, on the 12th of April 1695, that upon a petition of five church wardens and veſtrymen of the city of New-York, the houſe declared it to be their opinion, "That the veſtrymen and church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardens have power to call a diſſenting proteſtant minſter, and that he is to be paid and maintained as the act directs." The intent of this petition was to refute an opinion, which prevailed, that the late miniſtry act was made for the ſole benefit of epiſcopal clergymen.</p>
            <p>The quiet, undiſturbed ſtate of the frontiers, while the French were endeavouring to make a peace with the five na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the complaints of many of the volunteers, who had not received their pay, very much conduced to the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs of the aſſembly, in anſwering Fletcher's perpetual demands of money. But when the Indians refuſed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the terms of peace demanded by the French go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, which were to ſuffer him to rebuild the fort at Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daraqui, and to include the Indian allies, the war broke out afreſh, and the aſſembly were obliged to augment both their detachments and ſupplies. The count Frontenac now le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled his wrath, principally againſt the Mohawks, who were more attached, than any other of the five nations, to our intereſt: but as his intentions had taken air, he pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendy changed his meaſures, and ſent a party of three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men, to the iſthmus at Niagara, to ſurpriſe thoſe of
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:024800_0097_0FCD638613593388"/>the five nations, that might be hunting there. Among a few that were met with, ſome were killed, and others taken priſoners, and afterwards burnt at Montreal. Our Indians imitated the count's example, and burnt ten Dewagunga captives.</p>
            <p>Colonel Fletcher and his aſſembly having come to an open rupture in the ſpring, he called another in June, of which James Graham was choſen ſpeaker. The count Frontenac was then repairing the old fort at Cada<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>As a number of forces were now arrived the aſſembly were in hopes, the province would be relieved from raiſing any more men for the defence of the frontiers; and, to obtain this favour of the governor, ordered £ 1000. to be levied, one half to be preſented to him, and the reſt he had leave to diſtribute among the Engliſh officers and ſoldiers.

In September, Fletcher went up to Albany, with very conſiderable preſents to the Indians; whom he blamed for ſuffering the French to rebuild the fort at Cadaraqui, or Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenac, which commands the entrance from Canada, into the great lake Ontario.</p>
            <p>While theſe works were carrying on, the Dionandadies, who were then poorly ſupplied by the French, made over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of a peace with the five nations, which the latter readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embraced, becauſe it was owing to their fears of theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, who lived near the lake Miſſilimachinac, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dared to march with their whole ſtrength againſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada. The French commandant was fully ſenſible of the importance of preventing this alliance. The civilities of the Dionandadies to the priſoners, by whom the treaty, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a diſcovery, was negociated, gave the officer the firſt ſuſpicion of it. One of theſe wretches had the unhappineſs to fall into the hands of the French, who put him to the moſt exquiſite torments, that all future intercourſe with the Dionandadies might be cut off. Dr. Colden, in juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment for this inhuman barbarity, has publiſhed the whole proceſs from la Potherie's hiſtory of North America, and it is this:</p>
            <p>"The priſoner being firſt made faſt to a ſtake, ſo as to have room to move round it; a Frenchman began the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid tragedy, by broiling the fleſh of the priſoner's legs, from his toes to his knees, with the red-hot barrel of a gun. His example was followed by an Utawawa, who, being deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to out do the French in their refined cruelty, ſplit a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row from the priſoner's ſhoulder to his garter, and filling it with gun-powder, ſet fire to it. This gave him exquiſite pain, and raiſed exceſſive laughter in his tormentors. When they found his throat ſo much parched, that he was no longer able to gratify their ears with his howling, they gave him water, to enable him to continue their pleaſure longer. But at laſt, his ſtrength failing, an Utawawa fleated off his ſcalp, and threw burning hot coals on his ſcull. Then they untied him, and bid him run for his life. He began to run, tumbling like a drunken man. They ſhut up the way to the eaſt, and made him run weſtward, the country, as they think, of departed miſerable fouls. He had ſtill force left to throw ſtones, till they put an end to his miſery by knocking him on the head. After this every one cut a ſlice from his body, to conclude the tragedy with a feaſt."</p>
            <p>From the time colonel Fletcher received his inſtruction, reſpecting the quotas of theſe colonies, for the defence of the frontiers, he repeatedly, but in vain, urged their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the king's direction: he then carried his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:024800_0099_0FCD63214D2B1418"/>againſt them home to his majeſty, but all his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications were defeated by the agents of thoſe colonies, who reſided in England. As ſoon, therefore, as he had laid this matter before the aſſembly, in autumn 1695, the houſe appointed William Nicol, to go home in the quality of an agent for this province, for which they allowed him £ 1000. But his ſolicitations proved unſucceſsful, and the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, relating to theſe quotas, which is ſtill continued, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains unnoticed to this day. Fletcher maintained a good correſpondence with the aſſembly, through the reſt of his adminiſtration: and nothing appears, upon their journals, worth the reader's attention.</p>
            <p>The French never had a governor, in Canada, ſo vigilant and active as the count de Frontenac. He had no ſooner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired the old fort, called by his name, than he formed a deſign of invading the country of the five nations with a great army. For this purpoſe, in 1696, he convened at Montreal, all the regulars, as well as militia, under his command; the Owenagungas, Quatoghies of Loretto, Adi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rondacks, Sokakies, Nipiciriniens, the proſelyted praying Indians of the five nations, and a few Utawawas. Inſtead of waggons and horſes, which are uſeleſs in ſuch a country, as he had to march through, the army was conveyed, through rivers and lakes, in light barks, which are porta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, whenever the rapidity of the ſtream and the croſſing an iſthmus rendered it neceſſary. The count left la Chine, at the ſouth end of the iſland of Montreal, on the 7th of July. Two battalions of regulars, under the command of le Chevalier de Callieres, headed by a number of Indians, led the van, with two ſmall pieces of cannon, the mortars, grenadoes, and ammunition. After them followed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions; then the main body, with the count's houſehold, a conſiderable number of volunteers, and the engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer; and four battalions of the militia commanded by monſieur de Ramezai, governor of Trois Rivieres.</p>
            <p>Two battalions of regulars and a few Indians, under the chevalier de Vaudrueil, brought up the rear. Before the army went a parcel of ſcouts, to deſcry the tracks and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſcades of the enemy. After twelve days march, they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at Cadaraqui, about one hundred and eighty miles from Montreal, and then croſſed the lake to Oſwego. Fifty men marched on each ſide of the Onondaga river, which is narrow and rapid.

As ſoon as the count heard of this, he marched to their huts in order of battle; being himſelf carried in an elbow chair, behind the artillery. With this mighty apparatus he entered it, and the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a little Indian corn was the great acquiſition. A brave ſachem, then about a hundred years old, was the only perſon who tarried in the caſtle to ſalute the old ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. The French Indians put him to torment, which he endured with aſtoniſhing preſence of mind. To one who ſtabbed him with a knife, "you had better," ſays he," "make me die by fire, that theſe French dogs may learn how to ſuffer like men: you Indians, their allies, you dogs of dogs, think of me when you are in the like condition<note n="*" place="bottom">"Never perhaps (ſays Charle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This ſachem was the only man, of all the Onondagas, that was killed; and had not thirty-five Oneydoes, who waited to receive Vaud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As ſoon as he began his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, the Onondagas followed, and annoyed his army by cutting off ſeveral batteaus.</p>
            <p>This expenſive enterpriſe, and the continual incurſions of the five nations, on the country near Montreal, again ſpread a famine through all Canada. The count, however, kept up his ſpi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Mr. Livingſton then propoſed a private adventure againſt the pirates, offering to be concerned with Kid, a fifth part in the ſhip and charges, and to be bound for Kid's faithful execution of the commiſſion. The king then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of the deſign, and reſerved a tenth ſhare, to ſhow that he was concerned in the enterpriſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Lord chancellor Somers, the duke of Shrewſbury, the earls of Romu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y and Oxford, ſir Edmond Harriſon and others, joined in the ſcheme, agreeing to the expenſe of 6000<abbr>l.</abbr> But the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole affair was left to lord Bellamont, who gave orders to Kid to purſue his commiſſion, which was in common form. Kid ſailed, from Plymouth, for New-York, in April, 1696; and afterwards turned pirate, burnt his ſhip, and came to Boſton, where the earl apprehended him. His lordſhip wrote to the ſecretary of ſtate, deſiring that Kid might be ſent for. The Rocheſter man of war was diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon this ſervice; but being driven back, a general ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion prevailed in England, that all was colluſion between the miniſtry and the adventurers, who, it was thought, were unwilling Kid ſhould be brought home, leſt he might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover that the chancellor, the duke, and others, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates in the piracy. The matter even proceeded to ſuch lengths, that a motion was made, in the houſe of commons, that all who were concerned in the adventure, might be turned out of their employments; but it was rejected by a great majority.</p>
            <p>The tory party, who excited theſe clamours, though they loſt their motion in the houſe, afterwards impeached ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral whig lords; and, among other articles, charged them with being concerned in Kid's piracy. But theſe proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſerved only to brighten the innocency of thoſe, againſt whom they were brought; for the impeached lords were honourably acquitted by their peers.</p>
            <p>Lord Bellamont's commiſſion was publiſhed in council, on the day of his arrival; colonel Fletcher, who ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained governor under the proprietors of Pennſylvania, and lieutenant governor Nanfan, being preſent. The mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the council were,

            <p>After the earl had diſpatched captain John Schuyler, and Dellius, the Dutch miniſter of Albany, to Canada, with the account of the peace, and to ſolicit a mutual exchange of
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:024800_0103_0FCD632A53A3C178"/>priſoners; he laid before the council the letters from ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Vernon and the Eaſt-India company, relating to the pirates; informing that board, that he had an affidavit, that Fletcher had permitted them to land their ſpoils in this province, and that mr. Nic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> bargained for their protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and received for his ſervices 800 Spaniſh dollars. Nicoll confeſſed the receipt of the money for protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but ſaid it was in virtue of a late act of aſſembly, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing privateers on their giving ſecurity; but he denied the receipt of any money from known pirates. One Weaver was admitted, at this time, into the council-chamber, and acted in the quality of king's council, and in anſwer to mr. Nicoll, denied that there was any ſuch act of aſſembly as he mentioned. After conſidering the whole matter, the council adviſed his excellency to ſend Fletcher home, but to try Nicoll here, becauſe his eſtate would not bear the expenſe of a trial in England. Their advice was never carried into execution, which was probably owing to a want of evidence againſt the parties accuſed. It is nevertheleſs certain, that the pirates were frequently in the ſound, and ſupplied with proviſions by the inhabitants of Long Iſland, who, for many years afterwards, were ſo infatuated with a notion, that the pirates buried great quantities of money along the coaſt, that there is ſcarce a point of land, or an iſland without the marks of their <hi>auri ſacra fames.</hi> Some credulous people have ruined themſelves by theſe reſearches, and propagated a thouſand idie fables current to this day, among our country farmers.</p>
            <p>As Fletcher, through the whole of his adminiſtration, had been entirely influenced by the enemies of Leiſler; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be more agreeable to the numerous adherents of that unhappy man, than the earl's diſaffection to the late governor. It was for this reaſon, they immediately devoted themſelves to his lordſhip, as the head of their party.</p>
            <p>The majority of the members of the council were Fletch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's friends; and there needed nothing more to render them obnoxious to his lordſhip. Leiſler's advocates, at the ſame time, mortally hated them; not only becauſe they had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brued their hands in the blood of the principal men of their party, but alſo becauſe they had engroſſed the ſole confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the late governor, and brought down his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon them. Hence, at the commencement of the earl's adminiſtration, the members of the council had every thing to fear; while the party they had depreſſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan once again to erect its head under the ſmiles of a gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, who was fond of their aid, as they were ſolicitous to conciliate his favour. Had the earl countenanced the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as well as the friends of Leiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>er, which he might have done, his adminiſtration would doubtleſs have been eaſier
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:024800_0104_0FCD632BCE4B4D40"/>to himſelf and advantageous to the province. But his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible averſion to Fletcher prevented his acting with that moderation, which was neceſſary to enable him to govern both parties.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ve the fulleſt evidence of his abhorrence of the late ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration. Philip French was choſen ſpeaker, and waited upon his excellency with the houſe, when his lordſhip ſpoke to them in the following manner:</p>
            <p>"I cannot but obſerve to you, what a legacy my prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor has left me, and what difficulties to ſtruggle with; a divided people, an empty purſe, a few miſerable, naked, half-ſtarved ſoldiers, not half the number the king allowed pay for: the fortifications and even the governor's houſe very much out of repair, and, in a word, the whole go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment out of frame. It hath been repreſented to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in England, that this province has been a noted receptacle of pirates, and the trade of it under no reſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but the acts of trade violated by the neglect and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance of thoſe, whoſe duty it was to have prevented it."</p>
            <p>After this introduction, he puts them in mind that the revenue was near expiring. "It would be hard, ſays he, if I that come among you with an honeſt mind, and a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to be juſt to your intereſt, ſhould meet with greater difficulties, in the diſcharge of his majeſty's ſervice, than thoſe that have gone before me. I will take care there ſhall be no miſapplication of the public money. I will pocket none of it myſelf, nor ſhall there be any embezzlement by o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hers; but exact accounts ſhall be given you, when, and as often as you ſhall require."</p>
            <p>It was cuſtomary with Fletcher, to be preſent in the field, to influence elections; and as the aſſembly conſiſted, at this time, of but nineteen members, they were too eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly influenced to ſerve the private ends of a faction. For that reaſon, his lordſhip was warm in a ſcheme of increaſing their number, at preſent, to thirty, and ſo, in proportion, as the colony became more populous; and hence we find the following clauſe in his ſpeech. "You cannot but know, what abuſes have been formerly in elections of members, to ſerve in the general aſſembly, which tends to the ſubverſion of your liberties. I do therefore recommend the making of a law to provide againſt it."</p>
            <p>The houſe, though unanimous in a hearty addreſs of thanks to the governor for his ſpeech, could ſcarce agree
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:024800_0105_0FCD632D5331D568"/>upon any thing elſe. It was not till the beginning of June, before they had finiſhed the controverſies relating to the late turbulent elections; and even then ſix members ſeceded from the houſe, which obliged his excellency to diſſolve the aſſembly on the 14th of June, 1693. About the ſame time, the governor diſmiſſed two of the council; Pinhorne, for diſreſpectful words of the king, and Brook, the receiver-general, who was alſo turned out of that office, as well as removed from his place on the bench.</p>
            <p>In July, the diſputes with the French, concerning the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing of priſoners, obliged his excellency to go up to Albany. When the earl ſent the account of the concluſion of the peace to the governor of Canada, all the French pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, in our cuſtody, were reſtored, and as to thoſe among the Indians, he promiſed to order them to be ſafely eſcort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Montreal. His lordſhip then added, "I doubt not, ſir, that you; on your part, will alſo iſſue an order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the ſubjects of the king, captivated during the war, whether chriſtians or Indians."</p>
            <p>The count, fearful of being drawn into an implicit ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, that the five nations were ſubject to the Engliſh crown, demanded the French priſoners, among the Indians, to be brought to Montreal; threatening, at the ſame time, to continue the war againſt the confederates, if they did not comply with his requeſt. After the earl's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview with them, he wrote a ſecond letter<note n="*" place="bottom">Charlevoix has publiſhed both theſe letters, at large, together with count Frontenac's anſwer. I have had no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of enquiring into the jeſuit's integrity, in theſe tranſcripts, being unable to find his lordſhip's letters in the ſecretary's office.</note> to the count, informing him that they had importunately begged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue under the protection of the Engliſh crown, profeſſing an inviolable ſubjection and fidelity to his majeſty; and that the five nations were always conſidered as ſubjects, which, ſays his lordſhip, "can be manifeſted to all the world by authentic and ſolid proofs." His lordſhip added, that he would not ſuffer them to be inſulted, and threatened to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the laws of England upon the miſſionaries, if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued any longer in the five cantons. A reſolute ſpirit runs through the whole letter, which concludes in theſe words: "if it is neceſſary, I will arm every man in the provinces, under my government, to oppoſe you; and redreſs the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury that you may perpetrate againſt our Indians." The
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:024800_0106_0FCD633233B8F398"/>count, in his anſwer, propoſed to refer the diſpute to the commiſſaries, to be appointed according to the treaty of Ryſwick<note n="†" place="bottom">The count miſunderſtood the treaty. No proviſion was made by it for commiſſaries to ſettle the limits between the Engliſh and French poſſeſſions, but only to examine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the controverted rights and pretenſions to Hudſon's Bay.</note> but the earl continued the claim, inſiſting that the French priſoners ſhould be delivered up at Albany.</p>
            <p>The French count dying while this matter was contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, monſieur de Callieres, his ſucceſſor, ſent ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, the next year, to Onondaga, there to regulate the exchange of priſoners, which was accompliſhed without the earl's conſent; and thus the important point, in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, remained unſettled. The jeſuit Bruyas, who was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this embaſſage, offered to live at Onondaga; but the Indians ref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſed his belt, ſaying that Corlear, or the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of New-York, had already offered them miniſters for their inſtruction.</p>
            <p>Great alterations were made in council, at his excellency is return from Albany. Bayard, Mienvielle, Willet, Townly, and Lawrence, were all ſuſpended on the 28th of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and colonel Abraham Depeyſter, Robert Livingſton, and Samuel Staats, called to that board. The next day, Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick Philipſe reſigned his ſeat, and Robert Walters was ſworn in his ſtead.</p>
            <p>The new aſſembly, of which James Graham was choſen ſpeaker, met in the ſpring. His excellency ſpoke to them on the 21ſt of March, 1699.</p>
            <p>As the late aſſembly was principally compoſed of Anti-Leiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erians, ſo this conſiſted, almoſt entirely, of the oppoſite party. The elections were attended with great outrage and tumult, and many applications made, relating to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns; but as Abraham Governeur, who had been ſecretary to Leiſler, got returned for Orange county, and was very active in the houſe<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Governeur married Miſborne's widow.</note>, all the petitions were rejected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceremony.</p>
            <p>Among the principal acts, paſſed at this ſeſſion, there was one for indemnifying thoſe who were excepted out of the general pardon in 1691; another againſt pirates; one for the ſettlement of Milborne's eſtate; and another to raiſe fifteen hundred pounds, as a preſent to his lordſhip, and five hundred pounds for the lieutenant-governor, his
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:024800_0107_0FCD632FF45166F0"/>kinſman. Beſides which, the revenue was continued for ſix years longer. A neceſſary law was alſo made for the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of elections, containing the ſubſtance of the Engliſh ſtatutes of 8 Hen. VI. chap. VII. and the 7 and 8 Will. III.</p>
            <p>This aſſembly took, alſo, into conſideration ſundry ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant grants of land, which colonel Fletcher had made to ſeveral of his favourites. Among theſe, two grants to Delli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, the Dutch miniſter, and one to Nicholas Bayard, were the moſt conſiderable. Dellius was one of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners for Indian affairs, and had fradulently obtained the Indian deeds, according to which the patents had been granted. One of the grants included all the lands within twelve miles on the caſt ſide of Hudſon's river, and extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed twenty miles in length, from the north bounds of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raghtoga. The ſecond patent, which was granted to him in company with Pinhorne, Bancker, and others, contained all the lands, within two miles on each ſide of the Mohawks river, and along its banks to the extent of fifty miles, Bayard's grant was alſo for lands in that country, and very extravagant. Lord Bellamont, who juſtly thought theſe great patents, with the trifling annual reſervation of a few ſkins, would impede the ſettlement of the country, as well as alienate the affections of our Indian allies, wifely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured recommendatory inſtructions from the lords juſtices, for vacating thoſe patents, which was now regularly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed by a law, and Dellius thereby ſuſpended from his miniſterial function.</p>
            <p>The earl having thus carried all his points at New-York, ſet out for Boſton in June, where, after he had ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled his ſalary, and apprehended the pirate Kidd, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned here again in the fall.</p>
            <p>The revenue being ſettled for ſix years, his lordſhip had no occaſion to meet the aſſembly till the ſummer of the year 1700, and then indeed little elſe was done, than to paſs a few laws. One for hanging every popiſh prieſt that came volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily into the province, which was occaſioned by the great number of French jeſuits, who were continually practiſing upon our Indians. By another, proviſion was made for erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a fort in the country of the Onondagas; but as this was repealed a few months after the king's providing for that purpoſe, ſo the former continues, as it forever ought, in full force to this day.</p>
            <p>The earl was a man of art and polite manners, and being a mortal enemy to the French, as well as a lover of liberty,
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:024800_0108_0FCD6333DAFFAEA0"/>he would doubtleſs have been of conſiderable ſervice to the colony; but he died here on the 5th of March in 1701, when he was but juſt become acquainted with the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony.</p>
            <p>The earl of Bellamont's death was the ſource of new troubles; for Nanfan, the lieutenant-governor, being then abſent in Barbadoes, high diſputes aroſe among the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, concerning the exerciſe of the powers of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Abraham de Peyſter, Samuel Staats, Robert Walters, and Thomas Weaver, who ſided with the party that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to Leiſler, inſiſted that the government was devolved upon the council, who had a right to act by a majority of voices; but colonel Smith contended that all the powers of the late governor were devolved upon him, as preſident, he being the eldeſt member of that board. Colonel Schuyler and Robert Livingſton, who did not arrive in town till the 21ſt of March, joined mr. Smith, and refuſed to appear at the council-board, till near the middle of April. The aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, which was convened on the 2d of that month, were in equal perplexity; for they adjourned from day to day, waiting the iſſue of this rupture. Both parties continuing inflexible, thoſe members, who oppoſed colonel Smith, ſent down to the houſe a repreſentation of the controverſy, aſſigning a number of reaſons for the ſitting of the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, which the houſe took into their conſideration, and on the 16th of April reſolved, that the execution of the earl's commiſſion and inſtructions, in the abſence of the lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-governor, was the right of the council by majority of voices, and not of any ſingle member of that board; and this was afterwards the opinion of the lords of trade. The diſputes, nevertheleſs, continuing in the council, ſtrenuouſly ſupported by mr. Livingſton, the houſe, on the 19th of April, thought proper to adjourn themſelves to the firſt Tueſday in June.</p>
            <p>In this interval, on the 19th of May, John Nanfan, the lieutenant-governor, arrived, and ſettled the controverſy, by taking upon himſelf the ſupreme command.</p>
            <p>Upon mr. Nanfan's arrival, we had the agreeable news, that the king had given two thouſand pounds ſterling, for the defence of Albany and Schenectady, as well as five hundred pounds more for erecting a fort in the country of the Onondagas. And not long after an ordinance was iſſued, agreeable to the ſpecial direction of the lords of trade, for erecting a court of chancery, to ſit the firſt Thurſday in every month. By this ordinance the powers of the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celor
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:024800_0109_0FCD6334D0BC0AD8"/>were veſted in the governor and council, or any two of that board: commiſſions were alſo granted, appointing maſters, clerks, and a regiſter: ſo that this court was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely organized on the 2d of September, 1701.</p>
            <p>Atwood, who was then chief juſtice or the ſupreme court, was now ſworn of the council. Abraham de Peyſter, and Robert Walters were his aſſiſtants on the bench; and the former was alſo made deputy auditor-general, under mr. Elaithwait. Sampſon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>helton Broughton was the attorney-general, and came into that office when Atwood took his ſeat on the bench, before the deceaſe of lord Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamont. Both theſe had their commiſſions from England. The lieutenant-governor, and the major part of the board of council, together with the ſeveral officers above named, being ſtrongly in the intereſt of the Leiſlerian party, it was not a little ſurpriſing, that mr. Nanfan diſſolved the late aſſembly on the 1ſt of June laſt.</p>
            <p>Great were the ſtruggles at the enſuing elections, which, however, generally prevailed in ſavour of thoſe who joined Leiſler at the revolution; and hence, when the new aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly met on the 19th of Auguſt 1701, Abraham Governeur was elected for their ſpeaker. Dutcheſs was thought here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore incapable of bearing the charge of a repreſentation; but the people of that county, now animated by the heat of the times, ſent Jacob Rutſen and Adrian Garretſen to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent them in aſſembly.</p>
            <p>Mr. Nanfan, in his ſpeech to the houſe, informs them of the memorable grant made to the crown, on the 19th of July, by the five nations, of a vaſt tract of land, to prevent the neceſſity of their ſubmitting to the French in caſe of a war; and that his majeſty had given out of his exchequer two thouſand five hundred pounds ſterling, for forts, and eight hundred pounds to be laid out in preſents to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians; and that he had alſo ſettled a ſalary of three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds on a chief juſtice, and one hundred and fifty pounds on the attorney-general, who were both now arrived here.</p>
            <p>The fire of contention, which had lately appeared in the tumultuous elections, blazed out afreſh in the houſe, Nicoll, the late counſellor, got himſelf elected for Suffolk, and was in hopes of being ſeated in the chair: but Abraham Governeur was choſen ſpeaker. Several members contended, that he, being an alien, was unqualified for that ſtation. To this it was anſwered, that he was in the province in the year 1683, at the time of paſſing an act to naturalize all the free inhabitants, profeſſing the chriſtian religion; and that
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:024800_0110_0FCD6336F73719F0"/>for this reaſon, the ſame objection againſt him had benn-over-ruled at the laſt aſſembly. In return for this attack, Governeur diſputed Nicoll's right of ſitting as a member of that houſe; and ſucceeded in a reſolve, that he and mr. Weſſels, who had been returned for Albany, were both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified according to the late act, they being neither of them reſidents in the reſpective counties for which they were citoſen: This occaſioned an imprudent ſeceſſion of ſeven members, who had joined the intereſt of mr. Nicoll; which gave their adverſaries an opportunity to expel them, and introduce others in their ſtead.</p>
            <p>Among the firſt oppoſers of captain Leiſler, none was more conſiderable than mr. Livingſton. The meaſures of the convention at Albany were very much directed by his advice; and he was peculiarly obnoxious to his adverſaries, becauſe he was a man of ſenſe and reſolution, two qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations rarely to be found united in one perſon at that day. Mr. Livingſton's intimacy with the late earl, had till this time, been his defence, againſt the rage of the party which he had formerly oppoſed: but as that lord was now dead, and mr. Livingſton's conduct in council, in favour of colonel Smith, had given freſh provocation to his enemies, they were fully bent upon his deſtruction. It was in execution of this ſcheme, that as ſoon as the diſputed elections were over, the houſe proceeded to examine the ſtate of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic accounts, which they partly began at the late aſſembly.</p>
            <p>The pretence was, that he refuſed to account for the public monies, he had formerly received out of the exciſe; upon which, a committee of both houſes adviſed the paſſing a bill to confiſcate his eſtate, unleſs he agreed to account by a certain day. But inſtead of this, an act was afterwards paſſed to oblige him to account for a ſum amounting to near eighteen thouſand pounds. While this matter was tranſacting, a new complaint was forged, and he was ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned before another committee of both houſes, relating to his procuring the five nations to ſignify their deſire that he ſhould be ſent home to ſolicit their affairs. The crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality of this charge can be ſeen only through the partial optics, with which his enemies then ſcanned his behaviour. Beſides, there was no evidence to ſupport it, and therefore the committee required him to purge himſelf by his own oath. Mr. Livingſton, who was better acquainted with Engliſh law and liberty, than to countenance a practice ſo odious, rejected the inſolent demand with diſdain; upon which the houſe, by advice of the committee, addreſſed the lieutenant-governor, to pray his majeſty to remove
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:024800_0111_0FCD6337E85BF090"/>him from his office of ſecretary of Indian affairs, and that the governor, in the mean time, would ſuſpend him from the exerciſe of his commiſſion<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Livingſton's reaſon for not accounting was truly unanſwerable; his books and vouchers were taken into the hands of the government, and detained from him.</note>.</p>
            <p>It was at this favourable conjuncture, that Jacob Leiſler's petition to the king, and his majeſty's letter to the late ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>l of Bellamont, were laid before the aſſembly. Leiſter, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with the report of the lords of trade, that his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and his brother Milborne had ſuffered according to law, laid his caſe before the parliament, and obtained an act to reverſe the attainder. After which, he applied to the king, complaining that his father had diſburſed about four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds, in purchaſing arms, and forwarding the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution; in conſequence of which he procured the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing letter to lord Bellamont, dated at Whitehall the 6th of February 1699/1700.</p>

            <p>As ſoon as this letter and the petition were brought into the houſe, a thouſand pounds were ordered to be levied for the benefit of mr. Leiſler, as well as ſeveral ſums for other perſons, by a bill for paying the debts of the government; which, nevertheleſs, did not paſs into a law, till the next ſeſſions. Every thing that was done at this meeting of the aſſembly, which continued till the 18th of October, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the influence of a party ſpirit; and nothing can be a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler evidence of it, than an incorrect, impertinent addreſs to his majeſty, which was drawn up by the houſe, at the cloſe of the ſeſſion, and ſigned by fourteen of the members. It contains a tedious narrative of their proceedings, relating
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:024800_0112_0FCD63396D4BB018"/>to the diſputed elections, and concludes with a little incenſe, to regale ſome of the then principal agents in the public affairs, in theſe words:</p>
            <p>"This neceſſary account of ourſelves and our unhappy diviſions, which we hope the moderation of our lieutenant-governor, the wiſdom and prudence of William Atwood, <abbr>eſq</abbr> our chief juſtice, and Thomas Weaver, <abbr>eſq</abbr> your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's collector and receiver-general, might have healed, we lay before your majeſty with all humility, and deep ſenſe of your majeſty's goodneſs to us, lately expreſſed in ſending over ſo excellent a perſon to be our chief juſtice."</p>
            <p>The news of the king's having appointed lord Cornbury to ſucceed the earl of Bellamont, ſo ſtrongly animated the hopes of the Anti-Leiſlerian party, that about the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of the year 1702, Nicholas Bayard promoted ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral addreſſes to the king, the parliament, and lord Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, which were ſubſcribed at a tavern kept by one Hutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins, an alderman of the city of New-York. In that to his majeſty, they aſſure him, "That the late differences were not grounded on a regard to his intereſt, but the corrupt deſigns of thoſe, who laid hold on an opportunity to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich themſelves by the ſpoils of their neighbours." The petition to the parliament ſays, that Leiſler and his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents gained the fort at the revolution without any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; that he oppreſſed and impriſoned the people without cauſe, plundered them of their goods, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled them to f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee their country, though they were well affected to the prince of Orange. That the earl of Bella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont appointed indigent ſheriffs, who returned ſuch mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to the aſſembly as were unduly elected, and in his lordſhip's eſteem. That he ſuſpended many from the board of council, who were faithful ſervants to the crown, introducing his own tools in their ſtead. Nay they denied the authority of the late aſſembly, and added, that the houſe had bribed both the lieutenant-governor and the chief juſtice; the one to paſs their bills, and the other to defend the legality of their proceedings. A third addreſs was prepared, to be preſented to lord Cornbury, to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate his arrival, as well to prepoſſeſs him in their favour, as to prejudice him againſt the oppoſite party.</p>
            <p>Nothing could have a more natural tendency to excite the wrath of the lieutenant governor, and the revenge of the council and aſſembly, than the reflexions contained in thoſe ſeveral addreſſes. Nanfan had no ſooner received intelligence of them, than he ſummoned Hutchins to deliver them up to
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:024800_0113_0FCD633B1C2D5930"/>him, and upon his refuſal committed him to jail, on the 19th of January. The next day Nicholas Bayard, Rip Van Dam, Philip French, and Thomas Wenham, hot with party zeal, ſent an imprudent addreſs to the lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-governor, boldly juſtifying the legality of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, and demanding his diſcharge out of cuſtody. I have before taken notice, that upon Sloughter's arrival in 1691, an act was paſſed, to recognize the right of king William and queen Mary to the ſovereignty of this province. At the end of that law, a clauſe was added in theſe words, "That whatſoever perſon or perſons ſhall by any manner of ways, or upon any pretence whatſoever, endeavour by force of arms or otherwiſe, to diſturb the peace, good, and quiet of their majeſties' government, as it is now eſtabliſhed, ſhall be deemed and eſteemed as rebels and traitors unto their majeſties, and in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ur the pains, penalties, and forfeitures, as the laws of England have for ſuch offences made and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided." Under pretext of this law, which Bayard himſelf had been perſonally concerned in enacting, mr. Nanfan iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued a warrant for committing him to jail as a traitor, on the 21ſt of January; and leſt the mob ſhould interpoſe, a company of ſoldiers for a week after, conſtantly guarded the priſon.</p>
            <p>Through the uncertainty of the time of lord Cornbury's arrival, mr. Nanfan choſe to bring the priſoner to his trial, as ſoon as poſſible; and for that purpoſe iſſued a commiſſion of oyer and terminer, on the 12th of February, to William Atwood, the chief juſtice, and Abraham De Peyſter and Robert Walters, who were the puiſne judges of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme court; and not long after Bayard was arraigned, indicted, tried, and convicted of high treaſon. Several reaſons were afterwards offered in arreſt of judgment; but as the priſoner was unfortunately in the hands of an enraged party, Atwood over-ruled what was offered, and condemned him to death on the 16th of March. As the proceſs of his trial has been long ſince printed in the ſtate trials at large, I leave the reader to his own remarks upon the conduct of the judges, who are generally accuſed of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality.</p>
            <p>Bayard applied to mr. Nanfan for a reprieve, till his majeſty's pleaſure might be known; and obtained it, not without great difficulty, nor till after a ſeeming confeſſion of guilt was extorted. Hutchins, who was alſo convicted, was bailed upon the payment of forty pieces of eight to the ſheriff: but Bayard, who refuſed to procure him the gift of a farm, of about fifteen hundred pounds value, was not releaſed from his confinement, till after the arrival of
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:024800_0114_0FCD633DB97A4390"/>lord Cornbury, who not only gave his conſent to an act for reverſing the late attainders, but procured the queen's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of it, upon their giving ſecurity, according to the advice of ſir Edward Northey, not to bring any ſuits againſt thoſe who were concerned in their proſecution; which the attorney-general thought proper, as the act ordained all the proceedings to be obliterated.</p>
            <p>After theſe trials, Nanfan erected a court of exchequer, and again convened the aſſembly, who thanked him for his late meaſures, and paſſed an act to out-law Philip French, and Thomas Wenham, who abſconded upon Bayard's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment; another to augment the number of repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and ſeveral others, which were, all but one, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards repealed by queen Anne. During this ſeſſion, lord Cornbury being daily expected, the lieutenant-governor ſuſpended mr. Livingſton from his ſeat in council, and thus continued to abet Leiſler's party, to the end of his admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</p>
            <p>Lord Cornbury's arrival quite opened a new ſcene. His father, the earl of Clarendon, adhered to the cauſe of the late abdicated king, and always refuſed the oaths both to king William and queen Anne. But the ſon recommended himſelf at the revolution, by appearing very early for the prince of Orange, being one of the firſt officers that deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed king James's army. King William, in gratitude for his ſervices, gave him a commiſſion for this government, which upon the death of the king, was renewed by queen Anne, who at the ſame time, appointed him to the chief command of New-Jerſey, the government of which the proprietors had lately ſurrendered into her hands. As lord Cornbury came to this province, in very indigent circumſtances, hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of England by a hoſt of hungry creditors, he was bent upon getting as much money, as he could ſqueeze out of the purſes of an impoveriſhed people. His talents were, perhaps, not ſuperior to the moſt inconſiderable of his predeceſſors; but in his zeal for the church he was ſurpaſſed by none. With theſe bright qualifications he began his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration on the 3d of May, 1702, aſſiſted by a council conſiſting of the following members:

                  <item>William Smith,</item>

                  <item>Rip Van Dam.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>His lordſhip, without the leaſt diſguiſe, eſpouſing the
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:024800_0115_0FCD634086252690"/>Anti-Leiſlerian faction, Atwood, the chief juſtice, and Weaver, who acted in quality of ſolicitor-general, thought proper to retire from his frowns to Virginia, whence they ſailed to England: the former concealing himſelf under the name of Jones, while the latter called himſelf Jackſon. Colonel Heathcote and doctor Bridges ſucceeded in their places at the council board.</p>
            <p>The following ſummer was remarkable for an uncommon mortality, which prevailed in the city of New-York, and makes a grand epoch among our inhabitants, diſtinguiſhed by the "time of the great ſickneſs<note n="*" place="bottom">The fever killed almoſt every patient ſeized with it, and was brought here in a veſſel from St. Thomas in the Weſt Indies, an iſland remarkable for contagious diſeaſes.</note>." On this occaſion lord Cornbury had his reſidence and court at Jamaica, a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant village on Long-Iſland, diſtant about twelve miles from the city.</p>
            <p>The inhabitants of Jamaica conſiſted, at that time, partly of original Dutch planters, but moſtly of New-England emigrants, encouraged to ſettle there, after the ſurrender, by the duke of York's conditions for plantations, one of which was in theſe words: "That every townſhip ſhould be obliged to pay their own miniſters, according to ſuch agreements as they ſhould make with him; the miniſter being elected by the major part of the houſeholders and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the town." Theſe people had erected an edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the worſhip of God, and enjoyed a handſome dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a parſonage-houſe and glebe, for the uſe of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter. After the miniſtry act was paſſed, by colonel Fletcher, in 1693, a few epiſcopalians crept into the town, and view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the preſbyterian church with a jealous eye. The town vote, in virtue of which the building had been erected, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained no clauſe to prevent its being hereafter engroſſed by any other ſect. The epiſcopal party, who knew this, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a deſign of ſeizing the edifice for themſelves, which they ſhortly after carried into execution, by entering the church between the morning and evening ſervice, while the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian miniſter and his congregation were in perfect ſecurity, unſuſpicious of the zeal of their adverſaries, and a fraudulent ejectment, on a day conſecrated to ſacred reſt.</p>
            <p>Great outrage enſued among the people; for the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being <hi>pro aris &amp; focis,</hi> was animating and important. The original proprietors of the houſe tore up their ſeats,
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:024800_0116_0FCD634191714D30"/>and afterwards got the key and the poſſeſſion of the church, which were ſhortly after again taken from them by force and violence. In theſe controverſies the governor abetted the epiſcopal zealots, and harraſſed the others by numberleſs proſecutions, heavy ſines, and long impriſonments; thro' fear of which, many, who had been active in the diſpute, fled out of the province. Lord Cornbury's noble deſcent and education ſhould have prevented him from taking part in ſo ignominious a quarrel: but his lordſhip's ſenſe of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and juſtice was as weak and indelicate, as his bigotry was rampant and uncontroulable; and hence we find him guilty of an act complicated of a number of vices, which no man could have perpetrated without violence to the very ſlighteſt remains of generoſity and juſtice. When his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency retired to Jamaica, one Hubbard, the preſbyterian miniſter, lived in the beſt houſe in the town. His lordſhip begged the loan of it for the uſe of his own family; and the clergyman put himſelf to no ſmall inconvenience to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the governor's requeſt: but in return for the generous benefaction, his lordſhip perfidiouſly delivered the parſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age-houſe into the hands of the epiſcopal party, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged one Cardwel, the ſheriff, a mean fellow, who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards put an end to his own life, to ſeize upon the glebe, which he ſurveyed into lots, and farmed for the benefit of the epiſcopal church. Theſe tyrannical meaſures juſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed the indignation of the injured ſufferers, and that again the more embittered his lordſhip againſt them. They reſented, and he proſecuted; nor did he confine his pious rage to the people of Jamaica. He deteſted all who were of the ſame denomination; nay, averſe to every ſect except his own, he inſiſted that neither the miniſters nor ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters of the Dutch, the moſt numerous perſuaſion in the province, had a right to preach or inſtruct without his gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernatorial licence: and ſome of them tamely ſubmitted to his authoritative rule. A general account of his lordſhip's ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular zeal, is preſerved under the title of the Watch Tower, in a number of papers publiſhed in the New-York Weekly Mercury, for the year 1755.</p>
            <p>While his excellency was exerting his bigotry, during the ſummer ſeaſon, at Jamaica; the elections were carrying on, with great heat, for an aſſembly, which met him, at that village, in the fall. It conſiſted principally of the party which had been borne down by the earl of Bellamont and his kinſman; and hence we find Philip French, who had lately been out-lawed, was returned a repreſentative for New-York, and William Nicoll elected into the ſpeaker's
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:024800_0117_0FCD634493AEA688"/>chair. Several extracts from my lord's ſpeech are proper to be laid before the reader, as a ſpecimen of his temper and deſigns. "It was an extreme ſurpriſe to me (ſays his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip) to find this province, at my landing at New-York, in ſuch a convulſion as muſt have unavoidably occaſioned its ruin, if it had been ſuffered to go on a little longer. The many complaints that were brought to me, againſt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons I found here in power, ſufficiently proved againſt them —and the miſerable accounts I had of the condition of our frontiers—made me think it convenient to delay my meeting you in general aſſembly, till I could inform myſelf, in ſome meaſure, of the condition of this province, that I might be able to offer to your conſideration, ſome few of thoſe things, which will be neceſſary to be done forthwith, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the country."</p>
            <p>He then recommends their fortifying the port of New-York, and the frontiers; adding, that he found the ſoldiers naked and unarmed: after which he propoſes a militia bill, the erection of public ſchools, and an examination of the provincial debts and accounts; and not only promiſes to make a faithful application of the monies to be raiſed, but that he would render them an account. The whole ſpeech is ſweetened with this gracious concluſion: "Now, gentlemen, I have no more to trouble you with, but to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, in the name of the great queen of England, my miſtreſs, that you may ſafely depend upon all the protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that good and faithful ſubjects can deſire or expect, from a ſovereign whoſe greateſt delight is the welfare of her people, under whoſe auſpicious reign we are ſure to enjoy what no nation in the world dares claim but the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of England; I mean, the free enjoyment of the beſt religion in the world, the full poſſeſſion of all lawful liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the undiſturbed enjoyment of our freeholds and properties. Theſe are ſome of the many benefits which I take the inhabitants of this province to be well entitled to by the laws of England; and I am glad of this opportunity to aſſure you, that as long as I have the honour to ſerve the queen in the government of this province, thoſe laws ſhall be put in execution, according to the intent with which they were made; that is, for the preſervation and protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the people, and not for their oppreſſion. I heartily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice to ſee, that the free choice of the people has fallen upon gentlemen, whoſe conſtant fidelity to the crown, and unwearied application to the good of their country, is ſo univerſally known."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="122" facs="unknown:024800_0118_0FCD6346C1189038"/>
The houſe echoed back an addreſs of high compliment to his lordſhip, declaring, "That being deeply ſenſible of the miſery and calamity the country lay under at his arrival, they were not ſufficiently able to expreſs the ſatisfaction they had, both in their relief and their deliverer."</p>
            <p>Well pleaſed with a governor who headed their party, the aſſembly granted him all his requeſts; eighteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds were raiſed for the ſupport of one hundred and eighty men, to defend the frontiers, beſides two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds more, as a preſent, towards defraying the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes of his voyage. The queen, by her letter of the 20th of April, in the next year, forbid any ſuch donations for the future. It is obſervable, that though the county of Ducheſs had no repreſentatives at this aſſembly, yet ſuch was then the known indigence of that now populous and flouriſhing county, that but eighteen pounds were appor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned for their quota of theſe levies.</p>
            <p>Beſides the acts above-mentioned, the houſe brought up a militia bill, and continued the revenue to the 1ſt of May, 1709; and a law paſſed to eſtabliſh a grammar-ſchool, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his lordſhip's recommendation. Beſides the great harmony that ſubſiſted between the governor and his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, there was nothing remarkable, except two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves againſt the court of chancery erected by mr. Nanfan, occaſioned by a petition of ſeveral diſappointed ſuitors, who were diſpleaſed with a decree. The reſolutions were in theſe words: "That the ſetting up a court of equity in this colony, without conſent of general aſſembly, is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation without any former precedent, inconvenient and contrary to the Engliſh law." And again: "That the court of chancery, as lately erected, and managed here, was and is unwarrantable, a great oppreſſion to the ſubject, of pernicious example and conſequence; that all proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, orders, and decrees in the ſame, are, and of right ought to be, declared null and void; and that a bill be brought in, according to theſe two reſolutions," which was done: but though his lordſhip was by no means diſinclined to fix contempt on Nanfan's adminiſtration, yet, as this bill would diminiſh his own power, himſelf being the chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, the matter was never moved farther, than to the order for the engroſſment of the bill upon the ſecond reading.</p>
            <p>Though a war was proclaimed by England on the 4th of May, 1702, againſt France and Spain, yet as the five nations had entered into a treaty of neutrality with the French in Canada, this province, inſtead of being harraſſed on its
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:024800_0119_0FCD6348EA91F6E8"/>borders by the enemy, carried on a trade very advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to all thoſe who were concerned in it. The governor, however, continued his ſolicitations for money, with unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted importunity, and by alarming the aſſembly, which met in April 1703, with his expectation of an attack by ſea, fifteen hundred pounds were raiſed, under pretence of erecting two batteries at the Narrows, which, inſtead of being employed for that uſe, his lordſhip, notwithſtanding the province had expended twenty two thouſand pounds during the late peace, was pleaſed to appropriate to his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate advantage. But let us do him the juſtice to confeſs, that while he was robbing the public, he at the ſame time conſented to ſeveral other laws for the emolument of the clergy.</p>
            <p>Whether it was owing to the extraordinary ſagacity of the houſe, or their preſumption that his lordſhip was as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to be truſted as any of his predeceſſors, that, after voting the above ſum for the batteries, they added, that it ſhould be "for no other uſe whatſoever," I leave the reader to determine. It is certain they now began to ſee the danger of throwing the public money into the hands of a receiver-general, appointed by the crown, from whence the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, by his warrants, might draw it at his pleaſure. To this cauſe we muſt aſſign it, that in an addreſs to his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, on the 19th of June, 1703, they "deſire and inſiſt, that ſome proper and ſufficient perſon might be commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned treaſurer, for the receiving and paying ſuch monies now intended to be raiſed for the public uſe, as a means to obſtruct miſapplications for the future." Another addreſs was ſent home to the queen, complaining of the ill ſtate of the revenue, through the frauds which had formerly been committed, the better to facilitate the important de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of having a treaſurer dependent on the aſſembly. The ſucceſs of theſe meaſures will appear in the ſequel.</p>
            <p>Tho' our frontiers enjoyed the profoundeſt tranquillity all the next winter, and we had expended thirteen hundred pounds, in ſupporting one hundred fuzileers about Albany, beſides the four independent companies in the pay of the crown, yet his excellency demanded proviſions for one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty men, at the next meeting of the aſſembly, in April, 1704. The houſe having reaſon to ſuſpect, that the ſeveral ſums of eighteen and thirteen hundred pounds, lately raiſed for the public ſervice, had been prodigally expend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or embezzled, prudently declined any farther aids, till they were ſatisfied that no miſapplication had been made. For this purpoſe they appointed a committee, who reported.

               </gap> the colony. His lordſhip, who had hitherto been treated with great complaiſance, took offence at this parſimonious ſcrutiny, and ordered the aſſembly to attend him; when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the example of Fletcher, whom, abating that man's ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior activity, his lordſhip moſtly reſembled, he made an angry ſpeech, in which he charges them with innovations never attempted by their predeceſſors, and hopes they would not force him to exert "certain powers" veſted in him by the queen. But what he more particularly took notice of, was their inſiſting in ſeveral late bills, upon the title of "general aſſembly," and a ſaving of the "rights of the houſe," in a reſolve agreeing to an amendment for prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delay; with reſpect to which, his lordſhip has theſe words: "I know of no right that you have as an aſſembly, but ſuch as the queen is pleaſed to allow you." As to the vote, by which they found a balance due to the colony, of nine hundred and thirteen pounds, fifteen ſhillings, "it is true (ſays his lordſhip) the queen is pleaſed to command me in her inſtructions, to permit the aſſembly, from time to time, to view and examine the accounts of money, or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of money, diſpoſed by virtue of the laws made by them: but you can in no wiſe meddle with that money; but if you find any miſapplication of any of that money, you ought to acquaint me with it, that I may take care to ſee thoſe miſtakes rectified, which I ſhall certainly do."</p>
            <p>The houſe bore theſe rebukes with the utmoſt paſſiveneſs, contenting themſelves with little elſe than a general com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the deficiency of the revenue, which became the ſubject of their particular conſideration in the fall. The governor, on the one hand, then propoſed an additional duty of ten per cent. on certain goods, not immediately im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from Europe, to which the aſſembly, on the other, were utterly averſe, and as ſoon as they reſolved againſt it, the very printer, clerk, and door-keeper, were denied the payment of their ſalaries. Several other demands being made for the public debts, the houſe reſolved to addreſs his lordſhip for an exact account of the revenue, which, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their refuſal, to admit the council's amendment to a money bill, gave him ſuch high provocation, that he was induced to diſſolve an aſſembly, whoſe prodigal liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality had juſtly expoſed them to the reſentment of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The new aſſembly, which met on the 14th of June, 1705, neglected the affair of the revenue and the additional duty, though his lordſhip ſtrongly recommended them both. Among the principal acts paſſed at this meeting, is that for
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:024800_0121_0FCD634C4B407288"/>the benefit of the clergy, who were entitled to the ſalaries formerly eſtabliſhed by colonel Fletcher; which, though leſs than his lordſhip recommended, was doubtleſs a grateful offering to his unceaſing zeal for the church, manifeſted in a part of his ſpeech at the opening of the ſeſſion, in theſe words: "The difficulties, which ſome very worthy miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the church of England have met with, in getting the maintenance ſettled upon them, by an act of the general aſſembly of this province, paſſed in the year 1693, moves me to propoſe to you the paſſing an act explanatory of the forementioned act, that thoſe worthy good men who have ventured to come ſo far for the ſervice of God in his church, and the good and edification of the people, to the ſalvation of their ſouls, may not for the future be vexed, as ſome of them have been; but may enjoy in quiet, that maintenance, which was by a law provided for them<note n="*" place="bottom">The majority of our people are of a contrary opinion, if my lord thought the eſtabliſhment was deſigned only for the epiſcopal clergy.</note>. I farther re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to you, the paſſing an act to provide for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of ſome miniſters, in ſome of the towns at the eaſt end of Long-Iſland, where I don't find any proviſion has been yet made for propagating religion."</p>
            <p>Our harbour being wholly unfortified, a French priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer actually entered it in 1705, and put the inhabitants into great conſternation. The aſſembly, at their ſeſſion in June, the next year, were not diſinclined, through the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of the people, to put the city in a better poſture of defence for the future; but being fully convinced, by his lordſhip's embezzlement of 1500<abbr>l.</abbr> formerly raiſed for two batteries at the narrows, and near 1000<abbr>l.</abbr> levied for the protection of the frontiers, that he was no more to be truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with public monies, offered a bill for raiſing 3000<abbr>l.</abbr> for fortifications, appointing that ſum to be depoſited in the hands of a private perſon of their own nomination; but his excellency did not paſs it till their next meeting in the fall, when he informed them that he had received the queen's commands, "to permit the general aſſembly to name their own treaſurer, when they raiſed extraordinary ſupplies for particular uſes, and which are no part of the ſtanding and conſtant revenue; the treaſurer being accountable to the three branches of the legiſlature, and the governor always acquainted with the occaſion of iſſuing ſuch warrants".</p>

His lordſhip's renewing the propoſal of raiſing fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations at the Narrows, which he had himſelf hitherto ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalouſly prevented, is a proof of his exceſſive effrontery and contempt of the people: and the neglect of the houſe, to take the leaſt notice, either of that matter, or the revenue, occaſioned another diſſolution.</p>
            <p>Before I proceed to the tranſactions of the new aſſembly, which did not meet till the year 1708, it will not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to lay before the reader, the account of a memor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able proof of that perſecuting ſpirit, which influenced lord Cornbury's whole adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>The inhabitants of the city of New-York conſiſted, at this time, of Dutch Calviniſts, upon the plan of the church of Holland; French refugees on the Geneva model; a few Engliſh epiſcopalians; and a ſtill ſmaller number of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and Iriſh preſbyterians; who, having neither a miniſter nor a church, uſed to aſſemble themſelves, every Sunday, at a private houſe, for the worſhip of God. Such were their circumſtances, when Francis M'Kemie and John Hampton, two preſbyterian miniſters, arrived here in January, 1707. As ſoon as lord Cornbury, who hated the whole perſuaſion, heard that the Dutch had conſented to M'Kemie's preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their church, he arbitrarily forbid it; ſo that the public worſhip, on the next ſabbath, was performed, with open doors, at a private houſe. Mr. Hampton preached, the ſame day, at the preſbyterian church in New-Town, diſtant a few miles from the city. At that village both theſe miniſters were two or three days after apprehended, by Cardwel, the ſheriff, purſuant to his lordſhip's warrant, for preaching without his licence. From hence they were led in triumph a circuit of ſeveral miles through Jamaica to New-York. They appeared before his lordſhip with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted courage, and had a conference with him, in which it is difficult to determine, whether my lord excelled in the character of a ſavage bigot, or an ill-mannerly tyrant. The miniſters were no lawyers, or they would not have founded their juſtification on the ſuppoſed extent of the Engliſh act of toleration. They knew not that the eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical ſtatutes had no relation to this colony; and that its religious ſtate conſiſted in a perfect parity between proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of all denominations. They erroneouſly ſuppoſed, that all the penal laws extended to this province, and relied, for their defence, on the toleration, offering teſtimonials of their having complied with the act of parliament in Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia and Maryland, and promiſed to certify the houſe, in which M'Kemie had preached, to the next ſeſſions. His lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:024800_0123_0FCD634F0F6E2E18"/>diſcourſe with them was the more ridiculous, becauſe he had Bickley, the attorney-general, to aſſiſt him. Againſt the extenſion of the ſtatute, they inſiſted, that the penal laws were limited to England, and ſo alſo the toleration act, becauſe the ſole intent of it was to take away the penalties formerly eſtabliſhed. But grant the poſition, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence they drew from it, argues that my lord and mr. at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney were either very weak, or influenced by evil deſigns. If the penal laws did not extend to the plantations, then the priſoners were innocent; for where there is no law, there can be no tranſgreſſion; but according to theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable ſages, if the penal laws and the toleration were reſtricted to the realm of England, as they contended, then the poor clergymen, for preaching without his licence, were guilty of a heinous crime, againſt his private, unpub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed inſtructions; and for this cauſe he iſſued an informal precept to the ſheriff of New-York, for their commitment to jail, till further orders. They continued in conſinement, through the abſence of Mompeſſon, the chief juſtice, who was in New-Jerſey, ſix weeks and four days; but were then brought before him, by writ of <hi>habeas corpus.</hi> Mom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſſon being a man of learning in his profeſſion, and his lordſhip now appriſed of the illegality of his firſt warrant, iſſued another, on the very day of the teſt of the writ, in which he virtually contradicts what he had before inſiſted on, at his conference with the priſoners. For according to this, they were impriſoned for preaching without being qualified as the toleration act required, though they had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered themſelves to the ſeſſions during their impriſonment. They were then bailed to the next ſupreme court, which began a few days after. Great pains were taken to ſecure a grand jury for the purpoſe, and among thoſe who found the indictment, to their ſhame be it remembered, were ſeveral Dutch and French proteſtants.</p>
            <p>Mr. M'Kemie returned to New-York, from Virginia, in June; and was now come to his trial on the indictment found at the laſt court: As to mr. Hampton, he was diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, no evidence being offered to the grand jury againſt him.</p>
            <p>Bickley, the attorney general, managed the proſecution in the name of the queen; Reignere, Nicoll, and Jamiſon appeared for the defendant. The trial was held on the 6th of June, and being a cauſe of great expectation, a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous audience attended. Roger Mompeſſon ſat on the bench as chief juſtice, with Robert Milward and Thomas Wenham, for his aſſiſtants. The indictment was, in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that Francis M'Kemie, pretending himſelf to be a
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:024800_0124_0FCD6350B1E19B88"/>proteſtant diſſenting miniſter, contemning and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſubvert the queen's eccleſiaſtical ſupremacy, unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully preached without the governor's licence firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, in derogation of the royal authority and preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: that he uſed other rites and ceremonies, than thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the common-prayer book. And laſtly, that being unqualified by law to preach, he nevertheleſs did preach at an illegal conventicle: and both theſe laſt charges were laid to be contrary to the form of the Engliſh ſtatutes. For it ſeems that mr. attorney was now of opinion, that the penal laws did extend to the American plantations, though his ſentiments were the very reverſe at the firſt debate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his excellency: but Bickley was rather remarkable for a voluble tongue, than a penetrating head, or much learning. To ſupport this proſecution, he endeavoured to prove the queen's eccleſiaſtical ſupremacy in the colonies, and that it was delegated to her noble couſin, the governor; and hence he was of opinion, that his lordſhip's inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons relating to church matters, had the force of a law. He, in the next place, contended for the extenſion of the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of uniformity, and, upon the whole, was pleaſed to ſay, that he did not doubt the jury would find a verdict for the queen. Reignere, for the defendant, inſiſted, that preaching was no crime by the common law; that the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of uniformity, and the act of toleration did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend here; and that the governor's inſtructions were not laws. Nicoll ſpoke to the ſame purpoſe, and ſo did David Jamiſon, but M'Kemie concluded the whole defence in a ſpeech, which ſets his capacity in a very advantageous light. The reader may ſee it in the narrative of this trial, which was firſt publiſhed at the time, and ſince reprinted at New-York in the year 1755. The chief juſtice, in his charge, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed a ſpecial verdict, but the jury found no difficulty to acquit the defendant, who, through the ſhameful parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of the court, was not diſcharged from his recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance, till they had illegally extorted all the fees of his proſecution, which, together with his expenſes, amounted to eighty-three pounds ſeven ſhillings and ſix pence.</p>
            <p>Lord Cornbury was now daily loſing the favour of the people. The friends of Leiſler had him in the utmoſt abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence from the beginning; and being all ſpies upon his conduct, it was impoſſible for his lordſhip to commit the ſmalleſt crime unnoticed. His perſecution of the preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians very early increaſed the number of his enemies. The Dutch, too, were fearful of his religious rage againſt them, as he diſputed their right to call and ſettle miniſters,
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:024800_0125_0FCD63522A967358"/>or even ſchoolmaſters, without his ſpecial licence. His ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive avarice, his embezzlement of the public money, and his ſordid refuſal to pay his private debts, bore ſo heavily upon his reputation, that it was impoſſible for his adherents, either to ſupport him, or themſelves, againſt the general oppoſition. Such being the temper of the people, his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip did not ſucceed according to his wiſhes in the new aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, which met on the 19th of Auguſt, 1708. The mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers were all againſt him, and William Nicoll was again choſen ſpeaker.</p>
            <p>Among the ſeveral things recommended to their conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, the affair of the revenue, which was to expire in May following, and the propriety of making preſents to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, were the chief. The houſe were not inſenſible of the importance of the Indian intereſt, and of the infinite arts of the French to ſeduce them from our alliance: but ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious that his lordſhip, who heretofore had given himſelf little concern about that matter, was ſeeking a freſh oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to defraud the public, they deſired him to give them a liſt of the articles of which the preſents were to conſiſt, together with an eſtimate of the charge, before they would provide for that donation.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the revenue, his lordſhip was not ſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, for the aſſembly reſolutely refuſed to continue it; tho' they conſented to an act to diſcharge him from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of 250<abbr>l.</abbr> and upwards, which he had made with one Hanſon for the public ſervice. Thomas Byerly was at that time, collector and receiver-general; and by pretending that the treaſury was exhauſted, the debts of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were unpaid. This gave riſe to many petitions to the aſſembly to make proviſion for their diſcharge. Colonel Schuyler, who had expended large ſums on the public cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, was among the principal ſufferers, and joined with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others in an application to the houſe, that Byerly might be compelled to account. The diſputes, relating to this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, took up a conſiderable part of the ſeſſion, and were litigated with great heat. Upon the whole, an act was paſſed for refunding 700<abbr>l.</abbr> which had been miſapplied.</p>
            <p>The reſolutions of the committee of grievances, approved by the houſe, ſhow the general objections of the people to his lordſhip's adminiſtration. Theſe were made at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the ſeſſion; and yet we find this haughty lord ſubdued by the oppoſition againſt him, and ſo diſpirited thro' indigence, and the inceſſant ſolicitations of his credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, that he not only omitted to juſtify himſelf, but to ſhow even an impotent reſentment. For after all the cenſures of
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:024800_0126_0FCD63538C8AF000"/>the houſe, he tamely thanked them, for paſſing the bill to diſcharge him from a ſmall debt, which they could not, in juſtice, have refuſed. The reſolutions were in theſe words:</p>
            <p>"Reſolved, That it is the opinion of this committee, that the appointing coroners in this colony, without their being choſen by the people, is a grievance, and contrary to law<note n="*" place="bottom">See lord Bacon's works, fol. edit. 2 vol. 152. and yet the coroners in every county are ſtill appointed by the governor.</note>.</p>
            <p>"Reſolved, That it is, and always has been, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable right of every freeman in this colony, that he hath a perfect and entire property in his goods and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate.</p>
            <p>"Reſolved, That the impoſing and levying of any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies upon her majeſty's ſubjects of this colony, under any pretence or colour whatſoever, without conſent in general aſſembly, is a grievance, and a violation of the people's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty.</p>
            <p>"Reſolved, That for any officer whatſoever, to extort from the people, extravagant and unlimited fees, or any money whatſoever, not poſitively eſtabliſhed and regulated by conſent in general aſſembly, is unreaſonable and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, a great grievance, and tending to the utter deſtruction of all property in this plantation.</p>
            <p>"Reſolved, That the erecting a court of equity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſent in general aſſembly, is contrary to law, without precedent, and of dangerous conſequence to the liberty and property of the ſubjects.</p>
            <p>"Reſolved, That the raiſing of money for the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or other neceſſary charge, by any tax, impoſt, or bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den on goods imported, or exported,—or any clog, or hindrance, on traffic or commerce,—is ſound by experience to be the expulſion of many, and the impoveriſhing of the reſt of the planters, freeholders, and inhabitants of this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony; of moſt pernicious conſequence, which, if continued, will unavoidably prove the ruin of the colony.</p>
            <p>"Reſolved, That the exceſſive ſums of money ſcrewed from maſters of veſſels trading here under the notion of port-charges, viſiting the ſaid veſſels by ſupernumerary of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and taking extraordinary fees, is the great diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of trade and ſtrangers coming among us, beyond the precedent of any other port, and without colour of law.</p>

               <pb n="131" facs="unknown:024800_0127_0FCD63562DB9BFE0"/>
"Reſolved, That the compelling any man upon trial by a jury, or otherwiſe, to pay any fees for his proſecution, or any thing whatſoever, unleſs the fees of the officers whom he employs for his neceſſary defence, is a great grievance, and contrary to juſtice.<note n="*" place="bottom">This had a ſpecial relation to the late proſecution of mr. M'Kemie.</note>."</p>
            <p>Lord Corubury was no leſs obnoxions to the people of New-Jerſey, than to thoſe of New-York. The aſſembly of that province, impatient of his tyranny, drew up a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint againſt him, which they ſent home to the queen.</p>
            <p>Her majeſty graciouſly liſtened to the cries of her injured ſubjects; diveſted him of his power, and appointed lord Lovelace in his ſtead; declaring that ſhe would not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance her neareſt relations in oppreſſing her people.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as my lord was ſuperſeded, his creditors threw him into the cuſtody of the ſheriff of New-York; and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained here till the death of his father, when ſucceeding to the earldom of Clarendon, he returned to England.</p>
            <p>We never had a governor ſo univerſally deteſted, nor any who ſo richly deſerved the public abhorrence. In ſpite of his noble deſcent, his behaviour was trifling, mean, and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant.</p>
            <p>It was not uncommon for him to dreſs himſelf in a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's habit, and then to patrole the fort in which he reſided. Such freaks of low humour expoſed him to the univerſal contempt of the people; but their indignation was kindled by his deſpotic rule, ſavage bigotry, inſatiable avarice, and injuſtice, not only to the public, but even his private credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. For he left ſome of the loweſt tradeſmen in his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment unſatisfied in their juſt demands.</p>
            <p>John lord Lovelace, baron of Hurley, was appointed to this government, in the ſpring, 1708, but did not arrive here till the 18th of December following. Lord Cornbury's oppreſſive, mean adminiſtration had long made the people very deſirous of a change; and therefore his ſucceſſor was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with univerſal joy. Having diſſolved the general aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, ſoon after his acceſſion to the government, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened a new one on the 5th of April, 1709, which, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of members of the ſame intereſt with the laſt, re-elected William Nicoll, the former ſpeaker, into the chair. His lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip told them, at the beginning of the ſeſſion. "That he had brought with him large ſupplies of ſoldiers and ſtores of
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:024800_0128_0FCD63581C7CF418"/>war as well as preſents for the Indians," than which nothing could be more agreeable to the people. He lamented the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the provincial debts, and the decay of public credit; but ſtill recommended their raiſing a revenue, for the ſame term with that eſtabliſhed by the act in the 11th year of the laſt reign. He alſo preſſed the diſcharge of the debts of the government, and their examination of the public accounts, "that it may be known (ſays he) what this debt is, and that it may appear hereafter to all the world that it was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted in my time." This oblique reflexion upon his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor, who was now ignominiouſly impriſoned by his creditors, was diſpleaſing to no body.</p>
            <p>Tho' the aſſembly, in their anſwer, heartily congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated his lordſhip's arrival, and thanked the queen for her care of the province, yet they ſufficiently intimated their diſinclination to raiſe the revenue, which the governor had requeſted. "Our earneſt wiſhes (to uſe the words of the addreſs) are, that ſuitable meaſures may be taken, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the few inhabitants left, to ſtay in it, and others to come. The juſt freedom enjoyed by our neighbours, by the tender indulgence of the government, has extremely drain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and exhauſted us both of people and ſtock; whilſt a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent treatment, the wrong methods too long taken, and ſeverities practiſed here, have averted and deterred the uſual part of mankind from ſettling and coming hitherto." Towards the cloſe, they aſſure him, "That as the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his government gave them a delightful proſpect of tranquillity, ſo they were come with minds prepared to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the good of the country and his ſatisfaction."</p>
            <p>The principal matter, which engaged the attention of the aſſembly, was the affair of the revenue. Lord Cornbury's conduct had rendered them utterly averſe to a permanent ſupport for the future; and yet they were unwilling to quarrel with the new governor. They however, at laſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on the 5th of May, to raiſe 2500<abbr>l.</abbr> to defray the charges of the government to the 1ſt of May enſuing; 1600<abbr>l.</abbr> of which was voted to his excellency, and the remaining ſums towards a ſupply of firewood and candles to the ſeveral forts in New-York, Albany, and Schenectady; and for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſmall ſalaries to the printer, clerk of the council, and Indian interpreter.</p>
            <p>This new project of providing, annually, for the ſupport of government, was contrived to prevent the miſchiefs, to which the long revenues had formerly expoſed us. But as it rendered the governor, and all the other ſervants of the crown dependent upon the aſſembly, a rupture, between
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:024800_0129_0FCD63599893AFE0"/>the ſeveral branches of the legiſlature, would doubtleſs have enſued: but the very day, in which the vote paſſed the houſe, his lordſhip died of a diſorder contracted in croſſing the ferry at his firſt arrival in the city of New-York. His lady continued here, long after his death, ſoliciting for the ſum voted to her huſband; but though the queen interpoſed, by a letter, in her behalf, nothing was allowed till ſeveral years afterwards.</p>

            <p>LORD Lovelace being dead, the chief command devolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Richard Ingolſby, the lieutenant-governor, the ſame who had exerciſed the government ſeveral years before, upon the deceaſe of colonel Sloughter. His ſhort ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration is remarkable, not for his extraordinary talents, for he was a heavy man, but for a ſecond fruitleſs attempt againſt Canada. Colonel Vetch, who had been, ſeveral years before, at Quebec, and ſounded the river of St. Lawrence, was the firſt projector of this enterpriſe. The miniſtry ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of it, and Vetch arrived in Boſton, and prevailed upon the New-England colonies to join in the ſcheme. After that, he came to New-York, and concerted the plan of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations with Francis Nicholſon, formerly our lieutenant-governor, who, at the requeſt of Ingolſby, the council, the aſſembly, Gurdon Saitonſtal, the governor of Connecticut, and Charles Gookin, lieutenant governor of Pennſylvania, accepted the chief command of the provincial forces, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to penetrate into Canada, by the way of lake Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain. Impoveriſhed as we were, the aſſembly joined heartily in the enterpriſe. It was at this juncture, our firſt act for iſſuing bills of credit was paſſed; an expedient without which we could not have contributed to the expedition, the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury

As ſoon, therefore, as lord Sunde land's letters, which arrived here on the 21ſt of October, were laid before the houſe, they reſolved to ſend an addreſs to the queen, to lay before he a true account of the manner, in which this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince exerted itſelf in the late undertaking.</p>

Had this expedition been vigorouſly carried on, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it would have ſucceeded. The public affairs at home were conducted by a wiſe miniſtry. The allied army tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed in repeated ſucceſſes in Flanders; and the court of France was in no condition to give aſſiſtance to ſo diſtant a colony as Canada. The Indians of the five nations were engaged, through the indefatigable ſolicitations of colonel Schuyler, to join heartily in the attempt: and the eaſtern colonies had nothing to fear from the Ouwenagungas; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe Indians had, a little before, concluded a peace with the confederates. In America, every thing was ripe for the attack. At home, lord Sunderland, the ſecretary of ſtate, had proceeded ſo far, as to diſpatch orders to the queen's ſhips at Boſton, to hold themſelves in readineſs, and the Britiſh troops were upon the point of their embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion. At this juncture, the news arrived of the deſcat of the Portugueſe, which reducing our allies to great ſtreights, the forces intended for the American adventure were then ordered to their aſſiſtance, and the thoughts of the miniſtry entirely diverted from the Canada expedition.</p>
            <p>As we had not a man in this province, who had more extended views of the importance of driving the French out of Canada, than colonel Schuyler, ſo neither did any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon more heartily engage in the late expedition. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the friendſhip of the five nations, without which it would be impoſſible to prevent our frontiers from becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a field of blood, he ſtudied all the arts of inſinuating himſelf into their favour. He gave them all poſſible encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement and aſſiſtance, and very much impaired his own fortune, by his liberality to their chiefs. They never came to Albany, but they reſorted to his houſe, and even dined at his table; and by this means, he obtained an aſcendency over them, which was attended with very good conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the province; for he could always, in a great degree, obviate or e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>dicate the prejudices and jealouſies, by which the French jeſuits were inceſſantly labouring to debauch their fidelity.</p>
            <p>Impreſſed with a ſtrong ſenſe of the neceſſity of ſome vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous meaſures againſt the French, colonel Schuyler was extremely diſcontented at the late diſappointment; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to make a voyage to England at his private expenſe, the better to inculcate on the miniſtry, the abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of reducing Canada to the crown of Great-Britain. For that purpoſe, he propoſed to carry home with him five Indian chiefs. The houſe no ſooner heard of his deſign, than they came to a reſolution, which, in juſtice to
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:024800_0133_0FCD63640DD55220"/>his diſtinguiſhed merit, I ought not to ſuppreſs. It was this:</p>
            <p>"Reſolved, nemine contradicento, that the humble ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of the lieutenat-governor, council, and general aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of this colony to the queen, repreſenting the preſent ſtate of this plantation, be committed to his charge and care, to be preſented by himſelf to her ſacred majeſty; he being a perſon, who, not only in the laſt war, when he commanded the forces of this colony in chief at Canada, but alſo in the preſent, has performed faithful ſervices, to this and the neighbouring colonies; and behaved himſelf in the offices, with which he has been entruſted, with good reputation, and the general ſatisfaction of the people in theſe parts."</p>
            <p>The arrival of the five ſachems in England, made a great bruit through the whole kingdom. The mob followed wherever they went, and ſmall cuts of them were ſold among the people. The court was at that time in mourning for the death of the prince of Denmark: theſe American kings<note n="*" place="bottom">This title is commonly beſtowed on the ſachems, though the Indians have no ſuch dignity or office among them.</note> were therefore dreſſed in black underclothes, after the Engliſh manner; but inſtead of a blanket, they had each a ſcarlet-in-grain cloth mantle, edged with gold, thrown over all their other garments. This dreſs was direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the dreſſers of the playhouſe, and given by the queen, who was adviſed to make a ſhow of them. A more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſolemnity attended the audience they had of her majeſty. Sir Charles Cotterel conducted them, in two coaches, to St. James's; and the lord chamberlain introduced them into the royal preſence. Their ſpeech, on the 19th of April, 1710, is preſerved by Oldmixon, and was in theſe words:</p>

                        <p>We doubt not but our great queen has been acquainted with our long and tedious war, in conjunction with her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, againſt her enemies the French: and that we have been as a ſtrong wall for their ſecurity, even to the loſs of our beſt men.

The reduction of Canada is of great weight to our free hunting; ſo that if our great queen ſhould not be mindful of us, we muſt, with our families, forſake our country, and ſeek other habitations, or ſtand neuter, either of which will be much againſt our incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</p>

            <p>Hunter was a native of Scotland, and, when a boy, put apprentice to an apothecary. He left his maſter, and went into the army; and being a man of wit and perſonal beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, recommended himſelf to lady Hay, whom he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards married. In the year 1707, he was appointed lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-governor of Virginia, but being taken by the French in his voyage to that colony, he was carried into France, and upon his return to England, appointed to ſucceed lord Lovelace in the government of this and the province of New-Jerſey. Dean Swift's letter to him, during his captivity, ſhows that he had the honour of an intimacy with mr. Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and others, who were diſtinguiſhed for their good ſenſe and learning; and perhaps it was by their intereſt, he was advanced to this profitable place.</p>
            <p>Governor Hunter brought over with him near three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand palatines, who, the year before, fled to England from the rage of perſecution in Germany. Many of theſe people ſeated themſelves in the city of New-York, where they built a Lutheran church, which is now in a declining condition.
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:024800_0135_0FCD6369CB21A3D0"/>Others ſettled on a tract of ſeveral thouſand acres, in the manor of Livingſton. Their village there, called the camp, is one of the pleaſanteſt ſituations on Hudſon's river: right oppoſite, on the weſt bank, are many other families of them. Some went into Pennſylvania, and by the favourable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of the country, which they tranſmitted to Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, were inſtrumental to the tranſmigration of many thouſands of their countrymen into that province. Queen Anne's liberality to theſe people, was not more beneficial to them, than ſerviceable to this colony. They have behav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves peaceably, and lived with great induſtry. Many are rich. all are proteſtants, and well affected to the government. The ſame muſt be ſaid of thoſe who have lately ſettled amongſt us, and planted the lands weſtward of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany. We have not the leaſt ground for jealouſy with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to them. Amongſt us they are few in number, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to thoſe in Pennſylvania. There they are too numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, to be ſoon aſſimilated to a new conſtitution. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all the manners and principles which prevail in their native country, and, as many of them are papiſts, ſome are not without their fears, that, ſooner or later, they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come dangerous to our colonies.<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſurpriſing importation of Germans into that colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, gave riſe to the ſcheme of diſpenſing Engliſh clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and ſchoolmaſters among them. The project is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on principles of ſound policy. If a political miſſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Indians had been ſeaſonably encouraged, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Pennſylvania might have eſcaped all that ſhocking devaſtation, which enſued the fatal defeat of general Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock's army on the 9th of July, 1755; and would, perhaps, have prevented even the erection of fort Queſne, which has already coſt the nation ſo much blood and treaſure.</note>

            <p>The late attempt to attack Canada proving abortive, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed us to conſequences equally calamitous, dreaded, and foreſeen. While the preparations were making to invade it, the French exerted themſelves in cajoling their Indian al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies to aſſiſt in the repulſe, and as ſoon as the ſcheme drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, numerous parties were ſent out to ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>raſs the Engliſh frontiers. Theſe irruptions were, principally, made on the northern parts of New-England, where the moſt ſavage cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were daily committed. New-York had, indeed, hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to eſcaped, being covered by the Indians of the five nations; but the danger we were in, induced governor Hunter, ſoon after his arrival, to make a voyage to Albany, where he met
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:024800_0136_0FCD636C521257C0"/>the confederate chiefs, and renewed the old covenant. While there, he was ſtrongly ſolicited, by the New-England governments, to engage our Indians in a war with thoſe who were daily ravaging their borders: but he prudently declined a meaſure, which might have expoſed his own province to a general deva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cation. A treaty of neutrality ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, at that time, between the confederates and the Canada French and their Indians; which, depending upon the faith of lawleſs ſavages, was, at beſt, but precarious, and yet the only ſecurity we had for the peare of our borders. A rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture between them would have involved us in a ſcene of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, at a time, of all others, moſt unſeaſonable. However the people of New-England might cenſure the governor, it was a proof of wiſdom to refuſe their requeſt. For beſides a want of men and arms to deſend us, our forts were fallen down, and the treaſury exhauſted.</p>
            <p>The new aſſembly met, at New-York, ou the 1ſt of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember. Mr. Nicoll, the ſpeaker, mr. Livingſton, mr. de Lancey, and colonel Morris, were the members moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed for their activity in the houſe. Mr. de Lancey was a proteſtant refugee, a native of Caen in Normandy; and by marrying a daughter of mr. Courtlandt, connected with a family, then, perhaps, the moſt opulent and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of any in the province. He was an eminent merchant, and, by a ſucceſsful trade, had amaſſed a very conſiderable fortune. But of all theſe colonel Morris had the greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on our public affairs. He was a man of letters, and though a little whimſical in his temper, was grave in his manners, and of penetrating parts. Being exceſſively fond of the ſociety of men of ſenſe and reading, he was never wearied at a ſitting, till the ſpirits of the whole company were diſſipated. From his infancy, he had lived in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner beſt adapted to teach him the nature of man, and to fortify his mind for the viciſſitudes of life. He very early loſt both his father and mother, and fell under the patron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of his uncle, formerly an officer, of very conſiderable rank in Cromwell's army; who, after the reſtoration, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed himſelf under the profeſſion of quakeriſm, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled on a fine farm, within a few miles of the city, called, after his own name, Morriſania. Being a boy of ſtrong paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, (the general indications of a fruitful genius,) he gave frequent offence to his uncle, and, on one of theſe occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, through fear of his reſentment, ſtrolled away into Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, and thence to Jamaica in the Weſt-Indies, where, to ſupport himſelf, he ſet up for a ſcrivener. After ſeveral years ſpent in this vagabond life, he returned again to bi
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:024800_0137_0FCD636DCE3E83D0"/>uncle, who received the young prodigal with joy; and, to reduce him to regularity, brought about his marriage with a daughter of mr. Graham, a fine lady, with whom he lived above fifty years, in the poſſeſſion of every enjoyment, which good ſenſe and polite manners in a woman could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>. The greateſt part of his life, before the arrival of mr. Hunter, was ſpent in New-Jerſey<note n="*" place="bottom">He was one of the council in that province, and a judge of the ſupreme court there, in 1692. Upon the ſurrender of the government to queen Anne, in 1702, he was named to be governor of the colony; but the appointment was changed in favour of lord Cornbury, the queen's couſin.</note>, where he ſignalized himſelf in the ſervice both of the proprietors and the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. The latter employed him to draw up their complaint againſt my lord Cornbury, and he was made the bearer of it to the queen. Though he was indolent in the management of his private affairs, yet, through the love of power, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> always buſy in matters of a political nature, and no man in the colony equalled him in the knowledge of the law and the arts of intrigue. From this character, the reader will eaſily perceive, that governor Hunter ſhowed his prudence, in taking mr. Morris into his confidence, his talents and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages rendering him either a uſeful friend or formidable foe. Such were the acting members of this aſſembly. When brigadier Hunter ſpoke to them, he recommended the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling a revenue, the defence of the frontiers, and the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the public credit, which lord Cornbury had al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>moſt entirely deſtroyed. To ſtifle the remaining ſparks of our ancient feuds, he concluded with theſe words: "If any go about to diſturb your peace, by reviving buried parties or piques, or creating new ones, they ſhall meet with no countenance or encouragement from me; and I am ſure they deſerve as little from you." The addreſs of the houſe was perfectly agreeable to the governor. They promiſed to provide for the ſupport of government, and to reſtore the public credit, as well as to protect the frontiers. In anſwer to the cloſe of his ſpeech, they declare their hope, "That ſuch as excited party contentions, might meet with as little credit, and as much diſgrace, as they deſerve." This una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity, however, was ſoon interrupted. Colonel Morris, for ſome warm words dropped in a debate, was expelled the houſe; and ſoon after a diſpute aroſe, between the council and aſſembly, concerning ſome amendments, made by the former, to a bill "for the treaſurer's paying ſundry
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:024800_0138_0FCD637238460950"/>ſums of money." The deſign of it, in mentioning the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſums, and rendering them iſſuable by their own of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, was to reſtrain the governor from repeating the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applications which had been ſo frequent in a late adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration. The council, for that reaſon, oppoſed it, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to their amendments; which occaſioned a prorogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, on the 25th of November, after the paſſing of ſeveral other neceſſity laws.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hunter cautiouſly avoided entering, publicly, into the diſpute between the two houſes, till he knew the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of the miniſtry, and then he opened the ſpring ſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions with a ſpeech too ſingular not to he inſerted.</p>

I hope you will make ſuitable returns, leſt ſome inſinuations, much repeated of late years, ſhould gain credit at laſt, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever your reſentment has fallen upon the governor, it is the government you diſlike.</p>
                        <p>It is neceſſary, at this time, that you be told alſo, that giving money for the ſupport of government, and diſpoſing of it at your pleaſure, is the ſame with giving none at all. Her majeſty is the ſole judge of the merits of her ſervants. This right has never yet been diſputed at home, and ſhould I conſent to give it up abroad, I ſhould render myſelf unworthy, not only of the truſt repoſed in me, but of the ſociety of my fellow ſubjects, by incurring her higheſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure. If I have tired you by a long ſpeech, I ſhall make
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:024800_0139_0FCD63731312B0C0"/>amends by parting you to the trouble of a very ſhort an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
                        <p>Will you ſupport her majeſty's government, in the manner ſhe has been pleaſed to direct, or are you reſolved that burden ſhall lie ſtill upon the governor, who cannot accuſe himſelf of any thing that may have deſerved this treatment at your hands?</p>
                        <p>Will you take care of the debts of the government; or, to increaſe my ſufferings, muſt I continue under the torture of the daily cries of ſuch as have juſt demands upon you, and are in miſery, without the power of giving them my hopes of relief?</p>
                        <p>Will you take more effectual care of your own ſafety, in that of your frontiers; or are you reſolved for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to rely upon the ſecurity of an open winter, and the caprice of your ſavage neighbours? I ſhall be very ſorry if this plainneſs offends you. I judge it neceſſary towards the eſtabliſhing and cultivating a good underſtanding betwixt us. I hope it will be ſo conſtrued, and wiſh heartily it may have that effect."</p>

            <p>Perplexed with this remarkable ſpeech, the aſſembly, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a few days, concluded, that as his excellency had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued them in February, while he was at Burlington, in the province of New-Jerſey, they could not ſit and act as a houſe; upon which, they were the ſame day diſſolved.</p>
            <p>The five Indian kings, carried to England by colonel Schuyler, having ſeen all the curioſities in London, and been much entertained by many perſons of diſtinction, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Boſton, with commodore Martin and colonel Nicholſon; the latter of whom commanded the forces de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned againſt Port-Royal and the coaſt of Nova-Scotia. In this enterpriſe the New-England colonies, agreeable to their wonted courage and loyalty, lent their aſſiſtance; and the reduction of the garriſon, which was then called Annapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>is-Royal, was happily completed on the 2d of October, 1710. Animated by this, and ſome other ſucceſſes in New-foundland, Nicholſon again urged the proſecution of the ſcheme for the reduction of Canada; which, having been ſtrongly recommended by the Indian chiefs, as the only ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual means to ſecure the northern colonies, was now again reſumed.</p>
            <p>Towards the execution of this project, five thouſand troops from England and Flanders, were ſent over under the command of brigadier Hill, the brother of mrs. Maſham, the queen's new confidant, on the diſgrace of the ducheſs of
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:024800_0140_0FCD6374C0D14250"/>Marlborough. The fleet of tranſports, under the convoy of ſir Hoveden Walker, arrived, after a month's paſſage, at Boſton, on the 4th of June, 1711. The proviſions, with which they expected to be ſupplied there, being not provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the troops landed. Nicholſon, who was to command the land forces, came immediately to New-York, where in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. Hunter convened the aſſembly, on the 2d of July. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>election of the ſame members, who had ſerved in the laſt, was a ſufficient proof of the general averſion to the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a revenue. Robert Livingſton, junior, who married the only daughter of colonel Schuyler, came in for Albauy; and, together with mr. Morris, who was again choſen for the borough of Weſt-Cheſter, joined the governor's intereſt. Brigadier Hunter informed the aſſembly of the intended expedition, and the arrival of the fleet and forces; that the quota of this province, ſettled by the council of war, at New-London, was 600 private centinels and their officers: beſides which, he recommended their making proviſion for building batteaus, tranſporting the troops and proviſions, ſubſiſting the Indians, and for the contingent charges: nor did he forget to mention the ſupport of government and the public debts.</p>
            <p>The houſe was ſo well pleaſed with the deſign upon Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada, that they voted an addreſs of thanks to the queen, and ſent a committee to Nicholſon, to congratulate his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, and make an honourable acknowledgment of his "ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous application to her majeſty for reducing Canada." In a few days time, an act was paſſed for raiſing forces; and the aſſembly, by a reſolution, according to the governor's advice, reſtricted the price of proviſions to certain particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſums. Bills of credit, for forwarding the expedition, were now alſo ſtruck, to the amount of 10,000<abbr>d.</abbr> to be ſunk in five years, by a tax on eſtates real and perſonal. After theſe ſupplies were granted, the governor prorogued the aſſembly; though nothing was done relating to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſupport of government.</p>
            <p>While theſe preparations were making at New-York, the fleet, conſiſting of twelve men of war, forty tranſports, and ſix ſtore-ſhips, with forty horſes, a fine train of artillery and all manner of warlike ſtores, ſailed for Canada, from Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, on the 30th of July; and, about a month afterwards, Nicholſon appeared at Albany, at the head of an army of four thouſand men, raiſed in this and the colonies of New-Jerſey and Connecticut: the ſeveral regiments being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by colonel Ingolſby, colonel Whiting, and colonel
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:024800_0141_0FCD637B709A98B0"/>Schuyler, the latter of whom procured 600 of the five na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to join our army.</p>
            <p>The French, in Canada, were not unappriſed of theſe deſigns. Vandreuil, the governor general, ſent his orders, from Montreal, to the ſieur de Beaucourt, to haſten the works he was about at Quebee, and commanded that all the regulars and militia ſhould be held in readineſs to march on the firſt warning. Four or five hundred Indians, of the more diſtant nations, arrived at the ſame time at Montreal, with meſſieurs St. Pierre and Tonti, who, together with the Caghnuaga proſelytes, took up the hatchet in favour of the French. Vaudreuil after diſpatching ſeveral Indians and two miſſionaries among the five nations, to detach them from our intereſt, went to Quebec, which Beaucourt, the engineer, had ſufficiently fortified to ſuſtain a long ſiege. All the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal poſts below the city, on both ſides of the river, were prepared to receive the Britiſh troops in caſe of their land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. On the 14th of Auguſt, ſir Hoveden Walker arrived with the fleet in the mouth of St. Lawrence river; and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to loſe the company of the tranſports, the wind blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freſh at north-weſt, he put into Gaſpy bay, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued there till the 20th of the ſame month. Two days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he ſailed from thence, the fleet was in the utmoſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, for they had no ſoundings, were without ſight of land, the wind high at eaſt-ſouth-eaſt, and the ſky darkened by a thick fog. In theſe circumſtances, the fleet brought to, by the advice of the pilots, who were of opinion, that if the ſhipe lay with their heads to the ſouthward, they might be driven by the ſtream into the midſt of the channel: but inſtead of that, in two hours after, they found themſelves on the north ſhore, among rocks and iſlands, and upon the point of being loſt. The men of war eſcaped, but eight tranſports, containing eight hundred ſouls, officers, ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and ſeamen, were caſt away. Two or three days being ſpent, in recovering what they could from the ſhore, it was determined, at a conſultation of ſea officers, to return to ſome bay or harbour, till a further reſolution could be taken. On the 14th of September, they arrived at Spaniſh-River bay, where a council of war, conſiſting of land and ſea of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, conſidering that they had but ten weeks proviſion, and judging that they could not depend upon a ſupply from New-England, unanimouſly concluded to return home, without making any farther attempts; and they according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arrived at Portſmouth on the 9th of October, when, in addition to our misfortunes, the Edgar, a 70 gun ſhip, was
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:024800_0142_0FCD637CCD85C6D8"/>blown up, having on board above four hundred men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides many perſons who came to viſit their friends.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the marquis de Vaudreuil, by the accounts of the fiſhermen and two other ſhips, had reaſon to ſuſpect that our fleet was returned, he went to Chambly, and formed a camp of three thouſand men to oppoſe Nicholſon's army, intended to penetrate Canada, at that end. But he was ſoon informed that our troops were returned, upon the news of the diſaſter which had befallen the fleet, and that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Albany were in the utmoſt conſternation.</p>
            <p>The new miniſtry are generally cenſured for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in this expedition by the whigs, who condemn both the project and the meaſures taken towards its execution. The ſcheme was never laid before the parliament, though it was then ſitting; but this, it is ſaid, was for the greater ſecrecy, and for the ſame reaſon, the fleet was not fully victualled at home. They relied upon New-England for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, and this deſtroyed the deſign. For the ſhips tarried at Boſton, till the ſeaſon for the attack was over.</p>
            <p>According to lord Harley's account of this expedition, the whole was a contrivance of Bolingbroke, Moore, and the lord chancellor Harcourt, to cheat the public of twenty thouſand pounds. The latter of theſe was pleaſed to ſay, "No government was worth ſerving, that would not admit of ſuch advantageous jobs."</p>
            <p>Apprehenſive that the enemy would fall upon our bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as they afterwards really did, in ſmall parties, upon the miſcarriage of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>at enterpriſe; governor Hunter preſſed the aſſembly, in autumn, to continue a number of men in pay the enſuing winter, and to repair the out-forts. After the houſe had paſſed ſeveral votes to this purpoſe, his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, during the ſeſſion, went up to Albany, to withdraw the forces of the colony, and give orders for the neceſſary repairs.</p>
            <p>The public debts, by this unfortunate expedition, were become greatly enhanced, and the aſſembly, at laſt, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon meaſures for the ſupport of the government, and ſent up to the council ſeveral bills for that purpoſe. The latter attempted to make amendments, which the other would not admit, and a warm controverſy aroſe between thoſe two branches of the legiſlature. The council aſſigned inſtances, that amendments had formerly been allowed: and, beſides this argument, drawn from precedent, inſiſted that they were a part of the legiſlature, conſtituted as the aſſembly were, "by the mere grace of the crown;" adding that the lords of made had determined the matter in their
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:024800_0143_0FCD637E59115008"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>. The houſe nevertheleſs, adhered to their reſolutions, and anſwered in theſe words:</p>
            <p>"'Tis true, the ſhare the council have (if any) in the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlation, does not flow from any title they have from the nature of that board, which is only to adviſe; or from their being another diſtinct ſtate, or rank of people in the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, which they are not, being all commons; but only from the mere pleaſure of the prince, ſignified in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. On the contrary, the inherent right the aſſembly have to diſpoſe of the money of the freemen of this colony, does not proceed from any commiſſion, letters patent, or other grant from the crown; but from the free choice and election of the people, who ought not to be diveſted of their property (nor juſtly can) without their conſent. Any former condeſcenſions, of other aſſemblies, will not preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe to the council, a privilege to make any of thoſe amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and therefore they have it not. If the lords com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners for trade and plantations, did conceive no reaſon why the council ſhould not have right to amend money bills, this is far from concluding there are none. The aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly underſtand them very well, and are ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the neceſſity they are in, not to admit of any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment ſo much to their prejudice."</p>
            <p>Both houſes adhered obſtinately to their reſpective opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: in conſequence of which, the public debts remained unpaid, though his excellency could not omit paſſing a bill for paying to himſelf 3750 ounces of plate.</p>
            <p>Upon the return of the fleet, Dudley, Saltonſtal, and Cranſton, the governors of the eaſtern colonies, formed a deſign of engaging the five nations in a rupture with the French, and wrote on that head to mr. Hunter; who, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious that his aſſembly would not approve of any project that might increaſe the public debts, laid their letter before the houſe, and, according to his expectations, they declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the ſcheme.</p>
            <p>About this time colonel Hunter, by the advice of his council, began to exerciſe the office of chancellor, having, on the 4th of October, appointed meſſieurs Van Dam and Philipſe, maſters, mr. Whileman, regiſter, mr. Harriſon, examiner, and meſſieurs Sharpas and Broughton, clerks. A proclamation was then iſſued, to ſignify the ſitting of the court on Thurſday in every week. This gave riſe to theſe two reſolutions of the houſe.</p>
            <p>"Reſolved, that the erecting a court of chancery, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſent in general aſſembly, is contrary to law, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:024800_0144_0FCD637FCE466B40"/>precedent, and of dangerous conſequences to the liberty and property of the ſubjects.</p>
            <p>"That the eſtabliſhing fees, without conſent in general aſſembly, is contrary to law." The council made theſe votes the ſubject of part of a long repreſentation, which they ſhortly after tranſmitted to the lords of trade, who, in a letter to the governor, in anſwer to it, approved of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting a court of equity, and blamed the aſſembly; adding, "That her majeſty has an undoubted right of appointing ſuch, and ſo many courts of judicature, in the plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as ſhe ſhall think neceſſary for the diſtribution of juſtice."</p>
            <p>At the next meeting, in May 1712, colonel Hunter ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recommended the public debts to the conſideration of the aſſembly, informing them, that the lords of trade had ſignified their opinion, with reſpect to the amending money bills, in favour of the council. The houſe neglected the matters laid before them, and the governor broke up the ſeſſion by a ſhort prorogation of three days. After which they ſoon paſſed an act for paying his excellency 8025 ounces of plate. Our public affairs never wore a more melancholy aſpect than at this juncture.</p>
            <p>Among the five nations many emiſſaries from the French were daily ſeducing them from the Britiſh intereſt, and our late ill ſucceſs gave ſuch a powerful influence to their ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, that the Indians even at Catt's Kill ſent a belt of Wampum to thoſe in Ducheſs county, to prepare for a war. The Senecas and Shawanas were alſo greatly diſaffected: and it was generally apprehended that they would fall upon the inhabitants along Hudſon's river. An invaſion was ſtrongly ſuſpected, by ſea, on the city of New-York, where they had been alarmed, in April, by an inſurrection of the negroes; who, in execution of a plot to ſet fire to the town, had burnt down a houſe in the night, and killed ſeveral people who came to extinguiſh the fire, for which nineteen of them were afterwards executed. But diſtreſſed as the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony then was, the aſſembly were inflexibly averſe to the eſtabliſhment of a revenue, which had formerly been wickedly miſapplied and exhauſted. At the enſuing ſeſſion, in the fall, colonel Hunter propoſed a ſcheme to the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, which was, in ſubſtance, that the receiver-general ſhould give ſecurity, reſiding in the colony, for the due execution of his office; and, every quarter, account, to the governor and council, for the ſums he might receive. That the creditors of the government ſhould, every three months,
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:024800_0145_0FCD63ED15BF1BB0"/>deliver in their demands to the governor and council; when, if that quarter's revenue equalled the amount of ſuch debts, the governor, by the advice of council, ſhould draw for it; but if the revenue for that quarter, ſhould fall ſhort of the governor's demands; then the warrants were to be drawn for ſo much only as remained, and the creditors ſhould afterwards receive new drafts for their balances in the next quarter. That no warrant ſhould be iſſued, until the quarterly account of the revenue was given in; but that then they ſhould be paid in courſe, and an action of debt be given againſt the receiver-general in caſe of refuſal. That he ſhould account alſo to the aſſembly when required, and permit all perſons to have recourſe to his books. The houſe turned a deaf ear to this plauſible project, and, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with a letter from the lords of trade, favouring the council's claim to amend money bills, they agreed upon an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to the queen, proteſting their willingneſs to ſupport her government, complaining of miſapplications in the treaſury, intimating their ſuſpicions that they were miſrepreſented, and praying an inſtruction to the governor to give his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to a law, for ſupporting an agent to repreſent them at the court of Great Britain. Provoked by this conduct, and to put an end to the diſputes ſubſiſting between the two houſes, his excellency diſſolved the aſſembly.</p>
            <p>Before the meeting of the next aſſembly, the peace of Utrecht was concluded, on the 31ſt of March, 1713. A peace, in the judgment of many, diſhonourable to Great-Britain, and injurious to her allies. I ſhall only conſider it with relation to our Indian affairs. The reader doubtleſs obſerved, that lord Bellamont, after the peace at Ryſwick, contended with the governor of Canada, that the five na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ought to be conſidered as ſubjects of the Britiſh crown, and that the point was diſputed even after the death of count Frontenac. It does not appear that any deciſion of that matter was made between the two crowns, till the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Utrecht, the XVth article of which is in theſe words:</p>
            <p>"The ſubjects of France inhabiting Canada, and others, ſhall hereafter give no hindrance or moleſtation to the five nations, or cantons of Indians, ſubject to the dominion of Great-Britain, nor to the other nations of America who are friends to the ſame. In like manner, the ſubjects of Great-Britain ſhall behave themſelves peaceably towards the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans, who are ſubjects or friends to France; and on both ſides, they ſhall enjoy full liberty of going and coming on account of trade. Alſo the natives of theſe countries ſhall,
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:024800_0146_0FCD63841EF621D8"/>with the ſame liberty, reſort, as they pleaſe, to the Britiſh and French colonies, for promoting trade on one ſide and the other, without any moleſtation or hindrance, either on the part of the Britiſh ſubjects, or of the French. But it is to be exactly and diſtinctly ſettled by commiſſaries, who are, and who ought to be, accounted the ſubjects of Britain or of France."</p>
            <p>In conſequence of this treaty, the Britiſh crown became entitled, at leaſt for any claim that could juſtly be interpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the French, to the ſovereignty over the country of the five nations, concerning the extent of which, as it never was adjuſted by commiſſaries, it may not be improper to ſay a few words.</p>
            <p>When the Dutch began the ſettlement of this country, all the Indians on Long-Iſland, and the northern ſhore of the ſound, on the banks of Connecticut, Hudſon's, Delaware, and Suſquehanna rivers, were in ſubjection to the five nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and, within the memory of perſons now living, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged it by the payment of an annual tribute<note n="*" place="bottom">A little tribe, ſettled at the ſugar-loaf mountain in Orange county, to this day make a yearly payment of about 20<abbr>l.</abbr> to the Mohawks.</note>.

It is watered with many rivers. The land is in ſome places broken, but, generally ſpeaking, very fertile."</p>
            <p>In this partial deſcription, the jeſuit is neither conſiſtent with his geographer, nor ſeveral other French authors; and yet both his hiſtory and mr. Bellin's maps, in 1744<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Bellin publiſhed a new ſet of maps in 1745, the firſt plate being thought too favourable to our claims, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the protraction of the north ſide of the bay of Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, for Nova Scotia, which, in the ſecond plate, was called "the ſouth part of New France." General Shirley, one of the Britiſh commiſſaries for ſettling the diſputed limits, took occaſion to ſpeak of this alteration to mr. Bellin at Paris, and informed him that 100 copies of his firſt maps were diſperſed in London, upon which he diſcovered ſome ſurpriſe; but inſtead of urging any thing in ſupport of the variation in his new draft, ſaid, ſmiling, "we in France muſt follow the command of the monarch." I mention this to ſhow, that ſince the French government interpoſes in the conſtruction of their maps, they are proper evidence againſt them. Among the Engliſh, dr. Mitchel's is the only authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic one extant. None of the reſt, concerning America, have paſſed under the examination, or received the ſanction of any public board; and, for this reaſon, they ought not to be conſtrued to our prejudice. Add, that they generally copy from the French.</note>, which are bound up with it, furniſh many ſtrong evidences in favour of the Britiſh claims. I will point out a few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:024800_0148_0FCD6388D66FAAE8"/>The ancient country of the Hurons is laid down on the north ſide of lake Erie, by which we are aſcertained of the extent of territory, to which the five nations are enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled by their conqueſt of that people. The right of the confederates to the ſouth ſide of that lake, is alſo eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their diſperſion of the Cat Indians, to whom it origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally belonged. The land, on both ſides of the lake Ontario, is admitted to be theirs by this geographer, who writes on the north, "Les Iroquois du nord," and on tthe ſouth ſide, "Pays des Iroquois." Hennepin, la Hontan, and Deliſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e, all concur with Bellin, in extending the right of the ſive nations, to the lands on the north ſide of lake Ontario. The firſt of theſe, beſides what appears from his map, ſpeaking of that lake, has theſe words, "There are likewiſe on the north ſide, theſe Iroquois villages, Tejajahon, Kente, and Ganneouſſe;" every one of which is laid down even in Bellin's, and almoſt all the maps I have ſeen of that country whether French or Engliſh. What renders Hennepin's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the more remarkable, is, that theſe villages were there in 1679, ſeven years after the erection of fort Frontenac. From whence it may fairly be argued, that their not oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thoſe works, was by no means a ceſſion of the country to the French; and indeed Charlevoix himſelf repreſents that matter as carried on by a fraud, for, ſays he, "under pretext of ſeeking their advantage, the governor had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in view, <hi>que de les tenir en bride.</hi>"</p>
            <p>To theſe atteſtations, which are the more to be depended upon, becauſe they are given by the French writers, whoſe partiality leads them to conſine the five nations to contracted limits<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Bellin was engineer of the marine, and tells us, that Charlevoix performed his travels in this country, by order of the French court; that he was a man of attention and curioſity, and had a determined reſolution to collect all poſſible intelligence, which he deſigned to make public. To give the greater credit to the jeſuit's hiſtory and his own map, he adds, that Charlevoix was never without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments proper for a voyager, <hi>"partout la bouſſole a la main."</hi>
               </note>, we may add, that our Indians univerſally concur in the claim of all the lands, not ſold to the Engliſh, from the mouth of Sorel river, on the ſouth ſide of the lakes Erie and Ontario, on both ſides of the Ohio, till it falls into the Miſſiſſippi; and on the north ſide of thoſe lakes, that whole territory between the Outawais river and the lake Huron,

            <p>The Britiſh title to fort Frontenac, and the lands on the north-weſt ſide of Cadaracqui river, has of late been drawn into queſtion by ſome, who, from jealouſy, or other motives equally ſhameful, were bent upon finding fault with every meaſure planned by general Shirley. The advocates for the French claim, relied much on a late map of the middle Britiſh colonies, and two pamphlets publiſhed by Leves Evans.</p>
            <p>"The French," ſays he, "being in poſſeſſion of fort Frontenac, at the peace of Ryſwick, which they attained during their war with the confederates, gives them an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted title to the acquiſition of the north-weſt ſide of St. Lawrence river, from thence to their ſettlement at Montreal." The writer adds; "It was upon the faith and honour of king William's promiſe (by the fourth article of the treaty of Ryſwick) of not diſturbing the French king in the fire poſſeſſion of the kingdoms, countries, lands, or dominions he then enjoyed, that I ſaid the French had an undoubted title to their acquiſition of the north-weſt ſide of St. Lawrence river, from Frontenac to Montreal."</p>
            <p>Whether the treaty ought to be conſidered, as having any relation to this matter, is a queſtion which I ſhall not take upon me to determine. The map-maker ſuppoſes it to be applicable, and, for the preſent, I grant it. The XIIth article of this treaty is in theſe words: "The moſt chriſtian king ſhall reſtore to the king of Great-Britain, all countries, iſlands, forts, and colonies, whereſeoevr ſituated, which the Engliſh did poſſeſs before the declaration of the preſent war. And in like manner, the king of Great-Britain ſhall reſtore to the moſt chriſtian king, all countries, iſlands, forts, and colonies, whereſoever ſituated, which the French did poſſeſs before the ſaid declaration of war." If therefore the Britiſh ſubjects were in poſſeſſion of fort Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenac at the commencement of the war, the French, who attained it during its continuance, according to this treaty, ought to have ſurrendered it to the Britiſh crown.</p>
            <p>Whatever the French title to fort Frontenac might have been, antecedent to the year 1688, in which the iſland of
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:024800_0150_0FCD638D7932D668"/>Montreal was invaded by the ſive nations, it is certain, that it was then abandoned, and that the Indians entered it, and demoliſhed a great part of the works<note n="*" place="bottom">Le fort de Catarocouy étoit évacué &amp; ruiné. Charl.</note>. But the author of the map aſſirms, "that the Engliſh did not poſſeſs fort Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenac before the declaration of war terminated by the peace of Ryſwick." To which I reply, that the Indians acquired a title in 1688, either by conqueſt, or dereliction, or both: and that the crown of Great-Britain had a right to take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of their acquiſition, in virtue of its ſo vereignty over the five cantons. That they were our dependents, was ſtrongly and often infiſted upon by governor Dongan and lord HeHamont, and the point remained <hi>ſub judice,</hi> till the treaty of Utrecht. Then a deciſion was ſolemnly made in our favour, which looks back, as the determination of all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes do, at leaſt as far as the firſt riſe of the controverſy; poſterior to which, and prior to king William's war, his Indian ſubjects obtained the poſſeſſion of the fort in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note n="†" place="bottom">The five nations entered the fort in 1688, and the war againſt France was not proclaimed till May 1689.</note> Whence I think it may be fairly deduced, if we take the treaty of Ryſwick for our rule, that fort Frontenac, which was regained by the French during their war with us, ought to have been ſurrendered to the Britiſh crown. Every public tranſaction between the French and the five nations, without the participation of the government of Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, ſince the Indians were claimed as our dependents, is perhaps abſolutely void, and particularly the treaty of peace made between the Indians and the chevalier de Callieres, after the death of count Frontenac<note n="‡" place="bottom">Evans's map and firſt pamphlet, or analyſis, were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in the ſummer 1755, and that part in favour of the French claim to Frontenac, was attacked by two papers in the New York Mercury, in Jan. 1756. This occaſioned his publication of the ſecond pamphlet the next ſpring, in which he endeavours to ſupport his map. He was a man in low circumſtances, in his temper precipitate, of violent paſſions, great vanity, and rude manners. He pretended to the knowledge of every thing, and yet had very little learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

He piqued himſelf much upon his two maps, which are however juſtly chargeable with many errors. His ignorance of language is evident, both in them and the two pamphlets of his analyſis, the laſt of which is ſtuffed with groundleſs aſperſions on general Shirley, who deſerves ſo well from theſe colonies, that on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and to weaken the authority of a map prejudicial to his majeſty's rights, I beg the reader's excuſe for this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraction of the old rule, <hi>de mortuis nil niſi bonum.</hi> He died at New-York, June 12, 1756, under an arreſt for a groſs ſlander, uttered againſt mr.

The poſſeſſion of any part of the country of the five nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by the French, either before or ſince the cloſe of queen Anne's war, cannot prejudice the Britiſh title, becauſe the treaty of Aix la Chapelle renews and confirms that execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Utrecht in 1713, and expreſsly ſtipulates that the dominions of the contracting parties ſhall be in the ſame condition, "which they ought of right to have been in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the late war." Commiſſaries were ſoon after appointed to adjuſt the controverted limits, who accordingly met at Paris, and continued the negociation, till the French king perſidiouſly ſeized upon ſeveral parts of Nova-Scotia, or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadia, the ſettlement of the bounds of which, was part of the very buſineſs of the commiſſaries. This gave riſe to the preſent operations, and the longeſt ſword will determine the controverſy.</p>
            <p>Brigadier Hunter was diſappointed in his expectations upon the late diſſolution; for though the elections were very hot, and ſeveral new members came in, yet the majori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were in the intereſt of the late aſſembly, and on the 27th of May, 1713, choſe mr. Nicoll into the chair. The gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor ſpoke to them with great plainneſs, informing them, that it would be in vain to endeavour to lodge the money allotted for the ſupport of government, in any other than the hands of the queen's officers. "Nevertheleſs," ſays he, "if you are ſo reſolved, you may put the country to the expenſe of a treaſurer, for the cuſtody of money raiſed for extraordinary uſes." He added, that he was reſolved to paſs no law, till proviſion was made for the government. The members were therefore reduced to the dilemma of paſſing a bill for that purpoſe, or breaking up immediately. They choſe the former, and the governor gave his aſſent to that, and an exciſe bill on ſtrong liquors, which continues to this day, producing into the treaſury about one thouſand pounds per annum. After a ſhort receſs, ſeveral other laws
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:024800_0152_0FCD63911111B488"/>were enacted in the fall. But the debts of the government ſtill remained unnoticed, till the ſummer of the year 1714. A long ſeſſion was then almoſt entirely devoted to that ſingle affair. Incredible were the numbers of the public creditors. New demands were every day made. Petitions came in from all quarters, and even for debts contracted before the revolution. Their amount was near twenty eight thouſand pounds. To pay this prodigious ſum, recourſe was had to the circulation of bills of credit to that value. Theſe were lodged in the hands of the province treaſurer, and iſſued by him only, according to the directions of the act.</p>
            <p>The news of the queen's death arriving in the enſuing fall, a diſſolution enſued of courſe; and a new houſe met in May, 1715, which continued only to the 21ſt of July. For the governor being now determined to ſubdue thoſe, whom he could not allure, again diſſolved the aſſembly. He ſucceeded in his deſign, for though mr. Nicoll was re-elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the chair on the 9th of June, 1716, yet we plainly perceive, by the harmony introduced between the ſeveral branches of the legiſlature, that the majority of the houſe were now in the intereſt of the governor.</p>
            <p>An inconteſtible evidence of their good underſtanding, appeared at the ſeſſion in autumn, 1717, when the governor informed them of a memorial, which had been ſent home, reflecting upon his adminiſtration. The houſe immediately voted an addreſs to him, which was conceived in terms of the utmoſt reſpect, teſtifying their abhorrence of the memorial, as a falſe and malicious libel. It was ſuppoſed to be written by Mulford, a repreſentative for Suffolk county, who always oppoſed the meaſures that were taken to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the friendſhip of the five nations, and fooliſhly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected a ſcheme to cut them off. It was printed in England, and delivered to the members at the door of the houſe of commons, but never had the author's intended effect.</p>
            <p>It was at this meeting, the council, on the 31ſt of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſent a meſſage by mr. Alexander, then deputy ſecreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to the houſe, deſiring them "to appoint proper per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, for running the diviſion line between this colony and the province of New-Jerſey, his excellency being aſſured the legiſlature of the province of New-Jerſey will bear half the expenſe thereof." The aſſembly had a bill before them, at that time, which afterwards paſſed into a law, for the payment of the remaining debts of the government, amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to many thouſand pounds; in which, after a recital of
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:024800_0153_0FCD63928DF7F168"/>the general reaſons, for aſcertaining the limits between New-York and New-Jerſey on the one ſide, and Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut on the other, a clauſe was added, to defray the expenſe of thoſe ſervices. Seven hundred and fifty ounces of plate were enacted "to be iſſued by warrant, under the hand and ſeal of the governor of this province for the time being, by and with the advice and conſent of his majeſty's council, in ſuch parts and portions as ſhall be requiſite for that ſervice, when the ſurvey, aſcertaining, and running the ſaid line, limit, and boundary, ſhall be begun, and carried on, by the mutual conſent and agreement of his excellency and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of this province, and the proprietors of the ſoil of the ſaid province of New-Jerſey." According to this law, the line "agreed on by the ſurveyors and commiſſioners of each colony was to be concluſive." Another ſum was alſo provided by the ſame clauſe, for running the line between New-York and Connecticut; and in the year, 1719, an act was paſſed for the ſettlement of that limit, of which I ſhall have occaſion to take notice in a ſucceeding adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration.</p>
            <p>Whether it was becauſe mr. Nicoll was diſguſted with the governor's prevailing intereſt in the houſe, or to his infirm ſtate of health, that he deſired, by a letter to the general aſſembly, on the 18th of May, 1718, to be diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the ſpeaker's place, is uncertain. His requeſt was readily granted, and Robert Livingſton, <abbr>eſq</abbr> choſen in his ſtead. The concord between the governor and this aſſembly, was now wound up to its higheſt pitch. Inſtead of other evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of it, I ſhall lay before the reader his laſt ſpeech to the houſe on the 24th of June 1719, and their addreſs in anſwer to it.</p>

            <p>"But if the ſervice of our ſovereign will not admit of what we ſo earneſtly deſire, and his commands deny us that happineſs; permit us to addreſs you as our friend, and give

            <p>Colonel Hunter departing the province, the chief com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand devolved, the 31ſt of July, 1719, on Peter Schuyler, <abbr>eſq</abbr> then the eldeſt member of the board of council. As he had no interview with the aſſembly during his ſhort ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, in which he behaved with great moderation and integrity; there is very little obſervable in his time, except a treaty, at Albany, with the Indians, for confirming the antient league; and the tranſactions reſpecting the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition line between this and the colony of New-Jerſey: concerning the latter of which, I ſhall now lay before the reader a very ſummary account.</p>
            <p>The two provinces were originally included in the grant of king Charles to the duke of York. New-Jerſey was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards conveyed by the duke to lord Berkley and ſir George Carteret. This again, by adeed of partition, was divided into Eaſt and Weſt Jerſey, the former being releaſed to ſir George Carteret, and the latter to the aſſigns of lord Berkley. The line of diviſion extended from little Egg harbour to the north partition point on Delaware river; and thus both thoſe tracts became concerned in the limits of the province of New-York. The original rights of lord Berkley and ſir George Carteret, are veſted in two different ſets, conſiſting each of a great number of perſons, known by the general name of the proprietors of Eaſt and Weſt Jerſey, who, though they ſurrendered the powers of government to queen Anne, in the year 1702, ſtill retained their property in the ſoil. Theſe were the perſons intereſted againſt the claim of New-York. It is agreed on all ſides, that the deed to New-Jerſey is to be firſt ſatisfied, out of that great tract granted to the duke, and that the remainder is the right of New-York. The proprietors inſiſt upon extending their northern limits to a line drawn from the latitude of 41° 40′ on Delaware, to the latitude of 41°, on Hudſon's river; and allege, that before the year 1671, the latitude of 41°, was reputed to be fourteen miles to the northward of Tappan creek, part of thoſe lands being ſettled under New-Jerſey till 1684. They farther contend, that in 1684 or 1685, Dongan and Lawrie, (the former, governor of New-York, and the latter, of New-Jerſey), with their reſpective councils, agreed, that the latitude on Hudſon's river was at the mouth of Tappan creek, and that a line from thence to the latitude of 41° 40′ on Delaware ſhould be the boundary line. In 1686, Robin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:024800_0156_0FCD6398C5048FA8"/>Wells, and Keith,<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſame who left the quakers, and took orders in the church of England. Burnet's hiſt. of his own times.</note> ſurveyors of the three ſeveral pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, took two obſervations, and found the latitude of 41° to be 1′ and 25′ to the northward of the Yonker's mills, which is four miles and forty five chains to the ſouthward of the month of Tappan creek. But againſt theſe obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the proprietors offer ſundry objections, which it is not my buſineſs to enumerate. It is not pretended by any of the litigants, that a line, according to the ſtations ſettled by Dongan and Lawrie, was actually run; ſo that the limits of theſe contending provinces, muſt long have exiſted in the uncertain conjectures of the inhabitants of both; and yet the inconveniences of this unſettled ſtate, through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy of the country, were very inconſiderable. In the year 1701, an act paſſed in New-York, relating to elections, which annexed Wagachemeck, and great and little Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſink, certain ſettlements near Delaware, to Ulſter county. The intent of this law was to quiet diſputes before ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between the inhabitants of thoſe places, whoſe votes were required both in Orange and Ulſter. The natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion from hence is, that the legiſlature of New-York then deemed thoſe plantations not included within the New-Jerſey grant.</p>
            <p>Such was the ſtate of this affair till the year 1717, when proviſion was made by this province for running the line. The ſame being done in New-Jerſey the ſucceeding year, commiſſions for that purpoſe, under the great ſeals of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective colonies, were iſſued in May, 1719. The commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, by indenture dated the 25th of July, fixed the north ſtation point on the northermoſt branch of Delaware, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Fiſh-Kill; and from thence a random line was run to Hudſon's river, terminating about five miles to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the mouth of Tappan creek. In Auguſt, the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyors of Eaſt-Jerſey met for fixing the ſtation on Hudſon's river. All the commiſſioners not attending through ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nothing further was done. What had already been tranſacted, however, gave a general alarm to many perſons intereſted in ſeveral patents under New-York, who before imagined their rights extended to the ſouthward of the random line. The New-York ſurveyor afterwards declined proceeding in the work, complaining of faults in the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which had been uſed in fixing the north ſtation on Delaware. The proprietors, on the other hand, think they
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:024800_0157_0FCD639A0C4042D0"/>have anſwered his objections, and the matter reſted, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much contention, till the year 1740. Frequent quarrels multiplying after that period, relating to the rights of ſoil and juriſdiction ſouthward of the line in 1719, a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary act was paſſed in New-Jerſey, in February, 1748, for running the line <hi>ex parte,</hi> if the province of New-York refuſed to join in the work. Our aſſembly, ſoon after, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected their agent, to oppoſe the king's confirmation of that act; and it was accordingly dropped, agreeably to the advice of the lords of trade, whoſe report of the 18th of July, 1753, on a matter of ſo much importance, will doubtleſs be acceptable to the reader.</p>

                        <p>WE have lately had under our conſideration, an act paſſed in your majeſty's province of New-Jerſey in 1747-8, entitled, 'An act for running and aſcertaining the line of partition and diviſion betwixt this province of New-Jerſey, and the province of New-York.'</p>
                        <p>And having been attended by mr. Paris, ſolicitor in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the proprietors of the eaſtern diviſion of New-Jerſey—with mr. Hume Campbell, and mr. Henley, his counſel, in ſupport of the ſaid act—and by mr. Charles, agent for the province of New-York, with mr. Forreſter, and mr. Pratt, his counſel, againſt the ſaid act; and heard what each party had to offer thereupon; we beg leave humbly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to your majeſty, that the conſiderations which ariſe upon this act, are of two ſorts, viz. ſuch as relate to the principles upon which it is founded, and ſuch as relate to the tranſactions and circumſtances which accompany it.</p>
                        <p>As to the firſt; it is an act of the province of New-Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey, intereſted in the determination of the limits, and in the conſequential advantages to ariſe from it.</p>
                        <p>The province of New-Jerſey, in its diſtinct and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate capacity, can neither make nor eſtabliſh boundaries: it can as little preſcribe regulations for deciding differences between itſelf and other parties concerned in intereſt.</p>
                        <p>The eſtabliſhed limits of its juriſdiction and territory, are ſuch as the grants under which it claims have aſſigned. If thoſe grants are doubtful, and differences ariſe upon the conſtructions, or upon the matters of them, we humbly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that there are but two methods of deciding them; either by the concurrence of all parties concerned in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, or by the regular and legal forms of judicial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings:
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:024800_0158_0FCD639EB8CD7D18"/>and it appears to us, that the method of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding muſt be derived from the immediate authority of the crown itſelf, ſignified by a commiſſion from your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty under the great ſeal: the commiſſion of ſubordinate officers and of derivative powers being neither competent nor adequate to ſuch purpoſes: to judge otherwiſe would be, as we humbly conceive, to ſet up <hi>ex parte</hi> determinations and incompetent juriſdictions in the place of juſtice and legal authority.</p>
                        <p>If the act of New-Jerſey cannot conclude other parties, it cannot be effectual to the ends propoſed; and that it would not be effectual to form an abſolute deciſion in this caſe, the legiſlature of that province ſeems ſenſible, whilſt it endeavours to leave to your majeſty's determination, the deciſion of one point relative to this matter, and of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable importance to it; which power your majeſty can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not derive from them, without their having the power to eſtabliſh the thing itſelf, without the aſſiſtance of your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</p>
                        <p>As we are of opinion, that the preſent act, without the concurrence of other parties concerned in intereſt, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable and ineffectual; we ſhall, in the next place, conſider what tranſactions and proceedings have paſſed, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards obtaining ſuch concurrence.</p>
                        <p>The parties intereſted are your majeſty and the two provinces of New-York and New-Jerſey. Your majeſty is intereſted with reſpect to your ſovereignty, ſeigneurie, and property; and the ſaid provinces with reſpect to their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and juriſdiction.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the tranſactions on the part of New-York, we beg leave to obſerve, that whatever agreements have been made formerly between the two provinces for ſettling their boundaries; whatever acts of aſſembly have paſſed, and whatever commiſſions have been iſſued by the reſpective governors and governments; the proceedings under them have never been perfected, the work remains unfiniſhed, and the diſputes between the two provinces ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with as much contradiction as ever, but there is a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance that appears to us to have ſtill more weight, namely, that thoſe tranſactions were never properly war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted on the part of the crown: the crown never partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated in them, and therefore cannot be bound with reſpect to its intereſts by proceedings ſo authorized.</p>
                        <p>The intereſt, which your majeſty has in the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of this boundary, may be conſidered in three lights: either as intereſts of ſovereignty, reſpecting mere govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:024800_0159_0FCD63A05D183630"/>of ſeigneurie, which reſpect eſcheats, and quit-rents; or of property, as relative to the ſoil itſelf; which laſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, takes place in ſuch caſes, where either your majeſty has never made any grants of the ſoil, or where ſuch grants have by eſcheats reverted to your majeſty.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the firſt of theſe intereſts, viz. that of ſovereignty, it has been alleged to us, in ſupport of the act, that it is not materially affected by the queſtion, as both provinces are under your majeſty's immediate direction and government: but they ſtand in a very different light with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to your majeſty's intereſt in the quit-rents and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheats; in both which articles the ſituation of the two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces appears to us to make a very material alteration: for although the province of New-Jerſey is not under regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of propriety or charter with reſpect to its government, yet it is a proprietary province, with reſpect to the grant and tenure of its territory: and conſequently as New-York is not in that predicament, the determination of the bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in prejudice to that province, will affect your majeſty's intereſt with reſpect to the tenure of ſuch lands as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in this queſtion: it being evident, that whatever diſtricts are ſuppoſed to be included in the limits of New-Jerſey, will immediately paſs to the proprietors of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and be held of them, by which means your majeſty would be deprived of your eſcheats, and the quit-rents would paſs into other hands.</p>
                        <p>To obviate this objection, it has been alleged, that the crown has already made abſolute grants of the whole terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory that can poſſibly come in queſtion under the denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of this boundary, and reſerved only trifling and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable quit-rents on thoſe grants. But this argument does not ſeem to us to be concluſive, ſince it admits an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in your majeſty, the greatneſs or ſmallneſs of which is merely accidental; and therefore does not affect the eſſence of the queſtion: and we beg leave to obſerve, that in the caſe of exorbitant grants with inconſiderable quit-rents—and where conſequently it may reaſonably be ſuppoſed, that the crown has been deceived in ſuch grants by its officers; your majeſty's contingent right of property, in virtue of your ſeigneurie, ſeems rather to be enlarged than dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</p>
                        <p>This being the caſe, it appears to us, that governor Hanter ought not to have iſſued his commiſſion for running the line above mentioned, without having previouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the loyal direction and inſtruction for that purpoſe; and that a commiſſion, iſſued without ſuch authority, can
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:024800_0160_0FCD63A195B5ADA0"/>be conſidered, with reſpect to the intereſts of the crown, in no other light than as a mere nullity: and even with reſpect to New-York, we obſerve, that the ſaid commiſſion is queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable, as it does not follow the directions of the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned act, paſſed in 1717, which declares, that the commiſſion to be iſſued, ſhall be granted under the joint authority of the governor and council of that province.</p>
                        <p>But it has been further urged, that the crown has ſince confirmed theſe tranſactions, either by previous declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or by ſubſequent acquieſcence, and conſequently parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipated in them, ſo far as to conclude itſelf: we ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in the next place, beg leave to conſider the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances urged for this purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>It has been alleged, that the crown, by giving conſent to the aforeſaid act, paſſed in New-York in 1717, for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſcharging ſeveral debts due from that colony, &amp;c. concluded and bound itſelf, with reſpect to the ſubſequent proceedings had under the commiſſion iſſued by governor Hunter: but the view and purport of that act appears to us ſo entire, and ſo diſtinctly formed for the purpoſe of raiſing money and eſtabliſhing funds—ſo various and ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct from any conſideration of the diſputes ſubſiſting in the two provinces, with reſpect to the boundaries—that we cannot conceive a ſingle clauſe, in ſo long and ſo intricate an act, can be a ſufficient foundation to warrant the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of governor Hunter ſubſequent to it, without a ſpecial authority from the crown for that purpoſe: and there is the more reaſon to be of this opinion, as the crown, by giving its aſſent to that act, can be conſtrued to have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented only to the levying money for a future purpoſe; which purpoſe could not be effected by any commiſſion, but from itſelf; and therefore can never be ſuppoſed to have, thereby, approved a commiſſion from another authority, which was at that time already iſſued, and carrying in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, previous to ſuch aſſent.</p>
                        <p>We further beg leave humbly to repreſent to your majeſty, that the line of partition and diviſion between your majeſty's province of New-York and colony of Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticut, having been run and aſcertained, purſuant to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of an act, paſſed at New-York, for that purpoſe, in the year 1719, and confirmed by his late majeſty in 1723; the tranſactions between the ſaid province and colony, upon that occaſion, have been alleged to be ſimilar to, and urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as, a precedent, and even as an approbation, of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter now in queſtion: but we are humbly of opinion, that the two caſes are materially and eſſentially different. The
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:024800_0161_0FCD63A30C326FC0"/>act paſſed in New-York, in 1719, for running and aſcertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the lines of partition and diviſion between that colony and the colony of Connecticut, recites, that in the year 1683, the governor and council of New-York, and the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor and commiſſioners of Connecticut, did, in council, conclude an agreement concerning the boundaries of the two provinces; that, in conſequence of this agreement, commiſſioners and ſurveyors were appointed on the part of each government, who did actually agree, determine, and aſcertain, the lines of partition: marked out a certain part of them, and fixed the point from whence the remaining part ſhould be run: that the ſeveral things agreed on and done by the ſaid commiſſioners, were ratified by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective governors—entered on record in each colony, in March 1700—approved and confirmed by order of king William, the third, in his privy council—and by his ſaid majeſty's letter to his governor of New-York. From this recital it appears to us, that thoſe tranſactions were not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carried on with the participation, but confirmed by the expreſs act and authority of the crown; and that confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made the foundation of the act, paſſed by New-York, for ſettling the boundaries between the two provinces; of all which authority and foundation, the act, we now lay before your majeſty, appears to us to be entirely deſtitute.</p>
                        <p>Upon the whole, as it appears to us, that the act in queſtion, cannot be effectual to the ends propoſed—that your majeſty's intereſt may be materially affected by it— and that the proceedings, on which it is founded, were not warranted in the firſt inſtance, by the proper authority, but carried on without the participation of the crown; we cannot think it adviſable, to lay this act before your majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as fit to receive your royal approbation.</p>

            <p>WILLIAM BURNET, <abbr>eſq</abbr> took upon him the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this province, on the 17th of September, 1720. The council named in his inſtructions, were</p>

            <p>Mr. Burnet was a ſon of the celebrated biſhop of that name, whoſe piety and crudition, but eſpecially his zeal and activity, for the glorious revolution and proteſtant ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, will embalm his memory to the moſt diſtant ages. The governor was a man of ſenſe and polite breeding, a well-read ſcholar, ſprightly, and of a ſocial diſpoſition. Being devoted to his books, he abſtained from all thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, into which his pleaſurable reliſh would otherwiſe have plunged him. He ſtudied the arts of recommending himſelf to the people, had nothing of the moroſeneſs of a ſcholar, was gay and condeſcending, affected no pomp, but
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:024800_0163_0FCD63A990BA0350"/>viſited every family of reputation, and often diverted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in free converſe with the ladies, by whom he was very much admired. No governor, before him, did ſo much buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in chancery. The office of chancellor was his delight. He made a tolerable figure in the exerciſe of it, though he was no lawyer, and had a foible very unſuitable for a judge I mean his reſolving too ſpeedily, for he uſed to ſay of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, "I act firſt, and think afterwards." He ſpoke, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, always ſenſibly, and by his great reading was able to make a literary parade.—As to his fortune, it was very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable, for he ſuffered much in the ſouth ſea ſcheme. While in England, he had the office of comptroller of the cuſtoms at London, which he reſigned to brigadier Hunter, as the latter, in his favour, did the government of this and the colony of New-Jerſey. Mr. Burnet's acquaintance with that gentleman gave him a fine opportunity, before his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, to obtain good intelligence both of perſons and things. The brigadier recommended all his old friends to the favour of his ſucceſſor; and hence we find that he made few changes amongſt them.<note n="*" place="bottom">Colonel Schuyler and mr. Philipſe were, indeed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the council board, by his repreſentations; and their oppoſing, in council, the continuance of the aſſembly, after his arrival, was the cauſe of it.</note>. Mr. Morris, the chief juſtice, was his principal confidant. Dr. Colden and mr. Alexander, two Scotch gentlemen, had the next place in his eſteem. He ſhowed his wiſdom in that choice, for they were both men of learning, good morals, and ſolid parts. The former was well acquainted with the affairs of the province, and particularly thoſe which concerned the French in Canada and our Indian allies. The latter was bred to the law; and though no ſpeaker, at the head of his profeſſion for ſagaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and penetration; and in application to buſineſs) no man could ſurpaſs him. Nor was he unacquainted with the affairs of the public, having ſerved in the ſecretary's office, the beſt ſchool in the province, for inſtruction in matters of government; becauſe the ſecretary enjoys a plurality of offices, converſant with the firſt ſprings of our provincial economy. Both thoſe gentlemen mr. Burnet ſoon raiſed to the council board, as he alſo did mr. Morris, jun. mr. Van Horn, whoſe daughter he married, and mr. Kennedy, who ſucceeded Byerly, both at the council board, and in the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of receiver-general.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="169" facs="unknown:024800_0164_0FCD63AA8E8F2470"/>
Of all our governors, none had ſuch extenſive and juſt views of our Indian affairs, and the dangerous neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the French, as governor Burnet, in which mr. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingſton was his principal aſſiſtant. His attention to theſe matters appeared at the very commencement of his adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration; for in his firſt ſpeech to the aſſembly, the very fall after his arrival, he laboured to implant the ſame ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the breaſts of the members; endeavouring to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm their fears, by the daily advances of the French, their poſſeſſing the main paſſes, ſeducing our Indian allies, and encreaſing their new ſettlements in Louiſania.</p>
            <p>Chief juſtice Morris, whoſe influence was very great in the houſe, drew the addreſs in anſwer to the governor's ſpeech, which contained a pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>age manifeſting the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they repoſed in him. "We believe that the ſon of that worthy prelate, ſo eminently inſtrumental, under our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious monarch, William the third, in delivering us from arbitrary power, and its concomitants, popery, ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſlavery; has been educated in, and poſſeſſes, thoſe principles, that ſo juſtly recommended his father to the council and confidence of proteſtant princes; and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds our former governor, not only in power, but inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to do us good."</p>
            <p>From an aſſembly, impreſſed with ſuch favourable ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, his excellency had the higheſt reaſon, to expect a ſubmiſſive compliance, with every thing recommended to their notice. The public buſineſs proceeded without ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion or jealouſy, and nothing intervened to diſturb the tranquillity of the political ſtate. Among the moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able acts, paſſed at this ſeſſion, we may reckon that, for a five years ſupport; another for laying a duty of two per cent. prime coſt, on the importation of European goods, which was ſoon after repealed by the king; and a third, for prohibiting the ſale of Indian goods to the French. The laſt of theſe was a favourite act of the governor's, and though a law very advantageous to the province, became the ſource of an unreaſonable oppoſition againſt him, which continued through his whole adminiſtration. From the concluſion of the peace of Utrecht, a great trade was carried on between Albany and Canada, for goods ſaleable among the Indians. The chiefs of the confederates wiſely foreſaw its ill conſequences, and complained of it to the commiſſioners of Indian affairs<note n="*" place="bottom">The governor's reſiding at New York, rendered it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that ſome perſons ſhould be commiſſioned, at Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, to receive intelligence from the Indians, and treat with them upon emergencies. This gave riſe to the office of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of Indian affairs, who in general tranſact all ſuch matters as might be done by the governor. They receive no ſalaries, but conſiderable ſums are depoſited in their hands for occaſional preſents. There are regular minutes of their tranſactions from the year 1675. Theſe were in ſeparate quires, till mr. Alexander, who borrowed them for his peruſal in 1751, had them bound up in four large volumes in folio. Here all our Indian treaties are entered. The books are kept by a ſecretary, commiſſioned in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, whoſe appointment is an annual ſalary of one hundred pounds proclamation out of the quit-rents. The command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant at Oſwego is generally a commiſſioner. The office would probably have been more advantageous than it has been, if the commiſſioners were not traders themſelves, than which nothing is more ignoble in the judgment of the Indians. Sir William Johnſon is at preſent the ſole commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner, and within nine months after the arrival of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Braddock, received 10,000<abbr>l.</abbr> ſterling to ſecure the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an intereſt.</note>, who wrote to mr. Hunter,
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:024800_0165_0FCD63AC38501B70"/>acquainting him of their diſſatisfaction. The letter was laid before the houſe; but no effectual ſtep taken to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the miſchief, till the paſſing of this act, which ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the traders to a forfeiture of the effects ſold, and the penalty of one hundred pounds. Mr. Burnet's ſcheme was to draw the Indian trade into our own hands; to obſtruct the communication of the French with our allies, which gave them frequent opportunities of ſeducing them from their fidelity; and to regain the Caghnuagas, who became intereſted in their diſaffection, by being the carriers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Albany and Montreal. Among thoſe who were more immediately prejudiced by this new regulation, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters of thoſe goods, from Europe, were the chief; and hence the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>All poſſible arts were uſed, both here and at home, to preſerve the good temper of the aſſembly. Brigadier Hunter gave the miniſtry ſuch favourable accounts of the members, that colonel Schuyler, during his preſidentſhip, had orders from mr. ſecretary Craggs, neither to diſſolve them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, nor permit them to be diſſolved; and at the ſpring ſeſſion, in the year 1721, mr. Burnet informed them, that his continuance of them, was highly approved at home.
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:024800_0166_0FCD63AD8D15C6F8"/>Horatio Walpole, the auditor-general, who had appointed mr. Clarke for his deputy, thought this a favourable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture, for procuring five per cent. out of the treaſury. But the houſe was averſe to his application; and on the 2d of June, Abcaham Depeyſter, jun. was appointed trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer by the ſpeaker's warrant, with the conſent of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, in the room of his father, who was infirm; upon which he entered into a recognizance of 5000<abbr>l.</abbr> to the king, before a judge of the ſupreme court, for the faithful execution of his truſt, which was lodged in the ſecretary's office. The houſe at the ſame time, in an addreſs, declared their willingneſs that the treaſurer ſhould account; but utterly refuſed to admit of any drafts upon the treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for the auditor-general, who was conſtrained to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend entirely upon the revenue, out of which he received about 200<abbr>l.</abbr> per annum.</p>
            <p>Mr. Burnet being well acquainted with the geography of the country, wiſely concluded, that it was to the laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree neceſſary to get the command of the great lake Onta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio, as well for the benefit of the trade, and the ſecurity of the friendſhip of the five nations, as to fruſtrate the French deſigns, of confining the Engliſh colonies to narrow limits, along the ſea coaſt, by a chain of forts on the great paſſes from Canada to Louiſania. Towards the ſubverſion of this ſcheme, he began the erection of a trading houſe at Oſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, in the county of the Senecas, in 1722; and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended a proviſion for the reſidence of truſty perſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and the Onondagas, which laſt poſſeſs the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of the five cantons. This year was remarkable for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of ſeveral governors and commiſſioners, on the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of the ancient friendſhip with the Indians at Albany, Mr. Burnet prevailed upon them to ſend a meſſage, to threaten the eaſtern Indians with a war, unleſs they concluded a peace with the Engliſh, who were very much harraſſed by their frequent irruptions. On the 20th of May, in the year following, the confederates were augmented by their reception of above eighty Nicariagas, beſides women and children, as they had been formerly, by the addition of the Tuſcaroras. The country of the Nicariagas was on the north ſide of Miſſilimakinack; but the Tuſcaroras poſſeſſed a tract of land near the ſources of James's river, in Virginia, from whence the encroachments of the Engliſh induced them to remove, and ſettle near the ſouth-eaſt end of the Oneyda lake.</p>
            <p>The ſtrict union ſubſiſting, between the ſeveral branches of the legiſlature, gave a handle to mr. Burnet's enemies to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:024800_0167_0FCD63B2A55AAEE0"/>a clamour againſt him. Jealouſies were induſtriouſly ſown in the breaſts of the people. The continuance of an aſſembly, after the acceſſion of a new governor, was repreſented as an anti-conſtitutional project: and though the affairs of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic were conducted with wiſdom and ſpirit, many were ſo much impoſed upon, that a rupture between the governor and the aſſembly was thought to be abſolutely neceſſary for the weal and ſafety of the community. But this was not the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtratagem of thoſe who were diſaffected by the prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of the French trade. The London merchants were induced to petition the king for an order to his governor, prohibiting the revival of the act made againſt it, or the paſſing any new law of that tendency. The petition was referred to the board of trade, and backed before their lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, with ſuggeſtions of the moſt notorious falſehoods. The lords of trade prudently adviſed, that no ſuch direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould be ſent to mr. Burnet, till he had an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of anſwering the objections againſt the act. They were accordingly ſent over to him, and he laid them before his council. Dr. Colden and mr. Alexander exerted themſelves in a memorable report in anſwer to them, which drew upon them the reſentment of ſeveral merchants here, who had firſt excited the London petition, and laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for a variance between their families, which has manifeſted itſelf on many occaſions. In juſtice to mr. Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not's memory, and to ſhow the propriety of his meaſures for obſtructing the French trade, I cannot refrain the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publication of the council's report at full length.</p>

                        <p>IN obedience to your excellency's commands, in council, the 29th of October, referring to us a petition of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral merchants in London, preſented to the king's moſt excellent majeſty, againſt renewing an act paſſed in this province, entitled, "An act for encouragement of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian trade, and rendering it more effectual to the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of this province, and for prohibiting the ſelling of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian goods to the French:" as likewiſe the ſeveral allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſaid merchants before the right honourable the lords of trade and plantations, we beg leave to make the following remarks.</p>
                        <p>In order to make our obſervations the more diſtinct and clear, we ſhall gather together the ſeveral aſſertions of the ſaid merchants, both in their petition, and delivered ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bally before the lords of trade, as to the ſituation of this province, with reſpect to the French and Indian nations;
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:024800_0168_0FCD63B38D0B91B0"/>and obſerve on them, in the firſt place, they being the foundation on which all their other allegations are ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Afterwards we ſhall lay before your excellency, what we think neceſſary to obſerve, on the other parts of the ſaid petition, in the order they are in the petition, or in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the lords of trade.</p>
                        <p>In their geographical accounts they ſay, "Beſides the nations of Indians that are in the Engliſh intereſt, there are very many nations of Indians, who are at preſent in the intereſt of the French, and who lie between New York and the nations of Indians in the Engliſh intereſt. The French and their Indians would not permit the Engliſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians to paſs over by their forts." The ſaid act "reſtrains them (the five nations) from a free commerce with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of New York."</p>
                        <p>The five Indian nations are ſettled upon the banks of the river St. Lawrence, directly oppoſite to Quebec, two or three hundred leagues diſtant from the neareſt Britiſh ſettlements in New York."</p>
                        <p>They (the five nations of Indians) were two or three hundred leagues diſtant from Albany; and that they could not come to trade with the Engliſh, but by going down the river St. Lawrence, and from thence through a lake, which brought them within eighteen leagues of Albany."</p>
                        <p>Theſe things the merchants have thought it ſafe for them, and conſiſtent with their duty to his ſacred majeſty, to ſay in his majeſty's preſence, and to repeat them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards before the right honourable the lords of trade, though nothing can be more directly contrary to the truth. For there are no nations of Indians between New York and the nations of Indians in the Engliſh intereſt, who are now ſix in number, by the addition of the Tuſcaroras. The Mohawks (called Annies<note n="*" place="bottom">Agnies.</note> by the French) one of the five nations, live on the ſouth ſide of a branch of Hudſon's ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, (not on the north ſide, as they are placed in the French maps) and but forty miles directly weſt from Albany, and within the Engliſh ſettlements; ſome of the Engliſh farms, upon the ſame river, being thirty miles further weſt. The Oneydas (the next of the five nations) lie like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe weſt from Albany, near the head of the Mohawk's ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, about one hundred miles from Albany. The Ononda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gas lie about one hundred and thirty miles weſt from Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany; and the Tuſcaroras live partly with the Oneydas, and
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:024800_0169_0FCD63B50D47D378"/>partly with the Onondagas.<note n="*" place="bottom">De L'Iſle.</note>. The Cayugas are about one hundred and ſixty miles from Albany; and the Senecas, (the furtheſt of all theſe nations,) are not above two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and forty miles from Albany, as may appear from mr. de L'Iſle's map of Louiſania, who lays down the five nations under the name of Iroquois: and goods are daily carried, from this province, to the Senecas, as well as to thoſe nations that lie nearer, by water, all the way, except three miles (or, in the dry ſeaſons, five miles) where the traders carry over land between the Mohawk's river and the Wood creek, which runs into the Oneyda's lake, without going near either St. Lawrenceriver, or any of the lakes upon which the French paſs, which are entirely out of their way.</p>
                        <p>The neareſt French forts, or ſettlements, to Albany, are Chambly, and Montreal, both of them lying about north and by eaſt from Albany, and are near two hundred miles diſtant from it. Quebec lies about three hundred and eighty miles north-eaſt from Albany. So far is it from being true, that the five nations are ſituated upon the banks of the river St. Lawrence, oppoſite to Quebec, that Albany lies almoſt directly between Quebec and the five nations. And to ſay that theſe Indians cannot come to trade at Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany, but by going down the river St. Lawrence, and then into a lake eighteen leagues from Albany (we ſuppoſe they mean lake Champlain) paſſing by the French forts, is to the ſame purpoſe as if they ſhould ſay, that one cannot go from London to Briſtol, but way of Edinburgh.</p>
                        <p>Before we go on to obſerve other particulars, we beg leave further to remark, that it is ſo far from being true, that the Indians in the French intereſt, lie between New-York and our five nations of Indians; that ſome of our nations of Indians lie between the French and the Indians, from whence the French bring the far greateſt quantity of their furs: for the Senecas (whom the French call Sonon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touons<note n="†" place="bottom">Iſonnontouans.</note>) are ſituated between lake Erie and Cadaracqui lake, (called by the French, Ontario) near the great fall of Iagara<note n="‡" place="bottom">Sometimes Oniagara, Ochniagara, but commonly Nia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gara.</note>, by which all the Indians that live round lake Erie, round the lake of the Hurons, round the lake of the Illinois, or Michegan, and round the great upper lake,
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:024800_0170_0FCD63B68E749790"/>generally paſs in their way to Canada. All the Indians ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated upon the branches of the Miſſiſſippi, muſt likewiſe paſs by the ſame place, if they go to Canada. And all of them, likewiſe, in their way to Canada, paſs by our trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-place upon the Cadaracqui lake, at the mouth of the Onondaga river. The neareſt and ſafeſt way of carrying goods upon the Cadaracqui lake, towards Canada, being along the ſouth ſide of that lake, (near where our Indians are ſettled, and our trade of late is fixed) and not by the north ſide and Cadaracqui, or Frontenac fort, where the French are ſettled.</p>
                        <p>Now that we have repreſented to your excellency, that not one word of the geography of theſe merchants is true, upon which all their reaſoning is founded; it might ſeem needleſs to trouble your excellency with any further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, were it not to ſhow with what earneſtneſs they are promoting the French intereſt, to the prejudice of all his majeſty's colonies in North-America, and that they are not aſhamed of aſſerting any thing for that end, even in the royal preſence.</p>
                        <p>Firſt they ſay, "That by the act paſſed in this province, entitled, 'An act for the encouragement of the Indian trade, &amp;c.' all trade whatſoever is prohibited in the ſtricteſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and under the ſevereſt penalties, between the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of New-York government, and the French of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada."</p>
                        <p>This is not true; for only carrying goods to the French, which are proper for the Indian trade, is prohibited. The trade, as to other things, is left in the ſame ſtate it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that act was made, as it will appear to any perſon that ſhall read it: and there are, yearly, large quantities of other goods, openly, carried to Canada, without any hindrance from the government of New-York. Whatever may be ſaid of the ſeverity and penalties in that act, they are found in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient to deter ſome from carrying goods clandeſtinely to the French; and the legiſlature of this province are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that no penalties can be too ſevere, to prevent a trade, which puts the ſafety of all his majeſty's ſubjects of North America in the greateſt danger.</p>
                        <p>Their next aſſertion is, "All the Indian goods have by this act been raiſed 25<abbr>l.</abbr> to 30<abbr>l.</abbr> per cent." This is the only allegation in the whole petition that there is any ground for. Nevertheleſs, though the common channel of trade cannot be altered without ſome detriment to it in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; we are aſſured from the cuſtom-houſe books, that there has been every year, ſince the paſſing of this act, more
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:024800_0171_0FCD63BB13DB6B78"/>furs exported from New-York, than in the year immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately before the paſſing of this act. It is not probable that the greateſt difference between the exportation, any year before this act, and any year ſince, could ſo much alter the price of beaver, as it is found to be this laſt year. Beaver is carried to Britain from other parts beſides New-York, and it is certain that the price of beaver is not ſo much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered here by the quantity in our market, as by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for it in Britain. But as we cannot be ſo well inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here, what occaſions beaver to be in greater demand in Britain, we muſt leave that to be enquired after in England. However, we are fully ſatisfied, that it will be found to be for very different reaſons from what the merchants allege.</p>
                        <p>The merchants go on and ſay, "Whereas, on the other hand, this branch of the New-York trade, by the diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agements brought upon it by this act, is almoſt wholly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed by the French, who have already by this act, been encouraged to ſend proper European goods to Canada, to carry on this trade, ſo that ſhould this act be continued, the New-York trade, which is very conſiderable, muſt be wholly loſt to us, and centre in the French.—Though New-York ſhould not furniſh them, the French would find an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other way to be ſupplied therewith, either from ſome other of his majeſty's plantations, or, it might be, directly from Europe.—Many of the goods, which the Indians want, being as eaſy to be had directly from France or Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, as from Great-Britain."</p>
                        <p>This is eaſily anſwered, by informing your excellency, that the principal of the goods proper for the Indian mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, are only of the manufactures of Great-Britain, or of the Britiſh plantations, viz. ſtrouds, or ſtroud-waters, and other woolens, and rum.—The French muſt be obliged to buy all their woolens (the ſtrouds eſpecially) in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and thence carry them to France, in order to their tranſportation to Canada.</p>
                        <p>The voyage to Quebec, through the bay of St. Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, is well known to be the moſt dangerous of any in the world, and only practicable in the ſummer months. The French have no commodities in Canada, by reaſon of the cold and barrenneſs of the ſoil, proper for the Weſt India markets; and therefore have no rum but by veſſels from France, that touch at their iſlands in the Weſt Indies. New-York has, by reaſon of its ſituation, both as to the ſea and the Indians, every way the advantage of Canada. The New-York veſſels make always two voyages in a year from Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, one in ſummer, and another in winter, and ſeveral
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:024800_0172_0FCD63BC917CEDC0"/>voyages in a year to the Weſt-Indies. It is manifeſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that it is not in the power of the French to import any goods near ſo cheap, to Canada, as they are imported to New-York.</p>
                        <p>But to put this out of all controverſy, we need only obſerve to your excellency, that ſtrouds (without which no conſiderable trade can be carried on with the Indians) are ſold at Albany for 10<abbr>l.</abbr> a piece: they were ſold at Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treal, before this act took place, at 13<abbr>l.</abbr> 2<abbr>s.</abbr> 6<abbr>d.</abbr> and now they are ſold there for 25<abbr>l.</abbr> and upwards; which is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent proof, that the French have not, in theſe four years time, (during the continuance of this act) found out any other way to ſupply themſelves with ſtrouds; and likewiſe that they cannot trade without them, ſeeing they buy them at ſo extravagant a price.</p>
                        <p>It likewiſe appears, that none of the neighbouring co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies have been able to ſupply the French with theſe goods; and thoſe, that know the geography of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, know it is impracticable to do it at any tolerable rate, becauſe they muſt carry their goods ten times further by land than we need to do.</p>
                        <p>We are likewiſe aſſured, that the merchants of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treal lately told mr. Vaudreuil, their governor, that if the trade from Albany be not by ſome mean or other encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged, they muſt abandon that ſettlement. We have reaſon, therefore, to ſuſpect, that theſe merchants (at leaſt ſome of them) have been practiſed upon by the French agents in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don: for no doubt, the French will leave no method un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tried to defeat the preſent deſigns of this government, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are more afraid of the conſequences of this trade between New-York and the Indians, than of all the warlike expeditions that ever were attempted againſt Canada.</p>
                        <p>But to return to the petitioners. "They conceive nothing can tend more to the withdrawing the affections of the five nations of Indians from the Engliſh intereſt, than the continuance of the ſaid act, which in its effects reſtrains them from a free commerce with the inhabitants of New-York, and may too probably eſtrange them from the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh intereſt; whereas, by a freedom of commerce, and an encouraged intercourſe of trade with the French and their Indians, the Engliſh intereſt might, in time, be greatly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and ſtrengthened."</p>
                        <p>It ſeems to us a ſtrange argument to ſay, that an act, the whole purport of which is to encourage our own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to go among the Indians, and to draw the far Indians through our Indian country to Albany (and which has truly
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:024800_0173_0FCD63BFB41469A8"/>produced theſe effects) would, on the contrary, reſtrain them from a free commerce with the inhabitants of New-York, and may too probably eſtrange them from the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh intereſt; and therefore that it would be much wiſer in us, to make uſe of the French, to promote the Engliſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; and for which end, we ought to encourage a free intercourſe between them and our Indians. The reverſe of this is exactly true, in the opinion of our five nations; who, in all their public treaties with this government, have repreſented againſt this trade, as the building the French forts with Engliſh ſtrouds: that the encouraging a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of commerce with our Indians and the Indians round them, who muſt paſs through their country to Albany, would certainly increaſe both the Engliſh intereſt and theirs, among all the nations to the weſtward of them; and that the carrying the Indian market to Montreal in Canada, draws all the far Indians thither.</p>
                        <p>The laſt thing we have to take notice of, is what the merchants aſſerted before the lords of trade, viz. "That there has not been half the quantity of European goods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported ſince the paſſing of this act, that uſed to be."—'We are well aſſured, that this is no better grounded than the above facts they aſſert with the ſame poſitiveneſs. For it is well known, almoſt to every perſon in New-York, that there has not been a leſs, but rather a greater quantity of European goods imported into this place, ſince the paſſing of this act, than was at any time before it, in the ſame ſpace of time. As this appears by the manifeſts in the cuſtom-houſe here, the ſame may likewiſe be eaſily proved by the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom-houſe books in London.</p>
                        <p>As all the arguments of the merchants run upon the ill effects this act has had upon the trade and the minds of the Indians, every one of which we have ſhown to be aſſerted, without the leaſt foundation to ſupport them; there nothing now remains, but to ſhow the good effects this act has produced, which are ſo notorious in this province, that we know not one perſon that now opens his mouth againſt the act.</p>
                        <p>Before this act paſſed, none of the people of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince travelled into the Indian countries to trade. We have now above forty young men, who have been ſeveral times as far as the lakes a trading, and thereby become well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not only with the trade of the Indians, but likewiſe with their manners and languages; and thoſe have returned with ſuch large quantities of furs, that greater numbers are reſolved to follow their example; ſo that we have good
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:024800_0174_0FCD63BE10A0C278"/>reaſon to hope, that in a little time, the Engliſh will draw the whole Indian trade of the inland countries to Albany, and into the country of the five nations. This government has built a public trading houſe upon Cadaracqui lake, at Irondequat in the Senecas land, and another is to be built, next ſpring, at the mouth of the Onondagas river. All the far Indians paſs by theſe places, in their way to Canada; and they are not above half ſo far from the Engliſh ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as they are from the French.</p>
                        <p>So far is it from being true what the merchants ſay, "That the French ſorts interrupt all communication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Indians and the Engliſh;" that if theſe places be well ſupported, as they eaſily can be from our ſettlements, in caſe of a rupture with the French, it will be in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of this province, to intercept the greateſt part of the trade between Canada and the Indians round the lakes and the branches of the Miſſiſſippi.—Since this act paſſed, many nations have come to Albany to trade, and peace and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, whoſe names had not ſo much as been heard of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us.—In the beginning of May, 1723, a nation of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians came to Albany, ſinging and dancing, with their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumets before them, as they always do when they come to any place, where they have not been before. We do not find that the commiſſioners of Indian affairs, were able to inform themſelves what nation this was.</p>
                        <p>Towards the end of the ſame month, eighty men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the women and children, came to Albany in the ſame manner. Theſe had one of our five nations with them for an interpreter, by whom they informed the commiſſioners, that they were of a great nation, called Nehkereages, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of ſix caſtles and tribes; and that they lived near a place called by the French, Miſſimakinah, between the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per lake and the lake of the Hurons. Theſe Indians not only deſired a free commerce, but likewiſe to enter into a ſtrict league of friendſhip with us and our ſix nations, that they might be accounted the ſeventh nation in the league: and being received accordingly, they left their calumet as a pledge of their fidelity. In June, another nation ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, but from what part of the continent we have not learned.</p>
                        <p>In July, the Twightwies arrived, and brought an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian interpreter of our nations with them, who told, that they were called by the French Miamies, and that they live upon one of the branches of the river Miſſiſſippi.—At the ſame time, ſome of the Tahſagrondie Indians, who live be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween lake Erie and the lake Hurons, near a French ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:024800_0175_0FCD63C48ABA6620"/>did come and renew their league with the Engliſh, nor durſt the French hinder them.—In July this year, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other nation came, whoſe ſituation and name we know not; and in Auguſt and September, ſeveral parties of the ſame Indians, that had been here laſt year: but the greateſt numbers of theſe far Indians have been met this year in the Indian country by our traders, every one of them endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to get before another, in order to reap the profits of ſo advantageous a trade, which has all this ſummer long, kept about forty traders conſtantly employed, in going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our trading-places, in our Indian country, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany.</p>
                        <p>All theſe nations of Indians, who came to Albany, ſaid, that the French had told them many ſtrange ſtories of the Engliſh, and did what they could, to hinder their coming to Albany; but that they had reſolved to break through by force. The difference on this ſcore between the Tahſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grondie Indians and the French (who have a fort and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement there, called by them le Detroit) roſe to that height, this ſummer, that mr. Tonti, who commanded there, thought it proper to retire, and return to Canada with many of his men.</p>
                        <p>We are, for theſe reaſons, well aſſured, that this year there will be more beaver exported for Great Britain, than ever was from this province in one year; and that if the cuſtom-houſe books at London be looked into, it will be found, that there will be a far greater quantity of goods for the Indians (ſtrouds eſpecially) ſent over next ſpring, than ever was at any one time to this province. For the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants here tell us, that they have at this time ordered more of theſe goods, than ever was done at any one time before.</p>
                        <p>Theſe matters of fact prove, beyond contradiction, that this act has been of the greateſt ſervice to New-York, in making us acquainted with many nations of Indians, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly entirely unknown, and ſtrangers, to us; withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them from their dependence upon the French, and in uniting them to us and our Indians, by means of trade and mutual offices of friendſhip.—Of what great conſequence this may be to the Britiſh intereſt in general, as to trade, is apparent to any body. It is no leſs apparent, likewiſe, that it is of the greateſt conſequence to the ſafety of all the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh colonies in North America. We feel, too ſenſibly, the ill effects of the French intereſt in the preſent war betwixt New England, and only one nation of Indians ſupported by the French. Of what diſmal conſequences then might it be, if the French ſhould be able to influence, in the ſame
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:024800_0176_0FCD63C5903F0AD8"/>manner, ſo many and ſuch numerous nations, as lie to the weſtward of this province, Pennſylvania, and Maryland? On the other hand, if all theſe nations (who aſſert their own freedom, and declare themſelves friends to thoſe that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them beſt with what they want) be brought to have a dependence upon the Engliſh (as we have good reaſon to hope in a ſhort time they will) the French of Canada, in caſe of a war, muſt be at the mercy of the Engliſh.</p>
                        <p>To theſe advantages muſt be added, that many of our young men having been induced by this act to travel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Indians, they learn their manners, their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, and the ſituation of all their countries, and become inured to all manner of fatigues and hardſhips: and a great many more being reſolved to follow their example, theſe young men, in caſe of war with the Indians, will be of ten times the ſervice, that the ſame number of the common mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia can be of.—The effects of this act have likewiſe ſo much quieted the minds of the people, with reſpect to the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the frontiers, that our ſettlements are now extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above thirty miles further weſt towards the Indian coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, than they were before it paſſed.</p>
                        <p>The only thing that now remains to anſwer, is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection which we ſuppoſe may be made, what can induce the merchants of London to petition againſt an act, which will be really ſo much for their intereſt in the end? The reaſon is, in all probability, becauſe they only conſider their preſent gain; and that they are not at all concerned for the ſafety of this country, in encouraging the moſt neceſſary undertaking, if they apprehend their profit for two or three years may be leſſened by it. This inclination of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants has been ſo notorious, that few nations at war with their neighbours, have been able to reſtrain them from ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying their enemies with ammunition and arms. The count d'Eſtrade, in his letters in 1638, ſays, that when the Dutch were beſieging Antwerp, one Beiland, who had load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed four fly-boats with arms and powder for Antwerp, being taken up by the prince of Orange's order, and examined at Amſterdam, ſaid boldly, that the burghers of Amſterdam had a right to trade every where: that he could name a hundred that were factors for the merchants at Antwerp, and that he was one. "That trade cannot be interrupted, and that for his part he was very free to own, that if to get any thing by trade, it were neceſſary to paſs through hell, he would venture to burn his ſails." 'When this principle, ſo common to merchants, is conſidered, and that ſome in
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:024800_0177_0FCD63C752A44B08"/>this place have got eſtates by trading many years to Canada, it is not to be wondered, that they have acted as factors for Canada in this affair, and that they have tranſmitted ſuch accounts to their correſpondents in London, as are conſiſtent with the truſt repoſed in them by the merchants of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada.</p>
                        <p>In the laſt place, we are humbly of opinion, that it may be proper to print the petition of the merchants of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and their allegations before the lords of trade, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the anſwers your committee has made thereto, in vindication of the legiſlature of this province, of which we have the honour to be a part, if your excellency ſhall approve of our anſwers; that what we have ſaid may be expoſed to the examination of every one in this place, where the truth of the matters of fact is beſt known, and that the correſpondents of theſe merchants may have the moſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic notice to reply, if they ſhall think it proper, or to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own, in a public manner, that they are the authors of ſuch groundleſs informations.

            <p>Governor Burnet tranſmitted this report to the board of trade; and it had the intended effect. About the latter end of the year 1724, and unfortunate diſpute commenced in the French church, of which, becauſe it had no ſmall influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on the public affairs of the government, I ſhall lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reader a ſhort account.</p>
            <p>The perſecutions in France, which enſued upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of the edict of Nantz, drove the proteſtant ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Louis XIV. into the territories of other princes. Many of them fled even into this province: the moſt opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſettled in the city of New-York; others went into the country, and planted New Rochelle; and a few ſeated themſelves at the New Paltz in Ulſter county. Thoſe, who reſided in New-York, ſoon erected a church, upon the principles and model of that in Geneva; and by their growth and foreign acceſſions, formed a congregation, for numbers and riches, ſuperior to all but the Dutch. They had two miniſters; Rou, the firſt called, was a man of
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:024800_0178_0FCD63C89FB032A8"/>learning, but proud, pleaſurable, and paſſionate. Mouli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naars, his colleague, was moſt diſtinguiſhed for his pacific ſpirit, dull parts, and unblameable life and converſation. Rou deſpiſed his fellow labourer, and, for a long time, commanded the whole congregation, by the ſuperiority of his talents for the pulpit. The other, impatient of repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed affronts and open contempt, raiſed a party in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and this year ſucceeded in the election of a ſet of el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, diſpoſed to humble the delinquent. Rou, being ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious of the deſign, refuſed to acknowledge them duly elected. Incenſed at this conduct, they entered an act in their minutes, diſmiſſing him from the paſtoral charge of the church, and procured a ratification of the act under the hands of the majority of the people. Governor Burnet had, long before this time, admitted Rou into his familiarity, on the ſcore of his learning: and that conſideration encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a petition to him, from Rou's adherents, complaining a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the elders. The matter was then referred to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the council, who adviſed that the congregation ſhould be admoniſhed, to bring their differences to an ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable concluſion. Some overtures, to that end, were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted; and the elders offered to ſubmit the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy to the Dutch miniſters. But Rou, who knew that the French church in this country, without a ſynod was unor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized, and could not reſtrain him, choſe rather to bring his bill in chancery before the governor.</p>
            <p>Mr. Alexander was his council; and mr. Smith<note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe gentlemen came into the colony in the ſame ſhip in 1715. The latter was born at Newport Pagnel, in Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inghamſhire. They were among the principal agents in the political ſtruggles during the adminiſtration of col. Coſby.</note>, a young lawyer, of the firſt reputation as a ſpeaker, appeared for the elders. He pleaded to the juriſdiction of the court, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting that the matter was entirely eccleſiaſtical, and, in the proſecution of his argument, entered largely into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of the government of the proteſtant churches in France. According to which, he ſhowed, that the conſiſtory were the proper judges of the point in diſpute, in the firſt inſtance; and that from thence an appeal lay to a collogue, next to a provincial, and laſt of all to a national ſynod. Mr. Burnet nevertheleſs over-ruled the plea; and the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, being fearful of a decree, that might expoſe their own eſtates to the payment of Rou's ſalary, thought it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeable
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:024800_0179_0FCD57FB364186C0"/>to drop their debates, reinſtate the miniſter, and leave the church.</p>
            <p>All thoſe, who oppoſed Rou, were diſobliged with the governor: among theſe mr. de Lancey was the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable for his wealth and popular influence. He was very rigid in his religious profeſſion, one of the firſt builders, and by far the moſt generous benefactor, of the French church; and therefore left it with the utmoſt reluctance. Mr. Burnet, before this time, had conſidered him as his enemy, becauſe he had oppoſed the prohibition of the French trade; and this led him into a ſtep, which, as it was a perſonal indignity, mr. de Lancey could never recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect without reſentment. This gentleman was returned for the city of New-York, in the room of a deceaſed member, at the meeting of the aſſembly in September 1725. When he offered himſelf for the oaths, mr. Burnet aſked him how he became a ſubject of the crown? He anſwered, that he was denizened in England: and his excellency diſmiſſed him, taking time to conſider the matter. Mr. de Lancey then laid before the houſe an act of a notary public, certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying that he was named in a patent of denization, grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the reign of James the ſecond—a patent of the ſame kind, under the great ſeal of this province, in 1686—and two certificates, one of his having taken the oath of alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, according to an act paſſed here in 1683, and another of his ſerving in ſeveral former aſſemblies. The governor, in the mean time, conſulted the chief juſtice, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his opinion<note n="*" place="bottom">What colonel Morris's opinion was, I have not been able to diſcover. Governor Burnet's conduct was thought to be unconſtitutional, and an invaſion of the rights of the aſſembly, who claim the excluſive privilege of determining the qualifications of their own members.</note> to the houſe, who reſolved in favour of mr. de Lancey. Several other new repreſentatives came in, at this ſeſſion, upon the deceaſe of the old members; and Adolph Philipſe, who was ſometime before diſmiſſed from the council board, was elected into the ſpeaker's chair, in the abſence of mr. Livingſton. The majority, however, continued in the intereſt of the governor; and conſented to the revival of the ſeveral acts, which had been paſſed for prohibiting the French trade; which, in ſpite of all the reſtraints laid upon it, was clandeſtinely carried on by the people of Albany. Oſwego, nevertheleſs, grew
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:024800_0180_0FCD63CE31D57A10"/>conſiderable for its commerce: fifty-ſeven canoes went there this ſummer, and returned with ſeven hundred and thirty-eight packs of beaver and deer ſkins.</p>
            <p>Nothing could more naturally excite the jealouſy of the French, than the erection of the new trading houſe at the mouth of the Onondaga river. Fearful of loſing a profitable trade, which they had almoſt entirely engroſſed, and the command of the lake Ontario, they launched two veſſels in it in 1726, and tranſported materials, for building a large ſtore-houſe, and repairing the fort at Niagara. The ſcheme was not only to ſecure to themſelves the entrance into the weſt end of the lake, as they already had the eaſt, by the fraudulent erection of ſort Frontenac, many years before; but alſo to carry their trade more weſterly, and thus render Oſwego uſeleſs, by ſhortening the travels of the weſtern Indians, near two hundred miles. Baron de Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiel, who had the chief command in Canada, on the death of the marquis de Vaudreuil, in October 1725, was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent upon this project, that he went, in perſon, to the On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ondaga canton, for leave to raiſe the ſtore-houſe at Nia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gara: and as thoſe Indians were moſt of all expoſed to the intrigues of the jeſuits, who conſtantly reſided amongſt them, he prevailed upon them by fraud and falſe repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations, to conſent to it, for their protection againſt the Engliſh. But as ſoon as this matter was made known to the other nations, they declared the permiſſion granted by the Onondagas to be abſolutely void; and ſent deputies to Nia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gara, with a meſſage, ſignifying that the country, in which they were at work, belonged ſolely to the Senecas; and required them immediately to deſiſt. The French, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, were regardleſs of the embaſſage, and puſhed on their enterpriſe with all poſſible diſpatch, while Joncaire exerted all his addreſs among the Indians, to prevent the demolition of the works. Canada was very much indebted to the inceſſant intrigues of this man. He had been adopted by the Senecas, and was well eſteemed by the Onondagas. He ſpoke the Indian language, as Charlevoix informs us, "avec la plus ſublime eloquence Iroquoiſe," and had lived amongſt them, after their manner, from the beginning of queen Anne's reign. All theſe advantages he improved for the intereſt of his country; he facilitated the miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in their progreſs through the cantons, and more than any man contributed to render their dependence upon the Engliſh, weak and precarious. Convinced of this, colonel Schuyler urged the Indians, at his treaty with them, in
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:024800_0181_0FCD63CF5AEB8E48"/>1719, to drive Joncaire out of their country; but his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours were fruitleſs<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſame thing has ſince been frequently laboured, but to no purpoſe. His ſon continued the courſe of intrigues begun by the father, till general Shirley, while he was at Oſwego in 1755, prevailed upon the Senecas to order him to Canada.</note>.</p>
            <p>The jeſuit Charlevoix does honour to mr. Burnet, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that he left no ſtone unturned, to defeat the French deſigns at Niagara. Nor is it much to be wondered at. For beſides ſupplanting his favourite trade at Oſwego, it tended to the defection of the five nations; and in caſe of a rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, expoſed the frontiers of our ſouthern colonies to the ravages of the French and their allies. Mr. Burnet, upon whom theſe conſiderations made the deepeſt impreſſion, laid the matter before the houſe—remonſtrated againſt the proceedings to Longuiel in Canada—wrote to the miniſtry in England, who complained of them to the French court—and met the confederates at Albany, endeavouring to convince them of the danger they, themſelves, would be in, from an aſpiring, ambitious neighbour. He ſpoke firſt about the affair, privately to the ſachems, and afterwards, in the public conference, informed them of all the encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which the French had made upon their fathers, and the ill uſage they had met with, according to la Potherie's account, publiſhed with the privilege of the French king, at Paris, in 1722. He then reminded them of the kind treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they had received from the Engliſh, who conſtantly fed and cloathed them, and never attempted any act of hoſtilities to their prejudice. This ſpeech was extremely well drawn, the thoughts being conceived in ſtrong figures, particularly expreſſive and agreeable to the Indians. The governor required an explicit declaration of their ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, concerning the French tranſactions at Niagara; and their anſwer was truly categorical. "We ſpeak now in the name of all the ſix nations, and come to you howling. This is the reaſon why we howl, that the governor of Canada encroaches on our land, and builds thereon." After which they intreated him to write to the king for ſuccour. Mr. Burnet embraced this favourable opportunity to procure from them a deed, ſurrendering their country to his majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to be protected for their uſe, and confirming their grant in 1701, concerning which there was only an entry in
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:024800_0182_0FCD63D0D0506828"/>the books of the ſecretary for Indian affairs<note n="*" place="bottom">Beſides the territories at the weſt end of lake Erie, and on the north ſide of that, and the lake Ontario, which were ceded in 1701; the Indians now granted, for the ſame purpoſe, all their habitations from Oſwego to Cayahoga river, which diſembogues into lake Erie, and the country extending ſixty miles from the ſouthermoſt banks of thoſe lakes. Though the firſt ſurrender, through negligence, was not made by the execution of a formal deed under ſeal; yet as it was tranſacted with all the ſolemnity of a treaty, and as the ſecond ſurrender confirms the firſt, no intermedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate poſſeſſion by the French, can prejudice the Britiſh title derived by the ceſſion in 1701.</note>. It happened very unfortunately, that his excellency's hands were then more weakened than ever, by the growing diſaffection in the houſe. The intrigues of his adverſaries, and the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent deaths of the members, had introduced ſuch a change in the aſſembly, that it was with difficulty he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a three years ſupport. The clamours of the people ran ſo high without doors for a new election, that he was obliged to diſſolve the houſe, and ſoon after another diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution enſued on the death of the king. The French, in the mean time, completed their works at Niagara: and mr. Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, who was unable to do any thing elſe, erected a fort, in 1727, for the protection of the poſt and trade at Oſwego. This neceſſary undertaking was pregnant with the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant conſequences, not only to this, but all our colonies; and though the governor's ſeaſonable activity deſerved the higheſt teſtimonials of our gratitude, I am aſhamed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, what I am bound to relate, that he built the fort at his private expenſe, and that a balance of about 56<abbr>l.</abbr> principal, though frequently demanded, remains due to his eſtate to this very day.</p>
            <p>Beauharnois, the governor of Canada, who ſuperſeded Longuiel, was ſo incenſed at the building of the fort, that he ſent a written ſummons in July, to the officer poſted there, to abandon it; and though his predeceſſor had done the ſame, a little before, at Niagara, in the country of the Senecas, the acknowledged ſubjects of the Britiſh crown<note n="†" place="bottom">Though the ſovereignty over the five nations was ceded to Great Britain, and Charlevoix himſelf had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that Niagara was part of their country, yet the pious jeſuit applauds the French ſettlement there, which was ſo manifeſt an infraction of the treaty of Utrecht. The marquis de Nonville, in his letter to the court of France, in 1686, propoſed the erection of a fort there, to ſecure the communication with the lakes, and deprive us of a trade which he computed to be worth 400,000 francs per annum. Charlevoix, perhaps, conſidered theſe advantages ſufficient to juſtify the violation of public faith; reaſoning upon the principles of le chevalier de Callieres, who thought the legality of making a conqueſt of New York, during the ſtrict peace in James IId's reign, might be infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the benefit, that would, thereby, accrue to the French colony, <hi>"qu' il n'y avoit point d'autre voye pour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver la colonie, que de nous rendre maitres de la Nouvelle York; et que cette conquête etoit legitime par la neceſſité."</hi>
               </note>,
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:024800_0183_0FCD63D281527870"/>yet, with a ſingular effrontery, he diſpatched de la Chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaigne, a man of parts, and governor of Trois Rivieres, to New York, with the ſtrongeſt complaints to mr. Burnet upon that head. His excellency ſent him a polite, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute anſwer, on the eighth of Auguſt; in which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed the arguments urged by the French governor gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; and remonſtrated againſt the proceedings of the laſt year at Niagara.</p>
            <p>The new aſſembly met in September 1727, and conſiſted of members all ill affected to the governor. The long continuance of the laſt, the clamours which were excited by ſeveral late important decrees in chancery, the affair of the French church, and eſpecially the prohibiting the Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da trade, were the cauſes, to which the loſs of his intereſt is to be aſcribed. Mr. Philipſe, the ſpeaker, was piqued at a decree in chancery againſt himſelf, which very much affected his eſtate; no wonder, then, that the members, who were very much influenced by him, came, on the 25th of November, into the following reſolutions. Colonel Hicks, from the committee of grievances, reported, "That as well by the complaints of ſeveral people, as by the general cry of his majeſty's ſubjects inhabiting this colony, they find that the court of chancery, as lately aſſumed to be ſet up here, renders the liberties and properties of the ſaid ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects extremely precarious; and that by the violent mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures taken in, and allowed by it, ſome have been ruined, others obliged to abandon the colony, and many reſtrained in it, either by impriſonment or by exceſſive bail exacted from them not to depart, even when no manner of ſuits are depending againſt them: and therefore are of opinion,
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:024800_0184_0FCD63D3CBF821F8"/>that the extraordinary proceedings of that court; and the exorbitant fees and charges, countenanced to be exacted by the officers and practitioners thereof, are the greateſt grievance and oppreſſion this colony hath ever felt: and that for removing the fatal conſequences thereof, they had come to ſeveral reſolutions, which being read, were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the houſe, and are as follow:</p>
            <p>"Reſolved, that the erecting or exerciſing, in this colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, a court of equity or chancery (however it may be term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) without conſent in general aſſembly, is unwarrantable, and contrary to the laws of England, and a manifeſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and grievance to the ſubjects, and of pernicious conſequence to their liberties and properties.</p>
            <p>"Reſolved, that this houſe will at their next meeting prepare and paſs an act to declare and adjudge all orders, ordinances, devices, and proceedings, of the court, ſo aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to be erected and exerciſed as abovementioned, to be illegal, null, and void, as by law and right they ought to be.</p>

            <p>Mr. Burnet no ſooner heard of theſe votes, than he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the members before him, and diſſolved the aſſembly. They occaſioned, however, an ordinance in the ſpring fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, as well to remedy ſundry abuſes in the practice in chancery, as to reduce the fees of that court, which, on account of the popular clamours, were ſo much diminiſhed, that the wheels of the chancery have ever ſince ruſted upon their axes, the practice being contemned by all gentlemen of eminence in the profeſſion.</p>
            <p>We are now come to the cloſe of mr. Burnet's admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, when he was appointed to the chief command of the Maſſachuſett's bay. Though we never had a governor, to whom the colony is ſo much indebted as to him; yet the influence of a faction, in the judgment of ſome, rendered his removal neceſſary for the public tranquillity. Inſenſible of his merit, the undiſtinguiſhing multitude were taught to conſider it as a moſt fortunate event; and till the ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deſigns of the French king, with reſpect to America, awakened our attention to the general welfare, mr. Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net's adminiſtration was as little eſteemed, as that of the meaneſt of his predeceſſors.</p>
            <p>He was very fond of New-York, and left it with reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:024800_0185_0FCD63D8D61AC870"/>His marriage here connected him with a numerous family; and, beſides an univerſal acquaintance, there were ſome gentlemen, with whom he contracted a ſtrict intimacy and friendſhip.</p>
            <p>The exceſſive love of money, a diſeaſe common to all his predeceſſors, and to ſome who ſucceeded him, was a vice, from which he was entirely free. He ſold no offices, nor at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to raiſe a fortune by indirect means; for he lived generouſly, and carried ſcarce any thing away with him, but his books. Theſe, and the converſation of men of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, were to him inexhauſtible ſources of delight. His aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomical obſervations have been uſeful; but by his comment on the apocalypſe, he expoſed himſelf, as other learned men have before him, to the criticiſms of thoſe who have not abilities to write half ſo well.</p>
            <p>John Montgomerie, <abbr>eſq</abbr> received the great ſeal of this province from mr. Burnet, on the 15th of April 1728, having a commiſſion to ſuperſede him here and in New-Jerſey. The council board conſiſted of

            <p>The governor was a Scotch gentleman, and bred a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier; but, in the latter part of his life, he had little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern with arms, having ſerved as groom of the bedcham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to his preſent majeſty, before his acceſſion to the throne. This ſtation, and a ſeat he had in parliament, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the way to his preferment in America. In his talents for government, he was much inferior to his predeceſſor; for he had neither ſtrength nor acuteneſs of parts, and was but little acquainted with any kind of literature.</p>
            <p>As in the natural, ſo in the political world, a violent ſtorm is often immediately ſucceeded by a peaceful calm; tired by the mutual ſtruggles of party rage, every man now ceaſed to act under its influence. The governor's good humour, too, extinguiſhed the flames of contention; for being unable to plan, he had no particular ſcheme to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue; and thus by confining himſelf to the exerciſe of the common acts of government, our public affairs flowed on in a peaceful, uninterrupted ſtream.</p>
            <p>The reader will, for this reaſon, find none of thoſe
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:024800_0186_0FCD63D9D7552118"/>events in col. Montgomerie's ſhort adminiſtration, which only take riſe under the ſuperintendency of a man of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive views. Indeed, he devoted himſelf ſo much to his eaſe, that he has ſcarce left us any thing to perpetuate the remembrance of his time.</p>
            <p>The two rocks upon which the public tranquillity was ſhipwrecked in the late adminiſtration, he carefully avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for he diſſolved the aſſembly, called by his predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, before they had ever been convened: and as to the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, he himſelf countenanced the clamours againſt it, by declining to ſit, till enjoined to exerciſe the office of chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor by ſpecial orders from England. He then obeyed the command, but not without diſcovering his reluctance, and modeſtly confeſſing to the practiſers, that he thought himſelf unqualified for the ſtation. Indeed the court of chancery was evidently his averſion, and he never gave a ſingle decree in it, nor more than three orders; and theſe, both as to matter and form, were firſt ſettled by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil concerned.</p>
            <p>Mr. Philipſe was choſen ſpeaker of the aſſembly which met on the 23d of July, and continued ſitting in perfect harmony till autumn. After his excellency had procured a five years ſupport, and ſeveral other laws to his mind, of leſs conſiderable moment; he went up to Albany, and, on the 1ſt of October, held a treaty with the ſix nations, for a renewal of the ancient covenant. He gave them great preſents, and engaged them in the defence of Oſwego. Nothing could be more ſeaſonable than this interview; for the French, who eyed that important garriſon, and our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing trade there, with the moſt reſtleſs jealouſy, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, early in the ſpring following, to demoliſh the works. Governor Burnet gave the firſt intelligence of this deſign, in a letter to colonel Montgomerie, dated at Boſton the 31ſt of March 1729. The garriſon was thereupon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately reinforced by a detachment from the indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent companies; which, together with the declared reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Indians, to protect the fort; induced the French to deſiſt from the intended invaſion<note n="*" place="bottom">From that time, to the year 1754, this garriſon was guarded only by a lieutenant and five and twenty men. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Shirley's parting from the forces deſtined againſt fort du Queſne, and proceeding with half the army to Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wego in 1755, was extremely fortunate to our colonies; the French being then determined and prepared to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs themſelves of that poſt. Beſides the veſſels launched there, to ſecure the command of the lake, the general, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he returned to winter quarters, erected two ſtrong ſquare forts, with baſtions, commanding as well the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the Onondaga river, as the old fort; in the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of which, little regard was had to any thing beſides the pleaſantneſs of the proſpect.</note>.</p>

Thus far our Indian affairs appeared to be under a tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable direction; but theſe fair proſpects were ſoon obſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the king's repealing, on the 11th of December, 1729, all the acts which mr. Burnet, with ſo much labour and oppoſition, procured for the prohibition of an execrable trade between Albany and Montreal. To whoſe intrigues this event is to be aſcribed, cannot be certainly determined. But that it was pregnant with the worſt conſequences, time has ſufficiently evinced. Nothing could more naturally tend to undermine the trade at Oſwego, to advance the French commerce, at Niagara, to alienate the Indians from their fidelity to Great Britain, and particularly to rivet the defection of the Caghnuagas. For theſe, reſiding on the ſouth ſide of St. Lawrence, nearly oppoſite Montreal, were employed by the French as their carriers; and thus became intereſted againſt us, by motives of the moſt prevailing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. One would imagine, that after all the attention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on this affair in the late adminiſtration, the objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt this trading intercourſe with Canada, muſt have been obvious to the meaneſt capacity; and yet, ſo aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhing has been our conduct, that from the time mr. Burnet removed to Boſton, it has rather been encouraged than reſtrained. This trade, indeed, was ſubject to duties; but that at Oſwego always was, and ſtill is, expoſed to the ſame incumbrance; while the French trade, in the interval between the years 1744 and 1750, was perfectly free: and as the duty, by the law then made, is laid only on goods ſold in the city and county of Albany, the trader, to elude the act, is only expoſed to the trouble of tranſporting his merchandiſe, beyond the ſcant diſtrict of the city, aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the charter. But how much ſoever our inattention to this matter may deſerve cenſure, I cannot, in juſtice to my countrymen, help obſerving, that from the ſevereſt ſcrutiny I could make, our people are free from the charge of ſelling ammunition to the French, which has ſo unjuſtly
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:024800_0188_0FCD63DE507B1208"/>expoſed the inhabitants of Albany, to the odium of all the colonies in New England<note n="*" place="bottom">Ever ſince the year 1729, the ſale of arms and ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the French, has been exempt both from duties and a prohibition; which I attribute to the confidence of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that the calumny is entirely groundleſs.</note>.</p>
            <p>The year 1731 was diſtinguiſhed, only by the complete ſettlement of the diſputed boundary between this province and the colony of Connecticut. An event, conſidering the late colonizing ſpirit, and extenſive claims of the people of New England, of no ſmall importance, and concerning which it may be proper to give a ſuccinct account.</p>
            <p>The partition line agreed upon in 1664, being conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as fraudulent, or erroneous; a ſecond agreement, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended only for the king's and the duke's approbation, was concluded on the 23d of November, 1683, between colonel Dongan and his council, and Robert Trent, <abbr>eſq</abbr> then go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of Connecticut, and ſeveral other commiſſioners ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by that colony. The line of partition, then agreed to be eſtabliſhed, was to begin at the mouth of Byram brook, "Where it falleth into the ſound, at a point called Lyon's point, to go as the ſaid river runneth, to the place where the common road, or wading place, over the ſaid river is; and from the ſaid road, or wading place, to go north north-weſt into the country, as far as will be eight Engliſh miles from the foreſaid Lyon's Point; and that a line of twelve miles, being meaſured from the ſaid Lyon's point, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the line or general courſe of the ſound eaſtward: where the ſaid twelve miles endeth, another line ſhall be run from the ſound, eight miles into the country, north north-weſt; and alſo, that a fourth line be run (that is to ſay) from the northermoſt end of the eight miles line, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the third mentioned line, which fourth line, with the firſt mentioned line, ſhall be the bounds where they ſhall fall to run; and that from the eaſtermoſt end of the fourth mentioned line (which is to be twelve miles in length) a line parallel to Hudſon's river, in every place twenty miles diſtant from Hudſon's river, ſhall be the bounds there, between the ſaid territories or province of New-York, and the ſaid colony of Connecticut, ſo far as Connecticut colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny doth extend northwards; that is, to the ſouth line of the Maſſachuſetts colony: only it is provided, that in caſe the line from Byram brook's mouth, north north-weſt eight miles, and the line, that is then to run twelve miles to the
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:024800_0189_0FCD63E1D0B344C0"/>end of the third fore-mentioned line of eight miles, do di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh or take away land, within twenty miles of Hudſon's river, that then ſo much as is in land diminiſhed of twenty miles of Hudſon's river thereby, ſhall be added out of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut bounds unto the line aforementioned, parallel to Hudſon's river, and twenty miles diſtant from it; the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to be made the whole length of the ſaid parallel line, and in ſuch breadth, as will make up, quantity for quantity, what ſhall be diminiſhed as aforeſaid."</p>
            <p>Purſuant to this agreement, ſome of the lines were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually run out, and a report made of the ſurvey, which, on the 24th of February 1684, was confirmed by the governor of each colony, at Milford in Connecticut. Here the matter reſted, till a diſpute aroſe concerning the right of juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over the towns of Rye and Bedford, which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned a ſolicitation at home; and on the 28th of March 1700, king William was pleaſed to confirm the agreement in 1683.</p>
            <p>Nineteen years afterwards, a probationary act was paſſed, empowering the governor to appoint commiſſioners, as well to run the line parallel to Hudſon's river, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurvey the other lines, and diſtinguiſh the boundary. The Connecticut agent oppoſed the king's confirmation of this act, <hi>totis viribus;</hi> but it was approved on the 23d of Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary 1723. Two years after, the commiſſioners and ſurveyors of both colonies met at Greenwich, and entered firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an agreement, relating to the method of performing the work.</p>
            <p>The ſurvey was immediately after executed in part, the report being dated on the 12th of May 1725; but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete ſettlement was not made till the 14th of May 1731, when indentures, certifying the execution of the agreement in 1725, were mutually ſigned by the commiſſioners and ſurveyors of both colonies. Upon the eſtabliſhment of this partition, a tract of land, lying on the Connecticut ſide, conſiſting of above 60,000 acres, from its figure called the Oblong, was ceded to New-York, as an equivalent for lands near the ſound, ſurrendered to Connecticut<note n="*" place="bottom">See Douglas's late plan of the Britiſh dominions of New England.</note>.</p>
            <p>The very day after the ſurrender, made by that colony, a patent paſſed in London to ſir Joſeph Eyles and others, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to convey the whole Oblong. A grant, poſterior to the other, was alſo regularly made here, to Hauley and
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:024800_0190_0FCD63E2D376E518"/>company, of the greateſt part of the ſame tract, which the Britiſh patentees brought a bill in chancery to repeal. But the defendants filed an anſwer, containing ſo many objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt the Engliſh patent, that the ſuit remains ſtill unproſecuted; and the American proprietors have ever ſince held the poſſeſſion. Mr. Hariſon, of the council, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited this controverſy for ſir Joſeph Eyles and his part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which contributed, in a great degree, to the troubles, ſo remarkable, in a ſucceeding adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>Governor Montgomerie died on the 1ſt of July 1731; and being a man of a kind and humane diſpoſition, his death was not a little lamented. The chief command then devolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Rip Van Dam, <abbr>eſq</abbr> he being the oldeſt counſellor, and an eminent merchant, of a fair eſtate, though diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed more for the integrity of his heart, than his capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to hold the reins of government.

            <p>This adminiſtration is unfortunately ſignalized by the memorable encroachment at Crown Point. An enemy deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed at firſt for his weakneſs, generally grows formidable for his activity and craft. This obſervation is true, applied to private perſons, religious ſects, or public ſtates. The French, in Canada, have always been jealous of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing ſtrength of our colonies; and a motive of fear led them, naturally, to concert a regular ſyſtem of conduct for their defence. Confining us to ſcant limits along the ſea coaſt, is the grand object they have long had in view; and ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the important paſſes from Canada to Louiſania, ſeducing our Indian allies, engroſſing the trade, and fortifying the routes into their country, were all proper expedients to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the execution of their plan. By erecting fort St. Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric, they ſecured the abſolute command of lake Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, through which we muſt paſs, if ever a deſcent be made upon Canada, either to conquer the country, or har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſs its out-ſettlements. The garriſon was, at firſt, ſituated
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:024800_0191_0FCD63E44BE8E788"/>on the eaſt ſide of the lake, near the ſouth end; but was afterwards built upon a commodious point, on the oppoſite ſide. Of all their infractions of the treaty of Utrecht, none was more palpable than this. The country belonged to the ſix nations: and the very ſpot, upon which the fort ſtands, is included within a patent to Dellius the Dutch miniſter of Albany, granted under the great ſeal of this province in 1696. Beſides, nothing could be more evident than the danger to which it expoſed us. Through this lake the French parties made their ancient bloody incurſions upon Schenectady, the Mohawks' caſtles, and Deerfield; and the erection of this fort was apparently adapted, to facilitate the inroads of the enemy, upon the frontiers of the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of New-York, Maſſachuſetts bay, and New Hampſhire; for it ſerved not only as an aſylum to fly to, after the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petration of their inhumanities, but for a magazine of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and ammunition; and though it was much above 120 miles from the very city of Albany, yet by the conveyance through Sorel river and the lake, it may be reinforced from Montreal in three or four days<note n="*" place="bottom">The preſent fort at Crown Point is ſaid to be a ſquare with four baſtions, and a high caſtle within the walls. It has no ditch, but is ſtrengthened by a redoubt, and mounts ſix and thirty ſmall cannon. While the colony forces, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of about 4000 militia, lay at lake George, employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in erecting fort William Henry, in 1755, the French threw up an advanced work at Ticonderoge, near the north-eaſt end of lake George; an important paſs, about 16 miles to the ſouthward of fort Frederic.</note>.</p>
            <p>The Maſſachuſetts government foreſaw the dangerous conſequences of the French fort at Crown Point, and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Belcher gave us the firſt information of it, in a letter from Boſton to mr. Van Dam. He informed him of the vote of the general court, to bear their proportion of the charge of an embaſſage to Canada, to forbid the works, and preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to engage the oppoſition of the ſix nations. Van Dam laid the letter before his council, on the 4th of Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary 1732; who, with ſingular calmneſs, adviſed him to write to the commiſſioners of Indian affairs, at Albany, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering them to enquire, whether the land belonged to the confederates or the river Indians. That mr. Van Dam ever wrote to the commiſſioners, I have not been able to diſcover; nor whether any complaint of the encroachment was ſent home, according to the ſecond advice of council, on the 11th
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:024800_0192_0FCD63E8A2B56FE0"/>of February; who, beſides the firſt ſtep, were now pleaſed to recommend his tranſmitting governor Belcher's letter and the Boſton vote to the ſeveral ſouth-weſtern colonies.</p>
            <p>The paſſiveneſs we diſcovered, on this impudent and dangerous invaſion of his majeſty's rights, is truly aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the more ſo, as the crown had, at that time, four in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent companies, which had long been poſted here for our protection, at the annual expenſe of about 7500<abbr>l.</abbr> ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. A very good ſcheme, in ſome meaſure, to repair this ſhameful miſconduct, was afterwards projected, by ſettling the lands near lake George, with loyal proteſtant highlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from Scotland. Captain Laughlin Campbel, encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a proclamation to that purpoſe, came over in 1737, and ample promiſes were made to him. He went upon the land, viewed and approved it; and was intreated to ſettle there, even by the Indians, who were taken with his high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land dreſs. Mr. Clarke, the lieutenant governor, promiſed him, in a printed advertiſement, the grant of 30,000 acres of land, free from all but the charges of the ſurvey and the king's quit-rent. Confiding on the faith of the government, captain Campbel went home to Iſla, ſold his eſtate, and, ſhortly after, tranſported, at his own expenſe, 83 proteſtant families, conſiſting of 423 adults, beſides a great number of children. Private faith and public honour loudly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the fair execution of a project, ſo expenſive to the undertaker and beneficial to the colony. But it unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately dropped, through the ſordid views of ſome perſons in power, who aimed at a ſhare in the intended grant; to which Campbel, who was a man of ſpirit, would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>Captain Campbel, afterwards, made an attempt to redreſs himſelf, by an application to the aſſembly here, and then to the board of trade in England. The firſt proved abortive, and ſuch were the difficulties attending the laſt, that he left his coloniſts to themſelves; and with the poor remains of his broken fortune purchaſed a ſmall farm in this province. No man was better qualified than he, for the buſineſs he had engaged in. He had a high ſenſe of honour and a good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: was active, loyal, and of a military diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For upon the news of the late rebellion in Scotland, he went home, fought under the duke, returned to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and ſoon after died; leaving a widow and ſeveral children, who ſtill feel the conſequences of his diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Mr. Van Dam finiſhed his adminiſtration, on the 1ſt of
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:024800_0193_0FCD63E98CC11360"/>Auguſt 1732; when William Coſby, <abbr>eſq</abbr> arrived, with a commiſſion, to govern this and the province of New-Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey. The hiſtory of our public tranſactions, from this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, to the preſent time, is full of important and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining events, which I leave others to relate. A very near relation to the author had ſo great a concern in the public controverſies with colonel Coſby, that the hiſtory of thoſe times will be better received from a more diſintereſted pen. To ſuppreſs truth on the one hand, or exaggerate it, on the other, are both inexcuſable faults, and perhaps it would be difficult for me to avoid thoſe extremes. Beſides, a writer, who expoſes the conduct of the living, will inevitably meet with their fury and reſentment. The prudent hiſtorian of his own times will always be a coward, and never give fire, till death protects him from the malice and ſtroke of his enemy.</p>

                                 <p>In obedience to your excellency's order, in council, of the 3d day of July laſt, referring to a committee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the petitions of Robert Livingſton, jun, <abbr>eſq</abbr> and of the owners of a certain tract on land called Weſtenhook, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of new claims and encroachments made upon their lands by the inhabitants of Maſſachuſetts bay, and alſo the ſurveyor general's and the attorney general's reports on the ſaid two petitions: the committee having maturely weighed and conſidered of the ſame, humbly beg leave to report to your excellency:</p>
                                 <p n="1">1ſt, That they apprehend the claims of Maſſachuſetts bay to the manor of Livingſton, or the ſaid tract of land, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Weſtenhook, cannot be well founded; becauſe they find that the Dutch claimed the colony of New Netherland, as extending from cape Cod to cape Cornelius, now called cape Henlopen, weſtward of Delaware bay, along the ſea coaſt, and as far back into the country, as any of the rivers within thoſe limits extend; and that they were actually poſſeſſed of Connecticut river, long before any other European peop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le knew any thing of the exiſtence of ſuch a river, and were not only poſſeſſed of the mouth of it, where they had a fort and garriſon, but diſcovered the river above an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles up, had their people trading there, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed of the natives almoſt all the lands on both ſides of the ſaid river.</p>
                                 <p n="2">2dly, That governor Stuyveſant, the Dutch governor of the ſaid province, by his letter, dated the 2d of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1664, new ſtile, in anſwer to a letter from governor Richard Nicolls, of the 20/30 Auguſt preceding, demanding the ſurrender of all the forts and places of ſtrength poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Dutch under his (governor Stuyveſant's) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, writes as follows:—"Moreover it's without diſpute, and acknowledged by all the world, that our predeceſſors, by virtue of the commiſſion and patent of the ſaid lords the ſtates general, have without controul, and peaceably (the contrary never coming to our knowledge) enjoyed fort Orange about 48 or 50 years; and Manhattans about 41 or 42 years; the ſouth river 40 years, and the freſh river a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 36 years." Which laſt mentioned river, the committee find to be the ſame, that is now called Connecticut river.</p>
                                 <p n="3">3dly, That the ſaid Dutch governor Stuyveſant did, in the year 1664, ſurrender all the country, which the Dutch did then poſſeſs, to king Charles the ſecond, and that the ſtates general made a ceſſion thereof, by the treaty of Breda, in the year 1667: that the Dutch re-conquered part of this province in 1673, and ſurrendered and abſolutely yielded it to king Charles the ſecond, in 1673-4, by the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of London; and that in the year 1674, king Charles granted to the duke of York, all the land between Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticut river and Delaware bay; the whole of theſe lands being part of the former colony of New Netherland.</p>
                                 <p n="4">4th, That the duke of York, in his ſeveral commiſſions to major Edmund Androſs, on the 1ſt of July 1674, and to governor Dongan on the 30th of September 1682, among other deſcriptions of the boundaries of this province, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions all the land from the weſt ſide of Connecticut river to the eaſt ſide of Delaware bay: that their majeſties, king William and queen Mary, by their commiſſion, bearing date the fourth day of January, in the firſt year of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties' reign, appointed Henry Sloughter to be governor of the province of New-York, and territories depending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the boundaries whereof, to Connecticut river, on the eaſt, were notorious, by the grant and other commiſſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, and many other grants and commiſſions relating to the ſame.</p>
                                 <p n="5">5th, That the committee apprehend Connecticut river continued the eaſt bounds of this province, until the 28th of March 1700, when, by king William's confirmation of an agreement between this provi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                                    </gap> and Connecticut, the weſtern bounds of that colony were ſettled at twenty miles from Hudſon's river: and they cannot find any other altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the eaſtern bounds of this province, and have no reaſon to believe any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                                       <desc>•••</desc>
                                    </gap>er was made before, or ſince, that time.</p>
                                 <p n="6">6th, "That king James the firſt, by letters patent bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing date the 3d of November, in the 18th year of his reign, granted unto the council of Plymouth, from forty to forty-eight degrees of north latitude incluſive, in which there is a recital to this purpoſe. "Now for as much as the king has been certainly given to underſtand, by divers good ſubjects, that have, for theſe many years, frequented thoſe coaſts and territories, between the degrees of 40<hi rend="sup">o</hi> and 48<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, that there are no other ſubjects of any chriſtian king or ſtate, or by any authority from their ſovereigns, lords, or princes, actually in poſſeſſion of any the ſaid lands or precincts, whereby any right, claim, intereſt, or title, may, or ought, by that means, to accrue or belong to them," &amp;c. And alſo a proviſo in theſe words, "Provided always, that the ſaid lands, iſlands, or any of the premiſſes, by the ſaid letters patent intended or meant to be granted, were not then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually poſſeſſed or inhabited by any other chriſtian power or ſtate." Which patent, the committee conceive, could not veſt any thing in the grantees, by reaſon of the ſaid recital and condition upon which it was granted; part of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes being then actually poſſeſſed by the Dutch, and moſt of the ſaid colony of New Netherland being within the bounds thereof.</p>
                                 <p n="7">7th, That the council of Plymouth, by their deed, dated the 19th of March, in the third year of king Charles the firſt, granted to ſir Henry Roſſwell and others, part of what was ſuppoſed to be granted by the ſaid letters patent, which grant, from the ſaid council of Plymouth, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee take to be void, as founded upon the ſaid void pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
                                 <p n="8">8th, That he, the ſaid ſir Henry Roſſwell, and others, obtained a grant and confirmation thereof, from the crown, under the great ſeal of England, dated the 4th of March, in the fourth year of king Charles the firſt, within which grant and confirmation, the province of Maſſachuſetts bay is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; which grant and confirmation was adjudged void in the high court of chancery of England, in the year 1684. And the committee are of opinion, that nothing, to the weſtward of Connecticut river, could paſs by that grant and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; for that his majeſty could not have had an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to grant the ſame, it being then poſſeſſed by the Dutch, as before mentioned.</p>
                                 <p n="9">9th, That the committee conceive the inhabitants of Maſſachuſetts bay can claim nothing at preſent, but what is granted them by their laſt charter in 1691; all their other grants and charters being either void of themſelves, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared ſo in the chancery of England.</p>
                                 <p n="10">10th, That the bounds granted, by this charter, are weſtward as far as the colonies of Rhode Iſland, Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut, and the Narraganſet country: which words being in the caſe of a grant from the crown, the committee conceive, cannot extend their bounds farther than to Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut colony, and therefore not to Connecticut river, and much leſs to the weſtward of it; becauſe Connecticut it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, at the time of that charter, did not, in the knowledge of the crown, extend weſtward of that river; nor did till nine years after, when, by the royal approbation, the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between this province and that colony taking place, (which was not to be in force till ſuch approbation) the bounds of that colony were ſettled as is before mentioned: and the committee conceive it to be againſt reaſon, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that the crown intended, by the ſaid charter, to grant any part of the province of New-York, under the then immediate government of the crown, without expreſs men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof in the charter; and without notification there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to Henry Sloughter, then governor of this province, that the crown had granted ſuch a part of what was before with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his juriſdiction, by their majeſties' commiſſion aforeſaid to him.</p>
                                 <p n="11">11th, That both the patents, under which the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners claim, the committee find were granted under the great ſeal of this province; that of the manor of Livingſton in 1686, and that of Weſtenhook in 1735. And that the lands contained in the ſaid grants are, the committee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, within the juriſdiction of this province, they being both weſt of Connecticut river.</p>
                                 <p n="12">12th, That the committee are of opinion, the attempts of the inhabitants of the Maſſachuſetts bay, to make en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments upon any lands, granted by letters patent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the great ſeal of New-York, or upon any lands within the juriſdiction of this province, are diſreſpectful to his majeſty's authority, tend to the diſturbance of the ſubjects of this province, and may be the cauſe of great miſchiefs and diſorders.</p>
                                 <p n="13">13th, That the ſteps taken by the ſaid inhabitants, even were the bounds of this province doubtful and unſettled, are intruſions, and diſreſpectful to his majeſty's authority.</p>
                                 <p>"And laſtly, The committee are of opinion, that a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of ſo much of this report, as ſhall be approved of by your excellency and the council, be tranſmitted to the lieuten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant governor of the province of Maſſachuſetts bay, requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he would take effectual meaſures, that all encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and diſturbances, by the people of that colony, on his majeſty's ſubjects of this province, be ſtayed; and that he would lay this matter before the next general court, that they may inform your excellency, by what warrant they claim or exerciſe any right to ſoil or juriſdiction, weſtward of Connecticut river; that the ſame may be conſidered, and ſuch ſteps taken towards removing all cauſes of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments, or diſturbances, for the future, as may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to equity and juſtice: to the end, that good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding may be preſerved, which ought to ſubſiſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween fellow ſubjects and neighbouring provinces.</p>

                     <p>The government of the Maſſachuſetts bay never exhibited the reaſons of their claim, in anſwer to this report, but continued their encroachments: and, in the ſpring, 1755, ſurveyed and ſold lands, lying ſeveral miles weſt of the eaſtern extent of the manor of Livingſton and the patent of Claverack.</p>

<pb n="201" facs="unknown:024800_0196_0FCD580552802520"/>thence, whereſoever it may be fixed, we claim all the lands, on the eaſt ſide of Delaware, to the north line of Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania; and all the territory, on both ſides of the Mohawks'
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:024800_0197_0FCD5809C04D7038"/>river, and weſtward to the Iſthmus at Niagara: in a word, all the country belonging to the crown of Great Britain, not already granted; for we are to conſider New York a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

               <p>Hence we have, from the beginning, been expoſed to
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:024800_0199_0FCD63EE903ED428"/>controverſies about limits. The New-Jerſey claim includes ſeveral hundred thouſand acres, and has not a little imped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſettlement of the colony. The diſpute with the Maſſachuſetts bay is ſtill more important, and, for ſeveral years paſt, occaſioned very conſiderable commotions. The New Hampſhire pretenſions have, as yet, expoſed us to no great trouble. But when all thoſe claims are ſettled, a new controverſy will probably commence with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietaries of Pennſylvania.</p>

                  <head>THE CITY AND COUNTY OF NEW-YORK.</head>
                  <p>THE city of New-York, at firſt, included only the iſland, called by the Indians, Manhattans. Manning's iſland, the two Barn iſlands, and the three Oyſter iſlands were in the county. But the limits of the city have ſince been aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by charter. The iſland is very narrow, not a mile wide at a medium, and about 14 miles in length. The ſouth-weſt point projects into a fine ſpacious bay, nine miles long, and about four in breadth, at the confluence of the waters of Hudſon's river, and the ſtreight between Long Iſland and the northern ſhore. The Narrows, at the ſouth end of the bay, is ſcarce two miles wide, and opens the ocean to full view. The paſſage up to New-York from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> is ſafe, and not above five and twenty miles in length. The common navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation is between the eaſt and weſt banks, in two or three and twenty feet water. But it is ſaid, that an eighty gun ſhip may be brought up, through a narrow, winding, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequented channel, between the north end of the eaſt bank and Coney Iſland.</p>
                  <p>The city has, in reality, no natural baſon or harbour. The ſhips lie off in the road, on the eaſt ſide of the town, which is docked out, and better built than the weſt ſide, becauſe the freſhets in Hudſon's river, fill it in ſome winters with ice.</p>
                  <p>The city of New-York, as I have elſewhere had occaſion to mention, "conſiſts of about two thouſand five hundred buildings. It is a mile in length, and not above half that in breadth. Such is its figure in its centre of buſineſs, and the ſituation of the houſes, that the mean cartage from one part to another, does not exceed above one quarter of a mile, than which nothing can be more advantageous to a trading city."</p>
                  <p>It is thought to be as healthy a ſpot as any in the world. The eaſt and ſouth parts, in general, are low, but the reſt is ſituated on a dry, elevated ſoil. The ſtreets are irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; but, being paved with round pebbles, are clean, and lined with well-built brick houſes, many of which are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with tiled roofs.</p>
                  <p>No part of America is ſupplied with markets abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with greater plenty and variety. We have beef, pork, mutton, poultry, butter, wild fowl, veniſon, fiſh, roots, and herbs, of all kinds, in their ſeaſons. Our oyſters are a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:024800_0201_0FCD63F1D0666CE0"/>article in the ſupport of the poor. Their beds are within view of the town; a fleet of two hundred ſmall craft, are often ſeen there, at a time, when the weather is mild in winter; and this ſingle article is computed to be worth annually 10 or 12,000<abbr>l.</abbr>
                  </p>
                  <p>This city is the metropolis and grand mart of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and, by its commodious ſituation, commands alſo all the trade of the weſtern part of Connecticut and that of Eaſt Jerſey. "No ſeaſon prevents our ſhips from launching out into the ocean. During the great ſeverity of winter, an equal, unreſtrained activity runs through all ranks, orders, and employments."</p>
                  <p>Upon the ſouth-weſt point of the city ſtands the fort, which is a ſquare with four baſtions. Within the walls is the houſe in which our governors uſually reſide; and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to it, brick barracks, built formerly for the independent companies. The governor's houſe is in height three ſtories, and fronts to the weſt; having, from the ſecond ſtory, a fine proſpect of the bay and the Jerſey ſhore. At the ſouth end there was formerly a chapel, but this was burnt down in the negro conſpiracy of the ſpring 1741. According to governor Burnet's obſervations, this fort ſtands in the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude 40<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 42′ N.</p>
                  <p>Below the walls of the garriſon, near the water, we have lately raiſed a line of fortifications, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the entrance into the eaſtern road and the mouth of Hudſon's river. This battery is built of ſtone, and the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons conſiſt of cedar joiſts, filled in with earth. It mounts 92 cannon, and theſe are all the works we have to defend us. About ſix furlongs, ſouth-eaſt of the fort, lies Notten Iſland, containing about 100 or 120 acres, reſerved by an act of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, as a ſort of demeſne for the governors, upon which it is propoſed to erect a ſtrong caſtle, becauſe an enemy might from thence eaſily bombard the city, without being annoyed either by our battery or the fort. During the late war, a line of paliſadoes was run from Hudſon's to the Eaſt river, at the other end of the city, with block-houſes at ſmall diſtances. The greater part of theſe ſtill remain as a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our folly, which coſt the province about 8000<abbr>l.</abbr>
                  </p>
                  <p>The inhabitants of New-York are a mixed people, but moſtly deſcended from the original Dutch planters. There are ſtill two churches, in which religious worſhip is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in that language. The old building is of ſtone and ill built, ornamented with a ſmall organ loft and braſs branches. The new church is a high, heavy edifice, has a very extenſive area, and was completed in 1729. It has no
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:024800_0202_0FCD63F4844E2088"/>galleries, and yet will perhaps contain a thouſand or twelve hundred auditors. The ſteeple of this church affords a moſt beautiful proſpect, both of the city beneath and the ſurrounding country. The Dutch congregation is more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous than any other; but as the language becomes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed, it is much diminiſhed; and unleſs they change their worſhip into the Engliſh tongue, muſt ſoon ſuffer a total diſſipation. They have at preſent two miniſters: the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend meſſieurs Ritzma and de Ronde, who are both ſtrict Calviniſts. Their church was incorporated on the 11th of May, 1696, by the name of "the miniſter, elders, and dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, of the reformed proteſtant Dutch church of the city of New-York:" and its eſtate, after the expiration of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry long leaſes, will be worth a very great income<note n="*" place="bottom">Their charter was confirmed by a late act of aſſembly, ratified by his majeſty, which recites the VIIIth article of the ſurrender in 1664.</note>.</p>
                  <p>All the Low Dutch congregations, in this and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of New-Jerſey, worſhip after the manner of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed church in the united provinces. With reſpect to government, they are in principle preſbyterians; but yet hold themſelves in ſubordination to the claffis of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam, who ſometimes permit, and at other times refuſe them the powers of ordination. Some of their miniſters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider ſuch a ſubjection as anti-conſtitutional, and hence in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of their late annual conventions, at New-York, called the coetus, ſome debates have ariſen among them; the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority being inclined to erect a claffis, or eccleſiaſtical judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory, here, for the government of their churches. Thoſe of their miniſters, who are natives of Europe, are, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, averſe to the project. The expenſe attending the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of their candidates, in Holland, and the reference of their diſputes to the claffis of Amſterdam, is very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable; and with what conſequences, the interruption of their correſpondence with the European Dutch, would be attended, in caſe of a war, well deſerves their conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>There are, beſides the Dutch, two epiſcopal churches in this city, upon the plan of the eſtabliſhed church in South Britain. Trinity church was built in 1696, and afterwards enlarged in 1737. It ſtands very pleaſantly upon the banks of Hudſon's river, and has a large cemetery, on each ſide, encloſed in the front, by a painted, paled fence. Before it a long walk is railed off from the broad-way, the pleaſanteſt
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:024800_0203_0FCD63F717433340"/>ſtreet of any in the whole town. This building is about 148 feet long, including the tower and chancel, and 72 feet in breadth. The ſteeple is 175 feet in height, and over the door, facing the river, is the following inſcription.</p>

                  <p>The church is, within, ornamented beyond any other place of public worſhip among us. The head of the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel is adorned with an altar-piece, and oppoſite to it, at the other end of the building, is the organ. The tops of the pillars which ſupport the galleries, are decked with the gilt buſts of angels winged. From the ceiling are ſuſpended two glaſs branches, and on the walls hang the arms of ſome of its principal benefactors. The ailes are paved with flat ſtones.</p>
                  <p>The preſent rector of this church is the rev. mr. Henry Barclay, formerly a miſſionary among the Mohawks, who receives 100<abbr>l.</abbr> a year, levied upon all the other clergy and laity in the city, by virtue of an act of aſſembly, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by governor Fletcher. He is aſſiſted by dr. Johnſon and mr. Auchmuty.</p>
                  <p>This congregation, partly by the arrival of ſtrangers from Europe, but principally by proſelytes from the Dutch churches, is become ſo numerous, that though the old buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding will contain 2000 hearers, yet a new one was erected in 1752. This, called St. George's chapel<note n="*" place="bottom">The length, excluſive of the chancel, 92 feet, and its breadth 20 feet leſs.</note>, is a very great edifice, faced with hewn ſtone and tiled. The ſteeple
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:024800_0204_0FCD63F908F54238"/>is lofty<note n="†" place="bottom">One hundred and ſeventy-five feet.</note>, but irregular; and its ſituation in a new, crouded, and ill-built part of the town.</p>
                  <p>The rector, churchwardens, and veſtrymen of Trinity church, are incorporated by an act of aſſembly, which grants the two laſt the advowſon or right of preſentation; but enacts, that the rector ſhall be inſtituted and inducted in a manner moſt agreeable to the king's inſtructions to the governor, and the canonical right of the biſhop of London. Their worſhip is conducted after the mode of the church of England; and with reſpect to government, they are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to make rules and orders for themſelves, being, if I may uſe the expreſſion, an independent, eccleſiaſtical cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration.</p>
                  <p>The revenue of this church is reſtricted, by an act of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, to 500<abbr>l.</abbr> per annum: but it is poſſeſſed of a real eſtate, at the north end of the town, which, having been lately divided into lots, and let to farm, will, in a few years, produce a much greater income.</p>
                  <p>The preſbyterians increaſing after lord Cornbury's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to England, called mr. Anderſon, a Scotch miniſter, to the paſtoral charge of their congregation: and dr. John Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>col, Patrick Mac Night, Gilbert Livingſton, and Thomas Smith, purchaſed a piece of ground, and founded a church in 1719. Two years afterwards, they petitioned colonel Schuyler, who had then the chief command, for a charter of incorporation, to ſecure their eſtate for religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, upon the plan of the church in North-Britain; but were diſappointed in their expectations, through the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the epiſcopal party. They, ſhortly after, renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their requeſt to governor Burnet, who referred the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition to his council. The epiſcopalians again violently op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the grant; and the governor, in 1724, wrote upon the ſubject to the lords of trade for their direction. Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor Weſt, who was then conſulted, gave his opinion, in theſe words: "Upon conſideration of the ſeveral acts of uniformity, that have paſſed in Great Britain, I am of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that they do not extend to New-York, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an act of toleration is of no uſe in that province; and, therefore, as there is no provincial act for uniformity, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the church of England, I am of opinion, that by law ſuch patent of incorporation may be granted, as by the petition is deſired. RICHARD WEST, 20 Auguſt, 1724."</p>
                  <p>After ſeveral years ſolicitation for a charter in vain, and
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:024800_0205_0FCD63FA0E33F898"/>fearful that thoſe who obſtructed ſuch a reaſonable requeſt, would watch an opportunity to give them a more effectual wound; thoſe, among the preſbyterians, who were inveſted with the fee ſimple of the church and ground, "conveyed it, on the 16th of March, 1730, to the moderator of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral aſſembly of the church of Scotland and the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thereof, the moderator of the preſbytery of Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, the principal of the college of Edinburgh, the profeſſor of divinity therein, and the procurator and agent of the church of Scotland, for the time being, and their ſucceſſors in office, as a committee of the general aſſembly." On the 15th of Auguſt, 1732, the church of Scotland, (by an inſtrument under the ſeal of the general aſſembly, and ſigned by mr. Niel Campbell, principal of the univerſity of Glaſgow, and moderator of the general aſſembly and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion thereof—mr. James Neſbit, one of the miniſters of the goſpel at Edinburgh, moderator of the preſbytery of Edinburgh—mr. Wm. Hamilton, principal of the univerſity of Edinburgh—mr. James Smith, profeſſor of divinity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in—and mr. William Grant, advocate procurator for the church of Scotland, for the time being) purſuant to an act of the general aſſembly, dated May, 1731, did declare, "That notwithſtanding the aforeſaid right made to them and their ſucceſſors in office, they were deſirous, that the aforeſaid building, and edifice, and appurtenances thereof, be preſerved for the pious and religious purpoſes for which the ſame were deſigned; and that it ſhould be free and lawful to the preſbyterians, then reſiding, or that ſhould at any time, thereafter, be reſident, in, or near, the aforeſaid city of New-York, in America, or others joining with them, to convene, in the foreſaid church, for the worſhip of God in all the parts thereof, and for the diſpenſation of all goſpel ordinances; and generally to uſe and occupy the ſaid church and its appurtenances, fully and freely in all times coming, they ſupporting and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the edifice and appurtenances at their own charge."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Anderſon was ſucceeded, in April, 1727, by the rev. mr. Ebenezer Pemberton, a man of polite breeding, pure morals, and warm devotion; under whoſe inceſſant labours, the congregation greatly increaſed, and was enabled to erect the preſent edifice in 1748. It is built of ſtone, railed off from the ſtreet, is 80 feet long, and in breadth 60. The ſteeple, raiſed on the ſouth-weſt end, is in height 145 feet. In the front to the ſtreet, between two long windows, is the following inſcription, gilt and cut in a black ſlate, ſix feet in length.</p>

                  <p>Mr. Alexander Cumming, a young gentleman of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſingular penetration, was choſen colleague to mr. Pemberton, in 1750: but both were diſmiſſed, at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, about three years afterwards; the former, through indiſpoſition, and the latter, on account of trifling conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, kindled by the bigotry and ignorance of the lower ſort of people. Theſe debates continued till they were cloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in April 1756, by a deciſion of the ſynod, to which, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all our preſbyterian churches, in this and the ſouthern provinces, are ſubject. The congregation conſiſts, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, of 12 or 1400 ſouls, under the paſtoral charge of the rev. mr. David Boſtwick, who was lately tranſlated from Jamaica to New-York, by a ſynodical decree. He is a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of a mild, catholic diſpoſition; and being a man of piety, prudence, and zeal, confines himſelf entirely to the proper buſineſs of his function. In the art of preaching, he is one of the moſt diſtinguiſhed clergymen in theſe parts. His diſcourſes are methodical, ſound, and pathetic; in ſentiment, and in point of diction, ſingularly ornament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He delivers himſelf without notes, and yet with great
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:024800_0207_0FCD63FFB505C2D0"/>eaſe and fluency of expreſſion; and performs every part of divine worſhip with a ſtriking ſolemnity.</p>
                  <p>The French church, by the contentions in 1724, and the diſuſe of the language, is now reduced to an inconſiderable handful. The building, which is of ſtone, nearly a ſquare<note n="*" place="bottom">The area is ſeventy feet long, and in breadth fifty.</note>, plain both within and without. It is fenced from the ſtreet, has a ſteeple and a bell, the latter of which was the gift of ſir Henry Aſhurſt of London. On the front of the church is the following inſcription,
<q>AEDES SACRA GALLOR. PROT. REFORM. FVNDA. 1704. PENITVS REPAR. 1741.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The preſent miniſter, mr. Carle, is a native of France, and ſucceeded mr. Rou in 1754. He bears an irreproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able character, is very intent upon his ſtudies, preaches mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Calviniſm, and ſpeaks with propriety, both of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation and geſture.</p>
                  <p>The German Lutheran churches are two. Both their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of worſhip are ſmall: one of them has a cupola and bell.</p>
                  <p>The quakers have a meeting-houſe, and the Moravians, a new ſect among us, a church, conſiſting principally of female proſelytes from other ſocieties. Their ſervice is in the Engliſh tongue.</p>
                  <p>The anabaptiſts aſſemble at a ſmall meeting-houſe, but have as yet no regular ſettled congregation. The Jews, who are not inconſiderable for their numbers, worſhip in a ſynagogue erected in a very private part of the town, plain without, but very neat within.</p>
                  <p>The city hall is a ſtrong brick building, two ſtories in height, in the ſhape of an oblong, winged with one at each end, at right angles with the firſt. The floor below is an open walk, except two jails and the jailor's apartments. The cellar underneath is a dungeon, and the garret above a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon priſon. This edifice is erected in a place where four ſtreets meet, and fronts, to the ſouth-weſt, one of the moſt ſpacious ſtreets in town. The eaſtern wing, in the ſecond
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:024800_0208_0FCD6400CDC82708"/>ſtory, conſiſts of the aſſembly chamber, a lobby, and a ſmall room for the ſpeaker of the houſe. The weſt wing, on the ſame floor, forms the council room and a library; and in the ſpace between the ends, the ſupreme court is ordinarily held.</p>
                  <p>The library conſiſts of a thouſand volumes, which were bequeathed to "the ſociety for the propagation of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in foreign parts," by dr. Millington, rector of Newing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. Mr. Humphreys, the ſociety's ſecretary, in a letter of the 23d of September 1728, informed governor Montgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merie, that the ſociety intended to place theſe books in New-York, intending to eſtabliſh a library, for the uſe of the clergy and gentlemen of this and the neighbouring governments of Connecticut, New Jerſey, and Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, upon giving ſecurity to return them; and deſired the governor to recommend it to the aſſembly, to provide a place to depoſit the books, and to concur in an act for the preſervation of them and others that might be added. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor Montgomerie ſent the letter to the aſſembly, who ordered it to be laid before the city corporation: and the latter, in June 1729, agreed to provide a proper repoſitory for the books, which were accordingly ſoon after ſent over. The greateſt part of them are upon theological ſubjects; and through the careleſſneſs of the keepers, many are miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>
                  <p>In 1754, a ſet of gentlemen undertook to carry about a ſubſcription towards raiſing a public library, and in a few days collected near 600<abbr>l.</abbr> which were laid out in purchaſing about 700 volumes of new, well-choſen books. Every ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriber, upon payment of 5<abbr>l.</abbr> principal, and the annual ſum of 10<abbr>s.</abbr> is entitled to the uſe of theſe books. His right by the articles is aſſignable, and, for non-compliance with them, may be forfeited. The care of this library, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to twelve truſtees, annually elected by the ſubſcribers, on the laſt Tueſday of April, who are reſtricted from making any rules repugnant to the fundamental ſubſcription. This is the beginning of a library, which, in proceſs of time, will probably become vaſtly rich and voluminous; and it would be very proper for the company to have a charter for its ſecurity and encouragement. The books are depoſited in the ſame room with thoſe given by the ſociety.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the city hall, there belong to the corporation, a large alms-houſe or place of correction, and the exchange, in the latter of which there is a large room raiſed upon
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:024800_0209_0FCD6402646064A8"/>brick arches, generally uſed for public entertainments, concerts of muſic, balls and aſſemblies.</p>
                  <p>Though the city was put under the government of a mayor, &amp;c. in 1665, it was not regularly incorporated till 1686. Since that time ſeveral charters have been paſſed: the laſt was granted by governor Montgomerie, on the 15th of January, 1730.</p>
                  <p>It is divided into ſeven wards, and is under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a mayor, recorder, ſeven aldermen, and as many aſſiſtants, or common councilmen. The mayor, a ſheriff, and coroner, are annually appointed by the governor. The recorder has a patent during pleaſure. The aldermen, aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, aſſeſſors, and collectors, are annually elected by the freemen and freeholders of the reſpective wards. The mayor has the ſole appointment of a deputy, and, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with four aldermen, may appoint a chamberlain. The mayor, or recorder, four aldermen, and as many aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, form "the common council of the city of New-York:" and this body, by a majority of voices, hath power to make bye-laws for the government of the city, which are binding only for a year, unleſs confirmed by the governor and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. They have many other privileges relating to ferriages, markets, fairs, the aſſize of bread, wine, &amp;c. and the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſing and regulation of tavern keepers, cartage, and the like. The mayor, his deputy, the recorder and aldermen, are conſtituted juſtices of the peace; and may hold not only a court of record once a week, to take cognizance of all civil cauſes, but alſo a court of general quarter ſeſſions of the peace. They have a common clerk, commiſſioned by the governor, who enjoys an appointment worth about four or five hundred pounds per annum. The annual revenue of the corporation is near two thouſand pounds. The ſtanding mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia of the iſland conſiſts of about 2300 men<note n="*" place="bottom">The whole number of the inhabitants, excluſive of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males above ſixty, according to a liſt returned to the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, in the ſpring 1756, amounted to 10,468 whites, and 2275 negroes; but that account is erroneous. It is moſt probable, that there are in the city 15,000 ſouls.</note>: and the city has in reſerve, a thouſand ſtand of arms for ſeamen, the poor, and others, in caſe of an invaſion.</p>
                  <p>The north eaſtern part of New-York iſland is inhabited, principally, by Dutch farmers, who have a ſmall village there, called Haerlem, pleaſantly ſituated on a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It contains a vaſt quantity of fine low land. its principal commodities are wheat, peaſe, and pine boards.</p>
                  <p>The city of Albany, which is near 150 miles from New-York, is ſituated on the weſt ſide of the river. There our governors uſually treat with the Indians dependent upon the Britiſh crown. The houſes are built of brick, in the Dutch taſte, and are in number about 350. There are two churches in it. That of the epiſcopalians, the only one in this large county, is a ſtone building. The congregation is but ſmall, almoſt all the inhabitants reſorting to the Duch church, which is a plain, ſquare, ſtone edifice. Beſides theſe they have no other public buildings, except the city hall and the fort; the latter of which is a ſtone ſquare, with four baſtions, ſituated on an eminence which overlooks the town, but is itſelf commanded by higher ground. The greateſt part of the city is fortified only by paliſadoes, and in ſome places there are ſmall cannon planted in block-houſes. Albany was incorporated by colonel Dongan, in 1686, and is under the government of a mayor, recorder, ſix alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and as many aſſiſtants. It has alſo a ſheriff, town clerk, chamberlain, clerk of the markets, one high conſtable, three ſub-conſtables, and a marſhal. The corporation is empower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beſides to hold a mayor's court for the trial of civil cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and a court of general quarter ſeſſions.</p>
                  <p>Sixteen or eighteen miles north-weſt from Albany, lies Schenectady, on the banks of the Mohawks' river, which falls into Hudſon's river 12 miles to the North of Albany. This village is compact and regular, built principally of brick, on a rich flat of low land, ſurrounded with hills. It has a large Dutch church, with a ſteeple and town clock, near the centre. The windings of the river through the town, and the fields (which are often overflowed in the ſpring) form, about harveſt, a moſt beautiful proſpect. The lands, in the vale of Schenectady, are ſo fertile, that they are commonly ſold at 45<abbr>l.</abbr> per acre. Though the farmers uſe no kind of manure, they till the fields every year, and
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:024800_0212_0FCD640B54DA0728"/>they always produce full crops of wheat or peaſe. Their church was incorporated by governor Coſby; and the town has the privilege of ſending a member to the aſſembly.</p>
                  <p>From this village, our Indian traders ſet out in battoes for Oſwego. The Mohawks' river, from hence to fort Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, abounds with rifts and ſhoals, which, in the ſpring, give but little obſtruction to the navigation. From thence to its head, or rather to the portage into the Wood Creek, the conveyance is eaſy, and the current leſs rapid. The banks of this river are, in general, low, and the ſoil exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good. Our ſettlements, on the north ſide, extend to Burnet's field, a flat inhabited by Germans, which produces wheat and peaſe in ſurpriſing plenty. On the ſouth ſide, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a few Scotch Iriſh, in Cherry Valley, at the head of Suſquehanna, we have but few farms weſt of the three Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man towns on Schohare, a ſmall creek which empties itſelf into the Mohawks' river, about 20 miles weſt of Schenecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. The fur trade, at Oſwego, is one of the principal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of this county. The Indians reſort thither in May; and the trade continues till the latter end of July. A good road might be made from Schenectady to Oſwego. In the ſummer 1755, fat cattle were eaſily driven there for the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my under the command of general Shirley.</p>
                  <p>The principal ſettlements to the northward of Albany, are Conneſtigiune, eaſtward of Schenectady, on the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawks' river, which, a little lower, tumbles down a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice of about ſeventy feet high, called the Cahoes. The ſurpriſe, which, as one might imagine, would naturally be excited by the view of ſo great a cataract, is much dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by the height of the banks of the river; beſides, the fall is as uniform as a mill dam, being uninterrupted by the projection of rocks.</p>
                  <p>At Scaghtahook, on the eaſt ſide of the north branch of Hudſon's river, there are a few farms, but many more ſeveral miles to the eaſtward, and about twenty-five miles from Albany, in the patent of Hoſick. Theſe were all broke up by an irruption of French and Indians, who, on the 28th of Auguſt 1754, killed and ſcalped two perſons, and ſet fire to the houſes and barns.</p>
                  <p>About forty miles to the northward of Albany, on the weſt ſide of the river, lies Saratoga, a fine tract of low land, from which ſeveral families were driven by the French Indians, in the late war. A project of purchaſing theſe lands from the proprietors, ſettling them with Indians, raiſing a fort there, and cultivating the ſoil for them, has been often talked of ſince captain Campbell's diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:024800_0213_0FCD640D0CBA4148"/>as a proper expedient to curb the ſcalping pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In the ſouthern part of the county of Albany, on both ſides of Hudſon's river, the ſettlements are very ſcattered, except within twelve miles of the city, when the banks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come low and acceſſible. The iſlands here, which are many, contain perhaps the fineſt ſoil in the world.</p>
                  <p>There are two manors in the county, Ronſlaerwick and Livingſton, which have each the privilege of ſending a member to the aſſembly. The tenants of theſe manors, and of the patents of Claverack, have free farms, at the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual rent of a tenth of the produce, which has as yet been neither exacted nor paid. At Ancram, in the manor of Livingſton, is an iron furnace, about fourteen miles from the river. Its beſt and moſt improved lands lie at Tachanio in the eaſtern parts, which have of late been much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed by the inroads of the Maſſachuſetts boy, on this and the patents of Weſternhook and Claverack.</p>
                  <p>The winters in this county are commonly ſevere: and Hudſon's river freezes ſo hard, a hundred miles to the ſouthward of Albany, as to bear ſleds loaded with great burdens. Much ſnow is very ſerviceable to the farmers here, not only in protecting their grain from the froſt, but in facilitating the tranſportation of their boards and other produce, to the banks of the river againſt the enſuing ſpring.</p>

                  <p>COUNTY is divided by a range of mountains, ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weſtward from Hudſon's river, called the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands. On the north ſide, the lands are very broken, but fertile, and inhabited by Scotch, Iriſh, and Engliſh preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians. The ſociety's miſſionary in Ulſter preaches here ſometimes to a ſmall congregation of the epiſcopal perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which is the only one in the county. Their villages are Goſhen, Bethlehem, and Little Britain, all remarkable for producing, in general, the beſt butter made in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony. The people on the ſouth ſide of the mountains are all Dutch: and Orange town, more commonly called by the Indian name Tappan; is a ſmall but very pleaſant inland vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, with a ſtone court-houſe and church. The militia con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of about thirteen hundred fighting men.</p>
                  <p>This county joins to the province of New-Jerſey on the ſouth; and the non-ſettlement of the partition-line has been the greateſt obſtruction to its growth.</p>
                  <p>There is a very valuable tract, called the Drowned Lands, on the north ſide of the mountains, containing about 40 or 50,000 acres. The waters, which deſcend from the ſurrounding hills, being but ſlowly diſcharged by the river iſſuing out of it, cover theſe vaſt meadows every win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and hence they become extremely fertile. The fires kindled up in the woods by the deer hunters in autumn, are communicated by the leaves to theſe meadows, before the waters riſe above the channel of the river, and a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

                  <p>The mountains, in the county of Orange, are clothed thick with timber, and abound with iron ore, ponds, and fine ſtreams for iron works. Coſhen is well ſupplied with white cedar, and in ſome parts of the woods is found great plenty of black walnut.</p>
                  <p>Before I proceed to the deſcription of the ſouthern coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, I beg leave to ſay a few words concerning Hudſon's river.</p>
                  <p>Its ſource has not, as yet, been diſcovered. We know, in general, that it is in the mountainous, uninhabited coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, between the lakes Ontario and Champlain. In its courſe ſouthward, it approaches the Mohawk's river with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few miles at Saucondauga. From thence it runs north and north-eaſterly towards lake St. Sacrament, now called lake George, and is not above 8 or 10 miles diſtant from it. The courſe then to New-York is very uniform, being in the main ſouth 12 or 15° weſt.</p>
                  <p>The diſtance from Albany to lake George is computed at 65 miles. The river, in that interval, is navigable only to batteaus, and interrupted by rifts, which occaſion two portages, of half a mile each<note n="*" place="bottom">In the paſſage from Albany to fort Edward, the whole land carriage is about twelve or thirteen miles.</note>. There are three routes from Crown Point to Hudſon's river, in the way to Albany; one through lake George, another through a branch of lake Champlain, bearing a ſouthern courſe, and terminating in a baſon, ſeveral miles eaſt of lake George, called the South bay. The third is by aſcending the Wood Creek, a ſhallow ſtream about one hundred feet broad, which, coming from
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:024800_0216_0FCD64152DA5BEC8"/>the ſouth-eaſt, empties itſelf into the ſouth branch of the lake Champlain.</p>
                  <p>The place, where theſe routes meet, on the banks of Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's river, is called the carrying place. Here fort Lyman, ſince called fort Edward, is built: but ſort William Henry, a much ſtronger garriſon, was erected at the ſouth end of lake George, after the repulſe of the French forces under the command of baron Dieſkau, on the 8th of September, 1755. General Shirley thought it more adviſable, to ſtrengthen fort Edward, in the concurrence of three routes, than to erect the other at lake George, 17 miles to the northward of it, and wrote a very preſſing letter upon that head to ſir William Johnſon who then commanded the provincial troops.</p>
                  <p>The banks of Hudſon's river are, for the moſt part, rocky cliffs, eſpecially on the weſtern ſhore. The paſſage through the highlands, affords a wild, romantic ſcene, for ſixteen miles, through ſteep and lofty mountains. The tide flows a few miles above Albany. The navigation is ſafe, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in ſloops of about 40 or 50 tons burden, extremely well accommodated to the river. About ſixty miles above the city of New-York, the water is freſh, and, in wet ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, much lower. The river is ſtored with variety of fiſh, which renders a ſummer's paſſage to Albany, exceedingly diverting to ſuch as are fond of angling.</p>
                  <p>The advantages of this river for penetrating into Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, and protecting the ſouthern colonies from the irrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the French, by ſecuring the command of the lakes, and cutting off the communication between the French ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements on St. Lawrence and the Miſſiſſippi, though but lately attended to, muſt be very apparent to every judicious obſerver of the maps of the inland part of North America.</p>
                  <p>The French, as appears from the intended invaſion, in 1689, have long eyed the Engliſh poſſeſſion of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince with jealouſy; and it becomes us to fall upon every method for its protection and defence.</p>
                  <p>The ſingular conveniency of Hudſon's river to this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince in particular, was ſo fully ſhown in one of the late papers, publiſhed in 1753, under the title of the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Reflector, that I cannot help reprinting the paſſage relating to it.</p>
                  <p>"High roads, which, in moſt trading countries, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely expenſive, and awake a continual attention for their reparation, demand from us, comparatively ſpeaking, ſcarce any public notice at all. The whole province is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in two narrow oblongs, extending from the city eaſt

This is one of the ſtrongeſt motives to the ſettlement of a new country, as it affords the eaſieſt and moſt ſpeedy conveyance from the remoteſt diſtances, and at the loweſt expenſe. The effects of this advantage are greater than we uſually obſerve, and are therefore not ſufficiently admired.</p>
                  <p>"The province of Pennſylvania has a fine ſoil, and through the importation of Germans, abounds with inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants; but being a vaſt inland country, its produce muſt, of conſequence, be brought to a market over a great extent of ground, and all by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Not a boat in our river is navigated with more than two, or three men at moſt; and theſe are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually coming in from, and returning to, all parts of the adjacent country, in the ſame employments, that fill the city of Philadelphia with ſome hundreds of men, who, in reſpect to the public advantage, may juſtly be ſaid, to be laboriouſly idle: for, let any one nicely compute the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe of a waggon, with its tackling; the time of two men in attending it; their maintenance; four horſes, and the charge of their provender, on a journey of one, though they often come, two hundred miles; and he will find, theſe ſeveral particulars amount to a ſum far from being inconſiderable. All this time, the New York farmer is in the courſe of his proper buſineſs, and the unincumbered acquiſitions of his calling; for, at a medium, there is ſcarce a farmer in the province, that cannot tranſport the fruits of a year's labour, from the beſt farm, in three days at a proper ſeaſon, to ſome convenient landing, where the market will be to his ſatisfaction, and all the wants from the merchant, cheaply ſupplied; beſides which, one boat ſhall ſteal into the harbour of New York, with a lading of more burden and value, than forty waggons, one hundred and ſixty horſes, and eighty men, into Philadelphia; and perhaps with leſs noiſe, bluſter, or ſhow than one.</p>
                  <p>"Prodigious is the advantage we have in this article
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:024800_0218_0FCD64181B5F7240"/>alone, I ſhall not enter into an abſtruſe calculation, to evince the exact value of it, in all the lights in which it may be conſidered. Thus much is certain, that barely on account of our eaſy carriage, the profits of farming with us, exceed thoſe in Pennſylvania, at leaſt by thirty per cent. and that differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in favour of our farmers, is of itſelf ſufficient to enrich them; while the others find the diſadvantage they are expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to, ſo heavy, (eſpecially the remote inhabitants of their country) that a bare ſubſiſtence is all they can reaſonably hope to obtain. Take this province throughout, the expenſe of tranſporting a buſhel of wheat, is but two pence for the diſtance of one hundred miles: but the ſame quantity, at a like diſtance in Pennſylvania, will always exceed us one ſhilling at leaſt. The proportion between us, in the conveyance of every thing elſe, is nearly the ſame. How great, then, are the incumbrances to which they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed! What an immenſe charge is ſaved to us! how ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible muſt the embarraſſments they are ſubject to, be to a trading people!"</p>

               <p>THIS province is not ſo populous as ſome have imagined. Scarce a third part of it is under cultivation. The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony of Connecticut, which is vaſtly inferior to this in its extent, contains, according to a late authentic enquiry, above 133,000 inhabitants, and has a militia of 27,000 men; but the militia of New-York, according to the general eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, does not exceed 18,000. The whole number of ſouls is computed at 100,000.</p>

Many have been the diſcouragements to the ſetlement of this colony. The French and Indian irruptions, to which we have always been expoſed, have driven many families into New-Jerſey. At home, the Britiſh acts for the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſportation of felons, have brought all the American colonies into diſcredit with the induſtrious and honeſt poor, both in the kingdoms of Great-Britain and Ireland. The miſchievous tendency of thoſe laws was ſhown in a late paper, which it may not be improper to lay before the reader<note n="*" place="bottom">The independent reflector.</note>.</p>
               <p>"It is too well known, that in purſuance of divers acts of parliament, great numbers of fellows who have forfeited their lives to the public, for the moſt atrocious crimes, are annually tranſported from home to theſe plantations.

                  </gap>d of the moſt flagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious banditti upon earth, ſhould be ſent as agreeable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions to us! That the ſupreme legiſlature did intend a tranſportation to America, for a puniſhment of theſe vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains, I verily believe: but ſo great is the miſtake, that confident I am, they are thereby, on the contrary, highly rewarded. For what, in God's name, can be more agreeable to a penurious wretch, driven, through neceſſity, to ſeek a livelihood by breaking of houſes, and robbing upon the king's highway, than to be ſaved from the halter, redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the ſtench of a jail, and tranſported, paſſage free, into a country, where, being unknown, no man can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him with his crimes; where labour is high, a little of which will maintain him; and where all his expenſes will be moderate and low. There is ſcarce a thief in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, that would not rather be tranſported than hanged. Life in any condition, but that of extreme miſery, will be preferred to death. As long, therefore, as there remains this wide door of eſcape, the number of thieves and robbers at home, will perpetually multiply, and their depredations be inceſſantly reiterated.</p>
               <p>"But the acts were intended, for the better peopling the colonies. And will thieves and murderers be conducive to that end? what advantage can we reap from a colony of unreſtrainable renegadoes? will they exalt the glory of the crown? or rather, will not the dignity of the moſt illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous monarch in the world, be ſullied by a province of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſo lawleſs, deteſtable, and ignominious? can agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be promoted, when the wild boar of the foreſt breaks
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:024800_0222_0FCD6420C5B54208"/>down our hedges and pulls up our vines? will trade flouriſh, or manufactures be encouraged, where property is made the ſpoil of ſuch who are too idle to work, and wicked enough to murder and ſteal?</p>
               <p>"Beſides, are we not ſubjects of the ſame king, with the people of England—members of the ſame body politic, and therefore entitled to equal privileges with them? if ſo, how injurious does it ſeem to free one part of the dominions, from the plagues of mankind, and caſt them upon another? Should a law be propoſed, to take the poor of one pariſh, and billet them upon another, would not all the world, but the pariſh to be relieved, exclaim againſt ſuch a project, as iniquitous and abſurd? Should the numberleſs villains of London and Weſtminſter be ſuffered to eſcape from their priſons, to range at large, and depreda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And though the hardſhips upon us, are indeed not equal to thoſe, yet the miſeries that flow from laws, by no means intended to prejudice us, are too heavy, not to be felt. But the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies muſt be peopled. Agreed: and will the tranſportation acts ever have that tendency? no, they work the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way, and counteract their own deſign. We want people, 'tis true, but not villains, ready at any time, encouraged by impanity, and habituated upon the flighteſt occaſions, to our a man's throat, for a ſmall part of his property. The delights of ſuch company, is a noble inducement, indeed, to the honeſt poor, to convey themſelves into a ſtrange country.

They came over in ſearch of happineſs; rather than ſtarve, will live any where, and would be glad to be excuſed from ſo afflicting an antepart of the torments of hell. In reality, ſir, theſe very laws, though otherwiſe deſigned, have turned out, in the end, the moſt effectual expedients that the art of man could have contrived, to prevent the ſettlement of theſe remote parts of the king's dominions. They have actually taken away almoſt every encouragement to ſo laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a deſign. I appeal to facts.

<pb n="228" facs="unknown:024800_0223_0FCD6421CE719220"/>more terrible herd of exiled malefactors. There are thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of honeſt men, labouring in Europe, at four pence a day, ſtarving in ſpite of all their efforts, a dead weight to the reſpective pariſhes to which they belong; who, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other qualifications than common ſenſe, health, and ſtrength, might accumulate eſtates among us, as many have done already. Theſe, and not the others, are the men that ſhould be ſent over, for the better peopling the planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Great-Britain and Ireland, in their preſent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, are overſtocked with them; and he who would immortalize himſelf, for a lover of mankind, ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert a ſcheme for the tranſportation of the induſtriouſly honeſt abroad, and the immediate puniſhment of rogues and plunderers at home. The pale-faced, half-clad, meagre, and ſtarved ſkeletons, that are ſeen in every village of thoſe kingdoms, call loudly for the patriot's generous aid. The plantations, too, would thank him for his aſſiſtance, in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the repeal of thoſe laws, which, though otherwiſe intended by the legiſlature, have ſo unhappily proved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to his own country, and ruinous to us.—It is not long ſince a bill paſſed the commons, for the employment of ſuch criminals in his majeſty's docks, as ſhould merit the gallows. The deſign was good. It is conſiſtent with ſound policy, that all thoſe, who have forfeited their liberty and lives to their country, ſhould be compelled to labour the reſidue of their days in its ſervice. But the ſcheme was bad, and wiſely was the bill rejected by the lords, for this only reaſon, that it had a natural tendency to diſcredit the king's yards: the conſequences of which muſt have been prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the whole nation. Juſt ſo ought we to reaſon in the preſent caſe; and we ſhould then ſoon be brought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that though peopling the colonies, which was the laudable motive of the legiſlature, be expedient to the public; abrogating the tranſportation laws, muſt be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary</p>
               <p>The bigotry and tyranny of ſome of our governors, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the great extent of their grants, may alſo be conſidered among the diſcouragements againſt the full ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of the province. Moſt of theſe gentlemen com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over with no other view than to raiſe their own fortunes, iſſued extravagant patents, charged with ſmall quit rents, to ſuch as were able to ſerve them in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly: and theſe patentees being generally men of eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, have rated their lands ſo exorbitantly high, that very few poor perſons could either purchaſe or leaſe them. Add to all theſe, that the New-England planters have always been diſaffected to the Dutch, nor was there, after the ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:024800_0224_0FCD6423AAC23290"/>any foreign acceſſion from the Netherlands. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince being thus poorly inhabited, the price of labour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo enormouſly enhanced, that we have been conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to import negroes from Africa, who are employed in all kinds of ſervitude and trades.</p>
               <p>Engliſh is the moſt prevailing language among us, but not a little corrupted by the Dutch dialect, which is ſtill ſo much uſed in ſome counties, that the ſheriffs find it difficult to obtain perſons ſufficiently acquainted with the Engliſh tongue, to ſerve as jurors in the courts of law.</p>
               <p>The manners of the people differ, as well as their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. In Suffolk and Queen's county, the firſt ſettlers of which were either natives of England, or the immediate deſcendants of ſuch as began the plantations in the eaſtern colonies, their cuſtoms are ſimilar to thoſe prevailing in the Engliſh counties, from whence they originally ſprang. In the city of New-York, through our intercourſe with Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, we follow the London faſhions; though, by the time we adopt them, they become diſuſed in England. Our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence during the late war, introduced a degree of luxury in tables, dreſs and furniture, with which we were before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted. But ſtill we are not ſo gay a people as our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours at Boſton and ſeveral of the ſouthern colonies. The Dutch counties, in ſome meaſure, follow the example of New-York, but ſtill retain many modes peculiar to the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers.</p>
               <p>The city of New-York conſiſts principally of merchants, ſhopkeepers, and tradeſmen, who ſuſtain the reputation of honeſt, punctual and fair dealers. With reſpect to riches, there is not ſo great an inequality among us, as is common in Boſton, and in ſome other places. Every man of induſtry and integrity has it in his power to live well, and many are the inſtances of perſons, who came here diſtreſſed by their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, who now enjoy eaſy and plentiful fortunes.</p>
               <p>New-York is one of the moſt ſocial places on the contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. The men collect themſelves into weekly evening clubs. The ladies, in winter, are frequently entertained either at concerts of muſic or aſſemblies, and make a very good ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. They are comely, and dreſs well; and ſcarce any of them have diſtorted ſhapes. Tinctured with a Dutch edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, they manage their families with becoming parſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, good providence, and ſingular neatneſs. The prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of extravagant gaming, common to the faſhionable part of the fair ſex, in ſome places, is a vice with which my countrywomen cannot juſtly be charged. There is nothing they ſo generally neglect, as reading, and indeed all the arts
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:024800_0225_0FCD6425AFB3D290"/>for the improvement of the mind, in which, I confeſs, we have ſet them the example. They are modeſt, temperate, and charitable; naturally ſprightly, ſenſible, and good-hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured; and, by the help of a more elevated education, would poſſeſs all the accompliſhments deſirable in the ſex. Our ſchools are in the loweſt order; the inſtructors want inſtruction, and through a long, ſhameful neglect of all the arts and ſciences, our common ſpeech is extremely corrupt; and the evidences of a bad taſte, both as to thought and language, are viſible in all our proceedings, public and private.</p>
               <p>The people, both in town and country, are ſober, induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious, and hoſpitable, though intent upon gain. The richer ſort keep very plentiful tables, abounding with great varieties of fleſh, fiſh, fowl, and all kinds of vegetables. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon drinks are beer, cyder, weak punch, and Madeira wine. For deſert, we have fruits in vaſt plenty, of different kinds and various ſpecies.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of eſtates rarely reſide in the country, and hence few or no experiments have yet been made in agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The farms being large, our huſbandmen, for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, have little recourſe to art for manuring and improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their lands; but it is ſaid, that nature has furniſhed us with ſufficient helps, whenever neceſſity calls us to uſe them. It is much owing to the diſproportion between the number of our inhabitants, and the vaſt tracts remaining ſtill to be ſettled, that we have, as yet, entered, upon ſcarce any other manufactures, than ſuch as are indiſpenſibly neceſſary for our home convenience. Felt-making, which is perhaps the moſt natural of any we could fall upon, was begun ſome years ago; and hats were exported to the Weſt Indies with great ſucceſs, till lately prohibited by an act of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The inhabitants of this colony are in general healthy and robuſt, taller but ſhorter lived than Europeans, and, both with reſpect to their minds and bodies, arrive ſooner to an age of maturity. Breathing a ſerene, dry air, they are more ſprightly in their natural tempers, than the people of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and hence inſtances of ſuicide are here very uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. The hiſtory of our diſeaſes belongs to a profeſſion with which I am very little acquainted. Few phyſicians amongſt us are eminent for their ſkill. Quacks abound like locuſts in Egypt: and too many have recommended themſelves to a full practice and profitable ſubſiſtence. This is the leſs to be wondered at, as the profeſſion is under no kind of regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Load as the call is, to our ſhame be it remembered,
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:024800_0226_0FCD6427D0A79490"/>we have no law to protect the lives of the king's ſubjects, from the malpractice of pretenders.

No candidates are either examined or licenſed, or even ſworn to fair practice<note n="*" place="bottom">The neceſſity of regulating the practice of phyſic, and a plan for that purpoſe, were ſtrongly recommended by the author of the independent reflector, in 1753, when the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of New-York alone boaſted the honour of having above forty gentlemen of that faculty.</note> The natural hiſtory of this province would of itſelf furniſh a ſmall volume, and therefore I leave this alſo to ſuch, as have capacity and leiſure to make uſeful ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, in that curious and entertaining branch of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral philoſophy.</p>

               <p>THE ſituation of New-York with reſpect to foreign mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, for reaſons elſewhere aſſigned, is to be preferred to any of our colonies. It lies in the centre of the Britiſh plantations on the continent, has at all times a ſhort, eaſy acceſs to the ocean, and commands almoſt the whole trade of Connecticut and New-Jerſey, two fertile and well-cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated colonies. The projection of Cape Cod into the Atlantic, renders the navigation from the former to Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, at ſome ſeaſons, extremely perilous; and ſometimes the coaſters are driven off, and compelled to winter in the Weſt-Indies. But the conveyance to New-York, from the eaſtward through the ſound, is ſhort and unexpoſed to ſuch dangers. Philadelphia receives as little advantage from New-Jerſey, as Boſton from Connecticut, becauſe the only rivers which roll through that province, diſembogue not many miles from the very city of New-York. Several at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts have been made to raiſe Perth Amboy into a trading port; but hitherto it has proved to be an unfeaſible project. New-York, all things conſidered, has a much better ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and were it otherwiſe, the city has become too rich and conſiderable, to be eclipſed by any other town in its neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood.</p>

In our traffic with other places, the balance is almoſt conſtantly in our favour. Our exports to the Weſt Indies are bread, peaſe, rye-meal, Indian corn, apples, oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, boards, ſtaves, horſes, ſheep, butter, cheeſe, pickled oyſters, beef, and pork. Flour is alſo a main article, of which there is ſhipped about 80,000 barrels per annum. To preſerve the credit of this important branch of our ſtaple, we have a good law, appointing officers to inſpect and brand every caſk before its exportation. The returns are chiefly rum, ſugar, and melaſſes, except caſh from Cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Spaniards commonly contract for proviſions, with merchants in this and the colony of Pennſylvania, very much to the advantage both of the contractors and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, becauſe the returns are wholly in caſh.

               <p>The logwood trade to the bay of Honduras is very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, and was puſhed by our merchants with great bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the moſt dangerous times. The exportation of flax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed to Ireland is of late very much increaſed. Between the 9th of December 1755, and the 23d of February following, we ſhipped off 12, 528 hogſheads.

The French fur trade, at Albany, was carried on till the ſummer 1755; by the Caghnuaga proſelytes; and in return for their peltry, they received Spaniſh pieces of eight, and ſome other arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which the French want, to complete their aſſortment of Indian goods. For the ſavages prefer the Engliſh ſtrouds to theirs: and the French found it their intereſt to purchaſe them of us, and tranſport them to the weſtern Indians on the lakes Erie, Huron, and at the ſtreight of Miſſilima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinac.</p>
               <p>Our importation of dry goods from England is ſo vaſtly great, that we are obliged to betake ourſelves to all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble arts, to make remittances to the Britiſh merchants. It is for this purpoſe we import cotton from St. Thomas's and Surinam—lime-juice and Nicaragua wood from Curacoa—and logwood from the bay, &amp;c. and yet it drains us of all the ſilver and gold we can collect. It is computed, that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual amount of the goods purchaſed by this colony in Great Britain, is in value not leſs than 100,000<abbr>l.</abbr> ſterling; and the ſum would be much greater, if a ſtop was put to all clandeſtine trade. England is, doubtleſs, entitled to all our ſuperfluities; becauſe our general intereſts are cloſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected, and her navy is our principal defence. On this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, the trade with Hamburgh and Holland for duck, chequered linen, oznabrigs, cordage, and tea, is certainly, upon the whole, impolitic and unreaſonable; how much ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may conduce to advance the intereſt of a few mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, or this particular colony.</p>
               <p>By what meaſures this contraband trade may be effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſtructed, is hard to determine, though it well deſerves the attention of a Britiſh parliament. Increaſing the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of cuſtom-houſe officers, will be a remedy worſe than the diſeaſe. Their ſalaries would be an additional charge upon the public; for if we argue from their conduct, we ought not to preſume upon their fidelity. The excluſive right of the Eaſt-India company to import tea, while the colonies purchaſe it of foreigners 30 per cent. cheaper, muſt be very prejudicial to the nation. Our people, both in town and country, are ſhamefully gone into the habit of tea-drinking: and it is ſuppoſed we conſume of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity in value near 10,000<abbr>l.</abbr> ſterling per annum.</p>

Some are of opinion, that the fiſhery of ſturgeons; which abound in Hudſon's river, might be improved to the great advantage of the colony; and that, if proper meaſures were concerted, much profit would ariſe from ſhip-building and naval ſtores. It is certain we have timber in vaſt plenty, oak, white and black pines, fir, locuſt, red and white mulberry, and cedar; and perhaps there is no ſoil on the globe, fitter for the production of hemp, than the low lands in the county of Albany. To what I have already ſaid concerning iron ore, a neceſſary article, I ſhall add an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from the independent reflector.</p>
               <p>"It is generally believed, that this province abounds with a variety of minerals. Of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ron in particular we have ſuch plenty, as to be excelled by no country in the world of equal extent. It is a metal of intrinſic value beyond any other, and preferable to the pureſt gold. The former is converted into numberleſs forms, for as many indiſpenſible uſes; the latter, for its portableneſs and ſcarcity, is only fit for a medium of trade: but iron is a branch of it, and I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, will, one time or other, be one of the moſt valuable articles of our commerce. Our annual exports to Boſton, Rhode-Iſland, and Connecticut, and, ſince the late act of parliament, to England, are far from being inconſiderable. The bodies of iron ore, in the northern parts of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, are ſo many, their quality ſo good, and their ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo convenient, in reſpect of wood, water, hearth-ſtone, proper fluxes, and carriage, for furnaces, bloomeries, and forges, that with a little attention we might very ſoon rival the Swedes in the produce of this article. If any American attempts in iron works have proved abortive, and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed their undertakers, it is not to be imputed either to the quality of the ore, or a defect of conveniences. The want of more workmen, and the villainy of thoſe we gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally have, are the only cauſes to which we muſt attribute ſuch miſcarriages. No man, who has been concerned in them will diſagree with me, if I aſſert, that from the founder of the furnace to the meaneſt bankſm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>, or jobber, they are uſually low, profligate, drunken, and faithleſs. And yet, under all the innumerable diſadvantages of ſuch inſtruments, very large eſtates have, in this way, been raiſed in ſome of our colonies. Our ſucceſs, therefore, in the iron manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, is obſtructed and diſcouraged by the want of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and the high price of labour, its neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and by theſe alone; but 'tis our happineſs, that ſuch only being the cauſe, the means of redreſs are entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in our own hands. Nothing more is wanting to open a
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:024800_0230_0FCD6432A1A10628"/>vaſt ſund of riches to the province, in this branch of trade, than the importation of foreigners. If our merchants and landed gentlemen could be brought to a coalition in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, their private intereſts would not be better advanced by it, than the public emolument; the latter, in particular, would thereby vaſtly improve their lands, increaſe the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and raiſe the rents of their tenants. And I cannot but think, that if thoſe gentlemen, who are too inactive to engage in ſuch an enterpriſe, would only be at the pains of drawing up full repreſentations of their advantages for iron works, and of publiſhing them from time to time, in Great-Britain, Ireland, Germany, and Sweden; the province would ſoon be ſupplied, with a ſufficient number of capable workmen in all the branches of that manufactory."</p>
               <p>The money uſed in this province is ſilver, gold, Britiſh halfpence, and bills of credit. To counterfeit either of them is felony without benefit of clergy; but none, except the latter, and Lion dollars, are a legal tender. Twelve half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, till lately, paſſed for a ſhilling; which being much beyond their value in any of the neighbouring colonies, the aſſembly, in 1753, reſolved to proceed, at their next meeting, after the 1ſt of May enſuing, to the conſideration of a method for aſcertaining their value. A ſet of gentlemen, in number ſeventy-two, took the advantage of the diſcredit that reſolve put upon copper halfpence, and on the 22d of December, ſubſcribed a paper, engaging not to receive or paſs them, except at the rate of fourteen coppers to a ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. This gave riſe to a mob, for a few days, among the lower claſs of people; but ſome of them being impriſoned, the ſcheme was carried into execution, and eſtabliſhed in every part of the province, without the aid of a law. Our paper bills, which are iſſued to ſerve the exigencies of the government, were at firſt equal to an ounce of ſilver, then valued at eight ſhillings. Before the late Spaniſh war, ſilver and gold were in great demand, to make remittances for Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean goods, and then the bills ſunk, an ounce of ſilver be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worth nine ſhillings and three pence. During the war, the credit of our bills was well ſupported, partly by the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of prizes taken by our privateers, and the high price of our produce abroad; and partly by the logwood trade and the depreciation of the New-England paper money, which gave ours a free circulation through the eaſtern colonies. Since the war, ſilver has been valued at about nine ſhillings and two pence an ounce, and is doubtleſs fixed there, till our imports exceed what we export. To aſſiſt his majeſty for removing the late encroachments of the French, we have
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:024800_0231_0FCD6434415B1B60"/>iſſued 80,000<abbr>l.</abbr> to be ſunk in ſhort periods, by a tax on eſtates real and perſonal; and the whole amount of our paper cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency is thought to be about 160,000<abbr>l.</abbr>
               </p>
               <p>Never was the trade of this province in ſo flouriſhing a condition, as at the latter end of the late French war. Above twenty privateers were often out of this port at a time; and they were very ſucceſsful in their captures. Proviſions, which are our ſtaple. bore a high price in the Weſt Indies. The French, diſtreſſed through a want of them, gladly received our flags of truce, though ſometimes they had but one or two priſoners on board, becauſe they were always loaded with flour, beef, pork, and ſuch like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities. The danger their own veſſels were expoſed to, induced them to ſell their ſugars to us at a very low rate. A trade was, at the ſame time, carried on between Jamaica and the Spaniſh main, which opened a fine market to the northern colonies, and the returns were, principally, in caſh. It was generally thought, that if the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>Of our religious ſtate.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>BY the acount already given, of the riſe and progreſs of the acts for ſettling a miniſtry in four counties, and the obſervations made concerning our various chriſtian denominations, I have in a great meaſure anticipated what I at firſt intended to have ranged under this head.</p>
               <p>The principal diſtinctions among us, are the epiſcopali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and the Dutch and Engliſh preſbyterians; the two laſt, together with all the other proteſtants in he colony, are ſometimes (perhaps here improperly) called by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral name of diſſenters; and, compared to them, the epiſcopalians are, I believe, ſcarce in the proportion of one to fifteen. Hence partly ariſes the general diſcontent on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the miniſtry acts; not ſo much that the proviſion
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:024800_0232_0FCD64356665CDB0"/>made by them is engroſſed by the minor ſect, as becauſe the body of the people are for an equal, univerſal tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of proteſtants, and utterly averſe to any kind of eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical eſtabliſhment. The diſſenters, though fearleſs of each other, are all jealous of the epiſcopal party, being apprehenſive that the countenance they may have from home, will foment a luſt for dominion, and enable them, in proceſs of time, to ſubjugate and oppreſs their fellow ſubjects. The violent meaſures of ſome of our governors have given an alarm to their fears; and if ever any other gentleman, who may be honoured with the chief command of the province, begins to divert himſelf, by retrenching the privileges and immunities they now enjoy, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of the province will be the unavoidable conſequence of his folly. For though his majeſty has no other ſubjects upon whoſe loyalty he can more firmly depend, yet an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of perſecution, under any of its appearances, is ſo deeply rooted in the people of this plantation; that as long as they continue their numbers and intereſt in the aſſembly, no attempt will probably be made upon the rights of conſcience, without endangering the public repoſe.</p>
               <p>Of the government of the Dutch churches, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given an account. As to the epiſcopal clergy, they are miſſionaries of the Engliſh ſociety for propagating the goſpel, and ordinarily ordained by the biſhop of London, who, having a commiſſion from the king to exerciſe eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical juriſdiction, commonly appoints a clergyman here for his commiſſary. The miniſters are called by the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular churches, and maintained by the voluntary contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their auditors and the ſociety's annual allowance, there being no law for tythes.</p>
               <p>The Engliſh preſbyterians are very numerous. Thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting New York, New Jerſey, Pennſylvania, and the three Delaware counties, are regularly formed, after the manner of the church of Scotland, into conſiſtories or kirk ſeſſions, preſbyteries and ſynods, and will probably ſoon join in erecting a general aſſembly. The clergy are ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their fellows, and maintained by their reſpective congregations. I except thoſe miſſionaries among the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, whoſe ſubſiſtence is paid by the ſociety in Scotland for propagating chriſtian knowledge. None of the preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian churches in this province are incorporated, as is the caſe of many in New Jerſey. Their judicatories are upon a very proper eſtabliſhment, for they have no authority by legal ſanctions to enforce their decrees. Nor indeed is
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:024800_0233_0FCD6436D3BB21D8"/>any religious ſect, among us, legally inveſted with powerd prejudicial to the common privileges of the reſt. The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of all our clergy is, as it ought to be, merely ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual. The epiſcopalians, however, ſometimes pretend, that the eccleſiaſtical eſtabliſhment in South Britain extends here; but the whole body of the diſſenters are averſe to the doctrine. The point has been diſputed with great fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and the ſum of the arguments againſt it is contained in a late paper, which I ſhall lay before the reader, at large, without any additional refle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Whether the church of England is equally eſtabliſhed in the colonies, as in the ſouthern parts of Great Britain, is a queſtion that has often been controverted. Thoſe who hold the affirmative, have drawn a long train of conſequences in favour of the epiſcopalians, taking it for granted, that the truth is on their ſide. The preſbyterians, independents, congregationaliſts, anabaptiſts, quakers, and all thoſe among us, who, in England, would fall under the general denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of diſſenters, are warm in the negative. I beg leăve, therefore, to interpoſe in the debate; and as I promiſed, in the introduction to theſe papers, to vindicate the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, as well as civil rights and privileges of my country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; I ſhall devote this paper to a conſideration of ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant a point: to which I am the more ſtrongly inclined, becauſe ſuch eſtabliſhment has often been urged againſt the ſcheme I have propoſed for the conſtitution of our college. My opinion is, that the notion of a general religious eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment in this province, is entirely groundleſs. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſtrict rules of controverſy, the <hi>onus probandi,</hi> or the burden of the proof, lies upon thoſe who affirm the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; and it would therefore be ſufficient for me barely to deny it. I ſhall, nevertheleſs, wave the advantage of this rule of the ſchools; and, as becomes an impartial advocate for truth, proceed to ſtate the arguments, which are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally urged in ſupport of an eſtabliſhment. I ſhall then ſhow
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:024800_0234_0FCD64384D5813A0"/>their inſufficiency, and conclude with the particular reaſons upon which my opinion is founded.</p>
               <p>They who aſſert, that the church of England is eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this province, never, that I have heard of, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that it owes its eſtabliſhment to any provincial law of our own making. Nor, indeed, is there the leaſt ground for ſuch a ſuppoſition. The acts, that eſtabliſh a miniſtry in this, and three other counties, do not affect the whole co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony; and therefore can by no means be urged in ſupport of a general eſtabliſhment. Nor were they originally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to eſtabliſh the epiſcopalians in preference or exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of any other proteſtants in thoſe counties to which they are limited. But as the propoſition is, that the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the church of England is equally binding here, as in England; ſo, agreeable thereto, the arguments they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce are the following:</p>
               <p>Firſt, That as we are an Engliſh colony, the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional laws of our mother country, antecedent to the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature of our own, are binding upon us; and therefore at the planting of this colony, the Engliſh religious eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment immediately took place.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the act, which eſtabliſhed the epiſcopal church in South Britain, previous to the union of England and Scotland, extends to, and equally affects, all the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the only arguments that can be offered with the leaſt plauſibility; and if they are ſhown to be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive, the poſition is diſproved, and the arguments, of conſequence, muſt be impertinent and groundleſs. I ſhall begin with the examination of the firſt: and here it muſt be confeſſed, for undoubted law, that every new colony, till it has a legiſlature of its own, is, in general, ſubject to the laws of the country from which it originally ſprang. But that all of them, without diſtinction, are to be ſuppoſed binding upon ſuch planters, is neither agreeable to law nor reaſon. The laws which they carry with them, and to which they are ſubject, are ſuch as are abſolutely neceſſary to anſwer the original intention of our entering into a ſtate of ſociety—ſuch as are requiſite, in their new colony ſtate, for the advancement of their and the general proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity —ſuch, without which they will neither be protected in their lives, liberty, or property: and the true reaſon of their being conſidered, even ſubject to ſuch laws, ariſes from the abſolute neceſſity of their being under ſome kind of government, their ſupporting a colony relation and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and the evident fitneſs of their ſubjection to the
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:024800_0235_0FCD643D576931D0"/>laws of their mother country, with which alone they can be ſuppoſed to be acquainted. Even at this day, we extend every general act of parliament which we think reaſonable and ſit for us, though it was neither deſigned to be a law upon us, nor has words to include us, and has even been enacted long ſince we had a legiſlature of our own. This is a prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice we have introduced for our conveniency<note n="*" place="bottom">This practice is very dangerous, and is aſſuming little leſs than a legiſlative authority.</note>; but that the Engliſh laws, ſo far as I have diſtinguiſhed them, ſhould be binding upon us, antecedent to our having a legiſlature of our own, is of abſolute unavoidable neceſſity. But no ſuch neceſſity can be pretended, in favour of the introduction of any religious eſtabliſhment whatſoever; becauſe, it is evident that different ſocieties do exiſt with different eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical laws, or, which is ſufficient to my purpoſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch as the Engliſh eſtabliſhment; and that civil ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as it is antecedent to any eccleſiaſtical eſtabliſhments, is in its nature unconnected with them, independent of them, and all ſocial happineſs completely attainable without them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To ſuppoſe all the laws of England, without diſtinction, obligatory upon every new colony, at its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plantation, is abſurd, and would effectually prevent the ſubjects from undertaking ſo hazardous an adventure. Upon ſuch a ſuppoſition, a thouſand laws will be introduced, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the ſtate of a new country, and deſtructive of the planters. To uſe the words of the late attorney ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, ſir Dudley Ryder<note n="†" place="bottom">Afterwards lord chief juſtice of the king's bench. Theſe were his words, in an opinion againſt the extent of the ſtatute of frauds and perjuries.</note>, "It would be acting the part of an unſkilful phyſician, who ſhould preſcribe the ſame doſe to every patient, without diſtinguiſhing the variety of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers and conſtitutions." According to this doctrine, we are ſubject to the payment of tythes, ought to have a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual court, and impoveriſhed, as the firſt ſettlers of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince muſt have been, they were yet liable to the payment of the land tax. And had this been the ſenſe of our rulers, and their conduct conformable thereto, ſcarce ever would our colonies have appeared in their preſent flouriſhing condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; eſpecially if it be conſidered, that the firſt ſettlers of moſt of them, ſought an exemption in theſe American wilds, from the eſtabliſhment to which they were ſubject at home.</p>

Thirdly, If the planters of every new colony carry with them the eſtabliſhed religion of the country from whence they migrate; it follows, that if a colony had been planted when the Engliſh nation were pagans, the eſtabliſhment in ſuch colony muſt be paganiſm alone: and, in like manner, had this colony been planted while popery was eſtabliſhed in England, the religion of papiſts muſt have been our eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed religion; and if it is our duty to conform to the religion eſtabliſhed at home, we are equally bound, againſt conſcience and the bible, to be pagans, papiſts, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, according to the particular religion they ſhall pleaſe to adopt. A doctrine that can never be urged, but with a very ill grace indeed, by any proteſtant miniſter.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If the church of England <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> eſtabliſhed in this colony, it muſt either be founded on acts of parliament, or the common law. That it is not eſtabliſhed by the firſt, I ſhall prove in the ſequel; and that it cannot be eſtabliſhed by the common law, appears from the following conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations.</p>
               <p>The common law of England, properly defined, conſiſts of thoſe general laws to which the Engliſh have been accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from time, whereof there is no memory to the contrary: and every law, deriving its validity from ſuch immemorial cuſtom, muſt be carried back as far as to the reign of Richard I. whoſe death happened on the 6th of April 1199. But the preſent eſtabliſhment of the church of England was not till the fifth year of queen Anne. And hence it is apparent, that the eſtabliſhment of the church of England; can never be argued from the common law, even in England; nor could be any part of it, ſince it depends not for its validity upon cuſtom immemorial. And therefore, though it be admitted, that every Engliſh colony is ſubject to the common law of the realm, it by no means follows, that the church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land is eſtabliſhed in the colonies; becauſe, the common law knows of no ſuch religious eſtabliſhment, nor conſiders any religious eſtabliſhment whatever, as any part of the Engliſh conſtitution. It does, indeed, encourage religion; but that, and a particular church government, are things entirely different.</p>
               <p>I proceed now to a conſideration of the ſecond argument inſiſted on, to prove an epiſcopal eſtabliſhment <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And that this act does not eſtabliſh the church of England in the colonies, has been ſo fully
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:024800_0237_0FCD643FD1E67560"/>ſhown by mr. Hobart<note n="*" place="bottom">A miniſter of one of the churches at Fairfield, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut.</note>, in his ſecond addreſs to the epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ſeparation in New England, that I ſhall content myſelf with an extract from the works of that ingenious gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, which, with very little alteration, is as follows:</p>
               <p>"The act we are now diſputing about, was made in the fifth year of queen Anne, and is entitled, an act for ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the church of England, as by law eſtabliſhed. The oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the ſtatute was this: the parliament in Scotland, when treating of an union with England, were apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of its endangering their eccleſiaſtical eſtabliſhment. Scotland was to have but a ſmall ſhare in the legiſlature of Great Britain, but forty-five members in the houſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, which conſiſts of above five hundred; and but ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen in the houſe of lords, which then conſiſted of near an hundred, and might be increaſed by the ſovereign at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. The Scots, therefore, to prevent having their eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical eſtabliſhment repealed in a Britiſh parliament, where they might be ſo eaſily out-voted by the Engliſh members, paſſed an act, previous to the union, eſtabliſhing the preſbyterian church within the kingdom of Scotland, in perpetuity, and made this act an eſſential and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental part of the union, which might not be repealed, or altered by any ſubſequent Britiſh parliament; and this put the Engliſh parliament upon paſſing this act for ſecuring the church of England. Neither of them deſigned to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the bounds of their eccleſiaſtical conſtitution, or extend their eſtabliſhment farther than it reached before, but only to ſecure and perpetuate it, in its then preſent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. This is evident, not only from the occaſion of the act, but from the charitable temper the Engliſh parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was under the influence of, when they paſſed it. The lord North and Grey offered a rider to be added to the bill for an union, viz. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> it might not extend to an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation or acknowledgment of the truth of the preſbyterian way of worſhip, or allowing the religion of the church of Scotland to be what it is ſtiled, the true proteſtant religion. But this clauſe was rejected. A parliament that would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the religion of the church of Scotland, to be the true proteſtant religion, and allow their acts to extend to an approbation of the preſbyterian way of worſhip, though they might think it beſt to ſecure and perpetuate the church of England within thoſe bounds, wherein it was before
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:024800_0238_0FCD6441693817F0"/>eſtabliſhed, can hardly be ſuppoſed to have deſigned to extend it beyond them.</p>
               <p>"The title of the act is exactly agreeable to what we have ſaid of the deſign of it, and of the temper of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament that paſſed it. 'Tis entitled, an act not for enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but for ſecuring the church of England, and that not in the American plantations, but as it is now by law eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed; which plainly means no more than to perpetuate it within its ancient boundaries.</p>
               <p>"The proviſion, made in the act itſelf, is well adapted to this deſign; for it enacts, that the act of the thirteenth of Elizabeth, and the act of uniformity, paſſed in the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year of Charles II. and all and ſingular other acts of parliament, then in force for the eſtabliſhment and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the church of England, ſhould remain in full force forever; and that every ſucceeding ſovereign ſhould, at his coronation, take and ſubſcribe an oath to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and preſerve inviolably the ſaid ſettlement of the church of England, as by law eſtabliſhed, within the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of England and Ireland, the dominion of Wales, and town of Berwick upon Tweed, and the territories there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto belonging. This act doth not uſe ſuch expreſſions, as would have been proper and even neceſſary, had the deſign been to have made a new eſtabliſhment; but only ſuch as are proper to ratify and confirm an old one. The ſettlement, which the king is ſworn to preſerve, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as exiſting previouſly to the paſſing this act, and not as made by it. The words of the oath are, to maintain and preſerve inviolably the ſaid ſettlement. If it be aſked, what ſettlement? The anſwer muſt be, a ſettlement here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore made and confirmed by certain ſtatutes, which, for the greater certainty and ſecurity, are enumerated in this act, and declared to be unalterable. This is the ſettlement the king is ſworn to preſerve; and this ſettlement has no relation to us in America. For the act, which originally made it, did not reach hither; and this act, which perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates them, does not extend them to us.</p>
               <p>It is a miſtake to imagine, that the word territories ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily means theſe American colonies. "Theſe countries are uſually, in law, as well as other writings, ſtiled colonies or plantations, and not territories. An inſtance of this we have in the charter to the 'ſociety for propaga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing the goſpel in foreign parts." And it is the invariable practice of the legiſlature, in every act of parliament, both before and after this act, deſigned to affect us, to uſe the words colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, or plantations. Nor is it to be ſuppoſed, that, in ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:024800_0239_0FCD6445827F5010"/>a matter, words of ſo direct and broad an intent, would have been omitted. "The iſlands of Jerſey and Guernſey were properly territories belonging to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of England, before the union took place: and they ſtand in the ſame relation to the kingdom of Great Britain ſince. The church of England was eſtabliſhed in theſe iſlands, and the legiſlature intended to perpetuate it in them, as well as in England itſelf; ſo that as theſe iſlands were not particularly named in the act, there was occaſion to uſe the word territories even upon the ſuppoſition, that they did not deſign to make the eſtabliſhment more exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive than it was before this law paſſed." Further, in order to include the plantations in the word territories, we muſt ſuppoſe it always to mean every other part of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions not particularly mentioned in the inſtrument that uſes it, which is a conſtruction that can never be admitted: for, hence it will follow, that thoſe commiſſions, which give the government of a colony, and the territories there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on depending in America (and this is the caſe of every one of them) extend to all the American colonies, and their governors muſt of conſequence have reciprocal ſuperinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies; and ſhould any commiſſion include the word ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories generally, unreſtricted to America, by the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, the governor therein mentioned, might exerciſe an authority under it, not only in America, but in Africa and the Indies, and even in the kingdom of Ireland, and perhaps, in the abſence of the king, in Great-Britain itſelf. Mr. Hobart goes on, and argues againſt the eſtabliſhment, from the light in which the act of union has, ever ſince it was paſſed, been conſidered.</p>
               <p>"Dr. Biſſe, biſhop of Hereford, (ſays he) a member of the ſociety, preached the annual ſermon, February 21, 1717, ten years after the act of union took place; and he ſays, it would have well become the wiſdom wherewith that great work (the reformation or eſtabliſhment of the church of England) was conducted in this kingdom, that this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign enterpriſe (the ſettlement of plantations in America) alſo ſhould have been carried on by the government in the like regular way. But he owns the government at home did not interpoſe in the caſe, or eſtabliſh any form of religion for us. In truth (ſays his lordſhip) the whole was left to the wiſdom of the firſt proprietors, and to the conduct of every private man. He obſerves, that of late years the civil intereſt hath been regarded, and the dependence of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, on the imperial crown of the realm, ſecur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d: but then, with regard to the religion of the plantations, his
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:024800_0240_0FCD644747E12E70"/>lordſhip acknowledges, that the government itſelf here at home, ſovereign as it is, and inveſted, doubtleſs, with ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient authority there, hath not thought fit to interpoſe in this matter, otherwiſe than in this charitable way: it hath enabled us to aſk the benevolence of all good chriſtians, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſupport of miſſionaries to be ſent among them. Thus biſhop Biſſe thought as I do, and that the act of union, nor any other law prior thereto, did extend the eſtabliſhment to the plantations: and if the ſociety had not been of the ſame opinion, they would hardly have printed and diſperſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſermon. Neither did the civil rulers of the nation, who may juſtly be ſuppoſed acquainted with its laws, think the act of union, or any other law, eſtabliſhed the church of England in America. This is plain from the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the lords juſtices to governor Dummer, in the year 1725, almoſt twenty years after the union, wherein they ſay, there is no regular eſtabliſhment of any national or provincial church in theſe plantations.</p>
               <p>"If it be urged, that the king's commiſſion to the late biſhop of London, proves an eccleſiaſtical eſtabliſhment here, it is ſufficient to anſwer, that his lordſhip was remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for ſkill in the laws, ſo far as they relate to eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical affairs, as appears from his codex; and he was of the contrary opinion; for in his letter to dr. Colman, of May 24, 1735, he writes thus: my opinion has always been, that the religious ſtate of New England is founded in an equal liberty to all proteſtants; none of which can claim the name of a national eſtabliſhment, or any kind of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority over the reſt. This opinion the biſhop gave not only ſince the act of union, but even ſeven years after he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his commiſſion; and ſurely it muſt be admitted, that as he had time enough to conſider it, ſo he, of all others, beſt underſtood it." Thus far mr. Hobart. With reſpect to the act of union, I beg leave only to ſubjoin, that it is highly probable, the Scotch parliament believed the Engliſh intended to eſtabliſh their church only in England. For in the cloſe of the act, by which they had eſtabliſhed the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian church in Scotland, it is declared, in theſe expreſs words, "That the parliament of England may provide for the ſecurity of the church of England, as they think ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, to take place within the bounds of the ſaid king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of England." And whatever latitude the word king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom has in common ſpeech, it, in a legal ſenſe, is limited to England, properly ſo called, and excludes the planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="246" facs="unknown:024800_0241_0FCD6448CE5CE140"/>
Nor can we ſuppoſe, that the church of England is eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in theſe colonies, by any acts prior to the act of union above conſidered. For, beſides the ſeveral opinions, againſt ſuch ſuppoſition, already adduced, it is unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to imagine, that if there was any ſuch eſtabliſhment, king Charles II. in direct repugnancy thereto, ſhould have made the grant of Pennſylvania, and given equal privileges to all religions in that province, without even excepting the Roman catholics; and that the colonies of Rhode Iſland, Connecticut, and the Maſſachuſetts bay, ſhould be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to make their provincial eſtabliſhments, in oppoſition to an antecedent eſtabliſhment of the church of England, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially as the laws of the Maſſachuſetts bay province, are conſtantly ſent home, and the king has the abſolute power of repealing every act he ſhould think improper to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued as a law. Whoever, therefore, conſiders this, and that the king is ſworn to preſerve the church of England eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment, muſt neceſſarily conclude, that whatever ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may obtain among the epiſcopalians in America, our kings and their councils have always conceived that ſuch eſtabliſhment could by no means be extended to us. As to Connecticut, all the epiſcopalians of that colony, and even their miniſters, were legally compellable to contribute to an annual tax for the ſupport of the congregational clergy, till of late they were favoured with a law which grants them a privilege of exemption from that iniquitous and unreaſonable burden. But whether they are ſubject to the like unchriſtian impoſition in the other colonies above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, I am not ſufficiently acquainted with their laws to determine.<note n="*" place="bottom">I believe there is no juſt cauſe for the complaints tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the miſſionaries.

Douglaſs in favour of his poſition, that the religious ſtate of the American plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations is an univerſal toleration of proteſtants of every denomination.</p>
               <p>The clergy of this province are, in general, but indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:024800_0242_0FCD644A4F662768"/>ſupported: it is true they live eaſily: but few of them leave any thing to their children. The epiſcopal miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries, for enlarging the ſphere of their ſecular buſineſs, not many years ago, attempted, by a petition to the late governor Clinton, to engroſs the privilege of ſolemnizing all marriages. A great clamoar enſued, and the attempt was abortive. Before that time, the ceremony was even per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by juſtices of the peace, and the judges at law have determined ſuch marriages to be legal. The governor's li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences now run to all "proteſtant miniſters of the goſpel." Whether the juſtices act ſtill, when the bans are publiſhed in our churches, which is cuſtomary only with the poor, I have not been informed. Marriage in a new country ought to have the higheſt encouragements; and it is on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, perhaps, that we have no provincial law againſt ſuch as are clandeſtine, though they often happen, and, in ſome caſes, are attended with conſequences equally melancholy and miſchievous.</p>
               <p>As to the number of our clergymen, it is large enough at preſent, there being but few ſettlements unſupplied with a miniſtry, and ſome ſuperabound. In matters of religion, we are not ſo intelligent in general, as the inhabitants of the New England colonies; but both in this reſpect and good morals, we certainly have the advantage of the ſouthern provinces. One of the king's inſtructions to our governors, recommends the inveſtigation of means for the converſion of negroes and Indians. An attention to both, eſpecially the latter, has been too little regarded. If the miſſionaries of the Engliſh ſociety for propagating the goſpel, inſtead of being ſeated in opulent chriſtianized towns, had been ſent out to preach among the ſavages, unſpeakable political ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages would have flowed from ſuch a ſalutary meaſure.

               <p>The inſtructions, received with the commiſſion, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planatory
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:024800_0252_0FCD645F4D459928"/>of the patent, and regulate the governor's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct on almoſt every common contingency<note n="*" place="bottom">The inſtructions are, in number, above a hundred, and never recorded. They are changeable at the king's plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but rarely undergo any very conſiderable altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>.</p>
               <p>The ſalary, generally granted to the governor by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, is 1200<abbr>l.</abbr> ſterling out of the revenue here; but that being an inſufficient fund, the aſſembly, in lieu of it, give him annually 1560<abbr>l.</abbr> currency. The perquiſites perhaps amount to as much more.</p>
               <p>This office was formerly very lucrative, but becomes daily leſs conſiderable, becauſe almoſt all the valuable tracts of land are already taken up.</p>
               <p>The council, when full, conſiſts of twelve members, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the king's mandamus and ſign manual. All their privileges and powers are contained in the inſtructions. They are a privy council to the governor, in acts of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and take the ſame oath adminiſtered to the king's council in England. The tenure of their places is extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly precarious, and yet their influence upon the public mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures very conſiderable. In the grant of all patents, the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor is bound to conſult them, and regularly they cannot paſs the ſeal without their advice.</p>
               <p>They enjoy a legiſlative power, as the lords do in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; and exerciſe alſo judicial authority upon writs of error and appeals. They are convened by the governor; and he is always preſent when they ſit as a court or privy council, which is ordinarily at the fort. In their legiſlative capacity, they meet without the governor, and always at the city hall. They ſit according to their ſeniority, and the eldeſt member preſent is ſpeaker of their houſe. In a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, the chairman has no voice. They cannot vote by proxy, but have the privilege of entering their diſſent, and the reaſons at large, on their minutes. Their proceedings are very formal, and in many reſpects they imitate the example of the lords. Their meſſages to the aſſembly are carried by one of their own members, and the houſe always riſes at his entrance and receives them ſtanding. The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil never publiſh their legiſlative minutes; but the aſſembly always print their own votes; nor do either of theſe houſes permit ſtrangers to be preſent at their conventions,</p>
               <p>A counſellor's title is, 'the honourable.' They ſerve his majeſty without ſalaries. The buſineſs of the privy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:024800_0253_0FCD64629AC7A2F8"/>board is of late very much increaſed, and never had ſo great weight in the colony as at preſent, which is much owing to the king's calling lawyers of reputation to the aſſiſtance of his governors. The preſent members are the honourable</p>

<pb n="259" facs="unknown:024800_0254_0FCD64663465C5C8"/>ſpeech to both houſes; and, at the requeſt of the ſpeaker, delivers a copy for the uſe of the aſſembly.</p>
               <p>I need not enlarge upon the cuſtoms of the general aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, for they take the practice of the Britiſh houſe of commons for their model, and vary from them in but very few inſtances. Money bills are not returned to them by the council board, as the lords do to the commons; and yet the reaſons for this practice are much ſtronger here than at home. When the governor paſſes the bills ſent up to him, both houſes are preſent in the council chamber. It is then cuſtomary for him to aſk the advice of his council with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to every bill, and he ſigns them at the foot after theſe words, "I aſſent to this bill, enacting the ſame, and order it to be enrolled." After that the acts are publiſhed in the open-ſtreet near the city hall; his excellency and the two houſes being preſent.</p>

               <p>The continuance of our aſſemblies was unlimited, till the political ſtruggles, which took riſe in mr. Coſby's adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, forced mr. Clarke, who ſucceeded him, to paſs the act reſtricting them to three years: but this was repealed by the king, and a ſeptennial law enacted ſoon after the arrival of governor Clinton, which is ſtill in full force.</p>
               <p>No colony, upon the continent, has formerly ſuffered more than ours, in the opinion of the king's miniſters. This has been owing to the ill impreſſions made by our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, who are ſcarce ever diſengaged from diſputes with the lower houſe. Our repreſentatives, agreeable to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſenſe of their conſtituents, are tenacious in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the inhabitants of this colony are entitled to all the privileges of Engliſhmen; that they have a right to participate in the legiſlative power; and that the ſeſſion of aſſemblies here, is wiſely ſubſtituted inſtead of a repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in parliament, which, all things conſidered, would, at this remote diſtance, be extremely inconvenient and dangerous. The governors, on the other hand, in general, entertain political ſentiments of a quite different nature. All the immunities we enjoy, according to them, not only flow from, but abſolutely depend upon, the mere grace and will of the crown<note n="*" place="bottom">"We are no more than a little corporation.—I would adviſe theſe gentlemen (aſſemblies) for the future, to drop thoſe parliamentary airs and ſtyle about liberty and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and keep within their ſphere, and make the beſt uſe they can of his majeſty's inſtructions and commiſſion; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it would be high treaſon to ſit and act without it.—This is our charter. If we abuſe or make a wicked uſe of his majeſty's favours, we are, of them, but tenants at will; we only hold them, during pleaſure and good behaviour." Theſe are the accurate and bright thoughts of the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who publiſhed a pamphlet, entitled "an eſſay on the government of the colonies," in 1752. Sir William Jones, attorney general to James II. was of a very different opinion. For he told the king, "that he could no more grant a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to levy money on his ſubjects in the plantations, without their conſent by an aſſembly, than they could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge themſelves from their allegiance." Life of ſir William Phips. p. 23.</note>. It is eaſy to conceive, that contentions
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:024800_0256_0FCD64691D307150"/>muſt naturally attend ſuch a contradiction of ſentiments. Moſt of our diſputes however relate to the ſupport of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Before lord Cornbury's embezzlements, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue was eſtabliſhed for a long period, but afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a few years. The violent meaſures, in mr. Coſby's time, led the aſſembly to the ſcheme of an annual proviſion. Theſe are the words of that much famed addreſs of the houſe, to lieutenant governor Clarke, on the 8th of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1737, previous to the change.</p>
               <p>"The true cauſes of the deficiency of the revenue, we believe, are too well known to your honour, to make it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for us to ſay much on that head. Had the conſpicuous loyalty of the inhabitants of this province, met with a ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble treatment in return, it is not unlikely, but we ſhould now be weak enough to act like others before us, in being laviſh beyond our abilities, and raiſing ſums unneceſſary to be given; and continued the donation, like them, for a longer time than what was convenient for the ſafety of the inhabitants: but experience has ſhown the imprudence of ſuch a conduct; and the miſerable condition, to which the province is reduced, renders the raiſing of large ſums very difficult, if not impracticable. We therefore beg leave to be plain with your honour, and hope you will not take it amiſs, when we tell you, that you are not to expect, that we either will raiſe ſums unfit to be raiſed; or put what we ſhall raiſe into the power of a governor to miſapply, if we can prevent it: nor ſhall we make up any other deficiencies, than what we conceive are fit and juſt to be paid; or continue what ſupport or revenue we ſhall raiſe, for any longer time than one year. Nor do we think it convenient to do even that, until ſuch laws are paſſed, as we conceive neceſſary for the ſafety of the inhabitants of this colony, who have repoſed a truſt in us for that only purpoſe; and which we are ſure you will think it reaſonable we ſhould act agreeable to; and by the grace of God we will endeavour not to deceive them."</p>

                  <pb n="262" facs="unknown:024800_0257_0FCD646A9BC05308"/>
The ſentiments of this addreſs ſtill prevail among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and therefore the ſucceſs of the preſent ſolicitations, for a permanent, indefinite ſupport, will probably be in vain.</p>
               <p>The matter has been often litigated with great fervency on both ſides, and the example of the Britiſh parliament urged as a precedent for our imitation. To this it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that the particular ſtate of this province differs ſo widely from that of their mother country, that we ought not in this reſpect to follow the cuſtom of the commons. Our conſtitution, as ſome obſerve, is ſo imperfect in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs inſtances, that the rights of the people lie, even now, at the mere mercy of their governors; and granting a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual ſupport, it is thought, would be in reality little leſs, than the loſs of every thing dear to them.</p>
               <p>It muſt be confeſſed, that many plauſible arguments may be aſſigned, in ſupport of the jealouſy of the houſe. A go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor has numberleſs opportunities, not proper to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, for invading the rights of the people; and inſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able difficulties would neceſſarily attend all the means of redreſs.</p>
               <p>By gradual advances, at ſeaſonable junctures, we might have introduced ſuch amendments, as would, at this day, have eſtabliſhed a ſound and well fortified political frame; but through our utter neglect of education, the ancient aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies conſiſted of plain, illiterate huſbandmen, whoſe views ſeldom extended farther than to the regulation of highways, the deſtruction of wolves, wild cats, and foxes, and the advancement of the other little intereſts of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular counties, which they were choſen to repreſent.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of our laws and courts.</head>
               <p>THE ſtate of our laws opens a door to much controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy. The uncertainty, with reſpect to them, renders property precarious, and greatly expoſes us to the arbitrary deciſions of bad judges. The common law of England is generally received, together with ſuch ſtatutes, as were enacted before we had a legiſlature of our own. But our courts exerciſe a ſovereign authority, in determining what
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:024800_0258_0FCD646C1AEB24D0"/>parts of the common and ſtatute law ought to be extended; for it muſt be admitted, that the difference of circumſtances neceſſarily requires us, in ſome caſes, to reject the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of both. In many inſtances, they have alſo extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as I have elſewhere obſerved, even acts of parliament, paſſed ſince we have had a diſtinct legiſlation, which is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding greatly to our confuſion. The practice of our courts is not leſs uncertain than the law. Some of the Engliſh rules are adopted and others rejected. Two things, therefore, ſeem to be abſolutely neceſſary for the public ſecurity.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The paſſing an act for ſettling the extent of the Engliſh laws. And,</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the courts ordain a general ſet of rules for the regulation of the practice.</p>
               <p>To give a particular account of our laws, civil and crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, cannot be expected in this work. All lands are held of the crown by ſocage tenure, as thoſe of Eaſt-Greenwich, at home, in the county of Kent; and the manner of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a title to ſuch as are vacant, or in the poſſeſſion of the Indians, is this:</p>
               <p>Formerly the cuſtom was to apply to the governor in council, for a licenſe to purchaſe lands of the natives in his majeſty's name. A deed was then privately obtained from the Indian proprietors to the king, and annexed to a ſecond petition to the governor, for a warrant to the ſurveyor-ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, to make a ſurvey of the quantity purchaſed. Another warrant, upon the return of the ſurvey, was then iſſued to the attorney-general, to prepare a draught of the patent; which being tranſmitted to the ſecretary's office, was then engroſſed upon parchment, and the great ſeal affixed to it by the governor.</p>
               <p>In theſe ſurveys and deeds, more lands were often inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, than the Indians intended to ſell; and theſe frauds being frequently complained of, an order was made by the governor and council in 1736, that thenceforth no Indian deed ſhould be taken, until the land propoſed to be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was actually ſurveyed by the ſurveyor-general, or one of his deputies, in the preſence of the Indian proprietors; that the bounds of the tract ſhould be then entered in the deed, and a certificate endorſed, that they are agreeable to the ſurvey, and that he ſaw the conſideration money or goods, <hi>bonâ fide,</hi> delivered to the vendors.</p>
               <p>The patenting of lands, has long been, and ſtill continues to be, very expenſive.</p>
               <p>Our law judicatories are numerous; I begin with the loweſt.</p>

                  <p>JUSTICES of the peace are appointed by commiſſion from the governors, who, to ſerve their purpoſes in elections, ſometimes grant, as it is called, the adminiſtration to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular favourites in each county, which is the nomination of officers civil and military; and by theſe means, the juſtices have been aſtoniſhingly multiplied. There are inſtances of ſome who can neither write nor read<note n="*" place="bottom">Lord Bacon's obſervation, that there are many who count it a credit to be burdened with the office of a juſtice of the peace, is very applicable to us. Bacon's works, fol. vol. II. p. 151.—The ſtatute of 38 Hen. VIII. limited the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of juſtices to eight in a county.</note>. Theſe genii, beſides their ordinary powers, are by acts of aſſembly enabled to hold courts, for the determination of ſmall cauſes of five pounds and under; but the parties are pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileged, if they chooſe it, with a jury of ſix men. The proceedings are in a ſummary way, and the conduct of the juſtices has given juſt cauſe to innumerable complaints. The juſtices have alſo a juriſdiction, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to crimes under the degree of grand larceny. For any three of them (one being of the quorum) may try the criminal, without a jury, and inflict puniſhments not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to life or limb.</p>

                  <p>THE court of common-pleas takes cognizance of all cauſes, where the matter in demand is in value above five pounds. It is eſtabliſhed by an ordinance of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor in council. The judges are ordinarily three, and hold their offices during pleaſure. Through the infancy of the country, few, if any of them, are acquainted with the law. The practice of theſe courts is ſimilar to that of the common-bench, at Weſtminſter. They have each a clerk commiſſioned by the governor, who iſſues their writs, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters their minutes, and keeps the records of the county. They are held twice every year.

                  <p>THE juriſdiction of this court extends through the whole province; and its powers are very great. For it takes cognizance of all cauſes, civil and criminal, as fully as the king's bench and common pleas, at Weſtminſter. In civil controverſies, the value of the ſum demanded muſt exceed twenty pounds. This court has four terms in a year, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſits at New York<note n="*" place="bottom">The terms commence on the third Tueſdays in January, April, and October, and on the laſt in July. The firſt and the laſt continue five days, and the two other terms ten.</note>. The judges, for many years paſt, have been but three. The chief juſtice has ten ſhillings as a perquiſite, upon the firſt motion in every cauſe, together with an annual allowance of three hundred pounds. The ſecond and third juſtices have alſo yearly appointments, too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable to be worth mentioning.

                  </p>
                  <p>The ſupreme court was, at firſt, eſtabliſhed by ſeveral laws of the province; but the terms were, afterwards, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by an ordinance of the governor and council, which is alterable at pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>Whether this court has a right to determine cauſes in a courſe of equity, was a queſtion much ligitated during the troubles, in the ſeveral adminiſtrations of mr. Coſby and mr.

Murray, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered their opinions at their requeſt, both which were afterwards printed by their order. The former, who ſpoke firſt, urged numerous authorities, to prove that no court of equity could be legally eſtabliſhed except by preſcription or an act of the legiſlature, and concluded with theſe words—"'Tis with the greateſt ſubmiſſion that I tender my opinion upon theſe points. I have ſaid nothing with a deſign to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend any man, nor have I omitted ſaying any thing, that I thought might tend to the public good. <hi>Liberavi animam meam.</hi> I have endeavoured to diſcharge the truſt, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the character, with which this houſe has honoured me.

I have no intereſt in the points in queſtion, but what are common to all the freemen of this province. I profeſs the greateſt veneration for the laws of my country, and am glad of every opportunity to do them public honour. They place our liberties upon the firmeſt baſis, and put our properties under the ſureſt protection. I rejoice in the ſecurity that we have of a long enjoyment of them, by the ſettlement of the ſucceſſion in the houſe of Hanover. 'Tis the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of our conſtitution, and the glory of our princes, that they are ſovereign over freemen and not ſlaves. 'Tis the miſery of an arbitrary government, that a man can enjoy nothing under it that he can call his own. Life, liberty, and property, are not his, but all at the will and diſpoſal of his tyrannical owner. I don't wonder that our anceſtors have been always ſo jealous of their liberties: how oft have they bravely fought, and nobly died, in the defence of them? We have received our liberties and our laws, as an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance tranſmitted to us in the blood of our fathers. How highly, therefore, ſhould we prize and value them! And what care ſhould we take, that we and our poſterity may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy them in their full extent? If this be our happy caſe, <hi>we ſhall ſit under our own vines and our own fig-trees, and none will make us afraid.</hi> We ſhall ſee our country flouriſh, and ourſelves a happy people. But if an arbitrary power over our liberties and properties be let in upon us, but at a back door, it will certainly drive many of us out of our habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and 'tis to be feared, will once more reduce our
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:024800_0262_0FCD64761C614DF8"/>country to a wilderneſs, and a land without inhabitant: which we doubt not but this honourable houſe will take care to prevent."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Murray laboured to ſhow, that the chancery, king's bench, common pleas and exchequer, were of original juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, by the conſtitution of England; and was fearful that our eſtabliſhment of theſe courts here, by an act of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, would draw into queſtion our equal rights to all the liberties and privileges of Engliſhmen. He cloſed his opinion in this manner:</p>
                  <p>"And now, mr. ſpeaker, I have in the beſt manner that I was capable of, performed what this honourable houſe deſired of me, in giving truly my ſentiments upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject matter of theſe petitions.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Smith, in delivering his ſentiments laſt Friday, did in ſo handſome and elegant a manner, fully prove that the people of this colony are undoubtedly entitled to the cuſtoms, laws, liberties, and privileges of Engliſhment, that it was needleſs for me to attempt the proof thereof, which otherwiſe I ſhould have done. But I do entirely agree with him, in all that he ſaid on that head; and I hope I have proved, that the fundamental courts, by the laws of England, are as much part of thoſe liberties and privileges, and as much by the cuſtoms and laws of England, as any other of their liberties and privileges are; and of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, the people here as much entitled to thoſe funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental courts, as to their other privileges; and have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to anſwer all the objections that I had heard were, or thought could be, made againſt our being entitled to the ſame courts. And upon the whole thereof, as there has been much talked about the liberties and privileges of the people, I would beg leave only to propound this one queſtion, who is he that argues moſt in favour of the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the people? He who affirms and proves, that they are entitled to thoſe liberties and privileges, laws and cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of England, and the good old original courts, that are by thoſe laws, without an act? or, he who argues and ſays, we are not entitled to them, until an act is paſſed to eſtabliſh them? I ſuppoſe the anſwer would be given, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heſitation, in favour of the former.</p>
                  <p>"But, mr. ſpeaker, if it yet ſhould be ſaid, that there is a neceſſity for making acts, relating to thoſe courts, I would beg leave to offer to this honourable houſe, the imitation of ſuch laws relating to thoſe courts, as the wiſe legiſlature of England have thought ſit to make. I preſume, it will not be ſaid, there can be a better pattern offered for the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:024800_0263_0FCD64774BA31488"/>to go by. And it is not to be ſuppoſed, but that the parliament at home has made all the regulations therein that can be thought neceſſary; whereas going into new ſchemes and new inventions, may be attended with many inconveniences, which, when they happen, may not be ſo eaſily remedied.</p>
                  <p>"And I beg leave to conclude, by praying that God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty may guide, direct, and influence this honourable houſe, in their debates and conſultations upon this momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous affair, and that the end thereof may be for the good of all the inhabitants of this colony."</p>
                  <p>The oppoſition, to the exchequer, became now ſtronger than before the council were heard.

                              <p>By your requeſt, I have peruſed and conſidered the arguments of mr. Smith and mr. Murray, before the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral aſſembly of New-York, in relation to the court of equity eſtabliſhed there in a new court of exchequer; which, I perceive, was done, principally, for determining a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute between the governor and the preſident of the council, about their right to the ſalary annexed to the office of the commander in chief, whether he be the governor or preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; and it ſeems ſtrange to me, that upon ſuch an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſo extraordinary a ſtep ſhould be taken, as the erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a new court, exempted from the rules of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding at the common law, when the matter might have been decided in an action of the caſe upon an <hi>indebitatus aſſumpſit,</hi> which is the ſettled method and moſt expeditious remedy, in caſes of that nature.</p>
                              <p>Both theſe gentlemen ſeem to have agreed in one point, that it was neceſſary to trace the court of chancery and the equity court in the exchequer back to their original inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, in order to ſhow whether the governor of a new plantation, hath a power or not, to erect courts, in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe high and ancient courts in England.—And from their reſearches, they ſeem to have made very different concluſions. Mr. Smith rightly concludes againſt the lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of this court; but mr. Murray is afraid all muſt be loſt, if the four fundamental courts, as he calls them, cannot be obtained in New York.—I own I do not underſtand the force of this ſort of reaſoning; nor can I conceive, how any enquiry into the original of the high court of chancery, which muſh, after all, end in a mere conjecture, can afford the leaſt aſſiſtance, in forming a right judgment upon this queſtion, which muſt depend upon the particular conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe foreign colonies.—</p>
                              <p>The court of chancery, in England, has its being from cuſtom and uſage, to which it owes its legality.—If it were to be erected now by the king's power, it could not ſtand; therefore it is undoubtedly a great abſurdity to ſuppoſe, that upon the planting every new colony by the ſubjects of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, new courts muſt ſpring up, as it were from the roots of the ancient courts, and be eſtabliſhed without the conſent of the legiſlature; becauſe we can imitate their methods of proceeding, though we are very imperfect in compariſon to their reaſon and Judgment.—Then I think there is another impropriety in the debate of this queſtion: they would ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue from the power and prerogative of the king, to entitle a governor to act in the ſame manner. I think, before they turn a governor into a king, they ſhould take care, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for him the ſame ſufficiency of wiſdom and as able a council: therefore I muſt ſuppoſe, a mighty difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the power of a king and the governors abroad.—Their inſtructions, as to the erecting of courts, or the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities granted in their patents for that purpoſe, are not now, as they were in the beginning, when there were no courts: but proper judicatures being long ſince eſtabliſhed, there is an end of their power in that reſpect; and if any alteration is found neceſſary, it muſt certainly be done by the conſent of the legiſlature. The kings of England have always, ſo far as I am acquainted with the hiſtory of the plantations, uſed a particular tenderneſs in the buſineſs of erecting their courts of judicature, by directing their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, to take the advice of the general aſſemblies in that matter, and I dare ſay, that if the patents and inſtructions of the governor of New-York were to be inſpected, no ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient warrant will be found in them, to exerciſe this high power of ſetting up new courts. But be that as it will, this is moſt manifeſt, that ſetting up one or more men, with power to judge men's properties, by other rules than thoſe of the common law, by which alone we of the plantations muſt be governed, muſt ſubject the eſtates of that people to an arbitrary rule, ſo far as they are reſtrained from appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to an higher juriſdiction, and may enſlave them to the weak, if not corrupt, judgments of thoſe men.—It really ſeems to be a ſingular misfortune to the people of New-York, that a queſtion of this nature ſhould be ſo far coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced, as to become a ſubject of argument, when, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, in any other colony, it would not have been thought a matter of any doubt or the leaſt difficulty. But above all, it is moſt extravagant, that a court of equity ſhould be erected, for the trial of a cauſe, of which, without doing violence to its nature, it cannot have any juriſdiction: and I have wondered, in ſo warm a debate, that this point has been paſſed over.—I think nothing could entitle the court of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to proceed in the cauſe between the governor and Van Dam, unleſs there was a want of proof, of Van Dam's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the money in diſpute, which I ſuppoſe is impoſſible, ſince it muſt have iſſued out of the public treaſury of the province.—If I had been to have argued this point, I ſhould have taken a very different method from thoſe gentlemen. Inſtead of taking ſo much pains, in running through ſo many book caſes, to ſettle what the conſtitution of England is, I would have ſtated the conſtitution of this particular government, as it is grounded either upon treaties or grants from the crown of England; for as New-York was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered country, it is very probable, ſomething may have been ſtipulated, between the ſtates general and crown of England, in behalf of the ſubjects of Holland, which were left there in poſſeſſion of their eſtates, and ſo became ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to England.—If there was any ſuch treaty, that muſt be looked upon as the fundamental law of the province; and next to that, the king's charters muſt take place.—I do not at all doubt, but ſome way or other, the common law was eſtabliſhed there, and if not, as there is a legiſlature, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it is adopted by the country; for there is undoubtedly, a great difference between the people of a conquered coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and colonies eſtabliſhed by the king's conſent by the ſubjects of England. The common law follows them where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they go; but as to the other, it muſt ariſe either from treaties or grants; therefore it is a pity, every thing in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to this matter has been omitted, which would have been of great uſe to thoſe, who are unacquainted with the facts, in forming a judgment in this caſe.—I cannot forbear obſerving a mighty weakneſs in the lawyers of New-York, in blindly following a common error, in relation to the ſtatutes of England being in force there; whereas there is no foundation in ſenſe or reaſon for ſuch an opinion. The common law muſt be the only rule; and if we wade into the ſtatutes, no man can tell what the law is. It is certain, all of them cannot bind, and to know which do, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways above my capacity.—Thoſe, that are declarative of the common law, ſerve us rather as evidences, than by any binding quality, as ſtatutes.</p>

                  <p>The door of admiſſion into the practice is too open. The uſual preparatories are a college or univerſity education, and three years apprenticeſhip, or, without the former, ſeven years ſervice under an attorney. In either of theſe caſes, the chief juſtice recommends the candidate to the governor, who thereupon grants a licenſe to practice under his hand and ſeal at arms. This being produced to the court, the uſual ſtate oaths and ſubſcription are taken, together with an oath for his upright demeanor, and he is then qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to practice in every court in the province. Into the county courts, attornies are introduced with ſtill leſs cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. For our governors have formerly licenſed all perſons, how indifferently ſoever recommended; and the profeſſion has been ſhamefully diſgraced, by the admiſſion of men not only of the meaneſt abilities, but of the loweſt employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

                  <p>OF all our courts, none has been more obnoxious to the people than this. There have been (as I have already ſhown) few adminiſtrations ſince its firſt erection, in which our aſſemblies have not expreſſed their diſapprobation of its conſtitution by ordinance, and the exerciſe of the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor's power by the governor. During the adminiſtration of governor Coſby, a bill was filed by ſir Joſeph Eyles and others, to vacate the oblong patent granted by his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate predeceſſor to Hauley and company. The defendants excepted to the governor's juriſdiction; but being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled, they reſorted to the aſſembly with a complaint, and the houſe, on the 6th of November 1735, reſolved,</p>
                  <p>"That a court of chancery in this province, in the hands or under the exerciſe of a governor, without conſent in general aſſembly, is contrary to law, unwarrantable, and of dangerous conſequence to the liberties and properties of the people."</p>
                  <p>The ſame ſentiments obtained among the people in mr. Clarke's time, as is very evident in the memorable addreſs of the aſſembly, in 1737, a part of which, relative to the court of chancery, is too ſingular to be ſuppreſſed.</p>
                  <p>"The ſettling and eſtabliſhing of courts of general juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, for the due adminiſtration of juſtice, is neceſſary in every country: and we conceive they ought to be ſettled and eſtabliſhed, by the acts of the whole legiſlature, and their ſeveral juriſdictions and powers by that authority limited and appointed, eſpecially courts that are to take cognizance of matters in a courſe of equity.—This has been the conſtant practice in England, when new courts were to be erected, or old ones to be aboliſhed or altered: and the ſeveral kings of England, in whoſe reigns thoſe acts were made, never conceived, that the ſettling, erecting, or abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing courts, by acts of the legiſlature, had any tendency to deſtroy or in the leaſt to diminiſh their juſt and legal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives.
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:024800_0270_0FCD64878BEDECB0"/>—It was the method in uſe here, both before and ſince the revolution, and particularly recommended to the aſſembly to be done in that manner, by a meſſage from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor Sloughter and council, on the 15th day of April 1691. He was the firſt governor ſince the revolution; and the governors that ſince that time aſſented to thoſe acts, we ſuppoſe, never in the leaſt imagined, they were giving up the prerogative of their maſters, when they gave that aſſent; nor did we ever learn, that they were cenſured for doing ſo.—On the contrary, the conſtant inſtructions, that have from time to time been given to the governors of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, ſeem clearly to point out the doing of it, by acts of the legiſlature, and not otherwiſe, as may be gathered from the inſtruction, for the erecting of a court for the determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſmall cauſes, by which there are poſitive directions given to the governors, to recommend it to the aſſembly, that a law ſhould be paſſed for that purpoſe; but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe directions, given in direct and expreſs terms, the governors never would apply for ſuch an act, but erected that court by an ordinance of themſelves and council, as they did the court of chancery, which had before that time been erected by acts of the legiſlature in another manner.—They could not be ignorant, what diſſatisfaction the erecting of a court of chancery in that manner, gave the generality of the people.—This was very manifeſt, by the reſolves of the general aſſembly, at the time of its firſt being ſo erected, and often ſince, declaring the illegality of ſuch a proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And though theſe reſolves have been as often as made, treated by the governors with an unreaſonable diſregard and contempt of them, yet to men of prudence, they might have been effectual, to have made them decline perſiſting in a procedure, ſo illegal and ſo generally diſſatisfactory; and which (as they managed it) proved of no uſe to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic or benefit to themſelves. For as few of them had talents equal to the taſk of a chancellor, which they had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to perform, ſo it was executed accordingly. Some of them being willing to hold ſuch a court, others not, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they happened to be influenced by thoſe about them. So that were it really eſtabliſhed in the moſt legal manner (as it was not) yet being in the hands of a perſon not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellable to do his duty, it was ſo managed, that the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary delays and fruitleſs expenſe attending it, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it not only uſeleſs, but a grievance to the inhabitants, eſpecially thoſe, who were ſo unfortunate as to be concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it: which we hope you think with us, that it is high time ſhould be redreſſed.</p>

"Your honour well knows, that the eſtabliſhing that court, in the manner it has been done, has been a ſubject of contention, between the governors and the aſſembly; and ſince it is confeſſed by all, that the eſtabliſhing both of that, and other courts, by act of the legiſlature, is indiſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably legal, and gives them the moſt uncontrovertible au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and if unqueſtionably legal, what is ſo, cannot be deſtructive of his majeſty's prerogative.—We therefore hope, you will make no ſcruple of aſſenting to this bill, to put an end to a contention, that has not been, nor will be, while it continues, beneficial to his majeſty's ſervice."—</p>
                  <p>From this time, the chancery has been unattacked by the aſſembly, but the buſineſs tranſacted in it is very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable. A court of equity is abſolutely neceſſary, for the due adminiſtration of juſtice; but whether private proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ought to be in the hands of the governors, I leave others to determine<note n="*" place="bottom">Some are of opinion, that the governor's juriſdiction in this, and the ſpiritual, or prerogative court, are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible.</note>. As the public buſineſs of the colony increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, few of them, I believe, will be ambitious of the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor's office, as they have not the aſſiſtance of a maſter of the rolls. The preſent officers of this court (which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways held in the council chamber at the fort) are, his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency ſir Charles Hardy, knt. chancellor, two maſters, two clerks, one examiner, a regiſter, and a ſerjeant at arms, and not one of them has a ſalary. In our proceedings, we copy after the chancery in England; and indeed in all our courts, the practice at home is more nearly imitated in this and New Jerſey, than in any other province upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent. Few of our aſſemblies have been capable to concert any new regulations of this kind: and hence the lawyers have had recourſe to the Engliſh cuſtoms and forms, which they have generally adopted. While the New England colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, through the ſuperior education of their repreſentatives, have introduced numberleſs innovations, peculiar to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; the laws of our mother country have gradually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained here, and in this reſpect, the public has perhaps receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed advantages, even from the ignorance of our anceſtors.</p>
