            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>AND THEY SPAKE OF JOSIAH IN THEIR LAMENTATIONS TO THIS DAY, AND MADE THEM AN ORDINANCE IN ISRAEL.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>WE cannot wonder that the people of Iſrael were thus deeply affected by the death of a good prince who was their warm friend and their great benefactor. JOSIAH was the common centre around which every good citizen of Judah revolved; and on him they relied, under GOD, to defend their country if invaded from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and to cruſh, with the weight of his name and virtues, faction and rebellion at home.</p>
            <p>HOW melancholy is the reflection that in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal dominion of death over the human race, men of the moſt ſublime virtues and moſt illuſtrious tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, are not only ſubjected to it, but frequently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the more early victims of his power; while ſome others who cumber the ground, and infeſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, ſtill live to diſturb and diſtreſs all around them! We cannot comprehend the deſigns of Providence! It becomes us only to ſubmit and to adore, to bow
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:038618_0005_1012A830417BC6A8"/>
before the throne of the higheſt, encircled as it may be with the thickeſt clouds, and to know that "the Judge of all the earth will do right."</p>
            <p>ALAS! that the empire of death is ſo univerſal; that the wiſe and the prudent, the brave and the virtuous, muſt ſubmit to its power, as well as "the fool and the brutiſh perſon." It is indeed "ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed unto all men once to die, and there is no diſcharge in that war."</p>
            <p>WHEN the power of the king of terrors is exerciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over thoſe who, like JOSIAH, were highly eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and fondly beloved; when it levels, with its fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal wand, the men who ſtood high above their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low mortals, and removes to their long home thoſe whoſe ſervices and ſufferings had purchaſed the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and happineſs of a nation, we cannot be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed that uncommon grief ſhould poſſeſs the heart, and uncommon tokens of mourning ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played!</p>
            <p>THE people of Judah, not content with ſimply committing their hero to the tomb, and bedewing his hearſe with the tears which a recent loſs occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, reſolved to manifeſt their grief by long and uncommon mourning. All Judah and Jeruſalem, we are told, mourned for JOSIAH. They attended his remains to the ſepulchre of his fathers, with deep and ſolemn grief. But they did not ceaſe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of it, when the clods of the valley covered him, and the grave concealed him from their view. But, "led by JEREMIAH, the prophet of the LORD, they lamented for JOSIAH." Determined to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate their gratitude, "the ſinging men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:038618_0006_1012A83786728728"/>
(the poets and hiſtorians of that age) ſpake of JOSIAH in their lamentations to the very day" in which the chronicles were written. This was many years after the death of JOSIAH; probably after the return of the Jews from the Babyloniſh captivity, when the ſacred canon was completed, under the auſpices of heaven, by EZRA the high prieſt of the LORD.</p>
            <p>WHEN we loſe thoſe who are peculiarly dear to us, and thoſe whom we highly honor, we cannot endure the idea of their being forgotten. We determine that they ſhall live in our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and that their names ſhall be tranſmitted with honor and reſpect to the "generations which are yet to be born." It is a ſentiment ſimilar to theſe which led our civil fathers to inſtitute the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ſolemnities in which we are now engaged. Some weeks have elapſed ſince we were deprived of the great and good man who was ſo long the pride and the father of his country. Every thing which gratitude could dictate, affection inſpire and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence expreſs has already been ſaid and done on this occaſion. The ſervice before me is therefore a difficult one.</p>
            <p>BUT, this ſolemnity is of a religious nature. The humble worſhip of the Deity is our object, and a moral improvement of a death ſo affecting, our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in the exerciſe before us. My duty is not that of the eulogiſts, whoſe claſſic elegance and glowing deſcription have drawn the character of the illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous dead, and richly emblazoned his fame. No; it belongs to the preſent diſcourſe to lead our thoughts
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:038618_0007_1012A83A638206E0"/>
from earth to heaven; to adore the divine ſover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eignty; to acknowledge his gracious hand in all that the departed was himſelf and did for us; and to point out the leſſons of wiſdom, civil and religious, which we may learn from the affecting event!</p>
            <p>THE ſovereignty of GOD, like the thunders and lightnings and thick cloud which ſurrounded him on Mount Sinai, veils from our eyes many of the motives which influence the divine conduct, and oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in the government of the world. Without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul or reſtraint he does his pleaſure in heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove and on earth beneath. GOD is abſolute and unlimited in his will and purpoſes. Himſelf the firſt cauſe, the ſource, the fountain of all exiſtence and energy, he has communicated to his creatures whatever they poſſeſs, and the higheſt archangel in heaven is as entirely ſubjected to the divine ſover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eignty as the meaneſt reptile on earth. "GOD is a rock, and his work is perfect." The plan of his government is fixed beyond alteration, and all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are in his hands as the "clay is in the hands of the potter."</p>
            <p>THE divine ſovereignty would be a doctrine of terror and diſtreſs to us, did we not know that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided in a being perfectly wiſe and eſſentially good. It is not the exerciſe of power, prompted by caprice, actuated by reſentment, or dictated by folly. It is the reſult of infinite wiſdom which beholds the paſt, the preſent and the future at one view, which knows the nature and the conſequences of all events, and will bring them to paſs in the time and by the means which are moſt honorary to him, and moſt benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:038618_0008_1012A83D56D31FD8"/>
to his creatures. Viewed in this light, the ſov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ereignty of GOD ſhould calm our hearts, engage our truſt, command our obedience, and elevate our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. With the inhabitants of heaven we ſhould in humble devotion and grateful rapture, exclaim, "Alleluia, the LORD GOD omnipotent reigneth!"</p>
            <p>IN all the circumſtances which relate to the world and to man, from the revolution of a kingdom to the lighting of a ſparrow, we view and ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this ſovereign providence of the moſt HIGH. "In him we live and move and have our being." We are ſupported by his bounty, defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his power, pardoned by his grace, and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by his ſpirit. Surrounded by his immenſity, we are always before his eyes. He upholds us in life. His "viſitation preſerves our ſpirits," and he has determined the bounds of our habitations which we cannot paſs."</p>
            <p>DEATH is an intereſting period to us all, and for wiſe purpoſes we are made to dread its approaches. When its icy hand is laid upon us, or when its fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal vortex ſwallows up thoſe who are dear to us as ourſelves, then we ſhould realiſe the ſovereignty of GOD. "Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? there is no man who hath power over the ſpirit to retain the ſpirit in the day of death." When the decree goes forth from the eternal throne, when the "time, the ſet time" is come, then the grim tyrant performs his fatal office. The prayers and tears of an aſſembled nation; the fondeſt affection of imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate friends; the moſt brilliant virtues; the moſt illuſtrious character; the eſteem and honor and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:038618_0009_1012A83F34BFF7A0"/>
veneration of a world cannot for a moment arreſt the progreſs or prevent the approach of death! The great and the ſmall; the high and the low, the rich and the poor, bow their heads and die!</p>
            <p>BUT under the exerciſe of this act of ſovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, at a day of lamentation like the preſent, let us contemplate the wiſdom and goodneſs and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of GOD. "He is in heaven and we are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, and therefore it becomes us that our words ſhould be few." Our underſtandings, darkened by ſin and clogged with mortality, are ſometimes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed with the ways of GOD. But ſubmiſſion to his will becomes us who "are of yeſterday, and know nothing." We are as certain as he exiſts that GOD cannot do wrong. When therefore we mourn a loſs like that which now covers America with ſadneſs, we are to ſubmit without a murmer to thoſe diſpenſations which we cannot comprehend, and keep "our hearts fixed, truſting in the LORD."</p>
            <p>BUT when, in our lamentations, we ſpeak of the friends, the patrons whom we have loſt, we cannot fail to recollect their amiable characters and their excellent virtues.</p>
            <p>LET us conſtantly remember that GOD is the ſource of all virtue and of all excellency; that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals are good in themſelves and uſeful to us as he makes them to be ſo. We may meditate with pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure on their virtues. We may remember them with the warmeſt eſteem and tendereſt affection; but we ſhould never be unmindful, that every talent of nature, of reaſon and of art, deſcends from him who is "the father of our ſpirits, the former of our bodies, and the author of all our mercies."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:038618_0010_1012A844D3E2F528"/>WE mourn this day "a prince and a great man fallen in our Iſrael;" a man more truly elevated in the eſteem of the world than any monarch who wields a ſceptre, or any hero who commands an army! The people of America have borne witneſs to his numerous virtues; and now, we will ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon his illuſtrious ſhade to aid us in ſupport of the religion which he honored, and to make thoſe men virtuous and good whom he was inſtrumental of making free and happy.</p>
            <p>Too often the public virtues of a great character are clouded by private views. Sometimes thoſe who are moſt uſeful to the world, and whoſe ſolid ſervices and brilliant talents, compel our reſpect and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, prove themſelves in the more retired walks of life to be "weak like other men." It is happy for America, now ſhe mourns her darling ſon, that not even the envenomed tongue of malice, battening on the faults of its neighbours, nor the rageful voice of party, more cruel than the grave itſelf, can aſſail the fair fame of the man whom ſhe laments! In the domeſtic relations; in his private dealings; in his daily department, you always beheld him diſcreet, amiable, dignified! He ſhone, not with the luſtre which dazzles courts and armies, but with the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, the more honorable rays of private virtue.</p>
            <p>WAS it not a ſenſe of religion which led our late excellent friend to acknowledge, when at the head of our armies, and more lately when he preſided in the nation, our abſolute dependence upon the GOD of providence, aſcribing the honor of his victories and our deliverance to him who "ſetteth up one
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:038618_0011_1012A84663E56848"/>
and putteth down another!" In his public inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; in his laſt precious legacy to his country, and in his private converſation he expreſſed the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reverence for the infinite and eternal being who is "in all and over all, and by whom all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt." His conſtant attendance on the chriſtian church, his reverend obſervation of the LORD's Day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as well as his whole behaviour, demonſtrated his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in the religion of the Croſs.</p>
            <p>"HE that is ſlow to anger is better than the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and he that ruleth his ſpirit than he that taketh a city." Never does a man appear ſo truly great as when he ſubdues thoſe paſſions which infuriate others, and hurry them to the moſt fatal exceſſes. And here our beloved chief diſcovered true great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and placed before our eyes an illuſtrious exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. His mildneſs, his patience, his impartial be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity enabled him to controul the paſſions of oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and reconcile contending intereſts. His ſelf command enabled him to rule thoſe who did not poſſeſs their own minds. A reſerve, partly the gift of nature and partly the effect of prudent habit, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented him from betraying his own purpoſes, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing ſudden and unſuitable feelings. His pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient endurance of wrong from the envious and the miſtaken, made him their ſuperior, and converted his enemies into friends. The enemies of his country I mean; perſonal enemies he had none.</p>
            <p>"HE that walketh uprightly, walketh ſurely." The bleſſing of GOD, the favor of men, and the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of a good conſcience are the conſequences of an honeſt and faithful diſcharge of our duty. Theſe
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:038618_0012_1012A847F5620BD0"/>
conſequences of his integrity did our late excellent Preſident enjoy. Neither wealth nor flattery nor clamour nor violence could corrupt his heart, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach him from his duty. Honeſtly did he exert his whole power and influence to ſerve his country, nor can an inſtance be produced of his having neglected its concerns, or betrayed its intereſts.</p>
            <p>IT it is recorded of NAAMAN that "by him GOD gave deliverance to Syria." And him whom we mention in our lamentations this day, GOD made the principal agent in giving freedom and deliverance to America. A ſoldier in early life, when he was high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſeful to his native province, he poſſeſſed a cool judgment and a determined courage. Without the ardent impetuoſity, the furious valour which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times give ſucceſs to folly and proſperity to injuſtice, he was intrepidly brave. His love of liberty, his well known military talents, led the venerable band of patriots, who, at the commencement of the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, conducted our councils, to conſign to him the chief command of the American forces. Many of us remember this period, when at the hazard of his life and fortune, he firſt headed our feeble armies.— "Gallant mortal"—how did our ſouls love and honor him when firſt we beheld him on yonder plains flying to the relief of the oppreſſed, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the freedom of his country! How anxiouſly did we watch his footſteps through the dangers of our revolution, and how did our hearts warm with gratitude to heaven and to him, when we found that the ſoldier had not deſtroyed the citizen; that the luſt of power which led ſo many generals, the CAE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SARS
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:038618_0013_1012A84C8FA8F4F8"/>
of old and the CROMWELLS of later days, to deſtroy their country and advance themſelves, had no exiſtence in his noble boſom; but that he could cheerfully reſign his brilliant and flattering com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and ſeek the ſhades of private life!—Thither did he modeſtly retire from the applauſes of his country and the world, and ſhook from his venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble brow the laurels which oppreſſed him!</p>
            <p>TO ſuch a man it was ſelf denial to leave the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and the ſecurity of private life, and again to enter on the fatigues and hazards of elevated ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—But the call of his country General WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON never declined. The unanimous ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of his fellow citizens (an election without a parallel in the hiſtory of the world) ſelected him to adminiſter the free and excellent conſtitution of government which he had aſſiſted in forming. In the cabinet he ſhone equally as in the field. The intereſts of the Union and of the ſeveral States he guarded with the tendereſt care. Our foreign rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he conducted with a temperate firmneſs which defeated the deſigns of faction, cruſhed the efforts of rebellion, and prevented us from being fatally affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the convulſions which have ſhaken Europe to its centre, and agitated the whole world!</p>
            <p>LIKE JOSHUA, the brave leader of Iſrael to inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence and Canaan; like DAVID, the intrepid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of his country; our late illuſtrious chief when, with manly dignity and patriotic affection he retired from the chair of government, left a legacy the moſt valuable and important to his country. While we are governed by the moral and religious
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:038618_0014_1012A853676AE588"/>
principles, and preſerve the policy with reſpect to our internal and external affairs which he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends, we ſhall be free and happy. When we leave them to adopt other principles and maxims, we ſhall deſerve any conſequences which may take place.</p>
            <p>NO man's character is fully aſcertained till his death. And happy is he who dies as he has lived in the exerciſe of firmneſs of ſpirit and benevolence of heart. So died our beloved friend! Without the ſickneſs and long debility which ſometimes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede death; in the full exerciſe of reaſon, of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity and patriotiſm, he ſuddenly encountered the univerſal conqueror. He ſubmitted, for reſiſtance was vain!—But nobly, and like a hero he ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted!—Great in his laſt moments, with his own hands he cloſed his own eyes, and gave up the Ghoſt!!—Happy man! Uſeful and beloved in life, calm and compoſed in death, embalmed with the tears of thy friends and thy country, GOD <hi>did</hi> bleſs thee above other mortals!</p>
            <p>AND now, let us make a ſolemn pauſe in our lamentations, and amidſt our grief acknowledge the goodneſs of GOD in raiſing up this great man, in qualifying him ſo eſſentially for the ſervice of his country, and continuing him to us for ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years. On this day, when we uſed to celebrate his birth with warm and grateful pleaſure, we feel his loſs moſt deeply. But, how much more deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhould we have felt it, had he been taken from us at any period of our revolutionary war; or when the whole weight of his influence and charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:038618_0015_1012A854F5E3AB68"/>
was neceſſary to preſerve us from being involved in the confuſions of the European world, or when inſurrection reared its hydra head, and threatened the moſt fatal conſequences?</p>
            <p>BUT that GOD who has always been kind to America in raiſing up from among her own ſons thoſe who "naturally care for her ſtate" and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully guard her intereſts, continued his life till a period when our excellent conſtitution is firmly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and the proſpects of diſuniting and deſtroying us are greatly weakened. While we mention WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON in our lamentations this day, let us be thankful that ſo many great and good men in our Federal and State Governments are ſtill ſpared to us; men whom GOD has qualified for eminent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and called to fill the moſt important ſtations. Let us be thankful for the ineſtimable life, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted integrity, the ſuperior wiſdom, and the pure patriotiſm of ADAMS, the wiſe and the good, who now preſides over theſe ſtates! May the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty continue him for many years, to be the father of his country, and the friend of mankind!</p>
            <p>LET us be deeply humbled before GOD, this day, under the frowns of his providence in taking away men ſo great, ſo good, ſo uſeful as thoſe whom we have lately been called to deplore.</p>
            <p>WHEN GOD removed from his ancient Iſrael "the ſtay and the ſtaff, the mighty man and the man of war, the prudent and the ancient, the hona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable man and the counſellor," it was conſidered as a token of the divine diſpleaſure, and called not only for grief but humiliation. Great and good men
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:038618_0016_1012A857EE867DF0"/>
are inſtruments in the hands of GOD to effect his purpoſes. They accompliſh his will, and by them he does good to us. When they are taken away therefore, we ought to humble ourſelves in his ſight. When thoſe by whom GOD has been uſed to do good to us are removed by death, have we not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to fear that he means to deprive us of the good itſelf?</p>
            <p>GOD is, we truſt and hope, the guardian and friend of America, and his gracious favor is the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladium of our country. Its exiſtence and proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty do not depend upon any one man, or any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men, let them be ever ſo wiſe or good. "The LORD is our defence, and the holy one of Iſrael is our King." It is true that when we ſuſtain the loſs of ſuch men as a WASHINGTON and a SUM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NER, we are conſtrained to ſay, "Help LORD, for the godly man ceaſeth, the faithful fail from among the children of men." When thoſe who "ſeemed to be pillars" are removed, we feel the goodly fabric of our government ſhaken. But, "the reſidue of the ſpirit is with GOD." He gave us theſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent men. He continued them to us as long as he ſaw to be beſt. And now that he has taken them away, we will ſubmit to the will of Heaven, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on him who has never forſaken us nor our fathers.</p>
            <p>BUT ſurely when we mention the virtuous and the good in our lamentations, we ſhould be ſtimulated to emulate their virtues, and be ſtudious to follow their advices, founded on experience, wiſdom and love of their country.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:038618_0017_1012A8598BFDC360"/>IT is not to the parade of mourning, nor to the dictates of affectionate feeling only that we ſhould this day attend. We ought to be made wiſer and better by an event ſo affecting, and ſervices ſo ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emn as we are now performing. Our civil rulers have called us to celebrate the days of mourning for our beloved friend, in order to fix deeply in our minds a reverence for his character, and a reſpect to the principles which he practiſed himſelf, and in his dying legacy recommended to us. You, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, venerable fathers, who compoſe the executive and legiſlative powers of the Commonwealth: You who ſo lately ſolemnized the obſequies of our own beloved Chief Magiſtrate, will ſuitably meditate on the uncertainty of human life, and the vanity of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man greatneſs. You will feel the importance of faithfully diſcharging your whole duty, both public and private, ſo that you may be approved of GOD, and "accepted of the multitude of your brethren." Go ye and imitate the ſelf-command, the diſintereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, the cool wiſdom and warm patriotiſm of the man whom a nation this day laments. Go ye and ſerve GOD, and your generation according to his will!" Go ye, continue in your uprightneſs, and ſtill preſerve the uſefulneſs which gives us ſecurity and proſperity!—This is an awful and a ſolemn ſcene! Here the ſupreme executive power, and the high leg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſlative authority of the Commonwealth, aſſemble in religious worſhip, to acknowledge and adore the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor of the univerſe under one of the moſt diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing events in his providence, and to condole each other on this melancholy diſpenſation. All the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:038618_0018_1012A85F09BF6C20"/>
of the Commonwealth unite this day in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of their grief, and ſympathize with their ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil rulers on the great and univerſal bereavement! May our mourning be uſeful, and may we be "taught to profit by the things which we ſuffer."</p>
            <p>ON imbibing the principles recommended by our late illuſtrious chief, equally diſtant from tyranny and licentiouſneſs, depends the ſafety of our country. If we wiſh to be great among the nations abroad, and to be peaceful and happy at home, we muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve inviolably our union. We muſt guard againſt improper foreign connexions. We muſt maintain a ſpirit of mutual forbearance and good will, and muſt cultivate eſpecially thoſe principles of religion and morality which are the only ſolid cement of ſociety, and the only firm foundation of liberty. Where GOD is neglected; where the religion of CHRIST is denied; where men are governed not by reaſon or religion, but by party views and furious paſſions, there may be the <hi>name</hi> of liberty, but the <hi>thing</hi> never can exiſt. If we are careful to preſerve and to foſter the univerſities, the ſchools we now maintain: If we honor and reſpect the day and the ordinances of GOD: If we deſpiſe and neglect vice, and honor and ſupport virtue: If we embrace the doctrines, and ſubmit to the precepts of the Goſpel, we ſhall be a happy people, and tranſmit our civil and religious liberties, a fair and a large inheritance, to the lateſt poſterity.</p>
            <p>BUT while we ſympathize with a nation in their afflictions, let us not forget the private diſtreſſes which this ſolemn event has occaſioned. We mourn with
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:038618_0019_10122E40A4BA3CA8"/>
the deſolate widow, who is deprived of the "guide of her youth," the friend of her riper years, and the moſt valuable of her earthly bleſſings! Calmly and with compoſure may ſhe ſubmit to this afflictive event; and ſince her attachments to earth are diminiſhed, may ſhe prepare to join the "deſire of her eyes" in a better world! May his friends, his relatives, his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtics, while they mourn his loſs, imitate his virtues, and may none who bear his illuſtrious name, tarniſh its luſtre, or bring diſgrace upon it.</p>
            <p>AND now, friends and fellow-citizens, let us "ceaſe from man whoſe breath is in his noſtrils, for where is he to be accounted of!" If thoſe who are the delights of their country, and the veneration of the world: If men of the pureſt characters: If thoſe for whom prayers are continually aſcending, that they may be ſpared and bleſſed: If <hi>they</hi> are taken away: If <hi>they</hi> are laid low in the duſt, how ſhall <hi>we</hi> eſcape this common lot of humanity! If theſe cedars of Lebanon, "the height whereof reacheth up to heaven, and the ſight thereof unto the ends of the earth:" If <hi>they</hi> bow and break, what ſhall become of the "hyſſop which ſpringeth out of the wall!"—Surely we are haſtening to the ſilent tomb, "the houſe appointed for all living!" We ſhall ſoon follow the friends whom we deplore, the wiſe and the good, whom we honor, through "the dark valley of the ſhadow of death!"—Let it be therefore our moſt earneſt ſolicitude, to partake of the grace of the Goſpel, to do our whole duty, and promote the welfare and happineſs of our fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſo that when we fall aſleep, we may be
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:038618_0020_1012A86372649AB0"/>
"found of our judge in peace," and be "received into everlaſting habitations!"</p>
            <p>AND now unto him, who is "prince of the kings of the earth," "before whom" all nations are as the drop of the bucket, and the duſt of the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance," to the infinite, perfect, eternal mind, "the ſame yeſterday, to day, and forever," be glory and honor, dominion and power, both now and forever,</p>
