            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A DISCOURSE.</head>
            <p>IT is an obſervation of the wiſeſt of men, that <hi>"to every thing there is a ſeaſon, and a time to every purpoſe under heaven."</hi> Tho' every day and every hour comes charged with ſome impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant duty; yet wiſdom will diſcern, in that ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſucceſſion of affecting events, with which the life of man is diverſified, the ſpecial times and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, for accompliſhing the benevolent purpoſes of GOD, reſpecting his eternal felicity. Man, both in his individual and ſocial capacity, is the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of mutation and viciſſitude; and his ſtate here below, is ever more or leſs checkered with proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous and adverſe occurrences. The ſeaſons of rejoicing, and the ſeaſons of mourning are oft re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning, with their appropriate leſſons of moral inſtruction. Now he is ſurrounded with objects, and inſpired with ſenſations, of pleaſure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light;
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037028_0004_100C8A17349AF6F8"/>
his horizon is gilded with happifying proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects; and he is excited to give ſcope to the feelings of grateful, innocent, ſocial joy. But there is not leſs a time to be ſad, than a time to rejoice. Anon, the charm is diſſolved; the viſionary phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of momentary happineſs are fled; and the heart is arreſted, in the career of pleaſure, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to more intereſting ſcenes. The wandering and thoughtleſs mind is ſummoned, by the ſober, monitory voice of misfortune, to the more chaſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed engagements of moral diſcipline, ſelf-inſpection, and religious improvement. To this unexpected fatality of events—this affecting reverſe of condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, communities, like individuals, are ever ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. They too, have their times of depreſſion, as well as elevation—their ſeaſons of ſadneſs, as well as rejoicing: and moſt kindly does the great Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor contemplate, in <hi>their</hi> diſpenſation, ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent ends of his moral government.</p>
            <p>LET us then improve the preſent occaſion, in connection with that diſtreſſing event, in which it has taken birth, to the purpoſe of imbuing our minds with ſome ſalutary and uſeful inſtruction. It is an occaſion ſingular and novel, in the annals of our country, as it is intereſting to the preſent ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037028_0005_100C8A18C9F4FB10"/>
The death of a man like one of us, has whelmed our country in the gloom of mourning, A man, like Joſhua of old, has been raiſed up, from among his brethren, whoſe important ſervices, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminent virtues, and high excellence of character, have ſo endeared him with the hearts of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, that his death has cauſed every deſcription of perſons to unite in teſtimonials of deepeſt regret. The enthuſiaſm of ſorrow has, on this occaſion, been indulged; and the tears of America have flowed, in copious effuſion, over the tomb of her departed WASHINGTON. "From Georgia to Maine, and from the ſkirts of the ocean to the habitations of the wilderneſs," the accents of grief have dwelt on every tongue; the gloom of deſpondency has ſat on every brow. Eloquence has laviſhed all her ſtores, and put forth all her energies! Diſtricts and corporations have met together, with the badges of mourning and the inſignia of wo, to mingle their condolences, to recount his virtues, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate his achievements and to blazon his fame. But it is now time that the tide of grief— the enthuſiaſm of ſorrow, ſhould have ſubſided. It is now time that reaſon and the moral feelings ſhould reſume their wonted calm, diſpaſſionate tone. With a deſire therefore to meet the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037028_0006_100C8A1B16C091D8"/>
of our political fathers, in the appointment of this commemoration, let us turn our regards to ſuch obvious and intereſting truths, as the occaſion is calculated to ſuggeſt.</p>
            <p>IT ſuggeſts, in the firſt place, the real con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection of eminent ſuperlative worth, with honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fame. Before us, is preſented a ſignal evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, depraved and degenerate as the human kind are, of the power of merit and real goodneſs, to command eſteem, veneration and love. However brilliancy of talents may be envied and maligned; however temporary uſefulneſs, prompted by tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary good intention, may be miſconſtrued or neglected; yet uniform inflexible integrity, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable virtue, and perſevering diſintereſted benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, will meet approbation and be crowned with honor. It is the appropriate privilege of ſuch a character, to riſe above envy, malice and faction. On ſuch a character the claſhing of cabals will often reflect additional luſtre; the anathemas of diſappointed partizans will in due time, be changed to congratulatory praiſes; the labyrinth of error and miſrepreſentation, as he proceeds in the ſtrait courſe of benevolent exertion, will gradually un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravel; and when he finiſhes his part and makes
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037028_0007_100C8A1D52EB0868"/>
his exit, envy will die; and the full burſt of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe will break forth, to conſecrate his memory and perpetuate his fame.</p>
            <p>AGAIN we are led, on the preſent occaſion, to analyze the individual attributes of an illuſtrious character; and to conſider, in what its grandeur preciſely conſiſts. The virtues, which conſtitute greatneſs, conciliate love, and attract veneration, are fidelity and ſincerity, modeſty and moderation, conſiſtency and regularity, humanity and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Theſe virtues informed by wiſdom—in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired by diſintereſted philanthropy and undiſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled piety, form the excellence of that character, which Americans will ever delight to extol. Courage and cunning—intrepidity in the field, and penetration in the cabinet, are doubtleſs qualities, which he eminently poſſeſſed. But theſe features of his character, are only the rude prominences of that fair piece, which, with infinite profit, we may critically ſurvey.</p>
            <p>TO queſtion the heroiſm of him, who led our armies to victory and to glory, no one could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend. To deny the merit of profound ſagacity to him, who conducted our political bark, with ſo
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037028_0008_100C8A1EE61F8580"/>
much ſucceſs, thro' ſo many dangers, would be equally unjuſt. Yet the humane and benevolent virtues, inſpired by the nobleſt principles, actuated by the pureſt motives, and exerted with moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed fidelity, perſeverance and utility, are the traits, which have exalted him far above oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who may have ſurpaſſed him in the trade of ſlaughter. Introduced upon the public theatre, at an eventful and important criſis; placed in a ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, which offered ſcope to patriotic and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent exertion, and poſſeſſing an adventrous mind, and a generous diſintereſted heart, he, in every period and department of his public functions, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played the full luſtre of thoſe virtues abovemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. Incorruptible in his principles, indefatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in his duties, immoveable in his deſigns, and firm and ſteady to the truſt repoſed in him, he evinced and exemplified that conſtancy of virtue and purity of motive, from which nothing could tempt him to ſwerve.</p>
            <p>WE are not unconſcious, that the brighteſt human characters will ever be ſhaded with much imperfection. We are conſcious moreover, that the fictitious repreſentation of a <hi>faultleſs monſter,</hi> would be affrontive to reaſon, and diſguſting to an
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037028_0009_100C8A2122EB06A0"/>
enlightened hearer. But if indiſcriminate, undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed applauſe were due to any one man, we would cheerfully beſtow it on our departed bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, father and friend. Let me not be accuſed of caſting incenſe on the altar of an idol if I ſay, that he ſtands forth, the higheſt approximation, which ſtory exhibits, or the annals of our country affords, to that ſpecies of character, which philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy loves to portray, and the deſpots of the world, in vain, would aſſume. He has not preſented an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to the maxim, that <hi>modeſty</hi> is ever an appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of true greatneſs. His modeſt, unaſſuming diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and deportment, ſtrikingly appear, in all his official and popular addreſſes. The diffidence and ſelf diſtruſt with which he accepted appointments aſſigned him, could only be equalled by that hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble piety and modeſt affability, with which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the congratulations of ſucceſs, in the iſſue. To himſelf he arrogates nothing;—to that ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign providence, which governs the affairs of the world, he aſcribes every auſpicious event.</p>
            <p>THE benevolence of his heart conſpired with the faculties of his mind, to form a character ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially uſeful, not oſtentatiouſly great. Of his correctneſs, diſpatch and promptitude in buſineſs;
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037028_0010_100C8A23C51EF960"/>
his uniformity, decorum and conſiſtency in every ſphere of life; his moderation in proſperity, and firmneſs and fortitude under misfortune; his cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency to the vanquiſhed, compaſſion to the miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and humanity towards all men—of theſe things, the whole ſeries of his public labors are a legible and fair document. The love of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and the love of mankind, reigned pure in his ſoul, without any alloy of avarice or ambition. While his mercenary antagoniſt fattened on the ſpoils of his country, <hi>he</hi> made a noble ſacrifice of wealth as well as of eaſe and pleaſure, and ſerved his country without any emolument. That <hi>diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſtedneſs,</hi> which forms the diſcriminating line between a WASHINGTON, and the proud pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to unmerited fame, will be ſubject of eulogy ſo long as merit ſhall be revered. Poſterity, in retrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back the current of events, to the memorable epoch of our national birth, with admiration, will contemplate our political Salvator at the cloſing pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of his military toils and dangers—crowned with conqueſt, firm in the affections and confidence of his veteran ſoldiers—putting off his armor, reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back his power, and retiring to the ſituation of a private citizen. Nor will poſterity be uninfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, with what greatneſs he, at a ſubſequent pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037028_0011_100C8A2604AD24C0"/>
repelled the aſſaults of the demon of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. By a powerful tho' corrupt combination, importuned, to place himſelf at the head of his country, and aſſume the title and the powers of royalty, he declared his reſolution to expatriate himſelf, rather than do an act, which would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade him to a level with a Cromwell or a Ceſar— Proofs palpable and convincive of that pure, diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted philanthropy, which inſpired and actuated all his exertions! To this ſource, and not to a blind, miſguided, local attachment, we are to refer the many ſacrifices he made for the good of his country; the various expedients he adopted, to render himſelf uſeful; the various forms under which he took occaſion to exemplify goodneſs; that ardent activity which filled his days; and that univerſality of character under which we recognize him. Hence that conſiſtency, uniformity and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectneſs throughout; that harmony of principle with practice, of motive with duty, of private with public life, which can never be preſerved by the intereſted, the ſordid or the inſincere. And ſhall not that unexampled accumulation of honor and public eſteem, thus acquired, form a new bond of attachment with <hi>us,</hi> to the ſame principle and the ſame conduct? Are you charmed with the auguſt
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037028_0012_100C8A2793993640"/>
and lovely image of ſo much benevolence, ſo nobly exerted? If ſo, then cultivate the ſame divine ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it. Does thy boſom bound with honeſt ardor, to merit the praiſes which are beſtowed on this orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our country? Then emulate his virtues, and copy his example. Think not, that his merit and this conſequent renown, is the excluſive privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege even of the beſt man; for no man is privileg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch a monopoly. The qualities and the virtues, which have conſecrated his memory, we have ſeen, were ſuch as <hi>we</hi> may poſſeſs. Though we cannot all move in his elevated ſphere—be firſt in council and firſt in the field; yet it may be in the power of every one, to be ſecond to none in fidelity and ſincerity, honeſty and regularity, modeſty and humility, humanity and compaſſion.</p>
            <p>FINALLY, we have preſented in view a ſhining example, of the union of moral goodneſs with genuine piety; and of that ſtable baſis, which religion affords, of all that is excellent in human conduct. Too often have the pretenders to greatneſs been aſhamed of religion. Religion they have conſidered as fit only to awe the ſtupid and the vile. They have regarded it as a yoke, under which the wiſe, the mighty, and the noble of this
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037028_0013_100C8A2960FF1138"/>
world ought not to ſubmit their necks. But the man, to whoſe greatneſs we reluctantly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a parallel, was not ſo far exalted above himſelf, as to overlook the importance of vital pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. He reſpected it, as the bond of ſocial order and union, and the grand ſupport of the duties of men and citizens. He cheriſhed it, as the only anchor of ſafety, amidſt the changes and miſeries of this uncertain ſtate. And we have juſt reaſon to believe that in the laſt dire exigency of nature, he buoyed up his ſpirits with its divine conſolations. He had not become a proſelyte to that miſerable philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, which is blind to the clear evidence of divine revelation: he was not aſhamed of the goſpel of Chriſt. To the wiſe inſtitutes and ſacred rituals of chriſtianity, he paid the moſt ſcrupulous attention. He regarded with due deference, the holy ſabbath. And he was conſtant, on that day, in the worſhip of God, in his church.—But the pleaſure, with which I make mention of this laſt article, is mingled with a ſenſation of deep regret. Shall I believe myſelf ſtanding on chriſtian ground, that I ſhould exhibit this humble trait, as appreciating the worth of an illuſtrious character? When I reflect on the prevailing indifference to every thing ſacred, in this corner of our country, can hardly believe myſelf

ſurrounded, at this moment, with a ſufficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the friends of Jeſus, to ſhield me from oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy, ſhould I enlarge on this topic. Bluſh, O my fellow ſinner! Will you believe, that <hi>you</hi> have leſs reaſon to bow down before GOD, and to aſk his protection, than the greateſt and beſt of men?</p>
            <p>IN this ſober, monitory ſeaſon, we are loudly admoniſhed by the impreſſion of the occaſion, to look to our moral ſtate; to trace out our defections, lapſes and crimes, and form reſolutions of inſtant amendment. While ſighing under the preſſure of a moſt diſtreſſing public calamity, it becomes us with all humility, to review our moral character and conduct, as a people; diligently to ſearch out the plague of our own heart; and ſeriouſly to examine the cauſes, by which we are incurring the frown of an offended Deity. In this examination, ſhall we not deplore and lament that ſpeculative and practical infidelity, which too much character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izes the preſent generation,—that dereliction of ſound principle both moral and religious; that contemptuous neglect of the truths and ordinances of our holy religion; that decay of the ſocial and patriotic virtues; that deſtitution of benevolence; and that virulent, uncandid reciprocation of abuſe

and calumny, which has taken riſe and gained frequency, in our political controverſies? And now that we are ſurveying with conſternation, a moſt melancholy chaſm, in our ſyſtem of national defence; ſhall we not unitedly reſolve to renounce our corrupting and demoralizing habits; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert our combined endeavors, to check that nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al degeneracy, which is threatening to deſtroy us? Convinced of the folly as well as guilt, of vainly relying on the ſtrength of man—convinced of the high importance of rendering propitious the great Governor of the world; and taught in his holy word, and in the uniform experience of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that <hi>they</hi> only are happy, who have the Lord for their GOD; let us reſolve, by repentance, to forſake our ſins, and to walk in future, in holineſs and righteouſneſs before him, all the days of our lives. Reverencing, adoring, and obeying the GOD of our fathers; let us obey from the heart, the goſpel of his ſon Jeſus Chriſt; and religiouſly obſerve its divine inſtitutions. Denying ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and worldly luſts, let us live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this world, the faſhion of which is paſſing away. Then ſhall we be a peculiar people to the Lord our GOD. GOD, even our own GOD, ſhall then give us his bleſſing. Our

righteouſneſs ſhall then go before us. Our light and our health ſhall break forth, as the morning, and the glory of the Lord ſhall be our rereward.</p>
