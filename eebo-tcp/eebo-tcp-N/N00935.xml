            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Eph. I. 12.</bibl>
               <q>We,—Who FIRST hoped in Christ.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IT is a memorable passage in <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>btus,</hi> One of the Ancients; <q>The Greatest Philosophers among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> tho they talk'd much about the <hi>Immortality</hi> of the Soul, and the <hi>Felicity</hi> of the Future State, yet by their <hi>Lives</hi> they made it appear, that they did not Believe their own Talk, they really look'd on it as a Trifling Report; But, <hi>Sayes he,</hi> among us <hi>Christians,</hi> the very Boyes &amp; Girles, being assisted by the Power of our Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Saviour, make it apparent, not only
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001118_0003_0FB03E4E63BD42F0"/>
by their <hi>Words,</hi> but also by their <hi>Lives,</hi> that they have a powerful Belief of their having Immortal Souls, and of their coming to Eternal Blessedness in the World to come.</q> Thus we find, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the <hi>children</hi> in the Primitive Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, commended by one of the Renowned <hi>Fathers.</hi> May <hi>the Lord so Bless thy Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the midst of thee,</hi> O NEW ENG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND, that <hi>boy</hi> may deserve such a Commendation!</p>
            <p>It is a most agreeable, and a most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Thing, for the Ministers of the Gospel, whose <hi>Love</hi> to the Lord Jesus Christ obliges them to <hi>Feed His Lambs,</hi> to take every Occasion, for the pressing of Early Piety. Methinks I see a fair Occasion for it, in the Text, which from <hi>The Gospel of the Ephesians,</hi> now falls into our Hands. Our Apostle mentioning the Great Things done by the <hi>Grace</hi> of God, for His Chosen People, he proceeds, more particularly, to mention the <hi>Subjects,</hi> upon whom the <hi>Triumphs of Grace</hi> are multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. These are <hi>first,</hi> the Elect of God among the <hi>Jews;</hi> and <hi>then,</hi> the Elect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> The Former are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed in the words now before us; And, Behold a singular Priviledge of the <hi>Jewish Converts.</hi> It is proposed as a singular Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001118_0004_0FB03E5264C03400"/>
and Advantage to be, <hi>The First,</hi> who <hi>Hoped in Christ</hi> Or to Go before others in Christianity. For this then be the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> that we shall insist upon.</p>
            <p>It is a Glorious Priviledge and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to Go before others in Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Christianity.</p>
            <p>Singular is the Comfort of those Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, who get the start of others, in <hi>Early Believing</hi> on the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>Let us receive this Truth with the <hi>Love of it,</hi> in the Ensuing <hi>Propositions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. They who are <hi>Older</hi> than others in <hi>Christianity,</hi> are in some regards to be preferr'd before other Christians. They that <hi>First have Believed</hi> on the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, should in some regards <hi>be first Esteemed</hi> among the People of the Lord Jesus Christ. There is a <hi>Seniority</hi> in <hi>Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity,</hi> as well as in other Points, which is to be accounted <hi>Sacred</hi> among all <hi>Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians.</hi> It is required, Rom. 13. 7. <hi>Render to all their Dues, Honour to whom Honour.</hi> Now there is a <hi>special Honour due</hi> to <hi>Elder Christians,</hi> on the score of their being so. The <hi>Fifth</hi> Commandment requires us, to treat All men, with Respects agreeable
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001118_0005_0FB03E532AE39958"/>
to the <hi>Place</hi> and <hi>Worth,</hi> which God has given them. It is Enjoined, 1 Pet. 2. 17. <hi>Honour all men.</hi> And we must especially <hi>Honour Old Men;</hi> And we must <hi>Honour Old Saints</hi> yet more especially. All <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority</hi> is to be Dutifully acknowledged. <hi>Superiority</hi> in <hi>Age,</hi> calls for very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Acknowledgments. It is an Edict of Heaven, Lev. 19. 32. <hi>Thou Shalt rise up before the Hoary Head, and Honour the Face of the Old Man, and Fear thy God.</hi> Now the <hi>Age</hi> of mens Christianity, may justly call for a peculiar Consideration, in the esteem of all other Christians. <hi>An Hoary Head found in the may of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi> and most of all, if it had entred that way, long before its growing <hi>Hoary;</hi> tis a most Honourable sight. We may see some, that Knew <hi>God,</hi> and Serv'd <hi>Christ,</hi> and Forsook <hi>Sin,</hi> and Walk'd <hi>Religiously,</hi> long before us; Yea, perhaps they were <hi>New-born</hi> before we were <hi>Born</hi> at all. How much, with what Reverence, with what Affection, ought we to prefer those <hi>Old Christians</hi> above our selves? The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <hi>Paul,</hi> could not speak of such as were <hi>Converted</hi> before him, without some Confession, that they were to be <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred</hi> before him; Sayes he, Rom. 16. 8. <hi>They are of Note,—they were in Christ
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001118_0006_0FB03E557B00B4B0"/>
before me. Aged Christians</hi> must be Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured with <hi>special Civilities.</hi> It becomes <hi>Younger Christians</hi> to look on <hi>Aged Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians,</hi> as their <hi>Fathers;</hi> and speak of them, and speak to them, with a <hi>Filial</hi> Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. When we see <hi>Elder Christians,</hi> we may suppose, <q>These are they that have <hi>done more</hi> for <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Christ;</hi> that have more mortified the <hi>Sin that easily besets</hi> us all; that have more <hi>Experience</hi> in the Right wayes of the Lord; that are more Able to encounter <hi>Temptations;</hi> that are better <hi>Souldiers</hi> in the <hi>Wars of the Lord:</hi> that are more acquainted with <hi>Heaven,</hi> and more prepared for <hi>Heaven;</hi> than we that came long after them into the <hi>Vineyard of the LORD.</hi>
               </q> No small Regards are due on such Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.</p>
            <p n="2">II. They in whom the <hi>Christianity</hi> of any <hi>Society,</hi> hath its <hi>Beginning,</hi> have a <hi>Preheminence</hi> in some sort, above the rest of the Christians in the <hi>Society.</hi> The <hi>First Believers,</hi> of any <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, are Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers upon whom God hath put a Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity above the rest. When <hi>Christianity</hi> comes into any Family, or Town, or Land, there are some who <hi>First</hi> embrace it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others. Now the <hi>First</hi> Christians of any <hi>Society,</hi> are most eminently above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

favoured of the Lord. We read, 1 Cor. 16. 15. <hi>I beseech you, Brethren (ye know she House of Stephanas</hi> [which seems to have been the Gaoler, Act 16. 27.] <hi>that it is the First-fruits of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,) that ye submit your selves unto such.</hi> The <hi>First-fruits</hi> are in some sort, the <hi>Best-fruits.</hi> In the <hi>First-fruit,</hi> there is a special Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency; And that which makes them especially Excellent, is the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which they give of <hi>more Fruits</hi> to follow. The <hi>First Converts</hi> of any Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or People, or Nation, have a special Remark of the Divine Favour upon them. The <hi>First-born</hi> have a claim to an <hi>Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency</hi> above the rest. Hence that passage, in the Blessing of <hi>Reuben</hi> Gen. 49. 3. <hi>My First born, the Excellency of Dignity.</hi> To be the <hi>First-born of God</hi> in any Society, is to have yet a more Extraordinary <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Dignity.</hi> God, in the <hi>Effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Calling</hi> of them that are <hi>First called</hi> unto Him, in any Society, proclames His <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguishing</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> unto these in His Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> And the Lord often makes a <hi>Distinguishing Use</hi> of the <hi>first Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi> for the Awakening, the Assistence, the Direction of these that are afterwards to be made partakers of <hi>Effectual Calling?</hi> In such <hi>First</hi> our Lord Jesus Christ, (as
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001118_0008_0FB03E5878D6BC48"/>
the Apostle speaks, 1 Tim. 1. 16.) <hi>shows forth,</hi> what may be for <hi>an example to them that should hereafter Believe on Him, to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver lasting Life.</hi> In the Primitive Churches, they that were <hi>First Called,</hi> were by the Apostles often Constituted the Pastors, of the Flocks that followed them; And our Lord Jesus Christ more often makes them the <hi>Pattern</hi> of them that are to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. It may be partly for this cause, that the History of the Bible singles out these and those <hi>Elders obtaining a Good Report</hi> for our Entertainment and Instruction: It singles out these and those, when there is nothing said of many Thousands that may have been equal to them, for the Grace of God. Why so? Because usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally these were the <hi>First</hi> that shone with any Eminency in that Grace; and being <hi>the First,</hi> God will have them to shine brighter in His History, than any of the rest. Yea, more than so; By those that are <hi>First</hi> Converted in any Family, or People or Nation, God, as it were, takes Hold of the Kindred, &amp; gives Assurance, for the Conversion of more in His Time. The <hi>Jews</hi> who <hi>First</hi> Received the Lord Jesus Christ, Encourage us to expect a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001118_0009_0FB03E5D8A6A13A0"/>
the Lord.</hi> It is thus argued, Rom. 11. 16. <hi>If the First-fruit be Holy, the Lump is also Holy.</hi> And perhaps, there is no People or Nation, that has had any Quantity of Christians in it, but notwithstanding any horrible Apostasy and Calamity, &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion intervening, yet God will have a <hi>Reserve</hi> of more Christians, to be Gathered unto Him, from that People and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the <hi>Latter Dayes,</hi> when <hi>People shall gather together, and Kingdoms to serve the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. They that <hi>Betimes</hi> come to Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ianity, by an <hi>Early Repentance,</hi> in the <hi>First Years</hi> of their Lives, have glorious Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, above those who <hi>Delay Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a being <hi>First in Believing</hi> on the Lord Jesus Christ, by a more <hi>Early</hi> Christianity, than what is common in the Christian world. It is, alas, too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, for persons to Delay the Action of giving themselves up unto the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ by Faith, until some considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Number of Years have rolled over them. They let their <hi>Youth</hi> much of it, roll away, before they become serious Christians. But there are some, who are more <hi>Early</hi> in their Christianity; They make more <hi>Haste</hi> in Believing on the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001118_0010_0FB03E60DFE89C10"/>
Lord Jesus Christ. They <hi>are First</hi> even before others, in making sure of their Salvation. They do not spend their <hi>Youth,</hi> no, nor it may be, all their <hi>Child-hood,</hi> in <hi>Vanity.</hi> They do <hi>betimes</hi> Consecrate themselves unto the service of the Lord. Now, of these, tis to be asserted, That <hi>Early Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> gives a very glorious Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to them that have it.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>What Advantage</hi> have they that are <hi>First,</hi> or more Early in Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ, above those that make it more <hi>Late,</hi> or do more lag and flag in that important matter? Why, <hi>Much every way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, <hi>Early Piety</hi> and Repentance, is more <hi>Acceptable</hi> than <hi>Delay'd Repentance.</hi> The more <hi>Early</hi> we are in our Obedience to God, the more <hi>Conformable</hi> and <hi>Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> we are to the Commandment of God; For the Commandment of God enjoyns <hi>Early Obedience,</hi> yea, it enjoyns <hi>Present O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</hi> The motto upon the Command is, To Day. We read 2 Joh. 4. <hi>I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced greatly, that I found of thy Children walking in the Truth, as we have received a Commandment from the Father.</hi> Truly, is the <hi>Commandment of the Father,</hi> even unto you that are <hi>Children,</hi> that you should <hi>Walk</hi> according to the Directions
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001118_0011_0FB03E6296C423E8"/>
of His Holy <hi>Truth.</hi> And if it be <hi>Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table</hi> unto Good men, who will thereat <hi>Rejoyce greatly,</hi> to see you doing so, how much more <hi>Acceptable</hi> will it be, to the GOD of all Goodness? The Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God is, <hi>Let the Wicked for sake his way, and let him turn unto the Lord.</hi> The Commandment of God is, <hi>Work out your own Salvation.</hi> And, <hi>This His Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That we Believe on the Name of His Son Jesus Christ. Young</hi> People as well as <hi>Old,</hi> are concerned in the Commandment. And it is very particularly directed unto <hi>Young</hi> People, when it is said, Eccl. 12 1. <hi>Remember now thy Creator in the Dayes of thy Youth.</hi> Now, the more <hi>Conformable</hi> we are in our Obedience, to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God, the more <hi>Acceptable</hi> is our Obedience. If it could be said, Act. 17. 30. <hi>God now commands all men e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where to Repent,</hi> then tis plain, <hi>He now commands Young men to Repent,</hi> yea, and <hi>Now to Repent.</hi> It is therefore high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleasing to the most High God, that <hi>Young Men</hi> should not put off Repentance. The Debt of <hi>Obedience,</hi> that we owe unto God, the sooner we pay it, the more pleasing will be the payment. God hath no where said. <hi>Let Young people To <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001118_0012_0FB03E63DE8F22A8"/>
ye NOW every one from his evil way.</hi> It is Acceptable unto Him, then to see them do so! The God of Heaven has indeed most expresly declared His most gracious and grateful Acceptance of <hi>Early Piety.</hi> What a Charming word is That; Prov. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 17. <hi>I love them that love me, They that seek me Early shall find me.</hi> Our Lord Jesus Christ had one Disciple, whom He peculiarly own'd, as His <hi>Beloved Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> And this was, it seems, the <hi>Youngest</hi> of all His Disciples. Oh! The Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent <hi>Love,</hi> which the Lord Jesus Christ has for the more <hi>Early Seekers</hi> of Him! And, <hi>Behold, what manner of Love, the Father</hi> bestows on them, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times acknowledge Him as their <hi>Father!</hi> All Returning Sinners are welcome to the Lord; but He makes none so wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, as those that are most <hi>Early</hi> in the Return. There is no melody more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful in the Ears of Heaven, than the <hi>Prayers of Young People,</hi> Beseeching and Besieging of Heaven. The sooner we list our selves under the Banner of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Kinder will be the <hi>Notice</hi> He will take of us, the Richer the <hi>Reward</hi> He will give to us. We say, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, <hi>dat qui cito dat,</hi> A Grant made with Dispatch, is a <hi>Double Grant.</hi> This we
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001118_0013_0FB03E642A7A0600"/>
may say, <hi>Early Piety</hi> is <hi>Double Piety.</hi> They are the Young <hi>Samuels,</hi> and the Young <hi>Timothies,</hi> that are the Favourites of the Lord. How can it be so <hi>Acceptable</hi> unto God, for the Children of men, to offer their <hi>Flower</hi> unto the <hi>Devil,</hi> and their <hi>Bran</hi> unto their Maker and their Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our? No; tis more, far more Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, to shake off the <hi>Yoke</hi> of the <hi>Devil,</hi> and cease to be <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Belial,</hi> even while we are yet <hi>Children,</hi> and be as <hi>Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> as we can, in putting our selves under the <hi>Yoke</hi> of our Heavenly Lord. The <hi>Earlier</hi> we begin to be for God, the more will He do for us; Yea, the more in <hi>that very thing</hi> He does for us. There is no such Token under Heaven, of one very dear to Heaven, as <hi>Early Piety;</hi> Or, for one betimes to have much of <hi>Heaven</hi> in him.</p>
            <p>Secondly; <hi>Early Piety</hi> and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, is more <hi>Honourable</hi> than <hi>Delay'd Repentance.</hi> Is not a Child of God, more <hi>Honourable</hi> than a Child of <hi>Satan?</hi> A Servant of the Lord Jesus Christ, more <hi>Honourable</hi> than a Vassal of the <hi>Devil?</hi> An Heir of an <hi>Heavenly Crown,</hi> more <hi>Honourable,</hi> than an Heir of <hi>Death,</hi> and a Fire-brand of <hi>Hell?</hi> We may say, Psa, 149. 9. <hi>This Honour have all the Saints.</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:001118_0014_0FB03E64E4B7CBA8"/>
Well, but the sooner we come to this <hi>Honour,</hi> the more <hi>Honourable</hi> are we. By <hi>Early Piety</hi> we do betimes come to the best <hi>Honour</hi> in the world. Is it not an <hi>Honour</hi> to be the <hi>Excellent in the Earth,</hi> and, <hi>more Excellent than ones Neighbour?</hi> Tis affirmed, Psal. 16. 3. <hi>The Saints are the Excellent in the Earth;</hi> and Prov. 12. 26. <hi>The Just is more Excellent than his Neighbour.</hi> Then <hi>Early Piety</hi> is a very <hi>Honourable</hi> Thing; for it will render us, <hi>more excellent,</hi> even than <hi>the excellent.</hi> We Excel even the <hi>Excellent</hi> themselves, when we become <hi>Saints,</hi> and become <hi>Just,</hi> sooner than the rest of the <hi>Saints</hi> and of the <hi>Just.</hi> Certainly, 'tis more <hi>Honourable</hi> to be Conversing with God, in the Noble exercises of <hi>Piety,</hi> than to be Debasing and Debauching our selves, in the <hi>Beastly</hi> wayes of Wickedness. If an <hi>Angel</hi> be more <hi>Honourable</hi> than a <hi>Beast,</hi> it must be so! Sinful Man, Thou art a <hi>Beast,</hi> until <hi>Repentance</hi> do recover thee. It is <hi>Honourable</hi> to be <hi>Reasonable. Folly</hi> is a <hi>Dishonour.</hi> Tis a <hi>Shame,</hi> to play the <hi>Fool. Religion</hi> is the most <hi>Reasonable</hi> thing that ever was. The sooner we become <hi>Religious,</hi> the sooner we come to our Witts, and come to act as <hi>Reasonable</hi> men. We are truly advised, Psal. 111. 10.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001118_0015_0FB03E65A55B7230"/>
               <hi>The Fear of the Lord is the Beginning of Wisdom, a Good Understanding have all they who do those things</hi> that are in it. Is it not more <hi>Honourable</hi> to do the part of a <hi>Wise man,</hi> and act with the Highest <hi>Reason,</hi> that it can be, to do nothing but <hi>Play the Fool?</hi> Sinner, so long as thou deferrest thy <hi>Repentance;</hi> thou art so long a <hi>Fool;</hi> Yea, <hi>Madness is thine Heart. Young People</hi> sometimes make it an Objection against <hi>Early Piety;</hi> They shall be <hi>Despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,</hi> and perhaps <hi>Derided</hi> for it. But, <hi>Behold, Ye Despisers, and Wonder</hi> at your own unspeakable Infatuation; <hi>Reason</hi> is <hi>Despised</hi> by <hi>Folly; Wisdom</hi> is <hi>Derided</hi> by <hi>Madness,</hi> when you <hi>Mock</hi> at Early <hi>Piety.</hi> Be advised of This, and then, <hi>Mock on,</hi> if you Resolve to <hi>Perish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly; <hi>Early Piety</hi> and Repentance, is more <hi>comfortable</hi> than <hi>Delay'd Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> What are the <hi>wayes of Piety,</hi> but <hi>wayes of Pleasancy:</hi> We read, Prov. 3. 17. <hi>Her wayes are wayes of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.</hi> Well then, the sooner thou comest into those wayes, the more of <hi>Pleasure</hi> and of <hi>Comfort,</hi> will thy Life be sweetned withal. The more <hi>Early</hi> thou art in thy Piety, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> sooner shalt thou <hi>See</hi> thy <hi>Name written
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001118_0016_0FB03E69AFC44198"/>
in Heaven,</hi> to which no Delight on Earth is comparable; the sooner shalt thou <hi>Hear</hi> the <hi>very Great and Precious Promise</hi> of God Ravishing of thee with their continual Melody; the sooner shalt thou <hi>Taste</hi> that <hi>the Lord is Gracious</hi> in the Entertainments of a Fellow-ship with Him; and the sooner shalt thou <hi>Feel</hi> the Divine Consolations of the Holy Spirit, which are <hi>not Small,</hi> reviving of thee. By <hi>Dela<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing</hi> of Repentance, men put themselves under grievous and woful Disadvantages. Tis therefore a more Advantagious and Comfortable thing to <hi>Repent Betimes;</hi> Yea, My Child, <hi>As soon as ever thou canst.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are especially Two very asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing Mischiefs of a <hi>Delay'd Repentance;</hi> and it is a most comfortable Thing, to be by <hi>Early Repentance</hi> rescued from those Mischiefs.</p>
            <p>First; A <hi>Delay'd Repentance</hi> will be a <hi>Difficult Repentance.</hi> We read, Jer. 13. 23. <hi>Can the Moor change his Skin, or the Leopard his Spotts? Then may ye also do Good, that are accustomed to do Evil.</hi> A Delay to <hi>Repeat</hi> of <hi>Evil-doing,</hi> produces <hi>Customs</hi> to <hi>do Evil.</hi> How hard is it, forto be brought off an <hi>Evil Custome?</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:001118_0017_0FB03E6A2C9CC2D8"/>
When our <hi>Corrupt Nature,</hi> is become a <hi>Second Nature,</hi> how uneasy is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest over it. The most <hi>Early</hi> Piety, is the most <hi>Easy</hi> Piety. The less <hi>Inveterate</hi> the Maladies of our Souls are, the more easily performed is the Cure of them. <hi>Early</hi> Piety prevents the Inveteracy of our Maladies. Tis true, All things are <hi>alike Easy</hi> to that <hi>Omnipotent Arm</hi> which <hi>Heals all our Diseases;</hi> but the Patient must undergo the more Trouble, to be Healed, the longer he has been under his <hi>Diseases.</hi> The <hi>Old Man</hi> within us, will be subdued with the less of Trouble and Anguish unto us, if we set upon subduing of it, before we grow <hi>Old</hi> our selves. The <hi>Devil</hi> will be <hi>Dispossessed,</hi> with the less of Tearing Agony, where he has less <hi>Prescription to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
               </hi> for his <hi>Possession.</hi> The <hi>Weeds of Hell</hi> in our Hearts, the sooner they are Plucked up, the less <hi>Rooted</hi> they are, and so the more easily plucked up. Soul, Thou art but <hi>Harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>Confirming</hi> thy self in Sin while thou dost not <hi>Repent</hi> of thy Sin. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py the Soul that gets rid of an <hi>hard Heart,</hi> wile tis most Easy to get rid of it. The <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ, for the most part works more Easily upon the Hearts; that are by an <hi>Early
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001118_0018_0FB03E6ADFE9D490"/>
Repentance</hi> brought home unto Him; so <hi>Easily,</hi> that indeed often it is not <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly.</hi> He as it were steals His Grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Hearts; They don't know the Time, of their being first United to the Lord Jesus Christ; It is done by so <hi>Soft,</hi> so <hi>Sweet</hi> so <hi>Gradual</hi> Methods! They find, they are in the Lord Jesus Christ, but they don't know, how they First came to be so!</p>
            <p>Secondly; A <hi>Delay'd Repentance</hi> will be a <hi>Dubious Repentance.</hi> It is an awful Hint; Prov. 27. 1. <hi>Boast not thy self of To morrow, for thou knowest not what a Day may bring forth.</hi> Early <hi>Piety</hi> puts it of Doubt, that our Souls are safe, and we may thereupon <hi>Rejoyce in the Hope of the Glory of God.</hi> But while we put off the care of our Immortal Souls, we run the dread fullest, and the desperatest Hazards, that can be run <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> by Mortal men; even the Hazards of losing our Souls forever. We promise our selves, that <hi>Hereafter</hi> we shall make our Peace with God; but God hath given us no promise of any <hi>Hereafter.</hi> Let any man show me any one word in all the Bible, where God hath engaged unto any man, <hi>A space to Repent;</hi> and I will venture to say, <hi>Procrastinate.</hi> But in the mean
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001118_0019_0FB03E75866C16B8"/>
Time, what an horrible Venture dost thou run, O Fool-hardy Creature? <hi>Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Repentance,</hi> is the only way, to live our of Extreme and Hourly Danger, to be cast into Eternal Perdition. There are many who Dy in <hi>Youth:</hi> It was of Old said, <hi>The Young Men are Dead.</hi> And as an <hi>Early</hi> Death, so a <hi>Sudden</hi> Death is the portion of not a few: It may be said of them, <hi>b<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But the <hi>Glorious</hi> God is infinitely sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, in the Manifestations, the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and the Exhibitions of His <hi>Glory.</hi> The First Being is admirably, <hi>Energetick.</hi> God from all Eternity, Beholding of Himself, there was <hi>Begotten</hi> an <hi>Image</hi> of Himself. This is the <hi>Son of God,</hi> the <hi>Brightness of His Glory, the Express Image of His Person.</hi> Infinite is the Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God, from all Eternity, in behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of His <hi>Glory,</hi> as it is Expressed in His <hi>Only Begotten Son;</hi> whose Triumph it is, <hi>I was set up from Everlasting, I was brought forth before the Mountains were settled; Then was I daily His De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light!</hi> And why did God, so satisfied from all ETERNITY, proceed unto the <hi>Works</hi> of Creation, and Providence, even unto all the <hi>Works of Time?</hi> This is, that He may take the satisfaction of Beholding His own <hi>Glory,</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="unknown:001118_0038_0FB03EA4AB105290"/>
as it is Expressed in all His <hi>Works.</hi> If the Works of God had no other Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, but the God who has wrought them all; This, This were enough; This were infinitely more, than for all the <hi>Works</hi> to take Notice of themselves, or of one another.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, 'Tis a particular Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, unto the <hi>Glorious God,</hi> that <hi>Rational Beings</hi> do particularly observe the <hi>Manifestations</hi> of His <hi>Glory.</hi> There are <hi>Intellectual Beings,</hi> formed by the <hi>Great God, that formeth All Things.</hi> There is a World of <hi>Spirits;</hi> Angels and Men, Things that have <hi>Reasonable Spirits</hi> in them, are made by that God, who is the <hi>Father of Spirits.</hi> That <hi>Spiritual World</hi> is a Million of Times more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable, than the <hi>Corporeal World.</hi> These <hi>Intellectual Beings</hi> are capable of Observing and Regarding and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the <hi>Glory</hi> of God. God sayes, <hi>I formed them for my self, to shew forth my Praise.</hi> Thus <hi>Good</hi> is our God!</p>
               <p>Now God will have us to <hi>Glorify</hi> Him, in Declaring the <hi>Praises of His Glory,</hi> falling under our Observation. And in these two wayes, are we to Declare the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:001118_0039_0FB03EA5C4EB7DB0"/>
                  <hi>Praise</hi> of the <hi>Glorious God.</hi> First, We must our selves <hi>Acknowledge the Glory</hi> of God; and be sensible of those <hi>Glorious</hi> Things in God, that shall draw us, to Fear Him, and Love Him, and Seek Him, and Serve Him; and make His Will the only Rule of our Life, and count His Good Will to be better than Life. And then, We must Invite and Engage <hi>Others,</hi> to joyn with us, in those <hi>Acknowledgments</hi> of God; So that from what we are, or have, or do, <hi>Honourable Thoughts of God</hi> shall be Raised in the minds of <hi>Others,</hi> and <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> shall devote themselves unto the Lord.</p>
               <p>This tis, <hi>To Glorify God.</hi> This is all the <hi>Revenue,</hi> that God Expects, of all that He does for us. Yea, Tis that for which He brings us to all the <hi>Glory</hi> of Heaven at the Last! And all those whom He brings to Heaven, He does first inspire with a Disposition, to make Choice of this above all things, <hi>That they may be thus unto the Praise of His Glory.</hi>
