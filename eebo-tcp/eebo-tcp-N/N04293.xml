            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Within this Period, which I ſhall diſtinguiſh by the Name of the third Period of the Bills <hi>l.</hi>458,000 was emitted upon <hi>Funds of Taxes,</hi> for defraying the neceſſary Charges of the Government, and <hi>l.</hi> 260,000 upon four <hi>Loans</hi> made chiefly for increaſing the <hi>Paper Medium;</hi> the firſt of theſe Emiſſions upon Loan was of <hi>l.</hi> 50,000 in 1714, to be let out by a Committee nam'd in the Act to the Inhabitants of the <hi>Province</hi> in certain Proportions according to their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <add>was in 1716, of <hi>l.</hi> 100,000, with the</add> ſame Appropriation of <add>the Profits, and under the like Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>All the Bills of the <hi>l.</hi>48,000 Loan in 1711 were drawn in and burnt long ſince; but there is ſtill outſtanding of the <hi>l.</hi> 50,000 emitted in 1714, about <hi>l.</hi> 2000, with the like Arrear due for Intereſt; of the <hi>l.</hi> 100,000 Loan in 1716, about <hi>l.</hi> 7000, of the <hi>l.</hi> 50,000 Loan in 1720, <hi>l.</hi> 16, and of that of <hi>l.</hi> 60,000 in 1727, about <hi>l.</hi> 500; All which Sums are well ſecur'd, and may be expected to be drawn in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in five or ſix Months.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:005302_0008_1016F91EEF34BB68"/>
I ſhall further obſerve upon theſe ſeveral Loans, That the firſt of 'em in 1711 was at leaſt excuſable, if not a laudable Inſtance of the Province's Zeal for his Majeſty's Service; but that the four ſubſequent Loans, which had not the ſame Reaſon for their Emiſſion, very much contributed by the largeneſs of their Sums and long Periods to depreciate the Bills of Credit in general, and in Conjunction with the <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> Loans, whoſe Bills begun now to obtain a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Currency in this Province, even to leſſen the real Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of that Medium of Trade, which they were deſign'd to increaſe; And that the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> Government has long been ſo ſenſible of the Country's Error in making theſe Loans, that they would not, I am perſuaded, be in Danger of relapſing into it, tho' they ſhould be under no Reſtraint from His Majeſty's Inſtruction to his Governour.</p>
            <p>In this Period alſo theſe further Particulars are obſervable,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Bills continu'd to be taken at the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury at 5 <hi>per Cent</hi> Advance 'till 1718, ever ſince which Year that Allowance upon the Payment of the Bills has been taken off by the General Court under a Notion that it did not contribute towards ſupporting the Value of the Bills.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Silver and Gold Currency now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd more and more every Year, and about the Year 1726 quite vaniſh'd, and coin'd Silver and Gold became from that Time mere Merchandize.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the Periods for drawing back the Bills emitted upon <hi>Funds of Taxes</hi> into the Treaſury were more and more protracted, 'till by the Year 1721 they were lengthen'd out to the Diſtance of thirteen Years from their reſpective Emiſſions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That the Inſtances of the Aſſembly's poſtpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Apportionment of the Taxes for drawing in the Bills according to their limited Periods were very rare, and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005302_0009_1016F921C6C29358"/>
the Bills were generally actually drawn into the Treaſury till 1721, ſince which Year large Sums of the Bills emitted upon <hi>Funds of Taxes</hi> were ſuffer'd by the Government to be outſtanding beyond their ſtated Periods for want of Executions being iſſued out againſt the deficient Collectors of the Taxes according to the Province Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mention'd, ſo that by the End of the Year 1730 <hi>l.</hi> 164,755 5<hi>ſ.</hi> 5<hi>d.</hi> was outſtanding by that Means.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> That the before-mention'd Province Law for making <hi>Bills</hi> of Credit a <hi>Tender</hi> prov'd in its Operation, during this whole Period, extremely injurious to ſuch Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, as had not aſcertain'd the Value of their outſtanding Debts either in Sterling or Proclamation Money by ſpecial Contracts: For by Force of it all other Creditors were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to accept of Province Bills according to their nominal Value, Penny for Penny, in Satisfaction of their Debts, tho' the Bills were greatly depreciated between the Time of the Debts being contracted and the Payment of them, ſo that great Loſſes enſued continually to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Merchants trading to <hi>New-England,</hi> by ſuffering large Diſcounts upon their Debts, and to Widows and Orphans within the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince in particular: It alſo proved miſchievous in this Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that as the Debtor was by Means of the Act a Gainer by the depreciating of the Bills, and the longer his Debt was outſtanding the more the Value of it was diminiſhed, he was tempted to uſe every Artifice to keep his Creditor out of his juſt Due, to which he was alſo encouraged by the Fees of the Court of Judicature's being ſo leſſen'd through the depreciating of the Bills in which they were payable, and the Law's being grown ſo cheap that the People were habituated to ſuffer themſelves to be ſued for indiſputable Debts, and an Inſenſibility of the Diſcredit of it ſo much prevail'd, that it was not uncommon even for Perſons of ſome Circumſtances and Character to ſuffer Judgments to be given againſt 'em by <hi>Default</hi> to the Superiour Court of Judicature merely for Delay, whereby Law-Suits were ſcandalouſly multiply'd, and a litigious Spirit promoted among the lower Sort of People.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:005302_0010_1016F9234BB8CB20"/>
This Law firſt expir'd in 1715, was afterwards re-enacted in 1716, expir'd again in 1722, and was then reviv'd and continu'd to <hi>October</hi> 1730, and upon every Trial of it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd the ſame Miſchiefs, ſo that its pernicous Effects could not be in the leaſt doubted.</p>
            <p>Hitherto His Majeſty's Governours were under no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint from his Royal Inſtructions as to the Bills of Credit current in the Province, except that they were enjoin'd the Obſervation of the Act of the ſixth of Queen ANNE <hi>for aſcertaining the Value of foreign Coins,</hi> and ſo were more excuſably betray'd into ſuffering Emiſſions upon Loans, and immoderate Sums to be outſtanding beyond their ſtated Periods: But in <hi>December</hi> 1730 I find that Governour BELCHER communicated to the Council and Houſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives his Majeſty's 16th and 18th Inſtructions to him, by the former of which he was forbid to <hi>paſs any Act for iſſuing out Bills of Credit without a ſuſpending Clauſe, except only for the annual Support and Service of his Majeſty's Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;</hi> and was ordered to take <hi>eſpecial Care that no more than l.</hi> 30,000 <hi>of ſuch Bills ſhould be ever current at one and the ſame Time;</hi> and by the latter of 'em he was <hi>eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally directed to take Care that the Bills of Credit iſſued ſhould be call'd in and ſunk according to the Periods and Proviſions of the reſpective Acts, by which they were iſſued;</hi> and his Excellency then complain'd in his Speech to the Aſſembly <hi>that the Bills of Credit, according to the then Courſe and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of 'em, were a common Deluſion to Mankind,</hi> and wiſh'd <hi>ſome better Way might be ſeaſonably thought of either by the Legiſlature</hi> or the <hi>People in Trade, whereby they, might be ſupply'd with a better Medium than what then paſs'd;</hi> and when an engroſs'd Bill for reviving the Act to prevent the Oppreſſion of Debtors and make the Bills of Credit a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, then lately expir'd, was laid before him for his Conſent, two or three Days after he rejected it with this Meſſage to the Houſe of Repreſentatives, <hi>that he had not ſign'd the Bill, inaſmuch as he did not think it for his Majeſty's Service or the Good of the Province.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:005302_0011_1016F9276D9EF868"/>
This ſeem'd to afford a promiſing Proſpect, among other Regulations of the Bills, that the great Quantity of 'em then outſtanding beyond their ſtated Periods would be ſoon drawn in, and thoſe Bills, whoſe Periods were not yet arriv'd, would be duly call'd in and ſunk upon their Arrival; and that now an End would be put to the ſeveral Miſchiefs, which had been occaſion'd by the late Law, which made the Bills a Tender; But the Royal Inſtructions ſeem not to have had their proper Influence: For upon comparing the Quantity of Bills, which were outſtanding <hi>beyond their limited Periods</hi> in 1730 with thoſe which were outſtanding in 1741, it appears from the Accounts of the Province Treaſurers given in from Year to Year to the General Court, that the former conſiſting wholly of Bills of the old Tenor did not exceed the Sum of <hi>l.</hi> 1647455 5<hi>s.</hi> 5<hi>d,</hi> and that the latter, which conſiſted of Bills of the old and middle Tenor, being all computed in Bills of the old Tenor, amounted to <hi>l.</hi> 390,863 14<hi>s.</hi> 7<hi>d.</hi> and exceeded the former Sum one third Part in their Value—and the latter Part of the Proſpect ſoon vaniſh'd upon his Excellency's conſenting to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vival of the late Law for preventing the Oppreſſion of Debtors and making the Bills of Credit a Tender, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Proviſion for ſecuring to Creditors the Value of their future Debts againſt the depreciating of the Bills, whereby were reviv'd for ten Years longer the ſame Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, which the Province had ſo long felt before under the Effects of the ſame Law, and the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Merchants ſo juſtly complain'd of.</p>
            <p>During this <hi>Adminiſtration,</hi> which I ſhall call the fourth Period of the Bills, the <hi>General Court</hi> in 1733 re-emitted <hi>l.</hi> 76,500 in old Tenor Bills of the ſame nominal Value with the Bills extant at the Time of reviving the before-mention'd Law in 1731 for making 'em a Tender, but of a leſs real Value by 20 <hi>per Cent.</hi> and in 1734 made another Re-emiſſion of Bills of like nominal but leſs real Value by 60 <hi>per Cent,</hi> and in 1735 another Re-emiſſion of Bills, of like nominal but a leſs real Value by 160 <hi>per Cent;</hi> all which Bills, tho' ſo much depreciated at the <hi>Time</hi> of their

reſpective Re-emiſſions below the Value of the Bills in 1731, were by Force of the before-mention'd Province Law made a <hi>Tender</hi> for the Payment of Debts contracted in the Year 1731, at which Time Bills were of a much higher Value, ſo that the making of thoſe three Re-emiſſions of deprecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Bills, without providing that Creditors ſhould have an Allowance for their being ſunk below the Value of Bills in 1731, was the ſame Thing in Effect, as if the <hi>Government</hi> has paſs'd a Law in each of thoſe Years that the Creditors upon ſimple Contract (and ſuch all Creditors in Trade ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally are) ſhould be oblig'd to accept in Satisfaction of their Debts contracted in 1731 20, 60, and 160 <hi>per Cent.</hi> leſs than the real Value of 'em; Which Obſervation will hold in a ſomething leſs Degree with Reſpect to the Debts contracted in 1732, 1733, and 1734.</p>
            <p>This with Regard to the Governour ſeems to have been a moſt unparallel'd Proceeding, <hi>viz.</hi> that he ſhould not only give his <hi>Conſent</hi> to an Act, the paſſing of which he had but five Months before publickly declar'd to the Aſſembly would be <hi>neither for his Majeſty's Service nor the good of the Province,</hi> without making the leaſt Proviſion for preventing the Act's former miſchievous Effects for the future, but alſo go on from Year to Year with his Eyes open to <hi>conſent</hi> to the Emiſſion of ſuch Bills, as at the very Time of their being emitted were, not a <hi>Deluſion,</hi> as his Excellency was pleas'd in his before-mention'd Speech to call the Bills in general, but a <hi>palpable,</hi> groſs <hi>Impoſition</hi> (to ſay no worſe of 'em) upon the Creditor.</p>
            <p>This Law had alſo the ſame pernicious Influence, which it had before, with reſpect to habituating Debtors to ſuffer themſelves to be ſued for indiſputable Debts, and to appeal from Judgments obtain'd againſt 'em upon their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faults to the Superior Court merely for Delay; and as the Fees of the Courts of Judicature were further leſſen'd (dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Continuance of this Law) by the depreciating of the Bills, ſo this Sort of Actions multiply'd in Proportion, to the great Hurt and Scandal of the Country; inſomuch

that the Number of ſuch Suits within the Province was increas'd during this Adminiſtration, <hi>viz.</hi> between the Years 1730 and 1742, to near double what it was before.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1736 the Government emitted <hi>l.</hi> 9000 in Bills of a new Form and Tenor, which afterwards obtain'd the Name of the <hi>middle Tenor</hi> Bills, by which I ſhall here diſtinguiſh 'em.—Theſe Bills were emitted upon <hi>Funds of Taxes</hi> to be drawn back into the Treaſury in 1741, with this Difference between <hi>them</hi> and the old Bills, that by their Tenor they were not to be accepted in Payment for the Duties of Impoſt, Tonnage of Shipping, and Incomes of the Light-Houſe, whereas the old Bills were by <hi>their</hi> Tenor to be accepted by the Treaſurer and ſubordinate Receivers in <hi>all publick Payments</hi> whatſoever; and by this Emiſſion-Act <hi>ſix Shillings and eight Pence</hi> of the middle Tenor Bills were made equal in Value to one Ounce of Troy Weight, Sterling Alloy.—And for better ſupporting the Value of theſe Bills Proviſion was made by the Act, that if any of 'em ſhould happen not to be paid into the Treaſury at their limited Periods, but be outſtanding in the Hands of private Perſons, the Poſſeſſors might at any Time after the laſt Day of <hi>December</hi> 1742 bring 'em to the Treaſury and receive in Exchange for every <hi>ſix Shillings and eight Pence</hi> one Ounce of Silver or the like Value in Gold, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably for a greater or leſs Sum; and the Treaſurer was thereby order'd to exchange 'em accordingly.—And for raiſing a Fund of Silver and Gold for that Purpoſe, as well as for exchanging the Bills of the old Tenor, which were before emitted and ſhould be outſtanding in the Hands of private Perſons after <hi>December</hi> 1742, it was further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by that Act that the Duties of Impoſt and Tonnage of Shipping, together with the Incomes of the Light-Houſe, ſhould be paid in Silver at <hi>ſix Shillings and eight Pence</hi> per Ounce, or in Gold of a proportionable Value, from and after the Seſſion of the General Court in <hi>May</hi> then next following, and until the End of the Seſſion in <hi>May</hi> 1742.</p>

Two Things are obſervable in this Act, 1<hi>ſt.</hi> That it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the old Tenor Bills, as well as thoſe of the middle Tenor, from being receiv'd in Payment for the Duties of Impoſt, Tonnage of Shipping, and Incomes of the Light-Houſe: This the <hi>Government</hi> had a Right to do with Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to the middle Tenor Bills, becauſe it was agreable to the Form and Tenor of 'em; but it was repugnant to the Tenor of the old Bills, by which <hi>they</hi> were to be accepted in <hi>all publick Poyments;</hi> and this the Merchants in the Time of it loudly complain'd of as an Act of Injuſtice to the Poſſeſſors of the old Bills, and a manifeſt Breach of publick Faith; as indeed it muſt be acknowledg'd to have been: And it ſeems an extraordinary Project for raiſing the Value and Credit of the Bills to make Uſe of an Expedient, which had a direct Tendency to leſſen their Credit; For what ſure Dependance could there be upon the Faith of an Act, (made for the ſecuring the Redemption of 'em ſix Years after) which was itſelf a preſent Inſtance of the Violation of the Publick Faith with regard to the old Tenor Bills.</p>
            <p>2<hi>dly.</hi> That at the Time of emitting the middle Tenor Bills the Price of Silver in Bills of the old Tenor was <hi>twenty ſix Shillings and eight Pence</hi> at leaſt per Ounce, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which <hi>twenty Shillings</hi> in old Tenor Bills (which would not purchaſe more than three Quarters of an Ounce of Silver) was by that Act made equal in all publick Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to <hi>ſix Shillings and eight Pence</hi> of the middle Tenor Bills, which by the ſame Act is valued as equal to an Ounce of Silver; and that the ſtating of this Proportion between the Value of theſe Bills, which was as <hi>one</hi> to <hi>three,</hi> when the true Proportion between 'em was <hi>one</hi> to <hi>four,</hi> (<hi>ſix Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and eight Pence</hi> being only a fourth Part of <hi>twenty ſix Shillings and eight Pence</hi>) ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> twenty Shillings</hi> in the old Tenor Bills paſſed in common Currency equal to <hi>ſix Shillings and eight Pence</hi> in Bills of the middle Tenor.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1737 two further Sums of <hi>l.</hi> 20,000, and 6,000 in Bills of the middle Tenor, and in 1738 another Sum of 6,000 in the ſame Tenor were emitted; for draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back all which Bills into the Treaſury in the Years 1738, 1739 and 1740, three ſeveral Taxes of equal Value with thoſe Emiſſions were rais'd and apportion'd by the ſeveral Emiſſion Acts, and ſuch of theſe Bills alſo, as ſhould not be paid into the Treaſury for Taxes at their limited Periods, but remain in the Hands of private Perſons after <hi>December</hi> 1742, were made exchangeable at the Treaſury for Silver and Gold at the ſame Rates with the middle Tenor Bills of the firſt Emiſſion; and it's very remarkable, that notwithſtanding it had been found by Experience that the Bills of the firſt Emiſſion were depreciated 33 and a third <hi>per Cent,</hi> as is before-mention'd, by ſtating the Proportion between them and the outſtanding Bills of the old Tenor as <hi>one</hi> to <hi>three,</hi> or valuing <hi>ſix Shillings and eight Pence</hi> of the middle Tenor Bills at <hi>twenty Shillings</hi> only of the old Tenor Bills, yet the <hi>Government</hi> continued to ſtate the ſame Proportion between the middle Tenor Bills of theſe three other Emiſſions, and the Bills of the old Tenor, not only in all publick Payments, as was done by the Act in 1736, but all private Payments; which had the ſame Effect to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciate the middle Tenor Bills of theſe three laſt Emiſſions ſucceſſively, as the ſtating of the ſame Proportion had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to depreciate thoſe of the firſt Emiſſion, without rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Value of the old Tenor Bills in the leaſt.</p>
            <p>And thus the <hi>Government</hi> perſever'd to miſ-ſtate the Proportion between the Value of the old and middle Tenor Bills, even when the Period limited for exchanging the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding

middle Tenor Bills for Silver and Gold at the Treaſury was within leſs than two Years and an Half of it's Arrival; the Conſequence of which was, that this Error coſt the Country in <hi>December</hi> 1742 the Value of <hi>l.</hi>42,000 old Tenor, to pay the Difference between the falſe Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>ſix Shillings and eight Pence</hi> middle Tenor for <hi>twenty Shillings</hi> in the old Tenor, and the true Proportion of <hi>ſix Shillings and eight Pence</hi> in the former for <hi>twenty ſix Shillings and eight Pence</hi> in the latter.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1740, during the ſame Period, an Act of the General Court was paſs'd at their <hi>May</hi> Seſſion for emitting <hi>l.</hi>80,000 in Bills of the old Tenor, which were not made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemable with Silver &amp; Gold, as the Bills of the middle Tenor were; and a few Days after paſs'd an Order at the ſame Seſſion in <hi>July</hi> directing the Treaſurer to iſſue out ſuch of the Bills (which had been drawn into the Treaſury) both of the old and middle Tenor, as were not worn and defac'd, in lieu of the new Bills, which were to have been ſtruck off, and emitted by Virtue of that Act; and about <hi>l.</hi>17,000 in Bills of the middle Tenor (which had been drawn back in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Treaſury by public Payments) were iſſued out by the Treaſurer accordingly; and the ſame Proportion of <hi>one</hi> to <hi>three</hi> was ſtated between the Bills of the middle Tenor re-emitted by Virtue of this Order, and the Bills of the old Tenor, whereby theſe re-emitted <hi>middle Tenor</hi> Bills were a ſecond Time depreciated 33 and a third <hi>per Cent</hi> in like Manner, as all the other Bills of the ſame Tenor had been from Time to Time, by ſtating the ſame Proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>them</hi> and the old Tenor Bills.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>l.</hi>17,000 Bills indeed having been once drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Treaſury and afterwards re-emitted in lieu of Bills, which the Government had not ſtipulated to exchange for Silver and Gold, were not exchangeable at the Treaſury for thoſe Species, as the other middle Tenor Bills, which ſhould be outſtanding upon the Foot of their Emiſſion Acts after <hi>December</hi> 1742 would be, yet as theſe non-redeemable Bills had no Ear-mark given 'em upon their Re-emiſſion to
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005302_0017_1016F93A2E02EE40"/>
diſtinguiſh 'em from the redeemable Bills, with which they muſt neceſſarily be ſo blended in common Currency, as that the one could not be diſcriminated from the other by <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 1742, it was evident that this Re-emiſſion of the <hi>l.</hi> 17,000 non-redeemable Bills muſt lay the Government under this Dilemma, either to admit the Demands of the Poſſeſſors of the outſtanding non-redeemable Bills in 1742, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change 'em for Silver in the Country's Wrong, or elſe to reject the Demands of the Poſſeſſors of the outſtanding <hi>redeemable</hi> Bills, who could not poſſibly make it appear that the Bills in their Poſſeſſion were not Part of the <hi>non-redeemable</hi> Bills; which would be an Act of great Injuſtice with Regard to <hi>them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>December</hi> following when the Time for exchanging theſe Bills was advanc'd ſix Months nearer, the General Court paſs'd an Impoſt Act, whereby the Duties of Impoſt, Tonnage of Shipping, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> that by the before-mentioned Act in 1736 were made payable 'till the End of <hi>May</hi> Seſſion 1742 in Gold and Silver <hi>only,</hi> which was to remain in the Treaſury as a Fund for exchanging ſuch of the redeemable Bills as ſhould be outſtanding after <hi>December</hi> 1742, were from thenceforward made payable in <hi>Bills</hi> both of the old and <hi>middle</hi> Tenor, ſo that <hi>twenty Shillings</hi> in the former, and <hi>ſix Shillings and eight Pence</hi> in the latter were from that Time accepted by the Impoſt Officer in Payment for thoſe Duties in lieu of <hi>ſix Shillings and eight Pence</hi> in coin'd Silver, or Gold of a proportionable Value: And the Treaſurer was by that Clauſe of the Act impower'd and directed to purchaſe Silver and Gold with the Bills thus paid in—By this Means the Fund provided in 1736 for the Security of the Poſſeſſors of the redeemable Bills, and to enable the Treaſurer to exchange 'em after <hi>December</hi> 1742 was from that Time neceſſarily leſſen'd at leaſt one third Part, or 33 and a 3d <hi>per Cent.</hi> as to the Duties to be collected from <hi>December</hi> 1740 till the End of <hi>May</hi> Seſſion 1742, (that being the Difference between the Value of the Bills and of the Silver to be purchas'd with 'em) ſo that the paſſing of this Act was in Effect deſtroying the <hi>Fund</hi> in Part, and ſo

far <hi>repealing</hi> that Clauſe of the Act of 1736, which rais'd it for the Redemption of the outſtanding redeemable Bills in 1742, and ought to have been held inviolable, eſpecially by the Governour who is forbidden by His Majeſty's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to conſent to <hi>the repealing</hi> of any Act (<hi>and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently any Part of an Act.</hi>) without inſerting a ſuſpending Clauſe in the Act, which repeals it, to prevent it's taking Effect, 'till his Majeſty's Royal Pleaſure ſhall be known upon it.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon given in the Act for this Proceeding was that the Payment of the Duties of Impoſt, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> in Silver and Gold had a Tendency to raiſe their Price within the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince: Whereas it is moſt manifeſt that ſuch Payment of the Duties had a direct contrary Tendency by promoting the Importation of Silver and Gold into the Province by Maſters of Veſſels liable to the Payment of thoſe Duties, who arrive here from Countries where there is a plenty of Silver and Gold: And on the other Hand the Treaſurer's pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing Silver and Gold <hi>within</hi> the Province with Bills muſt have as manifeſt a Tendency to raiſe the Price of Silver and Gold in it, and not only to depreciate the Bills in general, but to keep many of the <hi>middle</hi> Tenor Bills outſtanding beyond <hi>December</hi> 1742.</p>
            <p>It is not improbable that the repeated Complaints of the Merchants might have a conſiderable Weight with the <hi>Government</hi> in Favour of the <hi>old</hi> Bills for admitting <hi>them</hi> to be receiv'd in Payment of the Duties of Impoſt, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> for the future, according to the Tenor of 'em, tho' ſuch Motive could not with a good Grace be expreſs'd in the Act, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> that would have been a tacit Acknowlegement, that the Excluſion of 'em from being accepted the three former Years was a Wrong done to the Poſſeſſors: But whatever Neceſſity the <hi>Government</hi> might apprehend it ſelf to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, with Regard to the old Tenor Bills, of breaking into the Fund rais'd for the Redemption of 'em by the before-mention'd Act of 1736, it was certainly under none with Reſpect to the <hi>middle</hi> Tenor Bills; and the admitting of

               <hi>them,</hi> contrary to their very Form and Tenor, to be receiv'd for thoſe Duties in lieu of Silver or Gold, in Diminution of the <hi>Fund,</hi> was as manifeſt a Breach of the publick Faith as the excluding of the <hi>old</hi> Tenor Bills was at firſt.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1741, Governour BELCHER'S Adminiſtration ended and the preſent <hi>Governour'</hi>s ſucceeded it, at which Time there was outſtanding beyond their ſtated Periods for want of Executions being iſſued out, according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince Law, againſt the deficient Collectors of the Taxes, to compell 'em to bring in their ſeveral Rates purſuant to the Treaſurer's Warrants, 267,964 <hi>l.</hi> 14 <hi>ſ.</hi> 7<hi>d.</hi> in Province Bills of the old Tenor, and 40,664 <hi>l.</hi> 6 <hi>ſ.</hi> 8<hi>d.</hi> in Bills of the middle Tenor, both which Sums computed in old Tenor make together 390,863 <hi>l.</hi> 14<hi>ſ.</hi> 7<hi>d;</hi> and at the ſame Time were outſtanding further Sums in Bills of the old &amp; middle Tenor amounting in the whole to the Value of <hi>l.</hi> 106,525 old Tenor, for drawing back which laſt mention'd Sums into the Treaſury Taxes ought to have been apportioned in <hi>May</hi> 1739 and 1741, purſuant to their reſpective Emiſſion-Acts, but were poſtpon'd by the Aſſembly during Governour BELCHER'S Adminiſtration; ſo that thoſe Bills were, when he quitted the Chair, outſtanding without any Fund of Taxes for ſinking 'em.</p>
            <p>In <hi>October</hi> 1741 (there being conſiderable Arrears of Wages due to the Officers and Servants of the Government) the Houſe of Repreſentatives and Council paſs'd a Supply Bill, to which the Governor refus'd his <hi>Aſſent,</hi> and pointed out to the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> in a Speech the ſeveral exceptionable Matters contain'd in it; and, among other Amendments, particularly recommended to 'em to make Proviſion for the ſpeedy drawing in of the <hi>l.</hi> 106,525 old Bills, and ſecuring to Creditors the full Value of their future Debts againſt the depreciating of the Bills of Credit; which laſt he preſs'd upon 'em in ſuch Terms, as in Effect to make it a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his <hi>Conſent</hi> to the Bills continuing to be a <hi>Tender:</hi> As to the Arrear of <hi>l.</hi> 390,863 14<hi>ſ.</hi> 7<hi>d.</hi> in Bills outſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beyond their limited Periods, which had been, during

the late Adminiſtration, occaſion'd by the Neglect of His Majeſty's 16th and 18th Inſtructions, which Governour BELCHER had communicated to the Aſſembly, as I have before mention'd, it was in the Governour's Power to draw that in without the Aid of the Aſſembly, as faſt as the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the People would admit of levying ſo heavy a Sum, by cauſing Executions to be iſſued out by the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, purſuant to the Province Law in that Caſe already provided in 1699.—This Recommendation from the Governour had it's proper Influence upon the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> in their <hi>November</hi> Seſſion following, when a Bill was paſs'd for the Supply of the Treaſury, in which Proviſion was made for drawing in, within the Years 1742 &amp; 1743, the outſtanding Bills of Credit, for which no Fund of Taxes had been yet raiſ'd, and a Clauſe was therein inſerted im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering the Treaſurer, in Caſe the <hi>General Court</hi> ſhould not apportion the Taxes for drawing in the Bills at the Times limited by the Act, to iſſue out his Warrants for aſſeſſing and levying 'em in the ſame Proportions, which the laſt Tax-Act had apportion'd the Taxes of the ſeveral Towns in; whereby it was put out of the Power of the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> to poſt-pone the drawing of the Bills in further: And the ſame Clauſe having been repeated in all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Supply-Acts, an effectual Method ſeems now to be eſtabliſh'd for preventing all future <hi>Poſtponing</hi> by the Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>The Bills emitted by this Act were of the ſame Form and Tenor as to the Valuation of 'em, in Reſpect of Silver and Gold, with thoſe of the <hi>middle</hi> Tenor; but the Proportion ſtated between them and the Bills of the old Tenor was as <hi>one</hi> to <hi>four,</hi> inſtead of the former Proportion of <hi>one</hi> to <hi>three,</hi> by which Means they eſcaped the Fate, which all the Emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the middle Tenor Bills had ſhar'd, of being depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated 33 and a 3d <hi>per Cent</hi> below their Denomination, and ſtill keep the ſame Difference in Value between themſelves and the <hi>old</hi> Tenor Bills: and it is evident beyond all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Doubt that if the Proportion of <hi>one</hi> to <hi>four</hi> had been ſtated from the Beginning between the ſeveral Emiſſions of

the <hi>middle</hi> Tenor Bills, and the Bills of the <hi>old</hi> Tenor, it would have ſaved the Province at leaſt the <hi>l.</hi> 8,000 <hi>new</hi> Tenor Bills, which it was oblig'd in <hi>December</hi> 1742 to pay the Poſſeſſors of the <hi>middle</hi> Tenor Bills for the Difference between the two Proportions, ſo that it muſt have been an inexcuſable Error indeed if the <hi>Government</hi> had ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſever'd in a Miſtake, which had been ſo thoroughly prov'd by the Experience of near five Years.</p>
            <p>An Objection has indeed been made againſt raiſing the Denomination of the Bills from that of the <hi>old</hi> Tenor to either that of the <hi>middle</hi> or the <hi>new</hi> Tenor Bills, founded upon a Notion that it has occaſion'd the Riſe of the Price of Silver, and of Proviſions; but it is a Miſtake to imagine that any Denomination of the Bills of Credit whatſoever can affect the Price of Silver, or of any other Commodities in the Province; for beſides that one does not appear to have the leaſt Relation to, or Connection with the other, this ſingle Fact ſeems to be a full Confutation of that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>viz.</hi> That the greateſt Riſe of the Price of Silver, that ever happen'd in the Province within the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of Time, was that between the Years 1733 and 1735, when it roſe from <hi>twenty Shillings</hi> per Ounce in Bills of the old Tenor to <hi>twenty-ſeven Shillings</hi> and <hi>ſix Pence,</hi> that is near 34 <hi>per Cent;</hi> and <hi>that</hi> happen'd before the Emiſſion either of the <hi>middle</hi> or <hi>new</hi> Tenor Bills, and when no other Bills were current but thoſe of the <hi>old</hi> Tenor: And on the other Hand, for about five Years next after the Emiſſion of the <hi>middle</hi> Tenor Bills, the Price of Silver continu'd very near at a Stand—As to the Price of Proviſions; That muſt of Neceſſity follow the Riſe of the Price of Silver and all other Commodities in general; For otherwiſe how is it poſſible for the Huſbandman to ſubſiſt? The Riſe of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions does not indeed keep even Pace with that of the Price of Silver, which generally riſes by Starts, and then keeps at a Stand for ſome Time, but <hi>gradually</hi> as the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try man feels the Effects of the Riſe of Silver in the Prices of all other Commodities and Neceſſaries of Life, which he is oblig'd to purchaſe; And thus it happen'd that the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt

Extent of the Riſe of Proviſions, which neceſſarily follow'd the great Riſe of Silver and depreciating of the Bills between 1733 and 1735, did not diſcover itſelf 'till after the firſt Emiſſion of the <hi>middle</hi> Tenor Bills in 1736, and ſo what was really the Effect of the Riſe of the Price of Silver, (which neceſſarily depreciates the Bills of Credit, and by Degrees influences the Price of all other Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) is imputed by Miſtake to the different Denomination of the Bills of the <hi>middle</hi> Tenor and <hi>new</hi> Tenor from that of the <hi>old</hi> Bills; that is, to the mere Difference of Sound in the ſeveral Denominations; which is a groundleſs No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even tho' the Price of Proviſions ſold at Market had been uſually computed in Bills of the <hi>middle</hi> or <hi>new</hi> Tenor, but muſt entirely vaniſh, when it is conſider'd that the Price of 'em has been conſtantly computed in Bills of the <hi>old</hi> Tenor, ever ſince the Emiſſion of the <hi>middle</hi> and <hi>new</hi> Tenor Bills, juſt as it was before their Emiſſion, and with no more Regard to or Conſideration of either the <hi>middle</hi> or <hi>new</hi> Tenor Bills, than if they had never been emitted.</p>
            <p>And it may be further added as a ſtrong Reaſon for the <hi>Governour'</hi>s preferring Bills of this Denomination, that it is the moſt conformable to the Act of Parliament of the 6th of Queen ANEE, and her ſaid late Majeſty's Proclamation <hi>for aſcertaining the Value of foreign Coins;</hi> and to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's <hi>Inſtruction</hi> to his Governour, which ſtrictly enjoins him the Obſervation of that Act; and it ſeems rather to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd at that the Province Act made in 1740 for emitting <hi>l.</hi> 80,000 in Bills of the <hi>old</hi> Tenor was ever <hi>conſented</hi> to, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> had been brought to conform to the Act of Parliament and his Majeſty's Inſtruction for four Years, than that Emiſſions of Bills of the <hi>old</hi> Tenor ſhould be continu'd.</p>
            <p>In the ſame <hi>November</hi> Seſſion, a few Days after paſſing the beforemention'd Supply Bill, the Aſſembly paſs'd ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bill entitled an Act <hi>to aſcertain the Value of Money, and of the Bills of public Credit of this Province,</hi> &amp;c. Whereby among other Things it was provided, that if the

Bills <hi>then</hi> to be emitted, or other Bills <hi>thereafter</hi> to be made, ſhould be depreciated below the Value, at which the Bills then iſſued were emitted, or the Bills afterwards to be iſſued ſhould be emitted, in ſuch Caſe the <hi>Juſtices</hi> of the reſpective Courts of Judicature ſhould give Judgment for ſo much Silver, as the true Debt ſhould appear to be, and in want thereof for ſo much in ſaid Province Bills, with the Addition of ſo much more, as would make Amends for the depreciating of the Bills from the Value, at which they <hi>then</hi> were or ſhould be <hi>afterwards</hi> ſtated; and that there might be one certain uniform Rule, by which the ſeveral Courts ſhould proceed in making up their Judgments, it was <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided</hi> that the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> ſhould once in every ſix Months determine the Rates, that the ſaid Bills commonly paſs'd at in Proportion to Silver and Bills of Exchange payable in <hi>London;</hi> and upon <hi>their</hi> failing to do it, that a Committee of the Members of his Majeſty's Council ſhould do it; and in Caſe of <hi>their</hi> Failure, that the Juſtices of the Superior Court of Judicature, in their ſeveral Terms in the County of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> ſhould appoint five able and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Men to conſider and report the true Value of the Bills, as they would produce in Silver or Bills of Exchange to the beſt of their Judgment, &amp;<hi>c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the firſt Act of it's Kind, which was ever paſs'd in the Province, and being a new Thing and likely to prove unpopular in the Execution of it, neither the <hi>General Court</hi> nor the Members of his Majeſty's Council, nor the Judges of the Superior Court of Judicature, ſeem'd fond of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying it into Execution; which was omitted to be done 'till the <hi>Governour</hi> call'd upon the Judges by his Letter to 'em for that Purpoſe, at their <hi>February</hi> Term in 1742, to do it; and by his <hi>ſpecial Directions</hi> the Act was accordingly then carried into Execution by their appointing a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee to value the Bills, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> and ſo has continued to be done in the ſame Channel (which is the moſt proper one for it) according to the Amendments made by a ſubſequent Act paſs'd in 1743, and will no doubt continue to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</p>

               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:005302_0024_1016F94D5D1A3DB8"/>
The Effect of this Act, as it was paſs'd at firſt, was that the Debtor was obliged to pay the Creditor, over and above the nominal Sum of his Debt, ſo much as the Bills were depreciated from the Value, at which they were firſt emitted; which upon the Experience of it proved inconvenient and oppreſſive to the Debtor, by compelling him to pay the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor in the firſt and only Inſtance of it's having been then carried into Execution ſeven and an half <hi>per Cent.</hi> more than was his juſt Due; wherefore in <hi>May</hi> 1743 the <hi>Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> upon the <hi>Governour'</hi>s Meſſage to 'em recommending the following Amendment of it, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Creditor ſhould be allow'd only ſo much, as the Bills ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciated below the Value, which they were of at the Time of contracting the Debt, amended it accordingly: And thereby the true Point of Juſtice between the Debtor &amp; Creditor, which is that every Debtor ſhould pay, and every Creditor receive the full Value of his Debt, and no more, was eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd upon a firm Baſis, all poſſible Over-reaching or Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Debtor avoided, and the perpetual Execution of the Act well ſecur'd, which it would have been very difficult to have preſerv'd upon the Terms, in which the Act was fram'd at firſt.</p>
            <p>And this is all that the <hi>Governour</hi> could poſſibly do for preventing the miſchievous Effects of the Bills; and it is evident that this Proviſion in the Act would effectually ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to every Perſon the Value of that Part of his Eſtate, which is outſtanding in Debts, and be an adequate Remedy for the Chief Miſchiefs, that aroſe before from the depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating of the Bills, and check that litigious Spirit, which was grown to a conſiderable Head for want of ſuch an Act, if Creditors ſhall think fit to take the Benefit of it: In the Country they generally have; but in <hi>Boſton</hi> the Shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers, who have long taſted the Sweets of the deprecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Bills, are averſe to complying with it volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, and the Merchants their Creditors are tender of forcing 'em into it, by demanding an Allowance for the deprecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Bills in a Court of Law; and ſo it has had little or no Effect there; But all that <hi>Government</hi> can do, is to
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:005302_0025_1016F950375129D0"/>
provide the Remedy, and to put it into the <hi>Power</hi> of the Creditor to recover the full Value of his Debt.</p>
            <p>However this Act together with the Alteration made in the Fees of the Courts of Judicature in <hi>January</hi> 1741, by which they were rais'd to double what they were before the laſt Act <hi>for preventing the Oppreſſion of Debtors and making the Bills a Tender</hi> expir'd in <hi>November</hi> preceeding, ſeems to have had a very conſiderable Influence for retrenching the former exceſſive Number of Law Suits, which has by this Means been reduced near one Half, and in the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Court, with Reſpect to indiſputable Debts and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints</hi> upon <hi>Defaults,</hi> near two third Parts.</p>
            <p>At their <hi>May</hi> Seſſions in 1742 the General Court found that the late Settlement of the Boundary Line between this Province and <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> whereby ſome whole Towns, which were before tax'd towards the Support of the <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts</hi> Government, were now included within the Limits of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Government, and that other Towns un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame Situation were interſected by the Line, had made a new Valuation of the Eſtates of the ſeveral Towns throughout the Province neceſſary, before they could ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion the Taxes laid on that Year; and as the ſettling of a new Valuation Act is generally an Affair of ſome Length and Difficulty in the Houſe of Repreſentatives, and could not be compleated before the Governour's intended Interview with the Eaſtern Indians that Summer, that Affair and the Apportionment of the Taxes for that Year was put off 'till the next Meeting of the Court on the firſt of <hi>September,</hi> to which ſhort Day they were adjourn'd chiefly for that Purpoſe; But upon their Meeting then they could make ſo little Progreſs in it, before the Seaſon of the Year neceſſarily call'd the Country-Members Home, that they roſe again without compleating the new Valuation, but with a firm Reſolution to come fully prepared to go through the Valuation and Tax-Act by the End of <hi>November,</hi> to the 18th of which Month they were adjourn'd; But at their Meeting then alſo the Zeal of the ſeveral
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:005302_0026_1016F953607B2B98"/>
Repreſentatives for the Intereſt of their reſpective Towns ſo increas'd the Difficulties and Conteſts in ſettling the Valuation, that tho' the Committee for that Buſineſs attended it with the utmoſt Diligence and Aſſiduity, yet it was not finiſhed 'till <hi>January,</hi> and then the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly proceeded to make their Tax-Act for 1742, ſo that by this unforeſeen Accident the Apportionment of the Taxes for that Year was inevitably delay'd about five Months beyond the Time limited by the before-mention'd Act in 1741, and the Time for paying the Taxes into the Treaſury about three Months, it being impracticable for the Treaſurer by iſſuing his Warrant to cauſe that Tax to be aſſeſsed and levy'd according to the Proportion ſettled by the laſt preceeding Tax-Act, as the Province had been ſince the making of that Act diſmember'd of ſome Towns, which were included in that Tax, ſo that the ſame Appor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionment of the Taxes for the Year 1742 would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd a Deficiency in the levying of 'em; for which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon a new Apportionment was neceſſary to be made by the General Court; But at the next <hi>May</hi> Seſſion, the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> punctually apportion'd the Taxes for the Year 1743, ſo that they made two heavy Tax-Acts within the Space of five Months: Which fully ſhews that the Delay in the former Year was not in the leaſt affected, but proceeded intirely from the Difficulties, which the Houſe of Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives had in agreeing upon the new Valuation.</p>
            <p>In the Beginning of the <hi>November</hi> Seſſion following the <hi>Governour</hi> in his Speech reminded the Aſſembly of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, they were under to the Poſſeſſors of the <hi>middle</hi> Tenor Bills; and preſs'd them to make a proper Proviſion for anſwering their Demands, and order'd the Treaſurer to lay before them for that Purpoſe the State of the Treaſury; upon which it was diſcover'd that in Conſequence of the repeated Miſtakes, which I have before-mention'd, upwards of <hi>l.</hi> 42,000 in Bills of the <hi>middle</hi> Tenor had been hoarded up by ſome money'd Men and was outſtanding, and that there was no more than about <hi>l.</hi>2,900 in Silver and Gold in the Treaſury to redeem them.</p>

               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:005302_0027_1016F957AD241B48"/>
At this Time the <hi>middle</hi> Tenor Bills, which were current, paſs'd at 33 and a 3d <hi>per Cent</hi> leſs than the <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> Bills of the ſame Tenor and equal Denomination with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, tho' the <hi>middle</hi> Tenor Bills were within eight or nine Weeks of the Time limited for their Redemption, and the <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> Bills were not redeemable at all with Silver and Gold, and the Period for drawing <hi>them</hi> in was at 18 Years Diſtance; ſo that according to the common Rule of Diſcount the <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> Bills were of leſs Value than the <hi>middle</hi> Tenor Bills 60 <hi>per Cent</hi> at leaſt: This is a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative Proof of what little Expectation the People in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral had that the <hi>middle</hi> Tenor Bills would be exchang'd at the Treaſury, or rather of the general Perſuaſion, which prevail'd that the Poſſeſſors of thoſe Bills would have no Satisfaction from the <hi>Government;</hi> And indeed the Re-emiſſion of <hi>l.</hi>17,000 of theſe Bills in 1740, which were not intitled to be redeem'd at the Treaſury by the Stipulation of the <hi>Government,</hi> and their being ſo intermix'd with the redeemable Bills of the ſame Tenor, that the Redeemables could not be diſtinguiſh'd from the Non-redeemables, had in the Opinion of Perſons moſt judicious and knowing in the Temper of the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> laid ſuch an Obſtacle in the Way of the Redemption of any of the Bills, that very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no Succeſs was then expected from the Governour's Application to the <hi>Houſe of Repreſentatives<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

for a greater or leſs Sum; the Effect of which was that the <hi>middle</hi> Tenor Bills ſhould be receiv'din'all publick Payment, at near 34 <hi>per Cent.</hi> more than they had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd at before: But the Benefit of this Vote extending only to ſuch Poſſeſſors of the <hi>middle</hi> Tenor Bills, as had publick Payments to make, the <hi>Governour</hi> on the next Day of the Court's Sitting preſs'd the Houſe to provide for making Satisfaction to all the Poſſeſſors in general; and the <hi>Houſe</hi> immediately voted that the Treaſurer ſhould be directed to exchange to all Perſons whatſoever Province Bills of the laſt Emiſſion for Bills of the <hi>middle</hi> Tenor, <hi>that is to ſay,</hi> a <hi>twenty Shilling Bill</hi> of the <hi>laſt</hi> Emiſſion for a <hi>twenty Shilling Bill</hi> of the <hi>middle</hi> Tenor, and ſo <hi>pro ratâ:</hi> And an Act of the General Court was ſoon afterwards paſs'd for apportioning and aſſeſſing a Tax of <hi>l</hi> 8,000 in Bills of the Tenor and Form laſt emitted, to make good the Defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of the Funds of Taxes for drawing in the outſtanding Bills, which was occaſion'd by making this Satisfaction to the Poſſeſſors of the <hi>middle</hi> Tenor Bills.</p>
            <p>I find this is the firſt Inſtance of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment's making a Recompence to the Poſſeſſors of any of the Bills of Credit for their being depreciated below the Value, at which they were firſt emitted; and it prov'd in the Time of it's Tranſaction an exceeding critical Event, and was then eſteem'd no ſmall Point gain'd to have gone this Length towards procuring Juſtice for the Poſſeſſors of the Bills, and ſaving the Credit of the Province from the Danger, it was brought into of being irretrievably lost: For as to the Province's purchaſing a ſufficient Quantity of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Gold for exchanging the <hi>l.</hi>42,000 outſtanding Bills, it was not practicable, had the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> been diſpoſed to have done it, between the beginning of the <hi>November</hi> Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Time of the Redemption of the Bills; and the <hi>l.</hi>2,900 in the Treaſury, which would not have exceeded 9<hi>d.</hi> in the Pound when divided amongſt the Poſſeſſors of <hi>all</hi> the outſtanding Bills intitled to be exchanged by the before-mention'd Acts, was too trifling a Diſtribution to be thought of; ſo that Province Bills ſeem to be the only
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:005302_0029_1016F95C0B481F60"/>
Equivalent, that could be given in Exchange for the <hi>middle</hi> Tenor Bills by the Time limited for the Poſſeſſors of 'em to make their Demands; and <hi>that</hi> was given 'em according to the full Valuation of Silver in Bills of the laſt Emiſſion, as it was ſet by the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> in 1741 at the Time of the Emiſſion of the Bills, and ſince which the Price of Silver had not really riſen, tho' this Payment was in Fact 7 and an half <hi>per Cent.</hi> leſs in Value than the Houſe of Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives eſtimated it at, and than the real Price of Gold and Silver then was; But this Affair had ſo long labour'd in the <hi>Houſe of Repreſentatives,</hi> and it's Succeſs had proved ſo doubtful, that it was thought a Point of Prudence for the <hi>Governour</hi> to paſs the Order, and not to run the Riſque of loſing <hi>all</hi> by rejecting it, and committing the Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Matter a ſecond Time to the lower <hi>Houſe,</hi> whoſe Sentiments appear'd upon the tranſacting of this Affair not to be <hi>unalterably</hi> eſtabliſh'd for making <hi>any</hi> Allowance to the Poſſeſſors of the Bills.—And indeed when it is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd that the Poſſeſſors had receiv'd theſe Bills at their depreciated Value, and gain'd from the Province a Profit of 33 &amp; a third <hi>per Cent.</hi> for hoarding 'em up five or ſix Months, or perhaps ſome few of 'em a little longer; and that thoſe Bills of the <hi>middle</hi> Tenor, which were redeemable at the Treaſury, were ſo blended with the <hi>l.</hi>17,000 of 'em, which the <hi>Government</hi> had not ſtipulated to redeem, that none of the Poſſeſſors could be certain which of the two Sorts of Bills his were; and that in ſuch Caſe there was ſome Room for the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> to have diſputed the Redemption of the <hi>l.</hi>17,000, which had been once ſunk and re-emitted by <hi>Miſtake,</hi> and to have inſiſted that the Poſſeſſors (ſince it could not be determin'd which of 'em had the redeema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Bills and which the non-redeemable Ones) ſhould make an Allowance (upon an Average among 'em all) for the <hi>l.</hi>17,000 non-redeemable Bills, according to the ſeveral Quota's of Bills in each Man's Poſſeſſion; I ſay when theſe Circumſtances of the Bills are conſider'd, and that neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the <hi>Government</hi> ſubmitted to redeem <hi>all</hi> of 'em in the Manner, they have done, there ſeems to be no great Reaſon for the Poſſeſſors to impeach the juſtice of the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> in

this Particular, or to be diſſatisfy'd with the Terms, which were <hi>procur'd</hi> and <hi>conſented to</hi> for 'em. And indeed in the Time of the Tranſaction they appeared to be very well ſatisfy'd with it.</p>
            <p>Soon after the Alteration made by the late Act for <hi>aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Value of Money and Bills of Credit,</hi> &amp;c. in Favour of Creditors with Regard to <hi>future</hi> Debts, the Judges of the Superior Court and two or three of the Inferior Courts took Occaſion from thence to alter <hi>their</hi> Rules for chancering of Forfeitures upon <hi>old Bonds</hi> and Mortgages condition'd for the Payment of <hi>a Sum certain in Bills on this Province,</hi> or for the Payment of <hi>a Sum either in thoſe Bills or lawful Money;</hi> which gave Riſe to ſome Conteſts between the <hi>Houſe</hi> of Repreſentatives and the <hi>Council,</hi> and a general Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content of the Debtors, as well as many others throughout the Province.—Ever ſince the Publication of the Law <hi>for preventing the Oppreſſion of Debtors</hi> in 1712 'till that Time, all Debts due upon Bonds and Mortgages of the before-mention'd Tenor were underſtood and conſequently <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended</hi> both by the Creditor and Debtor, at the Time of contracting the ſame, to be payable in Bills of Credit on this Province, according to their <hi>nominal</hi> Value, whether ſuch Bills ſhould riſe or fall in their real Value, between the Time of contracting the Debts and the Payment of it; and the ſeveral Courts of Judicature had made the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of thoſe Bonds and Mortgages, and govern'd themſelves accordingly in entring up Judgments, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding Executions for ſuch Debts; and this general Underſtanding of the Rule of Law, and the uninterrupted Practice of the Courts of Judicature had influenc'd and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd Men in their Dealings, Contracts, Purchaſes &amp; Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of their Eſtates at their Death during the above-mention'd thirty Years: As to the Creditor, who plac'd out his Money at Intereſt, and conſequently choſe what Kind of Security his Debtor ſhould give him; if he made his Election to have his Debt aſcertain'd and not to ſtand the Chance of the Riſe or Fall of the Bills in their Value, he took his Bond or Mortgage with Condition for the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:005302_0031_1016F95F6E2B2338"/>
Payment of ſo many Ounces of Silver, or a Sum certain in Sterling Money, or in Proclamation Money <hi>only;</hi> If on the other Hand he had an Opinion, that the Bills of Credit were more likely to riſe than fall in their Value, he took a Bond or Mortgage with Condition for the Payment <hi>of Bills of Credit</hi> only, or for the Payment either <hi>of lawful Money or of Bills of Credit;</hi> and the Debtor (who is oblig'd to give ſuch Security as his Creditor inſiſts upon) under the Sanction of the ſettled Practice of all the Courts of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature upon ſuch Securities did not ſcruple to give his Bond or Mortgage condition'd <hi>for the Payment of Bills of Credit or of lawful Money,</hi> tho' the Money was at the Time of giving the Mortgage double, treble or four Times the Value of the Bills and Sum lent him; and in ſuch Caſe there never had been any Inſtance of more than the nominal Sum of the Bills expreſs'd in the Condition of the Bond or Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, and Intereſt due upon 'em in like Bills being ever paid, or demanded in a Court of Judicature 'till 1742, when the Judges of the Inferior Court for the County of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and of the Superiour Court of Judicature alter'd their <hi>eſtabliſh'd</hi> Rule of chancering ſuch Bonds and Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages, and made the ſame Allowance to the Creditor for the depreciating of the Bills in the Caſe of <hi>old</hi> Debts, as the before-mention'd late Law had provided ſhould be made with Reſpect to <hi>future</hi> Debts.</p>
            <p>Upon this Caſe I would obſerve, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That ſome of thoſe Creditors, who choſe to take the before-mention'd Security for their Debts, had a View of an exorbitant Gain in it ariſing from the general Perſuaſion, which prevail'd for a long Time, that by the Year 1741 all the <hi>old</hi> Bills would be drawn in; and that the reſt of the Creditors had at leaſt an Opinion that the Bills could not well fall lower, but were more likely to riſe than fall in their Value; and it ſeems not to be doubted, but that if the Bills had during this Courſe of Time ſometimes riſen as well as fall'n in their Value, and Creditors and Debtors had promiſcuouſly been ſometimes Gainers ſometimes Loſers by the before-mention'd Contracts, every Perſon would have thought it juſt that the
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:005302_0032_1016F96528B65148"/>
Gainers on both Sides ſhould have had the Benefit of their Contracts, ſo that all the Difficulty in the Caſe ariſes from the Loſs's having almoſt perpetually happen'd on one Side.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this Departure of the Courts of Judicature from their ſettled Practice was going contrary to the <hi>known Intent</hi> of the Parties at the Time of contracting the Debt, which is not only the principal Rule of Equity, as it is ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in the Engliſh Courts of Judicature, but likewiſe the general Rule of <hi>Juſtice</hi> univerſally eſtabliſh'd in all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, and governing themſelves by the accidental <hi>Event</hi> of the Contracts, which was novel and unſafe to be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into the Provincial Courts in <hi>any</hi> Inſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That this new Rule was alſo liable to great Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections on Account of it's being neceſſarily attended with Injuries and Wrongs in the following Caſes, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many Debtors, who under the Sanction of the late ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled <hi>Rule</hi> of Practice upon the Province Law, had accepted the Payment of Debts due to themſelves upon the like Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities in depreciated Bills of Credit, would by having the Rule <hi>ſhifted</hi> upon 'em be compell'd to pay their own Debts in Bills of an higher Value.</p>
            <p>And Perſons who had purchas'd Lands ſubject to old Mortgages before this late Alteration of the Practice of the Provincial Courts, and had only an Allowance made in the Purchaſe Money for thoſe Incumbrances according to the depreciated Value of the Bills, would be compell'd by the Mortgagees to pay for the Redemption of thoſe Lands more than what they were allow'd in the Purchaſe of 'em for the Incumbrances by the Mortgageors.</p>
            <p>And for theſe and other Miſchiefs too long to be enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated here, and which would befall other Perſons in the Community beſides Debtors, if this new Rule of Practice in the Courts of Judicature was to take Place in all Caſes, it was impoſſible for the Legiſlature to provide an adequate Remedy.</p>

               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That as many of the old Debts would be doubled, ſome trebled, and ſome few augmented almoſt fourfold by this new Rule of the Courts of Judicature, it ſeem'd unavoidable that ſome of the poorer Sort of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies in the Province would be wholly broke up and ruin'd by it; which Conſequences ſo alarm'd the <hi>Houſe of Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives,</hi> that upon the Petitions of two of the Debtors they paſs'd a Vote for nullifying theſe Judgments of Court; but they miſcarry'd in <hi>Council;</hi> And at the Cloſe of the Seſſion in <hi>April</hi> 1733 a Bill was unanimouſly paſs'd by the <hi>Houſe of Repreſentatives,</hi> and concurr'd by the <hi>Council,</hi> and lay'd before the <hi>Gonernour</hi> for his Conſent, the Purport of which was to declare by Way of Explanation of the ſeveral Acts for preventing the Oppreſſion of Debtors, that the before-mention'd Bonds and Mortgages were not <hi>Specialties</hi> within the Exception of thoſe Acts, according to the true Intent and Meaning of 'em <hi>at the Time of their being paſs'd:</hi> But I find by the Governour's Speeches upon this Occaſion, that tho' he was of Opinion that in the Beginning the Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor had the Rule of Law on their Side, yet he thought the Law had been ſo long <hi>otherwiſe</hi> underſtood, and practis'd upon by the Courts of Judicature, that the <hi>general Error</hi> in that Caſe had obtain'd the Force of Law, according to the receiv'd Maxim in the Courts of Law, <hi>Communis Error facit Jus:</hi> And as he was of Opinion that the Courts of Judicature's departing from their eſtabliſh'd Rule of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in this Caſe, and breaking thro' the <hi>real Intent</hi> of the Parties would be of miſchievous Conſequence to the Community, he join'd with the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> in recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to the Judges of the Superior Court of Judicature to re-conſider at their next Court the Judgments, which they had made up on old Bonds or Mortgages of the before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Tenor (which were only two in Number) and in their future chancering of <hi>old</hi> Bonds and Mortgages of that Tenor to obſerve the <hi>Intent</hi> of the Parties according to their former Rule of Conſtruction; and in the mean Time Execution was ſtay'd in thoſe two Caſes, one of which was of the Value of about <hi>l.</hi> 100, and the other of about <hi>l.</hi>3 10<hi>ſ.

ſuch Securities, to whom the General Court had given a juſt Expectation by their before-mention'd Act in 1736, that the outſtanding Bills of the old Tenor ſhould be exchang'd at the Treaſury in 1742 for Silver at the Rate of one Ounce of Silver for every <hi>twenty Shillings</hi> in Bills, whereby they might be induced to let their Bonds and Mortgages lie, depending upon the Bills in which they were payable being finally redeem'd in Silver at the above-mention'd Rate, he recommended it to the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> as a Point of Juſtice to make good to the Creditors the Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances given 'em in 1736, that the outſtanding Bills ſhould be of the aforeſaid Value in 1742; and this the <hi>Governour</hi> urg'd upon 'em in his ſecond Speech as what the publick Faith of the Province was pledg'd to thoſe Creditors for the Performance of by the Act in 1736, and other ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Acts paſs'd in 1737, 1738 and 1740, in all which the Value of the Bills of the old Tenor was ſtated as equal to Silver at <hi>twenty Shillings</hi> per Ounce both in publick and <hi>private</hi> Payments; and that the <hi>Government</hi> was bound to maintain 'em to be of the ſame Value in 1742, at which Time it had ſtipulated by thoſe ſeveral Acts that they ſhould be redeem'd at the aforeſaid Rate, and had actually begun to raiſe a Fund for that Purpoſe; and inſiſted that theſe Aſſurances from the Government amounted to a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty to the Poſſeſſor of the Bills, that they ſhould in 1742 be of the Value, at which they had been ſtated by the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Acts; and I might add to the <hi>Governour's</hi> Argument, <hi>eſpecially as they had been made a Tender in Law by the Act paſs'd in</hi> 1731: And his Excellency finally propos'd that the <hi>Government</hi> ſhould make Good to thoſe Creditors, who had receiv'd no Recompence of any Kind from their Debtors for the depreciating of the Bills, the Difference between the preſent depreciated Value of 'em, and the ſeveral Values, they were of when the reſpective Debts were contracted, not exceeding in ſuch Valuation of the Bills the Rate of <hi>twenty Shillings</hi> for one Ounce of Silver; and propos'd a Committee to be inſtantly rais'd for the Execution of that Affair.</p>

What Effect this Recommendation from the General Court to the Judges of the Superiour Court of Judicature will have, with reſpect to their Judgments in future Caſes of the ſame Kind, is not certain, ſuch Recommendation not being binding upon 'em; the two Caſes recommended to 'em for their Re-conſideration fail'd of obtaining it for want of being brought properly on before them at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Term; and upon the Debtor's petitioning the General Court to be reliev'd further, the Prayer of it was granted by the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> but was not <hi>conſented to</hi> by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour; and ſo the Creditor had his Execution upon the firſt Judgment: As to the ſeveral Judgments, which had been made up <hi>in the Inferior Courts</hi> upon Bonds or Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages of the ſame Tenor, and from which there was no Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the <hi>Superior Court of Judicature,</hi> the Recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the <hi>General Court</hi> did not reach to thoſe Caſes; and tho' one or two ſubſequent Petitions for Relief in 'em had been preferr'd to the <hi>General Court</hi> and ſucceeded in the <hi>Council</hi> and <hi>Houſe of Repreſentatives,</hi> yet as the Debtors had neglected to appeal and proſecute their Remedy at Law in the Superiour Court, and ſo had acquieſc'd in thoſe Judgments, the <hi>Governour</hi> refus'd his Aſſent to the Vote of the Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>And whatever Influence the <hi>Governour'</hi>s Determination in the Caſe conſider'd as it ſtood between the Creditors and the <hi>Government,</hi> which I find the <hi>Governour</hi> preſs'd the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of afterwards in a Meſſage and Speech to the <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> may have; or however this Affair may end, it ſeems upon the whole, that the Satisfaction propos'd by his <hi>Excellency</hi> for the Creditors is more plainly due to 'em from the <hi>Government</hi> than from the <hi>Debtors;</hi> is more ſafe and ſalutary for the Publick, and more conſiſtent with the Rule of Juſtice, than to exact it from the <hi>Debtors</hi> by a new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd Rule of Conſtruction by the Courts of Judicature, which is contradictory to the real Intent of the Parties in the before-mention'd Securities, as well as to the former ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled Rule of the Courts, which had led Debtors in to give ſuch Securities, and which by augmenting the Debts im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately

muſt neceſſarily diſtreſs many Families in the Province, eſpecially of the poor labouring Sort, and alſo work many Injuries and Wrongs contrary to the Maxim of Law, <hi>Lex non facit Injuriam:</hi> All which Conſiderations ſeem to be of no ſmall Weight in the Scale of Government.</p>
            <p>Upon the Inſpection of the State of the Treaſury, which had been laid before the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> in <hi>November</hi> 1742 by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the <hi>Governour,</hi> when the Redemption of the <hi>middle</hi> Tenor Bills was brought under Conſideration, the before-mention'd Arrear of Bills outſtanding beyond their ſtated Periods for want of Executions having been duly iſſued out againſt the deficient Collectors of the Taxes, purſuant to the Province-Law, was fully diſcover'd by the Governour: And upon the laſt burning of Bills in <hi>May</hi> 1743 it appear'd that 132, 394 <hi>l.</hi> 18<hi>ſ.</hi> 2<hi>d.</hi> of 'em had been drawn in and conſum'd, and that the remaining 258,468 <hi>l.</hi> 16<hi>ſ.</hi> 5<hi>d.</hi> was outſtanding; whereupon the Treaſurer was order'd forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to iſſue out Executions againſt the deficient Collectors of the Taxes in general throughout the Province to compel 'em to bring in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he Remainder; whereby the whole 390,863<hi>l.</hi> 14<hi>ſ.</hi> 7<hi>d.</hi> may be expected to be drawn in by <hi>May</hi> 1744.</p>
            <p>This I find is the firſt Inſtance of iſſuing out Executions in general in ſuch Caſe; Executions had been before iſſued in particular Caſes, where Collectors were in Arrear and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of Inſolvency; but they had never been iſſued out againſt all the deficient Collectors in general, and merely for the Sake of drawing the Bills into the Treaſury, tho' his Majeſty's two before-mention'd 16th and 18th Inſtructions ſeem very explicit, and to have been <hi>expreſly</hi> fram'd for that Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The Payment of this large Arrear muſt, it is evident, be as much felt by the People as if it had been a new Tax, and more burthenſome to 'em than if the ſeveral Parts of it had been collected, when they firſt became due; and
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:005302_0037_1016F9738B682698"/>
this happen'd too at a Time, when the Circumſtances and extraordinary Charges of the Government requir'd higher Taxes to be laid upon the ſucceeding Years, than had been uſually rais'd within theſe laſt twenty-five Years; yet the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> has granted 'em with the utmoſt Unanimity, and the People have cheerfully born 'em; and if the publick Charges ſhould not be increas'd by a <hi>French</hi> War, as there is no Reaſon to doubt but that the preſent <hi>Governour</hi> will direct the ſame Method of drawing in the Bills by general Executions againſt all deficient Collectors of Taxes to be purſu'd, and the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> will continue to raiſe equal Taxes with thoſe, they have granted ſince the Year 1740, whilſt the Exigencies of the Government require it, the current Quantity of the <hi>Maſſachuſett</hi> Bills will be reduc'd within <hi>l.</hi>30,000 <hi>Sterling</hi> by the End of the Year 1746, and not one Bill of that Government will be extant, except what is iſſued for the Service of the current Year to be drawn in the ſame or next ſucceeding Year at fartheſt, by the End of the Year 1753; and in the mean Time the Quantity of Bills current at one and the ſame Time will be annually leſſening, ſo that there is now a fair Proſpect of ſome End of thoſe Grievances, which, inſtead of being diminiſh'd, have increas'd more ſince the Arrival of his Majeſty's two before-mention'd Inſtructions, which the late <hi>Governour</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the Aſſembly, till the Year 1741, than they ever did within the ſame Compaſs of Time before.</p>
            <p>And this is the utmoſt, that can be done by the <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts</hi> Government either for Remedying the miſchievous Conſequences of the depreciating of the Bills, under which Creditors had ſuffer'd for theſe laſt thirty Years, and the Community in general had been much hurt, or to prevent the <hi>depreciating</hi> itſelf, which indeed would be plucking the Evil up by the Roots.—As to the firſt, the putting it into the Power of the Creditor to demand and have of his Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor a full Allowance for the depreciating of the Bills be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Time of the contracting and Payment of the Debt, which <hi>the Act for aſcertaining the Value of Money,</hi> &amp;c. has done, is (with reſpect to Debts owing within the

Province) an adequate Remedy for the malignant Effects, tho' not all the Inconveniences of the depreciating of the Bills, whenever the Creditor ſhall think fit to take the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Act; but to cure the depreciating itſelf intirely is not in the Power of this <hi>Government;</hi> For tho' I find that the depreciating of the Bills has been generally impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to immoderate Quantities of 'em having been current at one and the ſame Time, and their long Periods, as the only Cauſes of it, yet I think it is evident that it is <hi>primarily</hi> owing to this ſingle Circumſtance of the Trade of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. <hi>viz.</hi> That the Quantity of Silver and Gold and Bills of Exchange to be purchaſed within it, and in one or other of which the Ballance of Trade between the Province and <hi>Great Britain</hi> (which is ever greatly in Favour of the latter) muſt neceſſarily be paid from Time to Time, is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to anſwer the Demands for 'em for that Purpoſe, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd by the Shortneſs of the Province's other Returns to <hi>Great-Britain;</hi> in which Caſe the Price of Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change and of Silver and Gold in <hi>Bills of Credit,</hi> with which only they are to be purchas'd, like that of all other Commodities, which are much in Demand and very ſcarce at Market, is neceſſarily rais'd by Means of the Buyers outbidding each other; and as <hi>ſuch</hi> Demands for Silver and Gold and Bills of Exchange for paying the Ballance of Trade due to <hi>Great Britain</hi> frequently recurs more or leſs in the Province, the Price of 'em will upon every Occaſion riſe in Proportion to thoſe Demands without any fix'd Bounds, or (to ſpeak more properly) the Bills of Credit will more and more depreciate; on the other Hand when the Quantity of Silver and Gold, and Bills of Exchange to be bought at Market is ſufficient to anſwer every Purchaſer's Occaſions, it is Manifeſt that the Price of 'em will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue at a Stand, let the Quantity of the current Bills of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit be what it will, becauſe the only Reaſon which can be aſſign'd for any general Merchandize or Commodity's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing in it's Price (except in the Caſe of a Monopoly or ſome unlawful Combination) is the Scarcity of it, which induces the Purchaſers to raiſe the Price of it by outbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding each other, eſpecially if ſome of 'em are under a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:005302_0039_1016F97981438C20"/>
of buying it at any Rate, which is the Caſe of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Purchaſers of Gold or Silver or Bills of Exchange in the Povince for Returns to <hi>Great Britain:</hi> Further, if even the Ballance of Trade againſt the Province ſhould increaſe in any Year, when there happen'd an Increaſe of the Paper Currency, yet if there ſhould alſo happen to be an Increaſe of the Quantity of Silver and Bills of Exchange in the ſame Year ſufficient to pay that Ballance, it's plain that the Price of Silver and Bills of Exchange would not be rais'd that Year even by the joint Increaſe of the Ballance of Trade, and of the Quantity of the Bills of Credit: And on the contrary if the Ballance of Trade ſhould happen to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in any Year, when there ſhould happen to be a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe likewiſe of the Paper Currency, yet if there ſhould happen to be a leſs Quantity of Silver and Gold and Bills of Exchange in the ſame Year, than what will ſatisfy <hi>that</hi> Ballance, it is evident that the Buyers, who are in want of it to make Returns to <hi>Great Britain,</hi> will outbid each other for 'em, and ſo the Price of Silver and Exchange will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily riſe that Year; or (to ſpeak more properly) the Bills of Credit will depreciate, notwithſtanding the Decreaſe of the Ballance of Trade and of their own Quantity; ſo that if theſe Obſervations are juſt, it is evident that the Riſe or Fall of the Price of Silver and Gold and Bills of Exchange, in which conſiſts wholly the riſing or deprecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Bills of Credit, does not <hi>primarily</hi> depend upon the Increaſe or Decreaſe of the Quantity of the Paper Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, but ſingly upon the Proportion, which the Quantity of Silver and Gold and Bills of Exchange to be bought at Market bears to the Demands which there are for 'em, to make Returns to <hi>Great Britain;</hi> and that the Increaſe or Decreaſe of the Quantity of Bills of Credit can't affect the Price of Silver and Gold and Bills of Exchange any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than as it checks o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

If indeed an Increaſe of the Bills of Credit ſets in at the ſame Time with an Increaſe of the Ballance of Trade, and a Decreaſe of the Quantity of Silver and Gold, and Bills of Exchange in the Province, the Increaſe of the Paper Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency at ſuch a Conjuncture will contribute exceedingly to raiſe the Price of Silver and depreciate the Bills of Credit: Thus in the Year 1734, when the Act of Parliament for laying the preſent Duty upon the Importation of foreign Melaſſes firſt took Place, which abridg'd the Trade of the Province in one of its moſt conſiderable Branches for a ſhort Time, and there happen'd alſo ſome Failure of its Cod and Whale Fiſhery, both which occaſion'd a great Deficiency in its Returns that Year, and there was the uſual Importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Goods, and no Increaſe of the Silver and Gold generally imported into the Province, and of the Bills of Exchange to be purchas'd there, and about the ſame Time there happen'd a large Increaſe of the Paper Currency by a new Emiſſion of <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> Bills and a Scheme of Notes commonly call'd <hi>Merchant'</hi>s Notes, this Conjunction of Circumſtances caus'd Silver to riſe from <hi>twenty Shillings,</hi> to <hi>twenty ſeven Shillings and ſix Pence</hi> per Ounce, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Bills of Credit to depreciate above one third Part of their former Value; in which immoderate Fall of 'em the great Increaſe of their Quantity had no ſmall Share as a <hi>ſecondary</hi> Cauſe; But during the five next ſucceeding Years the Price of Silver and Exchange, and the Value of the Bills kept nearly at a Stand; not becauſe the Quantity of the Paper Currency was diminiſhed; For on the contrary it greatly increas'd within that Time; But as the immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate depreciating of the Bills had occaſion'd exceſſive Loſſes to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Merchants upon their outſtanding Debts in this Province, it very much diſcourag'd and leſſen'd the Importation of Engliſh Goods in the five next ſucceeding Years, and the Province by Degrees ſoon retriev'd it's Melaſſes Trade, and the like Failure of their other Branches of Trade did not happen, ſo that by Means of leſſening the Importation of Goods from <hi>England</hi> and of the Increaſe of the Quantity of their Returns, the Ballance of Trade in Favour of <hi>Great Britain</hi> was ſo much diminiſh'd that the
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:005302_0041_1016F97F2655B498"/>
Demands for Silver, and Gold, and Bills of Exchange to diſcharge it did not exceed the Quantity, which was to be had of 'em in the Province within thoſe five Years, and ſo their Price kept very near at a Stand, and conſequently the Bills of Credit depreciated very little within that Time.</p>
            <p>I ſhall illuſtrate this Obſervation with one Fact more: I find that in the Year 1712 there was current in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince 179038<hi>l.</hi> 15<hi>ſ.</hi> 9<hi>d.</hi> in Bills of the <hi>old</hi> Tenor, which then were equivalent to 716153<hi>l.</hi> 3<hi>ſ.</hi> 0<hi>d.</hi> in Bills of the ſame Tenor and Denomination, according to their preſent depreciated Value, which Sum exceeds the Quantity of all the Bills of Credit now current in the Province; and yet the Bills of Credit continu'd at <hi>Par</hi> with Silver till the Year 1713, and were not in the leaſt depreciated by their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate Quantity, tho' <hi>l.</hi>88,000 of it, which was then equal to <hi>l.</hi>352,000 was emitted within the Year 1711, and the Bulk of the Remainder was all iſſued in the Compaſs of a few Years before; which ſeems to be a full Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the depreciating of the Bills from 40 to 495 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Advance, (the middle Price of Exchange at this Day) is not <hi>primarily</hi> owing to the immoderate Quantity of the Emiſſions of the Paper Currency in the ſubſequent Years; tho' I doubt not but it has frequently contributed towards it at ſuch particular Conjunctures, as I have before mention'd.—The true Account of the Matter is this; The Trade of the Province had till this Time been in very flouriſhing Circumſtances; the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay</hi> formerly ſupply'd not only the reſt of <hi>New-England,</hi> but the Colonies of <hi>New-York,</hi> the <hi>Jerſeys, Pennſylvania,</hi> and other Parts of the Continent, even as far as <hi>South-Carolina,</hi> with the chief Part of their <hi>Engliſh</hi> and other <hi>European</hi> Goods, and carry'd on a very large Cod-Fiſhery at <hi>Canſo,</hi> and a conſiderable Whale-Fiſhery in it's own Bay, ſupply'd the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Weſt-Indies wholly with Lumber and live Stock, and <hi>Jamaica</hi> and <hi>Barbadoes</hi> with great Part of their Wines from <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deira</hi> and the <hi>Cape de Verd</hi> Iſlands, drove a large Trade to the <hi>Bay of Honduras, Surinam, Newfoundland, Holland,</hi> the <hi>Streights</hi> and the <hi>Mediterranean;</hi> by all which it was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd

with a Variety of Returns to <hi>England</hi> beſides Silver and Gold and Bills of Exchange in great Abundance; and with theſe Advantages it had a Silver Currency of it's own Coinage; But as it wholly loſt ſome of theſe Branches of Trade, and others in Part, the Cod Fiſhery in particular by the Encroachments of the <hi>French</hi> upon the <hi>Canſo</hi> Fiſhery; and the Trade of <hi>Newfoundland</hi> by their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments on the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Fiſhery; and their Whale Fiſhery was much decay'd by the Whales being beat off the fiſhing Ground 'till the laſt Year, when they in ſome Meaſure return'd into the Bay; The Ballance of Trade with <hi>Great-Britain</hi> has by Degrees not only drain'd the Province entirely of it's Gold and Silver Currency, ſo that thoſe Species are become a mere Merchandize, but has of late Years conſtantly exceeded the Quantity of Gold and Silver imported from Time to Time into the Province from the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and the Bills of Exchange to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd within it ſo much, that by raiſing the Price of 'em from Time to Time it has depreciated the Bills of Credit by Degrees to their preſent fall'n Value.</p>
            <p>The preceeding Account of the Difference between the nominal Sum and real Value of the Bills of Credit cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in this Province in 1712, and the nominal Sum and Value of Bills now current will furniſh us with the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Obſervations. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That tho' the nominal Sum of the Bills of Credit now current in the Province, computed in Bills of the ſame Tenor and Denomination with thoſe which were current in the Year 1712, vaſtly exceeds the nominal Sum of the Bills then current, yet their <hi>real</hi> Value or Quantity is much leſs than that of the Bills, which were current in that Year, ſo that the immoderate Emiſſions of Bills ſince that Time, inſtead of increaſing, have much diminiſh'd the <hi>Medium</hi> of Trade; which is one very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Miſchief of the exceſſive Quantity of 'em. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it is impoſſible abſolutely to fix the Value of the Bills of Credit under the preſent Circumſtances of the Trade of this Province, and that the utmoſt, which can be done for the Creditor, is to ſecure to him the Value of his

outſtanding Debts againſt the depreciaring of the Bills. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That this demonſtrates how unfit Bills of public Credit are to ſerve as a <hi>Medium</hi> of Trade in <hi>New-England,</hi> and the great Wiſdom of His MAJESTY's Royal Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Governours of his two Provinces there reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'em to Emiſſion of Bills for the neceſſary Support of his Government only, and to a limited Sum of 'em even for that Purpoſe. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That notwithſtanding his Majeſty's two Provinces of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay</hi> and <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> are by Virture of his Royal Inſtructions to the reſpective Governours of 'em limited in their Emiſſions of Bills of public Credit, as to the Sums allow'd to be current at one and the ſame Time, and ſuch Sums to be only for the neceſſary Support of his Majeſty's Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment within thoſe Provinces, yet as the Bills of public Credit emitted by the two Colonies there will always from the Circumſtances of the Trade between them, and the Province of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay,</hi> obtain a general Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency within that Province (notwithſtanding the utmoſt Endeavours of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> Government to prevent it) and the two Colonies are at Liberty to emit ſuch Quantities of Bills upon <hi>Loan,</hi> as are not only ſufficient to ſupply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with a Medium of Trade within their own Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but alſo with a ſurplus Stock to purchaſe whatever Merchandizes they want from the Province of the <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts-Bay,</hi> or to lend any Sums to the Inhabitants of that Province upon perſonal or real Security, the Inhabitants of the four Governments in <hi>New-England</hi> conſider'd collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively will be at Liberty to ſupply themſelves with what Quantity of <hi>Paper Medium</hi> they pleaſe, notwithſtanding the Reſtrictions laid on the particular Governments of the two Provinces; for tho' neither the Province of the <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts-Bay</hi> nor of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> ſhould be permitted to iſſue out one Bill, yet they would be ſupply'd with what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Sums they deſired from the Colony of <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> in particular, five Sixths of whoſe Bills, to the amount of at leaſt <hi>l.</hi>350,000 old Tenor, are already circulating within the Province of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay;</hi> and His Majeſty's Inſtructions to his Governours of his two Provinces, tho'
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:005302_0044_1016F985435410E8"/>
the moſt exact Obedience ſhould be paid to 'em, would wholly loſe their intended Effect as to remedying the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs ariſing to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Merchants in particular from an unlimited Paper Currency in <hi>New-England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I think, Sir, upon the whole, that were the ſame Regulations of the Paper Currency to be extended to the two Governments of <hi>Connecticut</hi> and <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> as I have before-mention'd to have been made in this Province; and thoſe two Colonies were to be limited in their Emiſſions of Bills with Reſpect to the Sums allow'd to be current at one and the ſame Time within each of 'em, in which Caſe I ſhall ſuppoſe the whole Sum allow'd among all the four Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments would not exceed the Value of <hi>l.</hi>60,000 Sterling at the moſt, and thoſe Sums to be reſtrain'd to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Support of his Majeſty's Government, and ſecur'd to be drawn in by Funds of Taxes equal to the Sums emit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in the ſame or next ſucceeding Year at furtheſt, and the Bills of all the four Governments to have the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of being receiv'd at their reſpective Treaſuries at 5 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Advance, it would go far towards reſtoring a Silver and Gold Currency, (the only proper Medium of Trade) in <hi>New-England,</hi> would prevent in a great Meaſure, tho' not abſolutely, the depreciating itſelf of the Bills of Credit, and bid fair for curing all their <hi>miſchievous</hi> Effects.</p>
            <p>Since I began this Letter the <hi>Governour</hi> made a Speech to the Aſſembly on the 9th Inſtant upon the Subject of the Bills of Credit of the Colonies of <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> &amp; <hi>Connecticut,</hi> ſetting forth the pernicious Effects of 'em with Regard to this Province, which as it ſeems to have had a remarkable Influence upon the Members of the Aſſembly and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in general, I ſhall here tranſcribe: <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen of the Council and Houſe of Repreſentatives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE chief Occaſion of my calling you together at this Time is to lay before you, for your Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, the State of the Province with Reſpect to the
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:005302_0045_1016F98AC84F5D78"/>
Bills of Credit on the neighbouring Governments:—Of theſe there may be reckon'd to be now current among us the Sum of <hi>l.</hi>400,000 computed in Bills of the old Tenor, <hi>viz. l.</hi>350,000 of it in Bills of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony of <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> and <hi>l.</hi>50,000 in thoſe of the Colony of <hi>Connecticut:</hi> Upon this Sum the Inhabitants of this Province have by the general depreciating of the Bills from <hi>l.</hi>450 to 485<hi>per Cent</hi> Advance, which ſeems to be the middle Price of the preſent Exchange, loſt within theſe nine Months <hi>l.</hi>25,000 old Tenor, which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the two Colonies have gain'd (ſome ſmall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction for the Bills of this Government, which may be current within the Colonies, only excepted)—And on looking back to the Year 1734, in which the Bills of Credit depreciated a third Part of their whole Value, I find that the Province then loſt upon <hi>l.</hi>320,000 of the Bills of thoſe two Colonies, which may be computed to have been at that Time current in it, upwards of <hi>l.</hi>106,000 old Tenor, (ſuch Deduction as I have before-mention'd only excepted)—and whoever would make a minute Calculation of the Loſſes ſuſtain'd by this Province from Time to Time upon the ſeveral Depreciations of the Bills of the two before-mention'd Governments current among us, will, I doubt not, find 'em amount to <hi>l.</hi>180,000 old Tenor at leaſt: This of it ſelf would be a grievous Loſs to the Community, was it to ſtop here; but as we may very reaſonably expect further large Emiſſions of theſe Bills, and (if we may judge by our preſent Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe already extant, what our Share of their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Emiſſions will be) that five ſixths of the <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> Bills, and more than half of thoſe of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> or at leaſt ſome other large Proportion of 'em will cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in this Province; and that under the preſent Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of our Trade, and of the Bills of theſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, the depreciating of the Bills in general will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to be unavoidable, how inſupportable to this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity muſt it's growing Loſs be?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="unknown:005302_0046_1016F98C4C82ED38"/>
The Loſs already ſuſtain'd by it's Inhabitants, like other general Loſſes of a Community, may not have been ſufficiently regarded by 'em, eſpecially as the Bills of this Government have depreciated <hi>pari paſſu</hi> with the Bills of the Colonies, and all of 'em have had a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous Currency among us, ſo that the Loſs ariſing upon the Bills of the Colonies have not been ſeparated and diſtinguiſh'd from that, which ariſes upon the Bills' in general; but it is evident that every Perſon muſt ſhare in it more or leſs, and the <hi>Debtors,</hi> who are ſubject by the late Province Law to make an Allowance to their Creditors for the depreciating of the Bills, muſt feel it in a particular Manner.</p>
            <p>I have hitherto, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> only obſerv'd to you the Loſs ariſing to the Province by the depreciating of the Bills of the two Colonies in our Hands, which muſt be ſuſtain'd, tho' the Bills ſhould be finally redeem'd from the Poſſeſſors: But what juſt Grounds have we to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any ſuch Expectations? Or with what are they to be redeem'd? The preſent Emiſſions of the <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> Government may be reckon'd to amount in the whole to about <hi>l.</hi>440,000, <hi>l.</hi>70,000 of which appears to be ſufficient for the Medium of their own Trade, and to defray the Charges of their Government: The <hi>l.</hi>350,000 current in this Province is a ſurplus Stock, with which the Inhabitants of the Colony have purchas'd <hi>European</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities from the Merchants &amp; Traders of this Province: Is there any Proſpect of finding Vent for this immoderate Sum by the Purchaſe of any Merchandizes within their Colony? This can't be expected 'till the whole Trade of this Province ſhall be transferr'd to them; and it may be a Queſtion whether even Part of that would be eaſily accepted by 'em; for it is certainly more eligible for 'em to purchaſe <hi>Britiſh</hi> Manufactures in <hi>Boſton</hi> with their Colony Bills, than to remit their own Subſtance for 'em to <hi>Great-Britain:</hi> I will ſuppoſe, and doubt not but that the Government of <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> will call upon the Borrowers of theſe Bills to diſcharge their Bonds,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:005302_0047_1016F991D4E73240"/>
when their diſtant Periods ſhall arrive; but can we rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably depend upon their compelling their own Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants to redeem the Bills outſtanding in this Province with their <hi>Houſes,</hi> or <hi>Lands,</hi> or any other Part of their <hi>Eſtates?</hi> May they not rather aſſiſt 'em with further Emiſſions of Bills to enable 'em to pay off their old Debts to the <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> Government: And will not the Conſequence of that be to augment the Quantity of their Colony Bills, which the Inhabitants of this Province have already current among 'em, in ſo exceſſive a Degree as that the Province muſt at laſt ſink under the Loſs ariſing to it by 'em: The Circulation of the Bills among our ſelves may poſſiby hide the pernicious Effects of 'em to the Province for ſome Time; But can it be reaſonably thought that a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of Bills without any Proſpect of their Redemption by the Government that emitted 'em, and with very little other Value to this Province at the bottom, than what they receive by the Circulation it ſelf in the Province, ſhould not fail in a few Years; and what a Scene of Diſtreſs and Ruin that would produce in the Province I need not tell you.</p>
            <p>Theſe, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> are Matters, that demand your cloſeſt Attention, and the moſt ſpeedy Redreſs: What will it avail the Province for this Government to take due Care of the Regulation of it's own Bills, if it muſt ſtill be expoſed to be ruin'd by the immoderate Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of the Bills of it's Neighbours, emitted for no other viſible Purpoſe, than to be ſunk in this Province; whereby they have it in their Power to become Maſters of whatever Share of our Subſtance and our Trade they ſhall be pleas'd to take in exchange for their Bills.</p>
            <p>As to the proper Method for procuring the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Bills of theſe two Government already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced among us, or preventing the Introduction of more of 'em into the Province, I ſhould be glad if I could ſuggeſt to you any Thing, which it may be in the Power of this Government to do further than what they
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:005302_0048_1016F994ABE69620"/>
have already done: In 1738 an Act with a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Penalty in it was paſs'd for preventing the Bills of any of the neighbouring Governments, which had been emitted ſince the firſt Day of <hi>May</hi> in the ſame Year, or ſhould afterwards be emitted, from being utter'd in this Province, unleſs they were made redeemable by lawful Money upon good Security within ten Years after their firſt Emiſſion, and it ſhould ſo appear by the Tenor and upon the Face of the Bills: But this you are ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> had not any Effect to check the Currency of 'em among us before <hi>September</hi> laſt, when a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was iſſued with the Advice and Conſent of his Majeſty's Council to inforce the Obſervation of it upon all His Majeſty's Subjects within this Province in general, and the civil Officers within it in particular: This I hope may have had it's proper Effect upon the Officers, but doubt much whether it has had any upon others: And in <hi>June</hi> laſt a Committee was appointed by the General Court on Behalf of this Province to treat with ſuch other Gentlemen, as might be appointed by the three neighbouring Governments on their Parts, in order to project ſome Meaſures for preventing the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther depreciating of the Bills of Credit of the reſpective Governments, or otherwiſe to conſider of ſome Method for bringing 'em to a Period in ſuch Manner, as ſhould be juſt and equal, and moſt for the Intereſt of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of theſe Governments: And I am informed by Mr. Secretary that he ſent Letters of Advice concerning this Matter to the ſeveral neighbouring Governments, deſiring their Concurrence in theſe Meaſures, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having receiv'd any Anſwer from 'em.—If any Thing can be ſtill further done for remedying theſe Miſchiefs by this Government, I ſhall readily concur with you in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whatever ſome Perſons may perſwade themſelves, it is certainly an Error to think that any of His Majeſty's Colonies have the Privilege conferr'd upon 'em by
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:005302_0049_1016F99630918C48"/>
               <hi>Charter</hi> to make Money; Coinage is an undoubted Part of the Royal Prerogative, and the Practice of ſtriking Bills of publick Credit to paſs in Lieu of Money ſtands ſolely upon the Royal Indulgence, and is warrantable no further than it is neceſſary for the Support of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Government within the Colony or Province, that uſes it: The Bills of this Government, which have been iſſued within theſe laſt ten Years, ſtand indeed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a different Foundation from that of the Bills of the two beforemention'd Colonies: They have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
