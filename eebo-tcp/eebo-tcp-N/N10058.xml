            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <hi>Dear</hi> HAYTON,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OU cannot be ignorant that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, tho' awakening Information given me of the the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by an Engliſh ſlave under capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, to our bigotted Mehometan neighbour, <hi>Abdala,</hi> put me upon a reſtleſs deſire of a farther knowlege therein. This, I was convinced, could not be obtained in my preſent unhappy ſituation; being in a country, where it is death to give the leaſt ſuſpicion of favoring the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian profeſſion; where every eye, and every ear were dangerous watchers over all my behaviour: Therefore it was, with all the caution ceceſſary to ſo hazardous an attempt, I happily got on board the <hi>Expedition,</hi> bound from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I came to <hi>England,</hi> as ſoon as I had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of making my obſervations, I found that the Chriſtian religion was in general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed thro'out this kingdom. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the purity it enjoins, it appeared that the generality of its profeſſors were very looſe in their morals, profane in their diſcourſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched in their lives. I alſo found that the profeſſors of Chriſtianity were divided into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny religious ſects, and, what is much to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:012778_0003_0F8A932A519CB290"/>each carry their oppoſition, for the moſt part againſt the other to that height of invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, as if they worſhipped not the ſame GOD.</p>
            <p>This put me upon farther enquiry into the principles of the Chriſtian Religion; a taſk difficult enough for a ſtranger to undertake, who had then but a ſmall acquaintance with the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> tongue. But that impediment was remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a ſhorter time than was expected, by the aſſiſtance of a humane, ſober Gentleman, whoſe profeſſion was to teach the languages, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct his pupils in the religion of his country. He took much pains in teaching me both; and furniſhed me with ſuch books as were neceſſary, particularly that which they call the <hi>Bible,</hi> which is to Chriſtians what the <hi>Alcoran</hi> is to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans. This is their perfect rule of faith, and contains a full declaration of the will of GOD, with a full account of future rewards and puniſhments for the good and evil.</p>
            <p>As I read theſe ſacred pages with an unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced mind, and a deſire of information, I ſoon found how miſtaken I had been concerning the terms of man's acceptance with GOD, and of his final ſalvation; namely, that it is <hi>not by works of righteouſneſs which we had done, but according to his mercy he ſaved us, by the waſhing of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and that <hi>by grace we are ſaved, through faith, and that not of ourſelves, it</hi> [even faith] <hi>is the gift of God.</hi> I clearly ſaw, according to this book, <hi>That to him that could not work,</hi> previous to his juſtification, <hi>but believeth on Jeſus Chriſt, his righteouſneſs,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received by faith, <hi>is imputed to him for juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:012778_0004_0F8A932BEA979468"/>I ſaw alſo both the nature and extent of the moral Law; the fall of man by the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of <hi>Adam,</hi> our general root and repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative; that the firſt covenant being broken, man was utterly unable to obtain ſalvation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; and that Jeſus Chriſt, the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> came into the world to be the ſaviour and living head of all that believe in him: For them he fulfilled the law; for them he ſatisfied divine juſtice; and that the only way to eternal life, was, by receiving his righteouſneſs, which is imputed to all them that believe.</p>
            <p>When I began to underſtand ſomething of the differences amongſt the various profeſſors of Chriſtianity, I found them all remote from the tenor of ſcripture; that all within the circle of my acquaintance, ſeemed totally to neglect thoſe doctrines the holy ſcriptures made abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to ſalvation, and warmly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for <hi>forms</hi> and <hi>modes,</hi> and whatever the Bible was either quite ſilent about, or laid no ſtreſs upon. But what I wondered at moſt of all was, that thoſe who are called Clergymen, and are by the laws of their country, ſeparated from the reſt of the people, to teach the principles and practice of their holy religion, are, for the moſt part, the greateſt ſtrangers to the eſſence of the Goſpel. As for their lives, they are as vain, trifling and irreligious as any others. They frequent all public theatres, balls, and the vileſt aſſemblies; in ſhort, they are a common reproach, a public ſcandal, and the very hindrance of others repentance, but ſtill they call themſelves the Miniſters of the Goſpel, the Ambaſſadors of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012778_0005_0F8A932CA8F1FAB8"/>Chriſt; and expect to be reverenced of all men, for being the followers of his humility, his contempt of the world, and purity of life.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, I could form no other judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the divinity of the goſpel from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment of the bulk of its profeſſors, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of their teachers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than that it was a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning fable, deviſed only to aggrandize a ſet of men that call <hi>themſelves</hi> the <hi>Clergy.</hi> Their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic exhortations faintly recommend a conduct of life, ſuch as they themſelves are moſtly ſtrangers to; though it be no more than a little dry <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ity: From all this I could ſee them in no other light, than tho very enemies to the croſs of Chriſt, the greateſt oppoſers of the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and deceivers of the people.</p>
            <p>Thus, my dear <hi>Hayton,</hi> inſtead of the real happineſs I promiſed myſelf in the ſociety of Chriſtians, and the glorious privileges of their religion, ſo recommended and adorned by that poor exiled ſlave, I met with very little elſe here in this Chriſtian land (ſo called) but infidelity and profaneſs; which ſore diſappointment har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened my heart againſt all religion whatever. What could I then conclude, but that the <hi>Bible</hi> was a cheat, and their religion a craft? And I had well nigh reſolved to looſe the reins of my paſſion, and follow the multitude to do evil.</p>
            <p>But one <hi>Sabbath</hi> evening (and let me not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get that day!) as I was taking a ſolitary walk, muſing on theſe things, I paſſed by a very crou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded aſſembly of people. Led, as I thought, by curioſity, I entered the place with no little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt in my heart. But, O my <hi>Hayton!</hi> how
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012778_0006_0F8A932E85578208"/>ſhall I deſcribe the ſtrange emotions I felt, whilſt joy ſat upon the countenances of thoſe about me. The ſolemnity of the place, and the awful behaviour of the aſſembly was ſuch as I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeen before; and what ſtruck me with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and deep attention, one ſpirit ſeemed to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the whole body; and what one man offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in prayer, the reſt made their joint requeſt to GOD for.</p>
            <p>O what I felt when I heard the KING of Kings addreſſed in theſe words! <hi>Gird thy ſword upon thy thigh, O thou moſt mighty, and in thy majeſty ride proſperouſly upon the word of truth, meekneſs and righteouſneſs—Thine arrows are very ſharp in the heart of the King's enemies.</hi> I trembled; and though I doubted if I had not better fly away, I could not. I dared not leave the awful place. Prayer being ended, from the ſacred ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles the man of GOD read theſe words, <hi>Except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the kingdom of God.</hi> He ſhewed both the holineſs of that GOD with whom we have to do; the great <hi>deſign</hi> of redemption by Jeſus Chriſt; the depravity of our ſouls, and the nature of that happineſs which is ſet before us; the abſolute neceſſity of being born again, in order to obtain a preſent pardon, and perſevere to future ſalvation. He not only proved the neceſſity of our regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from theſe, and many other ſubſtantial argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but there was ſomething like a judgment ſeat ſet up in my own conſcience. I was by ſome power, more than human, indicted, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned, proved guilty, and condemned. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> actions of my life were now laid open be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012778_0007_0F8A932EC73415F0"/>me; I was compelled to aſſent to what I never knew before, namely, that all my ſinful actions proceeded from a corrupt fountain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a nature univerſally depraved and polluted. Each ſentence he ſpake, came with authority and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction to my heart; eſpecially ſuch as theſe; <hi>Every mouth muſt be ſtopped, and all the world</hi> (even they that have not the written law) <hi>become guilty before God No man can redeem his brother, nor give unto God a ranſom for him. He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall be ſaved; and he that believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi> Now it was that my heart failed within me! I groaned in ſpirit. I cried, I am undone! My ſins are gone over my head. The remembrance of them is griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and the burden of them is intolerable.</p>
            <p>When all was ended, I ſtrove with all my might to conceal the confuſion of my mind from thoſe happier ſouls I was ſurrounded with; but ſome of them perceived my concern; and one ſaid to me, with tears in his eyes, "The Saviour of ſinners have mercy on thee, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal himſelf to thy ſoul! But, O, my load was great! I returned with a heavy heart.</p>
            <p>When I entered my cloſet, I threw myſelf proſtaate on the ground, and attempted to pray. But it was long before I could ſpeak a word. At length, under ſome heart meltings, and in broken accents, I cried out, <q>O Lord GOD; the maker of all things, and the governor of the world, unto thee all power belongs; thou canſt kill, and make alive—mercifully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a poor, miſerable ſinner—ruined and undone—I confeſs, O GOD, that I have
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012778_0008_0F8A9331642F0020"/>juſtly deſerved eternal death; and it is alone of thy ſparing hand that I am yet alive.— Thou canſt, in a moment, cruſh me to death, and in juſt vengeance deſtroy me forever— But, O my GOD, glorify thyſelf in the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion even of ſuch a wretch as I am!—O be merciful to me a ſinner!—For the ſake of all thy goodneſs, and all that whereby thou makeſt it known! Turn me, even <hi>me,</hi> and ſave me forever and ever!</q>
            </p>
            <p>After ſome time I roſe from the ground; but in great diſtraction of mind. Sometimes I had thoughts of going in ſearch of the preacher, in hopes of finding relief from him; but this ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed impracticable, it being now late in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and beſides I knew not where to ſeek him. Then I condemned myſelf for not having enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red where he lived, and looked upon this neglect as a bad omen. It now darted into my mind, whether or no the miniſter I had heard was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally a man of like paſſions with others, or rather an angel ſent from GOD. In the multitude of my thoughts within me, I caſt my eye upon my quite neglected <hi>Bible,</hi> which I had before care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly thrown aſide, finding it ſo little regarded by the generality of thoſe called Chriſtians. I read, and pondered, and read on; but alas! every line ſeemed to militate againſt me; and inſtead of miniſtring relief, to encreaſe my tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I cloſed the book, and pauſed, then opened it again, and found theſe words. <hi>The ſorrows of death compaſſed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me; I found trouble and ſorrow. Then called I upon the name of the Lord; O Lord, I
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012778_0009_0F8A93333211F670"/>beſeech thee, deliver my ſoul.</hi> This ſcripture, for a moment, conveyed ſome light and comfort to me in my diſtreſs. I ſaw my caſe was not, as I ſuppoſed, peculiar to myſelf. I ſaid, ſurely this man has been in like trouble of ſoul, and has felt the pains of hell too; and yet the Lord gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly delivered him out of all.</p>
            <p>But this ſmall glimmering of light was ſoon extinguiſhed: All that night I had no reſt. My ſlumberings were attended with aſtoniſhing terror—Death, judgment, and eternal deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was all I could ſee, and all I could hear; and a terrible ſound it was. The preacher's text was continually ringing in my ears, <hi>Except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the kingdom of heaven.</hi> For ſome time I confined myſelf to my room; hardly took ſo much ſuſtenance as was ſufficient to preſerve me alive. The comforts of this life were now blaſted. Hay under ſharp convictions. <hi>The arrows of the Almighty ſtuck faſt in me; they drank up my ſpirits, whilſt his hand preſſed me ſore:</hi> Then cried I, <hi>What muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> At other times I was more eaſy; then again under amazing horror and dread, becauſe I was ſo thoughtleſs and ſtupid, while my caſe was ſo dreadful. I was often under violent temptations to deſtroy myſelf, and ſo put an end to a wretched life; for I thought, ſurely the longer I live, the more ſin I commit; conſequently my puniſhment muſt be greater in the end. Then was I without hope of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and concluded, the ſooner I put an end to my miſery the better. Now and then I had a ſmall tranſient gleam of light darting into my
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012778_0010_0F8A9333591A77C8"/>ſoul, which, for the time it laſted, gave me ſome hope of deliverance; at leaſt a peradventure that the Lord might have mercy on ſo vile a wretch as me.</p>
            <p>At this ſeaſon I was led to diſcover more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſecret workings of corruption in my heart. The Spirit of God convinced me, that my underſtanding was by nature blind and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, <hi>'till God, who cauſed the light to ſhine out of darkneſs, ſhines into the heart, to give the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of his glory in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> I ſaw more than ever, that my will was ſtubborn and perverſe, even to an enmity againſt the law of GOD; alſo that my affections were all diſorderly, impure, ſenſual, and deviliſh; and what was even beyond this, that I could not love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who had done and ſuffered ſo much on my account. I felt that all my deſigns wholly terminated in myſelf. I was ſpiritually and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally convinced, that for me to deny natural, moral, and religious <hi>Self,</hi> and come to Chriſt as a poor, miſerable, wretched, empty creature to live upon his righteouſneſs forever, as my <hi>Bible</hi> directed me, is as ſupernatural and wonderful as to ſee the mountains and hills removed, and caſt into the depth of the ſea. I now began to feel more than ever what I had before read in the <hi>Bible,</hi> but could not comprehend—that ſalvation was entirely of <hi>grace</hi>—that nothing leſs than ſovereign grace could ſave my ſoul from the guilt and dominion of ſin, and make me a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the glorious privileges of the ſons of GOD.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:012778_0011_0F8A933499C16A10"/>
During this confinement, my courteous friend, who before had taken ſuch pains to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct me in the manners and language of the country, made me a viſit. He was greatly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed to ſee my countenance ſo fallen, and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enquired into the cauſe. As he was called a <hi>Teacher in Iſrael,</hi> and one that I had often heard animadvert warmly on the bad behaviour of the generality of his brethren; I ſimply related the trouble I was in, and what I apprehended was the cauſe of it, and what I more than feared muſt be the fatal conſequence. He looked earneſtly at me, and with concern in his countenance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <q>I pity your condition from my heart. Your diſorder is a religious diſtraction of mind, which we call <hi>enthuſiaſm,</hi> we have a great deal of this in <hi>England</hi> The perſon you heard preach, and who was the cauſe of your trouble, is a <hi>grand Deceiver,</hi> one whoſe conſtant employment is to <hi>turn the world upſide down!</hi> Not being content with the happy eſtabliſhed form of religion, he has got ſome novel wild chimeras in his head; and being fired with the irrational ideas of his own brain, he frightens his poor deluded followers out of their ſenſes; moſt of whom are poor illiterate perſons, the <hi>very filth and off ſcouring of the world.</hi> My advice to you, Sir, ſaid he, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to go near them more by any means. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the regular ſtated ſervice of our excellent church: go abroad into chearful company; ſhake off that coroſive melancholy, and reſume your wonted ſprightlineſs. God is a merciful Being, and does not require ſo much ſtrictneſs
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:012778_0012_0F8A9334CFBEC6E8"/>at our hands. You may uſe the pleaſures of this life, love the world, and go to heaven too</q>
            </p>
            <p>I aſked him the meaning of thoſe words. <hi>Except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</hi> He ſaid. <q>You muſt be baptiſed, and lead a moral, ſober life; but not think to receive the Holy Spirit.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now I ſaw what he was; and knew that if he was <hi>right</hi> the word of God was <hi>wrong;</hi> if the word of God was <hi>truth,</hi> he muſt be in <hi>error</hi> and <hi>deluſion.</hi> He left me grievouſly oppreſſed and heavy laden with ſin. I was under the cleareſt conviction, both from what the preacher decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and what I read in the Bible, that no righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs could ſerve to juſtify my perſon at the tribunal of a juſt and holy God, but that which is altogether perfect, fully commenſurate to the utmoſt Demands of the moral Law. This I more than ſaw was altogether impoſſible for me to perform In fine, I found my acquaintance was a phyſician of no value, altogether a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to my diſorder, and quite unacquainted with the only ſovereign remedy for periſhing ſouls: juſt then came into my mind ſome paſſages I had read in my Bible of falſe prophets, who cry <hi>Peace, peace, when there is no peace;</hi> and the bleſſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of Chriſtianity's words. <hi>Beware of falſe prophets, who are only blind leaders of the blind;</hi> I was enabled to take theſe hints, and to beware of falling into the ditch with him.</p>
            <p>I lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ed exceedingly for the return of the next Lord's Day; reſolved to go, (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the Doctor ſaid) to the ſame place,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:012778_0013_0F8A93358E6C71A0"/>where God had ſo wonderfully wrought upon my ſoul before.</p>
            <p>The bleſſed morning being come, I worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the God of heaven in fervent prayer, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted my body, ſoul and concerns to him, and begged that this day might be a feaſt of marrow and fat things to my ſoul; and ſoon haſted to the aſſembly of ſaints. And as they began their worſhip ſooner than moſt others, I was again a little too late. The ſame miniſter was there, and my very heart leaped at the ſound of his voice. He was juſt taking theſe ſoul-reviving words for the ſubject of his diſcourſe—<hi>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> He told us, that this was the voice of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, inviting weary, hungry, periſhing ſouls, to a feaſt of mercy and grace. And in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon his hearers to accept the invitation, he ſhewed, 1 That the burden of ſin is a heavy burden. 2. That the Spirit of God always makes us feel that burden, and groan to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, before we find reſt. 3. That Jeſus Chriſt only can give reſt to the weary ſoul. 4. That he will do it to all that come unto him; namely, to all that believe. He inſiſted upon all theſe points, and was large in the inferences he drew from them. Then concluded in prayer and praiſe.</p>
            <p>During the whole time, the moſt devout af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections were to be diſcerned in the whole aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly. As for me, I found that every word was exactly levelled at my heart. He could not have ſpoke more pertinently to my caſe, if
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012778_0014_0F8A93366CD5EBA8"/>I had told him all the exerciſes of my diſtracted mind. I ſometimes thought he had ſurely been informed of all my griefs, and hence he direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his diſcourſe <hi>only to me.</hi> He opened all my diſeaſe, probed the wound to the bottom; and it was as though I was ſhaken over the mouth of hell. Then he applied the precious <hi>balm of Gilead,</hi> he preached Jeſus Chriſt in all his offices, eſpecially as the glorious Phyſician, who heals the wounded conſcience, for his own name's ſake.</p>
            <p>In the application of the whole, he ſhewed the many hindrances which lie in the way; and the perplexing doubts and ſlaviſh fears which poſſeſs the burdened conſcience at its firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt; and withal, how able and willing he is to receive and give them reſt. My ſoul failed within me. My ſpirits ſunk under the weight of a comfortable hope, that Jeſus would have mercy on <hi>me,</hi> even <hi>me!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Juſt as he drew to a concluſion, he raiſed his voice, and with great earneſtneſs quoted theſe words; <hi>I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for mine own ſake, and will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thy ſins, ſaith the Lord.</hi> The bleſſed Spirit applied them home to my ſoul, and wrote them, by the finger of God, upon the Table of my heart; in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, the ſcales fell from my eyes! I beheld <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth</hi> by the eye of faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as evidently crucified before me—bearing my ſins in his own body on the accurſed tree. The priſon doors were thrown open; my ſoul, that was before bound in miſery and iron, and locked it in the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012778_0015_0F8A933707024FC0"/>priſon of unbelief, was now ſet at liberty, God helped me to come as a poor periſhing, undone ſinner, and caſt my ſoul upon Jeſus Chriſt! O he graciouſly received me; and according to the multitude of his mercies, and the faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his promiſe, he <hi>blotted out all my ſins!</hi> I received Chriſt into my heart, <hi>the hope of glory;</hi> and he put a new ſong in my mouth even praiſes unto God for his <hi>diſcriminating grace!</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>—He hath lov'd me, I cry'd,</l>
               <l>He hath liv'd and hath dy'd</l>
               <l>To redeem ſuch a rebel as me!</l>
            </q>
            <p>O my dear <hi>Hayton,</hi> I cannot deſcribe the thouſandth part of that tranſport of joy, that ſubſtantial bliſs I then felt; and bleſſed be God, <hi>even now,</hi> while I am writing. I yet feel it in my ſoul; I was in a moment tranſlated from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to light; from ſickneſs to health; from pain to eaſe; from miſery to happineſs; from bondage to liberty; from death to life: Yea, I may truly ſay, from hell to heaven!</p>
            <p>Had I but one wiſh left, it ſhould be, that my dear friend, even while he reads the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of my happy ſoul, <hi>might taſte and ſee how good and gracious the Lord is!</hi> might himſelf feel the ſweetneſs, life and power of Chriſt!</p>
            <p>Well, my ſoul is concerned for, and, I truſt, I ſhall always remember <hi>thee.</hi> my <hi>Hayton!</hi> and when I bow before the throne of Jeſus, O let my prayers come up before him, and be heard for you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:012778_0016_0F8A933833860488"/>
Now I begun to live. From this moment commenced my <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>eternal</hi> life, <hi>which is hid with Chriſt in God.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is become to me a head of influence, and I daily <hi>receive out of his fulneſs grace for grace</hi> The whole body of ſin is condemned in the flaſh, and has already received its mortal wound. Jeſus gave me to drink of the living water, and it ſlows, and ever will flow unto eternal life. The ſun of righteouſneſs ſhines with a new light into my <hi>underſtanding,</hi> ſets a new byaſs to my <hi>will,</hi> and all the <hi>paſſions</hi> and <hi>affections</hi> of my ſoul run in a <hi>new channel.</hi> In a word, the Holy Ghoſt has wrought a real, thorough change in my heart; all old things are done away, and all things are become NEW: for being now become dead to the law, and married to Chriſt, I am enabled to bring <hi>forth fruits unto God</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But O! when I view my intereſt in CHRIST, and conſider what an inexhauſtible fund of <hi>grace, ſtrength,</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> is ledged for me in the Redeemer's hands; this proves the ſweeteſt and moſt powerful engagement to all evangelical obedience, and the only ſpring of all true conſolation.</p>
            <p>May the dear IMMANUEL draw thy heart into union with his glorious perſon, which is eternal life! Then, and not till then, you ſhall enjoy a kingdom of heaven in your own breaſt, a very paradiſe in your ſoul, unſpeakably better than what the <hi>Alchoran</hi> deludes us with a falſe expectation of.</p>
            <p>If it be ſo, my dear <hi>Hayton,</hi> as it really is, that all real Chriſtians are thus happy in a world
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012778_0017_0F8A933A0C8E2838"/>of woe, and under the incumbrances of fleſh and blood; how tranſcendantly glorious, how unſpeakably happy muſt they be, when theſe impediments are removed! when the ſoul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes at liberty to range the whole paradiſe of GOD and taſte the joys of infinite delights!— And thus ſhall it be done unto every man whom Jeſus delights to honor.</p>
            <p>I muſt farther relate to you, that when I had the happineſs of being acquainted with the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> that firſt brought the glad tidings to my ears, and by whoſe miniſtry the grace of GOD reached my heart, I related my experience to him, and a few of his intimate friends. O how did they weep for joy over me! They ſtrengthened my faith in Chriſt, and gave glory to GOD, who had added another loſt ſinner to his militant church. Theſe knew how to ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathize with me, when I lay under the <hi>wrath of God,</hi> the curſes of the <hi>law,</hi> and the <hi>terrors of conſcience;</hi> for by comparing <hi>notes,</hi> our expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences exactly tallied, as <hi>face anſwereth face in a glaſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here give me leave to make a few obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of another kind.</p>
            <p>The Chriſtian religion is. I preſume, not only to be demonſtrated by the Spirit's ſecret opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the ſoul, but it may be proved from rational grounds, to be a ſyſtem altogether agreeable to <hi>right reaſon,</hi> and the moral <hi>fitneſs of things.</hi> For what ſo fit <hi>for,</hi> and ſuitable <hi>to</hi> a loſt, ungodly, helpleſs ſinner, as an all ſufficient SAVIOUR! What ſo ſuitable to the weary, as reſt; to the hungry, as bread; to the thirſty, as
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012778_0018_0F8A933ACDBDE9F0"/>water; to the naked, as a garment; to the blind, as ſight, &amp;c. All theſe, and many more ſtriking metaphors, has the Holy Spirit moſt elegantly, borrowed from the creature, to ſhew how rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable a thing it is that we ſhould believe on the LORD JESUS CHRIST unto eternal life.</p>
            <p>No man can be forced to believe againſt his reaſon, or love againſt his will, or deſire againſt his inclination. Therefore the Spirit of GOD firſt enlightens the underſtanding that it may <hi>diſcern;</hi> the <hi>will</hi> and <hi>offections</hi> then naturally flow after. The ſoul is firſt drawn to JESUS as if it would not come; and then it comes as if it were not drawn. <hi>He drew me with the cords of love, as with the bands of a man. And this is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation.</hi> (even of our enlightened age;) <hi>That Chriſt Jeſus came into the world to ſave ſinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I found that the greateſt part of thoſe, whom I have been ſpeaking of, could each ſay for himſelf, from the real experience of the heart, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt hath loved me, and given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for me.</hi> And the whole of their deportment and converſation in the world, ſhews them to be perſons full of genuine humility, unaffected ſeriouſneſs, being mild and gentle; free from all ſelfiſh deſign; wholly devoted to JESUS CHRIST, and earneſtly ſeeking the good of all their fellow creatures; and yet (wonderful to relate!) theſe people are contemned by almoſt all profeſſors, both teachers and hearers; yea, they are perſecuted, and loaded with all the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012778_0019_0F8A933CA8FF0A78"/>obloquy that inveterate malice can ſuggeſt; and all the oppoſition that can be contrived to prevent the ſpreading of the glorious goſpel, and the increaſe of the genuine followers of the exalted Redeemer Nay, theſe that diſagree in all other religious points, yet are unanimous in this that they will root one, if poſſible, their memorial from the face of the earth.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding all the oppoſition they meet with, the meekneſs, patience, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of theſe Chriſtians, both miniſters and people (for I underſtand there are many more of the ſame ſpirit) ſurmounts all difficulties, and their numbers daily increaſe. And why not? ſeeing the wonderful converſions that are among them, are ſurely enough to engage the greateſt ſceptic in religion, to believe that the mighty power of GOD is with them!</p>
            <p>O that our countrymen would but admit this true goſpel of Chriſt amongſt them! Surely if it were preached by ſome of theſe deſpiſed meſſengers of the living GOD, they would, I doubt not, thro' <hi>divine grace,</hi> embrace the truth as it is in Jeſus; and be a reproach to this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who reſiſt the calls of God: And though they are called by his name, will not have this man, this God man Chriſt Jeſus, to reign over them.</p>
            <p>Oh! how fatally ſucceſsful has the enemy of mankind been, by engaging in his intereſt that very power, which by primitive goſpel inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was ordained as a barrier between the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and his ſubtil inventions: Surely he has gained his point, by bribing the <hi>watchmen</hi> with
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:012778_0020_0F8A933D0359B250"/>riches, power, and pleaſure; ſo that while they riot in luxurious eaſe, the poor ſouls under their miſtaken care, fall an eaſy, willing ſacrifice to his rapacious power. Woe, woe to the <hi>watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> and woe to the <hi>people!</hi> for the careleſſneſs of <hi>thoſe</hi> will not extenuate the guilt of <hi>theſe. If the blind lead the blind, both ſhall fall in the ditch together.</hi> But every ſoul ſhall be required at the watchman's hand.</p>
            <p>It appears to me, that this <hi>corrupt miniſtry</hi> is a greater enemy to their nation than the moſt formidable powers about them; for <hi>thoſe,</hi> at the worſt, can but annoy them in their temporal intereſt, but <hi>theſe</hi> wound them deeply in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and eternal at the ſame time; inaſmuch as if we practiſed the goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, and lived by the faith of the Son of GOD, it could not fail of engaging the arm of Omnipotence in the defence of both: Then, having our anchor within the veil, we might juſtly triumph with thoſe worthy heroes of old, who, thro' <hi>faith, ſubdued kingdoms, wrought righteouſneſs, obtained promiſes, ſtopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, eſcaped the edge of the ſword; out of weakneſs were made ſtrong, waxed valiant in fight, and turned to ſlight the army of the aliens.</hi> Whereas, on the contrary, a diſſolute debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, prophase life, a land full of infidelity, muſt cauſe the divine Majeſty of heaven to riſe up againſt them.</p>
            <p>I ſhould ſwell my letter to too great a length, ſhould I purſue my inclination on this ſubject: But what I have ſaid, I hope, through the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of divine grace, will excite your deſires and
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:012778_0021_0F8A933E8BFFF5E0"/>diligence to become acquainted, <hi>experimentally acquainted,</hi> with the doctrines of the goſpel.</p>
            <p>Oh <hi>Hayton!</hi> did you but know the joy of believing in JESUS CHRIST, and the heaven I enjoy in communion with him, it would ſoon wean you from your ſuperſtitious and fruitleſs pilgrimage to <hi>Mecca</hi> and <hi>Ara<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>If it pleaſe the REDEEMER to breathe on theſe lines, this humble attempt to inform your judgment, and awaken your conſcience, ſo that they are brought with conviction to your heart, I ſhall, (if the LORD pleaſe) ſend you another letter, to give you a brief account of the doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines, practiſe, and diſcipline; the officers, members, glory and ſymetry of a church of CHRIST, according to the Bible plan.</p>
