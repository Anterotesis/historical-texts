            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Estate they were Glorious Creatures <hi>Sons of God, and Morning Stars.</hi> How great must that Evil be, which can turn an Angel into a Devil? Sin has done this, and that as to millions of them. There are more Devils then there are men in in the World; since there is no man, but there are Devils to Tempt him unto sin; and we read in the Gospel of thousands of Devils possessing one miserable man. It is Sin that has made so many Devils. Man was a glorious Creature before he was a Sinner. The most glorious Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that ever was made, next to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. Psal. 8.5. <hi>thou hast made him a little lower than the Angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour</hi>; but Sin has made him the worst Creature on the Earth. It has made him to be worse, nay, to be more irrational than the beasts that perish. How often are Sinners charged with act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more unreasonably than the beasts do. Isa. 1.3. <hi>The Ox knows his Owner, and the Ass his Masters Crib, but Israel doth not know, my people doth not understand.</hi> Alas! they were worse then bruits, who will pay some acknowledgment to their Fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

is poysonful and hurtful to him; yet thus irrational are men. Altho' they are told, and cannot but know that Sin is deadly poyson, and that if they commit such Sins, their Souls must dy for it; for all that they will venture. Sin has made men to be thus unreasonable. Nor is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Creature on earth an enemy to God, but only man, and Sin has made him so. It is Sin that has made this World to be an <hi>Evil</hi> World. Gal. 1.4. <hi>This present evil world.</hi> Had it not been for Sin, this World had never been an Evil One. It has brought a Curse and Misery on the <hi>Creation,</hi> so that the whole Creation sighs under it, and groans to be delivered from that corruption, bondage, vanity and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery which the sin of men has caused it to become subject unto. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.22. There had never been any other Evil, if it had not been for Sin. No man would ever have known by an experience of it, what Evil meant. Hence the forbidden Tree was called <hi>the Tree of knowledge of good and evil.</hi> Gen. 2.17. Men should have had an experimental knowledge of Good only, and not of Evil, if they had not sinned, Sin then is the greatest evil. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Lev. 26.15. <hi>If ye shall despise my Statutes.</hi> Sinners cast away the Law of the Lord of Hosts, and despise the Word of the Holy One of <hi>Israel.</hi> Isa. 5.24. A Sinner is a practical Blasphemer; he saith of the Law of God, that it is no good Law; that it is a Law not worth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding.

Sin is Rebellion against the Lord. Hos. 13.16 <hi>Samaria has rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her God.</hi> Sinners make an Insurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction against Heaven.

Sin is a dishonour to his Name. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.23. <hi>By breaking the Law thou dishonourest God.</hi> Some sins especially cast horrible contempt on the Glorious Name of God. Sins against knowledge (which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calls <hi>presumptuous Sins</hi> do so. Numb. 15.30. <hi>The Soul that does ought presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously reproacheth the Lord,</hi> as if he were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an Ignorant or an Impotent God: As if he either did not know that such an affront was offered to his Name, or had not power to revenge it.

Ezek. 8.12. <hi>They say the Lord sees us not, the Lord has forsaken the earth.</hi> There are Sinners, that if they thought a man, nay, a child of seven years old, that could tell of it, saw them, they would not commit that sin.

We must not suppose that they did in words thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press themselves, but this was the language of their sinful practices. They lived as if they had been really of that opinion, as if they thought they could be too hard for the Almighty. Sin calls the Truth of God into Question God says, If thou dost transgress my Law, <hi>ye shall surely dy for it</hi>: But Sin and the Devil says, it may be not for all that. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.8.

So far as a man is a <hi>Sinner,</hi> he is an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theist.</hi> Psal. 14 1. <hi>The fool has said in his heart that there is no God.</hi> It is hardly pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for a man with a rational soul really to believe that there is no God; but the fool wisheth there were none. And he does not believe that there is such a God as indeed there is. He is ready to think that God is altogether such another as himself, which is to Ungod him. He says in his heart, that God is not so Holy a God as his Ministers and as his Word declareth him to be, which is in effect to say, that He is no God: For if He should be less holy then He is, He should cease to be God. Holiness is called the Life of God. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.18. Wherefore Sin which strikes at the Life of God, is the highest Treason. And is it then to be made light of? By what has been said, it is manifest, that Sin is highly displeasing to the Lord; and the Lord himself has in more ways then one made it known, that Sin does provoke the Eyes of his Glory.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold yet further the severity of God. He has sometimes punished seemingly little sins after a dreadful manner, that men might see how their sins displease him, and that they might tremble to sin against him. When <hi>Nabad and Abihu</hi> instead of taking fire from the Altar according to Divine Institution, would follow their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and make use of another fire, without any warning given to them to repent of their sin, God killed them in a moment; there went out fire from the Lord and devoured them, and they dyed.

When the men of <hi>Bethshemesh</hi> looked into the Ark, probably with no ill design, only to see whether the <hi>Philistans</hi> had not taken some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out of it, <hi>the Lord smote of the people, fifty thousand and threescore and ten men.</hi> I Sam. 6.19. some have wondred how that could be, because <hi>Bethshemesh</hi> was a small Town, not containing fifty thousand, nor so many as five thousand; but as 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable the people round about the Country hearing that the Ark was come to <hi>Bethshe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesh,</hi> came flocking thither, and did ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverently look upon it, (which they might not do) and some would be look-into it; and for this error, above fifty thousand, not of the men of <hi>Bethshemesh</hi> only, but <hi>of the people,</hi> lost their lives.

Christ the Son of God became Sub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ject to it, because of our Sins, that he might deliver us from the Curse. What terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things did Christ suffer for our sakes? Never man did, nor could suffer so much as He the blessed Son of God endured on our account. Isa. 52.14. <hi>His visage was so marred more than any man and his form more thaen the sons of men.</hi> His Holy Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy endured most exquisite pain and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. 1 Pet. 2.24. <hi>Who his own self bore our sius in his own Body on the Tree.</hi> When he was Crucified, his holy hands and feet had nails driven through them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereby he was fastned to the Cross, because our works and walkings had been evil in the sight of God. Those sinewy parts, the hands and feet cannot be pierced through without inexpressible pain. In this mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry did the Son of God hang on the Cross for six hours one after another, that so we for our sins might not be hung up in Everlasting Chains of misery as we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.

therefore in an Agony in the Garden, and sweat great drops of blood, and prayed with strong cries and tears, that if it were possible that Cup might pass from him. Can we think that the Son of God would have been in such an Agony, if he had been to suffer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a bodily death? Would the thoughts of that have put him into a bloody Sweat! Shall we imagine that he had less courage in him then some of the Martyrs! But if Christ endured all this for our sins, shall we make a light matter of Sins. The consideration of what Christ suffered for our Sins, should make us afraid of the least Sin, and not to make a light matter of any Sin: No not of idle words. No man ever spoke an idle word in his life, but either Christ dyed to obtain the pardon of it; or, he that has been guilty of it, must dy for ever for it. Nor was there ever a sinful, no nor so much as a vain thought in the heart, but if Christ the Son of God had not dyed to obtain the forgiveness of that thought of thy heart, thou must have lain under the Curse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other transgressions, vile breaches of the Seventh Commandment are so. The man that shall be proved guilty of them, hath lost his good name for ever.

So on the Old World, when the Windows from on High were opened, and God poured down the Cataracts of his Wrath on a sinful sinning World: How many milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were swept away with that Beesom of Destruction? Sin caused all the men, and women, and Children in the whole World to be drowned in one year, excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting eight persons only. What a fearful day did Sin bring upon <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi> when all the people in those Cities were destroyed in one moment? It was Sin that provoked the Lord to rain down fire and brimstone, and an horrible Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest upon them. In our days, yea not five years ago, we have heard of Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes that have swallowed up whole Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties at once, and no less then an hundred and forty thousand Souls then perished.

far more dreadful than any Temporal Ones. As the Soul is far more worth than the Body, so Spiritual Judgments which lite on the Souls of men, are more to be trembled at, than those which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the outward man only. These are the woful fruit of Sin. The Loss of the Divine Image is a Spiritual Judgment. Sin has brought that misery upon every man in the world. Rom. 3.23. <hi>All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.</hi> There was in man before he sinned, knowledge and wisdom, which made him resemble God, but sin has taken from him that glory. But the Image of God in man did chiefly consist in that Holiness where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with his Soul was beautified.

Hardness of heart is a Spiritual Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: None of the ten plagues of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah</hi> were so dreadful as that; but it is sin that hardens the hearts of men. Heb. 3.13. <hi>Take heed lest your hearts be hardned through the deceitfulness of Sin.</hi> There are some, that there was a time when if they had committed such a Sin, Hell would have been in their Consciences for it, but now they can do it, and laugh and make a mock at what they have done. Thus are they smitten with Judicial Hardness of heart. The Lord never punisheth sin more fearfully then when he punisheth Sin with Sin. It may be a Sinner has been guilty of the sin of Uncleanness. God to punish for it, leaveth him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that Sin again, and saith, <hi>Let him that is filthy be filthy still.</hi> Or it may be, he shall be left to another Sin, it may be to Murder it self, which is the greatest Sin against the Second Table of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

If there is a man in this Congregation that never sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, Let not that man repent; but such an one there is not, nor in the whole world, nor ever was there since <hi>Adam,</hi> except only <hi>the Man Christ Iesus.</hi> As for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="34" facs="unknown:000879_0035_0FAC9501E9D79028"/>
yet they are to renew their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Especially, if they have been guilty of backslidings from God, or have through Temptation fallen into any known Sin, it concerns them Solemnly to renew their Repentance for that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Sin. When the Churches in <hi>Asia</hi> were like the Churches in <hi>New-England,</hi> very much degenerated, Christ from Heaven called upon them to Repent, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they had repented many years before that. Yea, though a man should walk with never such exactness before the Lord, so as not to fall into any Sin against his Conscience for many years together; for all that he must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue repenting all his dayes. Let ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Antinomians</hi> upon whom God ha's sent strong Delusion, say and think what they please, a Christian must never cease re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting of Sin. That man who pretends to Peace &amp; Assurance of his Justification without this, does but deceive his own Soul. He does but walk in the light of a fire which himself ha's kindled, and continuing so to dy, he shall lye down in Sorrow when repentance will be too late.

                     <hi>Adams</hi> Sin, Original Sin, the Sin of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief are exceeding great Sins.

Know there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that you must either live or dy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever according as you shall obey this Commandment of the Gospel. It is said of the Gentiles, that God gave them <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance unto Life.</hi> Act. 11.19. So then <hi>Life</hi> is concerned. As for Impenitent sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, they are all under a sentence of Condemnation. The Law ha's found them guilty: And <hi>God the Iudge of all</hi> ha's Condemned them to dye Eternally. It is in vain for any Sinner in the world to think that the sentence of Death which God ha's pronounced upon him shall be reversed, or his Sins pardoned if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent not.

that <hi>Repentance and Remission of Sins should be Preached in his Name.</hi> Act. 24 47. To Preach remission of Sins in the Name of Christ, without Preaching Repentance is to profane that Sacred Name.

And therefore think seriously and sadly of the day of Judgment. God Commands all men to repent, <hi>because he ha's appointed a day in which he will Iudge the World in Righteousness, by that man whom he hath ordained.</hi> Act. 17 31. Would you have all your Secret Sins revealed in the hearing of Heaven and Earth? If you would not, repent of them all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that so they may be blotted out of that book where they are all written. Remember this awful word; <hi>If thou shouldest dy with the guilt of but one Sin on thy Soul Unrepent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, at the day of Iudgment thou wilt wish that thou hast never been-born.</hi> And to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken them unto repentance, let Sinners know that that great day of the Lord is near at hand.

Nevertheless, a few things let me now speak to you in the Name of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Consider. 1. <hi>You have been a great Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:</hi> And in very Truth a great Fool. Although you are little &amp; young in years, you are great in Wickedness. It is seldom seen that one so young as you are, ha's been guilty of such Prodigious wickedness. You are (as I understand) hardly Nineteen years old, and yet ripe for a Lamentable Destruction as to your Body, if not as to your Soul. You are known to be guilty of Fornication and that more than once, and with more persons than one, as young as you are: Oh horrid Shame! But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that, you have been guilty of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: Yea, and of unnatural Murder too. <hi>Can a woman forget her Sucking Child that she should not have Compassion on the Son of her Womb?</hi> She may, but then she must be unnatural. And so monstrously unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural have you been, as not to have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion on the Son of your Womb: but to be guilty of Murdering it, whose blood Cryes for Vengeance against you, from the ground where you exposed it to death. You have defiled the Land wherein you live. It should be an humbling Consid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <hi>New-England</hi> must fare the worse, and be exposed to the wrath of Heaven if you should be suffered to live any longer in it: for so does the Scripture speak. Numb. 35.31, 33. <hi>You shall take no satisfaction for the Life of a Murderer which is guilty of blood. You shall not pollute the Land wherein you are, for blood it defileth the Land, and the Land can not be cleansed of the blood which is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.</hi> Methinks you should sometimes hear the blood of your woful Infant, Crying, <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance! Vengeance! Lord,</hi> upon my unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Mother, who murdered me as soon as I came into the World. And what if you murdered its Soul as well as Body? What then do you think will come on you? Nevertheless as vile a Sinner as you have been.</p>
                  <p>Consider 2. <hi>If you go to the Lord with a truly penitent heart, God will for Christ sake forgive your sin.</hi> This will God do, not for the sake of your penitence, (be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and confounded thou sinful Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) but for the sake of the merit of the Death of his own Son, who shed his Blood, that so the bloodiest Sinners who penitently believe on his Name, might be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> and saved from Eternal Death.
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:000879_0041_0FAC950670870110"/>
That Sentence of Death which is passed on you as to your Body, cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed; but the Sentence of Everlasting Death may. As yet it is possible that you may be saved from the <hi>Second Death.</hi> There is merit enough in the Death of Christ to make atonement for as great Sinners as you are. His Blood is a <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain set open for Sin and for Uncleanness.</hi> Zech. 13.1. But to whom is it set open? To <hi>them that mourn</hi> in Jerusalem. Thy heart has been an Hell of Sin: A Sink of Uncleanness, but if thy heart be broken for your sins, the opened Fountain of the Blood of Christ will make that horribly defiled Soul to become pure, and it shall live. The Lord Jesus Christ excludes none from partaking in the Salvation purchased by the price of his Blood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have been great Sinners. He came into the world to save the chief of Sinners. As great sinners as ever lived in the world, upon their repenting and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving on his Name, have through the exceeding abundant Grace of God, had all their sins forgiven. What black Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners had some of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> been, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Conversion? They had been guilty of Fornication, and besides <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

His prayer was heard, when he said with a truely penitent heart, <hi>Deliver me from blood guiltiness, O God.</hi> Psal. 51.14. What a bloody Sinner had <hi>Manasseb</hi> been?

and Crucified, obtained through him the forgiveness of that, and all other sins which they had been guilty of. Such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances are recorded in the Scripture, that so no Sinners, (no, not the greatest) might despair of finding mercy upon true Repentance towards God, and Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>Consider 3. <hi>If you dy in your sins without Repentance, you shall receive no ordinary dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>: Because you have sinned not only against the Law of God more heinously than many have done, but also against the Gospel of Christ. You have refused to hear the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber one that was Executed in this Town many years ago, for the same Crime which you have been guilty of, and must dy for; Confessed that his neglecting to hear the Word of God, which he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently absented himself from on the Lords Days, lay as an heavy burden on his Conscience; and so it should do on yours. To go to Hell from under the Gospel is a fearful thing. Since you Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment, nay, since your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

How shall you escape the sorest Damnation, if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not this offer of mercy. If <hi>Indians</hi> that never heard of the Name of Christ, commit such sins as you have done, they must go to Hell for it, but not to such a fiery place there as you shall, because of your disobedience to the Calls of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. It will be more tolerable for <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> at the Day of Judgment, then for the despisers of the Gospel, and of the Grace of God. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

few in the world that lay sin to heart as they should do. The Prophet complained that there were in a manner none. Jer. 8.6. <hi>I hearkned and heard, but no man repented of his wickedness, saying what have I done.</hi> There are great sins, which but few have a due sence of their guiltiness before God in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of them. <hi>Adams Sin</hi> was a great one: An hainous transgression is expressed, by saying, <hi>Like Adam they have transgressed the Covenant.</hi> Hos. 6.7.

When God his Maker had made him Lord over all the Creatures on the face of the Earth, he was not satisfyed with that, but aspired to be a God too.

God had been so bountiful as to give him free leave to eat of all the Trees in <hi>Eden</hi> excepting one, he would be Stealing that too. Yet this grievous sin is by a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Imputation</hi> the sin of every man. The Papists say of their <hi>Bonaventure, In hoc ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine non peccavit Adam,</hi> that he had no guilt of <hi>Adams</hi> sin upon him. But the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle tells us, that <hi>in Adam all have sinned.</hi> Rom. 5.12. Yet how few are there that have any sence of their guiltiness on the account of this great iniquity? Or, that did ever mourn before the Lord for it? That which we commonly (from <hi>Austin</hi> who first and fitly gave it that Name) call <hi>Original Sin,</hi> or (as the Apostle expresseth it) <hi>the Sin which dwells in us,</hi> is no little evil. That corruption of nature which men bring into the world with them, is evil beyond all expression. The Apostle sayes that <hi>Sin taking Occasion by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment wrought in him all manner of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence.</hi> Rom. 7.8.

                     </hi> It is impossible to call it by a worse name than it self, or to give it a worse <hi>Epithite,</hi> than that of <hi>Sinful.</hi> Yet how do men make light of this sin? Jews and Papists in their writings will hardly own it to be a sin. And there are many who never did shed one tear, or send one sigh up to Heaven, because of the guiltiness of their Souls before the Lord, by their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Corruption. The sin of unbelief or disobedience to the Gospel is a great sin. The Spirit of God will one day <hi>Convince the world of Sin,</hi> that is to say, Convince them that they have been guilty of a great and hainous sin, <hi>because they have not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved on Christ.</hi> Joh. 16.9. Disobedience to the Gospel is a greater evil than disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Law, and will be followed with a severer Judgment at last. Heb 12.28, 29. <hi>He that despised Moses Law dyed without Mercy: of how much sorer punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment suppose you, he shall be thought worthy that has trampled under foot the Son of God.</hi> The unbeliever has done so.

before the Lord by reason of this sin? There is no man that has not been guilty of numberless Actual Sins. <hi>David</hi> was sensible of this: he saw his sins were like a mighty Army which he could not see to the end of them, and <hi>his heart failed him,</hi> he was ready to dy away at the sight of them. Psal 40.12. To the same purpose <hi>Ezra,</hi> and others of the Lords Servants. Ezr. 9.6. <hi>Iniquities are increased over our heads.</hi> They had more sins than there are drops of water in a deep river enough to drown them: <hi>And our trespass is gone up unto the Heavens<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> An heap of Sand which shall reach as high as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, must have an infinite number of Sands in it: So is every man guilty of an Infinite number of sins. But how few are sensible of this? Men do not mourn for their own sins, much less for the sins of others. The holy Apostle reproveth the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in that when one in their Communion was found guilty of Incest, <hi>they had not Mourned.</hi> 1 Cor. 5.2. They would have done well to have set some time apart to Fast and Mourn because of the dishonour done to the Name of Christ, and the wound which Religion received by means of that Scandalous person. The
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:000879_0055_0FAC9511EBDFC408"/>
Psalmist could say, not only that he <hi>beheld the Transgressors and was grieved,</hi> but that <hi>Rivers of waters run down his Eyes because men kept not the Law of God.</hi> Psal. 119.136. How few can say after him?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>They that seek to Excuse and Extenuate Sin, make too light of it.</hi> Thus our first Parents did. The woman who was first in the Transgression, would lay the blame at the Serpents door: <hi>The Serpent beguiled me.</hi> Thus <hi>Eves</hi> Children think to Excuse or Extenuate their sin by laying the fault on the Devil. Why would you do such an evil thing? The Devil Tempted me say they. The man sought to make some excuse for himself by accusing his Wife<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; silently reflected on the providence of God, <hi>The woman whom thou gavest me she gave to me of the Tree and I did eat.</hi> Gen. 3.12. Thus sinners to Extenuate their Crimes will reflect upon God: They say, If God had given me Grace, I should not have done so wickedly. Ever since <hi>Adams fall</hi> it has been natural for men to excuse and extenuate their faults either by blaming others, or by some other pretext. When <hi>Aaron</hi> committed a great Sin in making the Calfe in the Wilderness, what a frivolous excuse did he make for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:000879_0056_0FAC951260050198"/>
that the people brought him some Gold, and he cast it into the fire, <hi>and there came out a Calfe.</hi> Exod. 32.24. As if it had been only by <hi>Chance</hi> and not of <hi>Choice</hi> that a thing like a Calfe came out of the fire. The Jewish <hi>Rabbis</hi> in their writings excuse that fact of <hi>Aaron,</hi> pretending that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed not to make such an Idol, but that there was an Extraordinary operation of the Devil in that matter; but this fiction of theirs is against the Scripture, which declares the activity of <hi>Aaron</hi> in the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Idol. <hi>Verse</hi> 4. <hi>He fashioned it with a graving tool</hi>: but then he had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther excuse to lessen his Crime. <hi>Verse</hi> 22. <hi>Thou knowest the people they are set on mis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If a good man, a <hi>Saint of the Lord,</hi> as <hi>Aaron</hi> was, will when under Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on find excuses for great sins, will not sinners do so much more? We read con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Saul,</hi> when he spared <hi>Agag</hi> &amp; the <hi>Amalahites</hi> substance, contrary to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Commandment of God, he endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to extenuate his Crime, by pretending that he was afraid to displease the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 24. <hi>I have transgressed the Commandment of the Lord, because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.</hi> And he
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:000879_0057_0FAC9514E60225F8"/>
had another excuse, <hi>viz. that the best of the sheep and of the oxen were spared for Sacrifice unto the Lord.</hi> vers. 15. Thus men think to extenuate the evil of their sin, by pretending that they intended no hurt in what they did: But Sin is such an Evil, as the best intention in the world can never make it to be good. Others think to excuse what they have done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss, by pretending that if it were sin, yet it was no great sin. <hi>Ephraim</hi> said, <hi>they shall find no iniquity in me that were sin.</hi> Hos. 12.8. He means, no Iniquity that were a great sin. Nevertheless, <hi>he loved to Oppress</hi>; but thought that such Oppression as that which the Prophets charged him with, was no such great sin. Men are apt to say of their sins, as <hi>Lot</hi> said of <hi>Zoar,</hi> Gen. 19.20. <hi>It is a little One? Is it not a little One?</hi> They call their sins <hi>peccadillo's</hi>; whereas no sin can be so absolutely consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. Altho some sins compared with others are small, nevertheless, that which is (as the least sin is) an offence against the Infinite Majesty, cannot be a little Evil.

For no man can tell a Ly without dishonouring God, by sinning against him: And it were better that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man in the world should perish, then that God should be dishonoured.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>They that justifie them selves or others in sin, make too light of it.</hi> To justifie and patronize evil deeds, or evil persons, is worse then only to extenuate what has been amiss. It is therefore said, that <hi>he that justifies the wicked is an abomination to the Lord.</hi> Prov. 17.15. If a man knows another to be wicked, and shall then and therefore justify him, he is an abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Lord. Nevertheless, a good man being under temptation may justifie himself when he has erred greatly. So did <hi>Ionah</hi>; when it was said to him, <hi>dost

thou do well to be angry</hi>? He replied, <hi>I do well to be angry even unto death.</hi> Whereas he had no just reason at all to be angry, much less even <hi>unto death,</hi> that is as long as he lived. But they are ill men who will justifie themselves or others in scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous sins. Isa. 5.20 <hi>We unto them that call evil good, and good evil, that put dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for light, and light for darkness, that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter.</hi> They that stand to vindicate scandalous evils a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the express Word of God, do so. Thus did <hi>Saul,</hi> for which cause <hi>Samuel</hi> charged him with Rebellion and Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornness. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.23. He sinned against the express Commandment of God, and that was <hi>Rebellion.</hi> He stood to justifie himself, saying, he had not sinned, but done as he ought to do; and this was <hi>Stubbornness.</hi> The like Stubbornness we see in <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> of whom it is recorded <hi>that they came out and stood at the door of their tents.</hi> Numb. 16.27 which was boldly to declare that they would stand to what they had done.

And yet he had as unstained a youth as most in the world. He feared the Lord from his youth; nevertheless could remember some sins and vanities of his youth; &amp; a sorrowful (not a pleasant) remembrance it was to him. He would not tell of the vanities of his youth to make others merry. There are some that take pleasure in seeing others sin; which argues an high degree of Impiety. Rom. 1.32. <hi>They not only do things worthy of death, but take pleasure in them that do them.</hi> Yea, there are that when they cannot commit sin themselves, delight in seeing others do it; which is perfect <hi>Diabolism.</hi> The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils are not drunk themselves, nor do they commit Adultery, being Spirits and not Bodies, they are not capable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting those sins, but they take pleasure in seeing men commit those sins.

have been spoken prove them to be so. None but Fools would make a light mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of such an Evil as Sin is. But further to inlarge on the <hi>Probation</hi> of the Truth before us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Scripture every where speaks of Sinners as of Fools. How often are they in the Holy Writings, (in the Book of <hi>Iob</hi>; and in the <hi>Psalms,</hi> and in <hi>Proverbs,</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi>) called <hi>fools.</hi> The Scripture says of them that they are <hi>foolish.</hi> Psal. 5.4. <hi>The foolish, i. e.</hi> Sinners <hi>shall not stand in thy sight.</hi> When they come to be tryed for their lives before Gods Tribunal, they will not be able to stand in the judgment. The Hebrew word <hi>HOLEPIM,</hi> there Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>foolish,</hi> signifieth <hi>mad men,</hi> or such as rave with folly; Sinners are subject to <hi>moral madness</hi>: If they were not raving mad they would never do as they do. Madness is in their hearts as long as they live, and after that they go to the dead, nay, to the damned. Sinners are said to be without knowledge. Psal. 14.4. <hi>Have all the workers of Iniquity no knowledge.</hi> Truly, there is not one of them all that has any saving knowledge; such of them as are wise to do evil, to do good they have no knowledge. Isa. 27.11. <hi>It is a

people of no understanding.</hi> They are called <hi>simple ones.</hi> Prov. 1.22. <hi>How long ye simple ones will ye love simplicity.</hi> Hence the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture compares them to Beasts, because they act as if they were devoid of all reason or rational understanding. Psal. 49.10. <hi>Wise men dy, likewise the bruitish person:</hi> Who but a Sinner is that <hi>bruitish person?</hi> A Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is resembled to the most stupid of all Beasts; To the Ass, to the wild Ass, nay, to the wild asses colt. Job 11.12. <hi>Man is born like the wild asses colt.</hi> A Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is a born fool: They are compared to the silly Birds, to simple fearful Doves. Hos. 7.11. <hi>Ephraim is like a silly Dove without heart.</hi> Yea, they are compared to Ostriches. Lam. 4.3. The Ostrich is both a very foolish and an unnatural Bird.

True spiritual wisdom and understanding is in fearing the Lord, which is contrary

They that are wise unto Salvation are wise indeed; and therefore Godly men are the only wise men, and will be found to be so at last. Yea, wiser than the greatest Clerks or Politicians in the world, that have not Grace in their hearts. A man may excel in political wisdom, and in philosophical wisdom, and yet a poor illeterate obscure person, that makes no figure in the world, but Loveth and Serveth God and Jesus Christ, will be found a wiser man than the other, because of his being wise unto Salvation; which is the only true wisdom.

They asked him the reason of his weeping, who replied, you may see there an ugly Toad: I cannot but weep, to think of the goodness of God towards me, who instead of making me a Toad, has made me a man with a rational Soul
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:000879_0072_0FAC9522CCCFDC88"/>
capable to know, and love, and serve God. At this the two Learned men fell a wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping too, saying to one another, this poor illeterate Shepherd will go to Heaven when he dyeth; for he loveth God and serveth him; but we with all our Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are like to go to Hell: He is an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier and wiser man than we are. So then there is no Sinner in the world that is a wise man, if we speak of true hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly wisdom. For,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sin is the greatest Folly. Psal. 85.8. <hi>Let them not turn again to folly, i. e.</hi> to Sin. Prov. 8.11. <hi>As a dog returns to his vomit, so a fool returns to his folly.</hi> A Dog has not the reason to consider and think with himself, that the thing which he vomi's up, was it which made him sick, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he returns to it again. Just so it is with Sinners. It may be they have felt pain by their sins, their Bodies have been hurt thereby: And it may be their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences have smarted for what they have done; yet they will commit those Sins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Thus do they return to their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Such fools are they. All Sin is folly: For it is against the rules of wisdom: All the Precepts contained in the Law or Word of God are wise precepts. There
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:000879_0073_0FAC95245A61EFD0"/>
is no Sin but it is a Transgression of one or other of them. Jer. 8.8, 9. <hi>How do you say, we are wise? They have rejected the Word of the Lord, and what wisdom is in them?</hi> Sin is a departure from God the fountain of all wisdom: And therefore the more men sin, the more unwise are they. The greatest Sinners are the greatest fools in the world. <hi>In the greatness of their folly they go astray.</hi> Prov. 5.23. And as all Sin is folly, so there are some Sins which are in a most peculiar manner so. Sins of Uncleanness are most abominable folly. When <hi>Shechens</hi> had defiled <hi>Dinah,</hi> it was said of him, that he had <hi>wrought folly in Israel, which thing ought not to be done.</hi> Gen. 34.7. Sins of that nature bruitify men.

a Fool belonging to him: he that has all the properties of a Fool is one. That property which the Text before us speaks of is enough to prove the Sinner to be a Fool if there were nothing more. A Fool will laugh and make himself merry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with that which is matter of grief and sorrow. And do not Sinners do so, like mad Fools. Prov. 26.18. <hi>As a mad man who casteth fire brands, arrows, and death, so is the man that deceiveth his Neighbour and sayes, am not I in sport</hi>? A mad man will throw whatever comes next to hand, though it be a Fire brand, or a dart, or any thing else that shall cause death, and makes sport of it: If he wounds his Neighbour for which he ought to be grieved, that is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

People will sometimes when the phrenzy takes them kill their own Relations, and (though they have cause to mourn for what they have done all their dayes) they rejoyce in it. We are informed of a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical instance of this nature which hapned in a place in <hi>Wales</hi> not five Months ago. A distracted man in a mad fit killed his Wife and all his four Children in one bloody morning, without any remorse for what he had done. Another sad instance there is in this Land is a neighbour Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: A poor woman now in Prison, cut the throat of her own Son, at which she rejoyceth, imagining that she has notably imitated the Faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> in Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing her Son A mad man will some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cut and wound his own body, and then Laugh at his own misery. And do not distracted Sinners do thus and worse than this? They gash and wound their own Souls by their Sins, and yet laugh at what they have done. It is impossible for a man to make himself Drunk, or Unclean, or to tell a known Lye, without making a wound in his Conscience, which he will be sensible of whenever he shall come to himself and see his undone Soul bleeding to death.

what shall be hereafter. A wise man will lay up a good foundation against the Time to come: he'l provide against a rainy day. Prov. 10.5. <hi>He that gathereth in Summer is a wise Son.</hi> He that is wise will in Summer provide against Winter. It is said of the Ants that they are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wise, <hi>because they prepare their meat in the Summer.</hi> Prov. 30.25. Alas! Sinners have not this wisdom. They are like beasts without reason who only indulge their present senses, but have no thoughts where they must be, or how they shall live a few years hence. If men were wise they would be often thinking of another world. They would prepare for Death, and provide for Eternity. Deut. 32.29. <hi>O that they were wise that they understood this, that they would Consider their latter end.</hi> They that are wise will consider their latter end. They will remember Death &amp; Eternity. Why are some of the Virgins in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble called <hi>Foolish Virgins,</hi> but because they did not take care to get <hi>Oyl into their Vessels,</hi> Grace into their hearts, and so be provided and prepared for the day of the Lords coming!

I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member a Reverend Author speaks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a certain noble man that had a Servant belonging to his Family that was counted a Fool,

Into another world sayes he: And when will you come again says his Fool to him, a Month hence, or a year hence, or how long first. I must never come again, says his Master, and I shall never see thee any more. And (said the Servant) have you made any provision for that world which you are going into, never to come here again? No, said his Lord, I have not: No (said the poor Fool) then He give you your Staff again, for I my self was never more Fool then so: Not to think of a world to which I must go, and from which I must never return is greater folly than

                  <p n="3">3. It is the property of a fool to refuse a good offer. When that is offered to him, which would make him happy, if he had an heart and wisdom to embrace it, he foolishly neglects his opportunity. Prov 17.16. <hi>Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing he has no heart to it.</hi> Thus it is with Sinners: They have Spiritual Riches offered to them in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; they are told of that which will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich their Souls, and make them for ever. The <hi>Unsearchable Riches of Christ</hi> will do so. And that is freely offered to them in the Gospel. Where that is preached, God from Heaven makes an offer of his Son to be an Husband and a Saviour to every Soul that will believe on him; but foolish Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners make light of this offer, altho they never had, nor never shall have another offer like unto it. Mat 22.4.5. <hi>All things are ready; come unto the Marriage, but they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his Farm, and another to his Merchandize.</hi> And are not they fools that will refuse an offered Christ for a Farm? And all the Riches of the Son of God, the Heir of all things, for the Merchandize of this world?
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:000879_0081_0FAC9529A6702DF0"/>
Christ also offereth himself in the Gospel, but Sinners refuse him. <hi>Wisdom,</hi> that is <hi>Christ,</hi> complains of this folly in Sinners. Prov. 1.24, 25. <hi>I have called, and ye refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, I have stretched out my hand and no man regarded, but ye have set at naught all my counsel.</hi> And that which addeth to the folly, is, that Sinners do thus again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, many a time and often. The Lord Jesus Christ is graciously pleased to offer himself to them with all his saving bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, but they continue in their refusals of him. Mat.23.37. <hi>O Ierusalem, Ierusalem, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="4">4. It is the property of a fool to make an ill choice: Not only to refuse a good offer when he may have it, but to take a bad one. It has been the manner in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Courts, when any person has been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaded for a fool to try him by offering a piece of Gold and a Counter, something of great value, or an apple; if he chuseth the Counter rather than the Gold, the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple rather than the Jewel, then he is cast for a fool, and his Estate taken from him,

do they make, who chuse Hell rather than Heaven! This Sinners do. They love death. When life and death, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and hell are set before them, they chuse death and hell. Ezek. 33.11. <hi>Why will you dy.</hi> They will, they chuse death in the causes of it: The things which will certainly end in death, are the things which they chuse. For a man to chuse Eternal rather than a Temporal Death, is a very unwise choice. It was well &amp; wisely said by one of our English Martyrs when one tempted him to Conform against the light of his Conscience, to the Superstition of the Times; because he would loose his life if he did not, and (said the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) death is bitter, and life is sweet: To whom the Martyr replied, but <hi>Death E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal is more bitter, and Life Eternal is more sweet.</hi> Alas! Sinners have not the wisdom to consider this. <hi>Ioshua</hi> said to the Children of <hi>Israel, Chuse you whom you will Serve, but I and my House will serve the Lord.</hi> Thus when it is said to a Sinner, chuse whom thou wilt have to be thy Master; he makes the unhappiest choice that possibly can be: he chuseth the worst Master that ever any one did serve: For he chuseth to be a Servant of Sin: he had

rather be a Slave than a Free man; yea, a Slave to Sin and Satan, then the Lords Free-man.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is the property of a fool to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with one that is too strong for him. A Wise man will sit down and consider with himself, whether he is able with ten thousand, to meet with him that cometh against him with twenty thousand. <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.31. Better sit still then rise and fall. But Sinners have not the understanding to consider this. They are so foolish as to set themselves against one that is Infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly too strong for them. Is a Sinner a fit match for the Almighty? Is he able to make his patty good with that God before whom the Nations are as the drop of a bucket, and counted as the small dust of the ballance, yea less then nothing and vanity? Is he able to make his party good with that God, who holds all the water of the Sea in the hollow of his hand, and who measures Heaven with a span. O Sinner, consider with thy self, what thou will do, when God shall strike thee with those hands which have made heaven and earth. <hi>Do we provoke the Lord to jealousie, are we stronger than he?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.22. What infinite folly are they guilty of that do so?
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:000879_0085_0FAC952EC4536430"/>
Nevertheless the Sinner does so. Job 15.25, 26. <hi>For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengthens himself against the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, he runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses of his buckler.</hi> The Threatnings and Sanctions of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Law are the bosses of his buckler; but the Sinner regards them not. But canst thou stand it out against God? Can thy hands be strong, or can thy heart en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure in the day that the Lord shall deal with thee? Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him? dost thou not know that his Power is Irresistible? When he casts forth his Lightnings, what man is there that can stand before the Thunder of God? It is reported concerning <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Histories inform us of Kings that have been Slain with Lightning when they have been surround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Armies to defend them. Who can stand before the Omnipotent God when once he is angry? Rocks cannot, for the Rocks are thrown down by him, when his fury is poured out like fire. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Island of <hi>Sicily</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> saw this to be true

not many years since. And the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> saw it but a few months ago; when Rivers of Fire broke out of a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain near unto them. <hi>Mountains</hi> cannot stand before his Indignation: For he O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturns the Mountains in his anger, and those Pillars of Heaven tremble at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof: Nay, Angels the mightiest and most powerful Creatures in the World cannot stand before him: He spared not the Angels that sinned, but cast them down to Hell. It was Inexpressible folly in the Apostate Angels to set themselves against their Almighty Creator? Well might <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaz</hi> say, <hi>His Angels he charged with Folly.</hi> Job 4.18. If then silly Worms on the Earth shall rise up against him, are they not fools for so doing.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is the property of a fool to make foolish bargains: So does the Sinner do; for he barters away his precious Soul, and that for a thing of naught. There is no Sinner, but he has a Jewel belonging to him, more worth then all this world, namely, his precious and immortal Soul; this he parts with, and what has he in exchange for it?

Rather then deny his sensual appetite in respect of a lust of Drunkenness, or of a lust of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness, he'll loose his soul. What grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter folly can there be then to part with pleasures for evermore in Heaven, &amp; to go into Eternal Torments, and all to enjoy the momentany pleasures of Sin? It was a sad word which a miserable man once uttered on a death-bed. <hi>I have</hi> (said he) <hi>enjoyed the pleasures of sin for a little while, and now I must be in torment for infinite mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Ages.</hi>

                  <p>Inf. 1. <hi>What folly are they guilty of who make light of the greatest Sins?</hi> There are those in the world that do so.

who make light of this horrible Sin. If they be but a little provoked they'l Curse &amp; Swear like Devils incarnate: And then think to Excuse it, by saying, such an one provoked me. And art not thou a Fool to provoke the Eternal God, only because thy Neighbour has provoked thee? There are <hi>Oaths</hi> unto which men to shew how light they make of being guilty of them, have given the Name of <hi>Petty Oaths:</hi> They think that for them to Swear by their Faith and by their Troth is a small evil if any at all: but it is a great Sin to do so. All Swearing by Creatures is a grievous sin. To <hi>Swear by things that are no Gods</hi> is great impiety. <hi>Ier.</hi> 5.7.

Tit. 3.2, 3. <hi>Let us shew all meekness towards all men, for we our selves were sometimes foolish.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. This Doctrine calls upon us to be deeply humbled for Sin. What has a fool to be proud of? No Sinner has cause to be proud of any thing, but to come down and sit in the dust before the Lord all his dayes. It is an humbling thing to be left to an act of folly, but what then is it to have an heart full of nothing else but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? so has the Sinner. Rom. 7 18. <hi>I know that in me, that is in my flesh dwelleth no good

thing.</hi> They that are only flesh, that have nothing but nature in them, have nothing but sin and folly dwelling in them; and they have been guilty of innumerable acts of extream folly, the thought whereof ought to humble them. Every Sinner may make <hi>Sauls</hi> confession. 1 Sam 26.21. <hi>I have sinned, I have played the fool, I have erred exceedingly.</hi> Sinners have been doing nothing but <hi>playing the fool</hi> all their dayes. For what have they been doing? What have they been thinking of? What have their cares been exercised about all their dayes? only or chiefly about their Bodies, and not their Souls; not how they may make sure of Heaven, but how they may live, and get Estates on the Earth. <hi>This their way is their folly.</hi> Psal. 49.13. And they into whose hearts God has put spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual wisdom, have cause sad enough to walk humbly all their dayes, remembring what fools once they were. <hi>Remember what you were in times past.</hi> Eph. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>11. How sinful, how foolish! There was a Time when you had no spiritual wisdom in you; a time when you were in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; a time when you knew not God. Let us remember those dayes. and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of them, and let the thought of them
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:000879_0094_0FAC9536D1B04260"/>
keep us humble as long as we shall have a day to live. Moreover, there is a great deal of folly still remaining in the wisest and holiest heart on the earth: We see it in <hi>David,</hi> a man wise like an Angel of God, yet what pride and folly did he discover in causing <hi>Ioab</hi> to number the people, which he himself was very sensible of afterwards, confessing his sin and folly, and begging pardon for it. 2 Sam 24.10. <hi>Lord, take away the iniquity of thy Servant, for I have done very foolishly.</hi> We see the like in <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> What foolish pride did that wise and good man discover to be in his heart, when the Ambassadors from <hi>Babylon</hi> came to him. God left him that he might know what was in his heart; And he saw such pride and folly there, as brought him upon his knees before the Lord. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.26. <hi>Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart.</hi> And the Truth is, that the more wisdom and grace any man has in his soul, the more has he of a deep and humbling sence of the folly which is in his heart. This we see in the holy Psalmist, who expresseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with such humble words as those, in Psal. 73.22. <hi>So foolish was I and ignorant, I was as a beast before thee.</hi> And we see

                  <p n="2">2. Oh turn from Sin immediately. If Sin is folly, then to turn from Sin unto the wayes of Holiness, is wisdom. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners leave your folly.

You can't turn from sin too soon, but you may think of turning when it will be too late. Why will you retain such an enemy as Sin? If a man should have a Serpent in his bosome, would he not get rid of it immediately. Sin is such a Serpent; it will fling thee to death, if thou doft not make haste to get clear of it. To delay this matter is dangerous fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. If <hi>Lot</hi> had delayed his going out of <hi>Sodom</hi> one day longer, he had lost his life.

Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Foolish Virgins, who when it was too late cryed, <hi>Lord, Lord, open to us.</hi> What is the dismal cry of the Damned in Hell for ever? Yea, what is the cry of those that have gone out of our Congregations, from the hearing of Sermons to Hell? Is it not this? Wo are we for ever, because we did not Turn from sin soon enough? Wo unto us for ever, because we delayed our Turning from sin! we thought we would repent some time hereafter, but before that time came, Death Seized on us, and now it is too late.
