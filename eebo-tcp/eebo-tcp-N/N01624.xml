            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MINISTERS of the Goſpel are in more reſpects than one, fitly compared to <hi>Earthen Veſſels;</hi> principally in that they are as <hi>Mortal</hi> as other Men. <hi>Do the Prophets Live for ever?</hi> But more eſpecially, in that they are (as <hi>Earthen Veſſels</hi> uſe to be) of ſmall account in the World. Chriſt's Kingdom not being of this World, He did not make uſe of the <hi>Princes of this World,</hi> to be the Diſpenſers of the Myſteries of it. <hi>Not many Mighty, not many Noble are called</hi> to that Work. Yet ſome ſuch there have been: Was not <hi>Solomon</hi> (a great <hi>King</hi> in <hi>Iſrael</hi>) a PREACHER? Was not <hi>Ambroſe</hi> of a Noble Romane Family? And <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> of an high Birth? And yet both theſe, after they had for ſome time plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Cauſes at the Bar, out of a deſire to do good, betook themſelves to the Study of Divinity, and became fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Preachert of the Goſpel. Was not <hi>George</hi> Prince of <hi>Anhall,</hi> a Protes;tant Miniſter, and an Eminent and Succeſſful Preacher of Christ? Was there not an Earl who became the Paſtor of a Church in <hi>Geneva?</hi> But <hi>many</hi> Indances there have not been, of honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Perſonages ſo employed. Our well obſerves, that the Work is <hi>Honourable</hi> enough in it <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:001928_0003_0FBA1D1081104EF0"/>of the World. Alſo among <hi>Earthen Veſſels</hi> ſome are of a finer Mould than others. So among Miniſters, there are ſome of a more Tender, others of a more Robuſtous Conſtitution. There are <hi>

                  </gap> Meliore luto pracordia finxit —</hi> One of the Ancients in his Book, <hi>De Paſtorali Cura,</hi> Obſerves that the Apoſtle Writing to <hi>Timothy,</hi> Exhorts him to uſe <hi>Gentleneſs,</hi> and to rebuke with <hi>Long Suffering;</hi> but he bids <hi>Titus</hi> reprove <hi>Sharply,</hi> he ſuppoſeth the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be, that <hi>Titus</hi> was of a more <hi>Mild</hi> diſpoſition and needed a Spur: but that <hi>Timothy</hi> was of a more <hi>quick</hi> and <hi>zealous</hi> Temper.</p>
            <p>Concerning that Worthy Perſon, whoſe lamented Death occaſioned the Preaching of the Judicious and Seaſonable <hi>Sermon</hi> Emitted herewith, I ſhall not ſay much; nor is it needful for me, Conſidering it has been done abundantly by Others. I had peculiar reaſon to know him, when he was a Student at the College. I then obſerved that he had a Pregnant Wit, and Strong Memory, and was an hard Student, whence it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follows that having (as he had) a conſiderable time to furniſh himſelf with variety of Learning, his accompliſhments muſt be Eminent. But that which made him chieſly deſireable, was, his Piety. His gifts were Sanctifyed with Grace and the Fear of GOD; from thence it was that when he became a Publick Preacher of the Goſpel, he ſet himſelf to promote the Good of Souls, and not to make an oſtentation of his own Gifts and Learning. He had a Natural <hi>Fervour</hi> of Spirit, which being Sanctifyed, made his Sermons,
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:001928_0004_0FBA260A24AEB388"/>by the bleſſing of God, the more Powerful &amp; Effectual. His <hi>Death</hi> is the more awful, not only in that he dyed when in his Prime; but in the ſame Week another faithful Miniſter of God was taken away, <hi>viz.</hi> The Reverend Mr. <hi>William Brattle,</hi> Paſtor of the Church in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> whom alſo I had reaſon to have an Intimate acquaintance with, for that I preſided over the College all the Time of his being a Fellow and a Tutor there; and I had much Comfort in his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. Had I not well known his Abilities, I would not have adviſed the precious Church in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> to have Elected and Ordained him their Paſtor, and at their and his deſire, performed that Office of Reſpect and Love, on <hi>November 25. 1696.</hi> He that <hi>holds the Stars in his right hand,</hi> was pleaſed to uphold him in the Paſtoral Office, ſome Months above Twenty Years. I am glad to ſee his Character already Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed; and that it is done without any <hi>Hyperbolizing,</hi> that which is there ſaid of him being true, and nothing but juſtice to his Memory. <hi>Honos fugientem ſequitur.</hi> He is the more worthy of the honour which has been put upon him, for that (as I am informed) he deſired that no mention ſhould be made of him in any <hi>Funeral Sermon;</hi> which altho' an evidence of his Humility, does not make it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful for any to act contrary to his deſire in that Matter. It is related concerning that holy <hi>Man of God,</hi> Mr. <hi>Carter,</hi> who was a Miniſter at <hi>Bramford</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> that he forbad any Funeral Sermon to be Preached for him. Notwithſtanding which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Mr. <hi>Samuel Ward</hi> of <hi>Ipſwich: (<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:001928_0005_0FBA260BED646C20"/>quantus vir fuit, Scripta loquuntur)</hi> his next Lecture Sermon was a Lamentation, for the Loſs which the Church of God had ſuſtained, in the Death of that Venerable Old Man, who to the admiration of all Men, at Fourſcore, which was the Year of his Death, Preached with as much Vigour as at Forty, without being ſubject to any decay in his Intellectuals. Mr. <hi>Brattle</hi> did not arrive to ſo great an Age. Nevertheleſs, the Death of ſuch an <hi>Aaron</hi> as he was, ought to be Lamented by Survivers, <hi>Numb. 20.29. 1 Sam. 25.1. Acts 8.2.</hi> Where ſhall there be found a ſuitable Succeſſor? Since the College is in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> the Pastor of the Church there ſhould be One of very Eminent accompliſhments, One of great Learning and Orthodoxy, able to inſtruct the Scholars, and to eſtabliſh them in <hi>Calvinian Anti-Arminian</hi> Principles. Should the Learned Youth be tainted with <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> it may prove fatal to theſe Churches. My Learned Friend and Brother Mr. <hi>Samuel Lee,</hi> when on his Death-bed, had a great concern on his Spirit about that Matter, ſome body having made him believe (unjustly I hope) that the Young Students were adviſed to read <hi>Arminian Authors.</hi> God forbid. <hi>Cambridge</hi> has been lifted up to Heaven. <hi>Hooker, Shepard, Mitchel, Oakes</hi> have been Preachers there. And what Church in the World, did ever enjoy Four ſuch Preachers Succeſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly! Concerning Mr. <hi>Mitchel</hi> (my moſt dear Friend, whom I can never forget) I remember the admirably Learned Mr. <hi>Chauncey</hi> (who was alſo a famous Preacher in <hi>Cambridge</hi> as well as <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident</hi>
               <pb n="v" facs="unknown:001928_0006_0FBA2610894F3978"/>of the College there) when there was ſome little difference (and very little did they differ in any poine) between him and Mr. <hi>Mitchel,</hi> altho' Old enough to be his Father, Expreſſed his Love and Honour for Mr. <hi>Mitchel</hi> in theſe Words to me. <hi>If I would Envy any Man in the World, either for his Piety, or for his Ability, it would be Mr.</hi> Mitchel.</p>
            <p>It is alſo of Great Importance to the Intereſt of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that the Church in <hi>Boſton</hi> lately bereaved, ſhould be ſupplyed with another able Miniſter of the New Teſtament. And conſidering that they have been Exemplary for their Love and Dutiful Reſpect to thoſe who have been over them in the Lord, and formerly <hi>Spoke to them the Word of God;</hi> It is to be hoped that Chriſt will ſupply them. In the mean Time, I bleſs the Lord that they are not wholly deſtitute, or as Sheep without a Shepherd, but are favoured with One that has been (and I Hope and Pray that for many Tears he ſhall be) a great Bleſſing to them. The Lord with whom is the Reſidue of the Spirit, double His Spirit on him. But if they ſuffer him to be alone too long, under ſo great a burden, they cannot expect, but that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the <hi>Treaſure</hi> which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> has adorned him with, the Earthen Veſſel will break, when too heavy a burden lies too long upon it. Did not <hi>Moſes</hi> ſay, <hi>I am not able to bear this People alone, it is too heavy for me,</hi> Numb. <hi>11.14.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:001928_0007_0FBA261208B40AE8"/>
It is a good Note which a late Writer has, That <hi>Since Miniſters are Earthen Veſſels, they ſhould take heed of daſhing one againſt another.</hi> In ſpecial, Let Younger Miniſters take heed of <hi>daſhing</hi> againſt their <hi>Fathers.</hi> And therefore beware of Introducing <hi>Innovations</hi> which will cauſe it to be ſo, as long as there be any that are Conſcientiouſly concerned to maintain <hi>the Old Religion of New-England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Conclude with ſaying, It is a Comfort that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>Earthen Veſſels</hi> are broken, the <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> is not, nor ever ſhall be loſt. <hi>The Word of God liveth and abides for ever.</hi>

            <p>IN the beginning of this Chapter the Apoſtle doth declare that he, and his Fellow-Labourers did fulfil their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry with unfainting Diligence, and godly Sincerity. He then anſwers an Objection which might be made againſt the Goſpel; in that Multitudes who live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Diſpenſation of it, are not ſavingly Enlightened, but periſh in their Ignorance. To
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001928_0009_0FBA261A11D75648"/>this the Apoſtle anſwers, that the fault lay in themſelves; Satan the ruler of the darkneſs of this World had blinded their minds, leſt the Light of the Glorious Goſpel of Chriſt who is the Image of God, ſhould ſhine into them. The Apoſtle doth alſo mention a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Effect of God's Glorious Power in which the Goſpel is made uſe of as an Inſtrument, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. This miraculous Irradiation of the mind, the Apoſtle compares with that Creating work of God in <hi>commanding the Light to ſhine out of Darkneſs</hi> at firſt. And truly this work of God in the new Creation in forming a New and Divine Light in the Heart of a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, is as truly the Effect of Almighty Power, as that was when God ſaid, <hi>Let there be Light and there was Light.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. We have a Deſcription of the Goſpel. It is a <hi>Treaſure.</hi> We have this Treaſure. A Treaſure, ſays One, is an Abundance of Things Repoſited or laid up for the ſupply of future
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001928_0010_0FBA261C05E936D0"/>wants. It denotes a Plenty and Abundance of things Precious and Valuable.</p>

The Goſpel is compared, in the Context, to <hi>Light.</hi> Now the Light of the Glorious Goſpel by which the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Darkneſs is deſtroyed, is held forth out of Earthen Veſſels; Veſſels of baked Earth. The Expreſſion denotes their <hi>Meanneſs</hi> and <hi>Frailty.</hi> Goſpel Miniſters are of the ſame Mould with others; They are Fragil, Brittle Veſſels: Mortal Dying Creatures.</p>

               </list>
               <p>PROP. I. <hi>The Goſpel is a Treaſure.</hi> Such is the External Revelation of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; Much more ſo, is the Internal Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Glorious Truths and Myſteries of the Goſpel. Nothing doth ſo much improve and enrich the mind, as the Truth of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, when received in the Love of it. For the Proof and Illuſtration of this Propoſition.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Goſpel is <hi>a Treaſure, inaſmuch as in the Goſpel there's a Plenty, a Fulneſs of what
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001928_0012_0FBA261ECA2DA2F8"/>is moſt Precious and Excellent.</hi> There is a Treaſure wherein is an abundance of what is valuable. Now in the Goſpel we have the moſt needful, moſt uſeful, Diſcoveries made unto us: Wiſdom ſays, Prov. 8.6. <hi>Hear, I will ſpeak of Excellent things, and the opening of my lips ſhall be right things.</hi> In the Goſpel we have the Revelation of <hi>the Glory of God in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Now to know God and Chriſt, is Life Eternal. The Excellency of this knowlege is, that it gives Life to the Soul. God is the firſt Truth, and the chief Good. How Precious and Excellent then muſt the knowlege of Him be? We may better want the light of the <hi>Sun,</hi> then the light of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> In the Scriptures we have the Revelation of One GOD in Three Perſons; the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt. In the Scriptures we have the Revelation of <hi>that great Myſtery of Godlineſs, God manifeſt in the Fleſh.</hi> By the Scriptures God gives the knowlege of Salvation through a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer to ſuch periſhing Sinners as we are, who naturally ſit in Darkneſs and the ſhadow of Death. O Low invaluably precious is this Diſcovery of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which is made in the Goſpel. We are by Nature guilty Sinners, deeply in Debt to Divine Juſtice, and have nothing to pay: Certainly then, the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is a Rich Treaſure: For in this we have Chriſt reveal'd, and offered to us; in whom there is a compleat Righteouſneſs, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhauſtable
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001928_0013_0FBA26210E452AF0"/>Stock of Merit; the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Blood of whoſe Sacrifice being the Blood of Him that is God, is infinitely preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, of value ſufficient to be a Redemption-Price for the chief of Sinners. We are by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>altogether without ſtrength;</hi> empty of Grace, and full of Sin; Certainly then the Goſpel is an ineſtimable Treaſure, in which Chriſt is reveal'd and offer'd to us, <hi>of whoſe fulneſs we may receive, and grace for grace.</hi> Chriſt who is the Lord in whom <hi>we have Righteouſneſs and Strength,</hi> Iſai. 45.24. The Graces and Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the Spirit are convey'd to Believers by the Miniſtry of the Word. It is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſaid of Faith, Rom. 10.17. <hi>Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word.</hi> 1 Cor. 4.15. <hi>In Chriſt Jeſus I have begotten you through the Goſpel.</hi> In the Scriptures the Treaſures of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Knowlege which are hid in Chriſt are manifeſt and laid open. Agreably we have that Expreſſion, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3 8 Unto me who am leſs then the leaſt of all Saints, is this grace given, that I ſhould Preach among the Gentiles <hi>the unſearchable Riches of Chriſt.</hi> In and by the Goſpel God makes known what is <hi>the Riches of the glory of this Myſtery</hi> among the Gentiles which is Chriſt in you the hope of Glory. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> aſſureth us that what things were <hi>gain</hi> to him, he accounted <hi>loſs</hi> for Chriſt: yea, ſays he, I count all things but <hi>loſs</hi> for the <hi>Excellency of the Knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt my Lord.</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="unknown:001928_0014_0FBA26234ADB7EC8"/>Now we have this knowledge in the Scriptures; The Goſpel is <hi>the Goſpel of Chriſt;</hi> and the great Scope and Deſign of it is to give us the light of the knowlege of the Glory of God in the Face, in the Perſon of Jeſus Chriſt. Undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then the Word of God by which we are taught and inſtructed in this knowlege, is to be eſteemed an invaluable Treaſure. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold Wiſdom of God made known in the Scriptures is the <hi>Principal thing.</hi> It is <hi>Better than Rubies, and all the things that may be deſired, are not to be compared with it.</hi> Pſal. 19. <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the Soul.— The Judgments of the Lord are true, and righteous altogether. More to be deſired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold,</hi> — Here are Golden Rules laid down for the government of our Lives. Here are <hi>Exceeding great and precious Promiſes that by them we might be made partakers of the Divine Nature;</hi> which is the chief excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and glory of Man, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. In the Goſpel the Children of God have the <hi>promiſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</hi> Men are wont to eſteem the Writings whereby they hold their Eſtates: Now in the Sacred Scriptures God makes over Himſelf to His People as their Everlaſting Portion; and with Himſelf all that they need for Soul and Body, Time and Eternity. The Riches of Grace and the Riches of Glory are made ſure to Believers in Gods Word. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001928_0015_0FBA26264F25D690"/>brought Life and Immortality to light by the Goſpel, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. The Treaſures which are reſerved in Heaven for Gods People, are diſcovered in the Goſpel, and ſecured to Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. Now certainly, theſe Spiritual and Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Bleſſings are very Precious. They are a ſuitable and ſufficient ſupply for the Immortal Soul, which is our more noble part: they conſiſt of thoſe things which are in their own nature of ineſtimable value, and which are exactly ſuited to our wants and neceſſities. And then there is enough of them, an abundant plenty and fulneſs, every way ſufficient to fill all our wants, and ſatisfy all our deſires. Here's every good thing, and that in abundance. In the Goſpel there's an inexhauſtable <hi>Fountain Opened,</hi> at which we may be filled. A Fountain that can never be drawn dry, but is always full and flowing. Through the Goſpel God makes all Grace abound towards His People, that they <hi>always having alſufficiency in all things, may abound.</hi> Here then we ſee that the Goſpel is a Treaſure, in that in it is a plenty and fulneſs of what is moſt Excellent and Precious.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Goſpel may be compared to a <hi>Treaſure,</hi> in that <hi>it hath been in all Ages preſerved and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured for the uſe and benefit of the Church, by the eſpecial care of Gods Providence.</hi> Treaſures are wont to be laid up in places of Strength and Safety; to be preſerved with great care and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001928_0016_0FBA2628ECBD8590"/>The Promiſes of the Goſpel are made ſure; For in Chriſt they are Yea, and Amen. But what I deſign to conſider under this Head, is the wonderful care of God's Providence in preſerving the written Word from being loſt, or corrupted: To the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church of Old were committed the Oracles of God. And it is obſerved that the Ancient <hi>Jews</hi> preſerved the Letter of the Scripture entire. It is ſaid that the Men of the great Synagogue numbred the Verſes, Words, and Letters, of every Book, to prevent all poſſibility of corrupting the Text
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Godwyn's Antiq.</hi> p. 279.</note> in future times. So wonderfully did God Spirit them to preſerve the Scriptures pure, and tranſmit them entire to Poſterity. While Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of other Writings have been loſt, and the memorial of them hath periſhed; the Book of God is ſtill preſerved, by the ſingular care of His watchful Providence, as a Sacred Treaſure for the uſe and benefit of the Church. There was a Roman Emperor that Publiſhed an Edict for the aboliſhing the Scriptures
<note place="bottom">

               <p n="3">3. The Goſpel is a Treaſure, in that the Bleſſings and good things Exhibited and Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001928_0017_0FBA262A88F9AB20"/>in the Goſpel <hi>are incorruptible, and the Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them is reſerved for the People of God in the Heavenly World.</hi> When Men would lay up a Treaſure, they are wont to chooſe the moſt durable things; not periſhable Commodities, as they ſpeak. Now the Goſpel doth in this reſpect reſemble a Treaſure. It is the <hi>Everlaſting Goſpel,</hi> 1 Pet. 23, to 25. — <hi>The Word of God liveth and abideth for ever. — All Fleſh is as graſs, — the graſs withereth and the flower there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of falleth away. But the Word of the Lord endureth for ever. — And this is the word which by the Goſpel is Preached unto you.</hi> The true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Witneſs teſtifieth, <hi>Sooner may Heaven and Earth paſs away, then one jot or tittle of Gods Word fail.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then as a Treaſure is ſomething in Reſerve for time to come, ſomething laid up for a time of need: So the fulneſs of the Bleſſing of the Goſpel of Chriſt is laid up in Heaven for God's People. The glorious things ſpoken concerning the People of God in the Scriptures, will not have their full Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment till theſe Heirs of Glory are received to the open Viſion and full Fruition of God in Heaven.</p>
               <p>PROP. II. <hi>It hath pleaſed God to put this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in Earthen Veſſels.</hi> God hath committed the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel to Men fitly
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001928_0018_0FBA262D9CCAED08"/>compar'd to Earthen Veſſels. Such as theſe are Commiſſion'd and Empowred to Teach and Preach in Chriſts Name. They are by their Office Stewards of the Myſteries of God. 1 Cor. 9.17. <hi>A diſpenſation of the Goſpel is committed to me.</hi> To them is given the Miniſtry of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation. Now the Character which is here given to the Miniſters of the Goſpel is this, <hi>They are Earthen Veſſels.</hi> They are mean, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, dying Creatures. They are indeed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed from others in this, that they are betruſted with the Goſpel Treaſure, by vertue of their Office, as they are the Miniſters of CHRIST: but in other reſpects they are like other Men. Yea, many times more frail than their Brethren are.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Miniſters of the Goſpel that have this Treaſure, <hi>are formed out of the Duſt, and muſt in a little time return to the Earth.</hi> They are of the ſame Original with other Men. They may well ſay with <hi>Elihu,</hi> Job. 33.6. <hi>Behold, I am according to thy wiſh in Gods ſtead: I alſo am formed out of the Clay.</hi> 
                  <q>They who by their <hi>Commiſſion</hi> are the Miniſters of God, and ſo in Gods ſtead; are yet but as other Men in their <hi>Natural Structure</hi> and Conſtitution.</q> Tho' they are of Eſpecial Uſe in the Temple of God, yet reſpecting their frailty, They are Veſſels of <hi>Earth,</hi> not of <hi>Gold.</hi>

Their Bodies are framed and faſhioned out of the ſame Courſe, Earthy Materials; in this regard they are upon a level with their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. Therefore when <hi>Cornelius</hi> fell down at <hi>Peter</hi>'s feet, <hi>Peter</hi> took him up, ſaying, <hi>Stand up, I my ſelf alſo am a Man,</hi> Acts 10.26. Theſe Meſſengers of God are Spirits in fleſh. <hi>They dwell in houſes of Clay, whoſe foundation is in the Duſt.</hi> The Goſpel Treaſure is from above, from Heaven, Heavenly: but theſe Veſſels wherein it is contained, are of the Earth, Earthly, Such was our Father <hi>Adam,</hi> as his Name Signifies. <hi>God formed Him out of the duſt of the ground,</hi> Gen. 2.7. And the Miniſters of the Goſpel, as well as others, are begotten in his likeneſs, and bear his Image. Their Bodies are Earthly Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles, and will quickly Moulder down into Duſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. For we know, that if our <hi>Earthly</hi> houſe of this Tabernacle were diſſolved. They are Children of the <hi>firſt Adam,</hi> in whom we all die; they derive from him both Moral and Natural Corruption. They have the Seeds of Mortality and Corruption in their very Make and Conſtitution, as well as other Men. They are frail, brittle Ware, feeble, and ſoon broken. They may ſay with <hi>Job</hi> 1.12. <hi>Is my ſtreneth the strength of Stones? Or is my fleſh of Braſs?</hi> No, Miniſters are expos'd to the ſame Diſeaſes as other Men; To the ſame hurtful and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful impreſſions. Their Bodies are as vile as
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001928_0020_0FBA263484F71670"/>the Bodies of others; and many times more frail and crazy. 1 Tim. 5.23. — <hi>Thine often Infirmities.</hi> They ſpend and are ſpent in the work of the Miniſtry. The weight of their work helps many times to weaken and break their Conſtitution. The concern with which their Solemn Charge doth impreſs their Minds, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times conſumes their Spirits. They are waſted and worn away with the diſticulties they meet with in their Employment. The Treaſure which they hold helps to ſhatter and break to pieces theſe Earthen Veſſels, As New Wine burſts Old Bottles; to allude to our Saviour's expreſſion.</p>
               <p>In a little time they are broken to pieces by the ſtroke of Death. Zech. 1.5. <hi>Your Fathers, where are they? and the Prophets, do they live for ever? Peter</hi> knew that in a little time he muſt put off his Earthly Tabernacle, 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 1.14. <hi>Knowing that ſhortly I must put off this my Tabernacle.</hi> They are in Gods hand, as clay in the hand of the Potter; And when the work which he hath deſign'd for them is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd, He takes away their Breath, they die, and return to their Earth. Their Bodies are Sown in diſhonour and corruption As the <hi>Prieſts</hi> under the Law, ſo <hi>Goſpel-Ministers</hi> are not ſuffered to continue, by reaſon of Death.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They are mean, and lightly Eſteemed in the World.</hi> And in this reſpect may be compared
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001928_0021_0FBA263606CA01B0"/>to <hi>Earthen</hi> Veſſels. They are not ordinarily Men of Name and Renown. They are often eſteemed as <hi>Earthen Pitchers, the work of the hands of the Potter.</hi> They are too often filled with contempt, and caſt out as Veſſels where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is no pleaſure. 1 Cor. 4.13. <hi>We are made as the filth of the World, and are the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcouring of all things to this Day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I might have conſidered their Moral defects, and infirmities. The Miniſters of the Goſpel are Sinful Men. The beſt of them groan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the remains of the body of Death. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> uttered that heavy complaint, Rom. 7.24. <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this Death?</hi>

               <p>There is an Excellent Power which doth accompany the diſpenſation of the Goſpel, in the Salvation of Sinners.

Thoſe that Sat in darkneſs, and were Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually blind, have been enlighten'd: the dead have been made to hear the Voice of the Son of God and live. The Word of God is quick and powerful and ſharper than any two edged Sword piercing even to the dividing aſunder of the Soul and Spirit, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. Now God hath put this Treaſure into <hi>Earthen,</hi> Veſſels, committed the diſpenſation of his word to weak, frail, mortal Men, for this End, that the Excellency of the power might appear to be of God, and not of Men. That we might aſcribe the glory of this power unto Him to whom it doth appertain. The glorious Power of God doth appear and ſhine forth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In Strengthening them to hold and diſpenſe the Goſpel Treaſure, notwithſtanding the great Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition they meet with in the World.</hi> God's Power is ſeen in qualifying and furniſhing them for their work, and in upholding them in it. We may well cry out with the Apoſtle, <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi> 2 Cor. 2.16. The power of God doth appear in making his Strength perfect in their weakneſs, and <hi>His Grace Sufficient for them.</hi> The difficulties and hardſhips they encounter, are very great. Satan riſeth up as an Adverſary againſt them. And they meet with great Oppoſition from the Luſts and carnal Intereſts of Men. Many heavy Weights and Burdens ly upon them. They are
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001928_0023_0FBA26391AA84B88"/>Perſecuted for their work Sake many times, and that even to death. Now the glorious Power of Chriſt doth appear in ſuſtaining them under theſe Preſſures. Chriſt ordains to Himſelf Praiſe out of their Mouths, when He gives them a Mouth and Wiſdom which all their Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are not able to gainſay and reſiſt. The Power of Chriſt is ſeen when He makes theſe <hi>Earthen</hi> Veſſels as an Iron Pillar, and braſen Walls, againſt which the Powers of Darkneſs do ſight; but can't prevail. The Power of Chriſt is ſeen in Strengthening them to all Patience and Long-ſuffering under their heavy Trials.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In making ſuch weak Instruments Succeſsful in erecting and eſtabliſhing Chriſts Kingdom in the Hearts of Men.</hi> The Arm of the Lord is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Reveal'd when Men believe their Report. We read, 2 Cor. 10.4, 5. <hi>For the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal, but mighty brough God to the pulling down of ſtrong holds: Caſting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth it ſelf againſt the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.</hi> The glory of Chriſts Power is very conſpicuous in producing ſuch wonderful Effects by ſuch weak Inſtruments. When the Goſpel runs and is glorified in the Salvation of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; It is apparent that our Mighty Redeemer girds his Sword upon his thigh, with his Glory and his Majeſty. It appears to be the Day of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001928_0024_0FBA263ACF266330"/>His Power, when thoſe that were Enemies in their hearts, are made a willing People, and ſubdued to an Obedience to the Faith. It is evident that the Power whereby theſe wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and miraculous Works are wrought in the Kingdom of Grace, is not Humane, but Divine. And they that behold it muſt ſay, This is the Finger of God.</p>

His di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Care of his Flock, and Parental Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Students of the College, muſt not be forgotten.

               <p>It hath pleaſed the Holy GOD, in whoſe Hands our Times are, to lay this Congregation under the awful Rebukes of His Soveraign Providence by breaking an <hi>Earthen</hi> Veſſel in which He had laid up much Precious Treaſure, Treaſure with which we were enriched.</p>
               <p>We have a <hi>peculiar</hi> ſhare in the great Loſs which the Churches of Chriſt in this Land do thereby ſuſtain. It becomes us therefore to be humbled under the mighty Hand of God.</p>
               <p>In a particular manner, as I have eſpecial Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſo I deſire to be deeply humbled under this awful Blow, whereby much of our Strength and Beauty are conſumed.</p>
               <p>I am ſenſible how unfit I am to give ſo Great a Man His Character; And this hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done by Elder and much Abler Hands.</p>
               <p>However the Relation I ſtand in will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to be wholly Silent. Give me leave therefore to make ſome Eſſay to pay a Tribute to the Memory of the Deceaſed, whoſe Praiſe is in theſe Churches. I ſhall endeavour to do it with a ſincere aim at His Glory, who is the Father of
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001928_0033_0FBA265107828410"/>Lights from whom cometh down every good and perfect Giving.</p>

               <p>Might I preſume to look upon my ſelf as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judge of Learning, and Learned Men, I would ſay, He was a very great Proficient in the Study of the Liberal Arts and Sciences.</p>
               <p>He had a great Natural Capacity, a Large and Comprehenſive Genius. And by hard study and great Induſtry had amaſs'd a rich Treaſure of Learning. I ſuppoſe few in theſe Corners of the Earth have been better acquainted with Books and Men.</p>
               <p>He Read much, and had an Excellent Faculty of digeſting what he Read, and of making it his own. He had the Powers of Reaſorning and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing in an high Degree. He was a great Maſter of Speech, and was very happy in imparting his Sentiments to others. And we may now take up our Lamentation and ſay; <hi>Behold the Lord, the Lord of Hoſts, taketh away — The Prophet, and the Prudent, — And the Eloquent Oratour.</hi>

Theſe Rich Talents which His Lord beſtow'd freely upon him, he Conſecrated to the Work of the Miniſtry: and devoted to the Service of Chriſt in His Temple; to how good Purpoſe, ye are Witneſſes. He did not hide his Lords Talents in a Napkin; but Occupied with them, <hi>Labouring in the Word and Doctrine.</hi> He did Spend, and was Spent in his Maſters Service. He was an Able Miniſter of the New Teſtament; a Scribe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed to the Kingdom of Heaven; and brought forth out of his Treaſure things New and Old. He was highly eſteemed for the Pertinency, Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency, and Copiouſneſs of his Expreſſion in Prayer. His Diſcourſes were Elaborate. The Subjects of them were well Choſen, the Method was Accurate, the Style Strong and Maſculine. They were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently well ſuited to make his Auditors wiſer and better; and he Delivered them with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Fervour.</p>
               <p>I account it a great Favour of God that I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd the Benefit of his Miniſtry ſo long.</p>
               <p>His Deeds of Charity are now mentioned for a Memorial of him. The Lord grant that his Seed after him may be bleſſed!</p>
