            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.
      </p>
         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>ALMOST every one of theſe <hi>Eſſays</hi> was written above twenty Years ago, and ſome of them more than thirty. The Author finds Reaſon to offer his ſincere Acknowledgments and Thanks to Almighty God, who has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved him, even to this Day, in the ſame Sentiments and Principles of <hi>Chriſtian Faith and Love,</hi> amidſt the numerous Follies and Errors of the Times.</p>
            <p>One of theſe Papers indeed, found its way into the World the very Year in which it was written; the very Deſign of it was to exemplify the Title of this Book,
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:006440_0005_1028EF153AAB0B00"/>
and it has been often ſince ſollicited to be printed again: But it was delay'd for many Years, till the Author had formed a Collection of Papers of this Sort large enough to compoſe a moderate Volume; and the Reader will be ſufficiently inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the preſent Reaſon of this Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by a mere explaining of the Words of the Title, <q>Orthodoxy and Charity united.</q>
            </p>
            <p>By the Word <hi>Orthodoxy,</hi> the Author means all thoſe <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Doctrines which were generally approved in the laſt Age, ſo far as he knows at leaſt, by almoſt all the <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters</hi> in the Nation; even thoſe great Doctrines on which the <hi>Reformation</hi> from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was built; and they continued ſo all the time theſe <hi>Eſſays</hi> were writing, and long before, in the general good Eſteem of the Churches, as being conformable to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

is needleſs in this Place to reckon them all up particularly, but in general they were ſuch as theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By the Fall of the firſt Man, he, together with his Poſterity, loſt their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence and their Immortality, their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were ſubjected to Diſeaſes and Death, their natural Inclinations were perverted from that which is good, and there was a ſtrange prevailing Biaſs in human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, even from its Infancy, to that which in Evil.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In order to their Recovery from this Ruin, there is not only a Neceſſity of the Pardon of their Sins, and Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation of their Perſons to God, but there is need alſo that their ſinful Natures be healed, and renewed by ſanctifying Grace, in order to reſtore Men to Virtue and Piety, <hi>i. e.</hi> to the Love of God and their Fellow-Creatures.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:006440_0007_1028EF1946B2EB88"/>3. The Son of God, who in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Scripture is <hi>one with the Father,</hi> came down from Heaven to take Fleſh, and therein to fulfil the Duties of the Law, and give an Example of perfect Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs: And then he was appointed to ſuffer Death as a Sacrifice and Atonement for the Sins of Men, that Mankind might thereby obtain Pardon and the Favour of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. There is a Neceſſity alſo that Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſhould heartily repent of their Sins, return to God, and be renew'd to the Principles and Temper of Holineſs, in order to their complete Recovery to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life and Happineſs.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Beſides this Repentance and Return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, it is alſo required that they believe in the Name of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> their Saviour, or truſt in him with a humble Expectation of the Favour of God through him: And 'tis through this Faith they
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:006440_0008_1028EF1BA5375BE8"/>
are to be juſtified and accepted of God.</p>
            <p n="6">6. They are alſo obliged to obey the Law of God, as far as this feeble and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect State admits of, during their whole Life, and ſtill to grow up towards Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therein.</p>
            <p n="7">7. When ſuch Perſons die, their Souls are convey'd to a State of Peace and Reſt in the Preſence of God, till the great Day of the Reſurrection, when their Bodies ſhall riſe again from the Dead, and the whole Perſon, Body and Soul, be made happy for ever in the Favour and Preſence of God their Maker.</p>
            <p>Theſe Doctrines were generally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd at the time of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> by <hi>Proteſtants</hi> abroad and at home, and theſe are the Sett of Principles which have been uſually called <hi>Orthodoxy</hi> or right Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="viii" facs="unknown:006440_0009_1028EF1D2F295188"/>Now it has unhappily fallen out, that many of thoſe who have received and profeſs'd theſe important Doctrines, have differ'd alſo in many leſſer Points, ſuch as the <hi>Logical</hi> Relations of ſome of theſe Doctrines to one another, that is, <hi>Whether Faith or Works</hi> be <hi>Conditions or Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of their Juſtification and Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; what is the eſſential Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Covenant of Works and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace,</hi> or the <hi>Law and the Goſpel,</hi> &amp;c. as well as in ſeveral particular Practices of <hi>divine Worſhip,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, Veſtures, impoſed Forms of Prayer,</hi> &amp;c. and they have ſo far quarrelled about theſe Things as too much to neglect and abandon that <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Love and Charity they ought to have maintained, according to their general Acknowledgement of the great and neceſſary Truths and Rules of Chriſtianity, and hereby they have in many Inſtances loſt that Duty and Character of good <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> (viz.) to <hi>Love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ix" facs="unknown:006440_0010_1028EF205FB1A1D8"/>Now ſince theſe unhappy and unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Practices, even amongſt ſome good Men, have prevail'd even to this Day, it is the Deſign of theſe <hi>Eſſays</hi> to endeavour the Recovery of theſe Perſons, who unite in theſe Principles, to charitable Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Practices towards one another.</p>
            <p>Here it will be very natural to enquire, Where is there found amongſt all theſe <hi>Eſſays,</hi> any Attempt to reconcile thoſe to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Love and Charity of others, who while they profeſs the <hi>Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> yet oppoſe, renounce or deny the great Doctrines of the atoning Sacrifice of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or his Propitiation for Sin by his Death?</p>
            <p>All the Anſwer that can be given is this: The Author would gladly have done it, that the whole Book might be of a Piece, and every Page might overflow with Love, if he could, after the turning over his New Teſtament, have met with
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:006440_0011_1028EF23F2674260"/>
any evident Inſtances, or Examples, any plain Rules or Requirements of ſuch <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> Charity expreſſed towards Perſons of this Character in all the ſacred Writings.</p>
            <p>But the Language of Scripture gives no Encouragement to ſuch a Charity; for this Doctrine is not any where number'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the doubtful Diſputables of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the leſſer Things of Chriſtianity, ſuch as <hi>Meats</hi> and <hi>Drinks,</hi> and Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Days,</hi> and <hi>outward Forms</hi> of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; but it is ſpoken of as a matter of far higher Importance, and I think ſeems to be neceſſary to conſtitute <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> itſelf.</p>
            <p>This Doctrine contains in it the higheſt and the kindeſt Deſign toward Men, for which our bleſſed Saviour came down from Heaven; 'twas for this very Reaſon he came into this World, (<hi>viz.) to give his Life a Ranſom for</hi> Sinners, <hi>Matth.</hi> xx. 28. and 'tis repeated in <hi>Mark</hi> x. 45. So that
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:006440_0012_1028EF269C22FCD8"/>
thoſe who depart from and renounce this Article, renounce the kindeſt Deſign of the Coming and the Death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and they ſeem, by the Words of the holy Writings, to be expoſed to another ſort of Sentence, from which may the Grace of God recover and preſerve them!</p>
            <p>In the mean time, I hope thoſe who heartily unite in their Sentiments of theſe great Doctrines which I have mentioned, and maintain a correſpondent Practice of ſtrict Holineſs and Dependance upon <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> our great High-Prieſt, and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, will be taught by ſome of theſe Papers, to learn the Duties of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Love more perfectly, agreeable to the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Deſign of the holy Founder of our Religion.</p>
            <p>It ſhould be obſerved here, that though the chief part of theſe <hi>Eſſays</hi> were written at the time which is mention'd, yet there happen to be now and then a few Lines
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:006440_0013_1028EF2826BBE0D8"/>
or Pages, and ſome few Citations from el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or later Authors, which were not all written or inſerted at that time.</p>
            <p>Let it be obſerved alſo, that all the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters here mentioned are general and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite; and there is not one Character or Name, that is now written in theſe Papers, or ever was, that was deſign'd to be apply'd to any particular Perſon: For the Author avoided it with Care in all theſe Writings, and in all his Reviews of them, that no ſingle Perſon whatſoever ſhould be ſo particularly deſcribed, as to imagine himſelf to be intended, and much leſs to be diſtinguiſhed by any Reader. May the divine Bleſſing attend every hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Attempt to eſtabliſh the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith, and to confirm and enlarge our Love. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>THE Word, <hi>Goſpel,</hi> is uſed in more Senſes than one. Sometimes it ſignifies the Hiſtory of the Life and Doctrine, the Death and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt. So <hi>Mark</hi> i. 1. <hi>The Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Goſpel of Jeſus Christ the Son of God.</hi> And ſo 'tis uſed in common Speech, when we call the Writings of the four Evangeliſts <hi>the four Goſpels.</hi> But in the moſt proper and uſual Senſe of it in Scripture, it ſignifies a <hi>Diſcovery of Divine Mercy, through a Mediator, to Mankind fallen into Sin and Miſery</hi>; therefore in <hi>Greek</hi> it is called <hi>Evaggelion,</hi> or <hi>Glad Tidings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Name indeed, as derived from its <hi>Saxon</hi> Original, ſignifies only the <hi>Word of God</hi>: Yet it is now peculiarly applied to the <hi>Word of his Grace,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals Salvation to ſinful and miſerable Man, and therefore it is often called the <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb n="2" facs="unknown:006440_0017_1028EF3263AB5518"/>This Salvation is made up of many Benefits or Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, Part of which are beſtowed in this World, and the reſt in the World that is to come. The Revelation of theſe Benefits, and of the Foundation on which they ſtand, and of the Way whereby we come to be Partakers of them, is the <hi>Matter, Sum</hi> and <hi>Subſtance</hi> of the Goſpel, in its moſt general Notion among Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>This Goſpel was not revealed all at once in its full Glory to Mankind. There have been ſeveral Editions of it, or gradual Diſcoveries of this Grace in all the former Ages of the World.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as ever <hi>Adam</hi> had ſinned, and ruined himſelf and his Poſterity too, by laying the Foundation of their Sin and Miſery, it pleaſed God to publiſh this Goſpel by the Promiſe of a Saviour, when he told our Mother <hi>Eve,</hi> that <hi>her Seed ſhould bruiſe the Head of the Serpent</hi> that had deceived her, <hi>Gen.</hi> iii. 15. This, by our Divines, is uſually called <hi>the firſt Goſpel</hi>; for, in the modern Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the New Teſtament it ſignifies, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt ſhould come into this World to deſtroy the Works of the Devil,</hi> 1 John iii. 8.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſs <hi>Noah,</hi> the ſecond Father of Mankind, had ſome farther Diſcoveries made to him, when the Rainbow was appointed as the Seal of a gracious Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and Man: For the very Promiſe of the Continuance of the comfortable Seaſons of the Year, being given to Man in a Way of Mercy, do imply that God would not be irreconcileable to his fallen Creatures. Nor can we reaſonably ſuppoſe but that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> and all thoſe moſt ancient Patriarchs, had larger Explications and Comments of the firſt Promiſe given them than <hi>Moſes</hi> has recorded.</p>
               <p>This Goſpel was renewed by Revelations made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> when the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the Saviour, was pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

the <hi>Goſpel, Gal.</hi> iii. 8. There was alſo a Type or Pattern of our Juſtification by Faith in the Way of the Goſpel, when <hi>Abraham believed God</hi> in his Promiſes, and <hi>it was imputed to him for Righteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. v. 3.</p>

                  <hi>Moſes</hi> had a much larger Diſcovery of the Grace and Mercy of God toward ſinful Man made to him, and to the <hi>Jews</hi> by him, than all the Patriarchs put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And this was not only done in the Types, and Figures, and Ceremonies, not only in Altars, Sacrifices, Waſhings, Sprinklings, Purifications, and in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption from <hi>Egypt,</hi> their miraculous Salvations in the Wilderneſs, and their ſafe Conduct to <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Land of promiſed Reſt; but he had many literal and expreſs Revelations of pardoning and ſanctifying Grace, which are ſcattered up and down in the five Books which he wrote, and which he gave to the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to direct their Religion. This is alſo called <hi>the Goſpel,</hi> Heb. iv. 2. <hi>To them was the Goſpel preached as well as unto us,</hi> as thoſe Words ought to be tranſlated. This ſame Goſpel was afterward confirmed, illuſtrated and enlarged by ſucceeding <hi>Prophets</hi> in the ſeveral Ages of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>But <hi>God, who at ſundry Times and in divers Manners ſpoke</hi> this Goſpel <hi>to our Fathers by the Prophets, has in theſe later Days</hi> publiſhed the ſame to us in a brighter Manner, <hi>by his Son Jeſus,</hi> the promiſed Saviour, <hi>Heb.</hi> i. 1 And ſince the Death and Reſurrection of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Apoſtles being ſent by their exalted Lord, have given yet plainer and fuller Declarations of this Goſpel to the Children of Men.</p>
               <p>And upon this Account it is ſeveral Times called the <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> not only becauſe the Offices and Grace of <hi>Chriſt</hi> run through the whole of it, but alſo becauſe the cleareſt Diſcoveries of it are made to the World by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and by his Meſſengers the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>Now, from this laſt and fulleſt Revelation of it in
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:006440_0019_1028EF3679DDF318"/>
the New Teſtament, we may derive a fuller and more perfect Knowledge of the Goſpel than all the former Ages could attain. Hereby we learn, that the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is a <hi>Promiſe of Salvation from Sin and Hell, by the Death, Righteouſneſs and Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to every one that is ſincerely willing to accept of it by coming to Chriſt, or truſting in him</hi>; and it includes alſo <hi>the promiſed Aid of the Holy Spirit to thoſe who ſeek it, to enable them to receive this Salvation, and to fit them for the final Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the promiſed Glory.</hi> It includes alſo the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the future Reſurrection, the laſt Judgment and eternal Life.</hi> To this End did the <hi>Son of God come into the World, that whoſoever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>elieves on him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting Life,</hi> John iii. 16.</p>
               <p>This may be made out and explained more at large in the following Manner.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Salvation</hi> which the Goſpel propoſes, is exactly anſwerable to our preſent State of Sin and Wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and fully ſupplies all the Neceſſities of fallen Man, his Guilt and deſerved Miſery, his ſinful and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Nature, and his utter Inability to help himſelf; and therefore it muſt contain in it Holineſs and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with divine Directions and divine Aids in order to attain them. The <hi>Happineſs</hi> of it is a Freedom from that Death and Puniſhment which we had incurred by Sin, and a Recovery to the Favour of God which we had loſt, and everlaſting Joy therein. The <hi>Holineſs</hi> of it is the Image of God in which we were at firſt created, which Image was defaced and ruined by Man's firſt Tranſgreſſion.</p>
               <p>The Foundation of this Salvation is the eternal Mercy and Goodwill of God the Father, to his poor, periſhing, ſinful Creatures, by the glorious Undertaking and various Tranſactions and Offices of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt as Mediator, and the ſeveral Operations of the Bleſſed Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="unknown:006440_0020_1028EF3ADAD6D598"/>This Salvation, in the whole of it, is contrived and appointed by the various Attributes of God, eſpecially his Wiſdom, Power and Goodneſs, exerting themſelves for this Purpoſe: 'Tis purchaſed or procured for us by the Death and Sufferings of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> 'Tis applied to us by the Work of the Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>We are choſen to partake of all this Salvation, both the Holineſs and Happineſs of it, by the eternal Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will of the Father. We are recovered to the Favour of God, and Happineſs, by the Obedience or Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, <hi>the Death and Interceſſion of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who is the Son of God in our Nature. We are reſtored to the Image of God and Holineſs by the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> that is promiſed and ſent down into this World, to change our Hearts and reform our Lives, and thereby fit us for the heavenly Happineſs.</p>
               <p>But what are we to do that we may become Partakers of this Salvation? For it is not every Son and Daughter of <hi>Adam</hi> who are Poſſeſſors of it. Now it is the Goſpel that reveals this to us, and alſo <hi>directs</hi> us in it. The appointed Way to partake of this Salvation is by <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving or Truſting in Chriſt;</hi> that is, when from a deep Senſe of the Evil of Sin, and our Guilt and Danger on that Account, we grow weary and heavy laden with the Burden of our Sins, and ſurrender or betruſt ourſelves to the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that by his Death and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence we may be ſaved from Hell, and be accepted unto eternal Life, and that by the <hi>divine Aid</hi> of his Spirit, we may have all the ſinful Powers of our Natures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and ſanctified, and fitted for that Life eternal which <hi>Chriſt</hi> has purchaſed. Thus you ſee this Grace of Faith neceſſarily draws along with it ſincere Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for Sin, and Deſires after true Holineſs.</p>
               <p>When we conſider that we are by Nature afar off from God, ignorant and averſe to all that is holy, we ſhall find that we are not more able to believe unto
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006440_0021_1028DAD1D4A9DF08"/>
Salvation, nor to repent of Sin, at firſt, than we are to perform Works of Holineſs afterwards. Therefore this Goſpel provides us with divine Strength to fulfil theſe Duties; <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>our Strength,</hi> as well as <hi>our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> He is <hi>exalted to beſtow Repentance</hi> as well as <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs</hi>; and <hi>Faith is the Gift of God, who creates us anew in Chriſt Jeſus unto good Works,</hi> Iſa. xlv. Acts v. Eph. ii. and makes us holy by his Spirit, as is before expreſt. 'Tis by the Holy Spirit conſidered eminently as the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> that we are enabled to receive this Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation at firſt, and trained up and prepared for the full Poſſeſſion of it.</p>
               <p>It is further alſo comprehended in this <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and promiſed in this <hi>gracious Conſtitution of God,</hi> that when we have finiſhed our State of Trial on Earth, our Souls ſhall be received at Death into the Preſence and Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God; and our Bodies alſo ſhall be raiſed from the Grave in the great Reſurrection Day, and thus our whole Natures ſhall be made happy together to all Eternity.</p>
               <p>This is the <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Subject</hi> of the gracious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of God, this the <hi>Method of Salvation,</hi> and the Manner of our partaking of it, which is appointed by God himſelf, and this is what I call the <hi>Subſtance of the Goſpel.</hi> There are ſome other Points of Importance that belong to it, but this is the Foundation of all, and comprehenſive of the reſt.</p>
               <p>To ſum up the ſeveral Parts of it in as few Words as I can, <hi>the Goſpel of Chriſt</hi> is a gracious Conſtitution of God for the Recovery of ſinful Man, by ſending his own Son in the Fleſh to obey his Law, which Man had broken, to make a proper Atonement for Sin by his Death, and to procure the Favour of God, and eternal Happineſs for all that believe and repent and receive this offered Salvation, together with a Promiſe of the Holy Spirit to work this Faith and Repentance in the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006440_0022_1028EF3FC7AD1A68"/>
Hearts of Men, to renew their ſinful Natures unto Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, to form them fit for this Happineſs on Earth, and to bring them to the full Poſſeſſion of it in Heaven.</p>
               <p>All this is ſo evident from a Variety of Scriptures that might be cited here, that one would think there ſhould be no need to prove it. But there have been ſome Perſons in the laſt and in the prefect Age (I chiefly intend the <hi>Socinian</hi> Writers, and thoſe <hi>nominal Chriſtians</hi> who are leaning toward <hi>Deiſm</hi>) who would impoveriſh and curtail the <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> and make it to conſiſt in little more than mere <hi>natural Religion.</hi> Some of theſe Perſons juſt make a Shift to perſuade themſelves to believe the <hi>Bible,</hi> or at leaſt they profeſs to believe it, becauſe it is the Religion of their Country, but they explain it in ſo poor, ſo narrow, ſo dry, and inſipid a Manner as raiſes it very little above the <hi>Light of Nature,</hi> viz. <q>That if we follow the Dictates of our inward Reaſon and our Conſcience, in worſhipping God, and in loving our Neighbours, according to the Rules which Scripture hath given us to explain and confirm the Light of Nature, and herein imitate the holy Example of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> then our Sins ſhall be forgiven us by the meer Mercy of God, through the Supplication and Interceſſion of ſo good a Man as <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and we ſhall be accepted to eternal Life;</q> and this without any Dependance on the <hi>Death of Chriſt</hi> as a proper Atonement or Satisfaction for Sin, or any Regard to him as a true and real Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. And as for the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> and his Almighty Operation on the Souls of Men, to enlighten and ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify them, at leaſt in our Age, this is almoſt baniſhed out of their Goſpel, and finds but little room in their Religion.</p>
               <p>I think it neceſſary therefore to prove, that the <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt</hi> is ſuch a Doctrine as I have deſcribed; and that I ſhall do by theſe five Reaſons.</p>

               <p n="1">I. This Doctrine, which I have now mentioned, of the Reſtoration of Believers in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to the Favour of God, by the atoning Sacrifice and Obedience of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the renewing of ſinful Men to God's Image by the Work of the Holy Spirit, and thereby bringing them to eternal Life, is the very Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>it is the very Labour and Buſineſs, the chief Scope, Aim and Deſign of the great Apoſtle of the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>in thoſe of his Epiſtles where he ſets himſelf profeſſedly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the Goſpel; and this is what he takes frequent Occaſion alſo to bring into all his Writings.</hi> It is his perpetual Labour to inſtruct the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> in theſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and unknown Truths: He uſes various Forms of Speech to explain them to their Underſtandings; for <q>
                     <hi>I deſire,</hi> ſaith he, and <hi>determine to know nothing among you but</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>and him crucified, i. e.</hi> nothing like it; nothing in Compariſon with it.

                  </q> Rom. i. 16. 1 Cor. i. 24. <hi>and</hi> ii. 2.</p>
               <p>You find his Letters to the Churches full of ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions as theſe, <hi>Chriſt died for our Sins. He gave himſelf for us to redeem us from all Iniquity. We have Redemption thro' his Blood. God was in Chriſt reconciling the World to himſelf, not imputing their Treſpaſſes to them. He was made Sin, and a Curſe for us. He is our Propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi> and <hi>Atonement. He appeared to put away Sin by the Sacrifice of himſelf. When we were Enemies we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God by his Death. He made Peace by the Blood of his Croſs. He was delivered for our Offences, and raiſed again for our Juſtification. By the Righteouſneſs of one Man the free Gift came upon all Men to Juſtification of

Life. By the Obedience of one, ſhall many be made Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous; and we are juſtify'd by Faith in him. He teaches us alſo the Offices of the Holy Spirit. We have Acceſs to God thro' his Spirit. We are purified and ſanctified by the Spirit.</hi> 'Tis <hi>by the Spirit of Chriſt that</hi> we are to <hi>mortify the Deeds of the Fleſh. We are led by the Spirit</hi>; and we are <hi>taught</hi> to underſtand this Goſpel <hi>by the Spirit which he hath given us. We are ſealed by this Spirit unto the Day of Redemption. The Spirit dwelling in us</hi> is a Pledge and <hi>Earneſt</hi> of our <hi>Inheritance in Heaven.</hi> Rom. viii. 13. Epheſ. ii. 18. <hi>and</hi> iii. 16. <hi>and</hi> iv. 23. 2 Theſ. ii. 13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now theſe Expreſſions of his are to be underſtood in the common Senſe and Meaning of the Words, and not as far-fetch'd Metaphors; for it is evident, that in all this he does not affect the Arts of Oratory, nor aſſume a magnificent Air, of Writing, nor does he raiſe himſelf into Sublimities of Style, nor rove in an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtick Way, when he treats of theſe Subjects; but while he is explaining to us theſe great Things of the Goſpel, he avoids <hi>the Wiſdom of Words</hi> and Oratory, and he talks in a plain rational, and argumentative Method to inform the Minds of Men, and give them the cleareſt Knowledge of the Truth.</p>
               <p>Surely a Perſon that was ſent of God to preach and write the Goſpel for the Uſe of all Nations and future Ages, and even for the ignorant and uninſtructed <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,</hi> would not have expreſſed himſelf in this ſort of Language, if he meant no more by it than the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians</hi> do by the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt</hi>; that is, <q>that the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was a very great Man, but a mere Man ſtill; he was a Prophet ordained of God to preach up Holineſs in greater Degrees than it had been before preached, to ſettle ſome Points which were left a little doubtful by the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to aſſure us that God would be reconciled to Man, and forgive him, if Man repented and was
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:006440_0025_1028EF46AC8EE410"/>
ſorry for his Sins, and lived as well as he could for time to come; and that for the Sake of the Prayers of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who was ſo very pious, ſo very religious and ſo very heavenly a Perſon, and ſo ſubmiſſive in his Sufferings to the Will of God, he would favour the Penitent among Mankind with ſome Bleſſings and Comforts in this World, and eternal Life in the World above. Then when he had preached this Doctrine to the World, he ſuffer'd the Death of the Croſs, to bear witneſs to the Truth of it, and ſeal'd it with his Blood, and roſe again for a further Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the ſame Doctrine.</q> Now if this were all the meaning of the <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> would never have preached it in ſuch Language as he did. We muſt ſuppoſe him to be a very unaccurate Writer, a moſt unintelligible Preacher and a moſt unfit Man to be made an Apoſtle, and be ſent to inſtruct the ignorant World, if he had expreſſed himſelf in ſuch myſterious, figurative, and ſtrange Phraſes, and all this while had meant no more by them than what the <hi>Socinians</hi> mean by their Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Can we think God would have employed ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument as this was, whoſe Way of Talking would have rather deceived Multitudes than informed them of the Truth, would have led them into the Dark rather than have given them Light, would have filled their Heads with myſterious Words without Ideas, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of leading them into the Way of Salvation, would have left them in bewildered Thoughts about the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines and Duties of it with ſo much Entanglement and Confuſion?</p>
               <p>Here I might add alſo, that the holy Apoſtle not only inſtructs his own Countrymen the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the <hi>Gentile</hi> Strangers in this divine Doctrine, and teaches them to build their Hopes of Salvation upon it; but <hi>he ventures his own Soul, his immortal Concernments, and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:006440_0026_1028EF48770AFCF8"/>
his everlaſting Hopes upon the ſame Foundation.</hi> He <hi>glories in the Croſs of Chriſt,</hi> he has <hi>committed his All</hi> into his Hands <hi>till the great</hi> Judgment <hi>Day; he lives by the Faith of the Son of God, who loved me,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and gave himſelf for me,</hi> Gal. vi. 14. 2 Tim. i. 12. Gal. ii. 20. 'Tis the Pleaſure of his Tongue, 'tis the Joy of his Pen, 'tis the Delight and the Life of his Spirit to talk of thoſe Things: He hangs upon this Subject, and knows not how to leave it; his very Heart and Soul is in it, and he abandons all Things for the Sake of this Knowledge. He deſpiſes the former Privileges of his Birth, of his Learning, of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Prerogatives and Rites. He renounces all his Legal and Ceremonial Perfection, and all his Honour amongſt the Prieſts and the Phariſees in Compariſon of this. <hi>What Things were Gain to me,</hi> ſays he, <hi>thoſe I count Loſs for</hi> Chriſt: <hi>Yea, doubtleſs, and I count all Things but Loſs for the Excellency of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of</hi> Chriſt Jeſus <hi>my Lord, for whom I have ſuffered the Loſs of all Things, and do count them but Dung that I may win</hi> Chriſt, <hi>and be found in him, not having mine own Righteouſneſs, which is of the Law, but that which is through the Faith of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>the Righteouſneſs which is of God by Faith; that I may know him and the Power of his Reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Fellowſhip of his Sufferings, being made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable unto his Death,</hi> Philip. iii. 7, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Nor is the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſingular in this Reſpect, or different in his Sentiments from the other Apoſtles. You find <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> ſaying the ſame Things in their Epiſtles; and they take every Occaſion to publiſh the ſame Goſpel and the ſame Promiſes and Hopes of Salvation by the Death and Sacrifice of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and by the enlightening and ſanctifying Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſame <hi>Spirit.</hi> It would be endleſs to cite all the Proofs of this. Now, 'tis not to be ſuppoſed that the three chief Writers among the Apoſtles ſhould all conſpire to talk in the ſame myſterious and unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:006440_0027_1028EF4A0AA90100"/>
Language, ſo widely different from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and obvious Senſe and Meaning of their Words, if they intended no more by them than the <hi>Socinians</hi> mean by their <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which is very little different from the Way of Salvation that the <hi>Deiſt</hi> propoſes, while they deny the <hi>Satisfaction of Chriſt,</hi> and his real and proper <hi>Atonement for Sin,</hi> and the powerful <hi>ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Influences</hi> of the Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p n="2">II. As this Goſpel of Chriſt which we have deſcribed, was the Labour of the Apoſtle's Miniſtry, and the Deſign of the Revelation of the New Teſtament, ſo 'tis this Goſpel which is often hinted and prophecied in the Old Teſtament alſo, and typified by the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the <hi>Jewiſh Religion.</hi> Now theſe Prophecies could not have been fulfilled, nor theſe Types anſwered and accompliſhed without ſuch a Goſpel as I have explained.</p>
               <p>The Prophecies of the Old Teſtament are various and many: Some of the cleareſt of thoſe which relate to the Sufferings and Atonement of Chriſt, and to our Juſtification by him, are expreſt by <hi>Daniel, Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah.</hi> By <hi>Daniel</hi> we are told that the <hi>Meſſiah ſhall he cut off, but not for himſelf,</hi> and the Deſign of this is <hi>to finiſh Tranſgreſſion, to make an End of Sin,</hi> to make <hi>Reconciliation for Iniquities,</hi> and to <hi>bring in everlaſting Righteouſneſs,</hi> Daniel ix. 24, 26. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks the ſame thing more largely, Chriſt <hi>was wounded for our Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions. He was bruiſed for our Iniquities. The Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Peace was upon him,</hi> and <hi>by his Stripes we are healed. We like Sheep have gone aſtray, and the Lord hath laid on him the Iniquity of us all. It pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him and put him to Grief, and to make his Soul an Offering for Sin.</hi> By the Knowledge <hi>of him ſhall he juſtify many, for he ſhall bear their Iniquities.</hi> How ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding plain and ſtrong is this Language to ſupport this Doctrine. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> liii. 5, 6, 10, 11. <hi>In the Lord ſhall
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:006440_0028_1028EF5056221F58"/>
we have Righteouſneſs and Strength: In the Lord ſhall all the Seed of</hi> Iſrael <hi>be juſtified and ſhall glory,</hi> Iſaiah xlv. 24, 25. And the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> expreſly calls <hi>Chriſt the Lord our Righteouſneſs,</hi> Jerem. xxiii. 6.</p>
               <p>The Promiſe of Sanctification by the Spirit of God, is given us in <hi>Ezek.</hi> xxxvi. 26, 27. <hi>A new Heart will I give you, and a new Spirit will I put within you; I will put my Spirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my Statutes, and ye ſhall be my People and I will be your God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſort of Language is repeated <hi>Chap.</hi> xi. 19. and <hi>Jerem.</hi> xxxii. 39, 40. <hi>Jerem.</hi> xxxi. 31, 32, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is cited by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtles to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> as the Language of the Goſpel, or the new Covenant. Now it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt enough, that all theſe Expreſſions of glorious Grace, and of the Method of our Reconciliation to God, our Sanctification and Salvation could never be anſwered and accompliſhed without ſuch a Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt</hi> as we have deſcribed.</p>
               <p>The Rights and Ceremonies of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church ſpeak the ſame thing, if we conſider them as Types and Figures of the Goſpel-ſtate. I will grant indeed that many of thoſe Ceremonies had alſo ſome other Intendments (<hi>viz.</hi>) to diſtinguiſh the Nation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and their Religion, from the <hi>Gentile</hi> World, and the fantaſtical Inventions of <hi>Pagan</hi> Worſhip: To keep them in Subjection to God as their political Head or King: Several of their Sacrifices and Methods of Purification were appointed to cleanſe them from ceremonial De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filements, and to atone for Civil or Political Crimes, whereby they were admitted to their Civil Rights again, and their Place in the Congregation, when they had done any thing to forfeit them.</p>
               <p>But 'tis evident by the Writings of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> Chap. iii. <hi>Gal.</hi> Chap. iv. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> Chap. ii. <hi>Heb.</hi> Chap. vii, viii, ix, x. that the great End of theſe <hi>Jewiſh</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="unknown:006440_0029_1028EF53256D38F8"/>
ceremonial Appointments was to ſtand as Types and Figures of things under the Goſpel, and Emblems of the various Offices and Benefits of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Now in this figurative or Emblematical Senſe, what did all the Sacrifices and the Blood mean, the burning Beaſts and the ſmoaking Altars, whereby the <hi>Jews</hi> made a typical Atonement for their Sins? What were they Tyes of, what did they repreſent, if not the Sacrifice of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> And what means the ſprinkling all the People with the Blood of Animals, if theſe things did not ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pify and repreſent our being cleanſed by the Blood of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which is therefore called the <hi>Blood of ſprinkling,</hi> and which is the only real and ſubſtantial Atonement for Sin? What meant their laying the Hand upon the Goat that was to bear their Iniquities, and the Confeſſion of the Sins of all <hi>Iſrael</hi> over his Head, if they did not deſign to foretel the transferring of the Sins of Men upon the Head of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the Surety and the Sacrifice for Sinners? What did the Waſhings of Water imply, but the pouring out of the Holy Spirit upon ſinful Men, and the Purification of their Natures by Divine Grace? Why did that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and divine Light dwell in the Tabernacle and in the Temple, and between the <hi>Cherubims</hi> in the Holy of Holies, if it were not an Emblem of the <hi>Fulneſs of the Godhead dwelling bodily</hi> in the Man <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> in and by whom God was to converſe viſibly with the Children of Men? Can any Man be ſo abſurd as to believe, in Oppoſition to ſo many Expreſſions of the Apoſtle in his Letters, that theſe Sprinklings of Water and of Blood, theſe bleeding Lambs and burning Goats and Bullocks, theſe Vails, Curtains and Tabernacles ſerved for nothing elſe but to wrap up the Duties of the Light of Nature in them, and to explain (or rather to darken) the common Truths of natural Religion? And yet the Apoſtle tells us in ſeveral Places, that theſe were Types

                  <hi>or Figures</hi> of the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Surely every Shadow bore the Shape and Figure of the Subſtance: Every Vail and Covering was fitted to the Body. All theſe were but <hi>Shadows,</hi> but <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>Subſtance</hi> or the <hi>Body,</hi> and the Shape of the Body appeared therein to thoſe that had divine Light to diſcern it, and eſpecially to us, whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> has taught to underſtand many of theſe Myſteries.</p>
               <p>Thoſe therefore who impoveriſh the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as ſome Writers have done, and deny thoſe glorious Doctrines that are included in it, they deny that Goſpel which was foretold by the Prophets, that Goſpel which was hidden in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Shadows, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to ſee it, though it be now broken forth into open Light.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt</hi> muſt needs be ſuch a Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine as we have before deſcribed, it muſt needs be ſo far ſuperior to all the Dictates of the Light of Nature, and to deſerve thoſe glorious Characters which the Apoſtle frequently gives it, (<hi>viz.</hi>) That it is the <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God in a Myſtery,</hi> 1 Cor. ii. 7. <hi>The great Myſtery of Godlineſs,</hi> 1 Tim. iii. 16.

                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:006440_0031_1028EF57D860A578"/>Now ſuch ſort of Deſcriptions as theſe are very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to the Doctrine of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> who is alſo <hi>one with the Father,</hi> and who is <hi>God bleſſed for evermore,</hi> coming down to join himſelf to Fleſh and Blood that he might be able to die in the room and ſtead of ſinful Men, and that this glorious Perſon, <hi>by whom the Worlds were made,</hi> and all the Hoſts of Men and Angels, <hi>Col.</hi> i. 15. that he ſhould be made a Sacrifice for our Sins, that God might declare his unſpotted Holineſs, or Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, his terrible Juſtice, and his unchangeable hatred of Sin, even <hi>while he forgives</hi> Sinners, and <hi>juſtifies thoſe that believe in Jeſus,</hi> Rom. iii. 24, 25. and that this Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> in human Nature ſhould riſe from the Dead, aſcend to Heaven, be exalted to the <hi>Government of all things viſible and inviſible,</hi> Eph. i. 22, 23. ſhould ſend his Spirit down to work Faith, Repentance and Holineſs in all his choſen and redeemed ones, and carry them through a thouſand Temptations and Difficulties, and through Death itſelf to Heaven and Glory. This is the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine that human Reaſon could never have found out, and has much ado to be perſuaded to receive it now it is manifeſted in the New Teſtament. Theſe are Wonders of unſearchable Wiſdom, and an Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for prying Angels.</p>
               <p>But if the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſignify no more than the mere Promiſe of Pardon to thoſe that Repent of their Sins, and believe <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to be a true Prophet, and follow the Example and Commands of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who has explained and confirmed the Light of Nature, what is there in this that deſerves ſuch a Catalogue of glorious Titles as the Apoſtle beſtows upon this Goſpel? There's no ſuch great and deep Contrivance, ſuch aſtoniſhing Wiſdom in ſuch a Covenant of Grace, as does nothing elſe but abate the ſevere and rigid Terms of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, and make Repentance and imperfect Obedience to ſerve inſtead of perfect Obedience, in order to obtain Pardon and Happineſs.</p>

                  <pb n="17" facs="unknown:006440_0032_1028EF5AB3E37280"/>I confeſs there was need of ſome divine Revelation to aſſure us that God would accept of our Repentances and our honeſt Endeavours, when in his Law he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands Perfection. But this any common Prophet might have done, being ſent of God and ſupported by Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, as <hi>Elijah</hi> and <hi>Eliſha</hi> were. And when once this Doctrine was thus plainly revealed, there would be no great Difficulty to perſuade Men to receive it, there are no ſuch ſublime Myſteries and Depths of Wiſdom and Knowledge contained in it; nor does it need any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary <hi>Genius,</hi> much leſs Divine Wiſdom itſelf, to have been the Inventor of it.</p>
               <p>But far be it from us to have ſuch a diminiſhing Thought of the glorious <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. Another Reaſon that I ſhall give to prove that the <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt</hi> is ſuch a Doctrine as I have before deſcribed, is the Opinion both of the <hi>Jews and Gentiles</hi> concerning it, and the Treatment that it met with both in <hi>Judea</hi> and amongſt the Nations.</p>
               <p>'Twas counted <hi>Fooliſhneſs by the</hi> Greeks, or the learned <hi>Heathens,</hi> and it was a <hi>Stone of ſtumbling to the</hi> Jews. We <hi>preach Chriſt crucified to the</hi> Jews a <hi>ſtumbling Block, and to the</hi> Greeks <hi>Fooliſhneſs,</hi> 1 Cor. i. 23. Whereas if the Doctrine of <hi>Chriſt</hi> crucified had implied no more in it than this, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> by his Death and Martyrdom on the Croſs, bore a Teſtimony to the Truth of the Doctrine which he preached, and that Doctrine was nothing elſe but a Diſcovery of God's Readineſs to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Sinners that repented and obeyed him, as well as they could, out of his mere Mercy; the <hi>Jews</hi> could never have been ſo much ſhocked or offended at it, for they believed as much as this long before St. <hi>Paul</hi> ever preach'd: Nor could the learned <hi>Greeks</hi> have counted that Doctrine <hi>Folly</hi> which the wiſeſt of their Philoſophers ſeemed to underſtand and teach. This ſort of Goſpel would have been ſo little different from
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:006440_0033_1028EF5D49268F50"/>
what the Light of Nature might lead them probably to expect and hope for, that ſurely they would not have endeavoured to expoſe it and ridicule it, but rather they would have fallen in with St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Sermons, as being agreeable to many of their Sentiments. That Goſpel therefore which both the <hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>Greeks</hi> were ſo much offended with, that they reproach'd it as Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Folly, muſt be ſomething ſtrange to their Ears, and exceedingly different from their own Opinions.</p>
               <p n="5">V. I may add alſo at laſt, that if St. <hi>Paul</hi> had meant no more by the <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt</hi> than this, that God was willing to be reconciled to Mankind, if they would repent of their Sins, and be ſorry for them, and liv'd as well as they could for Time to come, there had been very little Reaſon for him to ſpeak of his Courage in preaching it ſo often as he does, and that with ſuch an <hi>Emphaſis,</hi> Rom. i. 16. <hi>I am not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt, for it is the Power of God unto Salvation;</hi> and he repeats it again. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> i. 12. and encourages young <hi>Timothy</hi> to preach the ſame Goſpel, <hi>with Boldneſs, and not be aſhamed of Chriſt,</hi> nor his Miniſters. He counts it a great thing, that he could <hi>glory in the Croſs of Chriſt, Gal.</hi> vi. 14. and in his Doctrine of <hi>Chriſt crucified,</hi> and is reſolved to ſpread the Savour of it round the World. <hi>I am not aſhamed of this Goſpel, I am ready to preach it</hi> among the <hi>Jews</hi> or the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> or in the City of <hi>Rome</hi> itſelf. <hi>Rom.</hi> i. 15. Now if he had preached nothing but the <hi>Socinian</hi> Goſpel, there was nothing in it that would have expoſed him to much Shame and Reproach for the Hopes of Forgiveneſs, upon meer Repentance; and the Enforcement of the Duties of Natural Religion, with a little Illuſtration and Advance upon them, was much like the Goſpel or Doctrine of the wiſeſt of the <hi>Heathen</hi> Philoſophers, that he had almoſt been eſteemed one of thoſe wiſe Men, and rather treated with Honour amongſt them at <hi>Athens,</hi> and in other <hi>Gentile</hi> Cities,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:006440_0034_1028EF5FD3C700E8"/>
and not been reproached as a <hi>ſetter forth of ſtrange Gods,</hi> and called a <hi>Babbler</hi> for his Preaching of ſuch ſort of Doctrines.</p>
               <p>But when the Apoſtle preaches the <hi>Son of God in the Likeneſs of Man,</hi> that came down from Heaven, not to ſet up a Throne in the World, and rule perſonally over the Nations, but to be expoſed to Shame and Pain, to be nail'd to a Croſs, and have a Crown of Thorns put upon him, and indure all theſe Sufferings for the Sins of Mankind: When he tells the Heathen World of a Man that was hang'd upon a Tree at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and aſſures them, that his Death is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and Spring of Eternal Life, to all that believe on him; when he preaches, that the <hi>Lord of Glory was crucified,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ii. 8. that ſo the worſt ſort of Sinners might be ſaved, and <hi>that he who knew no Sin was made a Sacrifice for our Sins, that we might</hi> ſtand Righteous in the Sight of God thro' his Righteouſneſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 21. This was ſomething that ſounded ſo ſtrange in the Ears of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> and the blinded <hi>Jews</hi> too, that they multiplied Reproaches upon the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and the Preacher. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> thought it a conſiderable Point gained, when he could aſſume ſuch a Degree of Courage as to be able to ſay, I dare preach amongſt the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and at <hi>Rome</hi> ſuch a Goſpel as this is; <hi>for I am not aſham'd of the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi> This is an Argument which, in my Opinion, carries much Evidence with it, that the <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt</hi> is ſuch a Doctrine as I have before deſcribed.</p>
               <p>But here is a conſiderable <hi>Objection</hi> ariſes againſt this Deſcription of the Goſpel. How can the <hi>Atonement</hi> for Sin by the Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> be ſo conſiderable a Part of the Goſpel, when <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, the great Prophet of his Church ſpoke ſo ſeldom and ſo very little of it during the whole Courſe of his Miniſtry. Surely one

               <p n="1">I. The great Deſign of our Saviour in his publick Appearance and Miniſtry on Earth, was to prove him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to wear the true Characters of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the <hi>Jews</hi> from many falſe Expoſitions and Gloſſes which the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> of that Day had given to ſeveral Parts of Scripture, to lead the World to a Conviction of their Sins, and thereby prepare them to receive the Doctrine of Salvation with more Zeal and Deſire; whereas the Salvation itſelf, and the Manner whereby it was accompliſhed, was but briefly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in ſome few Texts, and the reſt was left to be explained by his Apoſtles.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The Doctrine of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Atonement for Sin is, indeed, intimated in ſeveral Places of his own Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations (<hi>viz.</hi>) Matt. xx. 28. <hi>The Son of Man came not to be miniſter'd unto, but to miniſter, and give his Life a Ranſom for many.</hi> John x. 15. <hi>I lay down my Life for the Sheep.</hi> John vi. 51. <hi>The Bread which I will give is my Fleſh, which I will give for the Life of the World.</hi> And when he inſtituted the Holy Supper, Luke xxii. 19. <hi>He took Bread and brake it, ſaying, This is my Body which is
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:006440_0036_1028EF66AA1C0398"/>
given for you.</hi> And as in St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Goſpel, <hi>This Cup is my Blood of the New Teſtament which is ſhed for many for the Remiſſion of Sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. This Doctrine of Atonement for Sin by his Death, as a Sacrifice, and the Acceptance of it with God the Father, could not be ſo well preached in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, before thoſe very Facts were fulfilled, upon which this Doctrine is founded; for his Death was the Foundation of this Atonement; his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion to Heaven, were the Proofs of its being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with God: Now it might have appear'd pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous to our Saviour, who was divinely wiſe, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>each theſe Doctrines freely in Publick to the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, before theſe Events appear'd in the World.</p>
               <p>And even to his own Diſciples he was not too free in the Communication of them, becauſe, as <hi>John</hi> xvi. 12. He told them, <hi>he had many Things to teach them, but they could not bear them yet</hi>: It might have been the Means of raiſing ſome Prejudices in the Minds of his own Diſciples; whereas he reſerved ſome of theſe Things to be taught in thoſe forty Days, while he continued with them after his Reſurrection, and <hi>ſpake with them of the Things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.</hi> Acts i. 3.</p>
               <p>And thence we may infer, that if we would learn the plaineſt and fulleſt Account of the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> 'tis not enough for us to conſult merely his publick Sermons, or the Hiſtories of his Life, which are called the Four Goſpels, but we muſt read carefully the Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Apoſtles, after he went to Heaven; in which they taught theſe Doctrines more compleatly, which they had learnt from the Converſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> after his Reſurrection, as well as by the pouring out of his own Spirit upon them in great Abundance, as he had promiſed.</p>
               <p>But there is another <hi>Objection,</hi> which is borrowed from the <hi>Socinian</hi> Writings, which it may be proper to
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:006440_0037_1028EF6833FD1CD0"/>
give ſome Reply to (<hi>viz.) That it does not agree to the moral Perfections of God to puniſh Sin in a Surety; nor does it become the great God who is a Being of infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs and Equity, to appoint ſuch a Way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for Men,</hi> as would neceſſitate an innocent Creature to be expoſed to ſo many ſharp Sufferings as <hi>Chriſt</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent, while the guilty Sinner ſuffers nothing of all theſe Terrors, but is deliver'd from the ſevereſt of them by the Death of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Anſwer</hi> to this, I deſire it may be conſider'd, that this Doctrine of the Expiation and Atonement for Sin by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is ſo plainly and expreſly revealed and declared in the New Teſtament, by the Apoſtles <hi>Paul, Peter,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> as has been already ſhewn, and is ſo frequently repeated in many Forms of Speech in the Sacred Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that it ſeems a very bold Imagination to ſuppoſe, that that could not be <hi>agreeable to the moral Perfections of God,</hi> or that <hi>it could not become God</hi> to appoint that, which in ſo many repeated Scriptures, is expreſly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted to be done by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and by the Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Father. Can it be ever imagined, that the Great God did not know what would become every one of his Perfections better than we little Inſects, juſt crept out of the Earth, and returning thither again, could teach him? Can it be ever thought, that the Eternal Mind did not know what was decent for a juſt and a wiſe God to do, better than we can conceive or ſuggeſt?</p>
               <p>I <hi>anſwer,</hi> in the <hi>ſecond</hi> Place, that ſome of the very Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions wherein this Doctrine is repreſented in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are ſuch as ſeem to be deſigned on purpoſe to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate this very Objection, particularly 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 21. <hi>God has made him to be Sin for us who knew no Sin, that we might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> i.e. he made him to be a Sacrifice for Sin for us, that we might be deliver'd from the Guilt of Sin, and accepted as righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:006440_0038_1028EF6B107E1B60"/>
in the Sight of God. Again, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> iii. 18. <hi>Chriſt alſo hath once ſuffer'd for Sins, the Juſt for the Unjuſt,</hi> that he might bring us to God. Again, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> ii. 21, 22. <hi>Chriſt ſuffer'd for us, who did no Sin, neither was Guile found in his Mouth, who his own ſelf bare our Sins in his own Body on the Tree.</hi> Again, 1 <hi>John</hi> ii. 1, 2. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous: He is the Propitiation for our Sins.</hi> Thus you ſee all theſe Texts declare expreſly the Innocence of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> who ſuffer'd, and the Iniquities of thoſe for whom he ſuffer'd: It is evident enough that a righteous Perſon died for the Guilty, and the Guilty were ſaved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> III. Let it be yet further conſider'd, that the Man <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> who had a natural <hi>Will</hi> which was diſtinct from the ſupreme <hi>Will</hi> of the Godhead, gave up himſelf to thoſe Sufferings, and conſented to it fully, <hi>Heb.</hi> x. 5, — 10. <hi>In Burnt-offerings and Sacrifices of</hi> Beaſts <hi>thou hadſt no Pleaſure; but a Body haſt thou prepared me: Then I ſaid, Lo, I come to do thy Will, O God.</hi> He had a Right <hi>given him by the Father to lay down his Life,</hi> and a <hi>Right to take it up again. John</hi> x. 18. And he had an <hi>additional Exaltation</hi> promiſed him on this Account, <hi>Heb.</hi> xii. 2. and actually beſtow'd on him for this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: <hi>Phil.</hi> ii. 9. <hi>Wherefore God hath highly exalted him,</hi> beſides ſeveral other Events in the Divine Scheme of God's Government, for the Glory of God, and the Happineſs of Men. All which are ſufficient to make the Sufferings of <hi>Chriſt</hi> very conſiſtent with the Equity and Juſtice of God, tho' the innocent Creature ſuffer'd and the Guilty was ſet free. So that I ſee no manner of inconſiſtency between this Tranſaction, and any of God's Moral Perfections; and therefore I can ſee nothing in it which was unbecoming for God to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point, or for <hi>Chriſt</hi> to ſubmit to.</p>
               <p>To confirm this, let it be remembred, that it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> ii. 10. <hi>It became him for whom are all Things, and by whom are all Things, in bringing many Sons

               <p>Nor is it at all ſtrange, that thoſe who borrow from the <hi>Socinian</hi>

And again: <hi>Any, even the greatest Force is to be uſed with Words, rather than take them in the obvious Senſe.</hi> So his Second Epiſtle to <hi>Balcerimicius.</hi>

                  <hi>SECT. I.</hi> Is the Goſpel a Conditional Promiſe?</head>
               <p>THE general Nature and <hi>Subſtance</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is agreed on all Hands to be a <hi>Diſcovery of Divine Grace to ſinful Man thro' a Mediator</hi>: But ſeveral Parties of Chriſtians have raiſed endleſs Debates about the particular <hi>Form</hi> of it (<hi>viz.</hi>) Whether it be a mere ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Promiſe, or a Conditional Covenant: Whether it contain in it Commands and Threatnings or no: Or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be a New Law.</p>
               <p>It is my Opinion concerning many of the Debates about our Religion, that they may be ſufficiently deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined for the Peace and Practice of Chriſtians, by finding out the various Uſe of Words in common Language, and eſpecially the Senſe of them in the holy Scriptures, and ſubmitting our Judgments and Conſciences to this Senſe of them, with a little reconciling Explication. And

this noiſy Controverſy may, perhaps, come nearer to a Deciſion, if we will but honeſtly conſult the Ways of ſpeaking, that the Scripture uſeth in ſolving theſe three following <hi>Queſtions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But before I propoſe them, I would beg one Favour of my Readers, and that is, as they run over theſe Pages, they would ſo far deny themſelves of a common Cuſtom, as not to examine and judge of this little <hi>Eſſay</hi> by any Syſtems or Orthodoxy in their Cloſet, or in their Head, but by the only Syſtem, out of which I have drawn it, the Holy Bible; for in the whole Compoſure of this Diſcourſe, I have not conſulted one Author beſides; and I would chuſe to be read juſt in the ſame way in which I write, and to be judged by the ſame Rule. I proceed now to name the three following <hi>Queſtions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>QUESTION I.</label> 
                  <hi>Whether the Goſpel be an Abſolute or a Conditional Promiſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The <hi>Goſpel</hi> in its moſt general Senſe may be deſcribed as a Declaration of the free Mercy of God, for the Salvation of fallen Man by a Mediator.</p>
               <p>As Man by his Fall hath loſt the Image of God and his Favour, Salvation includes the Recovery of both theſe: It implies therefore Repentance, Regeneration, Holineſs and Perſeverance, as well as Juſtification, Adoption and Glorification; we muſt be ſaved from our Sins, as well as from the Wrath of God, if we are made truly happy. <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Mediator <hi>ſaves his People from their Sins.</hi> Matt. i. 21. as well as <hi>delivers from the Wrath to come.</hi> 1 Theſ. i. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe ſeveral Bleſſings included in Salvation, tho' they are all beſtowed freely by Grace, yet have a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion one with another, and Dependance on each other; therefore ſome of them are repreſented as fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:006440_0042_1028EF74B6652BC0"/>
others as following; ſome as Means, the others as the End. Faith, Repentance, Regeneration, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Juſtification, Adoption, Sanctification, Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the Aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance, may all be eſteemed as Means, with regard to the great and final Bleſſing of Glorification, which is the End; and indeed, every foregoing Bleſſing may be reckoned in ſome Senſe, as a Means with regard to that which follows.</p>
               <p>Again, ſome of the Bleſſings included in Salvation, are to be wrought in us, as Repentance, Sanctification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Others to be only beſtowed upon us, as Pardon of Sin, Adoption, Eternal Glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thoſe that are to be wrought in us, are ſometimes ſet forth in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as Duties to be performed by us, to ſtir us up in a rational way to ſeek them; and thoſe that are only to be beſtow'd upon us, are ſet forth as Bleſſings to be confer'd in conſequence upon ſuch Duties performed; for God will ſave us ſtill as intellectual Creatures, under a moral Government, and will have our rational Powers uſed in obtaining and poſſeſſing this Salvation; and therefore it is ſometimes ſet forth as a propoſed Agreement between two intelligent Beings, God and Man, and is called the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> a <hi>better Covenant,</hi> and the <hi>Word of Reconciliation.</hi> Heb. viii. 8. <hi>and</hi> viii. 6. 2 Cor. v. 19.</p>
               <p>Upon theſe Conſiderations the Goſpel or Covenant of Grace is ſometimes repreſented as a mere Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Grace, or an abſolute Promiſe in Scripture, and ſometimes as a conditional one. It is repreſented <hi>Abſolutely</hi> in theſe Texts, <hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 8. <hi>The Scripture foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God would juſtify the Heathen through Faith, preached before the Goſpel unto</hi> Abraham, <hi>ſaying, In thee ſhall all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be bleſſed.</hi> Heb. x. 16, 17. <hi>This is the Covenant that I will make with them after thoſe Days, ſaith the Lord; I will put my Laws into their Hearts, and in their Minds will I write
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:006440_0043_1028EF764B1639F0"/>
them: And their Sins and Iniquities will I remember no more.</hi> Though the Word <hi>Covenant</hi> does uſually ſignify an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement on both ſides, yet 'tis ſufficiently evident, that in the Language of Scripture it does not always imply Reſtipulation or mutual Agreement; for 'tis ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to the Day and the Night, and their ſtated Courſes, to the Beaſts of the Field, as Inhabitants of this Earth, <hi>Jer.</hi> xxxiii. 20, 25. <hi>Gen.</hi> ix. 9, 10.</p>
               <p>All the Bleſſings of the Goſpel, both the Means and the End, are repreſented in a way of free or abſolute Donation by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> frequently. So <hi>Eph.</hi> ii. 8, 9. <hi>By Grace ye are ſaved through Faith, and that not of your ſelves, it is the Gift of God, not of Works, — for we are his Workmanſhip,</hi> &amp;c. In other places of Scripture the Goſpel is repreſented in a <hi>Conditional</hi> way, as Mark xvi. 15, 16. <hi>Preach the Goſpel to every Creature, he that believeth ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Matt. xi. 28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you Reſt,</hi> John vii. 37. <hi>If any Man thirſt, let him come unto me and drink,</hi> 1 John i. 9. <hi>If we confeſs our Sins, he is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and juſt to forgive us our Sins,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe are properly called <hi>conditional</hi> Propoſitions in a logical or rational View of the Relations of things.</p>
               <p>And it may be obſerved, that thoſe very parts of our Salvation which in one Scripture are commanded as <hi>Duties,</hi> in another are promiſed as <hi>Bleſſings.</hi> So Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Repentance are <hi>Duties</hi> required. <hi>Mark</hi> i. 15. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and believe the Goſpel:</hi> They are <hi>Bleſſings</hi> beſtowed, <hi>Phil.</hi> i. 29. <hi>To you it is given to believe,</hi> Acts v. 3. <hi>God hath exalted him — to give Repentance</hi>: And it is eaſy to bring inſtances of the like Nature concerning ſeveral other parts of our Salvation.</p>
               <p>Now according to the Diſtinctions I have laid down, the foregoing Bleſſings which are as Means, may be eſteemed <hi>Conditions</hi> with regard to others which are as the End of them: So Juſtification and Adoption, as
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:006440_0044_1028EF7C2E89C5C8"/>
well as Faith and Repentance, and Perſeverance, all which are as Means, may be called <hi>Conditions</hi> in regard of Glorification which is the laſt End. In that golden Chain of Salvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 30. Calling, Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Glorification are three great Links. <hi>Whom he called, them he alſo juſtified: And whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified.</hi> But all agree if we are not called, we ſhall not be juſtified: If we are not juſtified, we ſhall not be glorified. Thus every Bleſſing of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that in the neceſſary order of Nature follows another, may be ſaid to be ſuſpended on that other, as a <hi>Condition</hi> without which it ſhall not be beſtowed.</p>
               <p>Again, thoſe Bleſſings that are repreſented as our Duties, and are to be wrought in us, may be ſaid to be <hi>Conditions</hi> with regard to conſequent Bleſſings that are only conferred upon us: (for the word <hi>Condition,</hi> in its moſt common Senſe, does by no means imply that it muſt be performed by our own Power, not does it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude any thing of a valuable Conſideration or Merit in it.) And therefore in this Senſe, Faith may be called a <hi>Condition of Juſtification,</hi> becauſe Faith and Juſtification are connected together in Scripture, and Faith is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as a foregoing Bleſſing, and as a Duty, Juſtification as a conſequent Bleſſing, and a Privilege which is ſuſpended upon it. Gal. ii. 16. <hi>Knowing that a Man is not juſtified by the Works of the Law, but by the Faith of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>even we have believed in</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>that we might be juſtified.</hi> So the Uſe of Water is a Condition of being made clean, ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Fire is a Condition of being warmed, ſo the putting on a Garment is a Condition of being clothed, receiving a ſealed Pardon is the Condition of a Priſoner's Releaſe, committing the Body to a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician is the Condition of a ſick or dying Man's being healed: And in this Senſe Faith is called a Condition of our Intereſt in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by the Aſſembly of Divines in
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:006440_0045_1028EF7DB9A04608"/>
their larger Catechiſm under the <hi>Queſtion, How is the Grace of God manifeſted in the ſecond Covenant?</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Grace of God is manifeſted in the ſecond Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, in that he freely provideth and offereth to Sinners a Mediator, and Life and Salvation by him, and requiring <hi>Faith</hi> as the <hi>Condition</hi> to intereſt them in him, promiſeth and giveth his Holy Spirit to all his Elect, to work in them that Faith with all other ſaving Graces, and to enable them unto all holy Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, as the Evidence of the Truth of their Faith and Thankfulneſs to God, and as the way which he hath appointed to Salvation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Nor can I ſee any ſufficient Reaſon why the Grace of <hi>Faith,</hi> as a <hi>Bleſſing</hi> conferr'd, may be called the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a following Bleſſing, and yet Faith, conſider'd as a Duty, may not be called a Condition of the ſame Bleſſing, ſince both the Habit and the Act of Faith are the Effects of Divine Grace working in us and by us; and where Faith is propoſed as a Duty, it is repreſented more evidently in a conditional way than where 'tis mentioned as a mere Bleſſing.</p>
               <p>And upon the ſame account, Holineſs and Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance may be called the Conditions of our compleat Salvation in Heaven, becauſe Hollineſs and Perſeverance are foregoing Bleſſings and Duties, and compleat Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in Heaven is the final Privilege, <hi>Heb.</hi> xii. 14. <hi>Without Holineſs no Man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> Matt. xxiv. 13. <hi>He that endures to the End ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Nor doth Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> nor other moderate Writers in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, refuſe the uſe of the word <hi>Condition</hi> in ſuch a Senſe.</p>
               <p>What I have ſaid concerning the various Bleſſings of the Goſpel or new Covenant, may be apply'd alſo to the Seals or Symbols of it, <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper.</hi> Theſe are Seals on God's part, which he hath appointed for the Confirmation of our Faith, by the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:006440_0046_1028EF8096F1B7E0"/>
Help of our Senſes, and that he might give us, as it were, a real Pledge of the Performance of his Promiſes. Thus Abraham <hi>received Circumciſion a Seal of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Faith,</hi> Rom. iv. 11. Thus we receive Baptiſm as a Seal of our Regeneration by the Holy Spirit: Thus the Lord's Supper as a Seal of our Pardon and Life by the Crucifixion and Death of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But as great Privileges as they are, thus granted to us, we muſt remember they are alſo Duties to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by us, and are Seals on our part of our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement to be the Lord's. Nor have we any Reaſon to expect the Comforts that ariſe from theſe ſealed Bleſſings of the Goſpel if we wilfully deſpiſe and neglect the uſe of the Seals: And in this Senſe they may be called Conditions of the Privileges, and Comforts that are annexed to them.</p>
               <p>I deſire it here to be noted, that I ſpeak not this to encourage and promote the common uſe of the word <hi>Condition</hi> in theſe Caſes; for it is not uſed in Scripture, except once in a Parable; and that not in the Original, but only in our Tranſlation. The Text is <hi>Luke</hi> xiv. 33. where 'tis not at all to the purpoſe of the preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy: The Conditions there mentioned are not the Conditions of our Salvation, but quite another thing: The Deſign of the Parable is to ſhew that thoſe who have not Courage to fight with their ſpiritual Enemies, the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, muſt e'en make <hi>Conditions of Peace with them,</hi> that is, ſit ſtill and neglect <hi>Chriſt</hi> and Religion.</p>
               <p>Beſides the Word <hi>Condition,</hi> (though it be an innocent and an uſeful and expreſſive Word in the matter of Duty and Privilege) yet it hath been ill explained by ſome Preachers, and worſe underſtood by ſome Hearers, and thereby it hath given great Offence: I ſay this therefore only to ſhew that there is not ſo much Hereſy and Poiſon in thoſe four Syllables as ſome learned Men
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:006440_0047_1028EF83A1874850"/>
pretend, and ſome unlearned believe and fear. If any Man will fix ſuch a rigid Senſe on the word <hi>Condition</hi> as is inconſiſtent with the Grace of the Goſpel; and then ſay, the Goſpel has no Conditions in it, I will not contend with him; for he ſpeaks conſiſtently with himſelf, and with Scripture too; becauſe Scripture does not uſe the Word: But if <hi>Condition</hi> be taken in a very plain and common Senſe for <hi>any one thing upon which another is ſuſpended,</hi> I do not know any Scripture that forbids the uſe of it, but ſuch Texts as theſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> x. 32. <hi>Give no Offence to — the Church of God.</hi> Rom. xv. 2. <hi>Pleaſe your Neighbour for his Good to Edification.</hi>

                  <hi>Whether Commands and Threatnings belong to the Goſpel?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The word Goſpel or <hi>euaggelion</hi> though it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies <hi>Glad Tidings</hi> in its original Derivation, yet it is uſed in Scripture ſometimes in a larger Senſe, as well as ſometimes in a more proper and limited one.</p>
               <p>When 'tis uſed in its proper and limited Senſe it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes a mere Declaration of the good Will of God for the Recovery of fallen Man: So the Texts before cited <hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 8. <hi>Heb.</hi> x. 16, 17. And ſo 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 19. where the Goſpel is called <hi>the Word of Reconciliation,</hi> the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it is, that <hi>God was in</hi> Chriſt, <hi>reconciling the World to himſelf, not imputing their Treſpaſſes to them.</hi> So the firſt Goſpel that ever was preached to <hi>Adam,</hi> after the Fall, was a free Diſcovery of Mercy, Gen. iii. 15. <hi>The Seed of the Woman ſhall bruiſe the Serpent's Head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Word <hi>Goſpel</hi> is uſed in its larger Senſe, it includes Predictions, Commands, Promiſes, Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, Hiſtories, Examples, and almoſt whatever is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to enforce thoſe Duties upon the Conſciences
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:006440_0048_1028EF874B04E088"/>
of Men, which are as Means appointed, in order to partake of the Privileges.</p>
               <p>So the <hi>Goſpel</hi> contains in it Narratives of Matters of Fact, or Hiſtories, Mark i. 1. <hi>The beginning of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which ſeems to refer to all the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hiſtory of his Life and Death; and the four Hiſtories of the Evangeliſts are called <hi>Goſpels,</hi> which Title (if not Divine originally, yet) has been the Language of the Church, through ſo many Ages of Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>The Word <hi>Goſpel</hi> contains, alſo, ſome <hi>Doctrines,</hi> Col. i. 5. <hi>The Hope which is laid up for you in Heaven, whereof ye heard before in the Word of Truth of the Goſpel.</hi> The Goſpel reveals Truths before unknown to Men. So <hi>Life and Immortality are brought to Light by the Goſpel,</hi> 2 Tim. i. 10. <hi>i. e.</hi> Doctrines of the heavenly State.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Commands,</hi> 2 Cor. ix. 13. <hi>By the Experiment of this Miniſtration they glorify God for your profeſſed Subjection to the Goſpel of</hi> Chriſt. This Subjection to the Goſpel, implies, that Liberality is commanded in it. <hi>Acts</hi> xvi. 21. <hi>Believe in the Lord</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> This is the Command given to the convinced Jailor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Promiſes and Threatnings,</hi> Mark xvi. 16. <hi>Preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to every Creature; he that believeth and is baptiz'd ſhall be ſaved, he that believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Predictions,</hi> particularly of the final Judgment. Rom. ii. 16. <hi>God ſhall judge the Secrets of Men by</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>according to my Goſpel.</hi> That is, according as I have preached.</p>
               <p>It is plain, that ſometimes the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is ſaid to be the Object of Belief, as Mark i. 15. <hi>Believe the Goſpel</hi>; and there it ſignifies a Declaration of Grace to Sinners. Sometimes it is ſaid to be the Object of Obedience. Rom. x. 16. <hi>All have not obeyed the Goſpel:</hi> there it muſt include Duties and Commands.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="unknown:006440_0049_1028EF88D65043D8"/>It is alſo evident, that in many Places of the New Teſtament, the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is uſed to ſignify the who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Miniſtry of the Apoſtles, and all the Subjects of their preaching, as Rom. i. 9. <hi>Whom I ſerve in the Goſpel.</hi> 1 Cor. ix. 14. <hi>They that preach the Goſpel ſhould live of the Goſpel, (viz.</hi>) be maintained, not merely for preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Promiſe, but for the whole of their Miniſtration; and therefore the Apoſtle ſometimes calls it <hi>my Goſpel,</hi> and <hi>our Goſpel,</hi> to ſignify his whole Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>Nor do I think there is any great Difference, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we include Commands, Threatnings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Word <hi>Goſpel,</hi> taken in a large Senſe, or call them Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices and Attendants of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> taking the Word in a Senſe more proper and limited: For the Language of Scripture ſeems to favour the one as well as the other.</p>
               <p>But this is the Miſchief that ariſeth between Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians that differ in their Sentiments or Expreſſion of Things, they imagine that while one is true, the other muſt needs be falſe; and then they brand each other with Error and Hereſy; whereas if they would but at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Scripture, that would ſhew them to be both in the Right, by its different Explication of their own Forms of ſpeaking. The <hi>Goſpel</hi> hath, or hath not <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands</hi> and <hi>Conditions</hi> in it, according to the various Senſes in which 'tis uſed.</p>
               <p>And in this way of Reconciliation I cannot but hope for ſome Succeſs, becauſe it falls in with the univerſal fond Eſteem that each Man hath of his own Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; it proves that two warm Diſputers may both have Truth on their Side: Now if ten Perſons differ in their Sentiments, it is much eaſier to perſuade all of them that they may be all in the Right, than it is to convince one that he is in the wrong.</p>

               <p n="1">I. That there be ſome Command given out, wherein ſome Duty is required, or Sin forbidden by the juſt Authority of a Superior.</p>
               <p n="2">II. That there be a Sanction, or Penalty annexed to the Neglect of that Duty required, or the Commiſſion of that Sin forbidden: This Sanction is not always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, but it is always imply'd; for the Authority that is ſufficient to impoſe a Command on any Perſon, muſt alſo be ſufficient to puniſh the Breach of this Command, and the Offender is liable to bear it; otherwiſe the Command would be a mere Advice, and not a Law.</p>
               <p n="3">III. That the Performance of this Duty or Duties required, and Abſtinence from theſe Sins forbidden, is our proper Righteouſneſs, or Matter upon which we are juſtified in the Court of this Law.</p>
               <p>Theſe three Things are imply'd in every ſtrict and proper <hi>Law</hi>: And I might prove it by Inſtances of the chief Laws that Scripture ſpeaks of (<hi>viz.</hi>) The Law of Innocency, the Law of Nature, and the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law.</p>
               <p>Thus it was in the <hi>Law of Innocency</hi> or Covenant of Works with <hi>Adam</hi>; the Duties required, were all that the Light of Nature and Reaſon enjoin'd to <hi>Adam</hi> in ſuch Circumſtances, to which there was one poſitive Prohibition added, <hi>Thou ſhalt not eat of the Tree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> &amp;c. and the Sanction and Penalty is expreſs'd; <hi>In the Day thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely die,</hi> Gen. ii. 17. and <hi>Adam</hi>'s Obſervance of this Law would have been his Righteouſneſs in the Sight of God, and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him before God, according to the general Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:006440_0051_1028EF8EDF81E718"/>
of this, and all Laws. <hi>The Man that doth them ſhall live in them,</hi> Gal. iii. 12. And 'tis generally agreed, that the Tree of Life was a Symbol or Seal of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Life to <hi>Adam,</hi> if he obeyed the Law.</p>
               <p>Thus it was alſo in the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> or moral Law, which is very little different from the Law of Innocency, and this Law is plainly deſcribed by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> ii. 12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>The Work of the Law is written in the Hearts of the Heathens, i. e.</hi> The general Commands and Penalties may be found by the Light of Nature, and <hi>the Doers of this Law ſhall be juſtified.</hi> Not that St. <hi>Paul</hi> means, that any Perſon ſhall actually be juſtified by his Doing, but that this is the way of Juſtification, according to the Law of Nature.</p>
               <p>Thus it was, alſo, in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law or <hi>Sinai</hi> Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which was not the Goſpel, but an additional Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, relating only to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, to be govern'd by God as their peculiar King. And it was really diſtinct from the Covenant of Grace or Goſpel of Salvation, whereby <hi>Adam, Noah, Abraham,</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> themſelves were to be ſaved. Some Perſons, indeed, call it a legal Diſpenſation of the Covenant of Grace (with whom I will not contend) but it is more agreeable to the Language of Scripture, to call it a diſtinct Covenant, or a Covenant or Law of Works, as a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Appendix to the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>It is true, indeed, the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law had much of Grace in it as well as much of Terror, and in many Parts of it, it repreſented, typify'd, witneſs'd and held forth the Goſpel or Covenant of Grace, whereby all Believers in all Ages are to be ſaved, as well as the original Law of Nature, or the general Covenant of Works, whereby all Men are curſed and condemn'd; and the Apoſtle makes uſe of it in all theſe Views in his Epiſtles to the <hi>Romans, Galatians</hi> and <hi>Hebrews</hi>: But the <hi>Jewiſh</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="unknown:006440_0052_1028EF9194C7A038"/>
Law in its own proper Nature and Deſign, was a ſpecial or particular <hi>Covenant of Works</hi> with temporal Promiſes and temporal Threatnings.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Duties</hi> enjoin'd were chiefly contained in the four laſt Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and commonly called the <hi>Moral,</hi> the <hi>Ceremonial,</hi> and the <hi>Judicial</hi> or <hi>Political</hi> Law: The <hi>Sanction</hi> is written in many Parts of thoſe Books; ſome of the Threatnings or Penalties were to be inflicted on particular Offenders by the Magiſtrate, ſuch as, beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Rods, ſtoning to Death, Fines and Amerce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Money or Goods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some were to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on the whole Nation by God himſelf, if they tranſgreſſed this Law, ſuch as Plagues, Famine, Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Deut.</hi> xxviii. and the <hi>juſtifying Righteouſneſs</hi> according to this Law, was their Obedience to the Precepts and Ordinances of it. Deut. vi. 25. <hi>And it ſhall be our Righteouſneſs if we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to do all theſe Commandments before the Lord our God, as he hath commanded us.</hi> So Deut. xxiv. 13. ſo Rom. x. 5. Moſes <hi>deſcribeth the Righteouſneſs which is of the Law, That the Man which doth thoſe Things ſhall live by them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now let us conſider how far the <hi>Goſpel</hi> partakes of the Nature of a <hi>Law,</hi> and may be ſo called.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The <hi>Goſpel</hi> taken in a large Senſe, hath ſo much of the Nature of a <hi>Law</hi> in it, that there are Commands given, Duties enjoin'd, Sins forbidden; and it hath a Sanction alſo, for there are terrible Penalties annexed to the Contempt or Rejection of it, even a <hi>much ſorer Puniſhment</hi> than was threaten'd for the Breach of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Heb. x. 28, 29. And becauſe it partakes ſo much of the Nature of a Law, and hath ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance to it, it is in a few Places of Scripture called a <hi>Law,</hi> without Diſpute. Iſa. ii. 3. <hi>The Law ſhall go forth from</hi> Zion. Rom. iii. 27. <hi>The Law of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="38" facs="unknown:006440_0053_1028EF9320CF2798"/>II. The <hi>Goſpel</hi> is not a <hi>Law</hi> in the full Senſe of the Word, for it wants the third requiſite of a <hi>Law.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Duties are required in the Goſpel, the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of thoſe Duties by us is not deſcribed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as the Matter of our Righteouſneſs before God. There are many Bleſſings promiſed, and Bleſſedneſſes pronounced in the Goſpel upon the Diſcharge of various Duties of Holineſs, which are preſcribed in the New Teſtament; but in the Court of God and his Word, a Sinner is not juſtified by any, or all theſe Duties. Faith itſelf, which is the firſt and great Requirement of the Goſpel, is not our juſtifying Righteouſneſs, but is the Way and Means to obtain, or be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of a juſtifying Righteouſneſs. The Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by which we are juſtified under the Goſpel doth not uſe to be repreſented as a Righteouſneſs wrought in us, or by us, or as a Righteouſneſs of Works, or a Righteouſneſs of Man; but it is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned as a Righteouſneſs from without us, a <hi>given Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> Rom. v. 27. <hi>a Righteouſneſs imputed without Works,</hi> Rom. iv. 6. And it is commonly called by St. <hi>Paul, the Righteouſneſs of God;</hi> it is a Rectitude in the Court of God including or inferring an Abſolution from Guilt, and a Right to Heaven appointed, prepared and beſtowed by God himſelf upon all them that believe; and it is received by our Faith or truſting in <hi>Chriſt. The Righteouſneſs of God is by the Faith of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>unto all and upon all them that believe,</hi> Rom. iii. 22. And it is called <hi>the Gift of Righteouſneſs,</hi> in Rom. v. 17. as a very diſtinct Thing from the <hi>Gift</hi> of <hi>Faith.</hi> Eph. ii. 8.</p>
               <p>And here we may do well to take Notice that tho' there are a great many Differences between the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> preached, and the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law, ſuch as the Multitude of arbitrary Commands in the natural and civil Life, the Burden of many Ceremonies, the Temporal Promiſes and Threatnings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet the grand
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:006440_0054_1028EF94ACD8D9A8"/>
Point ot Difference, which he frequently inſiſted on, is the different way of Juſtification (<hi>viz.</hi>) That the one is by Works, the other not. (Always remembring that before God as the great Lord of Conſcience, and with Regard to eternal Life, the <hi>Jews</hi> were to be juſtify'd and ſav'd by the ſame Goſpel, and by Faith, even as <hi>Abraham</hi> of old, and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> now. But with regard to God, conſidered as their Political Governor or King by the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant, they were to be juſtified by Works.) The Bleſſed Apoſtle therefore treating accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately of theſe Matters ever diſtinguiſhes the <hi>Goſpel</hi> from the <hi>Law,</hi> whether it be the Law of Nature, the Law of Innocency, the <hi>Jewiſh Law,</hi> and indeed, from every thing that hath the full Nature and Form of a Law, by this particular Mark (<hi>viz.</hi>) that our Obedience to the Law would be our juſtifying Righteouſneſs if we perform'd it; but Obedience to the Goſpel is not our Juſtifying Righteouſneſs. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 2d and 3d <hi>Chap.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">See this more enlarged and explain'd in the Harmony of all Religions <hi>Chap.</hi> v. <hi>and</hi> vi.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law (conſider'd as a ſpecial Covenant, or as it includes or repreſents the general Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) ſays, <hi>Peace to every Man that worketh Good, to the</hi> Jew, <hi>and the</hi> Gentile: <hi>and the Doers of the Law ſhall be juſtified;</hi> Rom. ii. 10, 13. But <hi>the Righteouſneſs of God,</hi> i. e. that Righteouſneſs whereby we are juſtified according to the Goſpel, is a <hi>Righteouſneſs without the Law,</hi> a different thing from a Law-Righteouſneſs, <hi>and is</hi> now <hi>manifeſted</hi> by the Goſpel, and comes <hi>upon every Believer,</hi> Rom. iii. 21, 22, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So Rom. x. 5, 6. <hi>The Righteouſneſs of the Law ſaith, The Man that doth thoſe things ſhall live by them: But the Righteouſneſs of Faith ſaith,</hi> v. 9. <hi>If thou ſhalt confeſs with thy Mouth the Lord</hi> Jeſus, <hi>and believe with thy Heart — thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="unknown:006440_0055_1028EF9881FCF8E0"/>
So Gal. iii. 11, 12, <hi>&amp;c. The Law is not of Faith,</hi> for this very Reaſon, becauſe the Law ſays, <hi>Do this and live,</hi> or <hi>Obey and be juſtified.</hi> But the Goſpel ſaith, <hi>The Juſt ſhall live by Faith. Believe and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> And in the following Verſes, the Goſpel is repreſented under the Term and Title of a <hi>Promiſe</hi> to diſtinguiſh it more evidently from a <hi>Law</hi>: for <hi>if there had been a Law which could have given Life, verily Righteouſneſs ſhould have been by the Law.</hi> Gal. iii. 21. <hi>But Scripture hath concluded all under Sin, that the Promiſe by the Faith of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>might be given to them that believe.</hi> This is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Language of Scripture.</p>
               <p>And therefore inſtead of repreſenting the ſeveral Duties injoin'd in the Goſpel, as the Matter of our Righteouſneſs before God, the New Teſtament ſends us expreſly to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> for Righteouſneſs. So St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, Rom. iii. 2, 5. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>ſet forth as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation — that God might juſtify them that believe,</hi> and yet <hi>be a juſt</hi> and righteous God, Rom. v. 17, 18, 19. <hi>They that receive — the Gift of Righteouſneſs ſhall reign in Life by one</hi> Jeſus Chriſt. — <hi>So by the Righteouſneſs of one, the free Gift came upon all Men to Juſtification of Life. — By the Obedience of one,</hi> i. e. Chriſt, <hi>ſhall many be made righteous.</hi> God will have a <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> in his Goſpel whereby <hi>Grace ſhall reign to eternal Life,</hi> Rom. v. <hi>ult.</hi> though 'tis not a Righteouſneſs of our own Works, as the Objection in the very next Verſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> vi. 1. evidently proves, and ſo Rom. x. 3. <hi>Chriſt is the End of the Law for Righteouſneſs to all that believe,</hi> 1 Cor. i. 30. Chriſt <hi>is made of God Righteouſneſs to us</hi>; and 2 Cor. v. 20, &amp;c. where the Goſpel is particularly deſcribed as the <hi>Word of Reconciliation,</hi> we are told that Chriſt <hi>was made Sin for us, that we might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> and this Righteouſneſs is expreſly called <hi>the Righteouſneſs of our God and Saviour</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, 2 Pet. i. 1. becauſe it is the immediate Reſult of his
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:006440_0056_1028EF9C58B1BB48"/>
Obedience and Death. And it is upon this account in the Old Teſtament, he is more than once called <hi>the Lord our Righteouſneſs.</hi> But when I explain in what Senſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> is our Righteouſneſs, I would take more time and room, leſt if I ſhould not keep exactly to the common Forms of Expreſſion, I ſhould want a larger Vindication.</p>
               <p>Now though our Obedience to the firſt and great Command of the Goſpel (<hi>viz.) Believing in Chriſt,</hi> is not our Righteouſneſs, (leſt it exclude <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the Righteouſneſs of God) yet it is the way of our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of this Righteouſneſs; and therefore our Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification or Juſtifying Righteouſneſs is ſo often called <hi>the Righteouſneſs of God by Faith, and the Righteouſneſs of Faith; e ek piſteos dikaioſune. Rom.</hi> ix. 30. <hi>Rom.</hi> x. 6. <hi>dikaioſune dia piſteos,</hi> and <hi>epi te piſtei. Phil.</hi> iii. 9. all which are more properly rendered, <hi>The Righteouſneſs that is by or through Faith,</hi> or, <hi>that comes upon our believing.</hi> In other Places 'tis expreſs'd, that we are <hi>juſtified by Faith</hi>; but ſtill in Oppoſition to the Works of any true and proper Law. And it is in this Senſe that <hi>Faith</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>imputed</hi> or <hi>accounted for Righteouſneſs.</hi> Rom. iv. 5. it is not ſaid, Faith is our Righteouſneſs, or inſtead of a perfect Righteouſneſs, but <hi>logizetai eis dikaioſunen, i. e.</hi> in order to our Juſtification; meaning, that of all the Graces wrought in us, or Actions done by us, Faith is the only thing that God <hi>makes account of or reckons to our Advantage, in order to our Juſtification,</hi> or our obtaining a juſtifying Righteouſneſs; and that not as a Work or Duty performed, as is proved by the Context, but chiefly for this very Reaſon, becauſe it renounceth every thing of Works, and goes out of Self to depend intirely on Grace, which is the Deſign of all that 4th Chapter, by a parallel Inſtance of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s not depending on his own Sufficiency of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but on God's Power to fulfil the Promiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="unknown:006440_0057_1028EF9DE3000D70"/>Nor is this Expoſition of the Words <hi>eis dikaioſunen</hi> forced or ſtrange, for they are uſed exactly in the ſame Senſe in other places, even when 'tis joined with <hi>piſteuo,</hi> Rom. x. 10. <hi>With the Heart Man believeth unto Righteouſneſs,</hi> i. e. in order to his obtaining a juſtifying Righteouſneſs, or in order to Juſtification; ſo <hi>v.</hi> 4. Chriſt <hi>is the End of the Law for Righteouſneſs to every one who believeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Account of things gives a plain Reaſon why the Goſpel juſtifies and accepts thoſe Perſons who perform an honeſt and ſincere, but a very poor, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and imperfect Obedience to the Commands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it, although thoſe Duties are there commanded in Perfection, (<hi>viz.</hi>) becauſe it is not our Obedience to thoſe Commands that is the juſtifying Righteouſneſs of the Goſpel, but another Righteouſneſs that is given us, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Freedom from Guilt, and a Right to Life, when we obey the firſt great Command (<hi>viz.) Believing</hi> or <hi>truſting</hi> in <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas a proper Law requires perfect Obedince for Juſtification: The Language of every proper Law is this; <hi>Curſed</hi> or condemned <hi>is every one that continueth not in all things that are written in the Book of the Law to do them,</hi> Gal. iii. 10. and <hi>Whoſoever ſhall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one Point, he is guilty of all.</hi> James ii. 10. That can be no juſtifying Righteouſneſs accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Law which doth not ariſe to the Perfection of the Command, both for Kind, for Degree, for Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, and for every Circumſtance. But the Goſpel propoſing another juſtifying Righteouſneſs to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived only by our Faith, whether this Faith be ſtrong and perfect or no, yet (if it be true) it receives the Righteouſneſs, and the Believer is juſtified. If a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal lay hold on a Pardon with a trembling paralytick Hand, he is as ſafe from Condemnation, as he that with Courage and Strength reaches out his Arm to ſeize
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:006440_0058_1028EF9F6E546D88"/>
it; becauſe it is not his Hand, but the Pardon ſecures him. If an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> ſtung by a fiery Serpent, could but juſt look with half an Eye to the brazen Serpent, he was healed, as well as another that beheld it with ſtrong and ſteddy Eyes. If the Manſlayer was never ſo lame and feeble, yet if he could but reach the City of Refuge, he was as ſecure from the Avenger, as he that fled to it with the ſwifteſt Feet. So he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits his guilty ſinful Soul to <hi>Chriſt</hi> for Salvation, though with a feeble Faith, and far ſhort of Perfection, yet a Righteouſneſs is given him; the <hi>Righteouſneſs of God is unto and upon all that believe, for there is no difference</hi>; and a weak Believer is as ſecure from Hell as a ſtronger, though he cannot have ſo much preſent Evidence or Comfort: And the Reaſon of his Safety is becauſe his believing is not his juſtifying Righteouſneſs, but is only a means to attain it.</p>
               <p>This is my preſent beſt Sett of Thoughts upon this Subject; and though I have copied them all from the Word of God, ſo far as I have been able to underſtand the Meaning of it, yet ſome ſubtile Diſputer may ariſe and tell me, he could embarraſs my Scheme with ſo many Objections, and preſs it with ſuch powerful Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties as are far above my Skill to ſolve, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain me to renounce it.</p>
               <p>If this Diſputer can ſhew me that any part of it is contrary to Scripture, I renounce it freely; but though he might perplex it with Difficulties which I could not eaſily anſwer, yet I would not merely for that Reaſon be bound immediately to renounce it: For there are many Texts of Scripture itſelf which are ſo embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed and perplexed by the cavelling Wit of the <hi>Deiſts,</hi> or <hi>Socinians,</hi> that it may be exceeding hard to give a fair and ſatisfactory Account of them; yet none of us, who are <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> dare to renounce the Scripture, nor thoſe very Texts that have ſo much Darkneſs about them;
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:006440_0059_1028EFA4D487A168"/>
becauſe we have ſo much ſtronger Proof of the Truth of Scripture. How many Difficulties are there in the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nological and Hiſtorical parts, that ſeem ſcarce reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable by all the Learning and Reaſon of Men; and perhaps that Spirit only can reconcile them who knows what were his own Deſigns in writing, what the Idea that the firſt Writers fixed to each Word, what the Senſe which they intended to convey to the firſt Readers, and what accidental Variations may have crept into the Text by the Ignorance or Negligence, the Bigotry or Sacrilege of the Tranſcribers. I have learnt from my youngeſt Years of Philoſophy, not to renounce any Propoſition, for which I ſee plain and ſufficient Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from Reaſon and Revelation, though many Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties may attend it which I am not at preſent able to ſolve. I know the Weakneſs of human Nature.</p>

               <p>Yet that I may make a clearer way for this Diſcourſe, to the Aſſent of my Readers, I would give a Hint or two how the chief <hi>Objections</hi> that I can think of, may be removed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> I. Some may oppoſe me by Scripture, and ſay, Among all the Texts that call the Goſpel <hi>a Law,</hi> there is one that makes our Bleſſedneſs evidently to depend on our doing the Work commanded therein. <hi>James</hi> i. 25. <hi>Whoſo looketh into the perfect Law of Liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful Hearer, but a Doer of the Work, this Man ſhall be bleſſed in his Deed.</hi> Now this looks like Juſtification by Obedience to the Commands of the Goſpel, which is the proper Nature of a Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I. That the Goſpel which hath Advices, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and Threatnings belonging to it ſhould be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times called a Law in Scripture is no Wonder, for the
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:006440_0060_1028EFA660F98358"/>
Word <hi>Law</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> was in ſo frequent Uſe upon all Occaſions, that not only Doctrines, Rules and Conſtitutions were called <hi>Laws,</hi> but even the natural and ſupernatural Principles of human Actions. So <hi>the Law of Kindneſs,</hi> Prov. xxxi. 26. for good Humour, or a Principle of Love and Civility. So <hi>the Law of Sin,</hi> Rom. vii. 25. for the Principles of corrupt Nature and evil Inclinations. So <hi>the Law of the Spirit of Life,</hi> for a Principle of Holineſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 2. And yet if all the Places where ſome ſuppoſe the Goſpel to be called <hi>a Law,</hi> were well examined, we ſhould find them reduced to a very few in reality: Whence it will appear that this is not the common Language of Scripture. The Text cited in the <hi>Objection</hi> ſeems rather to refer to the moral Law, which is called a <hi>Law of Liberty,</hi> becauſe it is freed from its curſing and condemning Power by the Goſpel, and made eaſy to Believers by their new Nature: Now, ſurely, no Chriſtian will ſay that we are to be juſtified by doing the Works of the moral Law.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> II. In thoſe Places of the New Teſtament where the Goſpel is, or is ſuppoſed to be called a <hi>Law,</hi> there is generally ſome qualifying Word added, as, <hi>the Law of Faith, the Law of Liberty,</hi> &amp;c. that it may ſeem to ſtand in Oppoſition to a <hi>Law of Works,</hi> and appear diſtinct from a ſtrict and proper <hi>Law.</hi>

But every ſuch Bleſſing doth not ſignify the Juſtification of a Sinner in the Sight of God, his Releaſe from the Guilt or Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to Hell, and his firſt Right to Heaven.

Another may draw an Argument from Reaſon, and ſay, Whatſoever Duties of Righteouſneſs are required in any Conſtitution or Covenant, the fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe Duties muſt in the very Nature and Reaſon of Things be eſteemed that <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> upon which that Conſtitution pronounces a Man juſt or right in Court; ſo Faith juſtifies us againſt the Charge of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, ſo Repentance and ſincere Obedience juſtify us againſt the Charge of Impenitency and Hypocriſy, and ſo Perſeverance juſtifies us againſt the Charge of Apoſtacy, becauſe 'tis a Conformity to that Rule of Conſtitution which requires Faith, Repentance, Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It muſt be granted indeed, that in the very Nature of Things our Faith juſtifies us againſt the Charge of Unbelief, ſo far as our Faith goes; and our Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and our Love to God juſtify us againſt the Charge of Impenitence, and hating God ſo far as we do repent and love him; and our Meekneſs and Humility and Sincerity, juſtify us againſt the Charge of Pride and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and Hypocriſy, ſo far as we are meek, humble and ſincere: And in this Senſe the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> might ſay, John iii. 7. <hi>He that doth Righteouſneſs is righteous, as God is righteous,</hi> (where <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> is evidently uſed for <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and not in a forenſick Senſe, to ſignify <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi>) But all our Virtues and Graces of Faith, Love, Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſo very far from Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo much below what the Holineſs of God and his Commands require, that the Spirit of God in his Word, hath not thought fit to honour theſe our Works with the Name of <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> when he is deſcribing the Way how a Sinner is juſtified; nor hath he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied

the Term of <hi>Juſtification</hi> to theſe Performances in thoſe Places of Scripture where with a plain Deſign and Exactneſs of Expreſſion he hath treated of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs that juſtifies a Sinner before God. And the holy Apoſtle ſeems cautious of uſing the Word <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> when he is ſpeaking of his own ſincere Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> iv. 4. <hi>I know nothing by myſelf, yet am I not hereby juſtified</hi>; tho' this Juſtification refers only to the Charge of any Negligence in the Diſcharge of his Apoſtolical Office.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> In thoſe Places of Scripture where the Word <hi>Juſtification</hi> is uſed and attributed to our Duties or Graces, we muſt conſider in what Senſe <hi>Juſtification</hi> is taken.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a <hi>Juſtification before Men,</hi> and a <hi>Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in our own Conſciences</hi>; and in both theſe Reſpects our Repentance, our Love to God, our Good Works, all juſtify us againſt the Charges of wicked Men, and againſt the Charges of <hi>Satan</hi>'s Temptations, or our own doubting Conſciences, <hi>i. e.</hi> our Repentance ſhews we are not impenitent, and our Good Works ſhew that we are not full of wicked Works; and Good Works may be ſaid to juſtify us alſo againſt the Charge of a falſe and hypocritical dead Faith, for they prove that our Faith is lively and true; and this is that Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion St. <hi>James</hi> intends, <hi>Chap.</hi> ii. for <hi>ver.</hi> 18. he ſays, <hi>I will ſhew thee my Faith by my Works;</hi> and 'tis in this Senſe that he ſpeaks of <hi>Juſtification by Works.</hi> So <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified from the Charge of a dead Faith, by his Zeal for God in offering up his Son, <hi>Jam.</hi> ii.
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:006440_0063_1028EFAFA4DE2028"/>
21, 23. <hi>Thus was the Scripture fulfilled,</hi> i. e. thus was the Truth and Honour of the Scripture maintained and cleared, which declares <hi>Abraham</hi> to be juſtified by Faith. Now tho' this Act of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith here mentioned, and <hi>Gen.</hi> xv. 6. exerciſed on the expreſs Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> be not the firſt Act of Faith that ever he put forth, and tho' he might be in a juſtified State long before, yet every repeated Act of true Faith confirms the juſtifying Sentence, and ſhews the Way of his firſt Juſtification: And ſo every good Work he performed may be ſaid in another Senſe to confirm his Juſtification too, as it proves the Truth of his Faith, and evidences him to be juſtified.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a <hi>Juſtification at the Day of Judgment,</hi> which is only declarative, and deſigned to publiſh and declare to all the World the Equitableneſs of God's final Sentence, adjudging ſome to Heaven and ſome to Hell: And there our own Holineſs, imperfect as it is, may juſtify us againſt the Charge of being utterly wicked; what good Words we have ſpoken may juſtify us againſt the Charge of being always guilty of evil or idle Words: They ſerve to diſtinguiſh the Character of Saints and Sinners, and to make it appear there is a Difference in their Practice, as well as in their Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, as the Proceſs of that awful Day is repreſented, <hi>Matth.</hi> xxv. And it is in this Senſe that our Saviour ſaith concerning the Day of Judgment, <hi>Matth.</hi> xii. 37. <hi>By thy Words thou ſhalt be juſtified, and by thy Words thou ſhalt be condemned;</hi> that is, your Words as well as your Actions ſhall have a Share in determining your Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter before Men and Angels in that Day. And that Text alſo in the <hi>Rev.</hi> xxii. 12, 14. refers evidently to the laſt Judgment, where it is ſaid, <hi>Behold I come quickly and my Reward is with me, to give to every Man according as his Work ſhall be; bleſſed are they that do his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that they may have Right to the Tree of Life, and
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:006440_0064_1028EFB2879B1520"/>
may enter in through the Gates into the City.</hi> The Senſe of it is, that thoſe who perſevere to the End, in a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Obedience to the Commands of Chriſt, in all the Duties of Holineſs, ſhall have a publick, adjudged and declared Right to the immediate Poſſeſſion of Heaven; which is a very different Thing from the Juſtification of a Sinner in the Sight of God, by his believing or truſting in Chriſt, which gives him the firſt Right; and which is the preciſe Subject of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Diſcourſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> Chap. ii. iii. iv. and v. and <hi>Gal.</hi> Chap. ii. and iii.</p>
               <p>'Tis on this Matter that our Divines are wont to make a Diſtinction between the <hi>Jus haereditarium,</hi> or the <hi>Right of Heirſhip</hi> which a Son has to his Father's Eſtate as ſoon as he is born, (ſuppoſing his Father to be dead) and the <hi>Jus aptitudinarium,</hi> which is a <hi>Right of Fitneſs,</hi> and a Right to the immediate Poſſeſſion, and this he has not till the Age of Manhood. Nor is this Diſtinction ill-framed, nor unaptly applied to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Caſe; for Scripture gives a plain Foundation for it, <hi>viz.</hi> that we have the Right of <hi>Heirſhip</hi> at our firſt believing, and the Right of <hi>actual Fitneſs,</hi> when we have fulfilled all the Services God hath appointed us in this Life. The Scriptures that naturally lead to this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction are theſe: The Right of <hi>Heirſhip</hi> by Faith is very plain, <hi>Rom.</hi> iv. 11, 13, 16. <hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 26, 29. <hi>For ye are all the Children of God by Faith in</hi> Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>And if ye be</hi> Chriſt<hi>'s, then are ye</hi> Abraham<hi>'s Seed, and Heirs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Promiſe.</hi> (Nor doth the Apoſtle make much Diſtinction between our Right to Heaven by Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, and that by Adoption or Inheritance, for both Juſtification and Adoption come by Faith; and he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingles both, as they moſt fitly anſwer his preſent Deſign; which is evident by comparing the Proceſs of his Diſcourſe from <hi>Rom.</hi> iv. 1 — 16. and <hi>Rom.</hi> v. 17, 18, 21.) And then there is the Right of <hi>Fitneſs</hi> for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Poſſeſſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> x. 36. <hi>For ye have Need of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:006440_0065_1028EFB4163BDD30"/>
that after ye have done the Will of God, ye might receive the Promiſe</hi>; and this is the Right intended, <hi>Rev.</hi> xxii. 14. Now we may ſuppoſe both the <hi>Right of Heirſhip</hi> and of <hi>Fitneſs</hi> to be joined in that Text, <hi>Heb.</hi> vi. 12. <hi>Who through Faith and Patience inherit the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</hi> Through Faith they are made Heirs at firſt, and through Continuance in Faith and Patience they are become actual Inheritors. Nor is that Text in <hi>Rom.</hi> x. 10. much unlike, <hi>With the Heart Man believeth unto Righteouſneſs, and with the Mouth Confeſſion is made unto Salvation.</hi> Here Juſtification is attributed to Faith, and Salvation to the outward Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding all the proper Effects and Evidences of Faith in a holy Life. And tho' <hi>Salvation</hi> in many Places of Scripture is put for <hi>Juſtification,</hi> becauſe Juſtification is Salvation begun, yet when they are more accurately diſtinguiſhed, the one is attributed to Faith, the other to Works, or to Faith and Works together.</p>
               <p>Now, whatever other Sorts of <hi>Juſtification</hi> may be mentioned in Scripture, yet this <hi>Juſtification</hi> of a Sinner through Faith requires ſuch a Righteouſneſs as muſt ſecure us from all the Charges and Penalties of all the Guilt of every Sin both original and actual, from all the Charges of God's moſt holy and broken Law, from all the Charges of the Imperfection of our Faith, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and our beſt Works, and muſt ſet a Sinner right and make him righteous, and give him a Right to Life in the Court of that God who juſtified <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David without Works,</hi> by <hi>imputing Righteouſneſs</hi> to them, and continues under the Goſpel the ſame Way to <hi>juſtify the Ungodly,</hi> Rom. iv. 5, 6. <hi>i. e.</hi> all that we do in a way of Duty or Godlineſs, is not reſpected in this Court, but we are look'd upon as <hi>ungodly,</hi> and without all Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in ourſelves, and as ſuch have a Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or a Right to Life beſtowed on us, or are juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified of mere Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="unknown:006440_0066_1028EFB7838F0E78"/>And tho' here and there, for wiſe Purpoſes, an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion may be dropt occaſionally in Scripture, that may favour another Way of ſpeaking, yet in the Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criptions of the Goſpel, the Way of a Sinner's Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the Sight of God at his Converſion, is never put upon fulfilling of the Goſpel-duties, as the Matter of his Juſtifying Righteouſneſs; and therefore the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is not a proper <hi>Law</hi>: And whatſoever Forms of Speech ſome Perſons may fancy agreeable to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Reaſon of Things, yet this which I have deſcribed is the moſt common Way wherein the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of Scripture repreſent thoſe Things, when they ſeem to aim at an accurate and diſtinct Deſcription of the Law and Goſpel: Now Scripture is our ſureſt Rule of ſpeaking in Matters of pure Revelation.</p>
               <p>To ſum up all in ſhort: The Word <hi>Law</hi> is taken in various Senſes in the Bible: In ſome Places it means inward Principles of Action, as the <hi>Law of Kindneſs,</hi> the <hi>Law of Sin</hi>; ſometimes it ſignifies only Directions and Rules of Life, as <hi>Prov.</hi> xiii. 14. <hi>the Law of the Wiſe,</hi> i. e. Rule of Wiſdom. In other Places it includes all the Orders and Injunctions that relate to one Subject; as <hi>the Law of the Nazarite,</hi> Numb. vi. 13. <hi>the Law of the Burnt-Offering,</hi> Lev. vi. 9. Sometimes 'tis taken in ſo large a Latitude as to take in all Doctrines, Counſels and Advices, Commands, Promiſes, Threatnings, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding Prophecies, Hiſtories and Examples alſo; ſo the <hi>Law</hi> frequently ſignifies all the five Books of <hi>Moſes.</hi> And in theſe Senſes the <hi>Goſpel</hi> in its largeſt Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has ſeveral Laws belonging to it, and itſelf may be called a <hi>Law.</hi> The Scripture indulges a ſparing Uſe of it in ſuch a Senſe. But the Word <hi>Law</hi> in its moſt proper and ſtrict Senſe ſignifies a Conſtitution where Duties are required, which if neglected, ſubject the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender to a Penalty, and if performed, they are his Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying Righteouſneſs; and in this Senſe Scripture doth
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:006440_0067_1028EFBA31BE0DF8"/>
not at all favour the Application of this Name to the <hi>Goſpel</hi>: For it is abundantly evident, that the Words <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Goſpel</hi> taken in their moſt proper and limited Senſes, are conſtantly diſtinguiſhed from each other, and ſet in direct Oppoſition in the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>Thus have I thrown into ſome Order thoſe few, plain, reconciling Thoughts between the contending Parties of Chriſtians, and am already almoſt in Pain to think that I ſhall a little diſpleaſe all Parties, becauſe all theſe Thoughts will hardly ſquare and adjuſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves exactly to any of the popular and ſettled <hi>Schemes of Orthodoxy</hi>; or at leaſt, they will never agree with the Extremes on either hand: Yet if they appear to be drawn merely from the Scripture, and to ſpeak the Language of the Holy Writers, then this Diſcourſe will approve itſelf to thoſe who maintain the moſt ſacred Regard to the Bible; and thoſe Schemes ſhould be a little moulded and bent, to adjuſt them to the Language of Scripture, even when it uſes different Forms of Speech. But I ſhall not enter farther into this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, becauſe my Deſign is to ſoften the angry Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of Men, that they may not rage againſt each other when they uſe different Forms of ſpeaking, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture itſelf does, and make an Apology for both Sides, while they agree in the Things that are moſt ſubſtantial and neceſſary.</p>

                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Let me repreſent the <hi>various Apprehenſions</hi> of Men in thoſe Matters: But here I would be underſtood to deſcribe only the moderate Men among thoſe who are called <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> and thoſe that are named <hi>New-Methodiſts</hi>; as for the High-Flyers, or extreme and rigid Party-Men of either Side, I leave them out in my preſent Account, while I mention the little Differences among the Men of Moderation, among whom I reckon far the greateſt part of the <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> to be at this time, and I hope I am not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in this Opinion.</p>
               <p>Some when they read or pronounce the Words <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Goſpel,</hi> take them generally in their looſeſt and largeſt Senſe, and ſo they unite their Names, and make them conſiſtent together; others are ready to take thoſe Words in their limited and proper Senſe, and then they divide them into very diſtinct Things, and will not allow their Names ſo promiſcuous a Uſe.</p>
               <p>Some Miniſters love to explain the <hi>Goſpel</hi> in a more <hi>legal</hi> way, and deſcribe it as a <hi>conditional Covenant</hi> that requires Agreements and Reſtipulation from Men; they inſiſt much on vowing and reſolving to ſubmit to the Commands of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and with a lively Zeal and powerful Eloquence, they inforce the Duties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, ſincere Obedience, Watchfulneſs and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance; and ſhew how much the Promiſes of Life, Heaven and Glory, Peace and daily Pardon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on theſe Qualifications and Performances, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the terrible Threatnings of Damnation on the Impenitent, the Unbelieving, and the Diſobedient, to
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:006440_0069_1028EFC04D521478"/>
awaken the ſecure Sinner, and ſtir up the ſlothful Chriſtian. Others delight more in repreſenting the <hi>Goſpel</hi> as a <hi>Declaration of Grace and free Promiſe</hi> of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to Sinners; a Promiſe of pardoning Mercy, Sanctifying Grace, and everlaſting Glory to ſinful and periſhing Criminals, and invite Sinners to receive all this Grace, to accept of this Salvation, and to truſt in this Saviour, according to the Offers of the Goſpel: When its Truths are revealed, the firſt Sort chuſe to ſay, that the Moral Law of Nature in the Hand of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> commands us to believe them; when its Duties are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, they rather ſay, the Law of Nature in the Hand of <hi>Chriſt</hi> requires Obedience to them; and that while the Goſpel in its proper Language promiſes Salvation to Believers, the Moral Law, or Law of Nature, binds Condemnation on the Unbeliever, and the Impenitent; but the pure Goſpel is all Grace and Mercy: And they preach the Law of Works in the Perfection of its Demands and Terror of its Penalties, to drive Sinners for Refuge to the Goſpel: And they preſs the Duties of Holineſs on their Hearers from a comfortable Senſe of their Deliverance from Hell, and from Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as Evidences of their Faith, as Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives for Heaven, and as neceſſary, both in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Things, and by divine Appointment in order to our final Happineſs.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that follow the <hi>conditional</hi> Way of preaching the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> deſcribe the chief Act of <hi>Faith,</hi> as a <hi>Conſent of Will</hi> to ſubmit themſelves to him in all his Offices; a Conſent to take him for their <hi>Prophet,</hi> and Reſolution to make all his Inſtructions their Rule and Guide; a Conſent to take him for their <hi>Prieſt,</hi> to make their Peace with God, and obtain their Pardon; a Conſent to own him for their <hi>King,</hi> and promiſe ſincere Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him as their Lord in all his Commands;
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:006440_0070_1028EFC216902750"/>
but ſtill with an humble Dependance on his Spirit and Grace, to enable them to fulfil theſe Reſolutions.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that preach the <hi>Goſpel</hi> in its more free and <hi>abſolute Form</hi> deſcribe <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Chriſt</hi> as the Flight of a poor, guilty, periſhing Sinner to an only Refuge; and they make its chief Act to conſiſt in a truſting or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the Soul, ignorant, guilty, hard-hearted and ſinful as it is, into the Hand of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> with a ſincere Deſire to have it enlightened by him as their Prophet, pardon'd and reconciled to God through him as their Prieſt, and ſubdued to all willing Obedience to him, and by him, as their Lord and King; humbly expecting that he will do all this for them; and this is in their Opinion the beſt way of addreſſing themſelves to poor Sinners, who find themſelves ſo dark, ſo ſinful, ſo feeble and inconſtant in their beſt Obedience and Purpoſes, that they dare not reſolve upon any thing, and can hardly ſay, they heartily vow and promiſe a Submiſſion to <hi>Chriſt</hi> in all Things; but that they can better apply to him in a way of Truſt and Dependance, humbly deſiring and hoping he will work all this in them by his free Grace, while they wait upon him in his appointed Means.</p>
               <p>The one are ever perſuading their Hearers to bind their Souls to God, by ſolemn Vows and Covenants, even in particular Duties, believing this to be the moſt effectual Way to guard againſt every Sin, and beſt ſecure their Obedience and Conſtancy under every Temptation: The other are afraid to urge ſo much vowing and reſolving on the Conſciences of Men, leſt they thereby lead them into a legal Frame, under a Spirit of Bondage, and leſt their Conſciences be more troubleſomely entangled and enſnared after every broken Vow, and their Faith and Hope be too much diſcouraged; that Faith and Hope which ought to be the conſtant Springs of their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:006440_0071_1028EFC6E2175350"/>
They adviſe their People, therefore, rather to commit their Souls afreſh continually to the Care of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> i. to believe he accepts them, and to walk watchfully, without any particular, formal, and explicit Vows. Though it muſt be confeſſed, that with regard to Chriſtians of different Tempers and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, both theſe Methods have had very good Succeſs.</p>
               <p>Some are Sons of Thunder, <hi>Boanerges,</hi> and frighten the Profane out of their Security, by many Terrors that are written againſt thoſe who obey not the Goſpel; and they inforce Obedience on the Conſciences of Believers, chiefly by way of Rewards and Puniſhments: The other are like <hi>Barnabas</hi>'s, Sons of Conſolation, and perſwade Sinners to accept of the offer'd Grace, by all the Allurements of the Compaſſion of God, and by the dying Love of a Redeemer, beſeeching them to be reconciled: And they draw out the Hearts of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to Repentance, and lead them with the Spirit of Power and Love to an eaſy and connatural Obedience by the Conſtraints of the Love of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and by a humble Perſwaſion of their Acceptance in him unto eternal Life.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, the one dwell moſt upon the Duties of the Goſpel in their Sermons, in order to qualify their Hearers for the Privileges; the other inſiſt moſt on the Privileges and Comforts of the Goſpel, in order to invite and allure them to fulfil the Duties, and to give their Hearers Strength and Delight in the Diſcharge of theſe Duties.</p>
               <p>I would not here be underſtood, as though I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed either of thoſe Miniſters never to mingle Mercy and Terror, Precepts, Penalties, and Promiſes; for it muſt be acknowledged, there are ſome Perſons of each Opinion, in whom all the Talents of a Preacher hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily unite, and they honourably ſuſtain both Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

the <hi>Sons of Thunder,</hi> and the <hi>Sons of Conſolation</hi>; and all of them make Conſcience of publiſhing to Men both Divine Grace and their Duty, all of them preach Repentance toward God, and Faith in our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> but thoſe who have choſen one Scheme of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity for their own, more generally bend their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry the one way, and thoſe who have choſen the other preach more uſually in the other way.</p>
               <p>All our <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Confeſſions of Faith, and I would perſwade myſelf that our Miniſters, at leaſt among the <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> agree that, though Duties are required to be performed by us, yet the Grace that is neceſſary to perform them is given freely to us; that though Faith and Repentance, and ſincere Obedience, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably neceſſary, in order to our final Salvation, yet they are not the juſtifying Righteouſneſs upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of which our Sins are pardoned, and eternal Life is beſtowed upon us: That the Obedience and Death, and Interceſſion of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as a proper High-Prieſt and Sacrifice, are the only Foundation of our Acceptance with God, and ground of all our Hopes; and that from him, as a Head of Influence, we muſt receive all Grace, whereby we are conducted ſafe to Glory.</p>
               <p>Both Sides agree that we are to <hi>work out our Salvation with Fear and Trembling,</hi> but that it <hi>is God who worketh in us to will and to do,</hi> Phil. ii. 12, 13. That <hi>we are ſaved by the Faith</hi> of the Son of God, and <hi>not by Works, leſt any ſhould boaſt</hi>; yet that we muſt alſo be <hi>created in</hi> Chriſt Jeſus <hi>unto good Works,</hi> for God hath <hi>appointed that we ſhould walk in them,</hi> Eph. ii. 8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p n="2">II. In the <hi>next</hi> place, that I may make a little further Apology for thoſe that are humble, honeſt and ſincere on both Sides, I would conſider the various <hi>Cauſes</hi> or <hi>Occaſions,</hi> whence different Apprehenſions of Men about theſe things may ariſe: And here we ſhall find poor frail Mankind, almoſt univerſally born and brought

up in Prejudices to ſome Party or other, incompaſſed with thouſand things that tend to influence the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and incline it inſenſibly toward ſome particular Opinion; ſo that a whole Scheme of Doctrines built upon a pure and zealous and laborious Search after Truth, without any manner of Byaſs or Corruption on any Side, is ſcarce to be found in human Nature. There is no Man alive free from theſe Weakneſſes. Happy the Mind that has the feweſt of them.</p>

               <p>It may be theſe Miniſters themſelves, who differ in Opinion, are of very different natural Complexions and Tempers, and this hath a ſecret Influence in ſwaying their Mind, their Studies, their Judgment and Miniſtry one way or the other; though all thoſe who agree in natural Temper, are not always of the ſame Opinion.</p>
               <p>Or it may be, they had an Education under Teachers and Tutors of different Sentiments, or have met with Books of different Principles and Opinions, which have made a ſtrong and laſting Impreſſion upon their Minds, and engag'd them betimes into one Party, before they had Strength of Judgment to determine their Opinions upon juſt Arguments.</p>
               <p>Some Perſons in order to ſettle their Judgments in theſe Points, have ſtudied more and prayed leſs, and ſome have prayed more and ſtudied too little; and ſome on both Sides have ſtudied hard, and pray'd much, and ſought earneſtly the Inſtructions of the bleſſed Spirit, and yet have fallen into different ways of thinking in thoſe parts of Chriſtianity which are not of Neceſſity to Salvation, and have been ſuffer'd to follow different Forms of Speech for wiſe Purpoſes in the Providence of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="unknown:006440_0074_1028EFCDBAA53AB8"/>Some little Accident or Occurrence of Life, or ſome ſudden ſtart of Thought, while the Balance of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was in Suſpence, has perhaps given it a turn to one Side or the other, and perhaps determined it for their whole Lives.</p>
               <p>Some have happened to form their Sett of Doctrines at firſt more by their own reaſoning Powers, and drawn their Schemes of Religion from what they imagine the moſt natural Connection, the Neceſſity or Congruity of things, and they call the Bible only to their Aſſiſtance, and ſeek proper Texts to confirm their own Syſtem: Others draw the whole Scheme of Doctrines from a conſtant and intent Application to the holy Scripture, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ll in Reaſon to their Aſſiſtance, only in order to underſtand and methodize thoſe Doctrines: And though the firſt way of Study in Matters of the <hi>Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Religion, is by no means to be juſtified, yet too many have unhappily practiſed it; and though the latter way is much to be preferred, and moſt likely to come near the Truth, yet it is not followed by all who preach the Goſpel; and no wonder then that Miniſters may differ in their Thoughts.</p>
               <p>Such is the Weakneſs of human Nature, that as ſome of us form and build up our firſt Opinions upon very ſlight and inſufficient grounds, and there are many who perſiſt in them, and ſtrongly maintain them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an honeſt Re-examination, ſo others of us change our Opinions upon Reaſons as ſlight and feeble and inſufficient. Some Perſons having been perplexed with one or two great Difficulties in that Scheme of Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which they have profeſſed, and being unable to grapple with them, have by ſwift or ſlow Degrees, abandoned that whole Scheme, and fell in with another, which perhaps hath equal or greater Difficulties in it; never conſidering that the whole Syſtem of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> with all its Appendices, is ſo vaſt, and our View of
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:006440_0075_1028EFD1FAB2B3F0"/>
things is ſo narrow, and our Knowledge ſo imperfect, that a ſharp Diſputant may puſh ſome parts of all our human Schemes into great Perplexities, even ſuch as human Reaſon can hardly ſolve; and perhaps God alone knows how to reconcile them, in whoſe ſingle View all things lie for ever fair and open, perfectly conſiſtent, and are comprehended at once.</p>
               <p>Or it may be the <hi>Way</hi> and <hi>Method</hi> of <hi>Divine Grace</hi> in <hi>the firſt Converſion</hi> of the one and the other was very different. Some were wrought upon at firſt more by legal Methods, and the Terrors of the Law of God, and they find them ſtill to have the greateſt and moſt powerful Influence on their Conſciences; others from their wild Wandrings were brought home to <hi>Chriſt</hi> by gentle Diſcoveries of Divine Love in the Death of a Saviour: Some, like the Jaylor, <hi>Acts</hi> xvi. 26, — 30. have had their Conſciences ſhaken as with an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, they <hi>came in trembling and crying out, What muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> Others had their Hearts <hi>ſoftly open'd,</hi> as was the Heart of <hi>Lydia,</hi> 14th <hi>ver.</hi> of the ſame Chapter, and they received the Word of Grace and the Goſpel; and they find the Work of God carried on upon their own Souls, ſtill by the moſt evangelical Methods. Now a Man's own early Experiences in the things of Religion, will naturally have a great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on his Opinions; and God in his infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom hath ordered it ſhould be ſo, that Perſons of every Sort and Temper, and Humour, Young and Old, Sinners and Saints, under every kind of Temptation, might meet with ſome Miniſters of the Goſpel, and ſome Sermons and Writings to ſuit their Taſte, to hit their Caſe, and be the moſt effectual Means of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Third thing</hi> I propoſed here was to ſhew briefly, that as <hi>each of theſe ways of preaching have their ſeveral Advantages,</hi> ſo each of them have their <hi>ſpecial Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="unknown:006440_0076_1028EFD473BFCD80"/>
too, if they are perpetually and only inſiſted on, unleſs well managed by the extraordinary Prudence of the Preacher.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The one</hi> aims moſt at the <hi>Glory of Divine Equity,</hi> in Rewards and Puniſhments, and contends much for the <hi>Sincerity of God</hi> in all his Tranſactions with Men: The other ſeems to look moſt at honouring <hi>the Sovereignty, the Riches and Freedom of Divine Grace,</hi> and God's infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Condeſcention and Compaſſion to ſinful Creatures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>One</hi> ſeems to lead <hi>Chriſtians</hi> more to a ſtrict Scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſity in every Action, in order to make up the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Evidences of a Goſpel-Perfection, which they call <hi>Sincerity,</hi> and thereby to raiſe their Hopes of eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hell and obtaining Heaven; it drives the Soul to Duties, and maintains a trembling Watchfulneſs; but is in Danger of governing it by a Spirit of Bondage, and of keeping our Faith and Comfort very low. The other leads to equal Holineſs, or perhaps to higher Degrees of it by the delightful Conſtraints of a filial Love, by the ſweet Influences of Divine Conſolation; but there may be ſome Danger of incouraging Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and Preſumption, and that not only in Sinners, but even ſometimes in Believers themſelves, if not wiſely managed and guarded.</p>
               <p>Upon this Subject I might here give my Pen into the Hand of ſome ſprightly Advocate of each Party, and have forty more Pages written for me ſpeedily, without any Thought or Labour of mine; this would ſwell my <hi>Eſſay</hi> up finely, and enlarge it to a Volume, with many a Name of <hi>Arminian</hi> and <hi>Antinomian</hi> dealt about freely on the oppoſite Opinions: For the ſuppoſed Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages and Diſadvantages on both Sides, are frequently mentioned as Arguments of each Party againſt the other; but I ſhall not think neceſſary to inſiſt longer on them here for that very Reaſon: And though theſe ſort of moral Arguments drawn from the Deſign and
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:006440_0077_1028EFD60439AA40"/>
Tendency of things, may be juſtly uſed on both Sides, and on both Sides have ſome Degree of Truth and Force in them, yet both may not have equal Force: Nor do I think it inconſiſtent with my Deſign in this reconciling Diſcourſe, to declare my own Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents: <q>For a Man may be very happy in making Peace between two quarrelling Neighbours, though he is well perſwaded that one hath the better Side of the Cauſe, and in a friendly manner expreſſeth it too.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I will not be aſhamed then to declare, that in my Opinion, one Method of preaching the Goſpel hath greater Advantages in it, and fewer Inconveniences than the other; ſuppoſing ſtill that we guard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Extremes: that one ſeems more connatural to the Genius of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> as it is diſtinct from a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works,</hi> and ſeems to ſuit better with the moſt glorious Deſigns of Divine Grace. My own Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the Things of Religion, my Obſervations of ſome others, and my diligent Search of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (I hope not without Divine Aid) hath led my Thoughts rather to favour and practice the more Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Method of preaching moſt frequently: But another Perſon who follows a different way may tell me, he came by his Turn of Thoughts the ſame way as I did by mine, and my Charity demands that I believe it. Yet while both Sides maintain thoſe great Truths, wherein I mentioned the general Agreement of our <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Confeſſions of Faith, I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that either of them can lead Sinners aſtray from Salvation.</p>
               <p>And that is the <hi>Fourth Propoſal</hi> I made, (<hi>viz.</hi>) to ſhew the real <hi>Safety</hi> of each of theſe Methods in miniſtring the Goſpel both to Saints and Sinners, and that is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, becauſe they agree in the moſt neceſſary and eſſential Parts of it. Both of them preach Grace and
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:006440_0078_1028EFD9377ABA70"/>
Duty, Juſtification by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and Sanctification by the Holy Spirit, and teach Men all that is of Neceſſity to be believed and practiſed in order to Salvation.</p>
               <p>If two Men ſitting under a different Miniſtry are brought ſincerely to repent of all Sin, and to love God with all their Heart, can I imagine that one ſhall be damned, becauſe he tells me he repents in Obedience to the Commands of the Goſpel? Or the other, becauſe he doth it in Obedience to the moral Law in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſuppoſing the pure Goſpel to have no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in it? If two Sinners are perſuaded to accept of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> for their Lord and Saviour, can I ever believe, that God will condemn one of them, becauſe he firſt reſolved to obey <hi>Chriſt</hi> as his Lord, and thereby took Encouragement to truſt in him as a Saviour? or that God will puniſh the other for ever, becauſe he firſt truſted in <hi>Chriſt</hi> as a Saviour, and thereby found his Will ſweetly inclined to ſubmit to him as his Lord? Where all Duties required in the Goſpel are ſincerely performed, can I ever be perſuaded Men ſhall be ever ſent to Hell, merely becauſe they do not agree about the <hi>logical Relations</hi> that theſe Duties have to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or to their Salvation, while both agree to lay the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and his Righteouſneſs, or his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Death, as the only Foundation of all their Hopes?</p>
               <p>If either of theſe Ways of preaching the Goſpel were ſo contrary to Scripture, and ſuch abominable and pernicious Errors in the Sight of God as angry and quarreling Men of both Sides repreſent them, I cannot perſuade myſelf that God would ſo far have favoured both, in theſe Inſtances following. (<hi>viz.</hi>)</p>
               <p n="1">I. If either of theſe Ways of preaching were ſo cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal and dangerous as ſome have ſuppoſed, I cannot think the Spirit of God would have uſed thoſe Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in Scripture, which ſometimes ſeem to repreſent
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:006440_0079_1028EFDC782CE7B8"/>
the Covenant of Grace in one Form, and ſometimes in another; nor that he would have ſuffered the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of his holy Word to have given Occaſion to ſuch different Sentiments on this Subject among his Favourites, his holy Worſhippers, and thoſe who have ſought his Directions and his Grace with much Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and Perſeverance.</p>
               <p n="2">II. If either of theſe Ways of preaching were ſo dangerous as ſome have imagined, I cannot believe that the bleſſed God would ever have attended both theſe Ways of preaching with his Bleſſing, ſo far as to convert great Numbers of Sinners by them, and edify his Saints; but it is ſufficiently evident that Miniſters of very different Apprehenſions in theſe Points have been owned and bleſſed of God to the Converſion, Comfort and Salvation of many Souls.</p>
               <p n="3">III. If either of theſe Repreſentations of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel were ſo very dangerous, I cannot imagine, that Perſons of good Underſtanding, of deep Learning, of large Knowledge in Religion, of long Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and of great Holineſs, ſhould maintain their Opinions in theſe Things ſo very different to their Lives End, if their Salvation were in ſuch extreme Hazard thereby, however in the Infancy of their <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> they might have received and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced theſe different Apprehenſions. Surely if theſe Points had been of ſo dreadful and dangerous Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance on either Side, God would have granted a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Union in Sentiment to ſo great a Number of his Children, who laboured in ſincere Inquiry after Truth, conſtant and fervent Prayer for the Teaching of the bleſſed Spirit, and were truly zealous for his Honour. Divine Goodneſs ſurely would not have ſuffered ſuch Multitudes of holy Souls on either Side to continue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in Miſtakes of ſo terrible Conſequence as ſome Diſputers have repreſented them.</p>

               <p>May I be permitted at the End of this Diſcourſe to drop a Word or two of general <hi>Advice,</hi> or rather of humble Requeſt to all, but eſpecially to my younger Brethren in the Miniſtry.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>Requeſt. Pay a conſtant and ſacred Reverence to the Language of Scripture,</hi> and let it appear in theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Inſtances.</p>
               <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> Let the Forms of Speech that are uſed in thoſe Scriptures where the Doctrines of the Goſpel are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly laid down and proved, be the Speech in which you commonly teach thoſe Doctrines; and let the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage wherein warm and pathetical Exhortations are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in Scripture, be the Language which you generally imitate in your affectionate Addreſſes to the Conſciences of Saints and Sinners; the one as well as the other are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for our Example. Whereas if we ſhould preach and explain the deepeſt Truths in all the affectionate Forms and Flouriſhes of Speech and Metaphor, 'tis the Way to lead the Judgments of Hearers aſtray; but while we ſubmit ourſelves to the Words which the Holy Spirit uſeth as our Pattern, both in teaching, and alſo in exhorting, we may humbly expect his inward Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to enlighten our own Underſtandings, and make our Labours in the Goſpel powerful to the Salvation of them that hear us.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> Let thoſe Words which are not uſed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture never be zealouſly maintained and inſiſted on as neceſſary to Salvation, and eſpecially where they give great Offence: Nor let thoſe Terms and Ways of Expreſſion which Scripture uſeth but very ſeldom, and upon particular Occaſions, be the perpetual or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Language of your Miniſtry, in Oppoſition to
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:006440_0081_1028EFE0787A7F00"/>
thoſe Expreſſions and Ways of Repreſentation which Scripture moſt frequently delights to uſe; and let no authentic Syſtems of Divinity, to which you are moſt inclined, nor the Names of great Men ever prevail with you to break this Rule.</p>
               <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> Dare not indulge yourſelf in a Diſguſt to any Scripture Language, or an Averſion to thoſe Scriptures which ſeem to run in a Stile and Expreſſion different from the Language which you generally chuſe; for even thoſe Expreſſions were deſigned for uſeful Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes by the Holy Spirit, and doubtleſs have attained ſome happy End in the Providence of God, in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Caſes and Perſons: If you ſhould once encourage ſuch a vicious Humour, it might proceed ſo far at laſt, as to render a great Part of the Bible the Object of your Diſguſt. Be ſure therefore always to maintain upon your Spirit ſuch a reverential Tenderneſs for the Holy Scripture, that you may never dare to rail againſt any Expreſſions that Scripture uſeth, nor oppoſe them with Violence, without a modeſt Diſtinction in what Senſe they are proper, and in what Senſe they are to be avoided. And this leads me to the <hi>Second Requeſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Requeſt.</hi> When you hear any Miniſters, in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel, uſe the Words <hi>Free and abſolute, Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, Unconditional, Promiſes, Laws, Threatnings, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Exerciſe ſo much Charity as to believe they uſe them in ſuch a Senſe as the Scripture approves of, and as ſecures the Salvation of Men,</hi> according to their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cereſt Apprehenſions.</p>
               <p>If the Preacher ſpeak of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> as a free and abſolute <hi>Promiſe,</hi> always ſuppoſe he intends alſo, that all the Duties of Repentance and Holineſs are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, in order to Salvation, though he does not like to call them <hi>Conditions.</hi> If another ſhould inſiſt much on <hi>Conditions</hi> in the Goſpel, ſuppoſe he means none of them to be performed merely by your own Strength, nor to
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:006440_0082_1028EFE2FB756F80"/>
include any Thing of <hi>Merit</hi> in them. If he ſpeak of the <hi>Laws of Chriſt,</hi> underſtand him concerning all thoſe Rules and Directions, and Commands, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath given to his Followers, but not in the ſtrict and perfect Notion of a <hi>Law.</hi> Even if he calls the Goſpel a <hi>Law,</hi> believe that he intends it only in the largeſt Senſe, and doth not mean that we are juſtified in the Sight of God, by our Performance of the Duties of this Law as the proper Matter of our Righteouſneſs before God: Or if he ſhould happen to mention any ſuch Thing as Juſtification by our good Works of Holineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> take due Heed to the Connection, and let Charity perſuade you that he is ſpeaking concerning <hi>Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before Men,</hi> or <hi>Juſtification in our own Conſciences,</hi> or <hi>in the Day of Judgment,</hi> and not of a Sinner's Juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Righteouſneſs in the Sight of God, when he is firſt converted and accepted of him through Faith in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Suffer not your Diſguſt and Anger immediately to be kindled at the Sound of any of theſe Words, as though they were at once undermining and perverting the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Nor ever give your ſelf leave to reproach Miniſters, as no Preachers of the Goſpel, merely becauſe they chuſe other Modes of Expreſſion than thoſe which you moſt eſteem, and frequently uſe, for ſuch a Conduct will warp and bind down the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences and Spirits of Men to a narrow and an uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Partiality. This will render every Sermon of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive to them that is not conceived juſt in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Language, and will utterly prevent their Profit by the various Gifts <hi>Chriſt</hi> has beſtowed on his Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. There are ſome common <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in our Age, who are moſt unhappy Inſtances of this <hi>unchriſtian</hi> Temper; and 'tis to theſe Perſons chiefly, that I give his <hi>ſecond Advice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>Requeſt. Avoid all the high Flights and Extremes
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:006440_0083_1028EFE5995EA100"/>
of zealous Party Men,</hi> and which Way of Preaching ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you approve and purſue, be ſure to guard againſt all Extremes, both of Notion and Language. Let the Hopes of exalting Free Grace never perſuade you to neglect to enforce the Duties of the Goſpel, and to preſs them with Zeal on the Conſciences of all Men: Nor let the Fear of encouraging Licentiouſneſs ever tempt you to turn the Goſpel of Grace into a Covenant of Works: For God in his Goſpel of Free Grace hath ſufficiently provided for the Honour of his Holineſs, and the Sanctification of his own Children.</p>
               <p>You will tell me here perhaps, that Scripture itſelf uſeth Expreſſions as high upon particular Occaſions, and as much leaning to Extremes as any Men of Party among us. But remember then, that the Scripture uſes ſuch ſtrong and high Expreſſions not on one Side only, but on both Sides, and infinite Wiſdom hath done this more forcibly to argue and impreſs ſome preſent Truth or Duty: But while it is evident the holy Writers have uſed high Expreſſions, ſtrong Figures of Speech, and vehement Turns on both Sides, this ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently inſtructs us that we ſhould be moderate in our Cenſures of either Side, and that the calm doctrinal Truth, ſtript of all Rhetoric and Figures, lies nearer to the middle, or at leaſt that ſome of theſe appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Extremes, are more reconcilable than angry Men will generally allow. If the Apoſtle charges the <hi>Corinthians, So run that ye may obtain,</hi> 1 Cor. ix. 24. and tells the <hi>Romans, it is not of him that willeth or of him that runneth, but of God who ſheweth Mercy,</hi> Rom. ix. 16. we may plainly infer that our Running and his Mercy, our Diligence and Divine Grace, are both neceſſary to our Salvation.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>Requeſt. Let the particular Tempers, Temptations and Dangers of Perſons with whom you converſe, or with whom you preach, together with the growing Errors of the

Times, have always ſome Weight with you, to bend your Miniſtry a little more the one way or the other:</hi> And never affect to preach theſe Matters in a diſputative and controverſial Way, but rather in a plain and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Form, except the Temptations of the Age and Nation, or of particular Churches or Chriſtians ſeem to demand it. And indeed this ſeems to be one great Reaſon, why Scripture itſelf in different Parts of it ſometimes manages the Argument in a way of Diſpute, and at other times gives a different practical Turn to the ſame Truth, and uſes ſo different Language in the Repreſentation of the ſame Doctrines. For the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Books of Scripture were written according to the various Neceſſities of the Church of God, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate Temptations of contrary Kinds, and to prevent the Danger of Errors ariſing, by running to Extremes on either Side.</p>
               <p>In the laſt Age, in the Times of the Civil Wars, <hi>Antinomianiſm</hi> and Errors of that Nature, were very common in the Nation: This turned the Labours and Study of many pious Men to vindicate and preach up the Duties of the Goſpel, and Works of Holineſs, as the proper Buſineſs of the Day. In this preſent Age, the <hi>Popiſh</hi> and <hi>Pelagian</hi> Doctrines of Juſtification by Works, and Salvation by the Power of our own Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, are publickly maintained and preach'd abundantly through the Land: The <hi>Socinian</hi> and the <hi>Arminian</hi> Errors are revived and ſpread exceedingly, whereby <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is robb'd of his God-head, or his Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or both, and the bleſſed Spirit deny'd in the Glory of his Offices: For <hi>Deiſm</hi> and <hi>Natural Religion,</hi> in Oppoſition to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> daily prevail.</p>
               <p>Now, perhaps, ſome may think it the Duty and Buſineſs of the Day to temporize, and by preaching the <hi>Goſpel</hi> a little more conformably to <hi>Natural Religion,</hi> in a mere rational or legal Form, to bring it down as
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:006440_0085_1028EFEB4C434C28"/>
near as may be to their Scheme, that we may gain them to hear and approve it, or at leaſt, that we may not offend them. But I am rather of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that we ſhould in ſuch a Day ſtand up for the Defence of the Goſpel in the full Glory of its moſt important Doctrines, and in the full Freedom of its Grace; that we ſhould preach it in its divineſt and moſt Evangelical Form, that the Croſs of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by the promiſed Power of the Spirit, may vanquiſh the vain Reaſonings of Men, and that this deſpiſed Doctrine triumphing in the Converſion of Souls, may confound the Wiſe and the Mighty, and ſilence the Diſputers of this World. This was the bold and glorious Method St. <hi>Paul</hi> took at <hi>Corinth,</hi> where Learning and Reaſon and Philoſophy flouriſhed in Pride; but they yielded ſeveral Trophies of Victory to the preaching of the Croſs. <hi>Paul</hi> could uſe the <hi>Wiſdom of Words</hi> whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he had occaſion for it, and had the <hi>Excellency of Speech</hi> at command when he pleaſed: this appears in ſeveral Parts of his Writings; yet in his Sermons at <hi>Corinth,</hi> he diſclaimed it all, and <hi>determined to know nothing among them but Chriſt, and him crucified.</hi> 1 Cor. ii. 2.</p>
               <p>Happy that Man who hath attained the holy Skill of joining Promiſes and Commands, Duties and Privileges, Authority, Terror and Grace; and who mingles them all wiſely in his Miniſtry; who hath learnt of St. <hi>Paul</hi> the Divine Art of addreſſing himſelf to the Reaſon, the Conſciences, and the Paſſions of Men in ſuch variety of Expreſſions, of Power, Terror and Love, as may moſt effectually anſwer the Ends of his Office. Happy is he that knows how to diſplay the Goſpel in all Forms under which Scripture repreſents it, to preach to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and to teach the <hi>Gentiles</hi>; to talk to the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and the Wicked in proper Language, to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Rebel, to the trembling Sinner, and to the mourning Saint. Happy is he that <hi>becomes all to all that
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:006440_0086_1028EFEE0FC458B0"/>
he may gain the more</hi> Souls, 1 Cor. ix. 19, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as <hi>without the Law, yet under a Law to Chriſt</hi>; ſometimes as with the Law, yet free from the Bondage of it; that never <hi>ſtrives about Words to no Profit,</hi> but <hi>knows how to divide the Word of Truth aright,</hi> and to <hi>give every one their Portion:</hi> This is the <hi>Workman that needs not to be aſhamed,</hi> and hath moſt reaſon to hope for Succeſs. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 14, 15.</p>
               <p>To conclude, <hi>Let us all apply ourſelves with unbiaſs'd Minds, with new Diligence and fervent Prayers, to ſearch the Word of God, and draw all our Notions of the Goſpel thence:</hi> Let us enquire into the ſpiritual State, the Dangers and Neceſſities of the People to whom we miniſter, and this will be of great Uſe to guide us to proper Subjects and Methods of Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Let our Converſation be ſuch, as becomes the Goſpel in every Form of it, whether abſolute or conditional. Let our cloſe walking with God be exemplary and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive, that Men may ſee our Religion as well as hear it, and all may confeſs, that while we preach the Goſpel, we are zealous Obſervers of the Law. Let us maintain upon our own Hearts a ſweet and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Senſe of the Riches of Free Grace in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> together with a tender Senſe of the Evil of Sin, and a lively Delight in Holineſs, that the daily Experience of our own Souls, and our inward Chriſtianity which is taught us, and wrought in us by the Spirit of God, may inſtruct us how to preach to others.</p>
               <p>Let that Goſpel which is <hi>written in the fleſhly Tables of our Hearts, i. e.</hi> in our very Souls, <hi>by the Finger of God,</hi> be manifeſted in every Part of our Miniſtrations for the Good of Men. Thus we ſhall obtain the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of <hi>Jeſus</hi> our Judge, in preaching his Goſpel of Faith and Love, and thus ſhall we have the Pleaſure of this Teſtimony in our own Conſciences, that in the general Courſe of our Miniſtry we have ſought to ſave
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:006440_0087_1028EFF0DBF82030"/>
the Souls of others in the ſame way as we ourſelves have ſought to be ſaved: And that we have propoſed the ſame Truths to them, and recommended the ſame Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which we ourſelves believe and practiſe, in order to our own Salvation. <hi>Amen.</hi>

thy Neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> 20. <hi>The young Man ſaith unto him, all theſe have I kept from my Youth up: what lack I yet?</hi> 21. <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto him, if thou wilt be perfect, go and ſell that thou haſt and give to the Poor, and thou ſhalt have Treaſure in Heaven; and come and follow me.</hi> 22. <hi>But when the young Man heard that Saying, he went away ſorrowful, for he had great Poſſeſſions.</hi> 23. <hi>Then ſaid Jeſus unto his Diſciples, Verily I ſay unto you, that a Rich Man ſhall hardly enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> This is the Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>The Perſon who addreſſed the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> here, was a young Man, and wealthy, as this ſacred Writer informs us; and that he was a Ruler among the <hi>Jews,</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> gives us notice, <hi>Luke</hi> xviii. 18. That he was either a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> or at leaſt one of the ſtricter ſort of the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſeems evident, becauſe he ſought after Eternal Life, whereas the <hi>Sadducees</hi> deny'd a future State, many of the higher as well as the looſer Part of the Nation diſregarded it. He appears leaven'd with the common Phariſaical Doctrine, (<hi>viz.</hi>) that the way to <hi>procure Eternal Life</hi> was by his own good Works, by <hi>doing ſome good Thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis probable he had heard of the Miracles and the Fame of our Bleſſed Lord, and believed him to be a Teacher ſent from God, for he comes in an humble manner as to a divine Prophet, he ſeems to be in good earneſt in the Queſtion which he puts to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſeriouſly concerned about the Welfare of his Soul. He did not come with a Deſign to enſnare <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his Words, as that ſort of Men (<hi>viz.</hi>) the <hi>Phariſees</hi> often did: Nor did he come with uſeleſs perplexing Queſtions, as the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Sadducees</hi> and <hi>Lawyers</hi> ſometimes had done: But, as St. <hi>Mark</hi> relates the Hiſtory, he ſhew'd ſome Tokens of Sincerity. <hi>Mark</hi> x. 17. for <hi>He came running to Jeſus</hi> with Diligence and Speed, longing to have the Opinion of a new Prophet
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:006440_0090_1028EFF8A1C57648"/>
about a Matter of ſuch Importance, as the obtaining of Eternal Life: <hi>He kneeled down to him,</hi> and paid our Saviour much civil Reſpect: He received the Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Chriſt</hi> with Attention, and when he found in his Heart that his Love to his Riches would not let him comply with the Terms propoſed, <hi>he went away ſorrowful.</hi> There was ſomething in his Deſign and in his Deportment, that was lovely and amiable, and we find that our Saviour (as a Man) looked on him with a Love of Complacency, <hi>Mark</hi> x. 21. But he was not ſo zealous a Lover of God to part with Earth for Heaven.</p>
               <p>We may ſuppoſe this young Gentleman, who ſeems to be a Follower or Diſciple of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> might probably have one or more of theſe three Deſigns in his Queſtion. (<hi>viz.</hi>)</p>
               <p n="1">I. Whereas the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> promiſes long Life in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the Bleſſings of this World to thoſe that are obedient to the Statutes and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances which God enjoin'd to <hi>Iſrael</hi>; but it ſcarce ever mentions, plainly and expreſly, any Promiſes of Eternal Life in another World, nor the Methods to attain it; and whereas this Youth was fully convinced from ſeveral of the Writings of the Prophets, that there was a future State and eternal Happineſs in another World to be obtained, he comes now to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as a new and divine Teacher, to ſeek an Anſwer to this <hi>Queſtion about Eternal Life,</hi> which he could not find an expreſs Anſwer to in the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi>; and he would fain know whether he muſt obtain Eternal Life the ſame way that he was to ſeek for a long Life on Earth, and Temporal Bleſſings, namely, by an outward Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Laws already given to the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. We may ſuppoſe him enquiring after ſome ſhorter and more compendious way to Eternal Life, by prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſing ſome one or two extraordinary Inſtances of Duty,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:006440_0091_1028EFFBDC637C90"/>
and thereby to atone for the neglect of the reſt. This was an Error that prevailed among the <hi>Phariſees</hi> in our Saviour's Time, as ſeems to be ſufficiently evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from their Doctrine, as it is repreſented, Matt. xv. 5, 6. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall make a great Preſent</hi> to God and his Temple (as ſome interpret the Word <hi>Corban,</hi> or a Gift) <hi>he ſhall be free</hi> from all relative Duties to <hi>Parents,</hi> &amp;c. So <hi>Matt.</hi> xxiii. 23. if they did but <hi>pay Tythes</hi> duly to the Prieſt they might be ſaved, though they <hi>neglected the weighty Matters of the Law, Juſtice, Judgment and Mercy, and the Love of God.</hi> So the <hi>Phariſee</hi> that went into the Temple to pray, <hi>he faſted twice a-week, and gave Tythes of all that he poſſeſſed,</hi> and he accounted himſelf Righteous. <hi>Luke</hi> xviii. 12.</p>
               <p>And upon this account you find the Queſtion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed elſewhere to our Saviour, Matt. xxii. 36. <hi>Which is the great Commandment of the Law?</hi> Some were for <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> as a moſt ancient Precept, and therefore of the moſt general Obligation: Some for the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> becauſe it was ſo ſtrictly enjoined to the <hi>Jews:</hi> And ſome for <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> as being in their Opinion a ſufficient Expiation and Atonement for any other Defects what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. They thought one or other of theſe to be the critical Points on which Salvation depended.</p>
               <p>And generally we find that the Commands of God, of an external or <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Nature, or the mere Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Traditions of Men, were thus aggrandized by the Teachers of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as though Heaven might be obtain'd in a ſhort way, by practiſing thoſe Formalities, without the long Labours of Watchfulneſs and Abſtinence from Sin, and Obedience to every moral Command of the Law. Yet we muſt ſuppoſe this Perſon to be one of the better ſort of them too, for he had endeavoured to keep the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> (at leaſt in the outward and viſible Duties of it) as well as <hi>Ceremonial,</hi> even from his Youth up, as he tells our Saviour.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="77" facs="unknown:006440_0092_1028EFFFFA7729C0"/>III. Or we may ſuppoſe this young Man hearing the Fame of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as the great Prophet that was to come into the World, might expect ſome new and unheard-of Doctrines, ſome new and unknown way to Heaven, which the Law and the Old Prophets had never ſpoken of; eſpecially ſince he thought he had already fulfilled all that they had required: And therefore he came running to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> kneeling down with earneſt Deſire to be taught this new Revelation, this Method of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Heaven and eternal Life, which the new Prophet was ſent to teach: And perhaps he might imagine <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>: And they knew that <hi>when the</hi> Meſſiah <hi>came he would teach them all things,</hi> which all the former Prophets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf had not fully acquainted them with, <hi>John</hi> iv. 25.</p>
               <p>Or may we not ſuppoſe all theſe three Deſigns toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to be in the Heart of this young Queriſt? As if he ſhould ſay, <q>Good Maſter, <hi>Moſes</hi> in his five Books, hath ſpoken much of Life, <hi>long Life</hi> in the Land of Promiſe, but hath not given us an expreſs Account of <hi>Life Eternal</hi> in the other World, nor preſcribed the ſpecial Methods to attain it; I would therefore fain learn that of thee. And whereas the Statutes and Ceremonies, and Commands and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Duties of the Law, are very numerous and difficult, is there no one good thing that may be as acceptable to God as all the reſt, and give me a Title to eternal Happineſs, in a ſhort and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious manner? Or is there any new way to Heaven which thou diſcovereſt to Men? As thou ſeemeſt to preach up a future State, a Heaven and a Hell in the other World, doſt thou come to give any new Directions how to avoid this Hell, and obtain this Heaven?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Our Lord, before he anſwered his Queſtion, takes Occaſion to ask him, <hi>why he called him Good,</hi> which
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:006440_0093_1028F0018D3103A0"/>
was a Title that eminently belonged to God only: The beſt conjecture that Interpreters can make of this Query, is this, (<hi>viz.) Jeſus</hi> ſearched into his Opinion concerning himſelf, whether he knew or believed that he was the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> or the Son of God, who was <hi>one with the Father,</hi> and thereby had a Right to Divine Titles and Characters, and might juſtly be called <hi>Good</hi> in a Divine Senſe. Perhaps <hi>Jeſus</hi> might have, before this time, manifeſted this his own <hi>Oneneſs with God</hi>; but if he had not, yet there were ſeveral Deſcriptions of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> in the Old Teſtament, wherein the Names and Titles of the true God are given to the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> which could not be given him without ſuch a <hi>Oneneſs with God,</hi> and therefore he might juſtly take Occaſion to catechiſe ſuch a forward young Man who ſeemed to be conceited of his own Righteouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'Tis as if <hi>Jeſus</hi> had ſaid, <q>Thou calleſt me <hi>Good:</hi> There is none originally, eternally and perfectly good but God himſelf; none good as God is; none hath right to the Title in the moſt abſolute and exalted Senſe of it but God: Why then doſt thou uſe this Salutation to me, and give me this Title? Doſt thou think any thing more than Human dwells in me?</q> 
                  <q>Haſt thou known or obſerved any of thoſe Speeches or thoſe Miracles of mine, whereby I have aſſerted and proved that <hi>I am in the Father and the Father in me,</hi> or, that <hi>I am one with the Father,</hi> and ſo partake with him in the Title of <hi>Good?</hi>
                  </q> See <hi>John</hi> x. 30, 37, 38. and xiv, 8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p>Here it may be remarked, that our Saviour did not uſe to publiſh his own Divinity or Oneneſs with God, in plain and expreſs Terms to the People, but generally by ſuch Methods of Enquiry and Inſinuation. See <hi>Mark</hi> ii. 5. — 11. where he had forgiven the Sins of a Man that was ſick of the Palſy before he healed him; and then he proves by the Miracle of healing, that he
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:006440_0094_1028F0049A79C948"/>
had a Right to forgive Sin, while the <hi>Jews</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that none could forgive Sins but God alone. So <hi>John</hi> x. 30, — 36. after he had given a hint of his Deity, by ſaying, <hi>I and my father are one,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> would have ſtoned him for pretending to be God; which he anſwers by ſuch an Enquiry; Since thoſe are called <hi>Gods</hi> in Scripture, <hi>to whom the Word of God came, ſay ye of him whom the Father hath ſanctified and ſent into the World, he blaſphemeth, becauſe I ſaid I am the Son of God?</hi> Such a ſort of oblique Inſinuation, or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry concerning the Divinity of his Perſon, ſeems to be our Lord's Deſign in this Text. If this be not the Purport and Intention of this Queſtion, I muſt confeſs I am ignorant of the Deſign of it. But this ſeems to me the moſt probable Conjecture.</p>
               <p>Then immediately he proceeds to give our young Queriſt an Anſwer to his Queſtion, <hi>If thou wilt enter into Life keep the Commandments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The young Man again ſeems to have his former Deſigns in his Eye, when he asks <hi>which Commandment he ſhould keep?</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, <q>Is it any one particular Commandment or Commandments of <hi>Moſes</hi> that I muſt keep? and if I have kept them, is there any new Commandment thou wilt give me, whereby eternal Life will be inſured to me?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Our Lord replies, Keep the common Commandments of the Law, <hi>Thou knoweſt them,</hi> as Mark x. 17. 'Tis not by obſerving any one Command and neglecting the reſt, but the way to enter into Life is Obedience to all the old Commandments, for <hi>I am not come to break</hi> or diſſolve <hi>the Law of God, but to</hi> confirm or <hi>fulfil it,</hi> Matt. v. 17, 19. And though our Lord <hi>Jeſus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> mentions only thoſe of the ſecond Table, and the Duties towards <hi>Men,</hi> yet we muſt ſuppoſe he means incluſively all the reſt; for he ſaith in Matt. v. 19. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall teach Men to break the leaſt of the Commandments of the Law,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:006440_0095_1028F006782FAAC0"/>
ſhall be the leaſt in the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> i. e. ſhall have no Place there. Our Saviour doth not give a Diſpenſation to neglect Duties toward God, by men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning only the Duties toward our Neighbour; but the Reaſon why he mentions them ſeem chiefly theſe two.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe theſe Duties to their <hi>Neighbours</hi> were thoſe which the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who boaſted of their own Righteouſneſs, more particularly neglected, while they pretended to much Devotion and Worſhip of God in all the Forms of his Appointment; And therefore our Lord inſiſts particularly upon theſe Commands that relate to our Fellow-Creatures, to ſhew him that theſe were as neceſſary a Part of his Duty, as all the more pompous Services of God in his Temple.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe it might be more eaſy for his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to convince him of the Neglect of theſe moral and relative Duties towards his Fellow-Creatures, than of his Neglect of religious Duties towards God: And our Saviour thought when he had named theſe, he had named Commandments enough to ſhew him the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of his Righteouſneſs: Therefore he don't proceed to mention them all.</p>
               <p>And it may be noted, that our Lord reckons up theſe Commands not in their exact Order, nor exactly in the Words of the Old Teſtament, but with a more looſe and negligent way of repeating them, becauſe he ſpoke to a Man that was ſuppoſed to know them already: <hi>Thou knoweſt</hi> all <hi>the Commandments</hi> which I refer to, even the Commands of the moral Law, <hi>Do not kill, do not ſteal,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

into Sight: In what Senſe did our Saviour ſpeak theſe Words to the young Enquirer, <hi>If thou wilt enter into Life keep the Commandments?</hi> Did he deſign to give him a plain and direct Anſwer how he might obtain Eternal Life and Salvation, according to the <hi>Goſpel?</hi> or did he deſign only to convince him of Sin, by preaching the <hi>Law</hi> to him, in order to make him ſee his Guilt and Miſery, that he might ſeek after a better Righteouſneſs than that of the Works of the Law, another way of obtaining Acceptance with God and Eternal Life, than merely by his Doings?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, the laſt of theſe ſeems to be the Deſign of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> He did not intend in theſe Words to give him immediate and direct Inſtruction, how he might actually obtain Salvation, but rather firſt to convince him of Sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and I would offer theſe following Reaſons for it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> The Anſwer of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is exactly ſuited to his Queſtion. Now his Queſtion was about <hi>Eternal Life to be obtain'd by Works,</hi> and not about the <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Sinner</hi> by the <hi>Mercy</hi> of God. He did not ask, as the convinced Jaylor, Acts xvi. 30. <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved,</hi> or to obtain Salvation? But <hi>What g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap> Work muſt I do to obtain Eternal Life by it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is granted that <hi>Eternal Life</hi> is ſometimes put for the final Happineſs of Believers under the Goſpel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is included in the Salvation of <hi>Chriſt</hi>; yet <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Eternal Life</hi> are peculiarly and properly the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings promiſed in the Law of Works, in which Senſe the Word <hi>Salvation</hi> is never uſed; and the Scripture in ſome Places by this way of Expreſſion makes this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction evident. See the Terms of the <hi>Law</hi> or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, both in its <hi>Command</hi> and its <hi>Reward,</hi> as it is deſcribed in direct oppoſition to the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and Method of Salvation, in Rom. x. 5, 6. <hi>Moſes deſcribeth the Righteouſneſs which is of the Law, that the Man who
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:006440_0097_1028F00D279CEA38"/>
doth theſe Things ſhall live by them</hi>; whereas the <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Faith (i. e.</hi> the way of Juſtification and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God by the Goſpel) <hi>ſays</hi> quite other things, <hi>If thou ſhalt believe and confeſs</hi> Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So St. <hi>Paul</hi> deſcribes the promiſed Bleſſings of the Law of Works in the ſame manner in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians,</hi> Gal. iii. 12. <hi>The Law is not of Faith, but the Man who doth them ſhall live in them. Life</hi> is ſtill the Word of the Promiſe. And in <hi>Rom.</hi> ii. 6, 7. where the Apoſtle is properly preaching the Law of Works with the Terms of it, 'tis called <hi>Immortality, Eternal Life,</hi> to be obtained by <hi>continuance in good Works</hi> or <hi>well-doing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis this <hi>Eternal Life</hi> and <hi>Immortality</hi> which was imply'd in the Covenant of Works which God made with <hi>Adam.</hi> If he eat the forbidden Fruit he ſhould <hi>die</hi>; but if he obſerved the Commands of God, he ſhould <hi>live</hi>; and the <hi>Tree of Life</hi> in the midſt of the Garden was a Symbol or Sacrament of <hi>Life</hi> and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality to ſeal this Promiſe to Man, if he continued in his Obedience to God.</p>
               <p>Our Lord therefore gives an Anſwer exactly accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Queſtion, <hi>What good Thing ſhall I do for Eternal Life?</hi> ſaith the Enquirer. <hi>Keep the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> ſaith our Lord. When the young Man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes his Queſtion about final Happineſs in the Terms and Language of the Covenant of Works, our Lord gives an Anſwer in the ſame Language. <q>If thou wilt obtain Life by doing Works, theſe are the Works which thou muſt do, even the Works of the moral Law.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> I ſuppoſe <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the chief Miniſter of the Covenant of Grace would not give this Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to obtain the Salvation and Benefits thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis the moſt direct Anſwer which a Preacher of the Covenant of Works could give to this ſame En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry; <hi>If thou wilt enter into Life keep the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="unknown:006440_0098_1028F00EC6DA0740"/>
And this is very different from the Terms of Juſtification and Salvation by the Goſpel, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Works of the Law, as the way to Pardon and Juſtification, and refer us to <hi>Faith in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> See <hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 11, 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> x. 5, 6. already cited. Is it not moſt expreſly aſſerted, that <hi>by the Works of the Law no Fleſh ſhall be juſtified?</hi> Rom. iii. 19, 20. Are not theſe Works perpetually excluded by the bleſſed Apoſtle, whenſoever he is deſcribing the mere Method of Grace and Salvation, or the Means for a Sinner to obtain his Acceptance with God unto Eternal Life? See Rom. iv. 4. <hi>To him that worketh the Reward is not reckon'd of Grace but of Debt: But to him that worketh not believeth on him that juſtifies the ungodly (i. e.</hi> the Man who has no Works of Righteouſneſs anſwerable to any Law) <hi>his Faith is counted for Righteouſneſs.</hi> Gal. ii. 16. <hi>Knowing that a Man is not juſtify'd by the Works of the Law, but by the Faith of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. See <hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 8, 12.</p>
               <p>And it is plain, that it is not merely the <hi>Law of Levitical Ceremonies</hi> that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, when he excludes the Works of it from our Juſtification, for it is alſo that <hi>Law which is written by Nature in the Hearts</hi> and Conſciences of the <hi>Gentiles, Rom.</hi> ii. 14, 15. It is the Law that forbids <hi>Stealing and Adultery, Rom.</hi> ii. 21, 22. The Law that forbids <hi>Coveting, Rom.</hi> vii. 6, 7. even this very Law, and thoſe Commandments which our Saviour makes mention of in my Text. <hi>'Tis by the Works of this Law no Fleſh ſhall be juſtified,</hi> no Man ſhall be ſaved, or obtain Eternal Happineſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> iii. 20. Now can we ſuppoſe that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the great Meſſenger of God to ſinful Man, and the Prophet of the Goſpel or Covenant of Grace, would give the very ſame ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Direction to a Sinner how to obtain Salvation, which a Preacher of the Law, or a Zealot for the Covenant of Works, would give to one who thought
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:006440_0099_1028F03F6DF9E1D8"/>
himſelf righteous, and never confeſs'd himſelf a Sinner, but enquired about obtaining Life by his good Works?</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> 'Tis hardly to be thought that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould direct a Man to fulfil the Commands of the Moral Law as the proper way for him to obtain Eternal Life, when through the Weakneſs of our ſinful Nature, he knew the Law could not give Life to Men in their fallen Eſtate, and he himſelf was ſent to provide another way for them to obtain Life. Rom. viii. 3. <hi>What the Law could not do in that it was weak through the Fleſh, God ſent his own Son</hi> to do for us. Rom. iii. 20. <hi>By the Deeds of the Law there ſhall no Fleſh be juſtified in his Sight.</hi> This does not ariſe from any Weakneſs or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency of the Law itſelf, for it ſtill promiſes Life, and would ſecure it to any Man who was perfect with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sin. But as the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>'Tis become weak thro' the Fleſh, i. e.</hi> becauſe Man is ſo much immerſed in Fleſh and Sin, that he cannot perfectly fulfil it. The Law cannot give the Favour of God and Eternal Life, becauſe Man cannot obey it.</p>
               <p>And upon this Account <hi>the Law</hi> of ten Commands which was <hi>engraven in Stones</hi> is called <hi>the Miniſtration of Condemnati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n and Death,</hi> 2 Cor. iii. 7, 9. and not the <hi>Miniſtration of Life and Righteouſneſs</hi>; that is the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Glory of the Goſpel. <hi>The Law</hi> indeed <hi>is holy and juſt and good,</hi> and it was originally ordained <hi>for Life</hi> to innocent Man: But when the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> came to have his Conſcience awaken'd to a Senſe of Sin by the Law, he found it to <hi>be unto Death,</hi> Rom. vii. 10. partly by ſhewing him his Imperfection of Obedience, as well as by irritating his indwelling ſinful Inclinations. So far is the Law from giving Life to Sinners.</p>
               <p>God honours his Laws ſo much that the Scripture aſſures us, <hi>If there had been a Law which could have given Life,</hi> Eternal Life, <hi>verily Righteouſneſs,</hi> Juſtification and Happineſs <hi>ſhould have come by the Law.</hi> Gal. iii. 21, 22.
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:006440_0100_1028DADE362298C8"/>
                  <hi>But the Scripture hath concluded all under Sin,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned them by the Law, and has ſhewn the Inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of the Law to ſave, <hi>that the Promiſe</hi> of Eternal Life <hi>by Faith of Jeſus Chriſt might be given to them that believe.</hi> 'Tis not to be ſuppoſed therefore, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the Son of God, who was ſent into this World to give or further reveal <hi>this Promiſe</hi> of Eternal Life <hi>by Faith,</hi> and to provide another way to Salvation and Eternal Life for fallen Man, becauſe the Law was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to give it; I ſay, 'tis not to be ſuppoſed that this very Son of God ſhould preach Obedience to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of this Law, as the proper and direct way for a Sinner to obtain Salvation of Eternal Life. This would be like <hi>building up again</hi> the Hopes of Sinners to obtain Salvation by the Law, <hi>which</hi> Hopes <hi>he came to deſtroy,</hi> and to provide a much ſurer Foundation for Hope.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> 'Tis much more probable that <hi>Chriſt</hi> in theſe Words deſign'd to lead this young Man to a Senſe of Sin and Guilt, and Self-Condemnation, by preaching to him the Law of God, rather than to give him immediately the direct and plain Advice how a Sinner might obtain Eternal Happineſs; for this is a Work which the Law can do, even in our fallen State: For <hi>by the Law is the Knowledge of Sin,</hi> Rom. iii. 20, and vii. 7. The Law can convince and condemn, though it cannot juſtify and ſave. Our Saviour knew the Hearts of Men; he knew this young Man was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited of his own Righteouſneſs, and he had a mind to lead his Conſcience to a Sight and Senſe of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of his Obedience, and therefore he preaches the Law to him in many of the expreſs Commands of it, for that very End which the Law might attain, <hi>i. e. Conviction of Sin and Self-Condemnation.</hi> This is the firſt thing neceſſary in order to the Salvation of Men, and therefore our Saviour begins with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="unknown:006440_0101_1028DB0A4AD6B820"/>And 'tis well worthy our Notice, that the publick Promulgation of the ten Commandments, with ſuch ſolemn Terrors at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> was deſign'd, in the ſpiritual Intention of it, to lay the Conſciences of Men under Guilt, rather than to make them partakers of Righteouſneſs and Life, <hi>Rom.</hi> v. 20. <hi>The Law enter'd that the Offence might abound,</hi> i. e. that the Sins of Men might appear to be great and numerous, beyond what their carnal Imaginations would have ſuppoſed, without the expreſs Letter of the Law, which forbids <hi>coveting,</hi> &amp;c. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> vii. 7. <hi>He had not known this Concupiſcence to be Sin but by the Law</hi>; and that uſeful Expoſitor of Scripture, Mr. <hi>Samuel Clark,</hi> (who is not wont to be too Evangelical in his Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions) remarks on <hi>Exod.</hi> xix. 24. <q>That the Charge of forbidding the People to come near Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> is often repeated, <hi>leſt God break forth upon them,</hi> to ſhew that the End of the Law is rather to exclude Men from God, by reaſon of their Sins, than to juſtify or to give Life; for which he cites, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> iii. 7. <hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 10 — 24.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed this was one conſiderable part of the Deſign and Buſineſs of our Saviour's perſonal Miniſtry here upon Earth, (<hi>viz.) to preach the Law of God in its Perfection, and convince Men of Sin,</hi> to let them ſee that they were condemned and expoſed to the Wrath of God, that they might learn the Neceſſity of a Saviour to atone for Sin, and of the Mercy of God to pardon it. He deſcribed the Purity and Exactneſs of the Law, not only to teach his Diſciples and all ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Chriſtians, that their Obedience to the Law of God ought to be more exact and pure, more inward and ſpiritual, than what the <hi>Phariſees</hi> required or prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, but alſo to ſhew Men the Imperfection of their beſt Righteouſneſs, and that they were all guilty before God, that he might prepare them to receive the Goſpel,
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:006440_0102_1028F010B7C3D930"/>
partly by his own preaching it, and eſpecially when it ſhould be publiſhed in greater Brightneſs and Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and in its full Glory, after his Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>Was not this one great Deſign of his Sermon upon the Mount, where he explains the Law of God in its Lengths and Breadths, and ſhews that it reaches to the Thoughts of Men as well as their Actions? Did he not begin this Sermon with, <hi>Bleſſed are the Poor in Spirit,</hi> Matt. v. 3. that he might ſhew the way to Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was not a <hi>Self-Sufficience of Soul,</hi> and a <hi>Truſt</hi> in our own Righteouſneſs, but a <hi>ſpiritual Poverty, i. e.</hi> a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Senſe of our own Weakneſs and Sinfulneſs? What mean many of his Parables, particularly that of the <hi>prodigal Son returning</hi> in Rags and Sorrow <hi>to his Father's Houſe?</hi> Doth it not teach us that the way to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of our heavenly Father is to return to him with a deep Senſe of our Diſobedience, Sin and Miſery, with a humble Repentance, and asking Forgiveneſs? What is the Intent of the Parable of the <hi>Phariſee and Publican going up to pray?</hi> Is it not to ſhew us that a humble, confeſſing, repenting Sinner ſeeking for Mercy, is much nearer to Juſtification and the Favour of God, than a Man who ſpreads abroad his own Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and juſtifies himſelf? What means our Bleſſed Lord in his perpetual Reproofs of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> who <hi>truſted in themſelves that they were righteous?</hi> Did he not frequently talk thus to convince Men of Sin, and ſhew them how imperfect their Obedience was, and how inſufficient to procure Acceptance with God, and to let them ſee that Repentance and Confeſſion of Sin, and Truſt in Divine Mercy, were the only way to Salvation.</p>
               <p>'Tis no wonder then if our Saviour had the ſame Deſign in his Eye when he ſaw a rich young Man of a <hi>Phariſaical</hi> Spirit, come to enquire the way to Heaven by <hi>doing ſome good Work</hi>; 'tis no wonder that he begun
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:006440_0103_1028F014BB6ADC78"/>
to talk to him of Obedience to the Law, in order to convince him of Sin, and ſhew him that he was not ſufficiently righteous to obtain Eternal Life by his Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>'Tis moſt likely that our Bleſſed Lord had a ſpecial Intention in this Place to try the young Man, whether he knew his own State and Caſe as a Sinner who wanted Pardon, and whether he was prepared for the Goſpel or no: Whether he ſtood convinced of Sin, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of true Salvation, ſuch as <hi>Chriſt</hi> came to procure for thoſe who were ſenſible of their Guilt and Danger. I have before ſhewed that the firſt Sentence that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpoke to him was with deſign to try his Opinion about himſelf, the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> when he called him <hi>Good,</hi> whether he was one with God or no: And now he tries his Opinion about the inward and ſpiritual Perfection of the Law, and about his own Power to keep it, and about his own Hope of Juſtification thereby: And therefore he at firſt gives him ſuch an Anſwer as ſhould make him bethink himſelf, whether he had obey'd the Law of God perfectly or no.</p>
               <p>If he had found him ſenſible of his Guilt and his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, then moſt probably the compaſſionate <hi>Jeſus</hi> would have preached to him the pardoning Grace of the Goſpel, which he came to offer to thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of Sin, and believe in the Saviour. But when he heard the vain Enquirer juſtify himſelf as a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Man, and ſay, <hi>All theſe Commands have I kept from my Youth,</hi> then our Saviour put him to a freſh and more painful Trial of his Sincerity and Obedience to God, and that partly for his Conviction, inſtead of ſaying, <hi>Repent and believe;</hi> he did not proceed ſo far as to preach Repentance to him, becauſe he ſaw him ſo much unconvinced of Sin; and he tells us that he came <hi>not to call theſe righteous Men but Sinners to Repen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Matt. ix. 13. <hi>i. e.</hi> thoſe who own themſelves to be Sinners.</p>
               <p>This leads me to the <hi>fifth</hi> or laſt Reaſon, to prove that this Anſwer was not deſigned by <hi>Chriſt</hi> as a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Queriſt how to obtain Salvation, (<hi>viz.</hi>) It is a quite different Anſwer to the like Queſtions that is given by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and by the Apoſtles, when they deſigned to preach the Goſpel in plain, direct and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Language, Mark i. 15. <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith <hi>Repent and believe the Goſpel.</hi> John vi. 40. <hi>This is the Will of him that ſent me, that every one that ſeeth the Son and believeth on him, hath everlaſting Life.</hi> And again, <hi>This is the Work of God,</hi> i. e. the great Work which God now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, <hi>that ye believe on him whom he hath ſent,</hi> John vi. 28, 29. So preaches St. <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts ii. 38. <hi>Repent and be baptiſed in the Name of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt: So <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts xvi. 31. <hi>Believe in the Lord</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>and thou ſhalt be ſaved:</hi> And ſo <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>This is his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment that ye believe on the Name of his Son</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, 1 John iii. 23. Theſe are the plain and direct Advices of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles to ſinful Men, in order to obtain the Favour of God and Eternal Life.</p>
               <p>To ſuppoſe therefore that <hi>Chriſt</hi> did in this Place, and in theſe Words, direct the Enquirer into the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per way of Salvation by the Goſpel, is to ſuppoſe that <hi>Chriſt</hi> differ'd greatly from himſelf, in the Directions he gave, how Men might be ſaved; and that he and his Apoſtles, and particularly St. <hi>Paul,</hi> taught very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Doctrines; that <hi>Chriſt</hi> taught the Way to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by the Works of the Law, and the Goſpel taught it by Faith and Repentance, without the Works of the Law. But this would ſet <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles ſo much at Variance with themſelves, that 'tis not to be admitted.</p>

               <p>I come now to anſwer ſome <hi>Objections</hi> againſt my Senſe of this Text, and the chief of them are taken from Dr. <hi>Whitby,</hi> a moſt ingenious Writer on that Side.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. Doth not <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſay, that <hi>to love the Lord our God is the Way to Life,</hi> Luke x. 27, 28? Is not this the ſame thing in effect, as when he directs the young Man to Eternal Life, by <hi>keeping the Commandments,</hi> and that in the ſame Language? For when the Lawyer enquires, <hi>What ſhall I do to inherit Eternal Life? Jeſus</hi> gives him this Advice, <hi>Love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, and thy Neighbour as thy ſelf: This do and thou ſhalt live.</hi> Thus Eternal Life is promiſed by <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, to our loving God and Man, which is the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome or Abſtract of all the moral Commands in one, for <hi>Love is the fulfilling of the Law,</hi> Rom. xiii. 8, 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is very plain that in that Place our Saviour is preaching the Covenant of Works, as well as in my Text, and that for the ſame Purpoſe too, (<hi>viz.</hi>) for the Conviction of Sin. This Lawyer was not a humble and ſincere Enquirer, but one who came to tempt and enſnare him; and then 'tis no wonder if <hi>Jeſus</hi> did not give him a plain and direct Anſwer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Method of Salvation by the Goſpel. And though he directed others to believe and repent, yet he did not treat a vain young <hi>Phariſee,</hi> who thought himſelf righteous, and a cunning Lawyer who deſign'd to inſnare him, in the ſame manner that he would treat Perſons who were ſenſible of their Sins, and ſought the way to obtain Pardon and Happineſs, nor did he give them the ſame Directions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. Let it be further conſider'd, that the Life-time of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not the appointed Seaſon to ſpeak

the Glories of the Goſpel in the fulleſt and plaineſt Language, as I hinted before. His frequent Buſineſs and Practice was to preach the Law, to reprove Sin, and prepare Men for the fuller and more compleat Miniſtry of the Goſpel, which after his Death he ſent his Apoſtles to preach by the Power of his own Spirit: And they publiſh'd the Goſpel of Salvation by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Faith in the Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs through his Atonement, much plainer and clearer, and fuller than <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf did in his Life-time among the Multitudes. That Goſpel which he taught them ſecretly, <hi>they proclaimed</hi> as it were <hi>upon the Houſe Tops,</hi> according to his Order, <hi>Matt.</hi> x. 27.</p>
               <p>Though <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf gave ſuch Hints of this Goſpel in his preaching, as were ſufficient for Salvation to thoſe that would receive them, yet he might be ſaid to be ſent rather with this dreadful Commiſſion to the Generality of the <hi>Jews,</hi> Matt. xiii. 13. Iſa. vi. 10. <hi>Make the Heart of this People fat and their Ears heavy, and ſhut their Eyes,</hi> &amp;c.

Can we imagine that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in whom dwells all Wiſdom, Truth and Love, ſhould give ſuch Directions as could never bring a Man to Heaven, and eſpecially conſidering that he came into the World on purpoſe <hi>to bring Life and Immortality to Light</hi> among Men, and to ſhew them the true Way to Heaven?</p>

That we may ſecure the Goodneſs of God and the Mercy of <hi>Chriſt</hi> from any Reproach in this Caſe, I ſay further, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> did take a very wiſe and regular Method with this young Man to bring him to Salvation, if he would have ſtay'd to attend to it, and had not been full of evil Prejudices, of Self Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the Love of this World. For the firſt thing to be done in order to bring Sinners to Heaven (as I hinted before) is to convince them of Sin, and this is done by the Law. This the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth at large in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> that Men by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the Perfection of the Law, and their Inability to perform it, might become <hi>Dead to all Hope from the Law,</hi> as he was when he ſays, Gal. ii. 19. <hi>I by the Law am dead to the Law</hi>; and that they might not expect Life by the Law, but that they might ſeek for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Way of Repentance and Faith, or Truſt in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and obtain Forgiveneſs of Sins through the free Grace of God in the Goſpel.</p>

<pb n="93" facs="unknown:006440_0108_1028F021126B2A08"/>
He had ſome liking to ſuch a towardly and hopeful Youth, and preach'd the Law to him, to convince him of Sin, in order to his Salvation: But when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed himſelf to be ſo righteous in his own Eyes, as to <hi>have kept all the Commands</hi> of the Law, his divine Wiſdom then ſaw it proper to put a harder Trial upon him (<hi>viz.) to ſell all that he had and give to the Poor, and to become a Follower of Chriſt.</hi> Now if this young Man had loved God ſo well as he pretended, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be a Prophet come from God, he ought to have obey'd him, even in this difficult and ſelf-denying Command; which Command was put upon him, partly to convince him that he did not love God ſo well as he imagined, and which hard Trial probably would never have been put upon him, if he had not been ſo conceited of his own Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>It muſt be obſerved alſo, to vindicate the Honour, Faithfulneſs and Goodneſs of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that if the young Man had followed theſe Directions of <hi>Chriſt</hi> at the End of the Conference, he had been ſaved: Our Bleſſed Lord gave him ſufficient Advice for Eternal Life, if he would have taken it. <q>Come, <hi>ſell what thou haſt, and give it to the Poor, and follow me,</hi> and be my Diſciple;</q> and then it would follow, <q>Thou ſhalt learn of me the Way to Heaven more perfectly, and I will teach thee the Way of Repentance, and Faith, and Holineſs unto compleat Salvation.</q> But the young Man loved his Money, and went away ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful, that he could not keep all his Riches and obtain Eternal Life too.</p>

                  <hi>He that doth them</hi> (that is the Commands of God) <hi>ſhall live in them,</hi> Ezek. xx. 11. this Promiſe is repeated: And in Ezek. xxx. 15. <hi>If the Wicked walk in the Statutes of Life, without committing Iniquity, he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not die:</hi> Now this <hi>dying</hi> cannot mean <hi>a natural Death,</hi> for they knew they muſt die Naturally; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt mean <hi>a Deliverance from Eternal Death, and Aſſurance of Eternal Life.</hi> 
                  <q>'Tis therefore certain, that all pious Perſons, under the Old Teſtament, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a Right to Life eternal, by this Obſervance of the moral Precepts of the Law.</q> Theſe are Dr. <hi>Whitby</hi>'s own Words.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. This Life which is here promiſed in theſe Texts to the <hi>Jews,</hi> in a literal Senſe, chiefly means <hi>long Life in their own Land,</hi> and Peace and Freedom from Sorrows and Miſeries in this World: And though the Freedom or Preſervation from <hi>Death</hi> (which is promiſed by <hi>Moſes</hi> to thoſe who keep the Statutes, Laws and Ordinances enjoin'd to <hi>Iſrael</hi>) does not mean an intire Preſervation from <hi>Temporal Death</hi>; ſo neither in the obvious and literal Senſe does it mean a Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from <hi>Eternal Death,</hi> but rather a Freedom from <hi>Death,</hi> as it is a general Term uſed to include all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and painful Evils, and particularly from ſudden and violent Death, from cruel, lingering and ſhameful Death, from Death in foreign Countries, and untimely Death in the midſt of their Years. This is very evident, if you read thoſe Expreſſions of <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> vi. 24, 25. and <hi>Deut.</hi> xxx. 15 — 30. <hi>Ezek.</hi> xxxiii. 10, 15. So <hi>Solomon,</hi> in his Prayer, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> viii. 31, — 50. <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> in his Prayer, <hi>Neh.</hi> ix. 29 — 31. teach us to explain it. <hi>Life</hi> is put for all that is good, and <hi>Death</hi> for all that is Evil.</p>
               <p>'Tis evident that God governed the <hi>Jews</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to temporal Bleſſings and temporal Curſes, in the Way of a Covenant of Works. As to the external
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:006440_0110_1028F02636215490"/>
and temporal State of their Perſons, their Church, and their Nation, they were under a Covenant of Works; and God, who was their King or political Head, dealt with them from time to time in ſaving them, or in puniſhing them according to their Works: And 'tis very obſervable, that 'tis this very Promiſe of <hi>Life,</hi> upon condition of <hi>doing the Works</hi> of the Law which the Apoſtle takes to deſcribe that <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> by which the <hi>Jews</hi> could not be ſaved as to their eternal State, ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> x. 3, 5. and ix. 31. <hi>The Man that doth them ſhall live in them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be <hi>objected,</hi> that God allow'd of their Repentance for Sin in this his Law or Covenant as their King, and ſometimes he ſaved the Nation upon their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and therefore it muſt include the <hi>Goſpel</hi> or <hi>Covenant of Grace;</hi> yet I anſwer, it may ſtill be called a <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> becauſe a mere external viſible Humiliation and Reformation, without a real Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence at Heart, was accepted by God as their King, as ſufficient to divert Divine Judgments from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſometimes from particular Perſons, who had provoked God's Anger by external and viſible Iniquities. 1 Kings xxi. 2. <hi>Seeſt thou how Ahab humbleth himſelf? I will not bring this Evil in his Days</hi>; whereas all his Humiliation was his <hi>rending his Clothes, wearing of Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth and Faſting,</hi> and a little outward Appearance of Reformation, but 'tis evident that his Heart was not changed. See 1 <hi>King.</hi> xxii. 27.</p>
               <p>It may be granted, indeed, there was much Grace and Mercy mingled in this Political Law or Covenant of Life, between <hi>God</hi> as a Civil King, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> as his Subjects in this World; but ſtill this was not the Goſpel or Covenant of Grace and Salvation, whereby the pious <hi>Jews</hi> were ſaved from the Wrath of God, as their ſpiritual Lord and Ruler in the other World, and whereby they had their Sins pardoned, and were
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:006440_0111_1028F028E42CBA18"/>
made Partakers of Eternal Life; for the Rites of the Law could not cleanſe the Conſcience from Sin in the Sight of God. <hi>Heb.</hi> ix. 9. and this leads me to the next Anſwer.</p>

Beſides the frequent Charges which are given to the <hi>Jews</hi> to keep the Commandments of God, in order to obtain Life, we find alſo frequent Calls to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and hearty <hi>Repentance of Sin,</hi> to make <hi>their Hearts clean,</hi> to <hi>forſake their evil Thoughts,</hi> to <hi>rend their Hearts and not their Garments,</hi> and ſo <hi>truſt in the pardoning Mercy of God</hi>; and there are many Promiſes of Pardon to the Penitent, and the Favour of God <hi>to thoſe that fear him and hope in his Mercy,</hi> in order to lead them to obtain the Happineſs of the other World and Eternal Life. See Iſai. lv. 7, 8. <hi>Let the Wicked forſake his Way, and the unrighteous Man his Thoughts; and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have Mercy upon him, and to our God, and he will abundantly pardon.</hi> Pſal. cxxx. 4, <hi>&amp;c. There is For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs with thee that thou may'ſt be feared. Let Iſrael hope in the Lord; with the Lord is plenteous Redemption.

<pb n="97" facs="unknown:006440_0112_1028F02A6F7DFD50"/>
God unto Eternal Life, under the Old Teſtament: For there is nothing of this Doctrine of Repentance and Forgiveneſs, nor of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> contained in the Ten Commands.</p>
               <p>Let it be obſerved alſo, that even in thoſe legal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, which enſure <hi>Life</hi> to thoſe who kept the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, there is a more ſpiritual and Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Senſe ſometimes imply'd: For under this Word <hi>Life,</hi> and theſe temporal Bleſſings which were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, <hi>Eternal Life</hi> and eternal Bleſſings were typify'd and held forth to thoſe that looked through the Veil, and that fulfilled the Will of God in ſpiritual and ſincere Obedience, with an humble Senſe of their Sins, and Truſt in divine Forgiveneſs. But the Ground of their Acceptance with God unto Eternal Life, or their Right to Heaven and Salvation, was not this their Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the Works of the Law; for their beſt Works were all imperfect, and <hi>they were ſaved by Faith even as we.</hi> Gal. iii. 6 — 9. <hi>i. e.</hi> by truſting to pardoning Mercy, ſo far as it was revealed under that Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
               <p>And as the <hi>Salvation</hi> itſelf was typify'd by temporal Bleſſings, ſo the Way to this Salvation, which was <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> and <hi>Truſt in the Mercy of God through the Meſſiah,</hi> was typify'd by offering Sacrifices of Blood, and by many Waſhings and Purifyings, both by Blood and Water, which implied a Confeſſion of their Defilement: And the Saints or righteous Men of that Day, hoped for the Mercy of God, as diſcover'd more plainly in the Promiſes, and perhaps alſo, ſome might underſtand it as hinted in theſe Types and Figures. They knew that <hi>Bleſſedneſs was to come upon Men to whom God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted not their Sins,</hi> or to whom <hi>the Lord imputed Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> or accounted them as righteous in his Sight by his Mercy, though they were very imperfect, and far from Righteouſneſs, <hi>i. e.</hi> a perfect juſtifying Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:006440_0113_1028F02E2FEA20E8"/>
even if they put together all their Works of Obedience to the Commands of God. <hi>David</hi> often ſpeaks of the Impoſſibility of our attaining the Acceptance of God by our Works, <hi>Pſal.</hi> cxxx. and cxliii. 14 and 19. <hi>If thou ſhouldest mark Iniquities, O Lord, who ſhall stand?

                     <p>And here, by the way, I would take Occaſion to relieve or explain one great Difficulty, which occurs in the reading of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles; eſpecially thoſe to the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Galatians.</hi> 'Tis evident that when St. <hi>Paul</hi> deſigns to repreſent the Terms of the Covenant of Works, <hi>(viz.) Do this and live,</hi> and <hi>Curſed is every one that continues not in all Things written in the Book of the Law to do them,</hi> Rom. x. 5. Gal. iii. 10, 12. he doth it by Citations out of the Old Teſtament, or the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Scriptures, becauſe the Language of the Political Covenant which God made with the <hi>Jews,</hi> (as he was their King, and they were his Nation or People) was the Language of the Covenant of Works, and God governed them very much in that way with regard to their temporal Rewards and Puniſhments.</p>
                     <p>On the other Hand, when St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives as the Terms of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, or the Goſpel, (<hi>viz.) Faith in the Grace of God thro' a Saviour,</hi> he alſo cites the Old Teſtament, or the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Scriptures. So <hi>Rom.</hi> iii. 21. <hi>Rom.</hi> iv, 3, 6, 7. <hi>Rom.</hi> x. 6 — 11. <hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 8, 11. Becauſe the Covenant of Grace, or the way of Salvation and Eternal Life, was alſo preſcribed, tho' in a more obſcure manner, in the Old Teſtament, partly by Promiſes made to Repentance and Truſt in the Mercy of God, and a <hi>Meſſiah</hi> that was to come, and partly by Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Waſhings, which were Types and Figures of Repentance and Pardon, thro' the Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and Sanctification of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> Thus the <hi>Righteouſneſs of God was witneſſed by the Law and the Prophets.</hi> Rom. iii. 21. I think without this Clue 'tis impoſſible to read and underſtand the great Apoſtle's Way of arguing in thoſe Epiſtles.

               <p>Thus it appears, that the bare keeping the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of the Law was neither under the Old Teſtament nor the New, the Way to Salvation and Eternal Life for Sinners: But ſince <hi>the Law was weak,</hi> and unable to ſave, by reaſon of <hi>the weakneſs of our Fleſh</hi> or ſinful Nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 3. that is, ſince the Law promiſes Life only to thoſe who obey the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands perfectly, and Men could not obtain Life this Way by reaſon of the Imperfection of their Obedience, there were many Calls to Repentance, and to truſt in the Mercy of God, given to the <hi>Jews,</hi> in the Old Teſtament, as the preſcribed Way for Sinners to obtain Salvation; which Duties, together with the Grounds of them, and the Bleſſings promiſed to them, are much more clearly revealed in the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>I might confirm theſe Anſwers to Dr. <hi>Whitby,</hi> out of his own Expoſition on <hi>Rom.</hi> x. 9. <q>Juſtification (ſaith he) is here expreſly aſcribed to Faith; and that not as including Works, but only as being that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple which, when it is cordial and ſincere, will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly produce them: I ſay, <hi>not as including all thoſe Works</hi> which by the Goſpel are required to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, for then the <hi>Righteouſneſs of Faith</hi> muſt be deſcribed as the <hi>Righteouſneſs of the Law (viz.</hi>) that <hi>the Man who doth theſe things ſhall live in them,</hi> which is contrary to the Words of the Apoſtle, <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6.</q> So far does the Force of Truth, in ſome Places, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain honeſt Minds to admit and confeſs what in other Places they are very unwilling to allow, and which they almoſt contradict: But this muſt be charged on the common or univerſal Influence of human Frailty and miſtaken Prejudices, and for want of an equal, uniform, ſimultaneous and comprehenſive View of all

the Parts of Religion together, which no human Mind perhaps in the preſent State can arrive at.</p>

                  <hi>Object.</hi> 4. There is another Objection which may be ſtarted againſt my Expoſition of this Text, that is drawn from Rev. ii. 2, 14. <hi>Bleſſed are they that do his Commandments, that they may have right to the Tree of Life, and may enter through the Gates into the City,</hi> i. e. into Heaven, and enjoy Eternal Life. Surely, ſay ſome, theſe Words muſt be acknowledged to be the Language of the Goſpel, or the Covenant of Grace, and not of the Law or the Covenant of Works: For they are the Words of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, after his Aſcenſion to Heaven, and yet 'tis plain that doing the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments is here repreſented as the Way to obtain Eternal Life in Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But 'tis as plain that <hi>Doing the ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the moral Law,</hi> are not the only things that are meant here in this Text: But theſe Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which <hi>give a right to the Tree of Life,</hi> &amp;c. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude at leaſt, if not chiefly deſign, the peculiar Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God in the Goſpel, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Repentance for Sin, Faith in the pardoning Mercy of God through a Redeemer, which is productive of Love to God and Man. To prove this, read Matt. iv. 17. <hi>Repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at Hand,</hi> Mark i. 15. <hi>Repent and believe the Goſpel,</hi> Mark xvi. 16. <hi>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved.</hi> John iii. 22, 23. <hi>And whatſoever we ask we receive of him, becauſe we keep his Commandments, and do thoſe things that are pleaſing in his Sight: And this is his Commandment, that we ſhould believe on the Name of his Son</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>and love one another as he gave us Commandment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as <hi>Adam</hi> by doing the peculiar Commands which God gave to him, might have obtained a Right to the Benefits of the literal <hi>Tree of Life</hi> in the Garden of <hi>Eden, (i. e.</hi> Immortality) So <hi>Chriſtians</hi> by doing the
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:006440_0116_1028F035D0CA81F8"/>
peculiar Commandments of the Goſpel, may be ſaid, in ſome Senſe, to obtain <hi>a Right to the</hi> Benefits of the ſpiritual <hi>Tree of Life</hi> (i. e. <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi>) and may enter into Heaven: But a mere Obedience to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of the moral Law is never preſcribed as the Way to obtain a Right to the Benefits of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but rather an Obedience to the Commands of the Goſpel, which are peculiarly Repentance and Faith in <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be yet further obſerved, that the Commands to which <hi>Chriſt</hi> directed the young Man in my Text, in order to <hi>enter into Life,</hi> were not <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> but only the ten Commands of the moral Law: for he directs the young Man preciſely to the Commands of the moral Law, and tells him, <hi>thou knoweſt what theſe Commands are.</hi> Now this young Man was ſo full of his own Obedience to that Law, and ſo confident of it, that he ſeems not to know the Commands of <hi>Confeſſion of Sin and Repentance for it</hi>; much leſs did he think of the other Command of <hi>Faith in the Mercy of God through a Mediator.</hi> So that if it be never ſo much allow'd, that Obedience to theſe humbling and ſelf-abaſing Commands of the Goſpel, <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> may give a Right to the Benefits of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into Heaven, yet an Obedience to the <hi>ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the moral Law</hi> could not make a Sinner's Way to Heaven and Eternal Life: But theſe ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are thoſe which <hi>Chriſt</hi> points out to the young <hi>Phariſaical</hi> Inquirer.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole it appears, that when our Saviour ſaith to the young Man in my Text, <hi>If thou wilt enter into Life keep the Commandments,</hi> he did not mean to give him the plain and direct Preſcription of the Goſpel in order to the Salvation of a Sinner, but rather began with him in preaching the Law, in order to ſhew him his Duty by the Law, and to convince him of Sin.</p>
               <p>And from this View of things, I think we may draw

this plain Obſervation (<hi>viz.</hi>) That whereſoever the keeping the Commands of God is propoſed to Men in Scripture as the Way to Life, it either means that the Way to obtain long temporal Life and temporal Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, was to obſerve the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Laws, according to the political Covenant of God made with the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation at <hi>Sinai;</hi> or it means that perfect Obedience of Thought, Word, and Action to all theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands which God gives us, is the Way to obtain Life Eternal by the Covenant of Works and Law of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency: Or if at any time the Context plainly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines this Phraſe, <hi>keeping the Commandments,</hi> to ſignify the Way to obtain Salvation under the Goſpel, then the Word <hi>Commands</hi> muſt extend to include the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Commands of <hi>Repentance for Sin,</hi> and <hi>Truſt in the pardoning Mercy of God through a Mediator.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Reaſon is plain; for this is the great Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference always obſerved between the Law and Goſpel, or between the Covenant of Works and the Covenant of Grace, (<hi>viz.</hi>) that the Covenant of Works or the Law, teaches us to claim Life as a Debt by our own exact Obedience to the Commands of the Law; but the Covenant of Grace or the Goſpel, teaches us hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to ſeek for Life or Salvation by Confeſſion of Sin and Repentance, and by depending on the free Mercy of God, through a Mediator, for the Forgiveneſs of Sin and Acceptance with God<note n="*" place="bottom">Here I would caution my Readers to take notice, that I am not now debating that Point, <hi>In what manner the Righteouſneſs, Atonement or Death of</hi> Chriſt <hi>is apply'd to us in order to our Intereſt in Forgiveneſs of Sins, the Juſtification of our Perſons, or our Right to final Happineſs</hi>: That is an Argument of a different Conſideration from the preſent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. All that I propoſe here to treat of is to determine that obvious Queſtion, whether <hi>Chriſt</hi> is plainly and directly ſhewing a conceited young Man the way of obtaining Salvation according to the Goſpel or Covenant of Grace, when he ſays to him, <hi>If thou wilt enter into Life keep the Commandments</hi> of the moral Law; or whether he is not rather leading him to Convinction of Sin, by preaching the Law to him, that he may be better prepared and inclined to receive the Salvation of the Goſpel.</note>.</p>

                  <hi>SECT. IV.</hi> Of what Uſe is it to keep the Law then?</head>
               <p>Before I proceed I would anſwer another <hi>Objection</hi> or <hi>Query</hi> or two, upon this Subject, (<hi>viz.) Of what Uſe is the Law of God in a Chriſtian Country? Or what Uſe is there of keeping the Commandments of the moral Law, if we are not to obtain Eternal Life by them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let the <hi>firſt Enquiry</hi> be anſwered <hi>firſt. Of what Uſe is the Law of God in a Chriſtian Country, where the Goſpel of Chriſt is preach'd?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is to be feared there are ſeveral thouſand Souls in a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Nation, who make a general Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Religion of the bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and yet have no ſerious Senſe of the things of God and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in their Hearts: And it is evident to daily Obſervation, that in a Land profeſſing the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> there are Multitudes who have abandon'd all Piety even in the Form of it, as well as the Practice and Power thereof, and there are ſome who have loſt even Morality itſelf; now the <hi>Law of God</hi> is needful to be maintain'd, and publiſh'd in ſuch a Nation as this, to keep the ſinful World in awe, and to preſerve even wicked Men from running to all exceſs of Riot and Iniquity, by preſſing the Commands of God always upon their Conſciences, and by ſetting before them the Vengeance and Curſes of the Law of God, which are due to Sinners, to preſerve the World from univerſal Diſorder and Wickedneſs. If there were no ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of the Holineſs and Juſtice of God in the World, what ſhameful Impieties againſt God, and moſt outragious Iniquities and Villanies would be ſpread among the Children of Men: So that there would be no ſuch thing as Peace, and Civility and Honeſty to be found in ſeveral Places. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, 1 Tim. i. 9, 10. <hi>Knowing this, that the Law is not made
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:006440_0119_1028DADADCB90700"/>
for a righteous Man, but for the Lawleſs and Diſobedient, for the Ungodly and for Sinners, for Unholy and Prophane, for Murderers of Fathers and Murderers of Mothers, for Manſlayers, for Whoremongers, for them that defile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Mankind, for Menſtealers, for Liars, for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured Perſons, and if there be any other thing that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to ſound Doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The holy Apoſtle acknowledges, where the Law of God is originally written in the Heart, and a Man is made righteous by a thorough Sanctification of all the Powers of Nature as it is in Heaven, there is no ſuch need of the Commands, Threatnings, and Terrors of a penal Law, to keep Men in the practice of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; their own innocent or renewed Nature, their ſincere and univerſal Love to God, and to his Law, will powerfully incline them to the Practice of Holineſs, without the Terrors and Puniſhments from the Hand of the bleſſed God, being always kept before their Eyes.</p>
               <p>It is true, there are ſome Caſes wherein the Law of God may not be well known, even to good Men, or may be miſtaken by them, and there may be need of ſpecial Commands to diſcover what is our Duty, and what is Sin: But where the Law is well known, the inward Power of univerſal Goodneſs in the Soul, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe outward Terrors, is made effectual to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Holineſs and Obedience in the Life.</p>
               <p>But perhaps you will then reply, <hi>Where there are true Chriſtians found, of what Uſe is it for them to keep the Law of God?</hi> This is the <hi>ſecond Enquiry,</hi> and to this I would give ſeveral particular <hi>Anſwers,</hi> beſides the firſt and general one. In general I ſay then, it muſt be acknowledged, that there are ſo many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of indwelling Sin in the beſt of Men, that Fears and Terrors of the Puniſhments of God, have their Uſe in this imperfect State, to prevent the Soul from
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:006440_0120_1028F040F7552558"/>
warping aſide to ſinful Practices, under ſtrong and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Temptations. Such frail and imperfect Creatures are we in this preſent State.</p>
               <p>I proceed now to give ſome particular <hi>Anſwers</hi> to this <hi>Queſtion, Of what Uſe is it to keep the Law?</hi> and they are ſuch as theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1<hi>ſt.</hi> Though we are not ſaved from the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of Hell, nor pardoned and accepted to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life and Happineſs in Heaven, by virtue of our poor imperfect Obedience, and keeping the Commands of the moral Law, <hi>yet we can never be ſaved without it</hi>: For our Love to the Law of God and a hearty Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to keep it, is a great Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> of the very Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the Goſpel provides for ſinful Men. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the Son of God is become our Saviour, not only <hi>to ſave us from God's Wrath,</hi> 1 Theſ. i. 10. but alſo to <hi>ſave us from our Sins.</hi> Matt. i. 21. and Tit. ii. 14. <hi>He gave himſelf for us that he might redeem us from all Iniquity, and purify to himſelf a peculiar People zealous of good Works.</hi> We muſt be reſtored to the Image of God as well as to his Favour; now his Image is all Holineſs.</p>
               <p>Mankind by the Fall have not only loſt their Original State of Innocency and Happineſs, but their natural Powers are corrupted, the Mind, Will and Paſſions are perverted, and defiled, and turned away from God, and from their Duty to his Law. Now 'tis one great Deſign of the Goſpel to rectify theſe Diſorders in the Nature of Man: 'Tis one of the Promiſes of the Goſpel that <hi>the Law of God ſhall be written in our Hearts,</hi> Heb. x. 16. and one of the great Offices and Buſineſſes of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as a Saviour, is by all the Methods of his Grace and Power, to reduce our Hearts to the Love of God and his Law: <hi>He is made Sanctification to us</hi> as well as <hi>Redemption,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 30. So that for Men to talk of being ſaved without Love and Obedience to
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:006440_0121_1028F0436644D060"/>
the moral Law of God, is to talk plain Inconſiſtencies, or to affirm what natural Reaſon can never allow, and what Scripture and the Goſpel never deſigned; in ſhort, 'tis to talk of being ſaved without Salvation.</p>
               <p>The moral Law of God is of Eternal Obligation upon Creatures: And it would be our conſtant Duty to obey it, even if we could ſuppoſe there were no ſuch future State, no ſuch Eternal Life provided for Men as the Goſpel reveals. It ariſes from the Relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and his Creatures. We can never be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingaged or releaſed from this Duty by the Goſpel, which brings in Pardon and Mercy to ſave us from the Puniſhment due <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o our Defects or Tranſgreſſions of the Law; but not to releaſe us from Obedience to it.</p>
               <p>A holy God will not ſave Sinners from Hell, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them their Sins, without making them holy. <hi>Chriſt</hi> in all his abounding Love to Sinners, will not become <hi>a Miniſter of Sin,</hi> Gal. ii. 17, 19, 20. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of God in his Grace to Sinners, by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is that <hi>they might be holy and without Blame before him in Love,</hi> Eph. i. 4. And hereby we ſhew that the Grace of God, in the Forgiveneſs of Sin, is not loſt upon us, but obtains the End for which it was deſign'd, (<hi>viz.</hi>) to bring us back to God and Holineſs.</p>

Good Works are recommended by St. <hi>Paul</hi> for this Purpoſe, Tit. iii. 8. <hi>This is a faithful Saying, and I will that thou conſtantly affirm, that they who have believed in God might be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to maintain good Works. Theſe things are good and profitable to Men.</hi> 'Tis neceſſary to convince the World that our Goſpel is all holy, and that it indulges and allows of no known Sin: That this Goſpel is a divine Bleſſing to Mankind, that it carries Bleſſings with it whereſoever it comes, that it cures the Vices of the Mind, and the ſinful Paſſions of the Heart, that it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes all Injuſtice and Cruelty, Fraud and Malice, Envy and Oppreſſion, and every evil Work which Sin and <hi>Satan</hi> have introduced into this World. A Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian muſt preach and prove the Purity and Power of his Goſpel in his whole Converſation, that it changes a Lion into a Lamb, an Earth-Worm into an Angel, and a Son of <hi>Adam</hi> into a Child of God. This is the Way to <hi>adorn the Doctrine of God our Saviour,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſes it, <hi>Tit.</hi> ii. 10.

<pb n="110" facs="unknown:006440_0125_1028F04D406A3768"/>
indeed this is one chief Deſign of God's appointing ſuch a ſolemn and publick Tranſaction as the laſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that all the Creation may ſee the Equity or Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the Dealings of God with Men, that he awards the eternal Recompenſe to Saints and Sinners, according to their different Characters of Vice and Virtue, Sin and Holineſs. <hi>The Veſſels of Wrath</hi> are by their own Rebellion and Impenitence <hi>fitted to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi> and <hi>the Veſſels of Mercy</hi> are by ſanctifying Grace and Holineſs <hi>before prepar'd unto Glory,</hi> Rom. ix. 22, 23.</p>
               <p>Though our own Works are by no means ſufficient to atone for Sin, or to procure the Favour of God or Eternal Life, for ſuch guilty Creatures as we are, yet there is (as Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> I think in his Book of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, calls it) a <hi>rewardable Condecency</hi> in the Works of Holineſs, and there is many a Promiſe of heavenly Rewards made to them in the New Teſtament: Now when <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall adjudge the Wicked to Hell, and the Saints to Heaven, the whole Creation muſt approve the Equity of his Dealings with Men. In the mean time the Saints ſhall admire the Grace of God, and the Mediation of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> while they ſee how unworthy they and their Works are of ſuch a glorious Reward.</p>
               <p>Thus we find there is abundant Reaſon for our Obedience to the Commands of the moral Law tho' it is not made the proper Condition, or preſcribed Term of our Acceptance with God, and of obtaining Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs by the Goſpel; for 'tis only perfect Obedience to theſe Commands in Thought, Word and Deed, can give us a Right to Eternal Life, according to the Law. And yet a ſincere Endeavour after univerſal Obedience to them, is one neceſſary Requiſite of our being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by <hi>Chriſt</hi> at laſt, and our actual Entrance into Heaven, according to the Goſpel: Hereupon I am bold to affirm, that thoſe Perſons whom all theſe Reaſons
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:006440_0126_1028F050D7D48278"/>
cannot draw to the ſincere Practice of Holineſs, may be ſure they never believed in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and are not Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Salvation of the Goſpel; for the great and neceſſary Duty of Chriſtianity is <hi>Faith which works by Love,</hi> Gal. v. 6. <hi>The Heart is purify'd by true Faith,</hi> Acts xv. 9.

Reflection. <hi>It is a dangerous thing to miſtake the great Deſign of Chriſt's Miniſtry here on Earth.</hi> Let us learn from this Diſcourſe, that our Saviour often preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Sinners the Goſpel of Grace and Forgiveneſs, of Repentance and Faith in himſelf; yet that his chief Buſineſs here, was not to preach the Goſpel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, nor to preach it in its full Light, Perfection and Glory; but rather to prepare the Way for it when he had laid the Foundation in his own Death and Reſurrection, and when his Kingdom ſhould be ſet up in the World in his Apoſtles, and by his Spirit, and built upon this Foundation. He prepared the Way for his Spirit, and his Apoſtles, even as <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> prepared the Way for him.</p>
                  <p>The great Buſineſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in this Life on Earth, was to appear with the Characters of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> on him; to anſwer the Types and Propheſies that went before concerning him; to paſs through the Stages of Life without Sin as our Example; to yield a perfect Obedience to the Law, and fulfil all thoſe Precepts in Perfection which we could never fulfil; to preach the Law in the Spirituality and Perfection of its Demands, and begin to open the Goſpel; to reſign and ſubmit himſelf to Death, as a Sacrifice for Sin, accurſed by
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:006440_0127_1028F054176FB1E0"/>
the Law, and devoted to the puniſhing Juſtice of God: And hereby he laid a Foundation for clearer preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel of Forgiveneſs of Sins through his Blood, which Doctrine he juſt mentions to his Diſciples at the laſt Supper.</p>
                  <p>As for his own publick Preaching, it chiefly conſiſted in clear and full Explications of the Law of God in its Spirituality, which had been ſhamefully obſcured and curtailed by the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors; in bringing the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Worlds of Heaven and Hell into a nearer and brighter View; in vindicating his own Conduct againſt the Accuſations of Men; in maintaining his own Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, as one ſent of God; in reproving the <hi>Jews</hi> for their corrupt Traditions, for their Hypocriſy, for their Self-Righteouſneſs, for their Uncharitableneſs to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and thus calling the World to Conviction of Sin and Repentance, and preparing the Way by his Parables for the Reception of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> into the Church. When he preached the Goſpel of his Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Sin and Faith in his Blood, it was rather in ſecret to his Diſciples; or if in publick, 'twas gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in dark Sayings and Parables, and myſtical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, ſuch as, <hi>The Son of Man being lifted up</hi> and <hi>drawing all Men to him, giving his Fleſh for Meat to the People, and his Blood for Drink,</hi> &amp;c. The plaineſt Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which (I think) <hi>Chriſt</hi> ever gave of the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sinners by his own Death as a Sacrifice, to People who were not his Diſciples, was in thoſe meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical Words two or three times repeated in the Tenth Chapter of <hi>John, I am the good Shepherd, who giveth his Life for the Sheep.</hi> But when his Death and Reſurrection had laid a fairer Foundation for the Goſpel, then he taught it his Diſciples much more plainly after his Reſurrection, both by his Converſation and by his Spirit, and ſent them to publiſh it to the whole World more gloriouſly than ever he himſelf
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:006440_0128_1028F055A12F7BC0"/>
taught it to the <hi>Jews.</hi> See this explain'd more at large in Dr. <hi>Watts</hi>'s ſecond Sermon on <hi>the Atonement of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, I ſay, a Miſtake in the Deſign of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Preaching, may lead many People into ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Miſ-apprehenſions about ſeveral Things, and particularly about the Way of Salvation by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When we hear <hi>Chriſt</hi> preach the Law ſo much, and ſpeak of <hi>entering into Life by keeping the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> if we imagine all this to be the clear Goſpel, <hi>we ſhall ſeek to be ſaved as it were by the Works of the Law,</hi> which the Apoſtle ſo ſeverely reproves the <hi>Galatians</hi> for, and the <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Jewiſh Chriſtians,</hi> who dwelt among the <hi>Romans. Rom.</hi> ix. 31, 32. <hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 1, &amp;c. and iv. 21. and v. 4. And if our Opinions and Conduct be the ſame, we ſhall expoſe ourſelves to the ſame ſacred Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof of the Apoſtle, and be greatly bewildered in the Way to Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Such a Miſtake in the Deſign of Chriſt's preaching the Law,</hi> as though he taught it as the Way for the Salvation of Sinners, <hi>will incline us to expound the Law in ſo groſs and defective a Senſe, as the Phariſees did of old, that ſo expounded, Sinners may be able to keep it, and obey the Commands of it ſufficient to gain Salvation thereby.</hi> It will tempt us to retrench and diminiſh the Perfection of its Demands of univerſal Holineſs in Thought, Word and Deed; becauſe otherwiſe we cannot yield a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Obedience. Whereas it is much more glorious to God, the Governor of the World, to ſuppoſe his holy Law ſtill maintains its own perfect Purity, and its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Demands of conſtant univerſal Obedience; and 'tis more glorious to God our Saviour, to ſuppoſe that he has provided an effectual Way for the Salvation of ſinful Creatures, who truſt in divine Mercy, and who
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:006440_0129_1028F05837350E80"/>
love the Law of God, though their beſt Obedience to it be very defective.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Such a Miſtake will lead Miniſters to neglect the mention of the Death and Sufferings of Chriſt as a Sacrifice for Sin, and as the Foundation of our Pardon and our Hope;</hi> it will lead them to omit theſe important Points in their Deſcriptions of the Goſpel, and in their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of Faith in <hi>Chriſt</hi>; becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> never ſpoke ſo publickly and plainly to the People, of making Atonement for Sin by his Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And upon this Account we ſhall be in danger of leaving this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine out of our Directions of Sinners when they ſeek the Way to Salvation, which is now made plainer and more neceſſary ſince the Death and Reſurrection of <hi>Chriſt</hi> are accompliſhed, ſince the Apoſtles have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly explain'd this Doctrine, and the New Teſtament is compleat.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>This Miſtake will tempt us to ſet</hi> Chriſt <hi>and his Apoſtles at variance about the Way of Salvation. Chriſt</hi> ſays, <hi>If thou wilt enter into Life, keep the Commandments</hi>; and the Apoſtles ſay, <hi>The Law is the Miniſtration of Death,</hi> but <hi>believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved</hi>; and <hi>we are juſtified by Faith without the Works of the Law,</hi> &amp;c. And thus we ſhall make the Holy Scripture contradict itſelf: Or if we endeavour to accommodate and reconcile theſe ſeeming Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, upon a Suppoſition that <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Language of my Text preached the Goſpel, it can never be done, with Fairneſs and Juſtneſs of Thought, without ſtraining the Words of Scripture from their natural Senſe; and it will ever bring a Darkneſs upon the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction between the Law and Goſpel, and leave the Way of Salvation by the Goſpel under much Confuſion.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>This will tempt and incline us to expound the clear Goſpel, which we find in the Writings and Preaching of St. Paul,</hi> St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and St. <hi>John,</hi> after the Death and
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:006440_0130_1028F05ADB2B46C8"/>
Reſurrection of <hi>Chriſt, by one of the legal Expreſſions of our Saviour,</hi> when in his own Life-time he preach'd the Law for the Conviction of Sinners: We ſhall interpret the Words and Language of the Goſpel into the Senſe of the Law of Works: We ſhall almoſt explain away the Covenant of Grace, and make a Covenant of Works of it: And thus, perhaps, expoſe ourſelves to the Danger of St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Cenſure and <hi>Anathema,</hi> by <hi>preaching another Goſpel,</hi> or <hi>perverting the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> Gal. i. 8.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>This Miſtake will lead us to ſlight and deſpiſe the Writings of the Apoſtles, as though they never did nor could preach the Goſpel ſo clearly as Chriſt himſelf</hi>; whereas they were really deſign'd and ſent forth after the Death and Reſurrection and Aſcenſion of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to preach the full Goſpel to the Nations in clearer and ſtronger Language than <hi>Jeſus</hi> himſelf ever did to the Multitude; they were inſtructed and commiſſioned to publiſh the Way to Salvation by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in a brighter and more explicite Manner and Expreſſion, than his Divine Wiſdom thought proper to do before he had actually died and roſe again, by which Tranſactions he laid the Foundation for preaching the Goſpel more clearly and perfectly.</p>
                  <p>A Miſtake about the perſonal Miniſtry of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in ſuch Paſſages as this in my Text, will make us look upon the glorious and evangelical Paragraphs in the Sermons and the Epiſtles of <hi>Peter, Paul</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> as mere affectionate and fervent Pieces of Diſcourſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the warm Temper and lively Fancies of thoſe honeſt and zealous Men, who in the Heat of their Spirits ſpoke many Things myſtically and unintelligibly. This hath been the profeſs'd Opinion of ſome who are called <hi>Chriſtians</hi> concerning the great Apoſtle; and upon this Account they think none of his Writings are to be read without great Caution: But if you will
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:006440_0131_1028F05E106C5498"/>
ſeek the Way of Salvation aright (ſay they) you muſt go to the Mount, and hear our Saviour's Sermon there, in the v. vi. and vii. Chapters of the Goſpel of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> while they neglect the more evangelical Speeches even of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf. This has been the Language of ſome Men, the Leaders of the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the ignorant Multitude, who are by Nature inclined enough to a Covenant of Works, and need not be taught and perſuaded to build all their Hopes of Heaven upon the Works of the Law, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> never deſigned in that noble and admirable Sermon of his on the Mountain.</p>
                  <p>But now if we ſuppoſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> frequently preaching the Law, on purpoſe to ſhew the <hi>Jews</hi> the groſſeſt Defects and Imperfection of their Obedience, and their Need of a Saviour, and giving ſuch Hints of the Goſpel as were ſuited to that Diſpenſation of his Life and perſonal Miniſtry; and if we ſuppoſe the Apoſtles more fully preaching this Goſpel (which our Saviour juſt opened and begun in his Lifetime) and publiſhing it in all its Glory of Righteouſneſs and Grace, after the Death and Reſerrection of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe it was not proper to be thus clearly preached before, then we may well reconcile the different Language of St. <hi>Paul</hi> and of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when one ſaith, <hi>Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> and the other, <hi>If thou wilt enter into Life keep the ten Commandments.</hi> 'Tis certain that the <hi>Law is not againſt the Promiſes,</hi> Gal. iii. 21. but the <hi>Law is our Schoolmaſter,</hi> and Leader of us as Children to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> ſo the <hi>Greek</hi> Word <hi>Paidagogos</hi> means, <hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 24. Conviction of Sin by <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Law, leads Men, as in a lower School, as yet, to proceed farther, and to ſeek for and embrace the Grace of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Goſpel, as 'tis preached more fully and clearly by his Apoſtles under the Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his Spirit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="117" facs="unknown:006440_0132_1028F05F99314B88"/>This Scheme and View of Things being well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted in the Mind, will help us to underſtand many of thoſe legal Expreſſions in the New Teſtament, which might ſeem to lead us to the Covenant of Works again, or which ſeem to mingle the Law and Goſpel for Salvation, if we will but remember that the Holy Ghoſt in the New Teſtament ſometimes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers the <hi>Law</hi> in its Severity and Perfection of Demands for the Conviction of Sin, as well as for the Diſcovery of our Duty, and ſometimes reveals the <hi>Goſpel</hi> in the Riches of its Grace, for the Faith and Salvation of awakened Sinners.</p>

                     <hi>How firm and durable is the ancient and perfect Law of God, which requires perfect, conſtant and perſevering Obedience?</hi> It is an eternal Law: It is not yet aboliſhed, though the Goſpel be introduc'd, nor ſhall it be through all the Ages of Mankind, and the ſeveral Diſpenſations of God toward Men. The moral Law is ſometimes ſaid to be a Tranſcript or Copy from the Nature and Attributes of God; the Duties there required bear the more perfect Stamp and Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature of his eſſential Perfections, and therefore the Law muſt be unchangeable.</p>
                  <p>And not only the Requirements of Duty, but I think the Sanctions of the Law alſo in its promiſed Rewards and threatned Penalties are everlaſting. <hi>He that doth theſe</hi> Commands perfectly <hi>ſhall live in, or by them:</hi> But <hi>Curſed is he that continueth not in all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Law to do them,</hi> and he muſt die, <hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 10, 12. I do not find any Scripture that tells me, that the Commands, or the Sanctions are repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

                        <p>If it ſhould be ſaid, that the Apoſtle in <hi>Heb.</hi> vii. 18. ſays, <hi>There is verily a diſannulling of the Commandments for the Weakneſs and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitableneſs thereof, for the Law made nothing perfect,</hi> &amp;c. I anſwer, that the Context plainly ſhews that the Words <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Commandment</hi> here, do not mean the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> but refer either to the <hi>Sinai</hi> Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or the whole Scheme of the <hi>Jewiſh Oeconomy,</hi> and particularly to the <hi>Levitical Prieſthood</hi> which is abrogated, becauſe it could not make a proper Atonement for Sin.</p>
                        <p>If it ſhould be objected yet again, that the ſame Apoſtle in <hi>Rom.</hi> vii. 6. declares, that <hi>we are now delivered from the Law, that being dead in which we were held</hi>; and that the <hi>Law</hi> in this Place means the <hi>Ten Commandments,</hi> becauſe the Apoſtle argues from the Tenth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>Thou ſhalt not Covet:</hi> I anſwer, that the Apoſtle there plainly means, that <hi>now</hi> under the Goſpel we who are true Chriſtians, and are entered into the Covenant of Grace by Faith, <hi>are deliver'd from</hi> the Bondage and Chains of <hi>the Law</hi> as a Covenant of Works, whereby our indwelling Sins were rather irritated and provoked than ſubdued: <hi>It is dead, i. e.</hi> it has loſt its unhappy Influences on true Believers: But not that the Law itſelf is aboliſhed, either as a Rule of Life to Chriſtians, or as a condemning Covenant of Works to thoſe who are not entered into the New Covenant or a State of Grace, by Faith and Repentance: For he adds, <hi>v.</hi> 12. that even now <hi>the Law is holy, and the Commandment holy, and juſt, and good.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If this might be explained by a Similitude, I think 'tis much in the ſame manner as the <hi>Penal Laws againſt the Proteſtant Diſſenters</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> are not aboliſh'd, but ſtand in Force ſtill: Yet they have no Power to hurt any Perſon who accepts of the <hi>Act of Toleration,</hi> and qualifies himſelf accordingly: Tho' indeed there is this Difference, that it can never be ſaid, that thoſe Penal Laws are now, or ever were either <hi>Holy, Juſt</hi> or <hi>Good,</hi> as the Law of God is.</p>
                     </note> though God hath provided a Way to deliver Men who receive the Goſpel and enter into God's new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant from the Bondage of the Law as a Covenant of Works, and to releaſe and free repenting Sinners from this curſed Death, to deliver them from this Sentence of Condemnation, and to beſtow on them the Bleſſings of Eternal Life.</p>
                  <p>It is granted indeed, as the Apoſtle confeſſes, <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 3. That <hi>through the</hi> Weakneſs <hi>of our Fleſh the Law is become weak</hi> and unable to ſave Sinners; becauſe their
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:006440_0134_1028F06597885290"/>
corrupt Nature and fleſhly Inclinations render them unable to keep it perfectly; but, as I intimated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it is not weak in its own Nature to give Life. <hi>Chriſt</hi> in my Text preaches the Law, and ſays, <hi>If thou keep the Commandments. (i. e.</hi> with a perſevering Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, and a ſinleſs Perfection) <hi>thou ſhalt enter into Life:</hi> What <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpeaks is true. If any Man appear who hath been guilty of no Sin, and hath fulfilled the Law of God in every tittle of it in Thought, Word and Deed, he ſhall have eternal Happineſs. Rom. ii. 7. <hi>They who ſeek for Glory, Honour and Immortality, by patient continuance in well doing (en ergo agatho,</hi> in one good Work, without intermiſſion or interruption by any Sin) <hi>they ſhall have Eternal Life.</hi> This is the Language of the Law of Works. But our Incapacity to fulfil this Law in our fallen State, hath awaken'd the Compaſſion of God to provide a Goſpel of Grace and Pardon, and to ſend his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> down from Heaven to Earth for this very Purpoſe, that humble, repenting, returning Sinners, who truſt in the Mercy of God through a Mediator, might be ſaved, even while they cannot fulfil the perfect Demands of his pure and holy Law, though they ſincerely endeavour it.</p>
                  <p>The Great and Bleſſed God maintains his holy Law ſtill in its own Perfection and Glory, though we have loſt our practical or moral Power of obeying it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly: I ſay, we have loſt, by our Fall in <hi>Adam,</hi> our moral or practical Power of perfect Obedience to the Law; but our natural Powers of Underſtanding, Will and Affections remain, and there is no other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Power or Faculty required, in order to obey it. And ſince our natural Powers remain, the Great God requires perfect Obedience of us, and all Men, to his holy Law, and yet he aſſures us by his Goſpel, that he will not inflict the Curſe of the Law on thoſe who heartily repent of their Sins, and truſt in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> though
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:006440_0135_1028F0672664CFC8"/>
they do not or cannot yield perfect Obedience to this Law.</p>
                  <p>He doth not leſſen or diminiſh the Demands of his Law, which requires <hi>Perfection</hi> ſtill; for his Nature is too pure to require only an <hi>imperfect</hi> Obedience. If God under the Goſpel, had quite laid aſide, or abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed his Law, and required or commanded no more than ſuch a ſincere imperfect Obedience, or ſuch good Works which converted and pious Men perform, then they would fulfil the Requirements or Commands of God, and would have no Sin, and ſuch Perſons would need no Pardon. But this is contrary to the whole Tenor of the New Teſtament. <hi>If we ſay we have no Sin, we make God a Liar, we deceive ourſelves, and the Truth is not in us,</hi> 1 John i. 10. The Law of God is Eternal, and demands perfect Obedience of every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: But his Grace pardons thoſe who cannot come up to the perfect Demands of this Law, by reaſon of the moral Impotence contracted by the Fall, if they apply themſelves to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> his Son, according to the Rules of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>The Law therefore is Holy, and <hi>Juſt,</hi> and Good, and will be ſo to all Generations, <hi>Rom.</hi> vii. 12. and when our Saviour was beginning his divine and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Expoſition of it on the Mount, he warns us in Matt. v. 17, 18. <hi>Think not I am come to deſtroy the Law and the Prophets: I am not come to deſtroy but to fulfil: for verily I ſay unto you, till Heaven and Earth paſs, one jot or one tittle ſhall in no wiſe paſs from the Law till all be fulfilled</hi>; and our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> has put Honour upon his Father's Law ſeveral ways.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He preached and explained it in the glorious Purity and Perfection of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He fulfilled it all himſelf in moſt exact Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and thereby ſet all his Followers an admirable Example how to fulfil it.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="121" facs="unknown:006440_0136_1028F0699AFDFD08"/>3. He ſuffered Death for the Diſhonour we had caſt upon it by our Sins, not to deſtroy the Sanction of it, but to free us from the Curſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He hath taken all the Rules or Commandments of it into the Scheme of his Goſpel, as divine Rules and Directions for the conſtant Practice of Believers, and obliges them to obey it with their utmoſt Care and Endeavour, though he hath taken away from them that Curſe and Condemnation, which originally belongs to every degree of Diſobedience.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He ſends his own Holy Spirit continually to write this Law in the Hearts of his People, and to form and mould their Souls to a delightful Conformity to the Rules of it.</p>
                  <p>Thus it appears, that <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> himſelf and the very Scheme of the Goſpel doth confirm and not aboliſh the Law. <hi>Rom.</hi> iii. 31. The Law is everlaſting, and the Goſpel doth not deſtroy it, while yet it relieves guilty Creatures from the deſerved Penalties.</p>

                  <p>That Divine Teacher explain'd the Law clearly, and ſet the Commands of it in their full Light and Beauty, partly to lead us to a more ſpiritual Practice man the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors of the Law were acquainted with, and partly to ſhew our utter Incapacity of keeping the Law, or obtaining Eternal Life by it: He alſo began to publiſh the Goſpel of Grace, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Forgiveneſs; but (as was declared before) his ſovereign Wiſdom did not think proper publickly to explain and illuſtrate this Goſpel of Forgiveneſs with the Doctrine of his own Sacrifice, his Death, his Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for our Sins, his Reſurrection for our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his Interceſſion for us in Heaven, and his ruling the World for the Good of his People: He left all this to be done by his Apoſtles, when the Spirit ſhould come down upon them and teach them many things which they could not bear in his Life-time, and which therefore he did not clearly teach them. <hi>John</hi> xvi. 12.</p>

                     <pb n="124" facs="unknown:006440_0139_1028F0730BC14AE8"/>Value therefore and love the Goſpel, and return not to the Law of Works, as the Means or Rule of your Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, Gal. iv. 21. <hi>Tell me ye that deſire to be under the Law, do ye not hear the Law,</hi> how it curſes every Sinner, and condemns them all without Remedy and without Hope? 'Tis the Buſineſs of Sinners to fly to and live upon this Goſpel of Forgiveneſs, and not ſeek to eſtabliſh their own imperfect Righteouſneſs before God. Rejoice in the Way of Juſtification by the Obedience, Death and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Son of God in Fleſh. Never hope to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Pardon of Sin, and to ſecure the Salvation which <hi>Chriſt</hi> has revealed, by your own keeping the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Law, for your beſt Righteouſneſſes are all very defective and inſufficient: But repent of Sin, truſt in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and live upon atoning Blood and pardoning Grace, while you humbly ſeek after the higheſt Degrees of Holineſs and Conformity to the Commands of the Law. By this means you ſhall <hi>magnify the Law of God, and make it honourable</hi> in the Sight of Men, even while your Hope of Salvation and Eternal Life is entirely owing to the rich Grace of God in the Goſpel of his Son <hi>Jeſus</hi>: To him that has loved us, and waſhed us from our Sins in his Blood, to him that has redeemed us from the Curſe of the Law, by being made a Curſe and a Sacrifice for us, be Glory, Honour and Dominon for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>

            <p>IF the Race of Man were immortal on Earth, and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were never ſummon'd to die, or if they could put an eternal End to their Souls when the Body lies down in the Duſt, there would be little Concern among us, <hi>How ſhall I come and appear before God?</hi> or <hi>What ſhall I do to obtain his Favour?</hi> Sinful Creatures ſeem to live well enough among the Cares or Amuſements of this Life, though they are <hi>without God in the World</hi>; and if they could live for ever without ſeeing him, or could plunge into Death and the unſeen World, and not meet him there, they would take no Thought about that grand Enquiry, which <hi>Balak</hi> the King of <hi>Moab</hi> thought to be of ſuch Importance, <hi>Wherewith ſhall I come before the Lord, or how my ſelf before the high God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when the Conſciences of Men begin to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that they are Tranſgreſſors againſt the Law of their Maker, and that they muſt one Day appear before him, as their Governor and their Judge, and anſwer for their Conduct, then they inquire in good earneſt, <hi>What they ſhall do to ſtand in his Sight with Acceptance,</hi> or <hi>to draw near his Majeſty without Terror?</hi> Then Reaſon and Nature exert all their Forces to find an Anſwer to this grand Queſtion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="126" facs="unknown:006440_0141_1028F07762DDDB88"/>But Nature and Reaſon darkened and weakened by the Fall of Man, and unaſſiſted by Revelation and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace, lead them into many miſtaken Ways, ſuch as will never bring them into the Favour of him who made them, nor obtain true Happineſs. Poor fooliſh and fallen Mankind is ready to try many means of procuring Eternal Life for themſelves, before they will betake themſelves to the one only Way which God has appointed by his Goſpel, and that is, <hi>Faith in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the ſeveral <hi>miſtaken Ways</hi> that Sinners are ready to chuſe in this Caſe, theſe three are the chief, (<hi>viz.</hi>) The Way of <hi>ſuppoſed Innocency,</hi> The Way <hi>of Dependance on God's general Goodneſs,</hi> and the Way of their own <hi>Repentence</hi> and <hi>Self-Righteouſneſs.</hi> Let us conſider each of theſe, and enquire into the Juſtneſs of their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>The Way of Innocency.</hi> How many Souls are there in ſuch a Land as this, who come to God with a thoughtleſs Confidence, and expect to find Mercy at his Hands, though they are conſcious they have not done ſo much Good as they ought, nor have been ſo religious as they ſhould be? yet they think they are harmleſs and have done no Wrong, and therefore they are ſafe for Eternity. Perhaps, by Education and other Methods of reſtraining Grace, they have eſcaped the viler Pollutions of the Age, and been preſerved from groſs Impieties: Then they hope and believe all ſhall go well with them, and dream of nothing but the Favour of God, and Happineſs after Death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Life has been outwardly unblameable in the World. Thus they live, and thus they die.</p>
            <p>Ask theſe Perſons when they lie languiſhing on a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pillow, <q>How they can venture to appear before the great the juſt and the holy God, in the World of Spirits?</q> They will readily return this Anſwer,
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:006440_0142_1028F07B058DEFA0"/>
They have done no Harm, and they hope God will do them none; they have wronged no Man, and they know not why they ſhould not be accepted of God. Poor ignorant, unthinking Creatures! One would wonder that ſo groſs Blindneſs and Stupidity ſhould remain on the Minds of any who ſit under the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Law and Goſpel. Let me endeavour to convince ſuch Sinners here, and prove that this Hope is a falſe and dangerous one.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If it were poſſible that they ſhould be found ſuch as they ſuppoſe themſelves, that is, innocent in their <hi>outward Carriages and Actions</hi> toward their fellow Creatures, yet have their <hi>Language</hi> and their <hi>Lips</hi> been always innocent too? Or if they have in the main learnt to bridle their Tongues from groſs Falſehood, and Wrath, and Slander, yet have they never indulged evil Imaginations againſt their Neighbour, and the working of evil Paſſions? Sirs, if we conſtrue the Law of Duty to extend to our Hearts, as well as to our Lips and our Lives, as our Saviour has conſtrued it in his Sermon on the Mount, <hi>Matt.</hi> v. and vi. and vii. who is there can ever plead Innocence?</p>
            <p>You have kept your Actions to all Appearance tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably blameleſs, with regard to Men, but have you never broken the laſt Command of the ſecond Table, never deſirous or covetous of another's Poſſeſſions in Thought, never been guilty of Immorality's in Heart? Can ſuch Souls plead at the Bar of God, that they never allow'd one envious Thought againſt their Neighbour, and never let looſe a malicious Word? That they never coveted that which belong'd to another, nor wilfully leſſened their Neighbour's good Name or Reputation? Did they never find Wrath or Revenge kindling and burning within them without Reſiſtance? Did they never indulge the Motions of Luſt or Intemperance, or any ſinful Deſire ſtirring in their Hearts? When the
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:006440_0143_1028F07DD43CCD28"/>
great Apoſtle, in the ſecond and third Chapters to the <hi>Romans,</hi> is convincing all the World of Sin, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mankind under a Senſe of Guilt, he convinces them effectually by their Breach of the ſecond Table, <hi>that all have ſinned and come ſhort of the Glory of God.</hi> Rom. ii. 21. and iii. 10, 12 — 14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where's the Son or Daughter of <hi>Adam</hi> that can ſtand forth and ſay, I never diſhonoured Father or Mother, nor ever diſobey'd the juſt Commands of my Superiors; I never was unreaſonably angry againſt another; I never encouraged a wanton Thought within me, nor indulged any covetous and ſinful Wiſh; I never broke the Rule of Temperance in eating and drinking, nor ever gave way to an irregular Paſſion. I never was guilty of known Falſhood in Deſign or in Word. Let Mankind take but theſe Laws of God, which regard themſelves and their Neighbours, and make a ſincere Examination of themſelves thereby, and their own Conſciences will ſoon condemn the very beſt of them in the Sight of God. They are all condemn'd by the Law of Innocence, and if they have no better Plea, they will meet with an offended and angry God, in whoſe Sight no Sinner can ſtand and find Acceptance. His Law is wiſe and righteous, and every Violation of it deſerves a Proportion of Puniſhment.</p>
            <p>Perhaps they will plead after ſuch a ſtrict Enquiry, that though they have not been perfectly innocent, yet their Offences have not been groſs and conſtant; but only of the ſmaller kind and few in Number, and therefore they hope for Excuſe: But the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> takes away this Hope alſo, when he tells us, <hi>James</hi> ii. 8, 10. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall keep the whole Law and yet offend in one Point, he is guilty of all,</hi> for by one wilful Sin he abuſes that Governor and affronts that Authority by which all the Commands are enjoin'd. Nor is any wilful Sin ſmall in the Sight of Divine Juſtice, for
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:006440_0144_1028F07F5EF5CFD0"/>
it is the Fruit of a preſumptuous Heart, and is therefore highly criminal.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe after their own Review of their Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, they ſhould pronounce themſelves quite innocent, and ſay boldly, <hi>They knew nothing by themſelves</hi>; yet they are not ſufficiently juſtified hereby, for God ſees the Heart, and he knows us better than we know our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vii. 2. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> iv. 4. <hi>Receive us,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, we have wronged no Man, we have corrupted no Man, we have defrauded no Man; for though I know nothing by my ſelf,</hi> i. e. nothing of Fraud or Deceit, on wilful Injury, <hi>yet am I not hereby juſtified, but he that judgeth me is the Lord.</hi> The Eyes of God are a Flame of Fire, and will find Iniquity where I can find none, for he ſees all the Diſguiſes and Veils of Self-Love and Self-Flattery, whereby every Man is naturally prone to cover his Sins, and to impoſe upon himſelf. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds thoſe ſecret Ferments, thoſe hidden Operations and Motions of Sin in the Soul, which paſs by unno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed to ourſelves, and eſcape the Ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uſation and Charge of our Conſciences. He knows ſo perfectly all the juſt Demands of his own Law, in the Lengths and the Breadths thereof, and is ſo perfectly acquainted with all the Motions of our Hearts, all their Follies and Paſſions, and ſinful Byaſſes, that he can find in us a thouſand Contrarieties to his Law, where we are fondly ready to preſume upon our own Innocence. Should I ſay with <hi>Joh,</hi> Chap. ix. ver. 30. <hi>If I ſhould waſh myſelf in Snow-Water, and make my Hands never ſo clean, thou wilt plunge me in the Ditch, and my own Clothes would abhor me.</hi> i. e. If I ſhould uſe all my own Purifications, thou wilt diſcover me to be ſtill as greatly defiled with Sin, as one who is plunged into a Ditch, and is unfit to put on his common Raiment, leſt he defile that and every thing about him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="130" facs="unknown:006440_0145_1028F081F2A560B8"/>Alas, how little do Men believe this? How little do they know and think of their own Guilt in the Sight of God, and the Depth of their own Miſery! How are they led by their own Thoughtleſneſs and ſhameful Ignorance of themſelves to build their Hopes for Eternity on a very ſandy Foundation, which will never ſtand in the Day of that Divine Tempeſt, which ſhall try every Man's Work?</p>
            <p>You imagine, God will not be ſo ſtrict a Judge, and ſo ſevere, as Preachers repreſent him; but how do you know that he will not be thus ſevere in his Enquiries and his Judgment? I'm well aſſured the mere Light of Nature can never aſſure you of it, nor ſecure you againſt this Severity: And the Scripture often repreſents him thus ſevere in his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, form'd by the Rules of his own Law, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted from the Goſpel of his Grace. <hi>David</hi> knew this in ancient times, <hi>Pſal.</hi> cxxx. 3. and cxliii. <hi>If thou, Lord, ſhouldeſt mark Iniquities; O Lord, who can ſtand? No Man living ſhall be juſtify'd in thy Sight.</hi> All Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are Sinners; <hi>There is none righteous; no, not one: Every Mouth is ſtopped, and the whole World lies guilty before God.</hi> Rom. iii. 19.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If we were entirely <hi>innocent as to Man,</hi> would that be ſufficient to anſwer for all our <hi>Injuries and Diſhonours done to God</hi>? Would this honeſt and blameleſs Conduct among your Neighbours, atone for all your Neglects of Religion, and your ſhameful Forgetfulneſs of God your Maker? What? Did God ſend you into this World among ſenſible things, and give you leave to neglect him, who is the Eternal and Almighty Spirit? Did he form your Spirits within you, and give you Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and Reaſon, and noble Powers to know the God that made you, and never require or expect that you ſhould uſe them to obtain this Knowledge? Have you a Tongue to ſpeak, and yet never ſpeak to him
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:006440_0146_1028F085C7164520"/>
in Petition or Praiſe? 'Tis not only Cruelty, or Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, or Injuſtice to our Neighbours, which the holy Apoſtle charges Mankind with, in order to lay their Conſciences under Guilt and Condemnation, but their Neglects of God and Religion are brought in as a heavy part of the Charge. Rom. iii. 11, 17, 18. <hi>There is none that underſtandeth, there is none that</hi> ſeeketh after God; <hi>there is no Fear of God before their Eyes.</hi> You hear the Accuſations of this Apoſtle, ſpeaking in the Name of God to Men, to make them ſenſible of their Guilt and Miſery; you have defrauded the great God of his due Glory; you have done him much Injury in withhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from him Worſhip and Reverence, Fear and Love, Prayer and Praiſe; and you fall under the Sentence of his broken Law for ever, if you have no better Plea than this.</p>
            <p>Under ſuch a Charge Multitudes would be ready to riſe up, and with a thoughtleſs and inconſiderate Pertneſs would ſay, <hi>Far be it from us to injure our Maker when we would not injure or wrong a Worm:</hi> And this is the common Sentiment and Language of Neighbours and Friends when a Man dies, even though he were a Drunkard or a Man of Irreligion. <hi>Alas, for him! Poor Man! he has been honeſt and juſt; his Soul is at reſt, he never did any body an Injury but himſelf</hi> When ſuch Sinners are charged with Neglect of Religion, they cry out as though they were falſely accuſed, as thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> do in <hi>Mal.</hi> iii. 8. When God complains of them, <hi>Ye have robbed me, ſaith the Lord</hi>; but they reply'd with Impudence and Ignorance, <hi>Wherein have we robbed or wronged thee</hi>?</p>
            <p>Alas, Sirs, you are far from Innocence in this Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect; for you have robbed God of your Hearts and beſt Affections; you have robbed him of your Thoughts and ſerious Meditations; you have robbed him of your higheſt Love and chief Delight. Were all the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:006440_0147_1028F08759600860"/>
of your Souls and Powers of Nature given you to be employ'd about the Trifles of this World? Doth not God, in the Perſon of Divine Wiſdom, call to Men in the Book of <hi>Proverbs, My Son, give me thy Heart</hi>? And hath not the World had theſe Hearts of yours given up to it entirely? Doth not the Light of Nature, as well as our Saviour, ſay, <hi>Love the Lord your God with your whole Heart, and your whole Soul, with all your Mind, and all your Strength</hi>? And hath God had all this ſhare of Love from you?</p>
            <p>What time have you ever ſpent in his Service, in ſecret Tranſactions between God and your own Souls? What Seaſons have you taken for Prayer to him, or for ſpeaking his Honours? And yet our time is all his: And though he gives us ſufficient Portions of time for all our Neceſſaries and Conveniencies of Life, yet have you not robbed God of much of your time in neglecting Religion ſo entirely as you have done? Have you lived upon the Lord as your Delight and your Life? Have you made him your Hope and your All? Have you daily expected all your Comforts and Bleſſings from him, and have you returned all the Fruits of your Bleſſings back again to him in a way of Thankfulneſs and Obedience? Surely your Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences muſt anſwer, <hi>No:</hi> Then believe it and be afraid; <hi>you have robbed God,</hi> you have injur'd the Almighty, you are far from Innocency, and you muſt expect to periſh with Malefactors, if you have no better Plea than this.</p>
            <p>O diſmal Change of Apprehenſions, when God ſhall make Creatures, who thought they were innocent, appear abominable in his Sight, guilty of Atheiſm and Irreligion and high Ungodlineſs, and ſhall judge and ſentence and puniſh them as Criminals of a deep Dye, for <hi>God was not in all their Thoughts,</hi> they lived <hi>without God in the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="unknown:006440_0148_1028F08A1059B310"/>Dare not therefore, O Sinners, dare not continue one Day longer in this Practice: Renounce and abandon your falſe and fooliſh Hopes: Walk no longer in this vain, this dangerous, this ſuppoſed Way of Innocency, for it will never bring you to God and his Favour. Nor go on to think yourſelf fit for Heaven, becauſe you imagined you had done no wrong on Earth, for upon a ſerious Search you muſt be convinced in your Conſciences, that you have been evident Tranſgreſſors againſt the Law of God, both in regard of the Duties of Religion and Morality, in what you owe both to God and Man; and Innocency will be found a falſe and vain Plea at the Bar of God.</p>
            <p>But I will go one Step further in making it appear with abundant Evidence, that the Way of pretended Innocency can never bring ſuch Creatures as we are into the Favour of God; and that is, by enquiring of ſuch as call themſelves <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> what is the Uſe of Chriſtianity, and why was it brought into the World? Surely, if Innocence had been the Way to Heaven, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> the Son of God would never have come into Fleſh and Blood, that he might die for us; God would never have ſent ſo glorious and divine a Perſon to have expoſed himſelf to ſo many Infirmities and Sorrows, Fatigues and Sufferings among the wretched Inhabitants of this our Globe, if we could have been ſaved in the Way of Innocence. Never would the Son of God have entered our World to have been driven out of this mortal Life again by cruel and bloody Men; nor ſuſtain'd the Shame, the Pangs and Agonies of the Croſs, and a curſed Death. There would have been no new Religion introduced by him; there would have been no Goſpel, for there needed none if we are ſaved by Innocence. The Coming of the Son of God into our World, his painful Circumſtances of Life, and his aton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:006440_0149_1028F08CCED25F60"/>
Death at the End of them, ſufficiently prove, that the Law of Innocency can never ſave Mankind.</p>
            <p>The Covenant or Law of Innocence was broken by our firſt Parents; our Natures are corrupted, and this Law or Covenant is for ever weak, and unable to bring us to God again. Rom. viii. 3. <hi>What the Law was not able to do in that it was weak through the Fleſh,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>came to do</hi> for us, by coming in the Fleſh, and making his Soul an <hi>Offering for Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If after all this Repreſentation of Things you are reſolved to continue in this way, and ſeek eternal Life in the way of Innocence, you give a ſenſible Affront to the Son of God, who came down from Heaven to bring Sinners near to God, and you ſay in effect, he might have ſpared his Journey to Earth to ſhew us the Way to Heaven, or to provide a new Way for us, for we have done no Harm to God or Man here in this World, and therefore God will not condemn or hurt us in the other. O my Friends, beg of God to convince you deeply of Sin, and that there is no Hope by all your Pretences of this Kind.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſecond miſtaken Way of coming to God is by a mere Dependance on the abſolute and ſovereign Goodneſs of his Nature,</hi> while you neglect the particular Methods of Salvation which you hear and read he has appointed in the Book of his Grace. 'Tis true, his <hi>tender Mercies are over all his Works,</hi> and Men imagine this eternal Love to his Creatures will not ſuffer him to make any of them miſerable hereafter, for what they call a little Miſconduct here: And while they leſſen their own Sins, and enlarge upon his Goodneſs, they venture their Souls upon an unſafe Foundation, and build up a dangerous and ungrounded Hope. Fancy his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, O Sinners, as large and glorious as you will, and I may venture to affirm it yet larger and more glorious than your Fancy; but if all your Hopes reſt here, and
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:006440_0150_1028F090E3890FA8"/>
you walk onward in this Confidence, you will never ſee the Face of God with Comfort; nor arrive at his Favour. Remember this is ſpoken particularly, and only, to thoſe who have known and heard the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and yet have neglected to receive it.</p>
            <p>Yet how common a Miſtake is this, even among thoſe who are called by the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Name? Many will confeſs, <q>We are Sinners indeed, and ſo are all Men; but God is infinitely merciful, and he will not damn us: Surely he will never condemn ſo many Millions of Souls; he did not make Mankind to deſtroy them; his Goodneſs will not bear to ſee us eternally miſerable, and therefore tho' we do indulge a little Sin here, we ſhall not periſh for ever.</q> Thus that very Sin is committed, which the Apoſtle warns Men of, <hi>Rom.</hi> ii. 4. <hi>The Riches of the Goodneſs and Forbearance and Long-ſuffering of God</hi> which <hi>ſhould lead Men to Repentance</hi> are abuſed to indulge and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them in Sin. 'Tis a ſhamefui Indignity and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour done to the Goodneſs of God, to pretend to truſt to it for Salvation from Puniſhment, and yet neglect the Means this very Goodneſs hath appointed to obtain it. But I will endeavour to convince you here, that this is not a ſufficient or a ſafe Way.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Infinite Goodneſs doth not ſave ſinning Angels, and why ſhould it ſave ſinning Men</hi>? Thoſe noble Creatures, who ſinned again God, and <hi>left their firſt Station,</hi> are for ever damned and miſerable, and yet God is for ever Good: How largely is his Goodneſs diffuſed through all the <hi>Heavenly</hi> World, and he receives endleſs <hi>Hallelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jahs</hi> for it; how largely on this <hi>Earth,</hi> though we often overlook it, and neglect his Praiſe: But he is not bound to exerciſe Goodneſs in Hell too; nor is his Heart to be charged with Hardneſs, nor his Hand with Shortneſs, becauſe he will not ſave thoſe who deſerve Deſtruction.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="136" facs="unknown:006440_0151_1028F09374096558"/>2. <hi>Though the Goodneſs of God be infinite in its Nature, yet its Exerciſes are all regulated and limited by Wiſdom and Juſtice</hi>; and theſe are alſo infinite. Wiſdom hath join'd with Divine Goodneſs, and ſaved a Multitude of Sinners; but is it bound to ſave them all? Or is it obliged to ſave you? Terrible Majeſty, Holineſs and conſuming Fire are with our God; and among rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Creatures, his Wiſdom finds proper Seaſons and Objects where theſe muſt have their Exerciſe: And if you are Sinners, why ſhould not his juſt Vengeance be let out upon you? It is a dreadful Word which is written, Iſa. xxvii. 11. <hi>This is a People of no Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: therefore he that made them will not have Mercy on them, and he that formed them will ſhew them no Favour.</hi> Thoſe who are ſo ignorant of God and his Way of Salvation in the midſt of the brighteſt Means of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, deſerve Deſtruction from the Almighty, as the Fool who ſays in his Heart <hi>There is no God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>There is no Promiſe in the Goſpel made to thoſe that reſt on Infinite Goodneſs, and refuſe the Means God has ordain'd to Salvation, i. e.</hi> Repentance towards God, and Faith in our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Goodneſs, when it is not bound by a Promiſe, is perfectly free: And, indeed, if it were confin'd always to act to the utmoſt of its reach, it were not free, nor divine, nor worthy of God. And where there is no divine Faithfulneſs engaged to ſupport you by a Promiſe, a Sinner's Hope in Goodneſs itſelf will not be a ſufficient and effectual Security.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Though the Goodneſs of God is infinite, yet it doth not expreſs itſelf in all the Ways that it can do in temporal Things, and why muſt it then he exerciſed in ſo unbounded a Manner in Things eternal</hi>? If Divine Goodneſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted itſelf to the utmoſt in this Life, there would be no Pain, there would be no Sickneſs among Men, no Heart-ake, no Sorrow: But you ſee there is much
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:006440_0152_1028F09502B680F8"/>
Sickneſs, Sorrow and Pain among us, notwithſtanding the boundleſs Goodneſs of God. There are ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ways for Infinite Goodneſs to expreſs itſelf in, beſides in Forgiveneſs of the Sins of Men.</p>
            <p>How do you know that God will forgive any one Sinner, or beſtow upon him eternal Life? The Light of Nature cannot aſſure us of it, much leſs can the Light of Nature inform us, that a God of Infinite Goodneſs will pardon every Sinner, or ſave them from the Puniſhment which is due by his righteous Law. And I am well aſſured the Scripture gives us no ſuch general Hope: Thouſands and Millions will be <hi>puniſhed with everlaſting Deſtruction from the Preſence of the Lord</hi> Jeſus, <hi>and from the Glory of his Power,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his own and his Father's unſearchable Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Grace and Goodneſs. The Lord is abundant in Goodneſs, and yet Earth and Hell abound in miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Creatures.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Although you could prove that the Mercy of God will pardon ſome Sinners, yet how can you be ſure it will pardon you</hi>? If you were told, that it will ſave a Million of Tranſgreſſors, yet can you ever prove that it will ſave you? Nay, as highly ſovereign as you fancy it to be, you may be ſtill excluded from the Exerciſe of it; for you may as well imagine this to be one Inſtance of Sovereignty, to forgive thouſands, and yet puniſh you, if you have nothing elſe to plead but his mere Goodneſs. Now it is not wiſe to venture ſo important an Intereſt as that of an Immortal Soul upon any Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty whatſoever, if it can be avoided; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your own Principle of Dependance on So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Mercy, you are left at a dreadful Uncertainty, if you have nothing elſe to truſt to but the mere Sovereignty of Divine Goodneſs.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>You have over and over again, by repeated Sins, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited all Pretences to the Favour and Mercy of God</hi>:
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:006440_0153_1028F096903CFB80"/>
Whatſoever Ground you have had to hope in his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet you have cut off all thoſe Grounds by your frequent actual Iniquities. Let us enter into Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and ſurvey a little what Claims, what Pretences you have to truſt in this abſolute Goodneſs of God.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Will you ſay, <hi>You are his Creature, and he is your Maker and Owner, therefore you truſt him to ſave what is his own</hi>? But remember that every Sin of yours has diſowned his Dominion, violated his Authority, and forfeited his Love and all his kind Regards, as a Creator and Proprietor.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Will you plead, <hi>You have obey'd him, and done much Service for him, and therefore you hope his Goodneſs will reward you</hi>? But have you not done more againſt him? Surely your Sins are more than your Acts of Piety, and they cancel all pretended Obligations you could hope to lay upon a God: I fear, ſhould all our Virtues and Devotions be put into the Scale againſt our Vices and Sins, they would be found greatly want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Weight.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Will you add this Plea, <hi>You are in a miſerable State, and you truſt in his Compaſſion that he will not leave poor ſinful wretched Beings in a State of Miſery</hi>? But have you not affronted him ſince your Miſeries began, and ſinned againſt him, even in your Bonds? And is not his Compaſſion thereby utterly forfeited? Beſides, might not fallen Angels make the ſame Plea as you do? Are they not in great Miſery? And yet are they not bound in Chains of Darkneſs, becauſe of their Sins, and ſhut up to further Vengeance.</p>
            <p>O ſee what an uncertain Foundation your Souls lean upon, when you venture to truſt in the mere ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Mercy of God, and his Goodneſs, without his, Goſpel. 'Tis a Goodneſs ſovereign and abſolutely free, and therefore not bound to ſave ſuch Wretches as you from Miſery: 'Tis a Goodneſs that can ſee
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:006440_0154_1028F09B1224E1D8"/>
ſinning Angels periſh for ever, and not help them: 'Tis a Goodneſs that is regulated in its Exerciſes, by infinite Wiſdom and Righteouſneſs, and the Authority and Juſtice of a divine Governor, and theſe muſt have their proper Exerciſes too: It is abſolute Goodneſs without a Promiſe, without Engagement; Goodneſs that has ten thouſand ways to exerciſe itſelf beſides in forgiving Criminals: It is a Goodneſs that may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give ten thouſand Sinners, and not forgive you; and it is a Goodneſs too, that you have ſo often diſhonour'd, whoſe Favours you have ſo ſhamefully forfeited and abuſed. Stand and wonder then that it is not turned into Fury againſt you long ago without Change and without Hope.</p>
            <p>Surely ſince I have a Soul of Immortal Duration, I'll ſtrive to have better Reſt and Support for it than this is, and never venture it here, ſince there is a ſtronger and better Hope. Ye holy and happy Souls that have learnt the new and living Way of coming to the Father, bleſs him, that he has not left you to ſeek all your Salvation from abſolute and unpromiſed Goodneſs: Bleſs him that has bound his Goodneſs by many a kind Promiſe to you in his Goſpel, and ſeal'd it with the Blood of his own Son.</p>
            <p>We proceed now to conſider the <hi>third falſe or miſtaken Way of coming into the Favour of God,</hi> and that is <hi>by Self-Righteouſneſs</hi>: For when we are made ſenſible that none is innocent, and the Goodneſs of God in general is not ſufficient Ground enough to raiſe and ſupport a ſolid and aſſured Hope, then we are ready to offer ſomething of our own to God, to engage this general Goodneſs of his on our Side, and make our Righteouſneſs the way to procure divine Favour, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting that God ſhould exerciſe and expreſs his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards us, in the Bleſſings of Pardon and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion This <hi>Self-Righteouſneſs</hi> may be divided into four Sorts.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="140" facs="unknown:006440_0155_1028F09DBAFB6168"/>1. Penances and Mortifications, Sorrow and Regret of Soul, with all our own fancied Atonements for Sin.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Works of Charity to the Poor.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Forms of Religious Worſhip.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Outward Reformation with Vows and Labour after better Obedience.</p>
            <p>Let us examine each of theſe briefly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Penances and Mortifications, and our own Remorſe of Conſcience and Regret of Soul, together with many fancied Atonements for Sin:</hi> Thus the <hi>Heathens,</hi> ancient and modern. What Tortures have ſome of them inflicted on themſelves for the Expiation of their own Sins, or the Sins of their Country? So great and powerful hath been their Senſe of the Guilt of Sin, that large Sacrifices, and dreadful ones too, have been propoſed by ſome of them for this Purpoſe, <hi>Micah.</hi> vi. 6, 7. <hi>Thouſands of Rams, and ten thouſand Rivers of Oil,</hi> and ſome of them have actually offered their <hi>Firſt-born for their Tranſgreſſion, the Fruit of their Body for the Sin of their Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Gentiles,</hi> when they are a little conſiderate, one would think, muſt acknowledge God to be the Governor of the World, and that he is a great and dreadful God, who has, in very viſible Inſtances, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times manifeſted his Diſpleaſure againſt the Sins of Men, and <hi>revealed his Wrath from Heaven againſt their Unrighteouſneſs and Ungodlineſs:</hi> And under the Fear and Terror of his Vengeance they have ſometimes put on Sackcloth and lived in Aſhes: They have deny'd themſelves the common Food of Nature, and half famiſhed their Bodies with Abſtinence. So the <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> did at the Threatning of the Lord by <hi>Jonah</hi> the Prophet. Sometimes they have baniſh'd themſelves from Towns and Cities, and all Converſe with Men, into meer Deſarts and Caves of the Earth, and ſtrain'd their Limbs in painful Poſtures, for Years together, to
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:006440_0156_1028F09F49B438F0"/>
make Atonement for the Sins of the People; ſo ſome of the pretended Saints in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> have done. They have put themſelves in Iron Cages, with ſharp Spikes, to be carried about and wounded from Head to Foot, as ſome of the <hi>Bonzes</hi> in <hi>China;</hi> they have thrown themſelves under a heavy loaden Chariot of their huge Images and Idols, and been cruſhed to Death, as ſome of their holy Men in <hi>Malabar.</hi> But what hath all this avail'd to obtain the Favour of that God whom they have offended? Who hath required this at their Hands? And what Ground have they to think God will accept it?</p>
            <p>So alſo thoſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, who are fallen from the Doctrine that St. <hi>Paul</hi> once wrote to the <hi>Romans,</hi> have invented various Penances, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to come into the Favour of God by them: As though laſhing themſelves with Cords, could ſatisfy infinite Juſtice for their Crimes, and wearing Sackcloth on their Fleſh could make their polluted Souls pure and acceptable to God. In following Ages when the Prieſts were grown more crafty and covetous, they taught them to come to God by Money, and to buy Pardons for Sin and Titles to Heaven of the Pope. This was called a <hi>Commutation of Penance,</hi> and making their Purſe ſuffer inſtead of their Fleſh; and thus they compounded with the Juſtice of God for the Sins of their Souls. They laviſh away much Silver and Gold, to make Atonement before God for breaking his Law. Poor Attempts and hopeleſs Pretences, to remove the Diſpleaſure of a God, and make a Way for their favourable Acceſs to him! There have been ſome auſtere Perſons that have ſeparated themſelves from the lawful Cuſtoms of the World, and common Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of Life, in order to appeaſe their Conſciences for paſt Indulgence and Senſuality, as though God and his Holineſs, and his governing Wiſdom and Majeſty,
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:006440_0157_1028F0A0D45F5CD0"/>
would be as eaſily ſatisfy'd as their blinded Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>
            <p>Others again after Sin are terrify'd with Fears of Death and Deſtruction; and under theſe Impreſſions they ſeem to mourn for their Sins, and then fly to their Repentances and Tears to ſave them; though perhaps their Repentance and Regret of Conſcience carries no more Hatred of Sin in it than <hi>Judas</hi> had who hang'd himſelf for inward Vexation and Anguiſh of Soul.</p>
            <p>But if this Repentance were never ſo ſincere, is the great God obliged to pardon ſuch repeated Crimes and Iniquities as ours are, merely becauſe the Criminal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents? Do the Princes of the Earth think it neceſſary to forgive every Rebel and Traytor, becauſe he is ſorry he has been guilty of Treaſon and expoſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Puniſhment? Why then ſhould the King of Kings be bound to let every Criminal paſs without being puniſhed, merely becauſe he repents of his Wickedneſs? It will be ſaid perhaps, we have nothing better to offer than our Repentance. And what then? Muſt a poor Rebel be always pardon'd becauſe he has nothing to make Satisfaction to his injured Sovereign, beſides his own Tears? And yet there are too many who ſtill will hope that their Sins are waſhed away, and their Guilt atoned for, by their Sorrows and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentances; and ſome Chriſtian Divines have expreſſed themſelves a little too groſsly and unwarily on this Point.</p>
            <p>O let us have a Care of ſuch Miſtakes, and bleſs the Lord, that he hath taught us a better Laver than our own Tears, a more powerful Atonement than any of our Sorrows or Terrors. The Pollutions of the Soul by Sin require a better cleanſing, and Affronts to the Majeſty of Heaven demand a higher Satisfaction or
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:006440_0158_1028F0A413EFC280"/>
Recompence, than any that we can make with our utmoſt Efforts of this kind.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Others fly to <hi>Works of Charity to the Poor,</hi> or of <hi>ſuppoſed Piety towards God, performed either in Life or at Death.</hi> Hence ariſe ſome extraordinary Appearances of Liberality in the World: This Hope of making ſome Compenſation for Sin, lays the Foundation of Churches and Hoſpitals: And magnificent Structures ariſe upon the Earth to gain the Favour of the God of Heaven, who hath been provoked by former Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Whole Eſtates are ſometimes given away by old Sinners, and alienated from their natural Heirs and Poſſeſſors, even from needy Friends and Kindred, and are devoted to religious and charitable Uſes, in order to purchaſe Salvation for their Souls.</p>
            <p>If they are <hi>Proteſtants</hi> indeed, we can hardly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they have theſe actual Reaſonings within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as to infer, that God will be ſo much pleaſed with theſe Legacies, as to pardon their Sins for the ſake of ſuch a Liberality to the Church or the Poor; this is the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Doctrine of <hi>Merit,</hi> which as <hi>Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants</hi> we all renounce. But ſtill there is a ſecret work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Self-Righteouſneſs in the Hearts of Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes: And when upon a Death-bed they bequeath large Legacies to the Service of God, or the Relief of the Poor, they hope to breathe out their Spirit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably into the Hand of God the Father, with ſome Dependance on theſe Legacies, at leaſt as ſufficient Evidences of their Love to God, and with confident Expectations of obtaining his Salvation.</p>
            <p>But alas! what can a little Charity to the Poor do toward the Reconciliation of a God to an offending Creature. Is there any Force in this Reaſoning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I do a Kindneſs for a Fellow-Worm, therefore my Maker muſt love me, and forgive me all Affronts againſt him? Or becauſe I have given to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:006440_0159_1028F0A90FC016D8"/>
of God, ſome of thoſe worldly good things which he firſt beſtow'd upon me, therefore he muſt pardon all my former Iniquities, he muſt receive me for ever into his Favour, and confer upon me the Riches of Glory and the Inheritance of the Saints in Light? How weak and ignorant are theſe Reaſonings? And yet how many have been ready to lay the Streſs of their Hopes upon them, having nothing elſe within their View to truſt in?</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Forms and Obſervances of religious Worſhip,</hi> are another vain Pillar upon which Sinners lean and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port themſelves. This is a moſt common and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Deceit. How many thouſands are there, that by daily Attendance upon Solemnities of Worſhip and coming up to the Houſe of God, hope at laſt to come to the Arms of the Father with Acceptance? And eſpecially if they have practiſed ſecret Devotion too, in the common Rounds and Forms of it, and have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently bow'd their Knees to God in their Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, their Hope has riſen high; and though they have not arrived at a thorough change of Heart, and ſincere Love to God, yet they will preſume upon his Acceptance without any great Concern about the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let me ask ſuch ſort of Candidates for Heaven and Happineſs, whether a formal Round of Duties and Services, without the Heart and Soul in them, without ſincere Love to God and Delight in him, can ſo far pleaſe the bleſſed God, as to perſwade him to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect all the righteous Demands of his governing Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice for paſt Crimes? Or if your Hearts are ſometimes engaged in theſe Solemnities, is this ſufficient to cancel all former Tranſgreſſions?</p>
            <p>Beſides, if you have no Mediator, who ſhall intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch a Sinner, or his Duties, into the Preſence of God with Acceptance? May he not juſtly drive
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:006440_0160_1028F0AA9B13CB10"/>
us with all our ſolemn Formalities, afar from his Seat, ſince we neglect the only Hope ſet before us, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Name of his Son, without which no Man ſhall come to be accepted of the Father. John xiv. 6. <hi>No Man cometh to the Father but by me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The laſt thing I mention, on which ſome Perſons are prone to depend, in order to obtain divine Favour and Forgiveneſs, is a <hi>Courſe of outward Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and ſome Vows and ſome Endeavours after better Obedience:</hi> But I would endeavour in theſe few Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, to diſcover the Vanity of all Hopes of this kind.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Our Duties of Obedience are very imperfect: They do not in any Degree anſwer the ſtrict Demands of the Law and Juſtice of God; and the beſt of them are ſo defective that they can never claim or pretend to any Merit in them, ſince they do not come up to anſwer the Requirements of God in his general Rule of Government.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Our Obedience of to day cannot wipe away or cancel the Crimes of yeſterday or our paſt Life: Theſe Crimes ſtand like high and unpaſſable Mountains in the way betwixt God and us: Paying a new Debt never wipes off old Scores among Men, and why ſhould we imagine it will do ſo before the Throne of God?</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Were our Duties perfect, yet 'tis not only a guilty, but a worthleſs Creature, a mere polluted Worm performs them; and the eternal Favour of an offended God is not to be purchaſed for Rebels at ſo cheap a rate.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) It is true, 'tis by Duties of Worſhip we muſt draw near unto God, and by the Acts of our Mind and Will, by Knowledge, Aſſent, Faith, Truſt, Hope, Prayer and Repentance, we muſt come to God; but 'tis ſtill by and through the Mediation and Intereſt
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:006440_0161_1028F0AD124F0AD0"/>
of <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Son, that theſe Acts of the Soul muſt be addreſs'd to the Father. Theſe conſider'd alone in themſelves, are not preſcribed in my Text as the Way itſelf, for <hi>Chriſt is the Way, the Truth and the Life:</hi> He is the only true and living Way to God: Theſe Actions perform'd with a due regard to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are properly our walking in the way which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; but if we have no regard to <hi>Chriſt</hi> in theſe Actions, we are not walking in God's Way, nor can we raiſe any ſolid Hope that we ſhall arrive at his gracious Preſence, while we neglect or refuſe the only Way which God has ordained.</p>
            <p>Perhaps ſome more intelligent or more conceited Hearers, may cry out here, why are theſe Rudiments and plain Principles of Chriſtianity preached to us? Surely we know better, and underſtand more of the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> than to make ſuch Diſcourſes neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for us to attend them.</p>
            <p>I <hi>anſwer,</hi> 1. However learned ſome may be in theſe Truths, yet perhaps there may be others coming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually into our Aſſemblies, who know little enough either of the Law or Goſpel; and they had need of the Doctrines of their own Guilt, and Miſery, and Danger, to be ſpoken in very plain and clear Language to them, before they will hearken and ſtand ſtill, and conſider their own Circumſtances, and their Peril: And the Nature of Man when under the Awakenings of Conſcience, is ſo prone to take hold of every falſe and feeb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> Refuge, and to venture their Eternal Hopes upon them, that it is very neceſſary to ſpeak theſe things often, and to repreſent them in the cleareſt Light, in order to caution Sinners againſt building their Hopes on the Sand, and reſting all their Expectation of the Favour of God and Happineſs, upon ſome feeble Foundation which will not bear them. 'Tis not the Wiſe and the Learned that I pretend to inſtruct; but
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:006440_0162_1028F0AECCF569D0"/>
it is pity any poor Soul, even of the loweſt Ranks of Mankind, ſhould abide ignorant of theſe important Concerns, and ſhould periſh in ſuch a Land of Light, and for want of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Knowledge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. Let us ſearch diligently our own Hearts. Have we all attained and kept up ſuch a due Senſe of our Danger without <hi>Chriſt</hi> as we ſhould have? Are we never inclined to depend on Self-Righteouſneſs at all? Are we never under any Temptation to indulge this falſe Hope? Some pious Souls have complain'd of this Temptation, and corrupt Nature is very ready in the beſt of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> to build up ſome Parts of their own Righteouſneſs as their ſufficient Refuge, and ſometimes to put it in place of the perfect Mediation and Atonement of the Bleſſed <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 3. However the Caſe be now with us, and if we have truly got the Victory over all Temptations of this Kind, yet it is very proper to remember what once we were, and reflect upon what falſe Hopes we once were ready to build on, and to bleſs the Holy Spirit of Light and Grace, that hath diſcover'd our Miſtakes unto us, that has turned our Feet from every dangerous Hope, and led us to the Father by the true and living way <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let this Thought alſo call us to mourn over the Souls of Men, even the greateſt Part of our Fellow Creatures, Inhabitants of this World, who are made of the ſame Fleſh and Blood as we are, and who, through groſs Ignorance, are ever practiſing ſome fooliſh Methods of pacifying God for paſt Sins, and aiming at his Favour and Happineſs in ſuch Ways as will never attain their End. O Come, Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and ſpread thy Light and thy Truth through the dark Nations, and ſcatter all the remaining Miſts and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes that lie upon Countries which have only the Name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſome of the Forms of his Religion

Thouſands there are, even in <hi>Europe,</hi> who neither know the Goſpel in Truth, nor come to God by this Mediator: They live not by the Faith of the Son of God, nor have juſt Reaſon, according to the Goſpel, to expect divine Favour and Forgiveneſs.

            <p>The next <hi>Eſſay</hi> will ſhew us a plain and eaſy Account of <hi>Faith in Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>of coming to God by Chriſt:</hi> I acknowledge, I have been ſometimes uneaſy and aſhamed to hear a Divine of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Church tell his People, that <hi>Faith in Chriſt</hi> is a myſterious Thing, and it is not to be well known, or clearly conceived in itſelf, but it may be much <hi>better conceived by its Effects, therefore,</hi> ſaith he, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, inſtead of ſpeaking of <hi>Faith itſelf,</hi> to give you an Account of the <hi>Fruits</hi> and <hi>Effects</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>As though there was any thing in the Affairs of human Life, in Reaſon, or in Religion, clearer than this Notion, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Upon a Sight and Senſe of our Sins and Dangers, and our Weakneſs to help our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to commit ourſelves into the Hands of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by an humble Act of Truſt or Dependance on him, complying with his appointed Methods of Relief in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>'Tis but as a Man ſenſible of his Sickneſs applies himſelf to a wiſe and knowing Phyſician, and gives himſelf up to him, and truſts himſelf in his Hands to relieve him, complying with the Remedies appointed in order to his Cure: which I hope will appear very plain in the following <hi>Eſſay.</hi>

            <p>INNOCENT Man in the Day of his Creation had a Liberty of drawing near to God his Maker, and of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful Converſe with him in a more immediate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; but Man having fallen from God, and becoming guilty in his Perſon, and ſinful in his Nature, dwells in this World afar off from God; and yet ſometimes would attempt to approach him, and obtain his Favour again merely by his own Powers and Performances; as though the Goodneſs of God would receive him again into his Preſence, and into his Love in the ſame manner as before. Sinful Mankind have been often trying to make their way to God in and of themſelves: Thence ariſe thoſe various <hi>mistaken Grounds of Hope,</hi> of which we have given an Account in the former Diſcourſe: But the Bleſſed God has ſufficiently informed us in the Word of his Goſpel, that it is in vain for us to hope to draw near to God, our offended Sovereign, without a Mediator; and there is <hi>but one Mediator</hi> of God's Appointment <hi>between God and Man,</hi> and that is <hi>the Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi>

1 Tim. ii. 5. and <hi>No Man cometh to the Father but by him,</hi> John xiv. 6.</p>
            <p>Now in order to explain <hi>what it is for Sinners to come to God the Father by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> let us conſider that all ſaving Approaches of the Creature unto God, depend on God's Approaches to the Creature: He firſt draws us by his Grace, and then we follow. Jer. xxxi. 3. <hi>I have loved thee with an everlaſting Love, therefore with Lovingkindneſs have I drawn thee.</hi> 1 John iv. 19. <hi>If we love him it is becauſe he loved us firſt.</hi> If our Souls are ſet a moving towards him, it is becauſe his Heart, his Pity and his Love moved firſt towards us.</p>
            <p>In the Reconciliation of God and his ſinful Creatures, there muſt be a mutual Approach, and a mutual Near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but it muſt be remember'd, that the Sinners coming nigh to God, is but an Eccho or Anſwer to the merciful Voice of God coming nigh to him: And the ſame Method in which we may ſuppoſe the great God to draw near to Sinners, the ſame Steps ſhould we take in drawing near to God.</p>
            <p>It muſt be granted, indeed, that all the Acts of God are eternal, and his Decrees have no Order of Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as they are in him: The eternal Mind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Ends and Beginnings of all things at once; but there are many Expreſſions in Scripture which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to our Frailty, and teach us to conceive of the infinite and eternal Things of God by way of Time and Succeſſion, that we may obtain a fuller and clearer Underſtanding of them; for no created Mind is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious enough to graſp all the divine Decrees in one ſingle Thought, as that God does who formed them.</p>
            <p>It ſhould be obſerved alſo, that though the Actions of the Soul of Man are generally produced in a ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Way, yet ſometimes two or three of theſe Acts are ſo ſwift in their Succeſſion, and ſo nearly ſimulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous,
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:006440_0166_1028F0BC1D9B29A0"/>
or at the ſame Moment that they are blended together, or are ſo interwoven in many Caſes, that it is hard to ſay, which is firſt, and which is laſt: And many times alſo, in one and the ſame Act of the Soul, there are ſuch different Views and Deſigns concurring, as may make it look like two or three diſtinct Actions: So <hi>returning to God by Jeſus Chriſt</hi> includes in it both <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> with all the Acts contained therein, as well as <hi>Faith,</hi> with all its ſubordinate Motions: It is <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> as it is a Return to God; it is <hi>Faith</hi> as <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is the Medium of this Return. I put in this Caution here, only to ſhew, that we are not to expect every ſingle Sinner that returns to God by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> muſt have all theſe particular Motions of the Soul, or all theſe Tranſactions ſenſibly paſſing through his Mind, and that in the ſame Order as is here repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented; yet the Repreſentation of theſe Things in ſome rational Order, may greatly help the Conception of the whole, and give Perſons ſomewhat of a more clear and more diſtinct Idea of it.</p>
            <p>Let us then here take a Survey of thoſe <hi>ſeveral Steps, whereby God may be ſuppoſed to draw near to fallen Man, in order to his Recovery,</hi> and thereby we ſhall learn <hi>what correſpondent Steps Sinners muſt take, in order to their coming to God.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. The Bleſſed God ſurveying his lower Creation, beheld all Mankind as Creatures in general <hi>fallen from his Image and his Love,</hi> and at a wide and dreadful Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from their Creator. Compare the XIVth <hi>Pſalm</hi> 2, 3. Verſes with <hi>Rom.</hi> iii. 9, 10, <hi>&amp;c. The Lord looked down from Heaven upon the Children of Men, to ſee if there were any that did underſtand and ſeek God: they are all gone aſide, they are altogether become filthy; there is none that doth Good, no, not one.</hi> This Text of the Pſalmiſt is cited by the Apoſtle in <hi>Rom.</hi> iii. 9, 10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to prove that all Mankind is afar off from God by
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:006440_0167_1028F0BDA72DA1F0"/>
Nature; and therefore I may juſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> uſe this Scripture, to prove that God <hi>beheld us</hi> in this fallen Eſtate; he ſaw us lie under the righteous Condemnation of his broken Law, juſtly expoſed to Miſery, and deſerving his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation and Wrath, under a Sentence of Death, and yet ſtill going farther from him without his Fear or his Love.</p>
            <p>Now in correſpondence with this View, which God has taken of the Children of Men, in their Guilt and Miſery in general; we alſo, in order to our Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, muſt be brought to ſee ourſelves <hi>guilty and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,</hi> we muſt ſee ourſelves deſtitute of the Image and the Love of <hi>God</hi> in our fallen State of Nature, if ever we would return to him by <hi>Chriſt</hi> and Grace.</p>
            <p>God, who is eſſentially happy in being for ever near himſelf, and one with himſelf, has made the Happineſs of his Creatures to depend on their being near to him, and their Union with him; and he knows it is Miſery enough to be afar off from God: So muſt we be made deeply ſenſible of our Wretchedneſs and Miſery in the Loſs of the Favour and Image of God, and in our dreadful State of Diſtance and Eſtranged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from him. We muſt behold ourſelves expoſed to the Wrath of God, and under Sentence of juſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation and Death, becauſe of Sin. We muſt ſee it ſo as to feel it, and be affected with it at our Heart; we muſt have ſuch an Impreſſion of it made upon our Souls, ſo as never to be ſatisfied to continue in ſuch a State, and be reſtleſs in ſeeking ſome way of Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, as I ſhall ſhew more particularly afterwards.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The great God ſurveying his own glorious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in himſelf, and the juſt Rights of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, taking a View alſo of the Holineſs, Juſtice and Wiſdom of his Law, which ſinful Man had grievouſly diſhonoured and affronted by Diſobedience; he did not think it proper for himſelf as the Supreme Governor
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:006440_0168_1028F0C051187700"/>
of the World, to receive ſinful Creatures into his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour again, without <hi>ſome ſignal Honour done to his broken Law and his Authority;</hi> as a ſort of righteous Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for the Affront and Diſhonours done thereto by the Offence of his Creatures. It became the great God to make his Law appear wiſe and juſt, by demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a Reparation of the Diſhonour done to it.</p>
            <p>But he found <hi>all Mankind utterly uncapable of making any ſuch Recompence,</hi> ſince all that they could do for time to come was but their known Duty to their Creator, and none of their Sufferings ſhort of Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and eternal Death could make Atonement or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for the Sins that were paſt: And in this View of things the great God did, as it were, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Recovery of his Creature Man, by all his own Powers and Capacities, altogether hopeleſs, and that his Recovery muſt ariſe only from divine Grace.</p>
            <p>In correſpondence to this View of Things in the Eye of God, we ſhould alſo ſet before our own Eyes the Holineſs, Juſtice and Wiſdom of the Law of our Creator, in order to make ourſelves deeply ſenſible of our great Guilt, in breaking his Law, and our <hi>Deſert of Death</hi> by the Tranſgreſſion of it: We ſhould alſo be made ſenſible in ſome meaſure of the <hi>Right of his divine Authority and Government to demand ſome Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for our Offences,</hi> before we be received into his Favour again. The very Workings of natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience under a Senſe of Guilt, ſeem to be an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion from the God of Nature on the Mind of Man, that Sin deſerves Puniſhment, becauſe the Law of a God broken, requires ſome Reparation of Honour<note n="*" place="bottom">This is so univerſal in all Ages among the conſiderate Part of Mankind, that the <hi>Heathens</hi> themſelves, in their own Circumſtances, tho't a <hi>Nemeſis</hi> or vindictive Indignation of God would attend on Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. <hi>Acts</hi> xxviii. 4. They tho't St. <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>a Murderer,</hi> and therefore <hi>Vengeance</hi> followed him. And this ſet them upon various and fooliſh Inventions, to make Atonement for Sin: Nor is it to be ſuppoſed, that the Craft of Prieſts alone, could ſo eaſily and ſo univerſally have impoſed on the Nations their Self Puniſhments, and their expenſive Sacrifices of Atonement, if there had not been ſomething in the natural Conſciences of Mankind, which told them they wanted an Atonement for Sin. And in this Reſpect the Workings of natural Conſcience ſhould be encouraged, and kept awake, and ſenſible of the Wrath of God, which Sin deſerves, and that God will require ſome Satisfaction to his injured Law and Government.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="154" facs="unknown:006440_0169_1028F0C1DB59B198"/>On this Account we ought to reflect on ourſelves as the more miſerable and helpleſs in our guilty State, becauſe we are utterly incapable to make any Atonement for our own Sins, or to repair the Diſhonour that hath been done to God's holy Law and his Authority thereby. We muſt look upon our Circumſtances therefore as hopeleſs in our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and acknowledge that all our Hope is in the free Grace and Mercy of God. <hi>Every Mouth muſt be ſtopped</hi> on this Account, and <hi>all the World lie</hi> at the Foot of God, as <hi>guilty before him,</hi> as juſtly expoſed to his Indignation, and unable to procure his Favour.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The great God ſaw it alſo impoſſible to bring Sinners near to himſelf, and make them Partakers of his Favour and Happineſs, <hi>without a Change of their corrupt Natures, an intire Alteration of their vicious Affections,</hi> and an univerſal Turn of Heart from Sin to God. In our preſent fallen and ſinful State, God beheld our Hearts ſo averſe to all that is holy and divine, that we could never be fit for Converſe with him, or the Enjoyment of him as a God of Holineſs, without being renew'd after his Image and Likeneſs, and poſſeſſed of a ſincere Love to him.</p>
            <p>And he alſo beheld theſe guilty ſinful Creatures <hi>utterly uncapable of recovering themſelves to his Image by a Change of their Natures,</hi> and by a thorough Converſion of their
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:006440_0170_1028F0C6C6A241E8"/>
Hearts from Sin, and the Creature to God and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: So that this is another Obſtacle in the Sight of God to our Reconciliation, and which we of ourſelves cannot ſurmount.</p>
            <p>In the ſame manner, in order to our Recovery, we muſt look upon ourſelves in our fallen State, as <hi>unfit for Correſpondence with God,</hi> uncapable of enjoying Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in his Preſence, by reaſon of the Oppoſition of our Will to his Holineſs, and to our Duty, we muſt be ſenſible of the great Carnality of our Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions cleaving to earthly Things, and to the tempting Vanities of this Life, chuſing them for our Portion and our Happineſs inſtead of God.</p>
            <p>And we muſt be acquainted alſo <hi>how weak and feeble all our Own Efforts are to work this mighty and univerſal change of Nature in us,</hi> to form our Spirits anew, and to rectify all the Moral Diſorders in them: We muſt be made ſenſible how uncapable we are of giving our Souls a new Bent and Biaſs toward things divine and heavenly, inſtead of that ſinful Propenſity which works in our Natures, and is ever leading us aſtray from God and true Happineſs; ſo that if ever we are recovered, we muſt depend entirely upon the free Grace and Mercy of God for our whole Recovery; not only to provide a Satisfaction for his own injur'd Law and Authority, but alſo to take away the Perverſeneſs and Obſtinacy of our Wills, and to change our vile Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions into holy and heavenly.</p>
            <p>This is that Poverty of Spirit, that Senſibility of our own helpleſs State, which is the firſt Foundation of the Kingdom of God within us. So our Saviour teaches, Matt. v. 3. <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in Spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of God.</hi> This is that Humility of Soul which the Men of <hi>Laodicea</hi> wanted, <hi>Rev.</hi> iii. 17. When they were really great Sinners before God, they <hi>ſuppoſed themſelves rich, and increaſed in Goods, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:006440_0171_1028F0C85046B3C8"/>
nothing:</hi> But before they were recovered it was neceſſary they ſhould ſee <hi>they were Poor and Blind, and Wretched and Naked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Though God beheld Mankind in theſe deplorable and helpleſs Circumſtances, yet he was pleaſed, out of his free Grace, <hi>to decree and determine, that they ſhould not all periſh.</hi> He reſolved to bring ſome off at leaſt, out of their State of Diſtance from him, and to reſtore them to his Favour, his Image, to Holineſs and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Whether this gracious Will and Deſign of God, be ſo clearly and ſufficiently diſcover'd, to the Light of Nature, in his providential Goodneſs to all the World, I will not now debate: But it is ſufficiently diſcover'd in the Goſpel, or the Book of Grace.</p>
            <p>In correſpondence with this gracious Deſign and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the bleſſed God, 'tis neceſſary that we alſo ſhould <hi>have ſome Hope and Belief of God's Willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be reconciled,</hi> or that there is Grace and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion with him for returning Sinners. Heb. xi. 6. <hi>He that cometh to God muſt believe that he is a Rewarder of thoſe that diligently ſeek him:</hi> And in this View, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and Hope, we ſhould <hi>reſolve never to reſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in ſuch deplorable Circumſtances:</hi> But deſire and ſtrive with all our Powers to return to God, and never be content without obtaining his Favour and his Image, we ſhould humbly reſolve and determine that we will not periſh, but that we will return to the great God, through the Aids and Encouragements of his Grace, in what way and manner ſoever he is pleaſed to return unto us. In this Senſe we may ſay that <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> or the Bleſſings of Salvation <hi>ſuffer Violence,</hi> as our Saviour expreſſes it, Matt. xi. 12. <hi>And the Violent take it by Force.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This holy Deſire with ſome Degree of Reſolution, ſeems to be the firſt Step or Motion of the <hi>Will</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God; theſe are the Beginnings of true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:006440_0172_1028F0CB58ED1A80"/>
flowing from Faith or Hope in divine Mercy; this is the firſt Work of a ſaving Converſion, even a Reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs of Soul in this State of Diſtance from God, and under the Hope of his Mercy, a ſincere Deſire and holy Reſolution of Heart to return towards him, as our Portion and our everlaſting Happineſs. This is that <hi>Repentance towards God, and Faith in his Mercy,</hi> which was neceſſary in all Ages, and in all Nations, and under every Diſpenſation, in order to the Salvation of ſinful Mankind from their State of Miſery, and in order to return to God.</p>
            <p n="5">5. When God deſign'd to recover Man to himſelf, and reſtore him to his Favour, he deſign'd alſo <hi>to ſecure a due Honour to his Government for all times to come, and Obedience to his Authority in all his future Demands</hi>: And for this End Man muſt be made, in ſome meaſure, to feel the Evil of Sin by the painful Conſequences of it, <hi>viz. Shame and Remorſe of Conſcience, and holy Sorrow for his paſt Tranſgreſſions:</hi> And God deſign'd that theſe Actings of the Soul ſhould have a powerful and a laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Influence, through his Grace, to make Man hate every Sin, and fear and avoid it, and awaken him to conſtant ſincere Endeavours of univerſal Obedience to a forgiving God for time to come.</p>
            <p>Agreeably to this Deſign of God, the ſinful Creature muſt ſeek to have his Heart in ſome Meaſure, <hi>painfully affected with Shame and Sorrow, for his paſt Folly and Diſobedience to his Creator</hi>; and muſt learn hereby to hate every Sin, and conſtantly avoid it, and he muſt endeavour after <hi>univerſal Compliance with the Will of God in all future Inſtances of Duty.</hi> Theſe are the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and neceſſary Operations and Attendants of all true Repentance whereſoever it is found, and will be in greater or leſs Degrees, working in the Heart of every Sinner that truly returns to God: For the great Deſign of God in all his Tranſactions of Grace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:006440_0173_1028F0CE62F0E2A0"/>
towards fallen Man, is to recover to himſelf <hi>a peculiar People, averſe to Sin and zealous of Good Works,</hi> and that under the Motives of his pardoning Love, and the Aids of his ſanctifying Grace, they walk before him in all Holineſs.</p>
            <p>This alſo belongs to all the ſeveral Diſpenſations of the Grace of God ever ſince the Fall of Man, and is required of every Creature who ſhould return to God.</p>
            <p n="6">6. In the New Teſtament the great God hath made much plainer Diſcoveries of the particular way of his return to ſinful Man (<hi>viz.</hi>) that <hi>he did not think fit to be reconciled to Men, or bring them back again to himſelf, without a Mediator</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">There may be ſeveral Reaſons why the bleſſed God thought fit to ſave Mankind by a Mediator, and not without one, as (1) To main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his own Honour and the Dignity of his Majeſty; for it does not ſeem ſo proper for a God of ſuch ſupreme Glory, to admit ſuch Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals immediately into his Favour, and his Preſence, and his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces, without ſome honourable Mediator to introduce them. (2) To do ſublime Honour to his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who is the expreſs Image of his Perſon and his firſt Favourite, that as by him God made the World, ſo by him Mankind ſhould be recovered, new-created, and reſtored to God's Favour and Image again. (3) To ſecure the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Man more effectually, uniting all the ſaved Number in one unfailing and all-ſufficient Head: And therefore his own Son was choſen for this Office, as being able to undertake all that was neceſſary completely to bring back Man to God.</note>. This was intimated in God's earlieſt Revelations of his Grace, when he ſpake of the <hi>Seed of the Woman,</hi> which ſhould <hi>break the Head of the Serpent,</hi> and deſtroy the Deſigns of the Tempter to ruin Mankind: But under the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Diſpenſation it is much more abundantly manifeſted: And finding no other Perſon ſufficient for this Work, God choſe his own Son to become a Mediator between God and Man; even that Son of his Love, who was <hi>one with the Father,</hi> and <hi>lay in his Boſom</hi> and <hi>had Glory with him</hi> there, <hi>before the Foundation of the World,</hi> that Son in <hi>whom dwelt all the
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:006440_0174_1028F0D0E4C6CB80"/>
Fulneſs of the Godhead,</hi> even that Son <hi>by whom he created</hi> the World and Mankind at firſt; it was by him, as a Mediator, that he deſign'd to recover Man from his Ruins, his Guilt and his Wretchedneſs.</p>
            <p>This was the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> whom God promiſed to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> who ſhould be one of his Poſterity, and <hi>in whom all the Nations of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed.</hi> This was be whom God ſpoke of, and recommended by many of the Prophets, and deſcribed under ſeveral Types and Figures in ancient Ages, that when he came he might be better known and accepted by the World. This was he who <hi>in the Fulneſs of Time,</hi> was ſent to take Fleſh and Blood upon him, and to become a compleat Man. This is the one and <hi>only Mediator between God and Man, even the Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> who was alſo one with God.</p>
            <p>For this End it pleaſed the Father to furniſh him with every neceſſary Talent and Qualification: He anointed him with <hi>his Holy Spirit</hi> to dwell in him <hi>without Meaſure</hi>; he appointed him to be born of a Woman in low Circumſtances of Life, and to grow up through all the Stages of Infancy, Childhood, and Youth, to the Manly Age of Thirty; then he called and commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned him to be a publick Prophet and Teacher of the Goſpel, or the Way of Salvation: He ſet him up alſo for an Example of Humility and Love towards God and Man, and of Holineſs, Submiſſion and Patience, and univerſal Obedience thro' the Courſe of his Life, and then appointed him to die as an atoneing Sacrifice for the Sins of Men: <hi>God laid our Sins upon him,</hi> and <hi>ſet him forth,</hi> or fore-determin'd him <hi>to be a Propitiation for Sin through Faith</hi> or Truſt <hi>in his Blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is he whom <hi>God raiſed from the Dead and exalted him at his right Hand,</hi> to be an Interceſſor for ſinful Man there, in the Virtue of his Sacrifice, and to be
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:006440_0175_1028F0D3D581EF88"/>
the Head of vital Influence to Men, to work <hi>Repentance</hi> and Holineſs in their Hearts, as well as to be a <hi>Prince,</hi> or <hi>Lord and Saviour, to beſtow Forgiveneſs of Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God gave him alſo Power to Rule and Govern all things for the Good of his People, and ordained him to be Judge of the World at the great Day. And all this was deſigned of God, that his Son, <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Mediator, might anſwer every Neceſſity, and be able to ſupply every Want of ſinful Man, in order to his complete Salvation.</p>
            <p>Now in Correſpondence with theſe Counſels of God the Father, in order to bring fallen Man near to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, Sinners muſt believe the Truth and Certainty of God's Appointment, that they ſhall not come to him again without a Mediator; and they muſt have a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and well-ſettled Perſwaſion of this Divine Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
            <p>It is granted that there have been ſome ſuch Thoughts among Mankind, in all Ages: They have had ſome Notion of coming to God by a Mediator, from an awful Senſe of the Majeſty and Holineſs of God, and of their own Vileneſs and Unworthineſs, and their Deſert of his Diſpleaſure becauſe of Sin. So <hi>Job,</hi> when he had deſcribed his own Sinfulneſs, in the Sight of a pure and holy God, <hi>Chap.</hi> ix. <hi>ver.</hi> 30, 31. he adds, <hi>God is not a Man as I am, that I ſhould anſwer him, and we ſhould come together in Judgment; neither is there any Days-man betwixt us, that might lay his Hand upon both;</hi> for <hi>Job</hi> had not a clear Light at this time, of the great Mediator who was appointed, though 'tis plain he ſaw that he wanted one.</p>
            <p>So again the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> at mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> when they ſaw God in his terrible Appearances of Thunder and Lightning, and a Voice came from the Fire, they ſaid, <hi>Let not God ſpeak to us leſt we die, but let</hi> Moſes <hi>ſpeak
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:006440_0176_1028F0D65B792460"/>
to us and we will hear.</hi> Exod. xx. 19. they declare they wanted a Mediator.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Heathens</hi> had their lower Deities who were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, even by the Philoſophers, to be Mediators between them and the ſupreme God.</p>
            <p>Beſides, God tranſacts his great Affairs with Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, oftentimes according to the Language, Cuſtoms, and Manners of Men. Now 'tis the natural and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon way of Offenders, againſt a Superior, to get ſome Mediator to ſpeak for them, and bring them into Favour again.</p>
            <p>Mankind alſo, in order to this Reconciliation, muſt have ſome Knowledge of this Mediator: They muſt be <hi>acquainted with the moſt important Articles which God has revealed concerning this great Mediator Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are called to behold him and to ſurvey him in the Glory of his Perſonal Excellencies, in his original Fitneſs for this Work of a Reconciler, and in the ſeveral Offices which God has commiſſioned him to ſuſtain, as juſt before deſcribed. We muſt be made to ſee the bleſſed <hi>Jeſus</hi> in the Riches of his Grace, and his large and various Furniture for this great Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking: We muſt believe what God has pronounced concerning him, and from the bottom of our Hearts humbly approve of theſe Counſels for our Salvation. It muſt be the Language of our Hearts in a way of Eccho to the Appointment of God, <q>There is none like him, there is none like <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for a Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciler of the offended God and offending Man; he is every way a ſuitable Relief to our Wants, and all-ſufficient to ſave.</q>
            </p>
            <p>We muſt ſee him as one that has made full Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Satisfaction to the Juſtice and Majeſty of God, for the Sins of Men by his own Sufferings
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:006440_0177_1028F0D920816D28"/>
and Death<note n="*" place="bottom">Though it is not neceſſary for every Perſon among the fallen Race of <hi>Adam,</hi> to find out the real and eternal Neceſſity of his coming to God by a Mediator, or that ſuch an Atonement muſt needs be made for the Sins of Men, yet ſince God ſaw it moſt proper to appoint this way, and to ordain his Son <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be this Mediator and this Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to reveal it in ſo many plain and expreſs Declarations of his Word, I think it may be readily agreed, that it is our evident Duty, now we know this Goſpel, to approve of this Atonement ſo plainly revealed, and this Mediator, as a moſt reaſonable Appointment, and to come near to God by him, even by <hi>Faith in his Blood,</hi> if we would find certain Acceptance with God.</note>: We muſt approve of him as our great Teacher, and our glorious Example; as our High-Prieſt to reconcile us to God by his Blood, and to make Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for us at the Mercy-Seat in Heaven; as <hi>one that is able to ſave to the uttermoſt, becauſe he lives forever</hi> to fulfil all his Offices. We muſt behold him as a Lord and Governor appointed to rule over us, and to give us Laws, and to defend us from our Enemies: We muſt ſee him as the moſt proper Perſon to be our Head of vital Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for the Communication of all Grace and Holineſs to us, for the changing of our Natures into his Father's Image and his own; and as one that is able and willing to take Care of us through this World, and bring us ſafe into the Father's Preſence at laſt with exceeding Joy. Thus the Faith of the Sinner eccho's to the Voice of God concerning <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Saviour, in a way of Aſſent to what God has reveal'd, and in a way of humble Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of what God has appointed.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The Great God foreſeeing the Obſtinacy, Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Wickedneſs of the Heart of Man, well knew that all this Preparation to reſtore Mankind to Holineſs and Happineſs, might at laſt be ineffectual, and might all be perform'd in vain, unleſs he took one Step further; and therefore to ſecure this Salvation to many <hi>he gave them into the Hands</hi> of his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>committed
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:006440_0178_1028F0DD48E75F88"/>
the Care of their Salvation to him</hi>; he gave them to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or entruſted him with the Care of them, that he might fulfil his whole Commiſſion, and all his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Offices, in a moſt effectual and powerful manner with regard to them; appointing alſo that this ſame Goſpel ſhould be preached to the reſt of Mankind, and the Offers of this Salvation ſhould be made to them ſome way or other, in various Seaſons, in plainer or darker Diſcoveries thereof. Therefore though the Goſpel be ſent to be preached to all the World in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and Salvation to be offer'd them through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> yet we are told often by the Evangeliſt <hi>John,</hi> of thoſe particular Perſons whom the Father had given unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that they might be his, <hi>i. e.</hi> his Seed, his Subjects, and his willing People.</p>
            <p>In Conformity to this great Act of the Father in committing the Souls of Men into the Hands of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> we alſo having ſeen him all-ſufficient for this Work, muſt <hi>commit our Souls into his Hand,</hi> as one <hi>able to keep what we commit to him until the laſt Day</hi>: We muſt reſign ourſelves unto him, as a glorious Undertaker for our Salvation: We muſt receive him, or be willing to ſubmit to him, in all his appointed Offices of Prophet, Prieſt, King, Example, Head of Influence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that we may receive from him every thing that we ſtand in need of, in order to our being brought home to God in Heaven. We muſt truſt in him as a <hi>Prince and Saviour, exalted to give Repentance</hi> to Sinners, <hi>and Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Sins.</hi> We muſt truſt in him as the great <hi>Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation for our Sins,</hi> our <hi>Peace-Maker,</hi> and the Procurer of our Pardon; we muſt live upon him as our <hi>Head</hi> of vital Influence, to change our ſinful Natures, and to work the Principles of all Grace in us by his Holy Spirit, and to preſerve them in oppoſition to all our Corruptions: We muſt depend on what he hath done and ſuffer'd for us, as the ground of our Acceptance
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:006440_0179_1028F0DFF0DC1E20"/>
with God, and we muſt ſeek to him to form our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſo far in the Likeneſs of God, as to fit us for Happineſs in the Enjoyment of God for ever. We muſt commit the important Affairs of our Souls to him, as one that is able to take care of them, and to carry them ſafely through all the Temptations and Dangers of the preſent Life; and we muſt truſt in him to receive our departing Spirits at Death, to raiſe our Bodies from the Duſt at the laſt Day, and to make our whole Natures completely holy and happy, in the Favour and Image of God for ever: All this belongs to his Commiſſion which he received from the Father.</p>
            <p>This is that great Act of <hi>Chriſtian Faith, Truſt, Hope or Dependance,</hi> which we are ſo often called to perform in the New Teſtament, which is foretold by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of old, and upon which our Salvation is ſo much repreſented to depend, in the Writings of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts and the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p n="8">8. If I were to add any thing to what has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid, it ſhould be this, (<hi>viz.</hi>) that as God the Father has appointed his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to be the great and <hi>general Medium</hi> of our Reſtoration and Return to his Favour, Image and Happineſs, ſo he has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed that in all our <hi>particular Addreſſes, and Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to himſelf, in a way of Prayer or Truſt, Thankſgiving or Praiſe, we ſhould make uſe of the Name</hi> of his Son <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as the only valuable and worthy Foundation for our Hope of Acceptance; that ſo <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the Son, as well as the Father, may be honour'd and glorified throughout the whole Courſe of our Religion in our way to Heaven.</p>
            <p>And ſince this is the conſtant Deſign, and the expreſs Appointment of the Father, 'tis neceſſary that we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply therewith, in all our Addreſſes to God: <hi>We muſt come unto the Father by him in every part of Worſhip:
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:006440_0180_1028F0E181EE7220"/>
By him we muſt believe,</hi> or truſt <hi>in God</hi>; we muſt <hi>pray to the Father in his Name,</hi> we muſt <hi>ask Forgiveneſs</hi> of our Sins <hi>for his Sake:</hi> It is by him we muſt offer up our Sacrifices of Thankſgiving and Praiſe; and by him we muſt preſent all our Services of Obedience, and <hi>whatſoever we do in Word or Deed,</hi> muſt be all <hi>in the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that we may be accepted of the Father, and that the Father may be glorified in his Son.</p>
            <p>This is the Appointment of the bleſſed God, and this muſt be our Practice till we come to the Fulneſs of this Salvation in Heaven, where we ſhall dwell for ever in the Preſence of God, and where we ſhall join with all the holy and happy Tribes of Mankind, of every Age and Nation, in aſcribing Bleſſing, and Honour, and Glory, and Praiſe, to him that ſits upon the Throne, as our reconciled God, and to the Lamb for ever, as our glorious and ſucceſsful Mediator. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
               <p>MAnkind by Nature lies under the Ruins of the Fall; both as <hi>Guilty</hi> and as <hi>Sinful.</hi> We are guilty in our <hi>Perſons,</hi> and expoſed to the divine Anger, as well as ſinful in our <hi>Natures,</hi> and ever ready to break his holy Law. Whoſoever therefore becomes our complete Saviour muſt relieve us under both theſe Diſtreſſes.</p>
               <p>As we are <hi>guilty</hi> in the Sight of God, we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the Court of his Law and Juſtice, we are liable to bear the Puniſhment due to our Sins, and we have loſt all Pretence of Right to the Favour of God and Eternal Life. Now our bleſſed Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who has undertaken the Work of our Salvation, is an all-ſufficient Saviour in every Reſpect; by his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Death and Interceſſion, he relieves us from the Guilt of Sin, and ſo delivers us from all Obligations to the Puniſhments of Hell: He reconciles us to God, and gives us a Right to Life and Salvation in the heavenly World.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="unknown:006440_0182_1028F0E59755B588"/>As we are <hi>ſinful</hi> Creatures we are ever ready to offend God afreſh, and are utterly unfit for his heavenly Preſence: And <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaves us in this Reſpect, by changing our vicious Nature and Temper, ſanctifying us by his Grace or Holy Spirit, ſo that we may be prepar'd for the Enjoyment of God in heavenly Places.</p>
               <p>In theſe two things the Subſtance of our Salvation chiefly conſiſts: And ſince theſe divine Affairs could not be ſo well underſtood by us, according to thoſe ſublime Ideas by which God the Father and his Son tranſact them in their Eternal Counſels and their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Diſpenſations, therefore God has been pleaſed to reveal them to us under ſuch Ideas or Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and in ſuch Forms of Language, as are borrow'd from our common Affairs in human Life; and that not only by <hi>one</hi> Figure or Emblem, but by many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations thereof, that we might view them on all Sides, and have a fuller Knowledge of them, ſo far as is ſufficient for our preſent State, or neceſſary to our Salvation.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Let us take a very brief Survey of this Matter, as our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> delivers us from our <hi>ſinful Natures,</hi> or the Power of Sin that works in us, for he is our <hi>Sanctification</hi> as well as our <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 30.</p>
               <p>Our bleſſed Saviour in this Reſpect, is ſometimes repreſented as our almighty <hi>Redeemer,</hi> who reſcues us from the Power of <hi>Satan,</hi> and of our own Luſts, by the more powerful Influences of his Spirit: He is our
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:006440_0183_1028F0EA16AA0468"/>
                  <hi>Sanctifier,</hi> who renews the Image of God in us, which was loſt by our firſt Apoſtacy, and this he does by his ſovereign creating Power, for we are <hi>created anew to good Works,</hi> in or by <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> He is ſometimes ſet forth as <hi>our Prophet,</hi> to give us Light and the Knowledge of God, and of the way of Salvation, by the divine Inſtructions of his Goſpel. He is our <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi> to go before us, and to mark out for us the Path of Duty and Holineſs by his own Footſteps, and to encourage our walking therein by his Precedency, and ſo he is alſo our <hi>Forerunner</hi> to Heaven. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is alſo our <hi>King</hi> to give us Laws and Rules of Life, and to rule in our Hearts by giving us an Inclination to obey his Laws: By his royal Power alſo in his exalted State, he ſubdues Sin in us, he mortifies our unruly Appetites and Paſſions which are his Enemies, he brings every Power of our Nature into Obedience and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to himſelf. He fits us for the heavenly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and actually beſtows upon us this final Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. He is alſo repreſented in Scripture as our <hi>Vital Head,</hi> or Head of ſpiritual Life, and Believers are his <hi>Members</hi>; and ſo his Spirit becomes the Spring of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Life in us, renews our ſinful Nature, raiſes us from Death in Treſpaſſes and Sins, conveys a new and divine Life to us, and will at laſt, by the ſame Spirit, raiſe our Bodies from the Dead to live forever with him.</p>

               <p>The other Branch of our Salvation is, that which I chiefly have in View at preſent, (<hi>viz.</hi>) that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the <hi>Deliverance of our Perſons from the Guilt of Sin, from Condemnation and Puniſhment,</hi> and in that <hi>Right to Eternal Life</hi> which is provided and given us by our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> There are many Repreſentations thereof in Scripture, borrow'd from the Affairs of Men; and the Characters which our bleſſed Lord ſuſtains, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Reſpects that our <hi>Faith</hi> and our <hi>Salvation</hi> bear to him, under theſe Characters, are chiefly ſuch as theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The firſt and moſt general Character which our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> aſſumes, is that of a <hi>Saviour,</hi> by which Name he is moſt frequently called in the New Teſtament. This is the very Signification of his proper Name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> Matt. i. 21. <hi>Thou ſhalt call his Name</hi> Jeſus, <hi>for he ſhall ſave his People from their Sins.</hi> He ſaves or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers us from Sin, and from all the painful or criminal Effects and Conſequences thereof: <hi>He delivers us from the Wrath to come,</hi> 1 Theſſ. i. <hi>ult.</hi> he ſaves us by withholding the divine Anger from us, and taking away every thing that provoked it, or might provoke it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Salvation</hi> is the natural Word to expreſs the Bleſſings we receive from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as he is our Saviour, <hi>i. e.</hi> Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Guilt of Sin and Puniſhment thereof, partly in this World, and chiefly in the World to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Faith</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">'Tis granted that the Word <hi>Faith in Chriſt,</hi> in its moſt ſtrict and proper Senſe, ſignifies a <hi>Truſt in him,</hi> according to the ſeveral Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries made of him in hte Goſpel: But if taken in its moſt large and general Senſe, as it implies the Addreſs or Application of a Sinner to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> for Salvation, it includes in it thoſe various Actions of the Soul which are Attendants on this <hi>Truſting,</hi> either with it, before it, or after it, as many Scriptures ſufficiently manifeſt.</note> gives us a ſpecial Intereſt in theſe Bleſſings, by

               <p n="2">II. the next Title which is given to our Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> on this Account, is a <hi>Mediator,</hi> to make Peace between an offended God and offending Man, 1 Tim. ii. 5. <hi>There is one God and one Mediator between God and Man, even the Man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> He is that <hi>Days-Man</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Chap.</hi> ix. 33. that great <hi>Reconciler,</hi> that Umpire or Perſon who <hi>can argue for us</hi> with the bleſſed God, who is able to <hi>lay his Hand upon both,</hi> to come between God and Man, and to remove this dreadful difference betwixt them. And this he did by all thoſe Methods which God has appointed in the Covenant of Redemption made with his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, i. e.</hi> by his Incarnation, his Obedience, his Sufferings, his Death, his Interceſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our <hi>Salvation</hi> under this Character is called <hi>Peace,</hi> Rom. v. 1. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf, for this Reaſon, is called <hi>our Peace</hi> or <hi>Peace-maker,</hi> Eph. ii. 24. and Iſai. xxvii. 5. where a Sinner is repreſented as <hi>taking hold of the Strength or Arm of the Lord,</hi> in order <hi>to make Peace with him.</hi> It is called <hi>Reconciliation to God,</hi> 2 Cor. v. 18. and the Goſpel is called the <hi>Word of Reconciliation</hi>: And let it be obſerved, that our <hi>Mediator</hi> not only takes away the

Difference between God and Man, but has alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſo far as to obtain an Intereſt in the Love and Favour of God forever, inſtead of his former Wrath, and Diſpleaſure, and Condemnation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Faith</hi> applies this Salvation to us, or ſecures to us an Intereſt therein, by our humble Acceptance of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> for ſuch a <hi>Mediator</hi> as God has propoſed him in his Word. Now this Acceptance of him as our Mediator, implies in it an earneſt Deſire of <hi>Reconciliation to God by him,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> beſeeches the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to be willing to be reconciled: It is an inward and hearty Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what <hi>Chriſt</hi> has done, and what he does for our Reconciliation in his mediatorial Offices, attended with ſincere Repentance for paſt Offences, and a Submiſſion to God for Time to come, which is neceſſarily, and in the very Nature of Things required of all that would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God, by the Mediation of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>

               </p>

               <p>Our <hi>Faith</hi> is called <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Truſt in his Blood as our Propitiation,</hi> Rom. iii. 24. It is a Dependance on the
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:006440_0188_1028F0F625600228"/>
Virtue and Efficacy of this Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for the procuring our Pardon: It is a ſort of <hi>Confeſſion of our Sins over the Head of the Sacrifice</hi> which was an ancient Ceremony in the Levitical <hi>Law,</hi> ſometimes performed by the Offender, and ſometimes by the Prieſt, whereby Sins were transferred to the Sacrifice who was to ſuffer for them, either by being ſlain, or by being ſent into the Land of Separation and Deſtruction, <hi>Lev.</hi> i. 4. and iii. 13. and v. 6. and xvi. 21. It is as it were a putting our guilty Souls under the ſprinkling of this atoning Blood, that we may be cleanſed from every Defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and it doth, as it were, preſent to God the Father, that Blood on which our Hope is placed.</p>
               <p n="5">V. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is yet farther repreſented to us as an <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate,</hi> which Idea is a very different thing from his Interceſſion as a <hi>High-Prieſt.</hi> 1 John ii. 2. <hi>If any Man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous.</hi> The proper Deſign of an <hi>High-Prieſt</hi> is to tranſact Affairs between God and Man, for Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation and Divine Favour, &amp;c. An <hi>Advocate</hi> is a Perſon appointed and choſen to plead before a Court of Juſtice againſt a Charge or Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and by his Pleading to bring off his Client with Honour, or to defend one who is charged with a Crime, from the Condemnation and Death which might be due to it. So our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, pleads againſt the Charges which the Law of God, or which <hi>Satan,</hi> our Adverſary, may bring againſt us; not by pretending that we are not guilty, but by pleading the Atonement made by his Blood for our Sins, by pleading our Pardon in the Court of Heaven, and by pleading his own Righteouſneſs, as the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Hope; and therefore as the Apoſtle in this very Text calls him <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous,</hi> in Rev. xii. 10, 11. <hi>Satan</hi> is repreſented as <hi>accuſing the Saints Day and Night before God. Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is their Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,

repreſenting his own Blood, and in this Senſe they are ſaid to <hi>caſt down the Accuſer by the Blood of the Lamb,</hi> which pleads and <hi>ſpeaks better Things than the Blood of Abel. i. e.</hi> it pleads for Mercy, whereas the Blood of <hi>Abel</hi> pleaded for Vengeance.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Salvation,</hi> in this Senſe, is called <hi>Freedom from Guilt,</hi> Abſolution or Acquitment from the Penalty, and a Vindication of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> from the Charge of Sin, and the Condemnation thereof, which is obtained by the prevailing Power and Intereſt which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> our Advocate has at the Court of Heaven, and by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting before the Throne of God our Pardon pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by his Blood, ſo that <hi>Satan</hi> has no further Charge againſt us.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Faith</hi> we commit our Caſe and Circumſtances to this great <hi>Advocate,</hi> and we become his <hi>Clients,</hi> Dependants upon him; and in this Senſe <hi>Faith</hi> may be ſaid to <hi>caſt down our Accuſer by the Blood of the Lamb,</hi> by truſting in this great and bleſſed Advocate, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning the important Concerns of our Souls to his Care and Faithfulneſs, to be tranſacted by him before the Bar of God in Heaven.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is ſet forth as our <hi>Sponſor</hi> or <hi>Surety,</hi> Heb. vii. 22. <hi>Jeſus</hi> was <hi>made a Surety of a better Teſtament, i. e.</hi> the new Covenant of Grace, as manifeſted in the Goſpel. A <hi>Surety</hi> is properly one, who undertakes for another to do or ſuffer ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for him, or who undertakes that this other Perſon ſhall do ſuch Services, or ſuffer ſuch Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, or enjoy ſuch Privileges. So our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> has undertaken to anſwer the Demands of the Law of God for us who had broken it, to pay a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation for our Violations of the Law, and to make Peace betwixt God and us. He has alſo undertaken, that all his People ſhall be ſanctified and brought ſafely to the heavenly World. So <hi>Judah</hi> became a
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:006440_0190_1028F0FCEEB1B088"/>
Surety to his Father <hi>Jacob</hi> for his Brother <hi>Benjamin,</hi> whom he took with him into <hi>Egypt.</hi> Gen. xliii. 9. <hi>I will be Surety for him; of mine Hands ſhalt thou require him. Reuben</hi> in the foregoing Chapter was in like manner a <hi>Sponſor</hi> for him, <hi>v.</hi> 37. <hi>Deliver him into my Hands, and I will bring him to thee again:</hi> and <hi>Joſeph</hi> bound <hi>Simeon</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> as a <hi>Surety</hi> for the Return of his Brethren, and <hi>Benjamin</hi> with them, <hi>v.</hi> 19, 36.</p>
               <p>Now as <hi>Chriſt</hi> was our <hi>Surety,</hi> ſo our <hi>Salvation</hi> may be called a Freedom from our Obligation to the Penal Law of God, which our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> took upon himſelf to anſwer, Rom. vii. 6. <hi>We are deliver'd from the Law, that being dead wherein we were held</hi>: Gal. iii. 13. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us,</hi> or freed us <hi>from the Curſe of the Law, being made a Curſe for us.</hi> Nor is this Obligation of <hi>Chriſt</hi> as a <hi>Sponſor,</hi> quite fulfilled till he has brought us all to Heaven, and can ſay to his Father, <hi>Lord, here am I, and the Children which thou haſt given me,</hi> as Heb. ii. 13. and ſhall <hi>preſent us before</hi> the Throne <hi>without Spot or Blemiſh,</hi> Jude 24, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Epheſ. v. 25, 26, 27.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Faith</hi> gives us an Intereſt in all that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> has done as our <hi>Sponſor</hi> by truſting ourſelves with him intirely under that Character, and accepting him as the <hi>Surety</hi> of this everlaſting Covenant.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is exhibited in Scripture as the <hi>ſecond Adam,</hi> as a <hi>common Head</hi> of his People, as a <hi>publick Perſon,</hi> and their <hi>Repreſentative.</hi> This has ſome Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in it from the former Character, though in many reſpects they agree and coincide. <hi>Adam</hi> was the Head of all his Offspring, a <hi>common Perſon</hi> and <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative</hi> for them, but not ſo properly their <hi>Surety</hi> in every Senſe. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is what <hi>Adam</hi> was, <hi>Rom.</hi> v. 14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 47. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not a common Perſon or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative in his <hi>Interceſſion</hi> or his <hi>Advocateſhip,</hi> tho' he is properly a <hi>Surety</hi> therein, for he has undertaken
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:006440_0191_1028F0FF763DF4B0"/>
as a Surety for us, to Plead in the Court of Heaven, and to bring us off with Safety and Honour: But in his <hi>Obedience,</hi> in his <hi>Death,</hi> and his <hi>Appearance</hi> for us in Heaven, he is our <hi>common Head</hi> and <hi>Repreſentative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our <hi>Salvation</hi> in this Senſe, may be called <hi>the Glory of God.</hi> Rom. v. 2. <hi>We rejoice in hope of the Glory of God:</hi> And it may be called <hi>Eternal Life.</hi> Both theſe deſcribe the Happineſs which was promiſed to Man upon his perfect Obedience to the Law at firſt. <hi>Rom.</hi> ii. 10. and iii. 23. By Sin <hi>we are fallen ſhort of the Glory of God</hi>; but we obtain by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt Salvation with eternal Glory.</hi> In this Senſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> is our <hi>Forerunner into Heaven,</hi> and he, as our public Repreſentative, appears there for us, and has taken up Places or Manſions in our Name, <hi>Heb.</hi> vi. laſt. We ſhall <hi>ſit on his Thrones. Rev.</hi> iii. 21. 'Tis alſo called an <hi>Inheritance,</hi> and we are <hi>Heirs of God and joint Heirs with Chriſt,</hi> Rom. viii. 17. as we are one with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Faith</hi> accepts of <hi>Chriſt</hi> as our <hi>common Head,</hi> or great <hi>Repreſentative,</hi> and gives us an Intereſt in this Salvation, by uniting us to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and making us one with him. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the Original Son of God, and we are alſo the <hi>Sons of God by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Gal. iii. 26. and thus we are <hi>Coheirs with Chriſt,</hi> he as the Head, and we as the Members; and <hi>Faith ſaves</hi> us as it has been called the <hi>Bond of Union</hi> between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and us. When we become Believers in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whatever was done to <hi>Chriſt</hi> as a Head or a common Perſon, is then applied to us, either in the Right to it, or in the Poſſeſſion of it. <hi>Chriſt</hi> was juſtified from Sin, <hi>i. e.</hi> from all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Sin, at his Reſurrection, and when we become the Seed of <hi>Chriſt</hi> by Regeneration through Faith, we are juſtified in him, much in the ſame manner as we were condemned in <hi>Adam, i. e.</hi> as ſoon as we become the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> by a natural Birth: As there is no new actual and particular Sentence of Condemnation
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:006440_0192_1028F10105A1B238"/>
paſt upon us at our Birth, but we fall under the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Condemnation, when we become the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi>; ſo there is no new Act of Juſtification paſſed by God upon the Creature at his Regeneration or Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, but the Word of God, which is his Sentence, pronounces us juſtified at our Faith, or our New Birth; and our Condemnation is taken away as ſoon as we are in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Rom. viii. 1. <hi>There is no Condemnation now to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Another Character which <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſuſtains, is that of a <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and it is generally repreſented, both in the Scripture and by our Divines, as one who redeems us both <hi>by Power</hi> and <hi>by Price.</hi> Now the <hi>Redemption</hi> of us by his <hi>powerful</hi> Grace out of the Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of <hi>Satan,</hi> and our own Luſts, and our Reſcue from the Temptations of this World, belong rather to the other Part of this Salvation, wherein his ſanctifying Influences are neceſſary and requiſite: But when <hi>Chriſt</hi> is conſidered as a <hi>Redeemer by Price,</hi> he frees us by the Price of his own Blood as a Ranſom, chiefly from the Hands of the vindictive Juſtice of God, and from the Bonds of the Guilt of Sin and Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby we are held as Breakers of the Law of God. Yet our <hi>Redemption</hi> from the Slavery of Sin and <hi>Satan</hi> may be alſo attributed to the Blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> which purchaſed ſanctifying Grace for us. The Name of a Redeemer is very applicable to both Parts of our Salvation. So he gave his Life a Ranſom <hi>for many.</hi> Matth. xx. 28. <hi>He redeemed us from the Curſe of the law, by being made a Curſe for us,</hi> Gal. iii. 13. <hi>He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us alſo by his precious Blood as of a Lamb without Blemiſh or Spot from our vain Converſation or Slavery to Sin,</hi> 1 Pet. i. 18, 19. and <hi>Thou art worthy, for thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ſt ſlain, and haſt redeemed us to God by thy Blood,</hi> Rev. v. 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="unknown:006440_0193_1028F102921E4288"/>
                  <hi>Salvation</hi> in this Reſpect is called <hi>Redemption,</hi> Rom. iii. 24. <hi>Eternal Redemption,</hi> Heb. ix. 12. and we are ſaid to be <hi>bought with a Price,</hi> 1 Cor. vi. 20. <hi>and therefore we are the Lord's and not our own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Faith</hi> applies this Benefit to us by our accepting the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> under this Character as a <hi>Redeems</hi> of our Perſons from this Condemnation, or as our great Friend who ranſom'd our Souls from Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under the Bonds of the condemning Law and Juſtice of God, who purchaſed and ranſomed us from our Captivity, Bonds and Miſeries in every Senſe.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. To ſum up all other Characters, I add in the laſt Place, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is repreſented as our great <hi>Friend</hi> and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor,</hi> one who came down from Heaven to ſeek and to ſave loſt Sinners here on Earth: He made a viſit to our World to take ſpecial Notice of all our Wants, in order to relieve them all, and to do, and to procure for us whatſoever we ſtood in need of, in order to our Eternal Happineſs. Under this Character he firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed or taught us the Doctrine of our loſt Eſtate, and acquainted us with the Methods of his Salvation; he procured or purchaſed for us, by his Death, not only pardon of Sin and future Bleſſedneſs, but every Grace and every Bleſſing which was neceſſary, in order to our full Poſſeſſion of Heaven, and no <hi>greater Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> can any Man ſhew to another, than to <hi>lay down his Life for him,</hi> John xv. 13.</p>
               <p>Under this View <hi>Salvation</hi> or <hi>Eternal Life</hi> is called the <hi>Gift of God by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. vi. 23. <hi>Abundance of Grace and the Gift of Righteouſneſs</hi> in order <hi>to reign in Life,</hi> Rom. v. 17. He bought again for us our forfeited Inheritance in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Obſerve this Notion of <hi>Chriſt</hi> as a <hi>Benefactor</hi> reſpects his doing every Kindneſs, and procuring or purchaſing every <hi>Bleſſing</hi> for us, and beſtowing it upon us; whereas in the Character of a <hi>Redeemer</hi> he bought
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:006440_0194_1028F106E998C5F0"/>
or purchaſed our <hi>Perſons</hi> from Impriſonment and Condemnation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Faith</hi> gives us an Intereſt in theſe Bleſſings of <hi>Chriſt</hi> as a <hi>Benefactor,</hi> when it comes to him, and ſeeks them at his Hand, when it humbly depends upon <hi>Chriſt</hi> for them, and truſts in him to beſtow them. Thus our <hi>Faith</hi> is like a Hand, whereby we receive theſe Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings which <hi>Chriſt</hi> has to beſtow, or like the Feet where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we <hi>come</hi> or <hi>fly</hi> to <hi>Chriſt</hi> to partake of them; or it may be liken'd to the <hi>Voice of Petition,</hi> whereby we ſeek them at his Hands, and <hi>call upon the Lord</hi> to beſtow them.</p>
               <p>Thus I have briefly run through many of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Characters or Offices, whereby our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is repreſented to us, whereby our <hi>Salvation</hi> is ſet forth, and whereby our <hi>Faith</hi> is deſcribed as the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Means of our Intereſt in them. 'Tis evident enough they often run into one another, nor did the Goſpel ever deſign that theſe ſeveral Repreſentations of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of his <hi>Salvation</hi> and of our <hi>Faith,</hi> ſhould be kept ſo ſeparate by exact <hi>logical</hi> Forms of Expreſſion, as to pleaſe Scholaſtic Readers only; but that plain ſincere Souls under a Senſe of Guilt and Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, might ſee and view them on every Side, and might find ſomething in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſuited to their Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their own Wants and Miſeries, and apply themſelves to him for Relief; but this ſhall be the Subject of the next <hi>Section.</hi>

                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. That thoſe Attributes of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>viz.</hi> his Wiſdom, his Power, his Juſtice, his Mercy, his Faithfulneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which could not have ſo full an Illuſtration one way, or under one Expreſſion or Metaphor, might have another.

               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2. That our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> might be the better known by us, and the more endeared to us, by ſuſtaining theſe various Offices and Relations; and that we might be able to borrow ſome further Ideas, and ſome clearer Knowledge of theſe divine and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant things of our Salvation, from many of the common Affairs and Occurrences of Life. When the bleſſed God has taken ſo much care to provide ſuch a Saviour for us, and ſuch as illuſtrious Salvation, he is very deſirous that we ſhould view it on all Sides, and be more thoroughly acquainted with it, as well as with that bleſſed Perſon by whom he prepares and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows it.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 3. That all ſorts of Perſons, of whatſoever Temper or Capacity, whatſoever Want or Difficulty, they are in, might have wherewith to ſuit them and their Circumſtances; that every Son and Daughter of <hi>Adam,</hi> in their various Ranks of Life, might all learn the way to receive this Saviour, and lay hold on this Salvation of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and that he might render it eaſy and familiar to us by ſo many common Similitudes, or Parallels drawn from the things of common Life: And thus thoſe who know not how to apply themſelves to <hi>Chriſt</hi> one way, might do it another.</p>
               <p>As for Inſtance, ſome poor feeble Creatures who are convinced of Sin, and ready to periſh, perhaps may not know how to apply or addreſs themſelves to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as a <hi>Surety</hi> or as a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> or as a <hi>Redeemer,</hi> &amp;c. for theſe things are done already, and in a great meaſure were finiſhed long ago; but the meaneſt and pooreſt Creatures can eaſily learn how to apply to <hi>Chriſt</hi> as a <hi>Mediator,</hi> to do ſomething for them that is yet to be done, to reconcile them to God, and to bring them into his Preſence with Comfort; or as an <hi>High Prieſt of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion,</hi> or as an <hi>Advocate</hi> to plead for them before the Throne of God, and their Faith can wait on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> can call upon him, and truſt in him to make <hi>Interceſſion</hi> for them in the Virtue of his Blood, or to preſent his Blood before the Father as an Atonement for their Sins, to appear before God for them as their great Friend in Heaven, to become their <hi>Mediator, Peace-maker</hi> or <hi>Reconciler,</hi> to bring them into the Favour of God.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 4. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſet forth under theſe various Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, that as our Underſtanding in the Things of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and in the Graces and Glories of <hi>Chriſt</hi> increaſes, we might take the faſter hold of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> if I might ſo expreſs it, and that we might have more various Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of our Faith, and more numerous Evidences of the Truth of our Faith, and ſecure to ourſelves more ſolid ground of Hope, when we can view him in all theſe Relations, and our <hi>Faith</hi> can receive or lay hold of him under all theſe Forms. Thus we may hereby obtain double and treble Confirmation of our Faith and Comfort, <hi>Heb.</hi> vi. 17, 18. God gives us both his <hi>Promiſe</hi> and his <hi>Oath,</hi> to ſecure Salvation to us; he <hi>ſwears,</hi> in order to confirm what he had <hi>promiſed, that by</hi> ſeveral <hi>immutable things, in which it is impoſſible for God to lie, we might have ſtrong Conſolation, who have fled to lay hold of the Hope ſet before us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus has God been pleaſed alſo to do in the various Repreſentations he has made of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> our Saviour, that our Meditations and Prayers, our Hopes and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendencies, and indeed all the pious Exerciſes of our Souls towards <hi>Chriſt,</hi> might have a rich Variety for our Entertainment, Support and Joy; and therefore the Apoſtles have written theſe things unto the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of <hi>Chriſt, that their Joy might be full.</hi> 1 John i. 4.</p>
               <p>I add 5thly, another <hi>Reaſon</hi> is, that God our Father and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> out Saviour might have the larger

Revenues of Glory from us, and receive Honour from our Hands in a rich Variety; that we might have our Thank-Offerings riſing up to God and the Lamb, in many Forms of Adoration and Expreſſion; that we might bleſs our dear Redeemer, rejoice in him, and do Honour to his Name under all thoſe happy Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of his Grace and Glory, in which he has ſet himſelf before us in the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>The laſt <hi>Reaſon</hi> I will add, ſhall be this: That in all Ages the Followers of <hi>Chriſt</hi> might have a more clear and eaſy Relief, from thoſe Difficulties and Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies which may attend theſe great Doctrines of our Salvation, and which might darken and perplex the Way whereby God has appointed us to be made Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of this Bleſſing.</p>

                  <hi>SECT. IV.</hi> The Difficulties which are relieved by this various Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Salvation of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Since God has ſet forth our bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi> with his <hi>Salvation,</hi> and our <hi>Faith</hi> which intereſts us therein, under ſo many various Characters and Expreſſions, the following Difficulties will be very much relieved hereby, and ſeveral Controverſies aboliſhed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A Chriſtian who reads theſe things in his Bible, cannot ſay that <hi>Chriſt</hi> has ſaved us in this particular manner, and therefore he did not ſave us in the other; as for Inſtance,</p>
               <p>When we read or aſſert that <hi>Chriſt was put to Death</hi> for us, as <hi>a Sacrifice for our Sins,</hi> we cannot ſay, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>he did not ſave us as a High Prieſt:</hi> Or when we read or aſſert that he ſaved us <hi>as our High-Prieſt,</hi> we cannot ſay, therefore <hi>he was not a Sacrifice</hi>; for the Scriptures aſſure us, <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf is both the <hi>High-Prieſt</hi>
                  <pb n="184" facs="unknown:006440_0199_1028F14CC0B28EF0"/>
and the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> alſo, Eph. v. 2. <hi>Chriſt hath given himſelf for us as an Offering and Sacrifice to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again,</hi> One Chriſtian will perhaps be ready to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaves us as a great <hi>Friend</hi> and <hi>Benefactor,</hi> who has, by the Price of his Blood, purchaſed the <hi>Bleſſings</hi> of Grace and Glory for us, and beſtows them upon us; another may chuſe to fix his Eye more upon <hi>Chriſt</hi> as a <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and ſay he has bought or purchaſed our <hi>Perſons</hi> from the Hands of divine Juſtice, or he has redeemed us from the Curſe of the Law, and from the Bonds wherein we, as Criminals, were held by the Law of God: But neither of them ſhould dare to ſay, <hi>he bought or purchaſed theſe Bleſſings</hi> for us, and therefore <hi>he did not purchaſe our Perſons</hi>; for he has done both theſe under different Characters.</p>
               <p>Yet further, one Chriſtian may delight more to fix his Eye and Hope on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as a <hi>Surety</hi> or <hi>Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> of his Elect, or of thoſe whom he certainly and finally ſaves, and on that account he ſuffered Death particularly <hi>in their room and ſtead,</hi> and ſecured to them certain Deliverance and Salvation; yet he cannot therefore affirm, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not, in any Senſe, die for all Men, as a general Friend of Man, or ſuffer Death <hi>for their Good;</hi> nor can he ſay, that the Benefits of his Death do not any way reach to all Mankind. Another perhaps will ſay, <hi>ſince all are dead, he died for all</hi> as a <hi>common Mediator</hi> betwixt God and Man, or as a <hi>general Benefactor</hi> to procure <hi>conditional</hi> Salvation for all Men, and offer it to them if they are willing to come to him and receive it; but he cannot ſay, that he was not a <hi>proper Surety,</hi> or <hi>Repreſentative</hi> of his Elect, vhereby he has <hi>ſecured certain</hi> Salvation to them only: For as I have ſhewn in former Papers, that he by his Righteouſneſs and Death has directly and <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely</hi> procured this Salvation for his Elect, as their <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Repreſentative,</hi> but yet he has alſo
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:006440_0200_1028F113E3F093A8"/>
procured Salvation, with all the Glories of it, <hi>conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally,</hi> for the reſt of Mankind, upon which Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion theſe Bleſſings are offer'd to all Men in the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is another ſort of Difficulty from which theſe various Repreſentations of the Salvation of <hi>Chriſt</hi> may deliver and relieve us, (<hi>viz.</hi>) The Actions or the Sufferings of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> have not preciſely the ſame Relation, Character or Effect, with regard to one of his Offices, as they have with regard to another; and therefore what is pronounced ſafely, with regard to the <hi>Death of Chriſt</hi> under one Character, cannot be with Safety pronounced concerning it under another. As for Example,</p>
               <p>When ſo glorious and illuſtrious a Perſon as <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> appears as our <hi>Friend</hi> and <hi>Benefactor,</hi> he paid ſo ſublime a Price by his Death and Sufferings, as in a ſtrict Senſe to ſatisfy or make full Recompence for all our Violations of the Law of God, and to merit Pardon and Eternal Life at the Hand of God for us: But when we conſider him merely as our <hi>Repreſentative,</hi> or our <hi>Surety,</hi> and to anſwer what the Law demanded of us, he cannot be ſo properly ſaid to merit our Pardon, or to make full and abundant Recompence to the Juſtice of God for our Offences; for this might lead or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Perſons to infer, that we ourſelves have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied God, or made Recompence to him in the Perſon of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or that we have merited our Pardon and our Salvation, becauſe what he did intirely as our <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative,</hi> we may in ſome ſort be eſteemed to have done in and by him.</p>
               <p>Again, the Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> as a <hi>Surety</hi> and the <hi>ſecond Adam</hi> was his ſuffering of the Curſe of the Law, and the Penalty thereof in our ſtead, which we had incurred; and in this View his Death and his Dereliction, or being forſaken of the Father, was the <hi>Idem,</hi> or Same, which
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:006440_0201_1028F116C0D26F18"/>
Sinners ſhould have ſuffer'd; tho' in other Reſpects, and when we conſider him as a glorious <hi>Mediator,</hi> or ſuper-eminent <hi>Benefactor,</hi> then he appears with all the Dignity of his indwelling Godhead, and in this Senſe he paid a Price of ſuperior Value, his Death is the <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tundem</hi>; and more, he makes an abundant Compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Sin, and a Satisfaction to the Demands of the Law, and honours the Juſtice of God more than our everlaſting Puniſhment could do, and hereby he merits for us thoſe Bleſſings which are above all our Reach, or Pretences, or Obligations to procure or merit for ourſelves.</p>
               <p>Again, as he was a <hi>Redeemer,</hi> his Death is a <hi>Price paid for our Souls</hi> to Divine Juſtice, in order to releaſe us from the Bonds of Condemnation: But his Death as a <hi>Benefactor,</hi> may be rather conſider'd as a <hi>Price for the Bleſſings</hi> which he purchaſed for us, and of which we are made Partakers thro' him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There are other Difficulties which are ſtarted among the ſeveral Controverſies of Chriſtians with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to our <hi>Faith,</hi> and the way and manner whereby this <hi>Faith</hi> intereſts us in <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Salvation: And ſince <hi>Chriſt</hi> has ſuſtained ſo many Characters and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and ſtands in ſo many Relations to us, our <hi>Faith</hi> is exerciſed towards him in a Correſpondency to each of theſe Relations and Characters; and therefore when we read or aſſert that our <hi>Faith</hi> ſaves us in this way, or under this <hi>Logical</hi> Relation, we dare not therefore aſſert, that it cannot ſave us in any other way, or under another <hi>Logical</hi> Relation. I would endeavour to make this thing a little more clear, becauſe there have many Controverſies ariſen upon this Head.</p>
               <p>Let us then briefly recollect or take a ſhort Survey of the ſeveral Repreſentations which are given us of <hi>Faith in Chriſt,</hi> according to theſe different Characters of our bleſſed Saviour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="unknown:006440_0202_1028F1184D47DB48"/>
                  <hi>Faith</hi> in its moſt general Senſe, Nature and Deſign, as it refers to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is the Application or Addreſs of the Soul to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or to God by him, under any or all theſe Characters, whereby he and his Salvation are ſet forth in Scripture. Now theſe Characters being ſo very different and various, require different manners of Addreſs to him, which are repreſented in Scripture, which perhaps may be all included in <hi>Faith</hi> taken in its largeſt Senſe, together with thoſe neceſſary Acts of the Soul which muſt accompany, attend, or follow it.</p>
               <p>Particularly then <hi>Faith</hi> is ſometimes repreſented by believing his Goſpel, Mark i. 15. <hi>Repent and believe the Goſpel:</hi> But here it is to be ſuppoſed, that all the proper and ſanctifying Effects of this Faith muſt attend it, and it muſt not reſt in a mere Aſſent.</p>
               <p>'Tis a Knowledge of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> John xvii. 3. <hi>This is Life Eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> Iſai. liii. 11. <hi>By his Knowledge,</hi> or the Knowledge of him, <hi>ſhall he juſtify many</hi>: And here I might add, that this our Knowledge requires a correſpondent Practice, otherwiſe it will be of no more avail towards Salvation, than the Knowledge of <hi>Devils, who believe and tremble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis a Believing in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which perhaps ought rather to be render'd <hi>Truſting in Chriſt.</hi> Iſai. ii. 10. compar'd with Rom. xv. 12. <hi>In him ſhall the Gentiles truſt,</hi> 2 Tim. i. 12. <hi>I know whom I have believed, or truſted,</hi> Eph. i. 12, 13. <hi>who firſt truſted in Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>hoped in him,</hi> as in the Original.</p>
               <p>Believing in his Name, John i. 12. <hi>To them gave he Power to become the Sons of God, even to as many as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved on his Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seeking to him, Iſai. xi. 10. <hi>To him ſhall the Gentiles ſeek.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Receiving <hi>Chriſt,</hi> John i. 12. <hi>To as many as received
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:006440_0203_1028F11D9D086750"/>
him,</hi> &amp;c. Coloſſ. ii. 6. <hi>As you have received</hi> Chriſt, <hi>ſo walk in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laying hold of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Iſai. xxvii. 5. <hi>Let him take hold of my Strength that he may make Peace with me.</hi> Heb. vi. 18. <hi>Thoſe who have fled for Refuge to lay hold of the Hope ſet before them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hearing of <hi>Chriſt</hi> or hearkening to him, Luke ix. 35. <hi>This is my beloved Son, hear ye him,</hi> or <hi>hearken unto him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Calling upon <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Rom. x. 12, 13. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall call on the Name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Coming unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Matt. xi. 28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that Labour,</hi> &amp;c. John v. 40. <hi>Ye will not come unto me that ye may have Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Flying to him for Refuge, <hi>Heb.</hi> vi. 18. as before.</p>
               <p>Looking unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or beholding him, Iſai. xiv. 25. <hi>Look unto me all ye Ends of the Earth and be ſaved.</hi> Iſai. lxv. 1. <hi>I ſaid, behold me, behold me, to a Nation not called by my Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obeying <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Heb. v. 9. <hi>He became the Author of Eternal Salvation to them that obey him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Believing in God through <hi>Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. i. 21. <hi>Who by him do believe in God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Coming to God by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> John xiv. 6. <hi>No Man cometh to the Father but by me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſee <hi>Faith,</hi> together with its various Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitants, or conſequent Exerciſes of Soul, is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as our Addreſs or Application to <hi>Chriſt</hi> for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by and with almoſt all the Senſes or Powers of Nature: 'Tis looking to him with the <hi>Eye,</hi> 'tis hearken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him with the <hi>Ear,</hi> 'tis receiving or laying hold of him with the <hi>Hand,</hi> 'tis coming to him with the <hi>Feet,</hi> 'tis Knowledge of him in the <hi>Head,</hi> truſt in him with the <hi>Heart,</hi> calling upon him with the <hi>Tongue,</hi> and obeying him with all the <hi>Powers of Soul and Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now 'tis well known, that there have been great Diſputes about the particular Influence which this <hi>Acts of
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:006440_0204_1028F1200C4EFC58"/>
Faith</hi> has, in order to intereſt us in the Salvation of <hi>Chriſt</hi>: And here I will readily grant, that the Word <hi>Faith</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily and chiefly implies ſuch a Knowledge of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſuch a Belief of his Goſpel, ſuch a Senſe of our Wants, and his Sufficiency to ſupply them, as leads the Soul to receive him under any of thoſe Characters in which the Goſpel ſets him forth, and more particularly to <hi>truſt in him</hi> for this Salvation<note n="*" place="bottom">It may be obſerved here, that almoſt every Character or Action, whereby <hi>Faith in Chriſt</hi> is repreſented in Scripture, carries in it the Notion of <hi>Truſt, Hope</hi> or <hi>Dependance,</hi> ſo that the original and moſt proper Senſe of the Word Faith is ſtill maintained, and every Sinner who ſincerely applies himſelf to <hi>Chriſt</hi> for Salvation, does certainly put forth an Act of <hi>Truſt</hi> or <hi>Hope</hi> in him, though he may not always ſo evidently and diſtinctly apprehend and judge of the inward Acts of his own Soul, or diſtinguiſh them ſo exactly.</note>: But there are many poor Souls who have learnt ſincerely to addreſs themſelves to our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> by one or two of theſe Characters and Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of <hi>Faith,</hi> but were never carried on ſo far as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely to make an Addreſs to <hi>Chriſt</hi> under all his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct Relations, or to perform every one of theſe Actions in their Addreſſes to <hi>Chriſt</hi>: And can I ſuppoſe where the Soul is very ſincere in its Deſires of the whole Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> both in the Holineſs and the Happineſs of it, and ſeeks it from him, that ſuch Souls ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, becauſe they have not well learnt all the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors and Figures under which theſe ſacred Things are exhibited in the Goſpel?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again,</hi> on the other hand, if one ſhould ſay, <hi>Faith</hi> ſaves us as it is an <hi>Eye</hi> to look to <hi>Chriſt</hi> that we may be ſaved, he cannot thence infer it does not ſave us as an <hi>Ear</hi> to hearken to him, as an <hi>Hand</hi> to lay hold of him, or as a <hi>Tongue</hi> to call upon him, or a <hi>Heart</hi> to truſt in him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again,</hi> if another ſhould ſay, <hi>Faith</hi> ſaves us as an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument</hi>
                  <pb n="190" facs="unknown:006440_0205_1028F121967F1820"/>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Perhaps there have been no greater Quarrels upon this Subject than amongſt thoſe who have maintain'd that <hi>Faith</hi> ſaves us as it is an <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> whereby we receive <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Righteouſneſs, and thoſe who aſſert it is a <hi>Condition</hi> upon which <hi>Chriſt</hi> has appointed us to be intereſted in his Bleſſings: And tho' I think they may both be true, according to the Repreſentation I have made in this and other of theſe <hi>Eſſays</hi>; yet we have no great Reaſon to be fond of either of theſe Terms, eſpecially when they are made a Matter of Controverſy, becauſe they are neither of them the Expreſſions of Scripture, which is our ſupreme Rule of Inſtruction in the Matters of our Salvation.</note> to receive <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his Righteouſneſs and Grace, he cannot argue that it does not ſave us, as it is a <hi>Condition,</hi> or a <hi>Term</hi> of our being accepted of God thro' him; or if another ſhould ſay, <hi>Faith</hi> ſaves us, as it is a <hi>laying hold</hi> of his Perſon, or as a <hi>Bond of Union</hi> between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and us, yet he cannot argue, therefore <hi>Faith</hi> does not ſave us, as it is a <hi>Looking</hi> or <hi>Seeking to him</hi> from afar off, or as it is a <hi>Calling upon</hi> the Name of the Lord.</p>
               <p>God has been pleaſed in many Ways to manifeſt theſe moſt important Things of our Salvation, and revealed them to us in a variety of human Expreſſions, Similitudes, Actions and Relations, that the pooreſt and the weakeſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> might have Support and Encouragement for his Hope.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concluſion:</hi> 'Tis confeſſed, that theſe Thoughts are not ſufficiently digeſted into perfect Form, nor put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all that Accuracy as Theological Controverſies require; but my Senſe and Meaning in them is pretty obvious and evident: Perhaps this Deſign might be more improved and promoted much farther by a wiſer Head, and a better Pen; and it might aſſiſt the Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many Difficulties, and relieve the Quarrels and Contentions of different Parties to a greater degree; for 'tis evident, that the Characters which our Bleſſed Lord ſuſtains, and the Exerciſes of our Faith on him are very various, and we are made Partakers of this Salvation,
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:006440_0206_1028F1237349BED8"/>
perhaps as many ways as our <hi>Acts of Faith</hi> bear different Reſpects to the ſeveral bleſſed <hi>Characters and Offices</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſuſtains, in order to our Salvation. Now, to him who has redeemed us by Power and by Price; to him who has ſaved us by his Blood and his Spirit; to him who has purchaſed our Souls from the Bondage of the Law, and from Death and Hell, and has pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for us the Bleſſings of Grace, the Pardon of our Sins, and an Inheritance in Heaven, be Glory and Honour in endleſs Varieties, and eternal Praiſes from all the Redeemed. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>CHARITY in the Soul of Man is the very Picture of the God-head, taken as it ſtands in the faireſt Light. Wiſdom and Holineſs, Power, Sovereignty and Juſtice are various Features of the Deity:
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:006440_0208_1028F12A9B8D5070"/>
They are indeed his very Nature and Eſſence; yet the Scripture rather chuſes to expreſs, that <hi>God is Love,</hi> and that twice in one Chapter, 1 <hi>John</hi> iv. 8, and 16. The beloved Diſciple that lean'd on the Boſom of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> took peculiar Delight in the Contemplation of God, under this Character. This appears in his Goſpel as well as in his Epiſtle. The other Glories of that infinite Beauty ſhine with awful Beams, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand my Reverence: But methinks, I love to look upon ſo glorious a Being in his moſt condeſcending Air, and to converſe with him in his mildeſt and moſt inviting Aſpect.</p>
               <p>Charity in Man is a Grace of that alluring Sweetneſs, that my Pen would fain be attempting to ſay ſomething in Favour of it: I find a ſtrange Pleaſure in diſcourſing of this Virtue, hoping that my very Soul may be moulded into its Divine Likeneſs. I would always feel i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> inwardly warming my Heart. I would have it look thro' my Eyes continually, and it ſhould be ever ready upon my Lips to ſoften every Expreſſion of my Tongue. I would dreſs my ſelf in it as my beſt Raiment, I would put it on upon my Faith and Hope, not ſo as entirely to hide them, but as an upper and more viſible Veſture, conſtantly to appear in among Men. For our <hi>Chriſtian Charity,</hi> is to evidence our other Virtues.</p>
               <p>Uncharitableneſs is a loathſom Part of the Image of the fallen Angel: It is akin to the Hatred of God. <hi>For he that loveth not his Brother whom he hath ſeen, how can he love God whom he has not ſeen?</hi> 1 John iv. 20. He that hates his Fellow-Chriſtian, and brings railing Accuſations againſt him for a Difference in little Qpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, how can he expect to be beloved of God, who beholds in the beſt of us ſo many monſtrous Follies, and Guilt of a more aggravated Nature? By the Word <hi>Uncharitableneſs</hi> here, I would not include our Neglect
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:006440_0209_1028F12D6D1225A0"/>
of Charity to the Poor and Hungry, nor our Averſion to Errors of the groſſer kind, but I mean our Averſion to ſuch Perſons who not only profeſs to be <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but who alſo agree with us in the chief Doctrines of <hi>Chriſtianity, (viz.</hi>) the Pardon of our Sins by the aton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sacrifice of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the Sanctification of Men by the powerful Operations of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> and the Neceſſity of Faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and Good Works, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I mean our Averſion to thoſe who differ from us in little Punctilios of Doctrine or Duty which are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly and plainly written in the New Teſtament; thoſe who maintain ſuch an Averſion to their fellow Chriſtians, as to pronounce Damnation upon them, or ſome terrible and unchriſtian Cenſures, becauſe they do not come up to our Sentiments and Practices in things which are of little Moment, while we agree in all fundamental Points, and ſuch as are of moſt Importance.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Uncharitableneſs</hi> is a Vice attended with ſuch a Train of Miſchiefs, that I would ſet all my biggeſt Powers in Array to fight againſt it. 'Tis a Fountain of ſuch bitter Waters, that I would fain damm up the Spring. 'Tis a Plant of ſo poiſonous a Product, that I would dig deep and ſearch for the Roots, and tear up all the Fibres of it, tho' they twined about my Heart-ſtrings.</p>

                  <hi>SECT. I.</hi> The Cauſes of Uncharitableneſs.</head>
               <p>An Uncharitable Humour ſprings generally from ſome of theſe following Cauſes.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>Firſt,</hi> From <hi>a malicious Conſtitution of Nature, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> acrimonious or a cholerick Temper of Blood.</hi> There are ſome Animal Engines of human Fleſh, that have their Juices all ſour'd in their very Formation; and there is
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:006440_0210_1028F12F24734C80"/>
an ill Ferment raiſed in ſuch Perſons at the Perception of every Object, that is not juſt ſuited to their preſent Fancy and Inclination: And by the hard Laws of Union between Soul and Body in this our fallen State, the Spirit too often complies with the fretful Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of the Fleſh. There are but few that attempt to ſuppreſs the Ferment, and to reſiſt the angry Motions of the Animal; and of thoſe few that attempt it, ſcarce one in ten is very ſucceſsful: For 'tis a Work of Toil, and Difficulty, perpetual Watchfulneſs and unceaſing Prayer.</p>
               <p>This ill Humour mixes itſelf with Religion, as well as with Civil Affairs. It diffuſes its Malignity thro' all the Studies and the Manners of the Man, and gives a viſible Tincture to his Notions and his Practices. <hi>Furio</hi> can never converſe about the calmeſt and moſt ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Points of Divinity, but his Indignation kindles againſt every different Opinion, his fiery Temper breaks out and blazes, and he beſtows on his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment the honourable Names of ſhining Light and burning Zeal. His peeviſh and angry Paſſions are ſo blended with his Underſtanding, that hard Names are his beſt Arguments; moſt convincing to himſelf, tho' they are the juſt Scorn of the wiſe. He ſtabs his Brethren that differ from him to the Heart, with pointed Railing; and from an Averſion to an Opinion riſes to an immortal Hatred of the Perſon. If our great Creator has untied any of our Souls to Bodies that are leſs infected with this vicious Juice, we have Reaſon to adore his Sovereign Goodneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Self-Love and Pride, and a vain Conceit of our own Opinions,</hi> is another Spring of uncharitable Carriages. Did you ever ſee a weak and humble Soul ſenſible of its own Poverty and Ignorance, and ready to eſteem others above himſelf, eaſily indulge this uncharitable Humour? Alas! poor fooliſh Mankind is very prone
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:006440_0211_1028F131AA99AF78"/>
to eſteem itſelf Wiſe and Knowing. Little <hi>Laudillus,</hi> who is almoſt always in the wrong, has much ado to perſwade himſelf, that he was ever capable of miſtaking. He ſecretly thinks all his Opinions to be divine Truths, and therefore he is very laviſh in pronouncing Error and Hereſy upon every Notion and Practice that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from his own. He takes the Freedom to chuſe a Religion for himſelf, but he allows no Man beſides the ſame Liberty. He is ſure that he has Reaſon to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from others, but no Man has Reaſon to diſſent from him. He ſets up for Infallibility without a Triple Crown, and fixes a See of Eccleſiaſtical Sovereignty on this Side the Water. He awes ſome ſlaviſh Spirits into Submiſſion, and they become treacherous to their own Souls and to the Rights of Human Nature, by delivering up their Faith and Conſciences to his impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Dictates: Then the Man grows haughty, ſurly and ſevere, eſpecially if he be advanced to any degree of Honour and Authority in the Church: Then in his inflexible Juſtice he delivers up the humble and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive Chriſtian unto <hi>Satan,</hi> becauſe he can't <hi>aſſent and conſent to all and every thing contain'd</hi> in his Scheme; and he teaches perhaps his elder Brethren the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines and Diſcipline of the Goſpel, as <hi>Gideon</hi> did the Elders of <hi>Succoth,</hi> with the Briars and Thorns of the Wilderneſs.</p>
               <p n="3">III. This hateful Vice may be derived from a third Original; and that is a <hi>conſtant and friendly Acquaintance with the Men and Books of our own Opinion,</hi> and <hi>an Avoidence of all the Writers and Perſons that differ from us:</hi> This has a mighty Influence to beget and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain uncharitable Notions; yet this is the conſtant Practice, not only of the unlearned, but of too many of the learned World. <hi>Hermes</hi> ſits all the Year in his own Cell, and never looks abroad beyond the Clan of his own Fraternity: <hi>Hermes</hi> reads the Controverſies
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:006440_0212_1028F135697CC210"/>
as they are deſcribed only by one Party, and diſputes them over only in the Books that are written on one Side. He finds a great Appearance of Argument and Scripture there, and then proclaims it impoſſible that the adverſe Party ſhould ſhew equal Reaſon or Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: And thus he proceeds to cenſure them as <hi>Men of corrupt Minds, reprobate concerning the Faith,</hi> and <hi>twiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures to their own Damnation. Cicero</hi> in his Treatiſe <hi>De natura Deorum,</hi> marks this Humour, and brands it, <hi>Veſtra ſolum legitis, veſtra amatis, caeteros cauſa incognita condemnatis</hi>

                     </gap> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn others before you know any ſufficient Reaſon, for want of knowing their Opinions.</note>.</p>
               <p>But let you and I, my Friend, who delight in Charity, let us converſe a little with Authors that differ from our preſent Opinions, and we ſhall ſee their Sentiments dreſt up ſo plauſibly, and ſet in ſo fair a Light, that might eaſily perſwade Men of ſincere Conſciences to embrace them; and this will prevent us from cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious Thoughts concerning our candid Adverſaries, and their Diſciples. There is ſcarce any thing that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larges the Mind more, and more diſengages it from narrow and ſelfiſh Principles, than a free Converſe with the Virtuous and Ingenious of all Parties.</p>
               <p>There is a memorable Story to this Purpoſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning two Neighbours in an unſociable Town, who were always quarrelling about the private Meeting and the Pariſh-Church: Both Places of Worſhip in that Town were well ſupplied with Preachers of good Senſe and ſerious Religion; but each of them was the Subject of unmerciful Reproach between theſe two Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, whenſoever they met, and their different Methods of Worſhip were mutually reviled; the one as formal and ſpiritleſs, the other as enthuſiaſtical and indecent: At laſt <hi>Pacifico</hi> their common Friend per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:006440_0213_1028F136F4D48D28"/>
them to hear each others Miniſter, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied them both one Day to their different Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies; and they were both ſurprized to hear the Goſpel preached with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> due Degree of Decency and Fervour, both at Meeting and at Church: And though they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſtill to adhere to their own Party, as judging it, in ſome Reſpects, ſuited beſt to their Edification; yet they maintained hearty Friendſhip with each other, and delightful Society in religious Conference: Thus the quarrelſom Miſtake was rectify'd by better Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance: They lived many Years together in Peace; they compos'd the Animoſities of different Parties, that dwelt in the Town; they died in perfect Charity, and left a ſweet Influence behind them, and an honourable Example.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. A <hi>Fourth</hi> Spring of Uncharitableneſs is, <hi>our read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word of God with a whole Set of Notions eſtabliſhed before-hand</hi>: And yet how common a Method, and how conſtant is this? <hi>Diaecion</hi> has long ago determined, that Biſhops muſt be ſuperior to Presbyters; he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Ordination from Epiſcopal Hands; and hopes one Day himſelf to be capable of ordaining others. Thus while he is growing up towards the Mitre, he reads the Scriptures only to confirm his own determin'd Opinions. He ſtretches and torments many an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing Text, to make it ſpeak the Language of his own Thoughts. He neglects the Paſſages that favour all other Forms of Government and Methods of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration; or elſe he conſtrains them to mean Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy too: Every Word that he reads, hath a <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Aſpect; and the firſt Verſe of <hi>Geneſis</hi> can prove Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy (for ought I know) as it has been able heretofore to demonſtrate <hi>Papacy,</hi> when <hi>In principio creavit Deus coelum &amp; terram,</hi> decided the Controverſy, and ſet the <hi>Pope</hi> above the <hi>Emperor</hi>: For God made all things from one Beginning, and not from two.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="199" facs="unknown:006440_0214_1028F13884AFEF98"/>
                  <hi>Synodias</hi> reads the Bible with a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Glaſs, and <hi>Fratrio</hi> with a Congregational Optick: They can find nothing there but their own Opinions, and both of them wonder that <hi>Diaecion</hi> ſhould not ſee them too. <hi>Fratrio</hi> turns over the Scriptures with great Diligence and Meditation, and as often as he finds the Word <hi>Church</hi> there, he thinks of nothing but a Congregation of faithful Men; as the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem, Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Antioch</hi> are ſo many ſingle Congregations. When <hi>Synodias</hi> meets the ſame Word in his Bible, he is often in the midſt of an Aſſembly of Divines; and eſpecially when any Power is attributed to the Church, he is ſure it muſt intend a Claſſis of Presbyters, or Conſiſtory of Elders. When the ſame Word falls under the Eye of <hi>Diaecion</hi> in his Courſe of reading the New Teſtament, he cannot imagine any thing is meant ſhort of a Dioceſs: All his Churches are or ſhould be as big as Counties or Shires. And I might add, that when poor <hi>Parochianus</hi> the Maſon finds Leiſure to read a Chapter, and lights upon the mention of a Church in it, he thinks immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately of a tall Stone-Building with a Steeple upon it, a Bell or two, and a Weather-cock.</p>
               <p>I might give the like Inſtances of many other Terms and Expreſſions in Scripture, to which Men have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterably fixed their ſeveral different Ideas, and rais'd Conſequences from them, and interpret the Word of God by them, without enquiring whether their Ideas are conformable to the Senſe in which the Scripture uſes thoſe Expreſſions: and then 'tis no Wonder that their Schemes of Eccleſiaſtical Government are ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent: And yet each of theſe prepoſſeſſed Opiniators think their own Expoſition of the Text ſo evident, that they chide the Perverſeneſs of all other Men, as though they were reſolved to wink againſt the Light. 'Tis like a Perſon of a fretful Conſtitution, whoſe Eyes are alſo tinged with the <hi>Jaundice,</hi> he quarrels with
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:006440_0215_1028F13BBA606988"/>
every Man that he meets, becauſe he will not conſent to call all things yellow. Thus by the falſe Light of Affection in which they behold ſome beloved Texts, and their Negligence of all others, or at leaſt by the Colours of Prejudice that they throw upon them, each triumphs in his own Sentiments, and pronounces the Apoſtles and Prophets of his Side. Then he lets fly many a ſharp Invective againſt all the Men that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to oppoſe him; for in his Senſe they oppoſe the Apoſtles themſelves, and fight againſt the Authority of God.</p>
               <p>But when a Man takes a Bible into his Hand without a pre-conceived Scheme in his Head, and though he may make uſe of Syſtems to ſecure himſelf from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtencies, yet he puts them not in the Place of the Holy Scriptures, but reſolves to form his Body of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity by the New Teſtament, and derive all his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and Practices thence; he will then find ſo many Expreſſions that ſeem to favour the ſeveral contending Parties of Chriſtians, that in ſome Points he will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be tempted to doubt of all Opinions, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times have much ado to ſecure himſelf from the Danger of Eternal Scepticiſm: When in any doubtful Point his Judgment is led to a Determination, 'tis always with great Caution, and by ſlow Degrees: He is not carried by Violence to any Dogmatical Concluſion; he is modeſt in his Aſſertions, and gentle towards all whoſe Judgment and Conſcience have determined them ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Way, becauſe he met with ſo many probable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments on their Side, in the Time of his Dubitation and Inquiry, that had almoſt fix'd his Opinion the ſame Way too.</p>
               <p>If I may be permitted to ſpeak of myſelf, I might acquaint the World with my own Experience. After ſome Years ſpent in the Peruſal of Controverſial Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and finding them inſufficient to ſettle my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:006440_0216_1028F13FF477C340"/>
and Conſcience in ſome great Points of Religion, I reſolved to ſeek a Determination of my Thoughts from the Epiſtles of Sr. <hi>Paul,</hi> and eſpecially in that weighty Doctrine of Juſtification: I peruſed his Letter to the <hi>Romans</hi> in the Original, with the moſt fixed Meditation, laborious Study, and importunate Requeſts to God, for ſeveral Months together: Firſt without conſulting any Commentator, and afterwards called in the Aſſiſtance of the beſt Criticks and Interpreters. I very narrowly obſerved the daily Motions of my own Mind: I found it very hard to root out old Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, and to eſcape the Danger of new ones: I met with ſome Expreſſions of the Apoſtle that ſway'd me towards one Opinion, and others that inclin'd the Balance of my Thoughts another way; and 'twas no eaſy Matter to maintain my Judgment in an equal Poiſe, 'till ſome juſt and weighty Argument gave the Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; ſo many croſſing Notions, perplexing Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and ſeeming Repugnances lay in my Way, that I moſt heartily bleſs the divine Goodneſs that enabled me at laſt to ſurmount them all, and eſtabliſhed my Judgment and Conſcience in that glorious and forſaken Doctrine of the Juſtification of a Sinner in the Sight of God, by the Imputation of a perfect Righteouſneſs which is not originally his own.</p>
               <p>From my own Experiment I can eaſily gueſs what confounding Intricacies of Thought others paſs through in their honeſt Searches after Truth. Theſe Conflicts did exceedingly enlarge my Soul, and ſtretch'd my Charity to a vaſt Extent. I ſee, I feel, and am aſſured that ſeveral Men may be very ſincere, and yet entertain Notions in Divinity, all widely different. I confeſs now and then ſome Opinions, or ſome unhappy Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences are ready to narrow and confine my Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions again, if I am not watchful over myſelf; but I pray God to preſerve upon my Heart a ſtrong and
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:006440_0217_1028F142C5213B80"/>
laſting Remembrance of thoſe Days and thoſe Studies, whereby he laid within me the Foundation of ſo broad a Charity.</p>
               <p n="5">V. <hi>Fifthly.</hi> Another Cauſe of Uncharitableneſs is a <hi>Want of Reflection on the Grounds of our own Opinions.</hi> We ſhould be more juſt to ourſelves, and more gentle to others, if we did but impartially review the Reaſons why we firſt embraced our ſeveral Principles and Practices.</p>
               <p>Perhaps 'twas Education determined moſt of them, then let us chide ourſelves ſeverely for building upon ſo careleſs and ſlight a Bottom: Or let us be civil to the greateſt part of Mankind, who came by all their Principles the ſame Way. Perhaps we were led into particular Notions by the Authority of Perſons whom we reverence or love; then we ſhould not upbraid our Neighbours that have been influenced into different Sentiments by the ſame Springs. Perhaps we have felt Intereſt ſometimes ready to byaſs our Thoughts, and give us a ſecret Inclination or Averſion to a Party; let us then pity the Frailty of Human Nature, and have Compaſſion upon Men whoſe Judgments are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſo mean a Bribery, and ſometimes have been warped aſide from the Truth. Or finally, perhaps it was deep Meditation, a daily Search into Scripture, and fervent Prayer were the Methods by which we purſued Knowledge, and eſtabliſhed our Principles upon ſolid Reaſon. Let us then be ſo charitable to thoſe whom we contend with, as to ſuppoſe they ſought after Truth the ſame Way, and then our Contentions will have leſs Fire and Spleen in them, leſs of Clamour and Indignation againſt thoſe that differ from us.</p>
               <p>The true Reaſon why we kindle our Anger againſt our Chriſtian Brethren that are not intirely of our Party is, becauſe we not only have the Vanity to fancy our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves always in the Right, and them in the Wrong;
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:006440_0218_1028F1444FE179B8"/>
but we judge their Conſciences and their Sincerity too, that they did not come honeſtly and fairly by their Principles, while we never conſider how we our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves came by our own.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. But there are ſtill more Ways to arrive at this Uncharitable Temper: I muſt proceed to <hi>Sixthly</hi>; which is a common Method, and thus to be performed. If we will but <hi>trace the Principles of thoſe that diſſent from us through all the Length of remote and feeble Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, and be ſure to find ſome terrible Abſurdity at the End of them,</hi> we ſhall not eaſily maintain our Charity. O how often do we put their Opinions upon the Rack! we torture every Joint and Article of them, 'till we have forced them to confeſs ſome formidable Errors which their Authors never knew or dream'd of: Thus the Original Notions appear with a frightful Aſpect, and the Sectators of them grow to be the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our Abhorrence, and have forfeited their Right to every Grain of our Charity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Evangillo</hi> believes that <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> has compleatly anſwered the Demands of the Law in order to our Juſtification, and that in the room and ſtead of all Believers. <hi>Nomineus</hi> hears this Doctrine, and thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins his Chain of ſevere and falſe Deductions; then (ſaith he) the Law has no Power to demand Obedience of us; then we are not to be charged with Sin, though we break the Law hourly and profanely; then we may contemn all the Commands, ſport with the Threatnings, and defy God the Lawgiver and the Avenger. He proceeds then to pronounce <hi>Evangillo</hi> a wicked <hi>Antinomian,</hi> and in the Name of the Lord <hi>delivers him up to</hi> Satan, <hi>that he may learn not to blaſpheme. Evangillo,</hi> on the other Hand, (who has been well inſtructed in the Way of Salvation, and has learned the Duties of Faith and Hope, but is not yet ſo well improved in the Charity of the Goſpel) hears <hi>Nomineus</hi>
                  <pb n="204" facs="unknown:006440_0219_1028F148AE99B3E8"/>
preaching up Repentance and ſincere Obedience, as the Conditions of our Juſtification and Acceptance with God to Eternal Life: He ſmites his Breaſt with his Hand, and cries, Surely this Man knows no Uſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in our Religion, he makes void his Righteouſneſs and his Death, he is a mere Legaliſt, a Papiſt, a rank <hi>Socinian,</hi> he <hi>preaches another Goſpel, and though he were an Angel from Heaven let him be accurſed.</hi> Thus when Men dreſs up their Neighbours in all the ſtrained Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of their Opinions, with a malicious Pleaſure they purſue this Thread of Argument, they impoſe horrid Concluſions which can never be drawn from their Doctrines, and never leave the Purſuit till they have puſh'd each other to Blaſphemy and Damnation.</p>

               <p>'Tis a very uncharitable Practice to think that a Man can never journey ſafely to Heaven unleſs his Hat and Shoes be of the ſame Colour with ours, unleſs he tread the very Tract of our Feet, and his Footſteps too be of the ſame Size.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I have long obſerved, ſays an ingenious Writer, that <hi>Chriſtians of different Parties</hi> have been eagerly laying hold on <hi>particular Parts</hi> of the <hi>Syſtem of divine Truths,</hi> and have been contending about them as if <hi>each</hi> had been <hi>all</hi>; or as if the Separation of the Members from each other, and from the Head, were the Preſervation of the Body, inſtead of its Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They have been zealous to eſpouſe the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and to maintain the Honour and Uſefulneſs of <hi>each apart;</hi> whereas their Honour as well as Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, ſeems to me to lie much in <hi>their Connexion</hi>: And Suſpicions have often ariſen betwixt the reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Defenders of each, which have appeared as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable and abſurd, as if all the Preparations for ſecuring one part of a Ship in a Storm were to be cenſured as a Contrivance to ſink the reſt.</q> Thus far Dr. <hi>Doddridge</hi> in a late Preface.</p>
               <p>And I think we may as well borrow the Similitude expreſly from the Scripture itſelf, 1 Cor. xii. 14. <hi>&amp;c. The Body if not one Member, but many. If the Foot ſhall ſay, becauſe I am not the Hand, is it therefore not of the Body?</hi> And how ridiculous would it be if we ſhould
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:006440_0224_1028F156E1201A40"/>
ſuppoſe the <hi>Ear ſhall ſay, becauſe I am not the Eye, I am not of the Body. If the whole Body were an Eye, where were the Hearing? If the whole were Hearing where were the Smelling? And if they were all one Member, where were the Body? The Eye cannot ſay unto the Hand, I have no need of thee; nor again, the Head to the Feet, I have no need of you: Now ye are the Body of Chriſt, and Members in particular.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſame manner, <hi>Repentance, Faith</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> are three neceſſary Graces or Virtues that go to make up a <hi>Chriſtian</hi>; and I might cite ſeveral Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where each of theſe three are made neceſſary to Chriſtianity. Is it not therefore a moſt unreaſonable thing to ſet up either <hi>Repentance, Faith</hi> or <hi>Love</hi> ſo high, as tho' the whole of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> was contained in it, when it is evident that nothing elſe can make a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> but ſuch a Faith as brings with it Repentance and Good Works, or Holineſs of Life, or ſuch a Love as produces Obedience and Good Works, which muſt be the Effect of this Faith?</p>
               <p>In Chriſtianity <hi>nothing avails but ſuch a Faith as works by Love</hi> unto all Holineſs, <hi>Gal.</hi> v. 6. <hi>Repent and believe the Goſpel,</hi> was the firſt preaching of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles, <hi>Mark</hi> i. 15. And in other Places, Faith is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably coupled with Repentance, <hi>Acts</hi> iii. 19. xx. 21. Without Repentance our Sins will not be forgiven us. Without Faith in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> we have no Intereſt in his Salvation. True <hi>Faith</hi> muſt be ſuch as <hi>purifies the Heart,</hi> Acts xv. 9. And produces Good Works as the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Evidences to prove our Faith true, <hi>James</hi> ii. 17, 18.</p>
               <p>What a ſtrange ſort of monſtrous Chriſtian would this be, who pretended to much Faith, but had no Love nor Repentance? And as monſtrous would that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender be, who had Love or Repentance without Faith. As <hi>God hath ſet the Members of the Body, every one of them as it hath pleaſed him,</hi> ſo has he appointed <hi>Faith, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi>
                  <pb n="210" facs="unknown:006440_0225_1028F1586BCDDA18"/>
and <hi>Love</hi> to fulfil their ſeveral Offices in the Chriſtian Life. What a Piece of Madneſs therefore is it, and high Inconſiſtency to ſeparate thoſe Things which God hath joined in his Goſpel? or to preach or paraphraſe very long and talk very much upon e'er a one of theſe, ſo as to hinder that due Reſpect that is to be paid to the other two? There is no Man is or can be a true Believer in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> if he has not <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> producing good Works, as well as that <hi>Faith</hi> which is neceſſary to make a Chriſtian. Let us take heed therefore, leſt we give Occaſion by any of our Diſcourſes to exalt one of theſe Virtues or Graces to the Prejudice of the reſt, for the utter Loſs of either of them will deſtroy all our Pretences to Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Solfido</hi> has formed one of his Chriſtians ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly agreeable to the Shape and Humour of his own Imagination, and dreſſed him up in all the Feathers of ſtrict Orthodoxy that he can find in the ſevereſt Writers, and by a Motto written upon his Forehead has called him the <hi>Man of Faith,</hi> I am at a Loſs to know what Chriſtian Church would receive him into their Communion, when he neither profeſſes <hi>Repentance,</hi> nor <hi>Holineſs,</hi> nor true <hi>Love</hi> to God or Man. It has indeed ſome of the Appearances of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Statue, but it is a Man without Feet or Hands for walking or moving, a Man without Life or Activity to run the Chriſtian Race, or to do any thing for God in the World. What Glory can our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from ſuch a uſeleſs Figure? What Honour can ſuch an imperfect Image poſſibly bring to the Goſpel; Or what Service can he be of in the World or in the Church?</p>
               <p n="10">X. The moſt common Cauſe of Uncharitableneſs, and the laſt I ſhall mention, is, that <hi>a great Part of the Profeſſor of our holy Religion, make their Heads the

Jeſus</hi> the Saviour has been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to them in a good degree of outward Light, but has never been revealed in them with Power, nor their Souls changed by Divine Grace into the Image of the Goſpel. While they boaſt of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Faith they forget their Chriſtian Love.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stellino</hi> has ſtuck his Brain all over with Notions, and fancies his higher Sphere ſufficiently illuminated for the Conduct of Mankind, that's round about him, and beneath him: But this Set of Notions is like a Winter-night overhung with Stars; bright and ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but very cold. Natural Affections have no room in his Soul, 'tis too much Spiritualized with Opinions and Doctrines. His Divinity lies all in his Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the common Duties of Humanity ſcarce ever employ his Tongue or his Hands.</p>
               <p>If a Man does but profeſs every Tittle of his Creed, and believe juſt as <hi>Stellino</hi> believes, he is declared fit for Holy Communion; and if he will but diſpute warmly for the hard Words that diſtinguiſh his Scheme, and can pronounce <hi>Shibboleth</hi> well, he ſhall not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to Death or Damnation, but joined heartily to the Fellowſhip of the Saints, tho' his flaming Immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities proclaim him a Son of <hi>Satan: Satan</hi> himſelf has perhaps a more accurate and nice Skill of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies of Divinity, than the beſt of our Profeſſors and Doctors have arrived at; but his Pride and Malice are Chains of Darkneſs, and make a Devil of him in ſpite of all his Knowledge: Yet <hi>Stellino</hi> affects too near a Reſemblance to <hi>Lucifer,</hi> that fallen Son of the Morning.</p>
               <p>Vices that are odious to human Nature, and wild Licentiouſneſſes of a bitter Tongue which deſtroy all civil Society, are very little Faults in his Opinion, when put into the Balance with Orthodoxy and Zeal.

If my Converſation among Men be blameleſs and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable; if my Practice conſiſt of Virtue and Piety; if I profeſs a ſolemn Faith in <hi>Chriſt</hi> the eternal Word, the only begotten Son of God, who came into the Fleſh, who died to make a true Atonement for the Sins of Men, and teſtify my unfeigned Subjection to him, and declare the Grounds of my Hope; yet I muſt not be admitted to the ſpecial Parts of Worſhip where <hi>Stellino</hi> preſides, becauſe I am not arrived at his degree of Light, and differ from his Expreſſions a little, when I explain the Words <hi>Juſtification</hi> and the <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace.

               <p>Such another Chriſtian is <hi>Miſander</hi>; he reverſes the Duties of Chriſtianity which St. <hi>Paul</hi> deſcribes, <hi>he ſpeaks Evil</hi> of all <hi>Men</hi> but his own Party, he is a <hi>Brawler</hi> and <hi>ungentle, ſhewing Meekneſs</hi> unto none; and while he pretends <hi>that the Grace of God which brings Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has appeared</hi> unto him, he <hi>lives ſtill in Malice and Envy,</hi> and wears the viſible Characters of the Men of Heatheniſm, <hi>hateful and hating one another,</hi> Tit. ii. 11, 12.

               <p>Yet let not any think that I advance Charity ſo high, as to place it in the room of Knowledge and Faith, or to make it a ſelf-ſufficient Ground for our Admittance into Heaven at laſt: Nor can I ſuppoſe it alone to be a ſufficient Plea for a Reception into any viſible Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> on Earth.

In default of theſe the biggeſt Inſtances of Charity will never conſtitute me a Chriſtian: <hi>Except ye believe that I am he,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>ye ſhall die in your Sins,</hi> John viii. 24. <hi>If a Man ſtrive for a Prize, yet is he not crowned unleſs he ſtrive lawfully; (i. e.</hi>) according to the Methods preſcribed in the Goſpel, the Knowledge and the Faith of the Son of God, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 5. and the Sentence of our Lord is dreadful and peremptory. <hi>He that believeth not ſhall be damned,</hi> Mark xvi. 16. <hi>With the Heart Man believes unto Righteouſneſs, and with the Mouth Confeſſion is made unto Salvation,</hi> Rom. x. 10.

               <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo is charged with high <hi>Uncharitableneſs</hi> by this <hi>Momus</hi> for what he ſays, Gal. i. 8, 9. <hi>If any Man preach any other Goſpel to you than that ye have received, let him be accurſed,</hi> and yet he owns v. 7. that it is <hi>not another Goſpel,</hi> but merely <hi>a Perverſion of the Goſpel of Chriſt</hi>; and is this enough to be accurſed for?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Let <hi>Momus</hi> conſider how groſsly the Goſpel muſt be perverted, when it is turned into ſuch a Senſe as the <hi>Galatians</hi> ſeem to have been taught by theſe Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers of their Church, v 7. it is ſuch an Error as would have carried them again into <hi>Judaiſm</hi> with all is <hi>Yokes of Bondage,</hi> would have obliged them <hi>to be Circumciſed</hi> and to obſerve the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Feſtival <hi>Days, Months</hi> and <hi>Years,</hi> Gal. v. 2. Such an Error as ſhews them to have
<pb n="216"

run back to the Ceremonies of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law <hi>for Juſtification</hi> and Acceptance with God, v. 4. Such an Error as gave occaſion to the Apoſtle to charge them, if ye purſue it <hi>ye are fallen from Grace,</hi> i. e. from the Goſpel of Grace: And that <hi>Chriſt would profit them nothing, would become of no Effect to them.</hi> v. 2, and 4.</p>
               <p>And after all it muſt be ſaid theſe are the Words of Scripture, and of the Spirit of God, and not merely of St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf as a private Writer; and will the Man deal thus with Scripture? You ſee to what Lengths this Temper will carry a Man.</p>
               <p>But ſtill he purſues his Accuſation againſt the Apoſtles, and makes St. <hi>John</hi> to be groſsly guilty of want of Charity in his 2d <hi>Epiſtle</hi> v. 9, 10. <hi>If there come any unto you and bring not this Doctrine,</hi> i. e. <hi>The Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Chriſt</hi> mention'd in the foregoing Verſe, <hi>receive him not into your Houſe, nor bid him God Speed; for he that hiddeth him God ſpeed, if Partaker of his evil Deeds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to anſwer the unreaſonable Cenſure of this <hi>Momus,</hi> let us enquire what this <hi>Doctrine of Chriſt</hi> is; and where ſhould we find the moſt important Parts of it but in the ſame Writer? Chap. i. v. 7. <hi>The Blood of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth us from all Sin.</hi> Chap. ii. v. 2. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous is not only our Advocate with the Father, but he is alſo the Propitiation for our Sins,</hi> Chap. iv. 10. <hi>God loved us and ſent his Son to be the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for our Sins,</hi> and that every true Chriſtian <hi>is born of God,</hi> Chap. v. 1, 4. <hi>i. e.</hi> as other Verſes of this holy Writer in his Goſpel explain it, he is <hi>born of the Spirit</hi> of God, <hi>John</hi> i. 13, and iii. 5, 6.</p>
               <p>It appears then that the Errors of ſuch whom the Apoſtle would here exclude from our Friendſhip, are ſuch as do not acknowledge <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to be the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> or not to be a <hi>propitiatory Sacrifice for the Sins of Men,</hi> nor allow that every true Chriſtian is regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and <hi>born of God,</hi> or <hi>of his Spirits, i. e.</hi> by the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:006440_0232_1028F168A1B21D28"/>
renewing and ſanctifying Influences thereof as other Scriptures explain it, particularly <hi>John</hi> i. 12, 13. <hi>John</hi> iii. 3, 5. and as St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſes it, Eph. i. 19, 20. <hi>By ſuch a mighty Power which he wrought in Chriſt when he raiſed him from the Dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, I would ask <hi>Momus,</hi> why are the Names of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> appointed ſo generally to be uſed in Baptiſm, which is the Ordinance which initiates us into Chriſtianity? Is it not to put us in Mind that when we profeſs Chriſtianity we profeſs the chief Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles that relate to him as our Saviour, (<hi>viz.) Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to be the Propitiation for our Sins, we profeſs to be <hi>born of the Spirit,</hi> or regenerated and renewed to Holineſs by the Spirit of God? Now if a Man aſſerts himſelf to be a Chriſtian, when he believes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes neither of theſe Doctrines, then St. <hi>John</hi> may be to blame indeed in denying the Benefit of common Chriſtian Friendſhip to ſuch a Man.</p>
               <p>But whither would this <hi>Momus</hi> lead us? What? would he make a Chriſtian out of ſuch Adverſaries to the Name and Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as neither truſt in him as a Propitiation for their Sins, nor hope to be renewed and made holy by the Holy Spirit of God?</p>
               <p>Let us learn of the <hi>Heathen</hi> Poet,
<q>Eſt modus in rebus, ſunt certi denique fines.</q>
               </p>
               <p>There muſt be ſome Meaſures and Bounds ſet to every general Virtue, and even to <hi>Chriſtian Charity</hi> itſelf. This does not extend to Infidels in the ſame Senſe. Surely, there muſt be due Limits ſet to every thing of this kind: They can ſcarce be juſtly called <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and treated <hi>as ſuch,</hi> let their Profeſſion be what it will, who renounce <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in his chief Deſign of coming into the World, as a Propitiation for Sin, and who renounce the Spirit of God as the effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:006440_0233_1028F16BEAF71D70"/>
Spring of our Regeneration and Holineſs. If all <hi>Deiſts</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> may be received into the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church, into our good Eſteem and Friendſhip, thoſe may alſo be our fellow Chriſtians who deny the moſt important Principles of Chriſtianity: But let us take heed that we do <hi>not give that which is holy to ſuch who have no claim to it,</hi> and give Charity and Chriſtian Friendſhip to thoſe, who ſeem, according to the Word of God, to have no Pretence to it.</p>
               <p>It has been <hi>objected</hi> indeed againſt this ſecond as well as againſt the <hi>third Epiſtle</hi> of St. <hi>John,</hi> that they have not ſufficient Proof of their divine Original: Now it would be too large in this Place to enter into a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of that Queſtion: But there is nothing ſaid in this Epiſtle that is diſagreeable to the Senſe of other holy Writers in other parts of Scripture; and by our Proteſtant Writers theſe Epiſtles have been generally repreſented as part of the Word of God in the New Teſtament: Nor can I find ſufficient Reaſon to reject it, merely becauſe ſome Perſons that need a more abundant Meaſure of Indulgence and of Charity than the Scripture ſeems to allow, will not allow it this poſt of Honour, and that is becauſe it excludes them from our Good Eſteem, from <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Communion and Friendſhip.</p>
               <p>Yet after all this Cenſure of <hi>Momus</hi> and his Followers, if any ſuch there be, I would ſtill hope and perſwade myſelf, there are ſome ſerious and pious Souls who have been honeſtly ſeeking after the Truths of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and ſearching the Word of God to find them, who may have indulged ſome uncautious and unhappy Hour, wherein they have ſuffered themſelves to be led away into this great Snare and Temptation of the evil One; ſo that they have begun to doubt of this bleſſed Doctrine of the atoning Sacrifice for Sin by the Blood of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> though it is ſo ſtrongly, ſo expreſly,
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:006440_0234_1028F16D900610E8"/>
and ſo often aſſerted by ſeveral of the Apoſtles in their Writings.</p>
               <p>'Tis my ſincere and earneſt Deſire, that God would ſpeedily break theſe unhappy Snares, whatſoever they are, by which their Thoughts have been captivated into ſo dangerous a Miſtake, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 25, 26. that he would pleaſe to open the Eyes of their Mind by his inlightening Grace, that they may not run on ſo far in this way as to be expoſed to the Loſs of the Benefit of this only Propitiation for Sin, and lay themſelves open to that ſevere Sentence of the Word of God, that <hi>there remains no further</hi> propitiatory <hi>Sacrifice for them, but a certain fearful Expectation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> x. 26, 27. Forgive me, bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> if any of the ſofter Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of animal Nature have warped me aſide, while I am treating of this glorious Virtue of Charity, to indulge theſe milder Sentiments, and depart in any Meaſure from the ſtricter Senſe and Sentence of thy holy Word.</p>

                  <hi>SECT. III.</hi> The miſchievous Effects of Uncharitableneſs.</head>
               <p>Now if we have not dwelt too long on this Subject, (<hi>viz.</hi>) in tracing out this Miſchief through its ſeveral <hi>Springs</hi> and <hi>Properties,</hi> and if my Reader be not quite out of Breath, I would ask him to take another Turn with me and walk down to a ſhort Survey of the ſame Vice in its <hi>miſchievous Effects</hi>; that we may be more warmly animated to purſue this Iniquity to the Death: If it were poſſible, we would leave it neither Root nor Branch, Name or Memory in the Chriſtian World.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The firſt and moſt obvious Miſchiefs I meet with among Chriſtians of an uncharitable Humour, are the
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:006440_0235_1028F16F1DFF17A8"/>
conſtant Diſquiet of their own Spirits, the Vexation they give their Neighbours, the Injury they do to their own Edification, and to the Edification of all that converſe with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Singulario</hi> has a Sett of Notions and Rules whereby he adjuſts his own Creed and his Practice; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he hears in Religious Conference, or in publick Duty, that does not preciſely ſquare to his Model, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets his Ears, diſreliſhes with his Taſte, diſturbs his Conſcience, and thus prevents all the Benefit that his Soul ſhould receive from the Diſcourſe, or Worſhip.</p>
               <p>I grant it very lawful for a Man to be diſguſted with a Sermon, where the greateſt part is ſpent in Notions contrary to his Judgment, and dreſt up in Language very foreign to his uſual way of Converſe about divine Things; this is ſhocking to the Spirit of the beſt Chriſtians, and the Conſcience is ſo nauſeated with the largeſt part of the Entertainment that his Soul cannot be nouriſhed, and 'tis proper for him to forbear Attendance upon ſuch a Preacher, and chuſe one more ſuited to the Temper of his own Spirit. But <hi>Singulario</hi> hath an Averſion to a whole Hour's Diſcourſe, becauſe there were three Sentences of a Strain different from his Opinion. He reaps no Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from a Sermon of excellent Compoſure, of divine Materials, of an evangelick Frame and juſt Method, becauſe there's one Expreſſion in it that is the Characteriſtick of another Sect. He ſits uneaſy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a noble Diſcourſe of Juſtification or of Faith, becauſe (it may be) the Miniſter doth avoid the Terms <hi>Imputed, Meritorious, Condition,</hi> and <hi>Inſtrument</hi>; and mentions none of the tortured Words of Noiſe and Party.</p>
               <p>I will not indeed commend a Preacher that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways affecting to diſguiſe his own Opinions, and for ever hiding himſelf in ambiguous Language, and that
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:006440_0236_1028F17409DA79E8"/>
in Points of Moment, thereby to maintain the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Applauſe of all Sides. But I muſt chide <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulario</hi> for the wry Faces he makes at Church when he hears but a Word or two of contrary Sound, or when his Ears miſs and long for a Sett of darling Phraſes.</p>
               <p>Three Years ago I was in Company with <hi>Achariſſa,</hi> a ſour old Chriſtian of a very narrow Spirit, and gave her a gentle Admonition for the frequent Reproaches ſhe caſt on the Miniſters of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that did not preach exactly according to her Humour; I blamed that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulant Liberty which ſhe took with all her Neighbours and Acquaintance, to cenſure them ſeverely for every leſſer Difference of Practice or Worſhip: I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to her reading that valuable Sermon of the Reverend Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi> againſt Evil-ſpeaking; but I could not perſwade her to peruſe thoſe few Pages, not only becauſe of that ſtrong Propenſity ſhe had to ſpeak Evil of others, but becauſe 'twas the Work of an Arch-Biſhop; <q>which ſort of Office, ſaid ſhe, is a mere Human Invention, and the Scripture knows it not.</q> I know another Name which has the ſame narrow Spirit. <hi>Sequilla</hi> hath ever given up the Conduct of her Soul to the Curate of her Pariſh, and after many Years Attendance on his Miniſtry, in great Security of Conſcience, is well aſſured that ſhe ſhall go to Heaven at laſt. Perhaps by ſome terrible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, or by ſome plain Word of Scripture, ſhe is awakened to a deep and frightful Senſe of Sin, and Danger of Eternal Death. She is viſited by the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and though he ſaith ſome good things to her, yet ſhe finds not the Way of Peace. A kind Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour recommends to her ſome Book of Conſolation written by a Diſſenter, but ſhe refuſes the Book and the Comfort at once, leſt ſhe ſhould be guilty of that damnable Sin of Separation from the Church. <q>How can I ever, ſaid ſhe, expect the Peace of God from
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:006440_0237_1028F1766A19D500"/>
the Pen of a Schiſmatick?</q> And thus endures the Racks of Conſcience rather than ſhe will indulge Charity enough to hear of to read what a Nonconformiſt hath written.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Presbycolo</hi> a Chriſtian of the ſame Stamp, heard a Sermon lately and commended it above meaſure, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed how much Light and Love was kindled in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>is Heart by it, and beſtowed unuſual Strains of Reſpect upon the Miniſter: But <hi>Presbycolo</hi> (ſaid I) <q>This Man never had the Hands of a Biſhop, or preaching Elder, laid upon his Head to ordain him.</q> At once I ſaw his Colour change, his Spirits ſink, and he concluded that all the divine Affections in his Soul under that Sermon muſt needs be counterfeit, <q>becauſe now I know (ſaid he) the Preacher is no Miniſter of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                  </q> O the wretched Influence of this Vice of Uncharitableneſs upon feeble and deluded Souls! It proceeds ſo far at laſt as to make Perſons ſcrupulous of attending upon any Ordinance, leſt the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ſhould not be a Man exactly of their Stamp. Thus their Hearts are vex'd with everlaſting Diſquiet, for they can hardly hear a Prayer, or an Exhortation, but they find ſome Offence in it; like a Man with a Thorn in his Hand, whatſoever he takes hold of gives him Pain, but the Cauſe lies in his own Fleſh.</p>
               <p>There are other Inſtances of this Kind to be met with in the World. <hi>Nitidelli</hi> wears his Hair three Inches below his Shoulders, and 'tis ever well beautified with Powder: He frequently eats of a Diſh of Food where Blood is one of the Ingredients, and he often takes half a Pint of red Wine to his own Share: He maintains ſerious Religion at Home and abroad: But <hi>Cenſorina</hi> cannot join with him in the ſpecial Ordinances of Worſhip. <q>It is a ſhame for him (ſhe cries) to wear long Hair; he is a Wine-bibber, and he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtains not from Blood; nor can I be reconciled to
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:006440_0238_1028F178333B72B0"/>
him upon any Terms, unleſs he retrench theſe hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Exceſſes.</q> But he ſtill goes on careleſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of the Peace of his Fellow-Chriſtian, and ſcorns her little Clamours, rather than endeavours, by Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs and Compliance, to ſatisfy or remove them. <hi>Now walkeſt thou not charitably, O</hi> Nitidelli, <hi>for thou grieveſt thy Siſter with thy Meat and Garments, for whom Chriſt died.</hi> But I would fain have <hi>Cenſorina</hi> learn alſo <hi>that the Kingdom of God is not Meat and Drink, but Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Both of you therefore ought to <hi>follow after things which make for Peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.</hi> Rom. xiv. 15, 17, 19.</p>
               <p>Nor is this Miſchief confin'd to ſingle Perſons: It makes a farther Progreſs ſtill, and infects the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and Acquaintance. Every <hi>Monday</hi> in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Crites</hi> ſits at the Head of a Club that meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to arraign and ſentence the Sermons of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Day. <q>Did you mark, my Friends, ſuch an Expreſſion under the fourth Head? It ſounded harſh in my Ears. Surely the Man is not Orthodox; pray acquaint your Families of the Danger of his Opinions, and forbid their Attendance. Truly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies <hi>Momion,</hi> he inſiſted ſo much on the Grace of God, that he left but one quarter of his Hour-Glaſs for the Duties of the Goſpel; I fear he's a <hi>Supralap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarian,</hi> my Spirit riſes againſt him, and I muſt warn my Acquaintance of his Doctrine.</q> A third Perſon in the Company begins to ſurmiſe that his Morals are not good: <q>I have heard an ill Story of a Preacher not long ſince, ſaith he, and ſurely this muſt be the Man?</q> And then he proceeds in a direct Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the Grace of Charity, as it is deſcribed by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 5. <hi>Tit.</hi> iii. 3. <q>I eaſily believe all that is evil of him; I am provoked at him; I hope no Good from him; I cannot bear his Principles; I
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:006440_0239_1028F179D3B81C68"/>
cannot endure his Perſon; and I ſhould rejoice <hi>in the ſeaſonable Death of ſuch an Antinomian as this is.</hi>
                  </q> Thus does the Root of Bitterneſs ſpring up into wide Branches, it bears poiſonous Fruit, and many Souls are troubled. Bleſſed be God who of late Years begins to purge out this ſour Leaven from amongſt us.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The next pernicious Effect I take Notice of, is, that an <hi>uncharitable Carriage brings a Diſgrace and Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh upon Chriſtianity, beyond the Guilt and Scandal of</hi> Heatheniſm: 'Tis the Character of the Gentiles indeed, that they were <hi>hateful and hating one another</hi>; but not for different Principles of Philoſophy which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd, nor different Methods of Worſhip, which they paid to their Gods. There were no Civil Wars pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, nor Courts of Inquiſition erected amongſt them upon this Account, though their Controverſies about divine Things were not trivial, and they differ'd widely in the very Foundations of Religion; and, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>But if the Heathens had been never ſo much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, and quarrelled never ſo fiercely for the ſake of Opinions, and Formalities; ſtill they were almoſt infinitely more excuſable than Chriſtians can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be: For the very Doctrines of moſt of their Sects permit Revenge; and they have many a bloody Principle amongſt them. But Chriſtianity is the moſt mild, the moſt gentle, and the moſt peaceable Religion: Never a Doctrine was taught amongſt Mankind, that hath ſo much of Love and Sweetneſs in it: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Syſtem, or Rule of Duties, wherein Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Candor, Charity and Compaſſion are ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, and inforced.</p>
               <p>Never was there a Religion inſtituted by God or invented by Men, with ſo much Goodneſs in the
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:006440_0240_1028F17E12EBFA98"/>
Heart and Soul of it, or ſo many Charms and Amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſes in the Face. 'Tis built upon the Foundation of God's Eternal and Unchangeable Love. 'Twas Love that aſſumed Human Nature, and became the great Prophet and Teacher of it, and the Spirit of Love in our Hearts is its Vital Spring within us: 'Tis divine Love dwelling in Fleſh, hanging upon a Croſs, bleeding, and dying for Enemies and Rebels, that hath purchaſed all the promiſed Bleſſings of our Religion; and 'tis the ſame Love ariſing from the Grave, and reigning in Glory, that diſtributes theſe Bleſſings to Men: And in all the melting Language of Compaſſion and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs invites us to receive them: 'Twas this Love dwelling perſonally amongſt Men, calls himſelf our Brother, and charges us to love all the Profeſſors of the ſame Faith as Brethren: He requires that we ſhould be ready to lay down our Lives for one another, as he did for us all: And orders it to be the diſtinguiſhing Character of all his Followers, <hi>Hereby ſhall all Men know, that ye are my Diſciple, if ye love one another,</hi> John xiii. 34, 35.</p>
               <p>God himſelf is infinite and unſeen Love, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is Love incarnate and viſible: And a Chriſtian is or ſhould be an Effigy of that Love graven to the Life, by the Finger of the divine Spirit. Now, for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of ſuch a Doctrine to quarrel about Trifles, and grow malicious upon every Punctilio of different Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, how groſly do they abuſe the Chriſtian Name? They rob their own Religion of its due Honour amongſt Men, and bring infinite Shame and Diſcredit upon Chriſtianity in the Face of Infidel Nations. 'Tis for the ſake of this Madneſs which is found amongſt the pretended Followers of our bleſſed Lord, his Name is blaſphemed among the Heathens; and the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Kingdoms of this World to the Faith of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> rendered almoſt rationally impoſſible.</p>

                  <hi>O my Soul, come thou not into their Counſel; unto their Aſſembly mine Honour be not thou united; for in their Anger they have ſlain</hi> Millions of <hi>Men, and in their Self-will they have digged up</hi> the Foundations of a Thouſand Churches. <hi>Curſed be their Anger for it is fierce, and their Wrath for it is cruel.</hi> Theſe Men of Diviſion at the laſt Judgment Day, may juſtly expect to be divided from <hi>Jacob,</hi> and to be ſcattered far away from the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God. <hi>For God will render to every one according to their Works.</hi> And ſurely theſe bloody Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions are ſuch Works as demand like Revenges from a God of Juſtice; if ſuch as practiſe them die without Repentance.</p>
               <p>If you ask me the Method whereby this uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Temper has advanced to ſuch a Degree of Rage and Barbarity, 'tis very obvious and eaſy to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained. At firſt theſe Men aſſume to themſelves the Name of the Church, and lodge in themſelves a Sort of Infallibility, or at leaſt pretend to a divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to determine finally all doubtful Caſes of Religion, and to rule over the Conſciences of Men. They ſet up the wretched Trade of Creed-making, and demand the Belief of Mankind: Then they give out Decrees, ſuch as <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles never gave, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Damnation againſt all that doubt or disbelieve them; though their Fables are not cunningly deviſed,
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:006440_0242_1028F181FABF2388"/>
becauſe they are made too big for Belief. Some of them contradict the moſt ſubſtantial Principles of Senſe, Reaſon and Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>You will ſee this plainly exemplified in a few In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances I ſhall give of their Decrees and Canons. As, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall affirm that there are more or leſs than ſeven Sacraments, let him be anathematiz'd, excommunicated, or accurſed: Whoſoever ſhall affirm that the Subſtance of Bread and Wine remains in the Euchariſt, together with the Body and Blood of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>or ſhall deny the wonderful Change of the whole Subſtance of Bread into Body, and Wine into Blood, which the Catholick Church calls Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, let him be excommunicated: Whoſoever ſhall ſay, that extreme Unction doth not confer Grace, nor remit Sin, nor eaſe the Sick, let him be excommunicated.</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Canons of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>
                  </note> Thus oftentimes the ſame Anathema and eternal Death is denounced againſt ſuch as diſobey their Decrees about Matters of trifling Importance; Matters which they themſelves can never pretend to be, in their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, neceſſary to Salvation. <hi>He that ſhall ſay a common Miniſter can confirm as well as a Biſhop, let him be excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated: He that ſhall ſay, the Ceremonies, the Veſtments,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in the Celebration of the Maſs, are Incentives to Sin, rather than Duties of Piety, let him be excommunicated: He that ſhall ſay, a Prieſt may become a Layman again, let him be excommunicated: And whoſoever ſhall ſay that the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erarchy of Biſhops, Presbyters, and Miniſters or Deacons is not of Divine Ordination, let him be excommunicated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When this Church has thus excommunicated and curſed Chriſtians better than her ſelf, and caſt them out of her Arms, ſhe gives them up to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Power, <note n="†" place="bottom">See the Hiſtory of the Inquiſition.</note> with an awful and deceitful Charge, that the obſtinate Heretick ſhall not be hurt in Life or Limb; but with a full Deſign that they ſhould be tortured, and deſtroyed. Having ſolemnly delivered
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:006440_0243_1028F1859101B2E0"/>
them to the Devil in their Spiritual Courts, the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Executioner ſends them out of the World; not that their Souls may be ſaved in the Day of the Lord, but that they may be plung'd immediately into utter Darkneſs, where <hi>Satan</hi> dwells.</p>
               <p>'Tis the Command of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, by <hi>Paul</hi> the great Apoſtle, Rom. xiv. 1. <hi>That ſuch as were weak in the Faith ſhould be received to their Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and not troubled with doubtful Diſputations,</hi> ſuch as the Obſervance of Meats and Days, and Things of like Moment: But the <hi>Romans</hi> have now ſo far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel'd againſt this Rule, as to admit Perſons into their Communion upon no other Terms than a blind Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to all the doubtful Diſputables which that Church impoſes. They had an Order from St. <hi>Paul.</hi> Rom. xv. 7. <hi>to receive all ſuch as Chriſt had received</hi>; and conſequently to reject no others but thoſe whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> rejects; but they forgot this charitable Canon of our Lord, while they receive Thouſands to their Communion which have no viſible Marks of the Image of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and reject Thouſands, and curſe them to Hell, whom the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> will acknowledge for his, and pronounce them bleſſed of his Father at the laſt Day.</p>
               <p>When they firſt begin to aſſume this Sovereignty over Faith and Conſcience, they uſe a Shew of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and pretend to inſtruct and enlighten the Weak and the Ignorant. They admoniſh them to hearken to the Church; but if the Ignorant are ſtill weak in Belief, and cannot be convinced of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of their Ceremonies, then they ſend the Sheriff and the Jailor to carry on the Diſpute; a Priſon and the Gibbet are the next Arguments; and when Reaſon and Scripture will not aſſiſt them, they employ Fire and Sword to <hi>contend earneſtly for the</hi> Fables <hi>that were</hi> never <hi>delivered to the Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To draw up an Account of the horrible Effects of
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:006440_0244_1028F1871B167A90"/>
Uncharitableneſs would be to tranſcribe the Eccleſiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Hiſtory of many Ages: Whole Churches and Quarters of the World, the Eaſtern and Weſtern, have damned one another plentifully upon the Account of impoſed Days, and Trifles which the Goſpel leaves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different or rather forbids. How many of the Canons of ancient Councils have been influenc'd in their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation by this aſſuming Spirit, and as terribly enforced in their Execution to the Reproach and Devaſtation of <hi>Chriſtendom?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it moves my Grief and Wonder, that a modern Church that pretends not to Infallibility ſhould aſſume a ſtrange Dominion over our Faith and Practice. It aſſerts its own <hi>Power to decree Rites and Ceremonies, and Authority in Controverſies of Faith</hi>; when in the very proceeding Words it confeſſes, that <hi>the Churches of</hi> Jeruſalem, Alexandria, <hi>and</hi> Antioch <hi>have erred, ſo alſo the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>has erred, not only in their Living and Manner of Ceremonies, but alſo in Matters of Faith.</hi> It demands my Admiration, that ſuch a Church ſhould canonically denounce her Excommunications in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, againſt thoſe that diſſent from her in ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable Things, while they retain all her profeſſed Doctrines of the Chriſtian Faith.</p>
               <p>And 'tis a Pain and a Shame to our Eyes to look backward upon other Times, and to behold Pamphlets written againſt Toleration by ſuch as are Miniſters of the Goſpel of Peace, that perfect Law of Liberty. 'Twas their Opinion then, (and they told the World ſo in Print) that <hi>Sectaries</hi> ought to the ſilenced by the Civil Power: Now <hi>Sectary</hi> is a Name of broad Dimenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and has a terrible Stretch with it; the long Scourge would in Time reach all thoſe who differ from the Hand that manages that Weapon of Chaſtiſement: None muſt be authorized to preach in any Form, but by the Solemnity of impoſing Hands, by a Company of
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:006440_0245_1028F188A8F33338"/>
authorized Men. Becauſe ſome ſubjected themſelves to the Determination of a Synod, they would make it the Duty of all their Neighbours to wear the ſame Yoke; and thought others were bound to become Slaves to the ſame Dictates. But I forbear this Charge, and almoſt wiſh it cancelled: For as the Magiſtrate did not put in practice the uncharitable Pamphlets, ſo thoſe Reverend and Honourable Writers have been taught to acknowledge the Miſtake of their Zeal, when their own verbal Rods have been turned againſt them, and became real Scorpions with Stings and Scourges a thouſand-fold. The Fathers have been dearly inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Value of Toleration and Liberty by moſt abundant Retaliations. The Children have learned to preach this Part of the Goſpel well, and I'm perſwaded they'll never forget it again.</p>
               <p>If we turn over more ancient Annals, the <hi>Marian</hi> Days give us horrible Examples of fiery Zeal in the Clergy, and the glorious Reign of the ſucceeding Virgin-Princeſs is hardly to be purged from the Stain of Blood. Bleſſed be God who has put into the Heart of our Civil Governors to reſtrain the Fury of all Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Adminiſtrators. The long and dreadful Train of Capias's and Goalers, Priſons and Plunderings, Ruin and Baniſhment, Silencings and violent Suppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are no longer the Attendants of the Anathemas of any Church among us. And I hope no Church mourns the Loſs of them; tho' there are ſome Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themas that abide ſtill as Terrors to thoſe that are weak in Faith, and not very honourable Monuments of that Church's Charity.</p>
               <p>In theſe late Years the Scene of <hi>Great Britain</hi> was a little Shadow of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> where Dragoons and the Inquiſition manage Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline. We were brought to the very Gates of <hi>Aceldama.</hi> The Agents of <hi>Rome</hi> were ready with their Inſtruments of
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:006440_0246_1028F18B377111C8"/>
Death. Adored be the Divine Spirit that awaken'd the Rulers of the Church to behold the common Danger, and rais'd in them generous Reſolutions and Promiſes to exerciſe Charity and Temper towards their Brethren. Glory to that God whoſe kind Providence ſent us a Deliverer, and forbid <hi>England</hi> to become a Field of Blood and Matyrdom: And new Songs of Praiſe are ſtill due unto Divine Mercy, for eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Perſon and Heart of our Queen in the Throne and the Principles of ſo glorious an Example and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor. Her gentle Government ſubdues the Hearts of all her People to herſelf; her Charity joins their Affections to one another; her parental Care and Love reconciles Chriſtian Parties, and her Wiſdom unites Chriſtian Nations.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The laſt Miſchief I ſhall mention, and which ſhould fright us terribly from the Peril of it, is, that <hi>an uncharitable Man wounds the very Vitals of that Religion, by which be hopes for Eternal Life</hi>: And whilſt his Fury rages againſt his Brother for accidental Differences, he ſhakes the very Foundations of his own Chriſtianity, and endangers or prevents his own Salvation; his boaſted Orthodoxy in Opinion is made vain, while his practical Ungodlineſſes are ſo real; and his Faith ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be little better than that of Devils, when he mingles ſo much of their Malice with it. In vain does he glory in the Brightneſs of his Notions; in vain doth he preſume <hi>Darkneſs is paſt, and the true Light now ſhineth: For he that ſaveth he is in the Light and hateth his Brother, he abides in Darkneſs, even till now,</hi> 1 John ii. 8, 9.</p>
               <p>Such a Wiſdom compoſed of mere Opinion and Wrath can never lead aright up to Heaven, for it did not deſcend from thence: <hi>The Wiſdom that is from above is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle, eaſy to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, full of Mercy and good Fruits, without Partiality,
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:006440_0247_1028F18E77A387C0"/>
and without Hypocriſy, and the Fruit of Righteouſneſs is ſown in Peace of them that make Peace: But if ye have bitter Envying and Strife in your Hearts, glory not.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever your Pretences of Truth be, <hi>this is but lying againſt the Truth: This Wiſdom deſcendeth not from above, but is earthly, ſenſual, carnal, deviliſh,</hi> Jam. iii. 14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'Tis impoſſible there ſhould be true Faith without ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Love: <hi>If I underſtand all Myſteries, and have all Knowledge, if I ſpeak with the Tongues of Men and Angels, and have all Faith, ſo that I could remove Mountains, and mere deſtitute of Charity, my Pretenſions to Religion are the mere Sound of noiſy Braſs, or a tinkling Cymbal,</hi> 1 Cor. xiii. 1, 2. 'Tis ſuch a Charity that <hi>ſuffereth long, that is not eaſily provoked, that beareth all things, and believeth all things,</hi> that taketh all Things in the beſt Senſe, <hi>and thinketh no Evil:</hi> 'Tis ſuch a Charity as this that is a ſubſtantial Part of our Religion. Charity in the Heart, is abſolutely required to make up inward Chriſtianity; and the Appearance of it in the Life is a moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Part of Godlineſs.</p>
               <p>'Tis true indeed, that all Graces and Virtues are very imperfect in this preſent State, and there is much of Uncharitableneſs remaining in many a good Man: But that Man can never be good that has no Charity. <hi>Zelotus</hi> has ſpend his Life in declaiming againſt ſome little Modes and Geſtures uſed in Worſhip by his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſtians, or in impoſing ſome uninſtituted Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies on the Conſciences of his Brethren. He hath ſtir'd up the Magiſtrate to perſecute ſome of them to Priſons, and almoſt to Death. He flatter'd his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience with Hopes that his Zeal for the Church ſhould not only render him acceptable at the laſt Day, but provide him a large Reward: He lies now languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon a Bed of Sickneſs, on the very Borders of Eternity, and is terribly awaken'd to behold his own Miſtake; while he ſtands within Sight of the Tribunal
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:006440_0248_1028F191C7CBD1B0"/>
of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the Face of the Judge, his former Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice appears to his Conſcience in its true and frightful Shape; the Fire that hath animated him againſt his Brethren, now flaſhes in his Soul, and diſcovers its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal Source; now he dreads to be made an Example of the ſame Vengeance among Devils, with which he hath purſued his Fellow Mortals; he groans out his laſt Breath in bitter Agonies; cries to the God of Love for Mercy upon his departing Spirit; and expires al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt without Hope. He is gone. But we leave his Soul to the Compaſſions of a God who can better par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don his mighty Errors, than he would forgive others in their little Miſtakes.</p>
               <p>Thus dreadfully hath this Vice of Uncharitableneſs prevailed againſt the Honour of Chriſtianity, and the Peace of Mankind. Thus ſacrilegiouſly hath it taken away one of the brighteſt Marks of the beſt Religion, and that is Love. It hath defaced the Beauty of our holy Profeſſion, ſcandalized the ſacred Name that we bear, made a Slaughter-houſe of the Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and deceived the Souls of Men to their own eternal Ruin.</p>
               <p>Juſt as I had finiſh'd this Eſſay, <hi>Phariſaino</hi> happened to come into my Study, and taking up the firſt Leaf, read the Title, and was perſwaded this Diſcourſe muſt be written againſt himſelf.</p>

                  <hi>APPENDIX</hi> to the firſt Edition.</head>
               <p>IF the Scandal and Cruelty of an uncharitable Temper have not been deſcribed in Characters ſufficiently frightful, it muſt be imputed to a Want of Skill in the Hand that attempted it, for there is no Want of formidable Features in the Vice itſelf. Perhaps a little and unknown Pen hath not Force enough to wage ſucceſsful War againſt this mighty Iniquity; and the Printer, in two or three vacant Pages, permits me to call in the Aid of ſome great and well known Names: Names who fought againſt it in their Lives, who being dead, yet ſpeak, and plead heartily that it may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. They eſpouſed the Cauſe of Charity with a warm Zeal, being perſwaded that it made a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Part of our Religion, and that the contrary Humour was deſtructive to all that is called Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Since this Infection is not confined to one Party of Men, but hath ſpread itſelf wide through all Chriſtian Societies among us, I have taken the Liberty in the foregoing Leaves to ſtrike at it whereſoever I found it; and thoſe who hide this Venom in their Heart ſtill, to whatſoever Tribe they belong, let them hear the Words of their dead Fathers: Let them bluſh at their own Folly, and no longer refuſe to be healed.</p>
               <p>Archbiſhop <hi>Tillotſon</hi> in his Works in Folio, Page 217, acquaints us that <hi>other Sects were diſtinguiſhed by little Opinions, or by ſome external Rites and Obſervances in Religion; but our Saviour pitches upon that which is the moſt ſubſtantial, the moſt large and extenſive, the moſt uſeful and beneficial, the moſt human, and the moſt divine Quality of which we are capable,</hi> and that is Love. And P. 126. He declares that <hi>Uncharitableneſs is as bad
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:006440_0251_1028F19922C04168"/>
an Evidence, either of a true Chriſtian or a true Church, as a Man would wiſh. Damning of Men is a very hard Thing, and therefore whenever we do it, the Caſe muſt be wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully plain.</hi> And P. 364, <hi>We ſhould rather be contented to err a little on the favourable and charitable Part, than to be miſtaken on the cenſorious and damning Side. Our bleſſed Saviour frames his Parables with a remarkable Biaſs to the charitable Side, to reprove the Uncharitableneſs of the Jews, who poſitively excluded all the reſt of Mankind beſides themſelves, from all Hopes of Salvation. An odious Temper, which to the infinite Scandal of the Chriſtian Name and Profeſſion hath prevailed upon ſome Chriſtians to a notorious Degree.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> in his Diſcourſe of the Perſon of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> P. 222, ſaith, <hi>One Chriſtian who is meek, humble, kind, patient and uſeful unto all, that condeſcends to the Ignorance, Weakneſſes, and Infirmities of others, that paſſes by Pro vocations, Injuries and Contempt with Patience and with Silence, (unleſs where the Glory and Truth of God call for a juſt Vindication) that pitieth all Sorts of Men in their Failings and Miſcarriages, who is free from Jealouſies and evil Surmiſes, that loveth what is good in all Men; and all Men, even wherein they are not good, nor do good, doth more expreſs the Virtues and Excellencies of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>than Thouſands can do with the moſt magnificent Works of Piety or Charity</hi> (i. e. Liberality) <hi>where this Frame is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them. For Men to pretend to follow the Example of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>and in the mean time to be proud, wrathful, envious, bitterly zealous, calling for Fire from Heaven to deſtroy Men, or fetching it themſelves from Hell, is to cry,</hi> Hail unto him, <hi>and to crucify him afreſh unto their Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Baxter in his Chriſtian Directory, Part 1. p. 40. writes thus: <hi>Surely if the very Life of Godlineſs lay not much in Unity and Love, we ſhould never have had ſuch Words ſpoken of it as you find in Scripture. Love is to the Soul as our natural Heat is to the Body; whatever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:006440_0252_1028F19BA93D1160"/>
it, deſtroys Life; and therefore cannot be for our Good. Be certain, that Opinion, Courſe or Motion tends to Death that tends to abate your Love to your Brethren, much more, which under Pretence of Zeal, provoketh you to hate and hurt them.</hi> And a little after, <hi>To limit all the Church to your Party, and deny all or any of the reſt to be Chriſtians and Parts of the univerſal Church, is Schiſm by a dangerous Breach of Charity.</hi> And P. 41. he aſſerts it <hi>a moſt dangerous thing to a young Convert to be enſnared in a Sect: It will, before you are aware, poſſeſs you with a fevouriſh ſinful Zeal for the Opinions and Intereſt of that Sect. It will make you bold in bitter Invectives and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures againſt thoſe that differ from them. It will corrupt your Church-Communion, and fill your very Prayers with Partiality and human Paſſions: It will ſecretly bring Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice under the Name of Zeal into your Minds and Words: In a Word, it is a ſecret but deadly Enemy to Chriſtian Love and Peace. Let them that are wiſer and more Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox and godly than others, ſhew it as the Holy Ghoſt directs them,</hi> Jam. iii. 13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Baptiſts</hi> in their Appendix to their Confeſſion of Faith, 1677, ſay, <hi>The Diſcharge of our own Conſciences,</hi> in point of Baptiſm, <hi>doth not any Ways diſoblige or ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enate our Affections or Converſation from any others that fear the Lord; but that we may and do (as we have Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity) participate of the Labours of thoſe whom God hath endued with Abilities above ourſelves, and qualified and called to the Miniſtry of the Word; earneſtly deſiring to approve ourſelves to be ſuch as follow after Peace with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; and therefore we always keep that bleſſed</hi> Irenicum <hi>or healing Word of the Apoſtle before our Eyes,</hi> Phil. iii. 15, 16. And at the End of the Appendix they declare, <hi>that in as much as theſe things (viz.</hi>) Modes of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, <hi>&amp;c. are not of the Eſſence of Chriſtianity, but that we agree in the Fundamental Doctrines thereof, we do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend there is ſufficient Ground to lay aſide all Bitterneſs

               <p>COncerning the Doctrines and Duties which peculiarly belong to the New Teſtament, I have generally concluded this to be a good Rule of Judgment, that according to the Degree of their Importance or Neceſſity to Salvation, ſuch is commonly the Degree of their Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and the Frequency of their Repetition is, for the moſt part, proportionable to their Uſefulneſs. Thoſe great Truths of our Religion, and thoſe Practices of Chriſtianity, without which we can't be ſaved, are deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed in the Word of God in large and fair Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſo that <hi>he who runs may read them.</hi> Theſe <hi>Viſions</hi> and Revelations of the Mind and Will of God our Sovereign, <hi>are written and made plain upon the Tables</hi> of the Evangeliſts, or of the Apoſtles, <hi>Heb.</hi> ii. 2. they are not mentioned once and briefly, but many Pages explain and repeat them; they ſtand in a divine and convincing Light, and may eaſily be underſtood by thoſe who with a humble and teachable Spirit, inquire what they muſt believe and do, in order to pleaſe God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="240" facs="unknown:006440_0255_1028F1A45CC7EF68"/>This Remark is much confirmed by that Promiſe which aſſures us that it ſhould be ſo in Goſpel-times. <hi>The High way</hi> to Heaven is ſo <hi>plain, that the way-faring Men,</hi> or Strangers, <hi>though they be Fools</hi> in Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, <hi>ſhall not err therein,</hi> Iſai. xxxv. 8. A Man that labours in his daily Calling, in the City or the Field, or a Servant in the loweſt Rank of Life, may, with due Application in their vacant Moments, be acquainted with the neceſſary Truths and Duties of our Religion; beſides that the Spirit of God is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to ſincere and diligent Seekers, to faithful and humble Inquirers, and ſhall be beſtowed ſufficiently to inform them of the ſure way to eternal Life, Prov. ii. 1.6. <hi>If thou crieſt after Knowledge, and lifteſt up thy Voice for Underſtanding, if thou ſeekeſt her as Silver, and ſearcheſt for her as for hid Treaſures,</hi> then <hi>ſhalt thou un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Fear of the Lord, and find the Knowledge of God.</hi> Luke xi. 13. <hi>Your heavenly Father ſhall give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him.</hi> And the Spirit is <hi>ſent to guide</hi> the Faithful <hi>into all Truth,</hi> John xvi. 13.</p>
               <p>The Wiſdom, the Equity and the Goodneſs of God ſeem all to concur in fixing Matters of neceſſary Belief and Practice in this Situation, <hi>i. e.</hi> That they ſhould be often and plainly expreſt. If there be any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Doctrine or Duty which I find written but in one ſingle Text of Scripture, or expreſt but darkly, I ſhould reaſonably conclude the Great God never deſigned that Doctrine, or that Duty to be of very great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance in the Chriſtian Life: For a dark Expreſſion is much more eaſily miſtaken, as to the true Senſe of it; and a ſingle Text is more liable to be <hi>miſcopied,</hi> or <hi>dropt</hi> by a Tranſcriber, or be <hi>miſconſtrued</hi> by a Tranſlator, or <hi>overſeen and neglected</hi> by a common Reader or Hearer; and the Great God would not put Matters of high Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance on ſo doubtful and dangerous a Foot, and leave Things neceſſary at ſuch Uncertainties, leſt honeſt

and humble <hi>Enquirers ſhould,</hi> after all their Pains, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take their Way to Heaven.</p>
               <p>A ſudden Thought of the <hi>Form and Order of Baptiſm,</hi> preſcribed to us, <hi>Matth.</hi> xxviii. 18. made me at firſt ſuſpect, that there muſt be one Exception made to this Rule, about the frequent Repetition of any Doctrine or Duty neceſſary to Salvation; but upon a further Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration and Review of Things it appears evident to me now, that tho' this Appointment of the <hi>Form of Baptiſm</hi> was preſcribed to be done in <hi>the Name of the Holy Spirit,</hi> as well as <hi>of the Father and the Son,</hi> yet it was by no means neceſſary to the Salvation of any Man, and therefore there was no neceſſity of having it often repeated. Let us <hi>conſider</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1ſt, That the Appointment of it is but once ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and that by one holy Writer, and there is never an actual Example or Inſtance of this compleat Form of Baptiſm practiſed in any place of Scripture. Obſerve that remarkable Text, <hi>Acts</hi> xix. 2. where St. <hi>Paul</hi> inquired of the young Converts that were baptiſed at <hi>Epheſus, Have you received the Holy Ghoſt ſince you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved? and they ſaid unto him, we have not ſo much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghoſt.</hi> He then inquired, unto what were ye baptiſed? and they ſaid, <hi>Unto John's Baptiſm</hi>; and <hi>Paul</hi> had told them that <hi>John</hi> taught them, <hi>that they ſhould believe on him that ſhould come after him,</hi> that is, in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus: when they heard this, they were baptiſed in the Name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> Whether they were baptiſed in the <hi>Name of the Holy Spirit,</hi> or no, is not actually expreſſed; which is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſtrange, when that was the chief Point of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry concerning <hi>their Baptiſm into the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here alſo it may be obſerved, that thoſe who were here baptiſed, <hi>Acts</hi> xix. 5, 6. immediately received the Holy Ghoſt; whence it may be very probably inferred, that ſome Perſons were baptiſed with the Holy Ghoſt
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:006440_0257_1028F1A9542C65F0"/>
itſelf, who were not actually baptiſed into the Name of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conſider</hi> 2dly, When the Buſineſs of Baptiſm is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in ſeveral Places in the Epiſtles, it is generally declared that Baptiſm was performed in the Name of the Lord <hi>Jeſus, Rom.</hi> vi. 3. ſo many of you as were baptiſed into <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> were baptiſed into his Death, <hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 27. As many of you as have been baptiſed into <hi>Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 13. By one Spirit we are baptiſed into one Body, i. e. <hi>Chriſt</hi> as in the foregoing Verſe, but I can find no mention of the Diſciples being bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed into the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly, Though I am ready to believe from many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in the Primitive Hiſtory of the Church, that the Baptiſers did uſually keep to this Form of Words, <hi>I baptiſe thee in the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> yet it is evident from a long Account which <hi>Grotius</hi> gives us upon this Text, <hi>Matt.</hi> xxviii. 18. that they uſed divers Forms, that is, they ſometimes expreſſed the <hi>Father</hi> by a Periphraſis, <hi>The God of all, or the God of the whole, the God and Father of the whole,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>the Son</hi> was expreſſed by the <hi>Word,</hi> or the <hi>only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son of God:</hi> Sometimes <hi>the Holy Ghoſt</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the <hi>Spirit who inſpired the Prophets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I might add, that upon their Profeſſion of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Religion, ſometimes it is called the Profeſſion of the <hi>Remiſſion of Sins,</hi> or the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> or <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life,</hi> but they never made a Scruple of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rightly baptiſed into Salvation upon any of theſe Accounts; and I am perſwaded that had the Apoſtles themſelves, or the primitive Chriſtians, thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation, the Form of Baptiſm would have been more expreſs in the Hiſtory of it, and been more particularly repeated.</p>
               <p>I think therefore the <hi>Rule</hi> may ſtand good ſtill, that where a Doctrine or a Duty is mentioned but in one
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:006440_0258_1028F1ABC3DD22C0"/>
ſingle Place of the Scripture, it cannot be of abſolute Neceſſity to Salvation. I hope the Reader will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give this long Digreſſion, and then proceed.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, where particular Truths or Duties are often repeated in Scripture, and very plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in ſeveral Places, it is hardly poſſible that they ſhould be ſubject to theſe Inconveniencies. It is not to be ſuppoſed that the Tranſcribers of the New Teſtament ſhould make the ſame Miſtake in every Place, where theſe Propoſitions are mentioned; that they ſhould drop them out of every Chapter; that the Traſlator ſhould miſconſtrue them in every Text; or that their Miſconſtruction ſhould always ſeem to make good Senſe in every Context where they ſtand; or finally that the Hearer or Reader ſhould always overlook them when they are found in ſo many paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, and ſo often occur to his Ear or Eye.</p>
               <p>But it is very apparent, and all Men muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that Matters of leſs Moment, and things not neceſſary, are not mentioned ſo often: And when they are mentioned, the Scripture ſometimes gives no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination or poſitive Injunctions about them; nor do the Apoſtles determine the ſmaller Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies with that plain, exact and poſitive Method of Speech, which you find them uſe in the moſt ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Truths and Duties. If we read the 14th <hi>Chap.</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> it muſt convince us of this Aſſertion. St. <hi>Paul</hi> does not there decide the little Controverſies about Obſervations of Meats and Days, but ſeems to leave them to Charity. Nor are the leſſer Points of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity half ſo often mentioned, or urged with half ſo much Vehemence, as the grand Duties of Faith and Love, Repentance and Holineſs. In matters of lower Concernment among the Formalities and Modes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or even in ſome higher Articles, whoſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and logical Relations are not neceſſary to
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:006440_0259_1028F1AF13424470"/>
Salvation, the Scripture has its <hi>dusnoeta</hi> et fere <hi>aluta,</hi> as Divines call them, <hi>i. e.</hi> almoſt insolvable Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Things, very hard to be underſtood by Men in this State, at leaſt by common Readers.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the Matter is ſo ſublime, ſo unlike all mortal Affairs, and ſo divinely ſuperior to every thing here below, that perhaps 'twas not poſſible to deſcribe it fully and plainly in human Words: And the more enlightned the Writer or Speaker was, the deeper and more inexpreſſible might ſome of the Truths be which he reveals. Our Saviour has made ſome ſuch Diſcoveries at the latter end of his Prayer in the 17th of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel. Such are the Doctrines of the <hi>Union or Oneneſs of Chriſt with God his Father,</hi> and the <hi>Oneneſs or Union of the Saints with God and Chriſt.</hi> Some things are conſtrained to be expreſſed in a human way leſs ſuitable to their own Dignity, and yet even then they are not perfectly eaſy to be underſtood, for earthly Metaphors will not convey to our Thoughts a full Idea of things divine and heavenly. When <hi>Chriſt</hi> had been teaching <hi>Nicodemus</hi> the Doctrine of Regeneration, <hi>John</hi> iii. 12. he adds, <hi>If I have told you earthly things and ye believe not, how ſhall ye believe if I tell you of heavenly things?</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> the moſt enlightned of all mere Men, ſaw and heard ſome things among his Viſions and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, that were <hi>unutterable,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. And <hi>ſome things</hi> which he has publiſhed for the Uſe of the Church, <hi>according to the Wiſdom given to him, are hard to be underſtood,</hi> as St. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf aſſures us, 2 <hi>Peter</hi> iii. 16.</p>
               <p>Again, I might take Notice that in Matters which are <hi>Prophetical,</hi> both in the Old Teſtament and in the New, there are many dark Expreſſions, many Parables and hard Figures of Speech, which are made uſe of to expreſs and convey ſome general and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinct
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:006440_0260_1028F1B1D60F9928"/>
Ideas of future Events, which were not fit to be more fully revealed in that Day, and which only the Accompliſhment was deſigned to explain the future Days or Ages. <hi>When theſe things are come to paſs, then ſhall ye know that I have foretold them,</hi> John xiii. 19. <hi>and</hi> xiv. 29. <hi>and</hi> xvi. 4.</p>
               <p>The Spirit of God, for wiſe Ends, hath expreſſed ſome Things in particular Seaſons, whether Doctrinal or Prophetical, in obſcure Phraſes, capable of a double Interpretation. Other things are very briefly hinted, and the holy Writer doth but juſt glance at them in paſſing, and does not dwell upon them long enough to explain them, that being not his preſent chief De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>
               <p>Some Words are ſo ambiguous and of various Meaning in the ſame Chapter, that it is not eaſy to determine their preciſe Senſe in each Verſe; and theſe Words alſo transferr'd into our Language may not have the ſame different Meanings as the Original, and perhaps too, may be determined to the wrong Senſe by the Tranſlators; but the Vulgar can read only their own Language, and their Judgments are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the Tranſlators Opinion. The various Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings put on the Words <hi>Nomos</hi> the Law, <hi>ekkleſia</hi> the Church, <hi>cheirot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>neo</hi> to ordain, <hi>epiſkopos</hi> a Biſhop or Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſufficiently prove this.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the Senſe of many a Scripture depends not merely on the literal Conſtruction of the Words, but on the Knowledge of the Context, and on the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the Scope and Deſign of the Writer, and perhaps the deeper Deſign of the Spirit of God that inſpired him: It depends on the Character of the Perſon that writes, and on the Character and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Perſons to whom he writes, into what Errors or evil Practices they were fallen, at what Time, and under what Circumſtances theſe Things fell out:
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:006440_0261_1028F1B3636D6988"/>
All which it is impoſſible every Mechanic ſhould know, and but few Scholars are well acquainted with: Theſe Difficulties in Scripture occaſion different Opinions among the Readers; and becauſe each would impoſe his Senſe upon all the reſt of Chriſtians, a thouſand quarrelling <hi>Folios</hi> have ſprung.</p>
               <p>There is another Difficulty and Shade of Darkneſs which falls upon many Texts of Scripture, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the New Teſtament, from the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Actions and Modes of Action in the primitive and inſpired Times. 'Tis certain that ſome things recorded in the Acts of the Apoſtles, and occaſionally ſpoken of in the Epiſtles, refer only to the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and inſpired Tranſactions of thoſe miraculous Times, and cannot be imitated by us: Such are the Communication of Gifts by the Impoſition of Hands, the healing the Sick by anointing with Oil, the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of uſeful Speakers in one Aſſembly, the talking various Languages in publick Worſhip if an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter were preſent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is as certain alſo, that ſome things are recorded in ſome of thoſe Scriptures, as Patterns and Directions for our Imitation in all Ages. Such are the Ordinances of Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper, the Choice of Deacons, the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Overſeers or Biſhops, the Practice of occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Communion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But there are ſome <hi>Circumſtances</hi> relating to theſe Actions, concerning winch it is hard to determine how far they belong to the extraordinary Affairs of that Day, and how far they are Rules for our Conduct in ordinary Caſes.</p>
               <p>Now from all theſe Differences have ariſen many laborious and angry Volumes of Noiſe and Wrangle about the Mint, the Anniſe, and the Cummin, about the Dreſs and the Fringes of Religion, which have vex'd the learned World, and diſquieted and divided the Church of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="247" facs="unknown:006440_0262_1028F1B4FA89D700"/>Notwithſtanding all theſe Difficulties in Scripture, and the divided Sentiments of Men about them; yet there is no room for the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Doctrine of the <hi>Inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of the Holy Scriptutes</hi>; no need of any living Judge of Controverſies, or a Seat of Infallibility on Earth; for the grand Doctrines and Duties which are neceſſary to Salvation, ſuch as Repentance toward God, Faith in the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as a Prophet, a High-prieſt and a King, the Neceſſity of univerſal Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, Pardon of Sin thro' the Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the Dead, and eternal Rewards and Puniſhments in the World to come; all theſe, I ſay, are written down in Scripture, in as plain and expreſs a manner as the Nature and Importance of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; and about theſe things Perſons of a ſober, humble and honeſt Mind cannot well miſtake, if they are diligent in their Enquiry, and <hi>ſeek Wiſdom of that God who gives liberally, and upbraids</hi> us <hi>not</hi> with our own Folly.</p>
               <p>Not only are all Matters neceſſary to Salvation writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten plain enough for every Reader, but we have alſo, as I hinted before, the Promiſe of the Aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit to teach us to underſtand all ſuch Revelations, that ſincere and diligent Men may not be ſuffered to fall into ſuch a Miſtake as to fail of Acceptance with God. Nay, further, we have good Encouragement to hope, that even in ſome things on which Salvation doth not neceſſarily depend, but are only deſigned to promote the farther Sanctification and Comfort, Peace and Hope of the Church, the Spirit of God will often aſſiſt the upright and humble Seeker, yet ſtill there will remain Difficulties enough to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe inquiſitive Souls, for I find no certain Promiſe, that God will always ſatisfy every ſincere Inquirer in the full Meaning of all difficult Texts.</p>

                  <q>I glorify thee, O my God, that thou haſt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd the Knowledge of thyſelf to the wiſe and the learned World, but haſt written down the Way of Salvation ſo plain, that a Child may read and attain it. Let the Scribes and Doctors and Critics of the Age wrangle about the Pins of the Tabernacle, and the Seats in the Synagogue, let them contend, even to Blood, about the <hi>Ofs,</hi> the <hi>Ands,</hi> and the <hi>More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>overs</hi> of the Bible, my Soul ſhall dwell in Peace, and reſt on theſe Pillars of Safety, even the great and evident Doctrines of the Chriſtian Faith. <hi>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, that thou haſt revealed thy ſelf</hi> and thy Son <hi>unto Babes,</hi> and haſt not made it a Matter of Wit and Criticiſm to be a Chriſtian. The <hi>Fooliſh and the Baſe, and the weak Things of this World are choſen to</hi> Salvation, and they underſtand, and believe, and practiſe all the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Articles, while they may differ from each other in ſome leſſer Forms of Worſhip and Diſcipline, and are not able to maintain an Argument on either Side.</q>
               </p>
               <p>What is here aſſerted concerning the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of ſome of the <hi>leſs neceſſary</hi> Articles of our Religion (<hi>viz.</hi>) that they are ſomewhat obſcurely expreſſed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; the ſame may be apply'd alſo to the <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial</hi> Topicks, to the <hi>Appendices,</hi> and the <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Relations</hi> even of the <hi>greateſt and moſt neceſſary</hi> Points of Chriſtianity, as I hinted before. Tho' the Practice of Repentance, and the Promiſes of Pardon; tho' Juſtification by Faith, and the Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> as a Ranſom for Sinners, are ſo often and ſo plainly affirmed, yet it is not affirmed ſo often, nor ſo plain in Scripture; what <hi>Logical Relation</hi> Faith bears to our Juſtification; whether it is a <hi>Condition</hi> as ſome make it, or a <hi>receiving Inſtrument</hi> as others ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: Nor is it ſo indiſputably and ſo evidently writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:006440_0264_1028F1BC081EE738"/>
in the Word of God, whether <hi>Chriſt</hi> died as a <hi>conditional Atonement for all Sin,</hi> and a Purchaſer of Salvation in general for all that are willing to accept it, or whether as a <hi>ſtrict Repreſentative</hi> only of the Elect, and to procure neither abſolute nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Pardon for any Sins but theirs.</p>
               <p>'Tis evident beyond all doubt, that where the Goſpel comes, <hi>he that believes ſhall be ſaved</hi>: But whether Faith ſaves us as it is a mere Dependance on divine Grace, or on the Prieſthood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or whether it ſaves us rather as a hearty Belief of the Goſpel and the Grace of it, even ſuch a Belief as comes to be the Spring of our Repentance and our Holineſs, this is not ſo exceeding evident as to leave no room for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy.</p>
               <p>It is abundantly revealed in Holy Scripture, that without Repentance of our Sins we can never be ſaved, nor ſhall any of our Inquities be forgiven without a ſincere Converſion to God; but to declare with utmoſt Exactneſs and full Aſſurance what <hi>Logical Relation</hi> our Repentance bears to our Pardon, Scripture hath not taught us quite ſo fully, nor ſo clearly deſcribed it.</p>
               <p>It is ſufficiently plain to every Reader of the Bible, that Holineſs of Heart and Life is of abſolute Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to our Entrance into Heaven, for <hi>without Holineſs no Man can ſee God</hi>: But how far, and in what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Senſe this Holineſs and Obedience to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God can give a <hi>Right to enter into the Gates of the City</hi> is ſomething harder to determine; or what is that ſort of Right or Title which our own ſincere Obedience gives us to the immediate Poſſeſſion of Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs, tho' we are fully aſſured from ſeveral Places in the Word of God, it is very different from the Right which we obtain by the Obedience and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

                  <pb n="250" facs="unknown:006440_0265_1028F1BD926F3D00"/>In ſome Places the ſacred Writer ſeems to mention one Doctrine, while he is purſuing ſome one Subject with Warmth and Zeal; in other Places of Scripture the contrary ſeems to be ſignified or hinted; now both theſe in the literal Senſe, and without Limitation, cannot be true: And which of theſe two Texts muſt be reduced to the other, by certain Diſtinctions and Limitations in order to a Reconciliation, is not ſo eaſy always to determine: For in ſome Inſtances it may happen, that the Propoſiton which is but implied in one Text, is nearer the Truth than another Propoſition which ſeems to be expreſſed in another Place; which can only be decided by a due Survey of the Context, and the different Deſigns of the Writer, and a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of other Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Therefore if we will diſpute about theſe ſolemn Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, let our warmeſt Zeal and our ſharpeſt Weapons be engaged againſt thoſe Adverſaries of the Goſpel, who attempt to ruin the Foundations of it; let us contend moſt earneſtly for the Defence of what God moſt obviouſly and inconteſtably reveals; but our cooleſt Debates, our Candor and Charity, rather than Fierceneſs, ſhould be employ'd about the Points of more dubious Diſcovery: At beſt we ſhould maintain great Moderation ſo long, till we find the leſſer Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors ſpreading like a ſecret Gangrene, and drawing along with them diſmal Conſequences, till they are obſerved to infect the more ſubſtantial parts of Godlineſs, and endanger the Vitals and very Eſſence of Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>If our Reverend Fathers and Brethren have ſhewn a fiery Zeal about theſe leſſer Errors, I would perſwade myſelf their chief Motive was a Suſpicion of Danger and Ruin to the Goſpel itſelf, in the Liberty, in the Purity, and in the Glory of it, if they ſhould have connived at theſe leſſer Miſtakes, or treated them with a cold Indifference: And 'tis poſſible that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:006440_0266_1028F1BFF98FD700"/>
they might have Reaſon for their Suſpicion and their Zeal, though it may be confeſſed they were but Men, and their Fervor might ſometimes exceed due Bounds.</p>
               <p>But, in general, as to theſe meaner Point, <hi>Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is our Duty: <hi>Whereto we have attained, let us walk by the ſame Rule, and if any be otherwiſe minded, God in his</hi> moſt proper Seaſon <hi>will reveal it alſo to them,</hi> Phil. iii. 15, 16. 'Tis as if the bleſſed Apoſtle had ſaid, that <hi>thoſe who truſt only in</hi> Chriſt <hi>and his Righteouſneſs, as the ground of their Acceptance before God,</hi> ſhall be joyfully received to join their right Hand of Fellowſhip with mine; and if they do but <hi>purſue Holineſs ſincerely from the plainer Motives of Chriſtianity,</hi> though they are not well acquainted with thoſe moſt noble Principles of it (<hi>viz.) Communion with a ſuffering, dying and riſing Saviour as a Repreſentative, Pledge and Pattern of ſpiritual dying to Sin, and Reſurrection into Holineſs,</hi> which are contained in v. 10. yet I will not diſturb them about it, but hope God will diſcover it to them in his Time.</p>
               <p>Yet further, as the great <hi>Doctrines</hi> of Chriſtianity and the neceſſary <hi>Duties</hi> of it, are very much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed from the leſs neceſſary Points, and the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantials of thoſe Duties, by their greater Evidence and Clearneſs of Revelation; ſo the more ſubſtantial Parts of the <hi>Worſhip appointed</hi> in the Goſpel, may be diſtinguiſhed from the leſs Important Modes and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. Solemn Prayer unto God, preaching of the Word, Adminiſtration of the Ordinances, Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper, and a due Attendance thereon, are plainly and certainly required of us that aſſume the Name of Chriſtians in our ſacred Aſſemblies. But whether we may borrow Aſſiſtance from compoſed Forms in preaching, praying and other Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; or whether we muſt renounce all Uſe of Forms, Books and Notes to aid our Invention, Memory and
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:006440_0267_1028F1C48614CB10"/>
Expreſſion in Prayers and Sermons, are mere accidental Matters, and not written in Scripture with ſo expreſs a Pen. So whether the Perſon baptiſed muſt be ſprinkled or immerſed, and whether the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants at the Lord's Table muſt ſit, or lean, ſtand, or kneel, are leſs-eſſential Conſiderations, and have been the Subjects of dubious Inquiry.</p>
               <p>Again, in the Conſtitution, Order and Government of a Church, the ſame Diſtinctions may be made alſo. That Perſons profeſſing the Name of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould agree to walk and worſhip together at ſtated Seaſons in the Fellowſhip of the Goſpel, ſeems to be a Demand of the Law of Nature, and ſufficiently confirmed by many Directions or Examples in poſitive Expreſſions of Scripture too; That every ſuch Congregation of faithful People, or voluntary Society of Chriſtians, is a Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi>; That they ought to ſeclude or put away from their Number, the groſly ignorant, the ſcandalous and the prophane, and to <hi>withdraw from thoſe that walk diſorderly</hi>; That there ſhould be Perſons appointed to miniſter to them in holy things, and that the Society ſhould honour and maintain them; All theſe ſeem to be plain and undoubted Duty.</p>
               <p>But whether this Society may receive and exclude Members without or againſt the Conſent of their Paſtor; Whether there muſt be any Elders in a Church diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct from and inferior to the Paſtor or Biſhop; Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Miniſter needs the Impoſition of the Hands of ſeveral Presbyters, or the ſuperior epiſcopal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration; or whether he be ſufficiently ordained by the Choice of the Society, his ſolemn Acceptance, and his own and their devoting him to God in that Office by Faſting and Prayer; theſe things are not quite ſo evident in the Writings of the New-Teſtament. And while we are required to have no Fellowſhip with the openly Wicked, though they are pretended Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:006440_0268_1028F1C6239B8E08"/>
of Religion, yet we are commanded to <hi>receive the Weak in the Faith,</hi> and to hold Communion with them in Common Chriſtianity, though we may all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in <hi>doubtful Diſputations.</hi>

               <p>I am eaſily aware that the Men of Heat and Party, will lift up their Hands in Wonder, when they read this Catalogue and Diſtinction of the Affairs of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity. I ſee them already kindling into Rage againſt me; they incompaſs my Tent and proclaim War. And upon a Review of their Numbers, their Inſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and their Zeal, I cannot find an Advocate want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for any one Sect or Party, among the common Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the Religion of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> I ſee there <hi>Merges</hi> and his Neighbour <hi>Aſpergio</hi>; I find <hi>Sedentius</hi> and <hi>Genicola</hi> both there; <hi>Piſcopion, Claſſicus</hi> and <hi>Antipas</hi> are come thither alſo. Each of them a <hi>Prince of their Tribe, and either a Head or a very forward Member of the Family of their Fathers.</hi> Juſt ſo the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> began to denounce War againſt their Brethren <hi>Gad</hi> and <hi>Reuben,</hi> when they built an Altar of Witneſs to maintain their Communion with the reſt of their Tribes, while they were <hi>Diſſenters</hi> only in point of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, and dwelt beyond <hi>Jordan</hi>: Theſe Party-Men are full of Faith and Certainty in every Opinion; they embrace none as Brethren in <hi>Chriſt</hi> who do not wear their Garb and Livery, and talk not exactly in their Language and Phraſes, nor will they hold Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with thoſe that diſſent from them in the leaſt Punctilio's of the Form or Worſhip of Chriſtians. <q>If Men depart from the Truth, ſay they, they are in the Way of Error; and 'tis all one whether they

depart little or much, ſince they have forſaken the Truth we ought to forſake them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe warm Zealots are not uſed to admit of any Doubt in the ſmalleſt Circumſtantials of Religion, and becauſe they have learnt of their Teachers to affirm all their Tenets with equal Confidence, they believe that the Scripture reveals them all with equal Evidence. A Metaphor ſmiling upon their Practice, is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Command. They can read their indiſpenſable Duty in a ſingle and dubious Example. A remote Concluſion of their own drawing, at the End of a long Chain of Conſequences, gives them reſiſtleſs Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, and appears in their Eye as bright, though diſtant, as the Morning-Star. A Circumſtance or two of matter of Fact determines their Judgment unchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geably, for or againſt an Opinion, which at moſt is but feebly favoured by thoſe very Circumſtances; a little Criticiſm on a ſingle <hi>Greek</hi> Word in ſome ſingle Text of Scripture, becomes a firm Foundation for their Faith: They force ſome Text or other to prove every thing which they ſay, and when they have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed their Senſe on the Words of the holy Writers, they are ſure the Evangeliſts and the Apoſtles are of their Mind. Each of them have pickt up ſome Scraps of the Arguments of their Party, and they fancy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves well equiped and furniſh for the Defence of the Truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Merges,</hi> a very honeſt Man in the main, is newly come out of the Water, and glows all over with Zeal and Aſſurance, that there can be no Baptiſm without plunging: He makes a mere Jeſt of <hi>Baby-Sprinkling,</hi> and declares that if we are not covered with Water, we are not <hi>buried with Chriſt</hi>: No honeſt Man, ſays he, could ever doubt that <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſt at <hi>Enon,</hi> for the Scriptures ſay, <hi>there was much Water there,</hi> John iii. 23.</p>

                  <hi>Aſpergio,</hi> a bold Talker, is as confident that ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or pouring Water on the Head, is a true Method of Baptiſm, and is ready to ſay ſevere things againſt the Practice of Immerſion, as if it were not only need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, but, as they are ready to call it, fooliſh and ſinful.</p>
               <p>'Tis plain, ſaith he, in the Word of God, that he Apoſtles <hi>were baptiſed with the Spirit, which can never mean that they were dipt or plunged into the Spirit, but only that the Spirit was poured out upon them:</hi> And when the <hi>Iſraelites were baptiſed into</hi> Moſes, 'tis plain they were only ſprinkled <hi>with the Cloud and the Sea,</hi> Matt. iii. 11. compared with <hi>Acts</hi> ii. 3, 17. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> x. 2. and therefore, ſays he, I wonder that any Man ſhould be ſo weak as to give himſelf the trouble of Dipping when he has ſuch Texts as theſe to prove Sprinkling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sedentius,</hi> a weak and warm Diſſenter, is juſt come from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Cathedral: Being urged by great Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, with much ado he obtained Leave of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to go thither and ſee Men receive the Lord's Supper kneeling: As he returns he is almoſt ready to pronounce Damnation againſt the Organs and Singing-Men, for they are all, ſaith he, the Limbs of <hi>Antichriſt</hi>: He whiſpers Damnation againſt theſe Idolaters that bow before a Piece of Bread; for they look as though they worſhipped the Hoſt, and belonged to <hi>Rome.</hi> He is very poſitive that ſitting is a Poſture of abſolute Neceſſity in that Ordinance, for <hi>Jeſus</hi> and his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples <hi>did ſit and eat,</hi> Mark xiv. 8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 20. and ſince it is called the <hi>Supper of the Lord,</hi> we muſt ſit down while we partake of it, for every Child knows that Men are never wont to kneel at Supper.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, <hi>Genicola</hi> hates the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> for their ſcandalous Irreverence at the Sacrament: <q>What, ſaith he, dare any Man uſe to clowniſh and
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:006440_0271_1028F1CF77329D80"/>
ſo rude a Geſture as ſitting, when he receives the Seal of the Pardon of his Sins, and the Emblems of the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi>?</q> and he forbids all ſuch Worſhippers from his Communion with this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, <hi>Procul, O procul eſte, profani</hi>; i. e. <hi>hence ye pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Creatures,</hi> though he can hardly pretend to bring one Text of Scripture for his own Practice: He is ſure alſo that the Surplice, a Sign or Token of Purity, and as our Reformers teach, ought to be worn at Prayer, for we muſt lift up Hands of Purity and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence when we come before God; and he finds the long white Garment in theſe Words, <hi>Let all things be done decently and in order,</hi> 1 Cor. xiv. 40.</p>
               <p>To me, ſaith <hi>Piſcopion,</hi> 'tis as clear as the Light, that no Man can be a Miniſter of Chriſt unleſs the Hands of a ſuperior Man, even a <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Biſhop, have been upon his Head; and all the Preachings and Miniſtrings of ſuch a preſumptuous Wretch, who was not thus ordained, are but vain Babblings, empty Trifles, and impudent Uſurpations in the Name of the Lord: For thus ſaith the Common Prayer Book, which was made by Saints and Martyrs, <hi>It is evident unto all Men, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently reading holy Scripture and ancient Authors, that from the Apoſtles time there have been theſe Orders of Miniſters in Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Church; Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons.</hi> Thus he proceeds triumphant where the Civil Government is on his Side, and will yield to no Man in Argument or Diſpute.</p>
               <p>Claſſicus ariſes in warm Oppoſition to Prelacy, and aſſerts it an indiſputable Truth, that no Miniſter of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſuperior to another: <q>I read, ſaith he, in my Bible, no Diſtinction between Biſhops and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; they are the ſame Officers in Scripture; And the Power of Synods is ſo plainly inſtituted at the Council of <hi>Jeruſalem, Acts</hi> xv. that I am amazed this ſhould be eſteemed a matter of Doubt or Difficulty;
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:006440_0272_1028F1D1141B4B08"/>
and I am well aſſured of this, becauſe <hi>Timothy</hi> had the Hands of the Presbytery laid upon him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> iv. 14. there is no Man above or below a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter has any thing to do in ordaining Miniſters ſince the Apoſtles are dead.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antipas</hi> grows impatient at theſe bold Aſſertions, and aſſerts with as much Boldneſs, that the Power of ordaining all Sorts of Officers in the Church belongs properly to the Brethren of a ſingle Congregation, and none beſides have any Authority to meddle with it, ſince the Race of inſpired Men are dead and gone: The Brethren have all the Power in their Hands, and 'tis the Church or Congregation alone that has any Manner of Right to chuſe and approve and eſtabliſh its own Paſtors, Elders, Overſeers and Deacons: For is it not ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> vi. 3. <hi>Look you out among you ſeven Men,</hi> &amp;c. And if this be done at the Choice of <hi>Deacons,</hi> why not of <hi>Elders</hi> too? The Learned ſay, that the Word in <hi>Greek,</hi> which is uſed for ordaining of Elders, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the Choice or <hi>lifting up the Hands of the Brethren to vote for them.</hi> Whatſoever Particulars are diſputed in Church Government, the Power of the People muſt be ever acknowledged and received as a fundamental and immoveable Truth.</p>
               <p>Among all theſe Combatants there is not one but is ſo poſitive in his own Sentiments, that one would think they had received all their Opinions by Inſpiration, or that <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles had been preciſely of their Party, and had written their Opinions down in expreſs Letters and Syllables. And not only are they ſo aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of the Truth of their Tenets, but the vaſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of them too: And each of them grows angry that his own particular Opinion ſhould be reckoned among the leſs-evident or the leſs-important Points of Religion: Their Fury boils high, and their miſtaken Zeal and warm Ferment of their Paſſion ſwells every
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:006440_0273_1028F1D3A2A3C858"/>
Punctilio to a Mountain, and makes every Particle of their Opinions fundamental: They don't obſerve how their ſwift Career and Violence carries each of them beſides or beyond their Text, and thus they are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hurried on beſide the Goal of Truth, and I am perſwaded their Aſſurance always runs too faſt for their Evidence, and reaches far beyond it.</p>
               <p>They commend and practiſe <hi>Vehemence</hi> as a Virtue, and ſo far forget their Bible as to believe all <hi>Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to be a mere Spirit of Indifference, and unworthy of a good Chriſtian. They all maintain oppoſite No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet by their Temper and Conduct they all ſeem to approve each other's Zeal for his own Party, and with one Conſent they vote me a mere Latitudinarian, a lukewarm Profeſſor, a Citizen of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> who has not a Spark of Zeal for the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Worſhip or the Diſcipline of his Church.</p>
               <p>My dear zealous Friends, be calm a little, and let me ſpeak before I'm condemned. I do not deny many of theſe Things which I call <hi>leſs-important</hi> to be ſome Way diſcovered in the New Teſtament, though not in ſo expreſs and plain Language as you ſuppoſe. The chief Concerns of the Chriſtian Church are ſo far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by poſitive Rules, by Examples or juſt Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, that a ſerious Reader, who is attentive and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byaſſed, and who will exerciſe his reaſoning Powers, may find ſufficient Notices of all neceſſary Truth and Duty: According to my Meaſure of Light I humbly hope I have found it, and thereby regulate my Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</p>
               <p>But ſtill it muſt be granted, that Things leſs neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary are not ſo plainly deſcribed as the bigger and more ſubſtantial Parts of Religion, nor graven in Characters ſo large and obvious that every one muſt needs diſcern them. <hi>Chriſt Jeſus hath been as faithful in his Houſe as Moſes was,</hi> and has delineated the Form, Pattern and
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:006440_0274_1028F1D5387FC690"/>
Order of it, ſo far as infinite Wiſdom thought neceſſary to carry on the grand Deſigns of Grace and the Goſpel: But ſome of the leſſer Pins in this ſpiritual Tabernacle are not ſo graphically decyphered, as that every Child may tell whether they muſt be round or ſquare. There is nothing of ſo much Weight depends upon them, and therefore there was no need for them to be ſo expreſly deſcribed under the New Teſtament, wherein <hi>bodily Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe profits little,</hi> but Worſhip and Religion conſiſt more in what is ſpiritual and inviſible.<note n="*" place="bottom">See the Eſſay on the <hi>Reaſons why the Worſhip of Chriſtian Churches is not ſo particularly preſcribed as the Jewiſh,</hi> which you may find in the Treatiſe about the <hi>Holineſs of Times, Places and Perſons.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the whole then, ſince there are different De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Evidence and Clearneſs, wherewith ſome of the Doctrines of Faith, and the Rules of Worſhip and Order in the New Teſtament are expreſt, there ought alſo to be found in us different Degrees of Aſſent or Aſſurance, wherewith we ſhould receive theſe Doctrines or theſe Rules of Duty: For it is a certain and eternal Rule of <hi>Logic</hi> or <hi>Reaſon,</hi> that <hi>our Aſſent to any Propoſition ought to be firm or feeble, juſt in Proportion to the different Degrees of Evidence, whether they be brighter or more obſcure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here then is a plain and pretty general Rule given us, whereby we may judge whether any particular Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or Practice be more or leſs important, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently whether our Zeal for it ſhould be warmer or cooler, <hi>viz.</hi> Is the Evidence of this Practice, or this Truth in Scripture more bright or cloudy? According to the Light of Evidence, ſuch generally ſhould our Zeal be. Violence and fierce Contention among Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, eſpecially about Matters of leſſer Moment, or of doubtful Diſpute, are infinitely ſcandalous to the Chriſtian Name; and as they tend to ruin and deſtroy the

               <p>If it would not offend my Readers, I would here come to an ingenuous Confeſſion, that the different Sentiments and dreadful Quarrels of Chriſtians about ſome of the leſſer Things of Religion, and the dark and dubious Expreſſions in Scripture, wherein ſome Parts of our Religion are revealed, have ſometimes been a ſore Temptation and Sorrow to my Heart, ſo that I have wiſh'd theſe doubtful Diſputables had been more clearly determined there. I have been plunged into the Briars of this Perplexity, when I have ſeen Perſons of devout Soul, ſerious and humble, diſſent ſo widely from each other, both in Opinion and Practice, and that in Matters of ſome Moment too, and even after long and honeſt Enquiries into the Meaning of God in his Word.</p>
               <p>Under theſe Difficulties I have ſaid in my Heart, <q>Why did not the God of Wiſdom and of Love ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs every Article of Belief and Duty in Words of plaineſt Revelation and Precept, that we might have all read the ſame Senſe, and been all of one Mind? Why did he leave the leaſt Point of our Religion dubious or obſcure, when, with a long Foreſight, he ſurveyed all the Quarrels and Rage, the infinite Scandal, the Cruelty and the Blood that in future Ages would be the Conſequences of Religious Diſputes?</q>
               </p>
               <p>I have been pain'd at my Soul, and felt an inward
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:006440_0276_1028F1DC16C72570"/>
afflicting Heavineſs in ſuch a Meditation as this; nor could I ever ſatisfy myſelf with that prophane Anſwer which ſome witty Men have given, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>That God, who might have made the Rules of our Duty plain and undiſputed, choſe to expreſs them in Words ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſeveral Interpretations, that Chriſtians might be liable to be led into many different Opinions, that hereby God might pleaſe himſelf with the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Devotions that were paid him; and that how different ſoever their Sentiments and Practices might be, yet that his Commands are equally obey'd by all the various Kinds of Worſhip and Service, which the Conſciences of Men ſincerely conceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bound to offer.</q> This Notion inclines to that wild Opinion, which ſuppoſes that any Forms or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Worſhip are all equally acceptable to God, and that there are more true Religions than one: This ſavours ſo much of the <hi>Deiſt</hi> and the <hi>Libertine,</hi> and the Diſciples of the <hi>Leviathan,</hi> that I could never admit it into my Aſſent.</p>
               <p>Yet it muſt be granted that his Wiſdom had ſome very valuable Ends to attain in the Way of Providence, by permitting ſo many Differences amongſt Chriſtians; and if we had been Secretaries to the King of Heaven when he form'd his Decrees, we might have known per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome of theſe awful <hi>Arcana</hi> of his Government; but who has been his Counſellor, or to whom has he given an Account of theſe Matters? His Paths are in the great Deep, and his Providences are trackleſs through the mighty Waters; <hi>how unſearchable are his Ways, and his Judgments paſt finding out!</hi> I dare not pretend to write a compleat <hi>Rationale</hi> on all his infinite and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrable Deſigns; yet my Faith aſſures me that they have all the higheſt and divine Reaſon in them. And I will take the Freedom here to mention ſome of thoſe Conſiderations that have ſilenced my clamorous
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:006440_0277_1028F1DE92C51D60"/>
Thoughts, pleaſed my Enquiry, ſatisfied my Conſcience, and vanquiſhed the dark Temptation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> By theſe doubtful Diſputables among the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Things of Religion, God tries our Sincerity, whether we will hold faſt the Subſtantials. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and Courage of a Soul devoted to God is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed and proved amidſt the Clamours and noiſy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts of the Men of Party and angry Zeal; and when it perſevereth in a Courſe of Chriſtianity, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all theſe Stumbling Blocks, it approves itſelf to God, its Judge and Rewarder. The Differences of true Chriſtians in ſome Parts of their Faith and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, have frighted and ſcandaliz'd the Hypocrite and the giddy Profeſſor; their Heads have been turned round with every Wind of Doctrine, becauſe their Hearts have not been eſtabliſhed in the Way of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; they have caſt off all the Articles and Practices of Religion, becauſe they find ſo many Sects divided by their little Particularities, and cannot preciſely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine every Circumſtance of Truth and Duty.</p>
               <p>There were Diviſions and Parties, Schiſms and Sects in the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Church, <hi>and they muſt be,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>that they that are approved may be made manifeſt among you,</hi> 1 Cor. xi. 19. <hi>Our Lord Jeſus</hi> forewarns his Diſciples, <hi>that Offences will come,</hi> and 'tis not poſſible that it ſhould be otherwiſe; <hi>there ſhall be Variance</hi> and Strife <hi>in a Man's own Houſhold: But bleſſed is he who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall not be offended in me; he that perſevereth to the end the ſame ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Luke xvii. 1. Matt. xi. 6. There are many things in the Chriſtian Religion that <hi>become Stones of ſtumbling, and Rocks of Offence; bleſſed are the upright that hold on</hi> their Courſe and Reſolution for Heaven, and whoſe Feet <hi>ſtumble not upon theſe dark Mountains,</hi> becauſe of their Neglect to ſearch out the Truth, or their wilful Obſtinacy in dangerous Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Not only our Sincerity towards God, but our Charity towards fellow-Chriſtians is hereby put to the Trial, and Charity is the very Livery of the Diſciples of <hi>Chriſt.

The Lord hath commanded all his Sheep to wear this Mark of Diſtinction from the World, how different ſoever their leſſer Opinions are among themſelves. Where I behold the Image of <hi>Chriſt</hi> my Lord ſtampt in legible Characters upon my Neighbour, can I love him with warm Affection, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hough he never frequents the ſame Place of Worſhip with me, though he wears a Garment of another Shape and Colour, prays in a ſett Form of Words which I cannot perfectly approve, and ſubſcribes a Creed of different Expreſſions, though the ſame in Senſe and Meaning? Can I receive this good Man into my very Soul, who eats nothing but Herbs, and will not ſit down at my Table becauſe Fleſh is eaten there? Can I love him at my Heart that loves <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Lord, though he will not religiouſly obſerve the Feſtival of his Birth or Aſcenſion? Or do thoſe little Words <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> and <hi>Holy Thurſday</hi> ſet my Heart at a Diſtance from him, and make him forfeit all my Charity? Such Queries as theſe may be a Touch-Stone of our Graces, and the Teſt of true Love to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Saints.</p>
               <p>There ſeems to be ſomething of this Deſign in our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> when he ordered his Servant <hi>Paul</hi> to write the fourteenth Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> where the Apoſtle, though he gives a Hint of his own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Liberty in the Goſpel, with regard to Meats and Days, yet he doth not impoſe the ſame Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Abſtinences on other Chriſtians; and though he was inſpired, yet he leaves theſe things ſtill indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, and calls them <hi>doubtful Diſputations.</hi> Now as the <hi>Trial of our Faith,</hi> through manifold Temptations,
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:006440_0279_1028F1E2C62F1970"/>
                  <hi>is much more precious than that of Gold that periſhes,</hi> ſo the Trial of our Love paſſing through the ſmoaky Fires of Contention and Diſpute, and not mingling therewith, is diſcovered to be a pure divine Flame, <hi>and ſhall be found to Praiſe, Honour and Glory at the appearing of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>whom having not ſeen we love,</hi> 1 Pet. i. 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Perhaps our Lord might leave ſome leſſer Points of Religion more obſcurely expreſſed in his Word, becauſe he deſigned to continue a Miniſtry in his Church to the End of the World, or till he came again. While other Chriſtians have their Hours and Thoughts engroſſed by the Cares of this Life, and want Leiſure and Skill and Means to acquaint them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with all the difficult and more abſtruſe Parts of Religion, 'tis the Buſineſs of the Men that are honoured and employed in the ſacred Office to <hi>give themſelves to Reading,</hi> to ſearch into the hidden Things of God, and explain the more doubtful Paragraphs of his Word unto Men.</p>
               <p>I grant that the firſt and grand Deſign of their Studies and public Labours ſhould be to preach the Goſpel of the Grace of God and Reconciliation by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and to make the neceſſary Articles of Faith and Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice plain to the meaneſt Soul: But a Miniſter is alſo required to converſe not only with thoſe Scriptures which will make <hi>him wiſe to</hi> final <hi>Salvation, but</hi> with thoſe alſo which may <hi>throughly furniſh him to every good</hi> Word and <hi>Work,</hi> 2 Tim. iii. 17. that he may <hi>know how to ſpeak a Word in Seaſon to every weary Soul,</hi> and to draw Conſciences out of Perplexity which are vexed with Scruples of leſs important Things; to inſtruct them in the Mind and Will of <hi>Chriſt</hi> about the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of his Worſhip, and the Order of his Church, <hi>to ſhew them the Pattern</hi> and Faſhion <hi>of the Houſe of God, and all the Ordinances,</hi> and the Forms and the Laws <hi>thereof</hi>: And that is a Part of his Duty, at proper
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:006440_0280_1028F1E608FC79E0"/>
Seaſons, in ſome of his public Miniſtrations; for he muſt <hi>conceal nothing of the Counſel of God</hi> from them, that may be uſeful or profitable to Men: The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of his Worſhip, and Inſtitutions of his Goſpel, ſhould be treaſured up in his Heart; and upon proper Occaſions, of private Viſit and Conference, <hi>the Lips of the Prieſt</hi> ſhould make it appear that they <hi>keep Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> that <hi>the Law may be ſought at his Mouth, for he is the Meſſenger of the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> Mal. ii. 7.</p>
               <p>Not that every Man is bound to pay an implicit Faith and blind Obedience to the Opinions and Dictates of his Biſhop or Presbyter. This is Popiſh Slavery whereſoever it is practiſed, and Popiſh Tyranny where it is commanded: But Chriſtians ought to give due Attention to the Advice and Counſel <hi>of ſuch as are ſet over them in the Lord,</hi> Heb. xiii. 17. 1 Cor. xvi. 15, 16. Such as are ſolemnly devoted to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the Goſpel, and have addicted themſelves to the Study and Search of the Scriptures, and are choſen by the People to be their Teachers, and ſet apart for that Office in the Way they beſt approve; and ſo far as their Advice is conformable to the written Word, they are to receive it as from ſome of the Meſſengers of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may humbly ſuppoſe a <hi>fourth</hi> Deſign which God had in his Eye when the ſacred Penmen wrote ſo many Verſes of Holy Scripture, which God knew were ſo difficult to be interpreted; and that is, that no Chriſtian might put the Bible out of his own Hands, or neglect to read and meditate and ſtudy the Word of God; and that together with their Reading they might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly implore the Preſence of the Spirit, the Enlightner and the Comforter, to lead them into all Truth. It is the Duty of every Man, ſo far as his Capacity and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of Life will admit, to ſtudy the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures himſelf, and to ſee with his own Eyes what he muſt believe, and what he muſt practiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="266" facs="unknown:006440_0281_1028F1E794976490"/>We ſhould imitate the Example of the noble <hi>Bereans,</hi> Acts xvii. 11. <hi>who ſearched the Scriptures</hi> with Diligence, and brought the Sermons of <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf unto that ſacred Touch-ſtone, to ſee if the Things which he ſpoke were true or no: And after all our Study, we ſhall find ſuch Difficulties that will convince us of the Neceſſity of depending upon a higher Teacher, even the Holy Spirit. Our bleſſed Saviour commands that we ſearch the Scriptures, and pray for the Spirit too, <hi>John</hi> v. 39. <hi>Luke</hi> xi. 9, 13. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> prays unto God that he would give to the Saints which were at <hi>Epheſus, that Spirit of Wiſdom and Revelation to enlighten the Eyes of their Underſtanding,</hi> Epheſ. i. 17. <hi>this Unction which</hi> true Believers <hi>have from the Holy One, makes known to them all Things</hi> neceſſary to Salvation, 1 <hi>John</hi> ii. 20. And though we have no Ground to expect that he will unfold to us every leſſer Difficulty, while we live in this World; yet we may humbly hope that in thoſe Things which regard the Forms of his own Worſhip, and the Means of his own viſible Glory amongſt Men, he will by Degrees let ſome divine Rays of Light into the Mind of him that ſeeks after Truth with great Diligence, fervent Prayer, and more ſincere Deſigns. There are many Inſtances to be given of plain Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians that have been made the Favourites of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning Spirit, and have arrived at uncommon Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in Chriſtianity by theſe Methods.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Fifth</hi> bleſſed End, and which is certainly attained in the Providence of God, by leaving ſo many Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables in Religion, is, that our Souls are hereby drawn out to long for Heaven, and pant after the State where there is no Contention, no Diſpute. This Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect renders thoſe happy Regions more deſireable whilſt we are here, and more abundantly welcome here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>

                  <pb n="267" facs="unknown:006440_0282_1028F1EA328EEEA0"/>It is impoſſible that any Controverſy ſhould there ariſe to interrupt the Worſhip of the Church trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant. It is eternally impoſſible to divide them into Parties, or to diſturb their Repoſe. The Doctrines of their Profeſſion are all written as with Sun-Beams, they are no longer the Articles of Faith, but the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Sight: <hi>We ſhall be all taught of God, we ſhall ſee Face to Face, and know as we are known.</hi> So much of the Holy Spirit dwells in all the Saints, as a perpetual Spring of Revelation and Wiſdom. The Diſcipline of that Church can occaſion no Diſputes, for the Son of God, in our Nature, is the Paſtor or Biſhop, he keeps the Keys of Heaven in his own Hands, and the Keys of Hell and Death. The Soul that is once admitted into that Fellowſhip ſhall abide like a <hi>Pillar in the Temple of his God, and ſhall go no more out;</hi> but the Hypocrite and the Unclean ſhall never enter there. The Worſhip that is paid there is with perfect Uniformity of Mind and Affection amongſt all the happy Spirits; an una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous Conſent in Self-abaſement, divine Honour and Love; and perhaps when our Bodies ſhall be raiſed again to make a viſible Church in Heaven, Worſhip may be perform'd with a glorious Liberty, and with ſuch a pleaſing Variety of Form as glorified Nature ſhall dictate, and our exalted Reaſon approve; but ſtill with the Exerciſe of the ſame perfect Love and Delight among the Worſhippers, and under the Influence of the ſame Spirit.</p>
               <p>O the Happineſs of that upper Region, where all the Inhabitants are of one Mind and one Heart!

the ſame Light, and therefore our Sentiments, at leaſt in Things of Importance, ſhall differ no more; we ſhall be united to each other in the ſame Band of Love, nor can our Affections be ſeparated any more for ever: That Light and that Love ſprings from the ever-bleſſed God; God the Creator communicating himſelf to all his holy and happy Creation, and holding them faſt to himſelf for ever, in and by that glorious Perſon <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> his Son and Image; for <hi>in him</hi> muſt <hi>all Things be gathered together in one, and all Things reconciled unto God in him, whether they be Things in Earth or Things in Heaven</hi>; then ſhall the Prophecy of <hi>Zechariah</hi> be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, <hi>The Lord ſhall be King over all the Earth, there ſhall be one Lord, and his Name one,</hi> in the fulleſt Meaning of that Expreſſion; nor ſhall the Saints be diſtinguiſhed by different Parties or Denominations, but their Hearts and their Names ſhall be all one; according to thoſe Expreſſions of unconceivable Glory, wherein our Lord deſcribes the things which are truly unſpeakable, all the Saints <hi>ſhall be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us,</hi> John xvii. 21.</p>

            <p>GIVE me Leave, my dear Friend, to make a chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Apology for honeſt and upright Souls, who maintain a ſtrict Courſe of Piety and Virtue, and yet appear to be unalterably determined for or againſt the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> upon very ſlight and feeble Grounds: Perhaps we ſhall learn Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to the Weakneſſes of our fellow Chriſtians, if you and I together meditate on theſe following Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Let us take a Survey how many are the Circumſtances and various Occurrences of human Life, which do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times powerfully determine the Opinions even of good and ſober Men, to one or the other ſide of this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, whether they ſhall fix their Communion in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or amongſt thoſe who ſeparate from it.</p>
            <p>Here the firſt thing that naturally occurs, is the <hi>Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of different Perſons,</hi> which has a mighty Influence to form their Opinions, and to fix their Practice; and this, it muſt be confeſs'd, is not in a Man's own Choice: the Providence of the great and bleſſed God, the Over-ruler
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:006440_0286_1028F21DF190B498"/>
of all things, determines this Affair in a wiſe and holy manner, whatever the final Event may be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jonathan</hi> goes to worſhip every Lord's Day where his Father goes, and as the Child was never led to hear a Sermon at a publick Church, ſo the Youth grows up in a groundleſs Averſion to it, and the Man ſtands at a wider Diſtance, and can hardly be perſwaded to venture in.</p>
            <p>By Uſe and Cuſtom from his very Childhood, he underſtands the Methods of the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> Worſhip, and the Terms that are uſed in their Sermons; and if by any ſtrange Occaſion he is led to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> he finds no Profit by hearing a Clergyman preach, for he does not clearly take in the Expreſſions and the Meaning; and it muſt be acknowledged, many of them have a different way of managing the Word of God in their Explications of it, different Phraſes and Modes of Expreſſion, and too many of them preach Doctrines different from their own Articles and our common Faith; theſe things are ſhocking and offenſive to the Ear, rather than inſtructive or edifying to a new Hearer.</p>
            <p>Beſides, <hi>Jonathan</hi> has imbibed long Prejudices againſt the Modes of Worſhip and Ceremonies of the Church, the Forms, the Geſtures, the Veſtments, the Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and his Soul is thereby mightily unfitted for Edification by the Prayers of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> that are mingled and interwoven with them; his Palate is ſo much diſguſted with this ſort of Entertainment before hand, that he either diſreliſhes or neglects what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſolid and wholeſome Food is ſet before him in the Sermon that follows: I will not ſay, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this Folly owing to the Influences of his Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; but it is hard, if not impoſſible, to amend or
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:006440_0287_1028F222305ECC18"/>
prevent all the Faults of this kind in the Education of Children, by the beſt and wiſeſt of Parents.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Since I have Occaſion, in this Place, to mention the <hi>Education of Children,</hi> amongſt Perſons of the <hi>Eſtabliſh'd Church,</hi> and thoſe that have <hi>ſeparated from it,</hi> I could ſcarce excuſe it to my own Conſcience, if I ſhould neglect to make this <hi>ſolemn Remark</hi> on both (<hi>viz.</hi>) that there is ſomething very dangerous that is early impreſſed on the Minds of Children of the one Party and the other, and they unhappily learn it from the different reſpective Catechiſms in which they are inſtructed.</p>
                  <p>The Children who are educated in the <hi>Church of England,</hi> as ſoon as they have learnt to anſwer <hi>what is their Name?</hi> they are immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately told in the next Anſwer, that in their Baptiſm, <hi>They are made the Members of Chriſt, the Children of God,</hi> and <hi>inheritors of the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> This ariſes from the Doctrine they are generally taught, that Baptiſm and Regeneration are much the ſame thing, or that all Men are regenerated by being baptiſed; whereas in Scripture, Baptiſm is but an Emblem and Repreſentation of ſuch a Change of the Heart, as Regeneration requires and implies; and for want of this Diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Children uſually grow up through all their Stations in Life, without enquiring whether they have had any ſuch real Change in their Souls, as includes in it Repentance for Sin, and a turn of Soul towards God and Godlineſs, whereby a Man is born again and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a new Creature.</p>
                  <p>And this neceſſary Change, upon which the Favour of God, and an Intereſt in the Salvation of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the Kingdom of Heaven depend, is very groſly and ſhamefully neglected by them through their whole Lives, they always ſuppoſing, as they have been taught, that all this Work is done in Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>And for this Reaſon many Divines of the Church of <hi>England</hi> have heartily wiſhed that either theſe Words in the Catechiſm were a little altered, or that this Anſwer ſhould never be taught to Children without explaining the Meaning of it.</p>
                  <p>Among the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> one Part of the Education is uſually learning the Catechiſm written <hi>by the Aſſembly of Divines at Weſtminſter.</hi> Now in the 19th Anſwer it is ſaid, <hi>That all Mankind by their Fall, are under the Wrath and Curſe of God,</hi> and <hi>ſo made liable to all the Miſeries in this Life, to Death itſelf,</hi> and <hi>to the Pains of Hell for ever</hi>: And ſome Perſons have been ſo groſly unwiſe, as to aſſert under this Influence, that there are Children of a Span long ſuffering the Vengeance of God in Hell, for their Intereſt in the Sin of <hi>Adam.</hi> Now the very Hint of ſuch a Notion frights Children terribly, and while they are required to love God with all their Hearts, it gives them a very terrible and cruel Notion of the great and bleſſed God, who has ordain'd young Children to theſe everlaſting Torments for the Sin of <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are ſome that deny this Anſwer, and renounce this Doctrine roundly.</p>
                  <p>Indeed there is one Author that has endeavoured to explain it in a moderate way, and to make a juſt Diſtinction upon this Subject, and that is in the laſt Queſtion of a Book called the <hi>Ruin and Recovery of Mankind.</hi> There it is ſhewn that all good Chriſtians by their Faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are become the Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that they and their infant Children have an Intereſt in the Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gal. iii. 26.29. (<hi>viz.</hi>) that <hi>God would be their God, and the God of their Seed,</hi> which gives abundant Hope for the Children of good Parents dying in Infancy, that they are tranſlated to the Bleſſedneſs of Heaven, and the Hope of a joyful Reſurrection by the <hi>Covenant of Abraham.</hi> And it is the Children of the Wicked, who have never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of the Covenant of Grace, are left under the Curſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> of temporal Death, which <hi>Adam</hi> had incurred for himſelf and his Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, and that without any Prediction or Promiſe of any Reſurrection at all. Now I ſpeak of thoſe who never ſinned actually, nor enjoyed a State of perſonal Trial for themſelves in this World. <hi>See the original Writer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When theſe things will be corrected in the Education of Children, of the one Side or the other, it is only the Providence of God can determine.</p>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="273" facs="unknown:006440_0288_1028F224B73F99B8"/>Theſe Things joined together, put a ſtrong Biaſs upon the Judgment of the Man, and it is exceeding difficult to be removed; and 'tis evident that his Prayers, his Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in Religion, his ſecret Acts of Devotion, are all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by the Inſtructions he has received from his Parents or ſome of his Teachers: This makes his Spirit grow uneaſy under ceremonious Forms, and he is quite untun'd for Devotion by the very Sound of the Organ. Theſe Things muſt needs have a mighty Force on the Minds of young ſincere Creatures beginning their Courſe of Religion and Chriſtianity, to eſtabliſh them in the <hi>Nonconformiſt</hi> Way.</p>
            <p>And I might alſo add, how rude and indecent a Thing the plain and natural Worſhip of the Diſſenters appears
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:006440_0289_1028F2264D74A808"/>
to one, that has been bred up to Ornament and Ceremony in the ſeveral Parts of Worſhip in the eſtabliſh'd Church.</p>
            <p>By Education and Cuſtom, a particular Form of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is ſo mingled with their Nature, and wrought into their Conſtitution, that you might as ſoon alter their Palate, and change their Taſte of Meats, as you can perſwade their Souls to diſlike the Miniſtry under which they have been brought up, and to forſake the Mode of Worſhip to which they have been trained. They are ſo poſitive they are in the right, that they never had any Thought of calling theſe Things to a new Examination.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Prejudice of the Mind in favour of the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> grows yet ſtronger, if <hi>Jonathan</hi> has found his Soul awakened to a Fear of Hell, and been effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually convinced of Sin by the Terrors of the Law under the Preaching of ſome <hi>Boanerges,</hi> ſome Son of Thunder in a Meeting-houſe; and has been afterwards led gently into the Knowledge of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the Saviour, and has been taught to apply himſelf unto him for Salvation by humble Faith.</p>
            <p>If the Spirit of God has made the Preaching of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Grace, by a Diſſenting Miniſter, effectual to claim the Surges of his troubled Conſcience, and to lead him the Way of Peace and Holineſs towards Heaven, perhaps he feels his Paſſions refined, his ſinful Appetites mortified, his Temper changed from earthly and carnal, to ſpiritual and heavenly, how naturally will his whole Soul be carried out to love this Miniſtry? and he would not willingly abſent himſelf one Day from the Teachings of this <hi>Barnabas,</hi> this Son of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation; he deſpiſes all the finer Flouriſhes of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, he can take no Pleaſure in the more polite, and perhaps more argumentative Diſcourſe of a Doctor or a Biſhop in the <hi>Church of England;</hi> but where he

has found Light and Food, and Reſt for his dark and diſtreſſed and hungry Soul, thither he will go conſtantly to Worſhip, and he calls that the Sanctuary of the Lord, without once enquiring whether a Pariſh Church may not be the Sanctuary of the Lord too; nay per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps his Paſſion for the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> may riſe ſo high as to deny the Preſence of God in the Aſſemblies of the eſtabliſh'd Church, or to allow very little of it there.</p>
            <p>And by the ſame falſe Method of Reaſoning may a Churchman, whoſe Soul has been brought to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Holineſs by the Miniſtry of the public Church, on which he has attended, almoſt hate the Name of a Nonconformiſt, and ſeverely inveigh againſt them all as Sciſmatics and fooliſh Teachers, when perhaps he never ventur'd into a Meeting-houſe, nor heard one Sermon in any of their Aſſemblies.</p>
            <p>So far is it poſſible for Piety, Ignorance and Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to meet in the ſame Mind: But our God, who knows the Frame of human Nature, looks down and pities and forgives. A hearty Tendency towards God, and a Purſuit of Heaven is well-pleaſing in his Sight; though perhaps the Traveller, through Ignorance, takes many a wrong Step, and performs many a Duty not exactly conformable to the Directions of the Word.</p>
            <p>Now, though this Argument be ſufficient to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine him to be a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> in Oppoſition to other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, becauſe other Religions have not this Power to ſanctify him, yet it ought not to be ſufficient for ever to determine him to a particular Party of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, becauſe it was not the particular Opinions of that Party, but the ſubſtantial and great Doctrines of Chriſtianity or the Goſpel, which are profeſſed and pretended to by both Parties, that were ſo powerful to the turning of his Heart towards God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="276" facs="unknown:006440_0291_1028F22AAF3F90D8"/>After all this Diſcourſe, I would not be underſtood as though I encouraged this Lazineſs of Men, and Neglect of due and juſt Reaſoning; no, for Reaſon is the Talent that God hath given to be uſed in the Affairs of Religion, and he hath given us the Rule of his own Word for our Determination, by which all our Worſhip ought to be regulated, and not by human Inventions; and Men are highly guilty in their Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect hereof: But a gracious God will forgive, for he knows our Frame and our Frailty.</p>
            <p>I believe God doth accept of ſuch inward, ſincere and experimental Arguments as vulgar Chriſtians uſe to make or keep themſelves <hi>Churchmen</hi> or <hi>Diſſenters, Calviniſts</hi> or <hi>Arminians.</hi> If they feel their Souls raiſed to a more heavenly Frame, and effectually engaged to the Love of God, Religion and Juſtice, by attending occaſionally on a Miniſtry different from their Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſometimes they will be ready to ſeparate even from a true Church to which they belonged, for want of knowing the Guilt and Terrors and Damnation that ſome Men include in that hard Word, <hi>Schiſm;</hi> and I perſwade myſelf that a gracious God will accept of their upright Deſigns and their honeſt Motives, will pardon their Separation, though it ſhould prove un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable, and bleſs their new Communion to the Advantage of their Souls.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> But ſuppoſe a Man ſhould forcibly diveſt himſelf of all former Averſions and Inclinations to the ſeparate or the eſtabliſh'd Churches, and enter into a ſober Search, and ſolemn Debate with himſelf about the Merits of the Cauſe; how few are there, whoſe neceſſary Affairs of Life a low them Time enough to go through the Study of theſe laborious and intangled Controverſies? How ſmall a Part of Mankind that are born to ſecular Affairs, can, in their few Hours of Leiſure, find out the Depth of ſome of theſe Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?

Who is ſharp enough on the Sudden to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh Truth in the Midſt of the Clouds of Duſt that are caſt on it by the litigious Wrangle of all Parties?</p>
            <p>The Soul of many a Tradeſman is but juſt of a Size with his Shop and Buſineſs, and hath not Strength of Parts or Improvement to attain great and accurate Knowledge in any Thing beſides; and thoſe whoſe Ingenuity is greater, may eaſily waſte all the ſpare Hours of their Life in treading the Mazes of Diſpute about Forms and Ceremonies, and at laſt find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bewilder'd: Now I queſtion whether ſuch a Man's Head would lie eaſy upon a dying Pillow, who had ſpent his Time among Briars and Thorns, and neglected the Fruit of the Tree of Life, or taſted but very little of it; he has been dwelling upon the Moſs and the Ivy, and not gathered the Product of thoſe eminent Branches of our holy Religion, whence he might have extracted ſweet Cordials for a languiſhing and fainting Hour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly.</hi> Again, how very few are there amongſt the giddy Race of Men that can ſo far annihilate their old Opinions, and refrain ſo long from embracing new ones, till they have made a thorough Scrutiny into the Arguments and Pretenſions on both Sides? Who can dwell for Months together in the uneaſy State of Dubitation? Who is there that has Power enough over his own Thoughts, as to hold his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Suſpence for a conſiderable Seaſon, till the Matter in queſtion be fairly debated, and brought to an Iſſue in the Court of Reaſon and Scripture? How ready are we to incline our Aſſent one Way or another, as the various Occurrences of Life preſent Shadows of Argument for either Opinion? A Story of a wicked Clergyman of the Church will warp the enquiring Soul of a Plebeian towards a Meeting-houſe; and an old Song of <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr will determine another's

A Flaſh of Rhetoric, a Show of Reaſon, a warm Sermon, and Affections raiſed by a <hi>Tillotſon</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> or a <hi>Mead</hi> at <hi>Pinners-Hall,</hi> will immediately turn the Mind from its Equilibrium; and you know when a Balance is juſt turned, though it be but by a Grain of Weight, it falls effectually on that Side, and ſometimes almoſt irrecoverably too.</p>
            <p>When we have thrown off all old Prejudices, 'tis not eaſy to ſecure one's ſelf from new ones. When we have ſo far gained the Victory over Education and Cuſtom as to retain none of our ancient Opinions, we are apt to fall inſenſibly under the Power of the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Doctrines, and become Captives and Slaves to new Notions, merely becauſe they are new. Novelty is as great a Prejudice to fair Reaſoning as Antiquity; though perhaps not ſo univerſally prevailing. And there's many a giddy and headſtrong Youth that has haſtily embraced Maxims and Practices contrary to thoſe of his Parents, to ſhow how bravely he has broke all the Fetters of Education, and to make it appear that he thinks freely. When we puſh the Boat off from the Shore where it has long ſtuck in the Mud, 'tis hard to prevent its being ſtranded on the adverſe Side. 'Tis exceeding difficult to keep the Mind in this Medium of Suſpence till right Reaſon determine it; 'tis very troubleſome to maintain the Judgment in a Poiſe till ſome weighty and ſolid Argument ſink one of the Scales downward, and equitably decide the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending Strife of Opinions; there is Need of continual caution and wary Motions of Thought: A doubting Spirit is in Pain, and willing to be releaſed. We are very deſirous to believe ſomewhat, though upon ſlight Grounds, that our Souls may be at Eaſe, and fall to Practice.</p>

            <p>Turn your Eyes inward, my Friend, and behold a Soul there that has more Knowledge and Judgment than Hundreds of the Animals that are round about you, and that you are forced to converſe with; and yet after all your unbiaſſed Searches and Labours, and earneſt Prayers, how hard a Thing you find it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the Point, whether you ought to remain in the Communion of a Diſſenting Church, or become a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiſt from them, and unite yourſelf to the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Now, if all your Leiſure, your Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, and your Application, ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If I were to recapitulate theſe Things in ſhort, I would draw up my charitable Concluſion thus:</p>
            <p>Since our firſt Apoſtacy from God has ſo perverted and ſpoiled our rational Powers, and enſlaved our Minds to ſo many Prejudices and Paſſions; ſince the Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Education and Cuſtom are unavoidable and neceſſary, deep and ſtrong; ſince the Affairs of the World that is under a divine Curſe, are ſo juſtly and unhappily ill conſtituted; ſince Capacity, Leiſure, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, Humility, and Prayer, are all found together but in very few Perſons; and ſince the divine Oracles, in Matters leſs neceſſary, have ſo much Obſcurity in themſelves, and ſo much thicker Darkneſs caſt upon them by contending Parties, why ſhould we be ſo much amazed or ſo angry, to ſee ſo many different Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents and Practices amongſt Men of honeſt Piety, and deſirous of Truth?</p>
            <p>Farewel, thou dear Companion of my Studies, and if your Light and Knowledge ſhould be ſo far improved by your further Enquiries, as to lead you away from that Communion, and thoſe Methods of Worſhip wherein we have ſo often and ſo delightfully join'd; yet I hope that upon the Review of this Letter, you will maintain a very charitable Opinion of</p>
