            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

That the ſaid Decree being Confirmed, the <hi>India</hi> Company acquainted the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> that he might diſpoſe of his ſaid <hi>Tobaccoes,</hi> paying them their Freight and Charges; whereupon Monſ. <hi>Lawles,</hi> Ambaſſador of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> by orders from his Maſter, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted the Pretenſions of the <hi>India Company</hi> for Freight and Charges at 15365 Pieces of Eight and two Rials; and by his Letter dated the 6th of <hi>February,</hi> 1725.

Account of Charges and Commiſſions, he told them, <hi>It came to about Fourteen Hundred Pounds,</hi> but refuſed to ſhow them any Account for what, and told them, <hi>if it was not paid in three days, he would proteſt againſt them, and not deliver the Tobaccoes.</hi> Which behaviour in demanding of ſo great a Sum in ſo ſhort a time, and denying to ſhow for what, ſo contrary to the Cuſtom of fair Merchants, ſurprized the ſaid bearers, and brought them into a great ſtrait. That on the 25th day of <hi>November</hi> aforeſaid, the day inſiſted on for payment of the ſaid Sum, the bearers, in the preſence of the Notary, Counted out the ſaid Fourteen Hundred Pounds, to the Defendant <hi>Hett,</hi> who then did, and not till then would, ſhow his Account; the Ballance whereof amounted to 1397 <hi>l.</hi> 18 <hi>s.</hi> 3 <hi>d</hi> which Sum he then received and gave his Receipt for it.</p>
            <p>
               <label>V. Charge.</label>
The Bill further charges, that the Account is extravagant, falſe &amp; fraudulent, in the greateſt part of the Articles thereof. And that tho' three times as much as the Commiſſions due, were therein Charged, yet no ſooner he Received the ſaid Sum, but he trumped up a new pretence, and ſhowed a Bond of 1500 <hi>l.</hi> with condition to pay Five Pounds for every Hundred Pounds worth of Snuff he ſhould deliver, to be computed at the rate of Eleven Pence <hi>per</hi> Pound, tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, they muſt execute that or they ſhould have no Snuff, but if they would, they might begin to weigh to morrow, whereupon the bearers executed alſo that Bond.</p>
            <p>
               <label>VI. Charge.</label>
That afterwards, the ſaid <hi>Hett</hi> delivered to the bearers 1691 Bags of Snuff, great and ſmall, damaged and undamaged, weighing 315400 <hi>l.</hi> and a half, 101 Rolls of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> weighing 10412 <hi>l.</hi> and no more, as by the deputy Weigh-Maſters Certificate appears, and then ſaid, he had no more to deliver, when by his Account to the <hi>India Company,</hi> there remained undelivered 307 bags of Snuff, weighing 64424½ <hi>Pounds,</hi> 3875 <hi>Pounds</hi> of <hi>Tobacco</hi> in Roll, and 9628 <hi>Pounds</hi> in Leaf <hi>Tobacco,</hi> and upwards, which he ſtill denyed to deliver, and therefore on the 9th of <hi>March</hi> there-after, the bearers, in the preſence of the Notary, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it of him, and upon his denyal, proteſted, according to the Cuſtom of Merchants, in the like caſe.</p>

               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:003019_0009_0FEFA0AE41D373F8"/>Therefore, and for that the Complainants could have no Remedy herein at Law, being matters of Fraud and Diſcovery, they prayed the aid of this Court to Compel the Defendants to a Diſcovery of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes, by Anſwer upon Oath, and to produce the Books of Accounts that were kept of the ſaid Tobaccoes, and to come to a fair Account, &amp; deliver up the ſaid Bond and the Snuff remaining in their hands, and that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainants might have ſuch other and farther Relief as is agreeable to Equity and good Conſcience.</p>
            <p>And farther prayed, a Warrant of Injunction to ſtay Proceedings at Law on the ſaid Bond, and a ſubpoena to appear and anſwer the Premiſſes. Which being granted, and the Defendants ſerved there-with, they appeared, and on the 25th of <hi>October,</hi> 1726. they were ordered to Anſwer the Premiſſes in eight Days, according to the courſe of the Court; which time being expired, at the prayer of the Defendants, further time was granted them, by the favour of the Court, until the 12th Day of <hi>December,</hi> there-after. At which time the Defendants filed an Anſwer, Plea &amp; Demurrer to the ſaid Bill, which Plea and Demurrer came to Hearing on the third Day of <hi>February,</hi> there-after, when after hearing of the Arguments of the Council of both ſides, this Court did conceive the ſaid Plea &amp; Demurrer were not ſufficient to barr the Complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of Relief in the Premiſſes, and therefore over-ruled the ſame, ſaving to the Defendants nevertheleſs, any benefit they could make of their Plea at the hearing of the Cauſe.</p>
            <p>And the Complainants Excepted to the Anſwer, as Inſufficient, and Evading the Diſcovery of the matters prayed in the Bill to be Diſcovered, and delivered their Exceptions to the Defendants Clerk, ſetting forth the Points in which the ſame Anſwer was Inſufficient and Evaſive, in order for the Defendants to Anſwer to the points defective in Eight Days, according to the courſe of the Court; which time being elapſed, and no Anſwer to theſe Points put in, the Complainants <hi>Jacob De Lara</hi> and <hi>Manuel vaz de Coſta,</hi> on the 14th of <hi>February,</hi> made Oath to this purpoſe, <hi>That they came from</hi> England <hi>hither to receive the ſaid Tobaccoes, and that ever ſince</hi> October, 1725. <hi>they have been here without any other buſineſs, and have no other buſineſs here whatſoever, than the obtaining the ſaid Tobaccoes, and Juſtice in this Cauſe.</hi> And the Complainant <hi>Pacheco,</hi> made Oath, <hi>That he had preſſing Affairs in</hi> Europe, <hi>which required his Preſence there, and that he had put his Affairs in order here for Departure, Except only the obtaining the ſaid Tobaccos and Juſtice in this Cauſe.</hi> And the ſaid <hi>De Lara, De Coſta</hi> and <hi>Pacheco</hi> having, by their Petition (with Affidavits to the purpoſe aforeſaid, thereunto annexed) ſet forth to this Court, ſundry Cauſes that induced them to believe the Defendants affected delay in this Cauſe; That Delay of Juſtice in this cauſe, in their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, might prove as prejudicial to them, as the Denyal thereof: That great Delays were commonly uſed upon the References of Exceptions to Maſters, and therefore prayed that their Exceptions might be either heard by the Court without reference thereof, as ſometimes has been done to prevent Delays; Or that the Maſter, to whom they ſhould be referred, might have ſpecial Directions for Diſpatch. Which Petition and Affidavits were preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this Court on the 14th of <hi>February,</hi> the Defendants having been firſt ſerved with Copies thereof, and a Hearing on the Merits thereof, was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the 16th Day of the ſame Month: At which Day the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>rits of the ſaid Petition and Affidavits being fully argued and debated by Council of both ſides, this Court was of Opinion, that the Complainants Circumſtances in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled

               </gap>, their Exceptions ſhould be heard in Court without reference. But the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants Council admitting their firſt Anſwer not ſufficient, and denying any Intentions of Delay, and Promiſing to make a full and perfect Anſwer, if a Fortnights Time was allowed them for the doing thereof (the ſame being twice the time allowed for that purpoſe by the Courſe of the Court) which time being elapſed, at the Prayers of the Defendants, and further Promiſes of their Council, to make a full and perfect Anſwer, further times were allowed till the 20th Day of <hi>March,</hi> there-after, when the Defendants filed their ſecond Anſwer; to which the Complainants again excepted, as entirely Evaſive and Inſufficient. Which Exceptions, being delivered, and no Anſwer put in to the Points Excepted to, they, by Order, came to be heard in Court on the 5th Day of <hi>May,</hi> 1727. At which Day, upon arguing and Debating the ſame, by the Council of both ſides, this Court was of Opinion, That the ſaid Anſwer was very Evaſive and Inſufficient in many Points, and therefore ordered a further Anſwer to theſe Points. Which not being done in the Eight days (the time allowed for it by the courſe of the Court) and further favour of Time being conceived not due (the Circumſtances of the Complainants and long Times before granted on the firſt and ſecond Anſwers, being conſidered) the Defendants were in Contempt of the Court; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore on the 19th of the ſame Month of <hi>May,</hi> Attachments iſſued to take the Defendants for their Contempt: who on the firſt Day of <hi>June,</hi> 1727. filed their third Anſwer. Afterwards, on the ſame firſt Day of <hi>June,</hi> the Defendant <hi>Hett,</hi> by Affidavit, ſet forth, That he had diſcovered ſome failing in his ad Anſwer. That the <hi>Forty Bales of Snuff,</hi> the ſale of which Capt. <hi>D' Roſſel</hi> acknowledged to be juſt, and ſaid in the ſaid Anſwer, to be part of that for which Credit is given in the Defendants Account, was a miſtake, and that he believed it was that Sale of forty Bags ſold to pay Coll. <hi>Lurting</hi> his Store-Rent, before the Snuff was delivered to him and <hi>Freſneau,</hi> &amp; by Pitition, prayed leave to amend his ſecond Anſwer, by razing theſe words out of it (which is part of that for which Credit was given in this Defendants Account.) Wherupon it was Ordered, That the Prayer of the Petition be granted, unleſs cauſe ſufficient was ſhown on the 3d of <hi>June,</hi> to the contrary. At which day the ſaid Petition and Affidavit came to be argued, in preſence of the Council of both ſides, when the Council for the Complainants produced a Certificate under the hand of the ſaid Coll. <hi>Lurting,</hi> who is one of the Maſters of this Court, that only Twenty Four Bags had been ſold to pay his Store-Rent, and from thence concluded, that could not be the Sale of 40 Bags which <hi>D' Roſſel</hi> approved of. That <hi>D' Roſſel's</hi> Letter, by them produced, bearing date eight Months before the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Tobaccoes were acquitted by the Admiralty, acknowledging a Sale of 40 Bales of Snuff to be juſt, was a ſtrong Preſumption, that ſuch a Sale was made by them, to whom the approbation was given, and alſo a ſtrong Preſumption, that they had Snuff of his to ſell, and that it was not a Sale of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Snuff, becauſe it was then in the Cuſtody of the Court of Admiralty, and ſo not in their Power to ſell any of it: Which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the proceedings of the Admiralty, by which it appears, that <hi>D' Roſſel</hi> claimed as his own Property, a great Quantity of the 2217 Bags of Snuff Libelled againſt; That what he claimed, was acquitted about two years before the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s was, and before his departure from hence; and that there were only 1998 Bags of Snuff Delivered to <hi>Hett</hi> and <hi>Freſneau,</hi> as the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s; and from thence concluded, That <hi>D' Roſſel</hi> had Snuff of his own to
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003019_0011_0FEFA0B45902B9A8"/>
leave in their hands, out of which that Sale might have been made. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſiſted, That it appearing, that at <hi>D' Roſſel</hi>'s Departure, they undertook to pay ſundry Debts for him, and to be at the Charge of the Defence of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Snuff, it was improbable they would undertake this without his leaving ſomething in their hands to do it with, eſpecially ſeeing he had enough to leave with them, even of Snuff; and conſidering how precarious a Fond the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Snuff was, to repay them at that time, it being then as likely to be Condemned as Acquitted; and had it been Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, the Difficulty of their recovery of <hi>D' Roſſel,</hi> a Sea-fairing man of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Nation; and if acquitted, there could be no reaſon that the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Snuff ſhould pay <hi>D' Roſſel</hi>'s Debts. Which compared alſo with the great Sum allowed the <hi>India Company</hi> above their Freight, even when the Snuff was not Delivered at <hi>Cadiz,</hi> as it ought to have been: And from thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, That there was a great Probability that <hi>D' Roſſel</hi> left Effects in their hands to pay theſe Debts and Charges of the Proſecution, and that this Sale of Forty Bales, ſo approved of by <hi>D' Roſſel,</hi> was a part of what he ſo left in their hands, and of conſequence, Credit ought to have been given for it in the Defendants Accounts, and for all that he ſo left in their hands, and the rather for that the Defendants ſtill refuſed to produce their Books of Accounts, tho' expreſly demanded by the Bill, and twice ſince by the paſt Exceptions to the Anſwers. Upon the whole, That this was a Diſcovery accidentally dropt from the Defendants, which has with the utmoſt Care been endeavoured to be Concealed, and that no part of it ought to be with-drawn, and the rather, in this caſe, becauſe it is not ſhown by the Affidavit, that he was ſurprized into it, and any Reaſon there appearing, would ſerve as well to ſtifle any Perjury, when perceived as this: And as it was an Evidence affecting the Credit of what the Defendant <hi>Hett</hi> ſhould ſet forth in his Anſwers, they had a Right to the Preſervation thereof, and the granting the Defendants Petition would be a Depriving them of it; and the rather, it ought to ſtand, becauſe the Defendants third Anſwer was ſtill inſufficient, and to which the Complainants had Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; and ſo the Defendant <hi>Hett</hi> would have an opportunity by a fourth Anſwer, to add what ſalvo he thought proper to this matter. Upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration whereof, and hearing all that could be ſaid by the Council of both ſides, the Prayer of the ſaid Petition was then diſallowed; Nevertheleſs, if the Defendant <hi>Hett,</hi> had not the opportunity of a fourth Anſwer, and if he would then apply further, the Court would farther conſider of the matter. And the Complainants having Excepted to the Defendants third Anſwer, ſtill as Inſufficient and Evaſive, in many Points, the 14th Day of <hi>June</hi> was appointed, by order of this Court, for hearing the ſaid Exceptions. At which Day the ſame came to be debated &amp; agrued, in the preſence of Council of both ſides; and the 16th of the ſame Month was then appointed for a further hearing of the ſame, when the Exceptions were further Debated and argued by the Council of both ſides<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on each of which Days the ſaid third Anſwer was found Inſufficient and Evaſive in ſundry Points; and on the ſaid 16th Day, a further Anſwer was ordered to theſe Points; To which Points the Defendants filed their fourth Anſwer on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And the Defendants being ſubpoened to Rejoyn, they filed their Rejoynder on the 12th Day of the ſame Month, denying the Replication, and offering to prove their defences in their Anſwers.

And on the 13th of the ſame Month, the Defendants were ſerved with a Rule to produce their Witneſſes, in order to Examination of them.

Smith</hi> &amp; <hi>Sarah Hett</hi> were made Parties to the Bill, they would not abide the Judgment of the Court, and had a like fear of <hi>Mrs. Freſneau.</hi> Wherefore by Petition, ſetting alſo forth, That it appeared by the Anſwers, that the ſaid <hi>Abraham Gouverneur</hi> had received ſundry large Sums of Money, part of what the ſaid <hi>Hett</hi> had defrauded the Complainants of, and for which the ſaid <hi>Gouverneur</hi> could render an Account. Which Petition being annexed to the ſaid Affidavit the Complainants thereby prayed <hi>Ne Exeats</hi> againſt the ſaid <hi>Abraham Gouverneur, Wm. Smith, Sarah Hett</hi> and <hi>Heſter Freſneau,</hi> and that the Complainants might have leave to make the ſaid <hi>Abraham Gouverneur, Wm. Smith</hi> &amp; <hi>Sarah Hett</hi> Parties to the ſaid Bill; and (becauſe they were averſe to that Charge, unleſs of an unavoidable neceſſity of doing it, or of loſing their Money) they prayed time for the doing thereof, until the then Defendants have been ten days in Contempt for not complying with ſuch Decree as ſhall be given in this Cauſe, if any ſuch ſhall be given againſt the Defendants. Whereupon the Prayer of the Petition was granted, reſtricting the Security on the <hi>Ne Exeats</hi> to <hi>Two Thouſand Pounds.</hi> And the ſaid <hi>Abrah. Gouverneur, William Smith, Sarah Hett</hi> and <hi>Heſter Freſneau</hi> were taken on the <hi>Ne Exeats,</hi> and gave in Security accordingly. On which ſame 18th of <hi>July,</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainants, by another Petition, prayed (for avoiding of delay) that both ſides might make their full proof before the hearing of the Cauſe, and be concluded from Examining after the hearing: And on hearing of the Council of both ſides on the merits of the ſaid Petition, this Court did not ſee ſufficient cauſe for the granting thereof, therefore diſallowed the Prayer of the ſame. Afterwards, on the 21th day of the ſame Month, the Defendants were ſerved with the Rule to Examine their Witneſſes, &amp; the Complainants proceeded to Examine their Witneſſes. Afterwards, to wit, the ſecond day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1727. the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants, by Petition, without Affidvit, prayed Commiſſions to <hi>London,</hi> to Examine <hi>George Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Convinced of the abſolute necceſſity thereof, in ſo far as the granting of it would be, in effect, hanging up the Cauſe forever, becauſe moſt of the Perſons prayed to be Examined, being of another Nation, and Sea-fairing Men; and therefore probably ſcattered into different places unknown to the Defendants; it probably would be many years, if the Defendants did their utmoſt Endeavours, before they could be found to be Examined<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but if this was intended purely for Delay, they would take care that they ſhould never be found to be Examined; and ſo from time to time, obtain new Commiſſions, for which Pretences enough might be found.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> That it was evident from common Reaſon, and the Practice of the Court of Chancery at home, then ſhown, that the facts on which any thing is prayed, ought to appear true, and ſufficient for granting the thing deſired; and therefore the Defendants muſt be irregular inmaking this Petition, without any Proof of the Neceſſity of Examining theſe Witneſſes.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> That to make that Neceſſity evident, it ought to appear, by Affidavit or other-wiſe, what Points each Witneſs can depoſe to, and that the Petitioner knows of none here to prove the ſame Points, whereon the Court might and ought to conſider, whether theſe Points were material, that Delays, by unneceſſary Examinations, might be avided; and that, with this agrees the Practice of the Court of Chancery at Home, as appears in the Book of Orders thereof, page 207.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>dly,</hi> That ſhould the Court thereon be convinced that the Points were material, and that theſe Witneſſes could depoſe to them, yet the other Party had the Liberty of admitting theſe Points, as proved, which the Complainants would certainly chuſe, in this caſe, rather than be delayed; and played, That for the irregularity of this Petition, being without any Affidavit or Proof of the facts therof, it might be diſmiſſed. Whereupon, and upon hearing what could be ſaid by the Council of both ſides, this Court did order, That on or before the 2<hi>d</hi> day of <hi>September,</hi> the Defendants do file the Points to which they want to Examine beyond Sea; and by the 8th of the ſame Month, that they make it evident by Affidavit, or other-wiſe, that the Witneſſes can materially depoſe to theſe Points. Afterwards, to wit, the Ninth day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1727. the Complainant <hi>Pacheco,</hi> by Affidavit, ſet forth, That he had information that the Defendant <hi>Hett</hi> and one <hi>John Lafont,</hi> had privately packt a large Quantity of the Snuff in diſpute, into Barrels, and concealed the ſame; that it was lately carried in the night to, and concealed in the Cellar of one Mrs. <hi>Bieu,</hi> the Wife of a Marriner; and by Petition there-with, ſet forth, That the Defendant <hi>Hett,</hi> having abſconded, and the burthen of this Suit being like to fall on the Widow &amp; Children of <hi>Freſneau,</hi> the Diſcovery hereof would ſo much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Whereupon this Court did Order the Examiner of this Court to go to the Houſes of the ſaid <hi>Bieu</hi> and <hi>Lafont,</hi> and to Examine them to the Truth of the ſaid Information; and if upon Examination it appeared <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

That he in like manner Examined Mr. <hi>Lafont</hi> to the ſame, upon Oath, to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:003019_0014_0FEFA0BB5B184F50"/>
which the ſaid <hi>Lafont</hi> alſo anſwered in the <hi>Negative,</hi> and declared, he knew nothing of the matters there in contained: But being informed that Mr. <hi>Lafont</hi> had conſidered better of what he had ſaid, and that he would declare the whole truth, if he were Re-Examined, he the ſaid Examiner returned to Mr. <hi>Lafonts,</hi> and in the preſence of Coll. <hi>Lurting,</hi> one of the Maſters of this Court, Examined him to the ſame Points he had before done, to which he then replyed, That there was a private Cellar in the Houſe of <hi>Bieu</hi> before-mentioned, that there were many Barrels of Snuff lodged in ſaid Cellar; That he had packed three or four Barrels of ſaid Snuff; that the ſame was there lodged by Mr. <hi>Rene Hett,</hi> or his order, and marked for Beef; and that ſaid Cellar was hired by ſaid <hi>Hett</hi> for that purpoſe. The ſaid Examiner further reported, That after he had gone from Mr. <hi>Lafonts</hi> Houſe, but ſome few Steps, Mr. <hi>Lafont</hi> followed him, and deſired him to Obſerve, that he did not know that the ſaid Snuff belonged to the Cargo of the Ship <hi>Victory.</hi> And the ſaid Maſter Reported, That hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been preſent at the ſaid Laſt Examination of <hi>Lafont,</hi> he went with <hi>Elias Pipon,</hi> Son-in-Law of ſaid <hi>Lafont,</hi> with the Conſent of ſaid <hi>Lafont,</hi> to the Cellar of the ſaid <hi>Bieu,</hi> within which Cellar, along the Wall on the left ſide, there were Stanchions put up, and boards behind thoſe Stanchions, which Mr. <hi>Pipon</hi> having beat down, behind them then appeared a ſmall door nailed faſt, which he opened, within which was a ſmall Cellar, where lay Twenty Casks of Snuff, which he the ſaid Maſter took into his poſſeſſion, to wait the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther order of this Court concerning the ſame: Which Twenty Casks weigh 3697 Pounds neat. <hi>Robert Lurting, M. C.</hi> Afterwards, to wit, the 24th Day of the ſame Month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the Complainants by Petition, ſet forth, That they had credible information of ſundry more Quantities of the ſaid Snuff, which was quickly to be Tranſported to the Defendant <hi>Hett,</hi> who ſtill abſconded in another Province, to avoid the Juſtice of this Court, and that they had given notice of Examining ſundry Perſons, who they had reaſon to believe, were privy to the ſaid Concealments, and deſign of Tranſportation of ſaid Snuff, and therefore pray'd Relief of this Court herein; Whereupon it was ordered, That if the Examiner upon the Examination of the Witneſſes in this cauſe, does there-from diſcover any more Quantities of Snuff, ſo concealed by the Defendant, <hi>Hett,</hi> That the Examiner acquaint this Court thereof, And if his Excellency ſhould be abſent, that <hi>Robert Lurting,</hi> one of the Maſters, do take it into his Cuſtody, to wait the further Order of this Court.</p>
            <p>Afterwards, purſuant to the Order of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 2d, the Defendants filed the Points they would Examine to beyond Sea, which in ſubſtance are,</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt,</hi> That Capt. <hi>D' Roſſel</hi> agreed to pay <hi>Freſneau</hi> and <hi>Hett</hi> all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions they charge.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> That he ordered them to pay the neceſſary Charges of the Snuff, and what Debts were owing by him, and to ſell a part of the Snuff for that purpoſe; and that by his Power of Attorney, in the Anſwers mentioned, he intended fully to enable them to that purpoſe.</p>

            <p n="7">7<hi>thly,</hi> That he ordered them not to part with the Snuff to the <hi>French Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,</hi> without a preciſe Order from him.</p>

            <p n="10">10<hi>thly,</hi> To Examine <hi>De Lara</hi> and <hi>De Coſta,</hi> as to an Agreement about the Account and Bond ſet forth in the Anſwers.</p>
            <p>And the Hearing of this Matter being put off to the 15th day of <hi>September,</hi> 1727. at which day the ſame coming to be heard, in preſence of Council of both ſides, the Council for the Executors of <hi>Freſneau</hi> diſowned the ſaid Petition for Commiſſions, and prayed that this Court would proceed without delay to the Determination of this Cauſe. And by the Council for the Defendant <hi>Hett,</hi> it was inſiſted on, That theſe Points were material, and proper to be examined to in Foreign Parts, in ſo far as moſt of theſe Points were by the Anſwers aſſerted to be True; and that theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ſons, who from the nature of the thing, muſt have been Tranſacting them, or privy thereto, muſt be preſumed to be the moſt proper Evidences thereto.</p>
            <p>To which it was anſwered by the Complainants Council, That they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them not very material, and rather than to be put to the Delay of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, would admit every one of theſe Points to be true. And then in part, but more fully afterwards; on the hearing of this Cauſe, inſiſted That as to the <hi>firſt Point,</hi> This is the very firſt time that in all this Cauſe this thing was broached, and a matter of ſuch Moment as the Defendants would make it, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not (were it true) have ſlipt the Defendants Memory, during all the four Anſwers. But yet, there is nothing to that Purpoſe in any of the Anſwers; and as by the Anſwers, no ſuch thing was aſſerted or put in iſſue, they could not, by the Practice of the Court, examine to it. Again, it cannot well be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, that ſuch a thing could be without ſome Writing, or Letter, or Paper, or ſome Perſons here who have heard it; and yet, no ſuch thing do they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend there is: But further inſiſted, That were ſuch agreement confeſſed, it would be no way binding, for by the Law of Nations, and of Merchants, no Maſter of a Veſſel (as <hi>D' Roſſel</hi> was) nor even the Owners (as the <hi>India Company</hi> were) could (either alone or both together) charge the goods freighted with them (as this Snuff of the <hi>King of Spain</hi>'s was) with any thing beyond the Freight agreed on, further than the Expences that are abſolutely neceſſary for the Preſervation thereof: Again, were that Agreement good and binding, then if <hi>Hett</hi> had the ſame but one Night in his Cuſtody, he muſt have had ſo much for it as now; and whatever Power <hi>D' Roſſel</hi> had to make that Agreement with him, he had a like Power to make it with another Perſon; and ſo, after it had been a Night in <hi>Hetts</hi> Cuſtody, might have put it into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Cuſtody, upon like terms, and the like with a third, fourth, fifth, &amp;c. Perſons; how abſurd and contrary to common Reaſon, &amp; the Laws of Nations and of Merchans this would be, needeth not further enlarging on. And therefore either ſuch an Agreement never was; but if it had been, the ſame is void.</p>
            <p>As to the 2<hi>d Point,</hi> the Complainants never did or will diſpute the payment of neceſſary Charges about the Snuff; but as to <hi>D' Roſſel's</hi> Debts, no Order of his can, in Law or Reaſon, make another perſons Good liable to the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them: And as to his Power, it could not impower them to do what neither he nor the <hi>India Company</hi> themſelves could do, to ſell another Perſons Goods, unleſs an abſolute Neceſſity had happened, of ſelling a part for the Perſervation of the reſt; which Neceſſity has no way appeared in this caſe.</p>
            <p>As to the 3<hi>d,</hi> 4<hi>th,</hi> 5<hi>th</hi> &amp; 6<hi>th,</hi> the proving or not proving of theſe Orders,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:003019_0016_0FEFA0C3216A2F18"/>
cannot be material or affect this Cauſe, for the Reaſons before; nor can it be material to prove the 7<hi>th Point,</hi> for its only proving that <hi>D' Roſſel</hi> gave them an Order, which neither Law nor Reaſon could juſtify them in obeying: For as by the Law of Nations and of Merchants, the Owners of a Ship are anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for the Maſter, and all Perſons to whom he ſhall intruſt the goods freighted in their Ship, it muſt be in their Power either to change the Maſter or Keeper of thoſe Goods, for ſuch Perſons as they ſhall chuſe rather to truſt them with.</p>
            <p>As to the 8<hi>th,</hi> They acknowledged, it might be material, and rather than be delayed, they would chuſe to admit it to be true.</p>
            <p>As to the 9<hi>th,</hi> Mr. <hi>Chabot</hi> could not be the proper Evidence of what was Shipt in the <hi>Duke of Portland,</hi> but the Cuſtom-Houſe-Books, the Maſter and Owners here, muſt be proper Evidences of the Quantity Shipt, and <hi>Chabot,</hi> could only be of the Quantity Delivered him.</p>
            <p>As to the 10<hi>th,</hi> Every thing material concerning the Agreement and Bond, in the Anſwer ſet forth, was as well tranſacted with Mr. <hi>Pacheco,</hi> as <hi>De Lara</hi> and <hi>De Coſta,</hi> ſo that they could Examine Mr. <hi>Pacheco</hi> here upon the Spot, to that matter, who was ready to Anſwer any Interrogatories to that purpoſe; and it was aſſerted, They might have Examined <hi>De Lara</hi> &amp; <hi>De Coſta</hi> before they went, they having given publick Notice of their going, in the Secretary's Office, according to the Cuſtom of this place. So that upon the whole, they inſiſted, This pretence of want of Commiſſions to Examine beyond Seas, was only a pretext to delay Juſtice in this cauſe, and the rather, for that it has been publick fame here, theſe many Months paſt, that <hi>D' Roſſel</hi> was Ship-wreckt and loſt in a Voyage for <hi>Quebeck,</hi> and his Officers being Sea-faring Men, could not be ſuppoſed to be eaſily found, to be Examined. And further inſiſted, That tho' the Points had been material, and were ſet forth in the Anſwer as true, yet it could no way be inferred from thence, that theſe Perſons ſet forth in the Petition, could prove theſe Points, Nor that there were no Perſons or means here to prove them; both which they conceiv'd ought to appear to this Court, before ſuch a delay, as almoſt a mounted to hanging up the Cauſe forever, were granted, and which, by the Reaſon and Practice ſet forth in the former hearing on this matter, ought to appear to this Court; And therefore prayed, the ſaid Petition for Commiſſions might be Rejected.</p>
            <p>And upon hearing what was alledged by the Council of both ſides, this Court was of opinion, That ſufficient Reaſon did not appear to grant the Commiſſions prayed for. And thereupon the Council for the Defendant <hi>Hett,</hi> produced an Affidavit made by him, to this purpoſe, That he is adviſed by his Council, that its material and Neceſſary for him to Examine Witneſſes in foreign Parts, to prove the aforeſaid ten Points, and that he believes that <hi>D' Roſſel</hi> can prove all that's material for him to prove in the firſt eight Articles; and that about fifteen Months ago he had a Letter from him, and has not received any account of his Deceaſe ſince that time, but does believe, he is ſtill alive: That <hi>Baraule, Durand</hi> and <hi>Livodes</hi> were acquainted in ſome meaſure with the affairs relating to the Cargo of the <hi>Victory,</hi> and believes they can materially depoſe to the matters contained in ſome of the ſaid Articles: That he believes <hi>Chabot</hi> can Evidence the 9<hi>th Article,</hi> and <hi>De Lara</hi> and <hi>De Coſta,</hi> the matters referred to in the 10<hi>th Article;</hi> and that he is adviſed and believes, it's not ſafe to go to hearing without Examining them to the aforeſaid Articles; and that he believes the Intereſt of the Defendants is concerned in ſuch Examination to the value of <hi>Two Thouſand Pounds.</hi> Which Affidavit was read, after ſome oppoſition to the reading thereof, by the Complainants Council, for that it had not been filed
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:003019_0017_0FEFA0C519FDA7F0"/>
with the Regiſter before hand, according to the practice of the Court, in order that they might have got a Copy thereof, and been prepared to ſpeak to it.</p>
            <p>And thereupon it was <hi>Ordered,</hi> That the ſame be ſpoke to that Day three Weeks.</p>
            <p>Afterwards, to wit, the ſixteenth Day of the ſame Month of <hi>September,</hi> the Complainant <hi>Pacheco,</hi> made Oath, by Affidavit filed, That there are ſundry Facts, which he is adviſed are material, to Croſs-Examine the Defendant <hi>Hett</hi> upon, concerning the Points of the ſaid Commiſſions and Affidavit, and that he believed the Defendant <hi>Hetts</hi> Anſwers to Interrogatories for that purpoſe, would in a great meaſure avoid the Reaſons adduced for granting the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions; and that he knew not how otherwiſe to prove thoſe Facts, than by the Anſwers of the Defendant <hi>Hett,</hi> to ſuch Interrogatories. And on the 18th of the ſame Month, upon Notice duly given, the Complainants Council moved, that a Day might be prefixed for Croſs-Examining the Defendant <hi>Hett,</hi> as aforeſaid; and offered the Interrogatories, that the Court might judge whether they were material. And Becauſe the ſaid Defendant had not purged his Contempt herein before-mentioned, moved further, That a day might be prefixed for him to appear and purge his Contempt, or that (according to the Practice of the <hi>Court of Chancery</hi> at home, to grant no favours to Perſons while in Contempt) the Petition for Commiſſions be Rejected. And that to prevent ſurprize (as three weeks were given for a further hearing, on the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants Petition for Commiſſions) if any further Affidavit or matter of Proof, the Defendants will uſe to ſupport it, moved further, That they might file it with the Regiſter a week before hearing. Whereupon, the Defendant <hi>Hetts</hi> Council, anſwered, That it was unprecedented to Examine the Defendant in any ſuch Caſe; and that as their Affidavit was a voluntary Affidavit, which they might have choſen to make, or let it alone <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> they may chuſe to be Croſs-Examined, or let it alone, and are not Compellable thereto. And as to the Contempt, they had paid the Coſts therof to the Complainants Council, which were accepted of by them, and ſo they had no right to move any ſuch thing. And as to the filing ſuch further Affidavit, as moved, they had no Objection thereto.</p>
            <p>It was Replyed by the Complainants Council, That as to the Contempt, tho' they had no right to move it, yet as no Satisfaction was made to the Court, according to the Rules, the Court might, if they pleaſed, give order for the purging of the Contempt, and hoped the Court would, in ſo far as the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant <hi>Hett</hi> had for ſo long time abſconded, to avoid the Juſtice of the Court; and that if he did not appear, the Proceedings thereof were like to be of little effect in this caſe, except only againſt the Fatherleſs Children and Widdow of <hi>Freſneau.</hi>

            <p>Whereupon, and upon hearing of what was alledged by the Council of both ſides, this Court was of Opinion, <hi>That as the Defendants Affidavit was volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, he is not compellable, but may chuſe to be croſs-examined concerning the Facts thereof, or not:</hi> But at the ſame time the Defendants declining ſuch Croſs-Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, takes off the Force of the Affidavit, in ſo far as the Exception to the ſame ſeemeth juſt.

And (according to Notice given) it was further moved, That a ſhort Day might be appointed for Publication in this Cauſe, in regard the Complainant <hi>Pacheco</hi> only waited in this Province for the Iſſue of this Suit, as by Affidavit appeared. Whereupon it was alledged by the Council for the Defendant <hi>Hett,</hi> That neither the ſaid <hi>Rene Hett,</hi> his Council, Sollicitor or Clerk in Court, had been ſerved with the laſt Order, and therefore the Defendant <hi>Hett</hi>'s not appearing Perſonally in Court, ought not to barr him from having Commiſſions to Examine, as prayed by his Petition. To which it was Replyed by the Complainants Council, That the ſaid Order having been made in the preſence, and upon full hearing of all Parties, there could be no need of Service thereof. And upon hearing what was alledged of both ſides, it was Ordered, <hi>That the time for the Defendant</hi> Hett<hi>'s appearance, be enlarged for four Weeks; and that ſeeing no further Proof has been filed to ſupport the ſaid Petition, if the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant</hi> Hett <hi>will claim any Benefit by his Affidavit for that purpoſe, he do then ſubmit himſelf to be Examined to the Interrogatories exhibited by the Complainants, concerning the Facts in the ſaid Affidavit;</hi> Or, <hi>That the Petition be then finally diſmiſſed.</hi> And at the humble prayer of the Complainants, his Excellency will take the Trouble of the Examination aforeſaid.</p>

Upon Motion of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainants Council (the Council for the Executors of <hi>Freſneau</hi> being preſent, and not oppoſing thereto) Its Ordered, <hi>That the Petition of the Defendant</hi> Rene Hett, <hi>for Commiſſions to examine Witneſſes in foreign Parts, be finally Diſmiſſed, and that Publication paſs in this Cauſe in Eight days; and that this Cauſe be heard on this day five Weeks.</hi>

hard to raiſe ſo large a Sum in ſo short a time, and that it was hard he could not ſee the Account; and that he had asks Mr.</hi> Hett <hi>for it;</hi> And further ſaith, <hi>That he believed that from certain Paſſages at the Tender &amp; Payment of the Money, none of the bearers had ſeen the Account; That when the Money was on the Table Mr.</hi> Pacheco <hi>ſaid, Mr.</hi> Hett, <hi>you may now let me ſee the Account, for the Money is on the Table, or to that purpoſe; upon which</hi> Hett <hi>produced the Account.</hi> Which matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered together, do more than to a Probability, make good the Subſtance of the fourth head charged.

It is ſaid by <hi>Richard Nicholls</hi> Depoſition to the 23d Interrogatory, That immediately after the Money of the Account was paid, <hi>Abraham Gouverneur</hi> pulled a Paper out of his Pocket, and read it to the Bearers, and ſaid, <hi>They muſt enter into a Bond of the ſame Conditions;</hi> and <hi>Hett</hi> then ſaid, <hi>If they would Execute that Bond, they might begin to Weigh, if it was the next day;</hi> That <hi>Pacheco,</hi> ſaid to the Deponent, he thought the Snuff ſhould be delivered as ſoon as the Payment was made, and that now he was at a Loſs what to do, or to that purpoſe.

Which Anſwer to this matter being alſo found Evaſive and Inſufficient, the Defendant <hi>Hett,</hi> in his 4<hi>th Anſwer, fol.</hi> 19 &amp; 20. ſaith, That the Account that <hi>Abraham Gouverneur</hi> entered the Articles in, that were read to him by <hi>Freſneau,</hi> was that Account, from whence the Account delivered to the Complainants was drawn; and this Defendant hath applyed to <hi>Abraham Gouverneur</hi> for the ſaid Original Account, and he ſays, he has applyed the ſame to a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſe, long before this Suit commenced, and that it can't be produced; and the Defendants, and every of them deny, that to their knowledge or belief, they or any body for them, or either of them, have or hath any Book or Books regularly or irregularly kept, or Accounts, other than in this and their former Anſwers hath been ſet forth. Again, <hi>John Scott</hi> (who lived with &amp; did buſineſs for Mr. <hi>Freſneau</hi>) in his Depoſition to the 20th Interrogatory, ſaith, That Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and Memorandums were kept by <hi>Freſneau</hi> and <hi>Hett</hi> concerning the ſaid Snuff, and that the Tranſactions concerning the ſaid Snuff, ſuch as ſhipping it off, paying the Charges concerning it, and the Sales of it, were entered in a Memorandum Book, which Entries were made by him the Deponent, and ſays, That all the Papers relating to this Affair, were kept in a bundle together at Mr. <hi>Freſneaus,</hi> until a little before <hi>Freſneau's</hi> Death, and then Mr. <hi>Hett</hi> took them, as he told this Deponent; but whether he had them all, or not, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Depoſe.

            <p>As to the 22<hi>d,</hi> 23<hi>d,</hi> 24<hi>th,</hi> &amp; 25<hi>th, Articles,</hi> to Mr. <hi>Wileman,</hi> Regiſter of the Admiralty, its ſaid in the 2<hi>d Anſwer, fol.</hi> 62. That theſe Payments were made by the Defendant <hi>Hett</hi> and <hi>Andrew Freſneau,</hi> deceaſed, and for which Receipts have been taken, ready to be produced. Which Receipts being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be produced, and none given, and Exceptions being taken hereto; the Defendant <hi>Hett,</hi> in his 3<hi>d Anſwer, fol.</hi> 33, 34. ſaith, That an account of <hi>Forty two Pounds two Shillings</hi> and <hi>ſix Pence</hi> paid to Mr. <hi>Wileman</hi> for Regiſters Fees, with a Letter wherein the ſaid account was Encloſed, Directed to <hi>Andrew Freſneau,</hi> whereby the ſaid <hi>Freſneau</hi> was deſired to pay <hi>Nathan Simſon</hi> Forty Six Pounds on his Account, are in the Defendant <hi>Hetts</hi> Cuſtody, and ready to be produced when Demanded. And alſo, the Defendant has Lately procured an Account of Particulars amounting to <hi>Twenty five Pounds ſix Shillings more;</hi> alſo, another of <hi>Ten Pounds one Shilling</hi> and <hi>ſix Pence more,</hi> which are alſo ready to be produced, which is all that he can obtain, or the ſaid <hi>Wileman</hi> give, as he has been informed by ſaid <hi>Wileman.</hi> Which Papers being demanded to be produced, and Copies thereof given, it appears that the Accounts of 25 <hi>l.</hi> 6 <hi>s. &amp;</hi> 10 <hi>l.</hi> 1 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> were for the Regiſters Fees in the year 1719. as well on the account of the <hi>French</hi> as <hi>Spanish</hi> Goods, and for which <hi>D'Roſſel</hi> being then on the Spot, muſt be preſumed to have paid, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſeeing the Defendant offers no Receipt for theſe Sums, and the rather ſtill, for that the Defendant <hi>Hett,</hi> in his <hi>firſt Anſwer, fol.</hi> 32, ſaith, That to his knowledge <hi>D'Roſſel</hi> ſold ſeveral <hi>Hundred Pounds</hi> worth of Goods to defray the Charges of the part of his Cargo that was Cleared of the Caption before his Departure. And it was farther hereon Obſerved how little Credit ought to be given to the Defendant <hi>Hetts</hi> Account or Pretences, even upon Oath, ſeeing he has adventured by theſe <hi>four Articles</hi> to <hi>Charge</hi> 141 <hi>l.</hi> 15 <hi>s.</hi> 2½ <hi>d.</hi> as paid to Mr. <hi>Wileman</hi> (an Inhabitant in the Town, &amp; who might Eaſily Juſtify this matter if true) and upon Oath to ſay, by Receipts ready to be produced, and when put to it, can ſhow no Receipt, &amp; but only a Probability of Payment of 42 <hi>l.</hi> 2 <hi>s.</hi> 6. <hi>d.</hi> on this Affair. The other two Accounts being, for the Reaſons above, moſt probably paid by <hi>D'Roſſel,</hi> at leaſt nothing is pretended that can ſhow they were paid by the Defendants.</p>
            <p>As to the 26 <hi>Article of</hi> 65 <hi>l.</hi> the Defendant <hi>Hett</hi> ſays, in his 2<hi>d Anſwer, fol.</hi> 63. That it was ſundry Tavern Expences paid at ſundry times in Treats of the Court Lawyers, and others concerned in this Affair, and that the whole was Computed by himſelf and <hi>Freſneau</hi> to amount to 65 <hi>l.</hi> Which being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted to, for that the 7th Article of 48 <hi>l.</hi> 14<hi>s.</hi> 1½ <hi>d.</hi> was not diſputed by the Complainants for Charges, and that it could hardly be that they were put to both theſe Sums in Expences, therefore the Defendant <hi>Hett,</hi> in his 3<hi>d An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, fol.</hi> 2. ſays, That the 65 <hi>l.</hi> Charges accrued after the 7th Article had been allowed of by the Court of Admiralty, which by the procedings thereof
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:003019_0025_0FEFA0DE1972F038"/>
appear to be on the acquittal of the Tobaccoes. And theron it was Obeſrved, That in the nature of things, it was hardly Poſſible, and far from Probable, that after ſentence, when either Court or Lawyers had little to do in the Affair, the Defendants could be at ſo much Charge in treating of them: Which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the Depoſition of <hi>Andrew Hamilton,</hi> to the Twelvth Interrogatory, who ſaith, That he does not remember that he ever put ſaid <hi>Hett</hi> &amp; <hi>Freſneau,</hi> or either of them, to any Expenſe in a Tavern, unleſſ that one night he was at a ſupper, which he thinks might be ſome very ſmall Expenſe to them. And that all this taken together, ſhows the Improbability of ſo much being Depended, as is ſaid in this Article.</p>
            <p>As to the 28<hi>th</hi> Article of <hi>Ten Pounds</hi> paid to the Pilot of the <hi>Victory,</hi> the Defendant <hi>Hett</hi> acknowledges in <hi>fol.</hi> 76. of his 2<hi>d Anſwer,</hi> That he only paid 4 <hi>l.</hi> 10<hi>s.</hi> tho' he took a Receipt for <hi>Ten Pounds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the 33<hi>d,</hi> 34<hi>th,</hi> 39<hi>th,</hi> &amp; 43<hi>d, Articles,</hi> the Defendant <hi>Hett</hi> ſays, They were paid, or he was liable to pay them; the 33<hi>d</hi> &amp; 34<hi>th,</hi> he conceived <hi>Abraham Gouverneur</hi> deſerved for theſe Services, and had applyed to him for an Account, but he could give none. The 39<hi>th</hi> was paid one half to Mr. <hi>Wileman,</hi> and the other half due to Mr. <hi>Clows,</hi> he had asked an Account of <hi>Wileman,</hi> but could get none, but proffers Mr. <hi>Clows's:</hi> And the 43d he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved came to more, but had no account of it.</p>
            <p>As to the 40<hi>th,</hi> 41<hi>ſt</hi> &amp; 42<hi>d Articles,</hi> on the face of the Account, it appears that 230 days <hi>Negro-hire,</hi> does not come to 40<hi>l.</hi> as charged in the 40<hi>th Article,</hi> As to which the Defendant <hi>Hett</hi> ſays, in his 2<hi>d Anſwer, fol.</hi> 83 &amp; 86. <hi>That Cartage and Poſts to ſupport the Ware-houſe muſt be included, &amp; that the</hi> Negro-hire <hi>was to turn the Snuff after a Storm, that much damaged it, and denys it was done with the fraudalent view of chuſing the beſt Snuff to Ship off for</hi> Holland <hi>and</hi> England. And in his 3d Anſwer, <hi>fol.</hi> 14. he ſays, <hi>He paid about one half of the</hi> Negro-hire, <hi>and</hi> Freſneau <hi>the other half, but no account was kept of it.</hi> And as to the 41<hi>ſt,</hi> the Defendant <hi>Hett</hi> ſays, in his 2d Anſwer, <hi>fol.</hi> 98. <hi>That he paid ſo much for mending the Bags to one</hi> Bon Repos, <hi>and that there was a Neceſſary for that Charge, becauſe of the Storm.</hi> And in his 3d Anſwer, <hi>fol.</hi> 16. he ſay, <hi>He can get no account of</hi> Bon Repos, <hi>but he paid him ſo much.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the 42<hi>d Article,</hi> the Defendant <hi>Hett</hi> ſays, in his 2d Anſwer, from <hi>fol.</hi> 92, to 94. That Ozenbrigs were then 15<hi>d. per yard,</hi> That he bought them a <hi>Penny-worth,</hi> and being a Shop-keeper might take a reaſonable Advantage on them; confeſſes he bought 771 Ells thereof of Mr. <hi>Delancy</hi> for 12 <hi>d. per Ell,</hi> and 967 Ells of <hi>Nunez</hi> at 12½ <hi>d,</hi> and the remainder of <hi>Bryer</hi> at 16 <hi>d,</hi> and ſome Tents were uſed to this purpoſe. And in his 3<hi>d Anſwer, fol.</hi> 14 &amp; 15. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes <hi>Bryer's</hi> Ozenbrigs to be 367 Ells, and had 40 Tents for <hi>Fifteen Pounds,</hi> and thirty Tents for <hi>Thirteen Pound Ten Shillings;</hi> and for ſix Tents, <hi>Twelve Pounds,</hi> and that he believes all ſaid <hi>Ozenbrigs</hi> and <hi>Tents</hi> were applyed to making, mending, patching and repairing the Bags, and that one ſound Tent would make about five or ſix Bags, but ſome were in part rotten. And in his 4<hi>th Anſwer, fol.</hi> 11 to 13. confeſſes of whom the Tents were bought, and when they and the Ozenbrigs were paid for, and that what was ſaid in his 3<hi>d Anſwer,</hi> to be Six Tents, <hi>Twelve Pounds,</hi> ſhould have been for Twelve Tents, <hi>Six Pounds.</hi> As to which, <hi>John Scott</hi> in his Depoſition to the 18th Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ſaith, That no Ozenbrigs that he knew of were uſed about the Bags, but a cheaper ſort of Linnen, called <hi>Hartfords,</hi> and ſome old Tents, and that ſaid Linnen and Tents were uſed for patching and covering ſaid Bags; and he ſays, that many Bags were needleſsly covered, and ſome were covered which
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:003019_0026_0FEFA0DFABA0FDB8"/>
wanted only patching; and he ſays, That ſuch as at firſt wanted Patching or Covering, were patched &amp; covered by the joynt order of Mr. <hi>Hett</hi> &amp; <hi>Freſneau;</hi> &amp; afterwards, Mr. <hi>Freſneau</hi> obſerving that Mr. <hi>Hett</hi> would have more Bags cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than wanted it, did oppoſe the doing of the ſame, to which Mr. <hi>Hett</hi> replyed, <hi>I will cover my own half, and put the Profit in my own Pocket;</hi> and that <hi>Freſneau</hi> ſaid, he could not Anſwer the doing ſo. And <hi>Joſeph Jamain</hi> in his Depoſition to the ſame Interrogatory ſaith, That he believes the Snuff might have been preſerved without covering the Bags a new with new Stuff, but cannot tell who ordered ſaid Bags to be new covered, but has heard that Mr. <hi>Freſneau</hi> did oppoſe the new covering the ſame, and that he told Mr. <hi>Hett, That it was not fair to put Money in his Pocket thereby.</hi> And it further appears by the Certificate herein-before-mentioned, of the Deputy Weigh Maſter, That there were 804 of the Bags delivered to the Complainants, which were covered, and no more; and upon the whole of theſe three Articles, it was obſerved, there was not only a very great Over-charge, but hardly fair dealing in <hi>Hett</hi> concerning them; and that by the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nations,</hi> of <hi>Merchants</hi> and of <hi>Common Reaſon,</hi> no more than the neceſſary Charge ought in this caſe to be allowed.</p>

               <label>Proof of Charge XIII.</label>
As to which, the Defendant <hi>Hett</hi> ſays, in his 2<hi>d Anſwer, fol.</hi> 90. <hi>That</hi> D' Roſſel <hi>gave directions to make ſuch Preſents as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <label>Proof of Charge XIV.</label>
Its admitted by the Anſwers, there can be no diſpute but that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions ought to be ſo reduced.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Proof of Charge XV.</label>
As to this matter, the Defendant <hi>Hett,</hi> in his <hi>firſt Anſwer,</hi> from <hi>fol.</hi> 20 to 27. ſets forth, That Commiſſions at <hi>Five per Cent.</hi> were talkt of with the Complainants before the acceptance of the Agreement at <hi>Paris,</hi> That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainant <hi>Pacheco</hi> ſaid, It was too much, but ſaid, if he could prove that any Merchant in <hi>New-York,</hi> had ſo much he ſhould have it; that he after-wards ſhowed them a Cetificate of two perſons that they had <hi>Five per Cent.</hi> for Delivery, with which its there ſaid, the Complainants were ſatisfied. On which it was obſerved, That no Proof being of this matter, it is as if no ſuch thing had been; &amp; it was theron further obſerved, That no other Commiſſions whatſoever are mentioned in the firſt Anſwer, than that <hi>Five per Cent.</hi> and would the Defendants have been ſatisfied with that, it would not have been a Diſpute here. Again, the Defendants in their 2<hi>d Anſwer, fol.</hi> 79. ſay, They do believe, that by the Cuſtom of Merchants <hi>Two and a half per Cent.</hi> is uſually allowed for ſtoreage, tho' the goods received by the Factor were immediatly ſold and Delivered, and never actually put in any Store-Houſe, but
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:003019_0027_0FEFA0E218A9B498"/>
here the Store-Rent came to more than the Storeage. Again, the Defendant <hi>Hett,</hi> in <hi>fol.</hi> 90. of 2<hi>d Anſwer</hi> ſaith, That by the Cuſtom of Merchants, he believes, its uſual to charge <hi>Five per Cent.</hi> for receiving, and <hi>Five per Cent.</hi> for Delivery, and <hi>Two and half per Cent.</hi> for ſtoreage, tho' perhaps the goods are not detained one day in the Cuſtody of the Factor. On which it was obſerved, That no Proof was of this, and that if there had been, yet it muſt be when Goods are ſent to a Factor to ſell, and if thoſe Goods he ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to ſell the ſame day he receives them, and make Returns of the Price the ſame day, then <hi>Five per Cent.</hi> for the Sales, and <hi>Five per Cent.</hi> for the Returns, and <hi>Two and a half per Cent.</hi> for the Storeage, its agreed is uſual; but this is no ſuch Caſe; for theſe Tobacco's were never put into their hands for any ſuch Purpoſe as to ſell or make Returns of them, and for no other purpoſe, but the ſafe-keeping of them till called for, and Commiſſions for the ſafe-keeping, and no other, could or ought to be demanded in this caſe. That if barely for receiving and Delivery <hi>Ten per Cent.</hi> Commiſſions were due, then every Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thro' whoſe hands goods once came, ought to have the ſame, the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and abſurdity whereof, could not be hard to ſee.</p>
            <p>Again, the Defendant <hi>Hett,</hi> in the 2<hi>d Anſwer, fol.</hi> 102 &amp; 103. ſaith, That by the Cuſtom of Merchants, he believes he can fully Juſtifie his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Seven and a half per Cent.</hi> for Commiſſions and Storeage, and ſays, That the Complainants did freely, and without Compulſion, agree to pay the ſame before their Acceptation aforeſaid, in manner as in firſt Anſwer is ſet forth.</p>
            <p>Whereupon it was obſerved, That the Defendant here brings the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Complainants to ſupport that Cuſtom of Merchants; but, as was obſerved before, there is not a word mentioned in the <hi>firſt Anſwer</hi> of more Commiſſions than of <hi>five per Cent.</hi> And as to the Cuſtom of Merchants, it was inſiſted, That none ſuch was proven, and for the Reaſons before, no ſuch Cuſtom could be.</p>
            <p>Again, the Defendant <hi>Hett,</hi> in <hi>fol.</hi> 105. of the 2<hi>d Anſwer,</hi> ſaith, <hi>That he verily believes, and doubts not but that he shall be able to prove, that it is agreeable to the Uſage of Merchants in</hi> New-York, <hi>in ſuch caſes where goods are received, tho' they are not ſold, but delivered over by the Order of the Employer, to a third Perſon, to charge ſo much as he has charged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon which it was obſerved, That no ſucn Uſage appeared; but if it did, it could only be when Goods were put into a Merchants hands to ſell, and in that caſe, tho' not ſold, yet as he was willing to ſell them, and had been at pains to ſhow them (perhaps to many People) for Sale, it was but reaſonable in that caſe to charge the Commiſſions for ſtoreage and Sale, (which is <hi>Seven and half per Cent.</hi>) upon delivery over of the goods to the owner or another Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, if no default was in him that they were not ſold before. And that the Cuſtom might be ſo, in that caſe, they admitted; but that this Caſe was not like it, the goods here being never put into their hands for Sale, nor could they be at any trouble in ſhowing them to buyers, or bargaining about them, which is a great part of the cauſe for which Commiſſions are drawn; and therefore if this were proven, it would not juſtify <hi>Seven and a half per Cent.</hi> in this caſe, and far Leſs <hi>Twelve and a half per Cent.</hi> as is charged; and inſiſted, that the knavery appearing in this caſe, and the not keeping or making away with the Accounts, ought in Reaſon to Deprive them of Commiſſions (were they other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe due) for Commiſſions would ſeem only due to thoſe who have honeſtly performed, or endeavoured to perform, the ſervice for which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:003019_0028_0FEFA0E46538D2E8"/>
are demanded. And further, the Complainants Council inſiſted on the Arguments herein before ſet forth, on the <hi>firſt Point,</hi> to which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant <hi>Hett</hi> prayed Commiſſions to Examine beyond ſea; and on the whole, inſiſted, That only Commiſſions of <hi>Two and a half per Cent.</hi> for ſtoreage, and what the ſtoreage might exceed the Commiſſions, and what was reaſonable for Pains, care and labour about the Snuff, ought to be allowed of, in this Caſe.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Proof of Charge XVI.</label>
Upon this the Defendants in their 2<hi>d Anſwer,</hi> from <hi>fol.</hi> 9 to 16. ſet forth, a Letter of Attorney to <hi>Freſneau</hi> and <hi>Hett,</hi> dated the 29<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1719. from Capt. <hi>D' Roſſel,</hi> whereby he makes them his Attorneys to receive all Moneys, Goods, &amp;c. due to him in this Province, and to proſecute the Suit in the Admiralty, about the Snuff and Tobacco, as alſo ſundry Sums of Money and Ambergreefe, and to uſe all lawful, means for the Recovery thereof, and upon Receipt thereof, to diſpoſe of the ſame for his uſe, and to pay and diſcharge all Coſts and Charges relating to and concerning the ſame; and that by virtue of that Power, they diſpoſed of ſundry Parcels for defraying the neceſſary Charges.</p>
            <p>As to which, it was inſiſted, from the Reaſons of the Argument of the 15<hi>th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> laſt, upon the <hi>firſt Point</hi> which the Defendant <hi>Hett</hi> would have examined to beyond Seas, That neither the <hi>India Company</hi> nor <hi>D' Roſſel</hi> could themſelves ſell any of the ſaid Tobacco's, unleſs in caſe of an abſolute Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of ſelling a part for the Preſervation of the reſt; and therefore their Letter of Attorney could give no more Power than they had.</p>
            <p>Again, the Anſwers ſet forth, <hi>That</hi> Hett <hi>&amp;</hi> Freſneau, <hi>by the Cuſtom of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts, had Power to ſell to pay neceſſary Charges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon which it was obſerved, That in caſes of abſolute Neceſſity, for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the reſt, a part might be ſold: or if the Owner will not, upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per application, pay Freight and neceſſary Charges: in theſe caſes the Cuſtom alledged, was admitted, and denyed in any other. But here was neither an abſolute Neceſſity to ſell a part for the Preſervation of the reſt, nor any refuſal of Payment of Neceſſary charges, but on the contrary, it appears in 2<hi>d Anſwer, fol.</hi> 17 &amp; 18. by a Letter from the <hi>India Company,</hi> there ſet forth, dated the 14<hi>th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> 1722. wherein they Promiſed to <hi>Hett</hi> &amp; <hi>Freſneau,</hi> that they ſhould be exactly reimburſed all their Charges concerning the ſaid Tobacco's.</p>
            <p>And it further appears by the Account and Anſwers, and the Letters of <hi>Hett</hi> and <hi>Freſneau,</hi> that they on the 22d of <hi>March,</hi> 1721-2. drew Bills for Two Hundred Pounds Sterling, on the Company, which its confeſſed were paid; and from thence it was inferred, that as the <hi>India Company</hi> Promiſed to reim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſe them, and ſo far as they drew, paid; There nothing can appear but that the <hi>India Company</hi> would in like manner have paid all the other charges.</p>

            <p>As to which, it was obſerved, That the greateſt part of their Sales by their own ſhowing in the Account, were made even before the 22<hi>d</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> 1721-2. when the Bill was ſent, and by the Anſwers &amp; Schedules, it appears, that a great part of the reſt was ſold and ſhipped oft for <hi>Holland</hi> before ever they could have

an anſwer from the <hi>India Company;</hi> ſo that the not payment of their Bill in time (which ſtill no way appears to be ſo) could not be any cauſe of theſe Sales; but the ſaid <hi>Hett</hi> &amp; <hi>Freſneau</hi> muſt have been Conſcious to themſelves of their breach of Truſt, in making theſe Sales, ſeeing neither when they drew that Bill nor afterwards, did they acquaint the Company of theſe Sales, as appears by their Letters; and is confeſſed in the 3<hi>d Anſwer, fol.</hi> 30. &amp; 4<hi>th Anſwer, fol.</hi> 21, 22, which Conſciouſneſs ſtill further appears by the 2<hi>d Anſwer, fol.</hi> 24. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they confeſs, they wrote two Letters to the <hi>India Company</hi> for leave to ſell, being willing to ſecure themſelves in the Sale, by the expreſs conſent of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,</hi> as well as by <hi>D' Roſſel</hi>'s Power; which leave was not granted, but the <hi>India Company,</hi> by their Letter, ſet forth, in <hi>fol.</hi> 22. of the 2<hi>d Anſwer,</hi> dated 17<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1724. ſay, They had been, informed that 150 Bags of the ſaid Tobacco had been ſent into <hi>Holland,</hi> they could not believe they had ſold ſo much, but deſired them to ſell no more without an Expreſs Order. And upon the whole, concluded, that the 16th Charge was fully made out, and therefore that the Defendants ought not to be allowed the Article of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions of Sales.</p>

As to this, the Defendant <hi>Hett</hi> affixes to his 2<hi>d Anſwer,</hi> a Schedule, which in <hi>fol.</hi> 119. he ſays, <hi>He believes to be a true &amp; full Account of the Snuff receiv'd by the ſaid</hi> Freſneau &amp; Hett, <hi>and applied to their uſe, allowances being made for the Damage thereof.</hi> Which Schedule contains 137 Bags, weighing Neat 20628 <hi>l.</hi> whereof above eighty of the Bags appear to weigh under one Hundred and a half, many only one Hundred, and none of them above two Hundred. To which alſo is affixed an Account of Sales of ten Bags of them by <hi>Vanwys</hi> and <hi>Clarkſon</hi> at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> weighing there groſs 1934.

Upon which it was obſerved, That it does at laſt hereby appear, that they took to themſelves, On this pretence of allowances, what of the Snuff they pleaſed, and called it what weight they pleaſed: and that how faithful they were herein, to their Truſt, &amp; how Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able this was to the character of Honeſt men, could not be hard to determine. And that from the ſchedules to the 2<hi>d Anſwer,</hi> it plainly appears, it was not <hi>Ten, Twelve</hi> or <hi>Twenty Pounds per Bag</hi> that ſatisfied them, in ſo far as not one of the 137 Bags weighed above <hi>Two Hundred,</hi> and yet of the particulars of the ſame 137 Bags, one bag weigh's 266 <hi>l.

And that notwithſtanding the Defendant <hi>Hetts</hi> denyal upon Oath, as aforeſaid, of the Sale of any more Snuff than what's in the ſaid ſchedules, and ſaying, <hi>he had given a full account,</hi> yet it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Depoſition of <hi>John Waldron,</hi> that the nine bags ſold to him, credited in the account, he bought at <hi>Eight pence half penny per Pound;</hi> By the ſame Depoſition, it alſo appears, that <hi>John Waldran</hi> bought afterwards of <hi>Freſneau</hi> &amp; <hi>Hett</hi> fourteen bags at <hi>Nine pence per Pound,</hi> and that both parcels he had out of Coll. <hi>Lurtings</hi> Store-houſe, &amp; underſtood by <hi>Hett</hi> &amp; <hi>Freſneau,</hi> that it was of the Cargo of the Ship <hi>Victory;</hi> and for which nine bags he gives Credit only at <hi>Eight Pence;</hi> and for the fourteen bags, no Credit is given, nor diſcovery thereof made, by the Anſwers or ſchedules.

That he and <hi>Freſneau</hi> ſince the 17<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1724. have not nor either of them hath ſold any Tobacco or Snuff, yet it appears by the Depoſition of the ſaid <hi>John Waldron</hi> that ſince the Death or <hi>Freſneau</hi> (who by the Depoſitions of <hi>Hammond</hi> and <hi>Goelet</hi> herein after-mentioned, appears to be living Long after the 17<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi> 1724) he bought of the Defendant <hi>Hett</hi> ſix bags of Snuff weighing 1151 at <hi>Nine Pence half penny per Pound,</hi> which he underſtood to be of the <hi>Victorys</hi> Cargo, as aforeſaid. And by the Depoſition of <hi>John Lafont</hi> it appears that in the Month of <hi>November,</hi> 1725. he bought of the Defendant <hi>Hett</hi> one bag weighing <hi>One hundred three Quaters</hi> and <hi>ſix Pounds</hi> at <hi>Eleven pence per Pound,</hi> and that <hi>Hett</hi> told him, it remained in his hands on the Account of <hi>D' Roſſel.</hi> And by the Depoſition of <hi>Jacobus Goelet</hi> it appears, that in the year 1725. about <hi>May</hi> or <hi>June,</hi> he bought a bag of Snuff of the Defendant <hi>Hett,</hi> and that Mr. <hi>Freſneau</hi> was not preſent when he bought the ſame, for which he gave <hi>Fourteen Pounds Eleven Shillings,</hi> and <hi>Hett</hi> b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Yet notwithſtanding theſe ſeveral Denyals upon Oath, what appears by the Reports of the Examiner and Maſter, of the 9th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt, herein before ſet forth, and by the Depoſition of <hi>Jean Lafont,</hi> who ſays, <hi>That the Twenty Barrels found at</hi> Bieus, <hi>were markt by Mr.</hi> Hett, <hi>Pork and Beef,</hi> and <hi>that he was deſired by</hi> Rene Hett <hi>to keep the ſame ſecret,</hi> and told him, <hi>it remained in his hands upon the account of Mr.</hi> D'Roſſel; <hi>That the Barrels were filled before he came to Mr.</hi> Hetts <hi>houſe, and that</hi> Hett <hi>deſired him to cloſe up the Barrels af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they were filled: That he and Mr.</hi> Hetts <hi>Negroes shut up the Snuff in the Cellar, where it was found by Coll.</hi> Lurting; and <hi>That he was deſired by Mr.</hi> Hett <hi>to keep the ſaid Barrels ſecret.</hi> And by the Depoſition of <hi>Elias Pipon,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>To the beſt of his knowledge</hi> Rene Hett <hi>did tell him that the Snuff found at</hi> Bieus, <hi>and taken by Coll.</hi> Lurting, <hi>was part of a parcel he had bought of</hi> D'Roſſel, <hi>one</hi> Durong <hi>and one</hi> Aſhton: He ſays, <hi>he has ſeen the Barrels, but did not take much notice of the Mark, but believes that one of them was marked with a</hi> (B) ſays, <hi>That the Snuff was lodged in a ſmall Cellar at</hi> Bieus, <hi>and that there was a door to that Cellar, but that the ſame was Concealed by Boards, and another Door laid a-croſs the ſame, and that ſtancheons were placed ſo as to ſecure the ſaid Boards and Door from falling;</hi> and <hi>that he believes the ſame was intended to be kept ſecret.</hi> And all which being compared with what appears upon the 9<hi>th Charge</hi> herein before-mentioned, and other Circumſtances of this Affair, make it evident, That theſe twenty Barrels of Snuff were part of the Snuff in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, clandeſtinely concealed by the ſaid Defendant <hi>Hett.</hi> And as to ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping off more Snuff than in the ſchedules mentioned, and to other places, it appears by a Letter, duely proved to be in the hand writing of <hi>Sarah Hett,</hi> Daughter of the Defendant <hi>Hett,</hi> and ſigned by the ſaid Defendant <hi>Hett's</hi> own hand writing, bearing date the 27th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1725. and directed to Mr. <hi>Peter Funnel</hi> of <hi>Boſton,</hi> That the Defendant <hi>Hett</hi> thereby ſent him the Invoice and Bill of Lading for four Barrels of Snuff, whereof the Bill of Lading men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Flour; that he ſays, he had reaſons for that, and deſired him to keep it ſecret, and Ship it off for <hi>London</hi> or <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and to tell him whether there

And that as he found Mr.</hi> Hett <hi>was acting the unjuſt part by him, (as well as by the Fatherleſs Children of Mr.</hi> Freſneau) <hi>was the occaſion of ſending</hi> Hett's <hi>Original Letters, that it may bring the Affair more eaſily to light.</hi> And by the Depoſition of <hi>William Beekman,</hi> Mariner, it appears, the Defendant <hi>Hett,</hi> ſent about two years ago four Barrels, for which he gave Bills of Lading as Flour, and carried them to <hi>Boſton:</hi> That his <hi>Negro,</hi> by his order, rolled them out, and came afterwards to the Deponent, and told him, that the Barrels blowed much, and made him ſneeze, and that he was ſure it was not Flour, but Snuff; whereupon the Deponent complained to Mr. <hi>Funnel,</hi> to whom they were ſent, of the Riſqueing his Veſſel, by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Snuff inſtead of Flour; who replyed, <hi>He knew not what to think of it;</hi> and ſays, that to the beſt of his Remembrance, Mr. <hi>Funnel</hi> told him, it was Snuff: And further ſaith, That one <hi>Rolls,</hi> a Mariner, told him, That about two years ago the ſaid <hi>Hett</hi> had ſent four Barrels by him, as Flour, to <hi>Boſton;</hi> and that in the Impoſt-Office at <hi>Boſton,</hi> it was diſcovered to be Snuff, which put him to trouble there. And by the Depoſition of <hi>Thomas Hammond,</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that in the year 1724<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on or about the Month of <hi>October,</hi> Mr. <hi>Rene Hett</hi> in Company with Mr. <hi>Freſneau,</hi> propoſed to him, That if he would take any Snuff on board, on his, <hi>Hett's</hi> account, the Deponent ſhould have half of the neat produce of what he ſold for, not mentioning any quantity, that being left to the Deponent to take what he pleaſed: That the Deponent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, <hi>He would not do any ſuch thing, for the conſequence thereof would be dangerous to his Captain and himſelf.</hi> Upon which Proofs, it was inſiſted, That tho' they don't expreſly prove that the Snuff ſo ſhipt off for <hi>Boſton,</hi> and offered to be ſhipt, as above, was of the Cargo of the Ship <hi>Victory,</hi> depoſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as aforeſaid, yet conſidering ſo great a Wantage there is of it, as before appears, and the ſeveral fraudulent and ſecret Circumſtances by theſe Proofs, and other the Proofs before, to the other Charges, appearing, and that there's no Proof that the Defendant <hi>Hett</hi> had, or that this was of any other Snuff, and that had it been of any other Snuff, there was no need of ſuch diſguiſes
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:003019_0034_0FEFA0F36CAA99D0"/>
and ſecrecy; for no Man can be afraid or aſhamed to own what is his own; and that People are generally more ſaving of their own Effects, than to offer one half of the neat produce for the Sale of them; and that from thence, there's the moſt violent Preſumption (which amounts to full Proof) that this, as well as the twenty Barrels concealed at <hi>Bieus,</hi> was of the Cargo of the <hi>Victory,</hi> depoſited as aforeſaid; and alſo, there's a like preſumption, that the reſt of the Snuff wanting, has been in ſuch fraudulent manner concealed and made away with; and that therefore Notwithſtanding of the ſeveral poſitive Denyals upon Oath, by the Defendant <hi>Hett,</hi> in his Anſwers, of the matters of this 19<hi>th</hi> Charge, the ſame appears fully to be made good.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Proof of Charge XIX.</label>
As to this, It appears confeſſed by the Defendants <hi>Anſwers,</hi> That Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize was bought in <hi>Holland</hi> for the price of the Snuff ſhipped by <hi>Hett</hi> and <hi>Freſneau;</hi> that they had other Moneys there at that time, with which goods were alſo bought, and ſo it came to be mixt in their Trade afterwards, ſo that they can't render an Account of the Profits by Trade there-with. And from Authorities ſhown, it was inſiſted on to be apparent, That it was the antient Law of <hi>England,</hi> and that its now the continued Courſe of the Chancery at home, to compel Executors and Truſtees trading with the Teſtators or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſters Money, or letting it to Intereſt, to account for the Profits of the Trade, or to pay ſuch Intereſt; and that the Laws of Nature and Nations, and of common Reaſon, were accordingly: And that all the Reaſon of theſe caſes, was here, and much more, in ſo far as ſo great a number of <hi>Frauds, Perjuries</hi> and <hi>foul-Dealings</hi> do Evidently appear in this caſe, beſide what fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may be preſumed; and ſo great a number of <hi>Contrivances</hi> of <hi>Delay</hi> and <hi>Vexation</hi> to tne Complainants, in the Courſe of this Suit, to hinder the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Juſtice, that the like of both, has not in any one caſe, in all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, ever appeared.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, and hearing what could be alledged by the Council for the Complainants, and for the Executors of <hi>Andrew Freſneau</hi> (the Defendant <hi>Hetts</hi> Council not attending, as aforeſaid) and upon mature Deliberation had thereon, this Court was of Opinion, and did Order and Decree accordingly.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Charges 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Decreed on.</label>
THAT the firſt Eight Charges in the Bill appeared to be ſufficiently made good, and therefore, that the Defendants do come to a fair account with the Complainants.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Charge IX. Decreed on.</label>
That Notwithſtanding the Probabilities, Reaſons, Arguments and Caſe cited, to make good this Charge, this Court cannot determine that <hi>D'Roſſel</hi> did as is charged.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Charge X. Decreed on.</label>
That what Charges appear to have accrued upon the <hi>French</hi> Goods ſeparately,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:003019_0035_0FEFA0F5001C1F38"/>
ought not to be charged upon the <hi>Spanish Tobacco's;</hi> but what was jointly upon both, this Court ſeeth no method by which a proportion can be made; and had not the <hi>French Goods</hi> been joined, it appeareth not but that there might have been the ſame Charge upon the <hi>Spanish</hi> alone.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Charge XI. Decreed on.</label>
That ſuch Debts as were contracted by Charges in Defence of the <hi>Spanish Tobacco's,</hi> by <hi>D'Roſſel,</hi> and paid by the Defendants ſince his departure, ought to be Chargeable on the <hi>Spanish Tobacco's,</hi> but his other Debts not Chargeable thereon.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Charge XII. Decreed on.</label>
That ſuch part of the Articles as appear to have been, <hi>bona fide,</hi> paid on account of the <hi>Spanish Tobacco's,</hi> be allowed.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Charge XIII. Decreed on.</label>
If, <hi>bona fide,</hi> given for ſervices concerning the <hi>Spanish Tobacco's,</hi> the gifts to be allowed, but not the <hi>Seventeen and a half per Cent.</hi> Commiſſions, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than as herein after directed.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Charge XIV. Decreed on.</label>
No Diſpute about.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Charge XV. Decreed on.</label>
That neither the <hi>Five per Cent.</hi> for Receiving the Snuff and Tobacco, nor the <hi>Five per Cent.</hi> for the Delivery thereof, ought to be allowed the Defendants, but that what is Reaſonable for their Pains, Care and Labour about the ſame, be allowed, with Reaſonable Storeage.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Charge XVI. Decreed on.</label>
That the Sales of the Tobacco and Snuff appear to be <hi>Fraudulent,</hi> &amp; made without ſufficient Power, and no abſolute Neceſſity of making them for the Preſervation of the reſt; and therefore no Commiſſions, for making the Sales, ought to be allowed.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Charge XVII. &amp; XVIII. Decreed on.</label>
That the Defendants be accountable for all the Snuff that came to the hands of <hi>Freſneau</hi> and <hi>Hett,</hi> and not delivered to the Complainants, reaſonable Allowance being made for Waſting and Duſting: And that the twenty Casks of Snuff, now in the Cuſtody of <hi>Robert Lurting,</hi> one of the Maſters of this Court, which was concealed in the Cellar of Mrs. <hi>Bieu,</hi> by the Defendant <hi>Hett,</hi> be delivered to the Complainants, as part of the wanting Snuff.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:003019_0036_0FEFA0FA3566C2D8"/>
               <label>Charge XIX.</label>
That the Defendants ſhall not account for the Profits they made by Trading with the Moneys ariſing by their Sales of the Snuff in <hi>Holland</hi> &amp; <hi>England,</hi> But for the neat Produce thereof, and the Intereſt of ſo much thereof as over paid them from ſuch time, as it may be reaſonably ſuppoſed the ſaid Moneys ariſing by the ſaid Sales, might be received here, until they ſhall pay the ſame; and that the Defendants be allowed Intereſt for the Moneys advanced by them, till they were repaid the ſame. And that ſuch Sum or Sums of Money as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear wrongfully to have been received by the Defendants, from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainants, or any of them, that the Defendants account for the ſame, with Intereſt from the time the ſame was received, till it is repaid. But that the Executors of <hi>Freſneau</hi> be chargeable with no more of the <hi>Thirteen hundred and Ninety ſeven Pounds eighteen Shillings</hi> &amp; <hi>three Pence,</hi> paid by the Complainants to the Defendant <hi>Hett,</hi> than for what came to the ſaid Executors hands.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Further Orders of the Court.</note>And this Court was further of Opinion, That what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be the ſeperate Tranſactions alone of <hi>Hett,</hi> he alone is to be accountable for the ſame; and in like manner of <hi>Freſneau;</hi> But that, what ſhall not appear to have been ſeperately Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, they ſhall be joyntly and ſeverally chargeable therewith.</p>
            <p>And in regard that it appears by the Defendant <hi>Hett</hi>'s own ſhowing, in his <hi>firſt Anſwer,</hi> that no more Commiſſions than that of <hi>Five per Cent.</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be agreed about, between him and the Complainants, and that he was only to receive the Charges in Caſh, &amp; to take Bond for the Commiſſions, and that the 1397 <hi>l.</hi> 18 <hi>s.</hi> 3 <hi>d.</hi> was pretended to be the charges, and yet above <hi>Seven and a half per Cent.</hi> Commiſſions do appear in the body of that account, which Account, by the further Anſwers and Proofs, appears not to have been ſhown to the Complainants, till paid by them, and therefore had there been ſuch an Agreement as is ſet forth in the <hi>firſt Anſwer</hi> (which is not proved) it was a mainfeſt <hi>Fraud</hi> and Impoſition, <hi>firſt,</hi> to take <hi>Seven and a half per Cent.</hi> in Caſh for Commiſſions, when only <hi>Five per Cent.</hi> was (pretended to be) agreed about, and afterwards to inſiſt on and take Bond for the ſame thing, ſo before paid in Caſh, and over paid; and it being agreeable to the Rules of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Equity and Juſtice, that no man take benefit by his own <hi>Frauds,</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and unjuſt Actions, and to Relieve Perſons deceived, from Cheats and Impoſitions put upon them; and it being ſhown to this Court, by the continued Practice of the Court of Chancery of <hi>England,</hi> that Relief is there had againſt Bonds, Deeds or any other Writings whatſoever, where <hi>Fraud</hi> and Impoſition was the Cauſe of the making them; and that in Caſes much Leſs apparent than this, and becauſe none of the matters ſet forth in any of the Defendants <hi>four Anſwers,</hi> appear proved to juſtify this pretence of <hi>Ten per Cent.</hi> Commiſſions for Receiveing and delivering the Tobacco's depoſited with <hi>Hett</hi> &amp; <hi>Freſneau</hi> (for <hi>Five per Cent.</hi> whereof, its confeſſed, this Bond was granted) &amp; for that the pretence of an Agreement by <hi>D'Roſſel</hi> to pay thoſe Commiſſions, ſet forth in the Defendant <hi>Hetts</hi> Affidavit, in order to entitle him to Commiſſions to Examine beyond Seas, ſeemeth very Improbable, in ſo far as no Writting or Proof is pretended to prove that Agreement, but the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining of <hi>D'Roſſel;</hi> and that had ſuch an Agreement been, its unlikely that it ſhould have been forgot in every one of the <hi>four Anſwers</hi> of the Defendant
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:003019_0037_0FEFA0FCFA454068"/>
               <hi>Hett;</hi> And for that were it proved, its apparent, that neither the <hi>India Company</hi> nor <hi>D'Roſſel</hi> had Power to charge theſe Tobacco's with any thing further than the neceſſary Charges concerning the ſame, and ſo ſuch Agreement would be Void, as being made by one who had no Power to make it. And upon the whole, this Court was further of Opinion, and did therefore Order &amp; Decree, That the Bond entered into by <hi>Pacheco, De Lara</hi> and <hi>De Coſta,</hi> in 1500 <hi>l.</hi> to the Defendant <hi>Hett,</hi> dated the 25th of <hi>November,</hi> 1725. Conditioned for the Payment of <hi>Five Pounds</hi> for every Hundred Pounds worth of Snuff he ſhould deliver to them, for the uſe of Meſſieurs <hi>Solomon De Medina, Moſeſſon</hi> and Company, remainder of the Cargo of the <hi>Victory,</hi> every Pound weight of Snuff to be accounted at <hi>Eleven Pence,</hi> and that within three Months after the delivery thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Be, and the ſame Bond then was Decreed to be, utterly void and of none effect; and the Defendant <hi>Hett</hi> then was ordered and decreed to bring, or cauſe the ſame to be brought into this Court to be Cancelled and Deſtroyed; and the ſame Defendant <hi>Rene Hett</hi> then was Ordered and Decreed for ever to deſiſt, from any further or other Proſecution whatſoever, of, or upon, or concerning the ſaid Bond, and perpetual Injunctions were Decreed to iſſue accordingly. And it was further Ordered and Decreed, That the Sheriff of <hi>New-York</hi> do bring into this Court to be Cancelled, the Bail Bond entered into by the Complainant <hi>Pacheco,</hi> and his Securities, upon the Proſecution there againſt him, upon the ſaid Bond to <hi>Hett;</hi> and that the <hi>Ne Exeat</hi> againſt the ſaid <hi>Pacheco</hi> be diſſolved; and that the Sheriff do deliver up the Security, taken thereon, to be Cancelled; And that the Defendant <hi>Hett,</hi> do pay to the Complainants, their Coſts at Law, and in Equity, occaſioned by the Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the aforeſaid Bond and <hi>Ne Exeat;</hi> and that the Defendants do pay to the Complainants the full Coſts of this Suit.</p>
            <p>And it was then referred to <hi>Robert Lurting</hi> and <hi>Cadwallader Colden,</hi> Eſqrs. to ſettle the ſaid Accounts, according to the directions of this Court, and to tax the Coſts, and to make Report thereof to this Court, with all convenient Expedition.</p>
            <p>Which Matters ſo Decreed and Ordered, as aforeſaid, were ordered to be Abſolute, in ſo far as the ſame was againſt the Executors of <hi>Freſneau;</hi> But in regard that no Council for the Defendant <hi>Hett</hi> appeared, the ſame were only to be Abſolute againſt the Defendant <hi>Hett,</hi> if no ſufficient Cauſe was ſhewed, either to this Court, to the contrary, on the Twenty third Day of the ſaid Month of <hi>December</hi> (his Excellency being to depart the next day thereafter for his Government of <hi>New-Jerſey</hi>) Or to the Maſters to whom the ſaid Matters were referred, upon their Second Summons.</p>

                           <p>That as to the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe Cauſes, we conceived our ſelves no ways ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to take any notice thereof, being a thing ſet forth to have been adjudged by your Excellency. As to the <hi>Second Cauſe,</hi> It appears to us by the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in this Cauſe, before hearing (and which by the Orders aforeſaid, are ſaid to have appeared on hearing) that after allowance for Waſting &amp; Duſting, and other proper allowances, and after ſubſtracting the twenty Casks of Snuff concealed at <hi>Bieu's,</hi> there ſtill remains 2532 Pounds Weight of Snuff want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as more fully appears by the Account of the Snuff hereunto annex'd, Marked <hi>No.</hi> 1. And therefore, that the <hi>Second Cauſe</hi> was of no weight. We therefore gave a third Summons for the Partys to attend us on the Eighth day of <hi>January</hi> laſt, and a fourth to attend as on the Twelfth day of the ſame Month; on all which Summonſes the Complainants Council appeared, but none in behalf of either of the Defendants, at any of theſe times, except on the ſecond Summons, to deliver us the Writting aforeſaid, tho' every of the ſaid Summonſes appeared to us by Oath, to be duly ſerved.

allow of ſundry Articles and parts of Articles to ſtand charged in the Defendants Account, without making any objection to them, tho' no ſufficient Proof ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the Proceedings, that theſe Sums were paid, nor of any reaſonable cauſe for which they might have been paid, and that only from the Poſſibility that ſome ſuch Sums might have been paid by the Defendants, for theſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes; and alſo, Except in this, that it not appearing clearly when the Sums paid out by the Defendants, were paid out; and it alſo not appearing clearly by the Proceedings, when the produce of the Sales came into the Defendants hands, and becauſe of the Intricacy that muſt of courſe ariſe there-from, to compute the Intereſt to the Partys to whom, from time to time, a Ballance was due: By the conſent of the <hi>Complainants</hi> &amp; their <hi>Council,</hi> we have not conſider'd of this Article, further than to find that the Ballances were moſtly againſt the Defendants, and that ſeeing the Complainants were willing to wave that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, we were wiling to ſave our ſelves the trouble of computing how much the Intereſt of the Ballances amounted to until the payment of the 1397 <hi>l.</hi> 18 <hi>s.</hi> 3 <hi>d.</hi> by the Complainants to the Defendant <hi>Hett,</hi> before which, we find, there was a Ballance due to the Complainants of <hi>Eighty two Pounds</hi> and <hi>One Penny,</hi> the Intereſt whereof the Complainants were alſo willing to wave till the date of the Decretal Order (the Complainants however proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that theſe Allowances and Wavings of theirs might be no Barr to them to Diſpute theſe Matters, if the Defendants appeared, but that they might inſiſt on their whole Due, if they ſhould then ſo think it proper) and therefore we have only computed Intereſt upon the ſaid 1397 <hi>l.</hi> 18 <hi>s.</hi> 3 <hi>d.</hi> till the Decretal Order; and upon the whole, conſidered, as aforeſaid, we find that on the twenty ſecond day of <hi>December</hi> laſt, the Defendants owed the Complainants (beſides the Delivering up of the 1500<hi>l.</hi> Bond for Commiſſions of Delivery) the Sum of <hi>Seventeen hundred</hi> &amp; <hi>Eleven Pounds, Seventeen Shillings</hi> &amp; <hi>One Penny,</hi> as the Ballance of the Accounts ſtated, as by the Account annexed, marked <hi>No.</hi> 2.

                           <p>We do alſo find, that the Defendant <hi>Hett</hi> was ſolely chargeable with <hi>Fourteen Hundred</hi> and <hi>Seven Pounds Fourteen Shillings</hi> and <hi>Four Pence half Penny</hi> of the ſaid Ballance of <hi>Seventeen Hundred</hi> and <hi>Eleven Pounds Seventeen Shillings</hi> and <hi>One Penny,</hi> and that the Executors of <hi>Freſneau,</hi> deceaſed, are ſolely Charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with the Sum of <hi>Two Hundred</hi> and <hi>Ninety One Pounds Ten Shillings</hi> thereof.</p>
                           <p>And we find the Defendants, jointly and ſeverally Chargeable with <hi>Twelve Pounds Twelve Shillings</hi> and <hi>Eight Pence half Penny,</hi> the remainder of the ſaid Ballance, as plainly will appear by the Account annexed, marked <hi>No.</hi> 3.</p>
                           <p>The Accounts having appeared to us in ſubſtance, as aforeſaid, we on the Fourteenth of this Inſtant <hi>February,</hi> iſſued a fifth Summons for the Parties to attend us on the Sixteenth of the ſame Month, in order to the final Settlement of the Accounts, and making our Report thereof: which Summons being duly ſerved, the Council for the Complainants appeared, as did thoſe of the Defendant <hi>Hett,</hi> to whom the Accounts, ſo far as then Drawn out in form, were then ſhown, &amp; they deſiring a Copy of the ſame, we anſwered, that giving Copies of a part would cauſe an unneceſſary Delay, but as ſoon as the Accounts ſhould be finiſhed, they ſhould have a Copy (if deſired) of the Accounts, and of our Report together, to make their Objections to them.

            <p>Afterwards, to wit, the 2<hi>d</hi> day of <hi>March,</hi> 1727-8. Capt. <hi>Matthew Norris,</hi> Commander of his Majeſty's Ship <hi>Lowſtaff,</hi> Preſented a Petition to this Court, ſetting forth, <hi>That the Complainants in this Suit, ſued as Agents for the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>That he had Orders to ſeize</hi> Spaniſh Ships <hi>and</hi> Effects, <hi>as in time of War, that he had lately Seized</hi> 4OO <hi>Bags of Snuff, part of the ſame Cargo, and Libelled it in the Court of Admiralty, and after regular Proceedings there, that it no way appeared the Property was altered from the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>and therefore the ſame was Condemned;</hi> and therefore Prayed, <hi>That what might be Decreed in this Suit, might be to his Majeſty's Uſe.</hi> Whereupon it was Ordered, That Cauſe be ſhown, on <hi>Fryday</hi> then next, Why the Prayer of the ſaid Petition ſhould not be granted? And now at this Day, to wit, the 8<hi>th</hi> day of <hi>March,</hi> 1727-8. upon Notice duely given, it was moved, That the Report of the Maſters aforeſaid ſhould be read, Which being accordingly read, it was moved, That the ſame be abſolutely Confirmed, &amp; that this Court would Decree accordingly. Which Motion <hi>Joſeph Murray</hi> and <hi>William Smith,</hi> Council for the Defendant <hi>Hett,</hi> appearing, did oppoſe, and inſiſted upon their Exceptions to the Decree in the ſaid Maſters Report. To which it was Anſwered by the Complainants Council, That it was entirely irregular to Offer any thing to that purpoſe at
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:003019_0043_0FEFA1105A894DF0"/>
this time, in ſo far as they have had time enough to file their Exceptions to the Maſters Report, according to the courſe of the Court, if they conceived their Clyent wronged thereby; And that it was unprecedented to Offer any thing againſt a Report, without Exceptions thereto firſt duely filed. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this Court did order the Depoſitions and Proofs in this Cauſe to be brought, and ſo much thereof as related to the Exceptions in the ſaid Maſters Report, to be read; And the matter being debated by the Council of both ſides, this Court was of Opinion, <hi>That the ſaid Report do ſtand Confirmed, if no further matter appeared why the ſame ſhould not.</hi> Whereupon the ſaid <hi>Joſeph Murray,</hi> of Council for Capt. <hi>Norris,</hi> moved and inſiſted, that <hi>James Alexander,</hi> Council for the Complainants, ſhould be ordered by this Court as Advocate-General of of this Province, to ſupport the ſaid Petition of Capt. <hi>Norris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon the ſaid <hi>James Alexander</hi> Surrendered to his Excellency his Commiſſion as Advocate General, and prayed his Surrender might be accepted of, and that he might not be ſo Compelled. Which Surrender being accepted of, Cauſe was ſhowed why the ſaid Petition ſhould not be granted, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the <hi>firſt</hi> Fact therein alledged, That it appeared by the Bill and 2<hi>d Anſwer,</hi> That this Suit was for Relief to <hi>Medina</hi> and Company, for the Snuff wanting, and to the bearers of their Orders, for the 1397<hi>l.</hi> 18 <hi>s.</hi> 3 <hi>d.</hi> and the 1500 <hi>Pounds</hi> Bond in their own Right, and not as Agents to any Perſons.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> As to his Orders, it appeared they were from the Admiralty, who had no Juriſdiction or Power beyond High-Water Mark, &amp; therefore his Orders of no further extent; and that he could not by virtue thereof Enter into any houſe here lawfully, to Execute his Orders, by ſeizing upon any thing; and that it was notorious, that the Preliminary Articles of Pacfication were ſigned on the part of <hi>England</hi> long ago, and that we have had ſeveral accounts that they are now ſo on the part of <hi>Spain;</hi> for both which Reaſons, tho' the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in queſtion had been the King of <hi>Spains,</hi> (which they expreſly denyed) he ought not to intermedle himſelf in this Affair; and as no other Perſon here had any Orders or Power to ſeize or affect the matter in queſtion, then nothing could lawfully affect it.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> As to the Property being in the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and that the Admiralty could ſee nothing that had altered it; It was inſiſted, That was no Reaſon why this Court, or any other Court, might not ſee Evidence to prove it was altered. And thereupon it was inſiſted, That the Ambaſſador of <hi>Spain's</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to the <hi>India Company,</hi> to cauſe the Tobacco's to be delivered to <hi>Medina</hi> and Company, with their Orders accordingly, and the acceptance of them by the Defendant <hi>Hett,</hi> was by the Laws of Nature, of Nations, and of Merch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, a ſufficient veſting of the Property in Medina and Company, unleſs there was an expreſs Truſt proved; which in this caſe appeared not. Whereupon <hi>Joſeph Murray,</hi> of Council for Capt. <hi>Norris,</hi> prayed further time to Anſwer the Cauſes ſhowed againſt the ſaid Petition.</p>
            <p>And it appearing to this Court, that as to the 1500 <hi>l.</hi> Bond, and the 1397 <hi>l.</hi> 18<hi>s.</hi> 3<hi>d.</hi> and Intereſt thereof, Relief could only be due to the Complainants <hi>Pacheco, De Lara,</hi> &amp; <hi>De Coſta,</hi> for the ſame, not as Agents to any body, but in their own right.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:003019_0044_0FEFA1138E5FC388"/>Therefore this Court as to ſo much, and the Coſts, did Order the matters herein before Decreed and the ſaid Report to ſtand abſolutely Confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Decreed, to be Obſerved and performed, and the Moneys found due by the ſaid Report, to be paid to the Complainants with Intereſt by all Parties, according to the true intent and meaning thereof.</p>
            <p>And it is this preſent Day, to wit, the Eighth Day of <hi>March,</hi> in the firſt year of the Reign of Our Sovereign Lord <hi>George</hi> the Second of <hi>Great Brittain, France</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> King, Defender of the <hi>Faith</hi> &amp;c.

               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Capt.

            <p>And that as to the remainder <hi>viz.</hi> 82 <hi>l.</hi> 0 <hi>s.</hi> 1 <hi>d.</hi> and the 20 Barrels of Snuff in the Cuſtody of <hi>Robert Lurting,</hi> that the ſame Report and Decree do ſtand alſo abſolutely Confirmed and Decreed, unleſs ſufficient cauſe is ſhown why the ſame ſhould not by Monday next, on the part of Capt. <hi>Norris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it was further moved; becauſe <hi>Cadwallader Colden</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> was gone out of Town, that <hi>Robert Lurting,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> do make the Report of the Coſts to this Court, with all Expedition. Which was Ordered accordingly.</p>
