            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE uncommon mortality which marked the Epidemic, which is the ſubject of the following Eſſay, among his Majeſty's ſea and land forces in the Weſt Indies, during the laſt eighteen months; and the total inefficacy which the uſual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, in ſimilar circumſtances, were found to poſſeſs; will, it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, render any attempt to throw

light on the cauſes, nature, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate treatment of ſo dreadful a malady, at leaſt not unacceptable to the Public.</p>
            <p>You, Gentlemen, are more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly intereſted; as in the courſe of your ſervice you may be led into ſituations, wherein the feelings of humanity, and the duties of your profeſſion, will have urgent demands on you to exert your abilities; but, in which it may happen, from the want of a guide, in circumſtances almoſt altogether new, that the latter may avail you little in alleviating the miſery of the ſufferers intruſted to your care. To no body of men can I therefore, with more propriety,

offer the obſervations contained in the following ſheets, than the very reſpectable one which the Medical Gentlemen of the Britiſh Navy and Army conſtitute.

I hazard the attempt.

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AN anxious wiſh to ſee the ſubject of the following ſheets treated by an abler pen, has hitherto pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the Author from offering the Public this feeble effort to promote their welfare. Finding, however, that nothing adequate to its impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance has appeared; and being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of the poſſeſſion of perhaps more extenſive experience in the
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:035302_0007_100217C5AE92A738"/>
Malignant Peſtilential Fever, than has fallen to the lot of almoſt any practitioner in this country, he thinks it would be acting contrary, to the principles of humanity, as well as the intereſt of the medical profeſſion, ſhould he delay any longer a publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which indeed claims no other merit than truth with reſpect to the ſtatement of facts, and novelty with reſpect to the mode of treatment found ſucceſsful.</p>
            <p>That the Malignant Peſtilential Fever is no rare occurrence in cold climates, has been too fatally expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced.
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:035302_0008_100217C80BCC2440"/>
It is not ſo, however, in hot climates, if we may judge from the writings of medical practitioners; for although ſymptoms of malignan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy have appeared in the Yellow Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of the country, in its advanced ſtage, ſeldom have thoſe of peſtilence ſhewn themſelves; and never has contagion till now, rendered the uſual precautions obſerved in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope againſt the introduction of the Plague, neceſſary.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the following conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may conſtitute a further apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for the Author's intruding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on the Public: It is evident that
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:035302_0009_1002179E0F1E6838"/>
the moſt reſpectable writers on the Malignant Fever have found infinite difficulty in aſcertaining an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate mode of cure: what but this are we to infer from the following paſſages: "I have obſerved before, that a delirium would ariſe from two oppoſite errors; one from large and repeated bleedings; and the other from wine and the cordial me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines being taken too early. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears therefore how nice the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are that regard the cure: thus, neither a hot nor a cool regimen will anſwer with every patient, nor in every ſtate of the diſeaſe."—"Yet
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:035302_0010_100217CBF25CD668"/>
were putrefaction the only change made in the body by contagion, it might be eaſy to cure ſuch fevers by the uſe of acids only, or other antiſeptics. But as the diſeaſe, when once formed, is not to be removed by ſuch means alone, it would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeem as if ſome parts of the brain, or nervous ſyſtem, were early inflamed, and the fever kept up by that inflammation; as if to this circumſtance moſt of the ſymptoms were owing; and, as if in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced ſtate, a cure could not be obtained until the obſtructing matter was reſolved by ſuppuration or putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction."

The Author has not the preſumption to imagine that the happy medium, ſo much wanted, has been diſcovered by him; but he has reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the candid and unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced practitioner may find in the following little Eſſay, ſome obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
<pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:035302_0012_100217D1251145E8"/>
which may throw light on this very obſcure ſubject. It may at leaſt excite the obſerving and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious to attend more to the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar nature of peſtilential inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; to the exhalation of ſerous fluid in the cavities of the brain, and the conſequent compreſſion of that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan; and to the means which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the former without inducing a dangerous ſtate of debility, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the abſorption of the latter in fevers of a ſubſequent nature. No doubt the means here recommended will appear bold, and perhaps empi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical to an European phyſician; but
<pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:035302_0013_1001F75B681BE608"/>
let prejudice be ſet aſide, and let facts only be attended to, and ſure he is, a candid practitioner will find ſufficient encouragement to adopt them. What has been advanced, powerfully militates againſt theory; but how ſeldom are the dogmata of theoriſts found free of fallacy in practice!</p>
            <p>Upon the whole: all the Author aims at, is to relate in a plain and unadorned ſtyle, the reſult of his own experience in one of the moſt dangerous and inſidious diſeaſes the human frame is ſubject to, with the

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>BEFORE I enter on the Hiſtory of the Malignant Peſtilential Fever, which ſo generally prevailed in this and the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring iſlands, I think it may not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to give ſome account of Grenada, as far as relates to the face of the country, its productions, its diſeaſes, and the ſtate of the weather. On ſettling in this iſland, I was convinced that a knowledge of the climate, and of the various changes which take place in the weather throughout the year, would be highly conducive to ſucceſs in the practice of Medicine; and I was the more ſtrongly inclined to obſerve and record theſe, by finding that nothing of the kind had been hitherto done. For this purpoſe I immediately began a diary or journal of the weather; and have ever ſince continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, with few interruptions; but, as a journal of the whole period would be tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:035302_0017_100217D9737AD158"/>
and unneceſſary, I have given only that of the three firſt years; and to illuſtrate my Obſervations on the Malignant Peſtilential Fever, I have added the journal of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the year 1793. Dr. Hillary is the only medical writer I am acquainted with, who has given the public any account of the weather of theſe iſlands; but, although his very able account may be very uſeful to practitioners in Barbadoes, and other iſlands whoſe ſurface is comparatively level, and whoſe hills riſe only to a trifling height, and in no inſtance exhibit the wild and pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tureſque ſcenes of Grenada, St. Vincent, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minica, and a few others, it is not ſo here: and the reaſon is evident. The windings of the innumerable hills in Grenada pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a change of temperature at the end of every hundred yards; under their ſhelter the heat is often almoſt unſupportable, and the body is bathed in the moſt profuſe ſweat: beyond this, turning an angle, and being ſuddenly expoſed to the prevailing winds, which there blow with violence, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to the narrow vallies which confine them, the body is in an inſtant dried up: an aguiſh ſenſation takes place, and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequently
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:035302_0018_100217DB32441E48"/>
topical pains and inflammations of a moſt dangerous nature, are inſtantaneouſly produced. It is from this cauſe, as much as from any other that hepatic and pulmonary inflammations are more frequent, and more violent in theſe rugged mountainous iſlands than in Barbadoes, Antigua, and others of a ſmoother and leſs divided ſurface: and this is the principal cauſe alſo that topical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations, particularly thoſe of the liver, are met with at all ſeaſons, during the hot and rainy as well as the cool and dry: a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance otherwiſe inexplicable. It alſo accounts for the efficacy, as a preventative of any medium between the ſhirt and ſkin, which may abſorb the perſpired fluid, whilſt it keeps up an equal temperature on the ſurface, whatever changes take place in the ſurrounding atmoſphere. Thus, a flannel-ſhirt, however ſtrange it may ſeem to an European not acquainted with the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance above mentioned, is the beſt preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative of health in this iſland, and perhaps throughout the torrid zone.</p>
            <p>The atmoſphere of Grenada differs widely from that of the low iſlands, Barbadoes, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigua,

&amp;c. The innumerable points and ridges of the two mountains, which run nearly north and ſouth, and ſeparate the windward from the leeward diſtricts, arreſt or attract the paſſing clouds. Theſe, either falling in rain, or giving riſe to ſprings, whilſt they fertilize the ſoil, fill the atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere with watery particles. This moiſt ſtate of the atmoſphere exiſts throughout the whole year; but is greater in proportion to the quantity and denſity of the clouds. In the rainy ſeaſon torrents of water ruſh down the craggy ſides of the higher regions of theſe mountains; and the rivulets, often overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their banks by this addition, inundate the country below. In the dry ſeaſon, a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable degree of moiſture is always percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible; but then it falls during the night in the form of dew; and the ſtreams and rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, though plentifully ſupplied, run in their natural channels with a placid current, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept where their courſe is interrupted by precipitous rocks or large ſtones. The at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere of the low iſlands, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, is generally remarkably dry; nor are they bleſſed with the ſtreams and rivers which beautify and benefit Grenada. Hence the temperature in ſituations even not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

to alternate cold and heat, is very irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular; and from this alſo it is ſeldom poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to work an electrical machine with advantage, the fluid collected continually flying off, attracted by the ſurrounding moiſture. From this cauſe too the iſland, ſeen from ſea, is for ever obſcured with clouds; the ſummits of the mountains are almoſt never diſtinguiſhable; and even hills nearer the coaſt, on account of the denſity of the medium through which they are viewed, ſeldom exhibit their true ſhape, height, and colours. The low iſlands are never thus enveloped in miſt, never thus ſeem "ever-threat'ning ſtorms;" their atmoſphere being leſs loaded, becomes a purer medium, and ſeldom lets fall the deluges experienced here. From theſe conſiderations, the following Journal may have its uſe.</p>
            <p>Grenada is one of the moſt ſouthern of the Caribbean iſlands: a ſituation which exempts it from the dreadful hurricanes which frequently lay waſte thoſe farther northward. It is compoſed of two immenſe mountains, which terminate in peaks; but, being united a little below their ſummits
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:035302_0021_100217E2548FAC00"/>
by a gradual ſlope, the diviſion is not at firſt very perceptible. On the windward, or north-eaſt ſide, the deſcent is infinitely more gradual than on the leeward or ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt ſide; nor is it there encumbered with the multitude of conical hills, and rocks of various form and magnitude, which charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſe the latter. So gradual is the riſe of the country in the diſtrict of Marquis and part of Seauteur, as to give the idea of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive plain, moſt beautifully diverſified by gentle ſlopes, rivers, delightful vales, thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets and extenſive cane-fields, and termin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by wooded mountains, whoſe pointed tops are often hid in clouds. The leeward ſide, on the contrary, is mountainous to the very ſea; and the whole is thrown together in the wildeſt and moſt pictureſque manner. Magnitude and boldneſs of deſign are the prevailing features. In general, excepting a part of the windward ſide of the iſland, by ſuppoſing innumerable and diſtinct ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clivities of conical or angular figures, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing in bulk as they are removed from the ſea, crowding on each other, and at length terminating in two enormous piles, whoſe crags and ridges ſhagged with wood,

and whoſe cliffs, often ſeen towering above the floating clouds in auguſt and gigantic forms, exhibit a moſt ſtupendous back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground,—we ſhall be able to conceive a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably juſt idea of the grand outlines of the very ſingular ſcenery of this romantic coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. On more attentively viewing the picture, we find hills precipitous, acclivous, or winding circularly in ſharp inacceſſible ridges, ſo as to form frightful gullies, torn by torrents in the rainy ſeaſon, or deep, dark glens and bounded hollows, ſeldom trod by human foot; where ſtreams, brawling over pebbly beds, or often interrupted in their courſe, and falling over the ſurface of a rocky ſcarp, and collected in ſtony baſons underneath, form ſhady cool retreats; in which alone

caſcades, ſometimes fifty feet in height; but no living creature, except the wood-pigeon; a few ſmall birds, the dappled agootee, and the armadilloe, inhabit theſe wilds. Where cultivation ends, little ſcattered ſpots are ſeen diverſifying this wilderneſs of wood, on which the induſtrious hands of poor ſettlers, chiefly French, have formed ſmall plantations of coffee, intermixed with plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and ſheltered from the rude ſhock of the prevailing north-eaſt wind, by hedges of the ever green calaba<note n="1" place="bottom">Calophyllum Calaba, Linnaei.</note>, whoſe deep ſhade affords an intereſting variegation from the ſurrounding paler green. Alternating with theſe are ſeen neat but ſmall patches, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing all the kitchen can require in the vegetable kingdom; which, continual moiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and coolneſs contributing to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, are ever plentifully raiſed. Beyond this, cultivation takes a larger ſweep, and often with coffee, cacao, cotton, are ſeen fields of ſugar-cane, planted and flouriſhing on the ſteep ſides of hills, or in narrow winding vallies, frequently chequered by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulated cones, or tuſted craggs of groteſque

Here too are ſeen the ſtately mountain-cabbage, and the wide-ſpreading ſilk cotton-trees, towering above all others, in majeſtic pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence: rivers are ſeen winding through every valley, and here and there natural paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are left, on which the cattle and ſtock of neighbouring plantations are ſeen feeding. Farther on, and even to the ſea, where the ſurface admits of cultivation, the whole is covered with the ſugar-cane, regularly plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in oblong fields, ſeparated by hedges of

the lime, the logwood, the Angola-pea, the falſe acacia, the prickly pear, phyſic-nut, &amp;c. Theſe are frequently diverſified by irregular groupes of negroe-huts, ſurrounded by and intermixed with groves of the banana, and arbours of the grenadilla, water-lemon, and various viminious plants of the pea kind. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining theſe romantic groupes, are ſeen the dwelling-houſes, and the works, as they are called, or the buildings erected for the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture of the cane-juice into ſugar; to which not unfrequently are attached orchards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a great variety of indigenous and exotic fruit-trees. In detached corners alſo are ſeen the gardens or proviſion-grounds of the negroes, planted according to the whim or taſte of the temporary owner; and here and there the tops of conical hills, too ſteep or too barren for culture, crowned with tufts of natural wood, become intereſting objects, from the variety of tints they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce.</p>
            <p>The coaſt in many places terminates ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly in rocky precipices, the face of which is often curiouſly perforated into caverns, arches, &amp;c. by the continual daſhing of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035302_0026_100217EC8B8FEE30"/>
the ſea againſt it. The tops of theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices are ſometimes fertile, but more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally either a bare ſoft rock, probably a volcanic production, called by the inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, Tuf, or producing a curious ſpecies of cyperus, intermixed with trees of the erect prickly pear, or the Abyſſinian koll-quall of Mr. Bruce. In other places, it runs out into long narrow points, frequently end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in high cliffs of tuf, but more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in curious rocks or congeries of the Madripore coralline, the cells of which neareſt the ſea, and occaſionally overflowed by it, are inhabited by zoophytes, litho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phytes, and animals of the Molluſca-tribe. Theſe points are ſeldom covered with much ſoil, but generally ſerve well for ſheep and goat paſtures. They form ſmall but conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient and deep bays, particularly on the ſouth-eaſt coaſt. Some of theſe bays inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate themſelves ſo far into the country, as, when ſeen in certain points of view, to have all the ornamental effect of winding lakes; and at Calivini, Bacaye, and a few other places, they have the additional beauty of fine ſloping woods, intermixed with lawns of the brighteſt green, and a back ground of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035302_0027_100217EEB96D9190"/>
pictureſque ſcenes in the interior country. Sometimes, however, the coaſt trends cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly for ſeveral miles; low, ſandy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſingle inlet, and protected from the encroachments of the ocean, which beats againſt it with all the additional force of the eaſterly or trade-wind, by a prodigious bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier of corallines. Rivers being here fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſhut up by mounds of looſe ſand thrown up in their mouths by the violence of the ſurf, much ſtagnant water and marſhy tracts are found, at all times corrupting the air to leeward of them for ſeveral miles; theſe diſtricts therefore, although incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the richeſt, and in many reſpects the moſt beautiful, are the moſt inimical to health of any of the iſland.</p>
            <p>All along the coaſt, a prodigious variety of corallines, of every form, ſtretch from the north-eaſt round eaſterly to the ſouth-weſt: the bottom almoſt everywhere in that direction is formed of them, at leaſt a league in breadth; and in ſome places, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly off the ſouth-eaſt, extenſive ſubma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine groves, of a moſt beautiful muricated madripore, are ſeen, chiefly of a bright pink-colour.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:035302_0028_100217F221C69F28"/>
Theſe coralline-beds and groves are frequently extremely dangerous to ſhipping. They are often fiſhed up for the purpoſe of making lime, which they anſwer tolerably well in temporary buildings; but the lime manufactured from them, poſſeſſes by no means the ſtrength of the ſtone-lime. The tranſparency of the water over theſe coral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines is ſo remarkably great, that the bottom can be diſtinctly ſeen at the depth of ten and fifteen fathoms; and on taking a view of the coaſt from any conſiderable adjoining height, the whitiſh or light green colour of the ſea, clearly points out the limits of theſe curious productions. Every where on their ſurface vaſt quantities of echini and aſterias are found; the former troubleſome and even dangerous, by their long and ſtrong prickles, or ſpines. They conſtitute alſo the ſecure abode, except in ſtormy weather, of innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable crabs, ſea cray-fiſh and univalve ſhell-fiſh: of the laſt of which there is a great and beautiful variety. Many ſpecies of the ſpunge, particularly the flabelliform, the feſtularis, the aculeata, and the nodoſa, alſo, lodge on theſe lithophyte-beds. Vaſt numbers of excellent ſmall fiſh are always
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:035302_0029_100217F3B538E4A8"/>
found within the limits of the corallines, particularly where marine vegetables a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound; but the larger kinds reſort to the ſand-banks a few leagues to leeward of the iſland, or are caught in deep water, where no corallines are found.</p>
            <p>From the ſouth-weſt to the north-eaſt, along the weſtern ſhore, no corallines are ever ſeen, the coaſt being amazingly bold and precipitous; and the ſhore where the bottom is ſhelving being covered with ſtones of the quartzoſe and ſhorl kinds, quad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangular, priſmatic, or oval, and of a bluiſh grey colour; either thrown up by the ſea, or the produce of its encroachment on the adjoining high rocky cliffs. Theſe, on this part of the coaſt, are often overhanging in an awful and tremendous manner, and (the road running underneath) have been not unfrequently fatal to paſſengers, particularly after very ſtormy weather; during which, the ſea beating with dreadful violence againſt their lower ſtrata, has ſhaken the whole maſs, and looſened and disjoined large fragments. Together with theſe are
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:035302_0030_100217F54CFCBCD0"/>
frequently found ſome beautiful ſpecies of the pyrites, chiefly of a yellow and dark blue.<note n="3" place="bottom">On two parts of this coaſt, the moſt regular ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaltes I ever ſaw, form two points, exactly reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling at a diſtance the huge fluted columns of Gothic Churches.

Theſe are moſt perfect between Black Bay and Grand Roy, where the inhabitants call them the "organs;" and though not ſo extenſive as the ſingular baſaltes of Staffa, as repreſented by the celebrated Sir Joſeph Banks, are evidently ſimilar in every reſpect.</note>

ſemi-tranſparent ſheath, perhaps of its own conſtruction, always contained in a tubular hole in rocks, two or three feet under the ſurface of the water. From this it puſhes out and expands its tentacula in queſt of food; but draws all in on the ſlighteſt appearance of danger; ſo that it is extremely difficult to procure one uninjured. The tentacula of this ſpecies, when ſpread out by the animal, form a ſeeming flower, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly reſembling the larger paſſeflora, or granadilla. The length of the body, which has much the appearance of that of the larger ſcolopendra, is about five or ſix inches, and marked with innumerable annular ridges, which near the mouth, or tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula, are more diſtinct and prominent.—Theſe annuli terminate on each ſide in very minute claws or feet, which ſerve the animal in creeping out of its ſheath, to a limited length, in queſt of food. The ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacula are of a moſt ſingular ſtructure, and variegated with a number of beautiful co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, the moſt conſpicuous of which are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and yellow. Each tentaculum is about two or three inches in length, and plumoſe, or formed in the manner of the plumae or
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:035302_0032_100217FA88F165F0"/>
laminae, of feathers, the beards of which are endowed with exquiſite feeling, for on the ſlighteſt undulation of the water, or ſtriking gently the veſſel containing it, they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly erected, and exhibit a ſingular and moſt beautiful aſſemblage of colours. If the undulation of the water is increaſed, or if any of the tentacula are ſlightly touched, the animal inſtantly, and with aſtoniſhing quickneſs, withdraws into its ſheath or habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and nothing is apparently ſeen but a piece of ill-looking membranaceous ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weed.</p>
            <p>The ſoil of Grenada may be divided into four kinds: 1ſt. A black rich mould, found chiefly in low vallies, and on the gentle ſlopes of the more rounded hills. 2d. A mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of light ſand and black mould, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally found near the ſea, and containing a large portion of ſea-ſalt. 3d. A mixture of black mould, ſand, and a metallic earth, of a reddiſh colour, found in the ſteeper parts of what may be called the ſecond region of the iſland, or where cultivation is extended with difficulty. 4th. A red earth, or ochre, frequently intermixed with black ſhining
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:035302_0033_100217FC1DEEC010"/>
metallic particles, ſterile, and incapable of culture with even the aid of the ſtrongeſt manure. This is generally found in the higher parts of the mountainous country, ſometimes covered with wood and a coarſe long graſs; but oftener naked, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a fine effect contraſted with the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding green. The depth of theſe varies very much: in ſome places it is only a few inches; in others, particularly in deep val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, ſeveral feet, and evidently there, the accumulation of the waſhings from the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining hills in the rainy ſeaſon: in other places, particularly where the ſoft rocky ſubſtance, called Tuf, prevails (probably the tuffa<note n="4" place="bottom">In Sir William Hamilton's account of the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes which happened in Calabria, from February to May 1783, letter of the 23d of May, mention is made of this volcanic ſubſtance.

Generally, under this coat of ſoil there is a rocky ſubſtance, ſoft where it is connected to the ſoil, and hardening as it deepens. It is followed, in many places, by curious ſtrata of argillaceous rock, which are ſeparated from each other by ſtrata or layers of black mould, frequently mixed with ſhells of the cochlea kind, and ſome marine productions of the teſtaceous tribe, particularly various turbines and bivalves. Alternate ſtrata thus formed are often found in excavated places many hundred feet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſurface. They generally obſerve the inclination or angle which the hill or val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley in which they are found, makes with the horizon: thus, ſome are oblique, others hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal; and in proportion to the depth, the hardneſs of the argillaceous ſtrata increaſes. In other places, under the ſoil is a thick bed of ſtone, the production probably of vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canic

Theſe, as they deepen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more ſoft and crumbly; but always retain their form, till at length they are ſo united with a yellowiſh earth, as ſcarcely to be diſtinguiſhable from it. In places ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavated perpendicularly, and long expoſed to the weather, theſe imperfect cryſtaliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, if they may be called ſuch, are ſeen ſeparated from the earthy matter connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and hanging in the manner of iſicles, and diſplaying their form with the utmoſt exactneſs. In the yellowiſh earth underneath theſe quadrilateral maſſes, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtones of a bright ſhining blue are found ſingle, and of a depreſſed oval ſhape. Many hills, particularly thoſe which are of a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical form, have, under the ſoil, ſtrata of a ſubſtance much reſembling calx at firſt ſight; but on examination, found to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined ſtones and aſhes, compreſſed into la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minae. Theſe laminae are ſeparated from each other by a greyiſh earth, mixed with innumerable ſmall pebbles, much uſed in making mortar.</p>

The diſtrict of St. George's pariſh, called Point Saline, forming an iſoſceles triangle, the baſe of which may be four miles in length, is almoſt entirely compoſed of the ſoft rocky ſubſtance, called Tuff; and fully a third of it is deſtitute of ſoil, except here and there in little hollows and fiſſures; or where the ſurface of the tuf, ſoftened by the action of the air, has become a kind of vegetative earth. The whole of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe maſs is made up of regular layers, or laminae, inclining or horizontal, as the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face is acclivous or flat. Three conical hills, of about five or ſix hundred feet perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular height, ſituated in the midſt of this, particularly thoſe conſtituting what is called Morne Rouge, or the red mountain, are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely compoſed of vitrified rocks and ſtones, of a black or brown colour, and ſcoriae inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed with an earth exactly reſembling iron ruſt, reduced to powder. No trace, however, of the crater of a volcano can be perceived on any of them; but they are ſo placed, with reſpect to each other, as to form a very deep circumſcribed hollow, which once perhaps was the crater of an immenſe volcano. The ſcoriae, by the action

indigenous aliment of the country, with occaſionally the addition of the leaſt injurious of the European delicacies, live to an age uncommon even in the temperate regions of the old continent. The old monaſtic rhyme is in all countries the beſt rule of diet:

               </q>
but it is more eſpecially ſo here, where great efforts are made by Nature in the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilation of the European conſtitution to the tropic climate in the firſt inſtance; and where diſeaſes, mild among the indigenae, or the aſſimilated of the country, become fatal to the imprudent ſtranger. In fact, it is this circumſtance which has given riſe in Europe to the prevailing idea of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthfulneſs of theſe iſlands, and of Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada in particular; for the climate of Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada, notwithſtanding the variable tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, occaſioned by the irregularity of its ſurface, and the moiſture of its atmoſphere, is certainly healthy, compared to other

countries in the ſame latitude; and would prove ſo to every deſcription of its inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, were they all equally temperate, and equally careful to avoid thoſe exceſſes in diet, which in all climates are dangerous, and often fatal. To prove this, no more is neceſſary than to attend to the uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted health and great age of many of the French and Creole inhabitants of both ſexes. Eighty, ninety, and an hundred years is by no means an uncommon age among theſe; and females are in general longer lived than males. One inſtance has occurred, of life being lengthened out to the 127th year<note n="10" place="bottom">"James Forthon, Eſq. in the 127th year of his age, in Grenada. He was born at Bourdeaux in 1645, ſettled in the Weſt Indies in 1694, married at St. Chriſtopher, and removed to Martinique, where he remained thirty years, and has reſided in Grenada forty. He retained his eye-ſight till his 117th year, and his health till within a few days of his death."—<hi>Annual Regiſter,</hi> 1773, <hi>March.</hi>
               </note>: an age not very far ſhort of the famed inſtances of longevity of our own country; and, if the climates are conſidered, certainly more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary. An anecdote lately related to me of this aged perſon, is uncommonly ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular. M. Forthon lived on a coffee-ſtate in
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:035302_0046_10021817FB1D8B80"/>
that part of the pariſh of St. George, called Foret Noire, or the black foreſt, about five miles from town. The gentleman who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the anecdote to me, with another, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited this old gentleman two or three years before his death. They found him employed in having a negro-wench flogged: and as he was blind, he was led to the place where the culprit lay, in order, by feeling, to know whether the puniſhment had been properly inflicted or not. Being ſatisfied in this point, he returned with a firm ſteady ſtep to his ſeat. The cauſe of this puniſhment was ſtill more extraordinary. A Mr. Maly, Mr. Forthon's grandſon-in-law, aſſured my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant, that Forthon puniſhed the wench, who acted as a kind of houſekeeper to him, for refuſing to admit of his embraces.—The French and Creole inhabitants are never afflicted with the fatal topical inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, often epidemic among the Engliſh and negroes; nor do fevers of a bad kind ever appear among them. Their ſtrength continues as unimpaired as their conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; ſo that it is no uncommon thing to ſee a very old Frenchman walk and ride with all the firmneſs and activity of youth.
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:035302_0047_1002181A6EC334E8"/>
This does not appear to ariſe from their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence being cooler and higher than that of the Engliſh inhabitants; for many, poſſeſſing fine plantations on the coaſt, enjoy the ſame exemption from diſeaſe, experienced by the coffee-ſettlers on the mountains, although the difference of heat is as thirteen to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more than ſeventeen.</p>
            <p>Were we to exclude the effects of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſma of the marſhy diſtricts, and thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the irregular temperature of the air, we ſhould find that, in common years, there is by no means much ſickneſs; and that in general it is only in thoſe places where marſhes are abundant, as in Marquis, Seauteur, and a few detached ſpots in other parts of the coaſt, diſeaſes <hi>mali moris</hi> prevail. There indeed, one year with another, fully an eighteenth part of the inhabitants annually periſh; but in other diſtricts, where theſe dreadful cauſes of diſeaſe do not exiſt, the mortality is not more than one in 37 or 38.</p>
            <p>The endemic diſeaſes are either bilious, putrid, or inflammatory, as the ſeaſons are hot and wet, or dry and cool. Thus, in
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:035302_0048_1002181DA42FC370"/>
the ſummer and autumnal months, or that portion of the year which includes the rainy and warm ſeaſon, remittent fevers, dyſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, ſlight colics, cholera morbus, phrene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic complaints, or what the French call <hi>Coup de Soleil,</hi> occaſioned by the intenſe ſolar heat, ulcers of the legs, particularly thoſe of the herpetic kind, are the moſt prevalent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders. And in the marſhy diſtricts at this time of the year, obſtinate and irregular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termittents, generally depending on glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dular obſtruction and viſceral inflammation, remittents of the worſt kind, and hepatic dyſenteries, are very common, frequently epidemic, and too often fatal.

One very extraordinary inſtance will ſuffice to ſhow the propriety of conſidering this diſeaſe as one of the epidemics of the dry ſeaſon. On the eſtates of Edmund Thornton, Eſq. ſituated in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trict of St. George's pariſh, called Point Saline, already deſcribed, and at the fartheſt extremity of it, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes are attacked regularly every year, about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of November, with ſymptoms of the Guinea-worm. In the month of January the diſeaſe ſpreads throughout the greateſt part of the gang; and in the month of March it entirely diſappears; and they continue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from it till the following November. The cauſe of this ſingular diſeaſe on the eſtates I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, ſeems to be confined to the water of ſome wells, which have been dug in the ſubſtance, called Tuf, of which the whole gang drink; there being no ſprings or rivulets in the diſtrict, and unfortunately no ciſterns to collect and preſerve the rain water. This has been ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered evident by what has happened on ſome neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring eſtates; the negroes of which, till of late, were as ſubject to this diſtreſſing complaint as thoſe belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Mr. Thornton. The wells were filled up, ciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns built, or wells dug in places not ſubject to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the flow and ebb of the tide; and at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the uſual period of the appearance of the Guinea-worm, nothing of the kind happened. They have ever ſince (three years now) continued exempted from the diſeaſe. In the water which contains the embryos of the dracunculi, the naked eye diſtinguiſhes innumerable animalcules, darting in every direction with aſtoniſhing force and rapidity: theſe, on being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to examination in a ſmall microſcope, exhibit a very extraordinary figure, differing from any animal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules hitherto deſcribed. Till within theſe few years, this diſeaſe was conſidered as peculiar to that part of the coaſt of Guinea contained between Cape Coaſt Caſtle and Acras, about ninety miles in extent: and it was believed that the ſlaves from the Gold Coaſt were alone ſubject to it, and always brought it with them to the Weſt Indies, but never contracted it there. This how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever has been proved to be without foundation; for the Creole-negroes are as ſubject to it as the Africans. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants have it as well as the moſt aged; and no part of the body or extremities is exempted from it: the arms, legs, every part of the trunk, the ſcrotum, penis, and even the pudenda muliebria, within the labia.</note>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:035302_0049_1002181F38950410"/>
are the moſt common epidemics. At all ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, hepatic inflammation is very frequent;
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:035302_0050_10021821D76C8560"/>
and when anomalous, always epidemic. Worms alſo are common throughout the year, and frequently give riſe to very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary ſymptoms. The yellow fever (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called) ſometimes appears; but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves no particular ſeaſon. Ruptures, ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms, elephantiaſis, or the glandular diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe of Dr. Hendy, hydrocephalus, yaws, putrid or ulcerous fore throats, mortification of the fingers and toes, chronic aphthae
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:035302_0051_10021823749E5A28"/>
leproſy, and tetanus, may be ranked among the ſporadic endemics of this country, and are certainly not the leaſt tremendous of them; but fortunately they are either confined to the negro race, or rarely occur. The ſpecies of tetanus peculiar to infants, and hence called Triſmus Naſcentium, is an endemic of this iſland, and always a fatal one: it prevails only in the marſhy and moiſt parts of the iſland, and takes place any time before the ninth day after birth; after which period it has never been known to happen. It does not appear to ariſe from a retention of the meconium; for however carefully infants have been evacuated, the diſeaſe has in no inſtance been thereby prevented. From its preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in moiſt, cold, or marſhy ſituations, we may with more propriety attribute it to cold and impure air. This dreadful malady admits of no cure; but we fortunately poſſeſs a moſt certain preventive. It is with ſingular pleaſure I aſſign the diſcovery of this beneficial application to my worthy and experienced friend Dr. John Stewart, of this iſland. About five or ſix years ago, on an eſtate which this gentleman had the
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:035302_0052_100218266F5FEA18"/>
charge of, the manager frequently men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to him the unfavourable circumſtance of all the infants born on it dying of the locked jaw before the ninth day, and that this had uniformly been the event in every inſtance for many years, although every poſſible caution had been taken to prevent it. The plantation was ſituated in a valley, and conſequently damp; but in all other reſpects healthy. Obſerving that the negro midwives were not very nice in their choice of the inſtrument with which they cut the umbilical cord, he ſuſpected that the rubiginous particles might produce ſuch irritation as to cauſe the fatal diſeaſe in queſtion. Having this in view, he directed the midwives to dreſs the part with a folded piece of ſoft linen, well ſmoaked in ſpirit of turpentine, inſtead of the common way. They attended to his directions; and not a ſingle infant has died on the eſtate ſince. The practice, in ſituations wherein this diſeaſe has occurred, has become general, and has been attended with ſucceſs in every inſtance. It may not be uſeleſs to add, that ſeveral planters, both here and in Tobago, make uſe of this application to lambs, calves,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:035302_0053_1002182809893D08"/>
and colts, with equal ſucceſs. As many of theſe animals die ſoon after they are dropped in moiſt and marſhy ſituations of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the adoption of this ſimple preventive may be a general benefit to the inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants.</p>
            <p>The iſland is frequently viſited by the ſmall pox, ſometimes of the confluent or malignant kind. It has in almoſt every inſtance been introduced from the coaſt of Africa, in the ſlave-ſhips; on board of which it frequently breaks out, and commits dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ravages on the paſſage to the Weſt Indies; but as inoculation is always had recourſe to at the time, or ſoon after this diſeaſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, the mortality occaſioned by it is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom conſiderable. The chicken-pox is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon almoſt every year; and as it appears without any evident introduction, it may be conſidered as more an endemic than a foreign diſeaſe. It is always mild, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires no other treatment than a laxative at the turn, or when the puſtules dry.</p>
            <p>The meaſles and hooping cough ſeldom appear here; for in the courſe of ten years
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:035302_0054_10021829A597BFB0"/>
I recollect only two inſtances of the former, and one of the latter: they were of a very bad kind, and proved fatal to many children.</p>
            <p>No inſtance, as far as I have been able to learn, has occurred of a bite or ſting of any poiſonous reptile, ſnake, or ſerpent; and indeed of the latter there are only two kinds found, both of which are ſaid to be harmleſs. Scorpions, ſcolopendras, a large ſpecies of ſpider called Tarantula, and two or three ſpecies of waſps, are ſometimes troubleſome, and by their ſtings occaſion painful inflammations; but are never poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous. The ſting-rays very frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict very dangerous wounds; and the pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles of the ſea-eggs, often unperceived, give the unwary a ſhock as violent and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected as that of electricity. The little wounds they inflict, though not dangerous, are exceedingly troubleſome and painful. The negroes make uſe of a very ſimple me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of extracting theſe prickles; they place the patient's foot over a fire as cloſe as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, without burning, and when it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently heated, they rub it well with can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle-greaſe,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:035302_0055_1002182C022024C8"/>
and repeat the operation three or four times; they then wrap it up, and a few hours after, the prickles fall out. The pain ceaſes after the firſt application of the heat and greaſe.</p>
            <p>I have already obſerved, that Grenada ſurpaſſes almoſt all the Windward and Lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward iſlands in the abundance and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its water. I may add, that it alſo excels in its medicinal ſprings: ſome of theſe are hot, but the greateſt number are cold. Of the former the moſt noted are thoſe of Duqueſne Valley, ſituated in the pariſh of St. Patrick. The temperature of the hotteſt of theſe ſprings is 116 degrees; and from their habitudes with precipitants, compared with Bergman's Analyſis,<note n="12" place="bottom">Bergman's Chemical Eſſays, Vol. 1.</note> they appear to contain a conſiderable portion of iron, magneſia, a mineral alkali, and common ſalt. Aerated acid is not indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by lime-water, or the blue flowers of the vervein. Their ſmell is pretty much hepatiſed; from which, and their heat, it is probable they contain a ſmall portion of ſulphur in a very volatile ſtate. They
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:035302_0056_1002182ECD2036D8"/>
have been uſed frequently internally and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally, with conſiderable advantage in chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic rheumatiſms, herpetic complaints, old ulcers, ſcrophula, and leproſy; but they riſe in a country ſo extremely rugged, and unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately ſo little attention has been paid to the road or path which leads to them, that much general benefit cannot be expected from them. Of the cold medicinal ſprings, the moſt remarkable are thoſe of Montroſe and the Hermitage, in the pariſh of St. Patrick; and thoſe of Beaugency, in St. George's pariſh. The temperature of all theſe is 78 degrees; and from their habitudes with precipitants, they appear (particularly the two former) to contain a large portion of vitriolated magneſia and a mineral alkali. The Beaugency water appears to be true Selt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer, containing a much larger proportion of aerated acid than the former. Beſides theſe ſprings, there are found in a few places, particularly on the Hermitage, mephitic exhalations, of a moſt pernicious nature. The Hermitage vapour iſſues from a ſmall hole in the ſide of a riſing ground, within a few yards of the river Antoine; no water riſes with it, but in iſſuing it makes a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:035302_0057_100218305FB5B8B8"/>
hiſſing noiſe. Around the opening from whence this ſtream of mephitic air comes, a number of birds, lizards, and other ſmall animals are found dead; and experiments have been made which prove its deadly influence on dogs and fowls.</p>
            <p>The year in the Weſt Indies is divided into two portions; the one called the Dry, the other the Wet ſeaſon. Some divide each of theſe alſo into two; which they call the Long and Short winter, and the Short and Long ſummer. The latter diviſion has been made by the French; but as it is not always obſervable, it will be ſufficient barely to have mentioned it. What is generally underſtood by the expreſſion Dry Seaſon, is the portion of the year contained between the beginning of December and the end of April. The commencement and termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion however of this ſeaſon are not always obſerved to happen at thoſe periods; for the rains may continue till the beginning of January, recur frequently during the vernal months, and ſet in again at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of April; or not appear till June or July. It is fortunate however for the
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:035302_0058_10021831F568ED88"/>
planter, that theſe deviations from the uſual courſe of the ſeaſon ſeldom occur; for, when they do, their effects are often fatally experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced on the extent of the crops. The dry ſeaſon, in its ordinary courſe, is pleaſant and healthy, the ſky exhibiting a vaſt expanſe of azure, uninterrupted by clouds or any denſe medium; and the atmoſphere being pure, dry, and-temperate. It is almoſt conſtantly uſhered in by northerly, or north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſterly winds, and theſe and north-eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly winds prevail with little variation the whole of its continuance; but are moſt chilly, dry, and boiſterous in the months of December, January, and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary. If however the wind, during this ſeaſon, ſhould in the day-time blow from any other point but thoſe I have mentioned, it always towards the cloſe of evening re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to a northerly point. Thus it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happens in extraordinary years, that from 6 A. M. to 7 or 8 P. M. the wind is from a point between S. and E. or S. and W. but, at the latter hour, it ſuddenly veers round to the northward, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues ſo till the following morning, when it again changes to the ſouthward. The
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:035302_0059_10021833960C9F70"/>
total ſuſpenſion of vegetation during this ſeaſon is ſurpriſing, and ſeems to be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the want of moiſture, and the exſiccative ſhrivelling quality of the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly winds. That it is to be attributed chiefly to the latter is evident, from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efficacy of the rain which ſometimes falls very plentifully in the dry months, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing a ſpring in vegetables: when how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are longer continued than uſual, their vegetative power faintly diſcovers it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but is never permanent. All deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous trees are ſtriped of their leaves; the paſtures become parched and brown; the cane-fields loſe their vivid green, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the autumnal hue of northern climes. The latter months of this ſeaſon are the moſt pleaſant of the year; Nature beginning to recover from the torpor in which ſhe had been ſunk, gives new life to the whole vegetable creation; and ſo great is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getative power diſplayed at this period, that leaves and bloſſoms are ſeen ſhooting forth on the ſame tree, with fruits already formed, and faſt approaching to maturity. Nothing can equal the delightful freſhneſs of the mornings, and the ſoftneſs of the evenings
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:035302_0060_10021836DEF9A448"/>
of April and May, in this ſeaſon. The at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere is dry, cool, and ſaturated with the perfume of a thouſand bloſſoms; ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure is univerſal, and tempered with the ſofteſt tints of ſpring; the winds are gentle and ſoft, and never charged with the ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try heats of July.</p>
            <p>The rainy ſeaſon includes the ſummer, autumn, and generally the firſt month of winter; its approach is awful, and always indicated by thick fog reſting on the tops of the higher mountains; this is ſoon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by heavy, black, watery clouds, ſlowly rolling along from the north-eaſt, in terrific volumes, enveloping the mountains, and darting bright electric coruſcations from their edges. Theſe clouds, ſometimes burſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the mountainous tracts, are ſuddenly converted into torrents of water, which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, inundating the country below, commit conſiderable devaſtation in their progreſs; a body of water, not unfrequently ſix feet high, rolling down the beds of the rivulets, carries every thing before it, and diſcolours the ſea ſeveral miles in every di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from their mouths, with the ochry
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:035302_0061_100218390DC4CF90"/>
earth of the interior country. But although this portion of the year is called the rainy ſeaſon, to diſtinguiſh it from that juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, we are not to imagine that it is compoſed of a continued ſeries of rainy weather, comfortleſs, gloomy, and never brightened by the cheerful-rays of the ſun. Many ſucceſſive days occur of dry weather; and it ſometimes happens, that the length of time without rain endangers the ſucceſs of the planters exertions. Theſe dry tracts chiefly occur in Auguſt and September, and are almoſt unſupportably ſultry and cloſe. The rains fall in aſtoniſhing quantities;—but as I unfortunately poſſeſſed no means of meaſuring it, I cannot with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion ſay what the average quantity is: no idea however can be formed of it from what falls in Europe. During the rainy ſeaſon, ſoutherly, eaſterly, and weſterly winds prevail, and are always hot and ſultry.</p>
            <p>The months of March and September, when the equinoxes happen, are particularly ſtormy; the winds are uncommonly boiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous, but generally unaccompanied with
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:035302_0062_1002183B6AE5E730"/>
rain. Guſts ſuch as are every autumn and ſpring experienced in the continent of North America, are never known to happen here; and hurricanes, which often lay waſte the ſiſter colonies to the northward, ſeldom occur in Grenada; or if they do, they are little more violent than common gales of wind. The dreadful hurricane of the year 1780, which proved ſo deſtructive in Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica, Barbadoes, Antigua, Dominica, St. Vincent, and the French iſlands, did no other damage here than throwing down ſome trees, and a few old buildings. A few neutral veſſels indeed were driven aſhore in the carenage; but it was an event to be attributed entirely to the negligence of their captains.</p>
            <p>The regular ſucceſſion of ſea and land-breezes, ſo conſtantly obſerved in the larger iſlands, and on the continent, never occurs here: but there are two periods in the twenty-four hours, during which there is a perfect calm, and conſequently a very diſagreeable oppreſſive heat, from eight till ten in the morning, and from two till four in the afternoon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="unknown:035302_0063_1002183DB5F01B00"/>
That northerly and eaſterly winds are the moſt prevalent, is demonſtrated by the manner in which all the trees on the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern ſide of the mountains are bent: they are all, particularly thoſe growing on the moſt expoſed ſituations, ſtinted and dwarf; and their branches are inclined to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt. Next to theſe is the ſoutherly; and the leaſt frequent is the weſterly.</p>
            <p>Lightning, and its conſequence thunder, are phenomena not ſo frequent in Grena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da as the ſituation of the iſland and its high conical mountains might induce us to expect; nor are the flaſhes and the explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſo tremendous, by any means, as they are in the ſouthern ſtates of North America. It ſeldom happens that lightning is the cauſe of much miſchief here; for in the courſe of twelve years, I know of only two inſtances of its miſchievous effects. In the dry ſeaſon they never occur: they are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally preceded by whitiſh clouds hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the ſides and tops of the mountains, in the form of huge bales; and fleecy clouds diſperſed in various forms throughout the ſky. Southerly winds accompany them ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally.</p>

The thermometer I uſed is a mercurial one, graduated by Fahrenheit's ſcale, and mode by Fraſer, London. The hall in which it hung is reckoned one of the cooleſt rooms in St. George's, ſituated on the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of the part of the town called The Hill: it was almoſt conſtantly expoſed to a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of air, which paſſed between the door and one of the windward windows; and the height of the mercury in the tube was almoſt always taken at 7 A. M. at 1 P. M. and at 10 P. M. The choice of theſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods in the twenty-four hours, aroſe from my obſervation of the following fact: At 7 A. M. the heat begins to increaſe, and continues to do ſo till 1 P. M.; from which time till 4 P. M. it is ſtationary; it then begins to diminiſh, and continues to do ſo till about 10 P. M.; from which till 7 A. M. it is again ſtationary. This routine of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature is diſturbed only when any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable change takes place in the atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere, ſuch as much rain, attended with ſtrong wind; and during ſome part of the dry ſeaſon, when, as I have already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, ſouth-eaſterly winds are ſucceeded at night by northerly ones. Thus, from
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:035302_0065_10021841903BF5C8"/>
the latter cauſe, the thermometer ſinks in the courſe of the night two, three, or four degrees; ſo that when it is 80 at 10 P.M. it will be only 76, 77, or 78, at 7 of the following morning, in January, February, and March. A fall of rain, accompanied with wind, has a very remarkable effect on the thermometer. The greateſt change I ever obſerved was ten degrees; the leaſt, four; ſo that the medium may be about ſeven degrees. Theſe changes are moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in the ſummer and autumnal months, when the rains fall in greateſt abundance: and when there is often an alternate ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of rain with cold, and dry weather with heat. It may not be unneceſſary to obſerve, however, that during rain, ſhould the atmoſphere remain ſtill, the thermome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter continues at the ſame height as before it began to rain. I have repeatedly obſerved this, even when the quantity of rain has been very conſiderable; and it is a pheno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon which ſhould not ſurpriſe us, ſince we know the great ſhare which winds, or currents of air, have in evaporation, and this in the production of cold.<note n="13" place="bottom">See Eſſays and Obſervations, Phyſical and Literary, Vol. II. p. 159.</note>

When I have expoſed the thermometer to the direct rays of the ſun, in an incloſed yard, where the wind could have little effect upon it, the mercury has riſen in ten minutes to 130 degrees, or 42 degrees above its ſtationary point at noon, in the hall where the inſtrument was before ſuſpénded; but as the reflection from the walls of the yard might conſiderably increaſe the heat, I did not conſider this as a fair trial of the natural heat of the ſun. I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore frequently, on clear days, ſuſpended the thermometer in a gallery, directly expoſed to the ſun's rays, and found that the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury roſe to 113 degrees, and once to 120 degrees at noon, or generally about 30 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees above the uſual height in the ſhade at noon.</p>
            <p>Another thing to be obſerved, is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the heat of the air at the hotteſt time of the day, and during the night; or the periods during which the thermometer is generally ſtationary. The medium of the heat in the ſhade at noon, or 1 P. M. is about 83, 30; at night 74; ſo that in general the difference is about
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:035302_0067_10021845816F10C0"/>
9 degrees. I have not found that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of heat in the ground, and firſt floors of my houſe, differed much from that in the upper, which was covered with a tiled roof: and conſequently the air contained in it we would expect ſhould be more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the heat of the ſun than the lower floors. In general, this difference has never exceeded 1 degree.</p>
            <p>I may here take notice of the difference of temperature produced in water, by the heat of the atmoſphere, during the day and night. It ſhews how extremely ſenſible the human body is to the ſmalleſt deviation, from the uſual heat it is expoſed to; and that our ſenſe of cold, in this climate, is merely relative. At 10 P. M. into a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh unglazed earthen guglet (of that kind generally uſed here for cooling water) full of water, I plunged a ſmall thermometer: in five minutes the mercury ſunk 3 degrees, its ſtationary point then, in the open air, being 82 degrees. I then placed the guglet in an open window, where it was left till 6 A. M. On plunging the thermometer into the water, the mercury ſunk to 72 degrees, or 10 degrees lower than its ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:035302_0068_1002184896210618"/>
point during the night. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of coolneſs in the water was, to my taſte, rather cold and chilling. At 1 P. M. I plunged the thermometer into a guglet of water which had been ſtanding in the ſhade all the forenoon, when the mercury fell to 82 degrees, or 2 degrees lower than the heat of the room at that time. It is to be obſerved, that the guglets uſed here, for the purpoſe of cooling water, are brought from South America, are porous, and of courſe a conſiderable evaporation takes place from all their external ſurface.</p>
            <p>It is not at all ſurpriſing that this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſhould be ſubject to earthquakes. The conical hills and mountains into which the ſurface of the iſland is divided; the lakes<note n="14" place="bottom">One of theſe, called the Grand Etang, or Great Lake, to diſtinguiſh it from another on the windward ſide of the iſland, is ſituated in a circular baſon, cut out of the ſummit of the higheſt mountain of the iſland. It is about a mile in circumference; and its depth is, in general, about 14 feet. The other, called the Lake of the River Antoine, retains the appearance of an extinguiſhed volcano, much more perfectly than the Grand Etang. The hollow which contains it is perfectly circular, and gradually ſlopes from the brim to the edge of the water, which is of very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable depth.</note>
               <pb n="54" facs="unknown:035302_0069_1002184A2AB578C0"/>
contained in what have every appearance of having been once the craters of immenſe volcanos; the regular horizontal ſtrata of the ſubſtance called Tuf, which ſeems ſtill to retain many of the diſtinguiſhing marks of lava; theſe and ſeveral other peculiarities to be obſerved in the ſtructure of this as well as moſt of the windward iſlands, give us room to believe that volcanos did once exiſt in them; and we know that where volcanos are, or have been, earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes are very frequent. In the courſe of the three firſt years of my reſidence in Grenada, there were five earthquakes. The firſt and moſt violent happened on the 22d of December, 1784, about 2 P. M. In St. George's it continued about a minute and a half, and ran from about N. N. W. to S. S. E. It ſhook the earth in a violent manner, and when ſtrongeſt, occaſioned an undulating motion of the ſurface. It was attended with a hollow rumbling noiſe, like diſtant thunder. The atmoſphere was ſtill and cloſe while it laſted; the thermometer 82. The ſea did not appear to be in the leaſt agitated. The marſhes at Calivini were much agitated by it; <gap reason="illegible: torn page" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> of their
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:035302_0070_1002184C91029570"/>
ſurface was perceived to be very great, and to continue ſome time after the ſhock ceaſed. On the windward ſide of the iſland, the ſhock continued about two minutes; and was much more violent than in town. The captain of a ſhip, at that time off the coaſt of the iſland, ſaid, the ſenſation which the ſhock occaſioned on board, was ſimilar to that of the ſhip's bottom rubbing againſt rocks; but that the ſea was not agitated. The ſame was obſerved by ſome gentlemen going to Cariacou. On the 24th of April, 1785, about 40 minutes paſt ſix A. M. a ſhock of an earthquake was felt, which laſted only about two ſeconds; but about 20 ſeconds after, a ſecond was felt, which continued a little longer. It was very gentle, was not general, and appeared to run from N. N. W. to S. S. E. The morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was calm. On the 26th of May, about midnight, a ſhock was generally felt, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from about W. to E.; it continued about 30 ſeconds, and ſhook the houſes very conſiderably. On the 29th of the ſame month, about 10 P. M. another ſhock was generally felt, and continued about 20 ſeconds. And on the 16th of January,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:035302_0071_1002184E298F8AA8"/>
1786, in the morning, three ſhocks were perceived running from N. N. W. to S. S. E. the two firſt were very ſlight; but the third was violent. During the ſeven laſt years, not a ſingle ſhock has occurred: an extraordinary circumſtance, conſidering their frequency in the preceding years. In thoſe iſlands, however, on which the volcanic appearances are more perfect than they are here, ſuch as St. Vincent, St. Lucia, and Dominica, earthquakes are much more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and violent.</p>
            <p>Water-ſpouts are very rarely ſeen around Grenada; for during the laſt ten years, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect only two.</p>
            <p>The barometer does not appear to be affected much in this climate. A moiſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere, with ſoutherly and weſterly winds, makes the mercury to ſink a little; and northerly winds, with a dry cold at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere, make it riſe. But notwithſtanding the irregularity of temperature, and the moiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which (prevails more or leſs throughout the whole year here) of the atmoſphere, the greateſt range of the barometer during
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:035302_0072_100218515444DBA8"/>
any year, has not exceeded one inch and five-tenths. This is, however, conſiderably greater than that which happens at Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badoes, where the greateſt range is not more than half an inch. In uncommon years, when a long continuance of northerly winds produces a degree of cold in the atmoſphere extremely diſagreeable to our feelings, the barometer has ſtood for a month together at 30 degrees. In the months of July and Auguſt, when much rain falls, it has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued at 28: 5 ſeveral days ſucceſſively; and the atmoſphere then is inſufferably cloſe.</p>
            <p>I have already mentioned, that it was not in my power to determine the quantity of rain, owing to my not being poſſeſſed of the proper inſtruments; but with a view to remedy this defect, I have, following the example of the late Dr. Cleghorn in his account of the weather at Minorca, marked the rainy days, and the proportion they bore to each other, by dots. Thus, drizzling rain is denoted by., ſhowery by.., heavy rain by..., and exceſſive rain by....</p>

            <head>AN ESSAY, ON THE MALIGNANT PESTILENTIAL FEVER, &amp;c. &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE ſtate of the atmoſphere between the tropics, does not ſeem to admit of the generation of a high degree of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion; and wherever ſuch exiſts, it muſt ariſe from the moſt unpardonable neglect of cleanlineſs, and the retention of contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous effluvia from a total want of ventila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The heat and conſequent rarefaction of the air in hot climates, where due atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is paid to cleanlineſs and ventilation, muſt prevent infection; and it is probable, that it is only where there is not a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient number of people to render, by their exertions, the places they inhabit, clean and ſweet, that infection takes place and is retained. The obſervation made by Dr.

Blane on this ſubject, is, in many reſpects, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and may be confirmed by that of every intelligent practitioner in this country. He ſays, "there is reaſon to think that the open air very ſoon diſſipates, and renders inert all infections of the volatile kind; and of courſe, the warmer the air is, the more readily it will have this effect. It is accordingly obſerved, that infection is much leſs apt to be generated about the perſons of men, and that it adheres to them for a much leſs ſpace of time in a hot climate than in a cold or temperate one."<note n="1" place="bottom">Obſervations on the Diſeaſes of Seamen, p. 277.</note> If in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, or rather the contagion ariſing from accumulated human effluvia, is produced only in ſituations wherein many are crowded together in a comparatively ſmall ſpace, it becomes a queſtion of no ſmall importance, why malignant and infectious fevers are never, or very ſeldom, generated on board ſlave-ſhips. In theſe the number is much greater than tranſports, or ſhips hired for the purpoſe of emigration, ever contain: the ſlaves, in order to prevent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, are generally kept below, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:035302_0096_1002189020A2F718"/>
in irons, particularly during the night: the ſmell between decks is intolerably offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to thoſe not accuſtomed to it. Infection, however, is prevented, where ſo many cauſes combine to produce it, by the following means: The crew of a ſlave-ſhip is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally very numerous; whereby the riſk, ſhould inſurrection happen, is much leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened, and the attention to the ſlaves is proportionally increaſed: the ſpace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween decks is regularly waſhed every day, if the weather permits: the ſlaves are, in parties of thirty or forty, taken on deck in fine weather, their irons taken off, and they are encouraged, by every poſſible means, to exerciſe themſelves by dancing: they have no cloathing to which infectious particles can adhere: their perſons are frequently waſhed: their diet is always compoſed of vegetables, without any mixture of animal food, and ſeaſoned highly with capſicum: their drink is water: and ſcuttles are cut in the ſides of the ſhip, by means of which, and windſails when they can be uſed, there is kept up a conſtant change of air, and as free a ventilation as the ſituation can admit of. But in every ſituation wherein the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:035302_0097_10021892D3019DA8"/>
of infection is poſſible, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of it is proportional to the degree of intereſt of thoſe who have the direction and command. In ſhips of war, in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant ſhips, in tranſports, and in ſhips hired for emigration, the intereſt of thoſe who command extends not beyond the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſenſe of duty; of courſe we find it generally weak: it is rare, indeed, to meet an inſtance of the contrary; but where we do, the effect is conſpicuous. In ſlave-ſhips, the profits of the captain and ſurgeon are more or leſs, according to the number brought to market and actually ſold; hence their intereſt in their welfare is great, and their exertions to maintain it are proportional. It is diſgraceful that 
  
  <q>quaerenda pecunia primum, virtus poſt nummos,</q>
  
ſhould be in all ages the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing maxim of mankind.</p>
            <p>In ſhips therefore in which the captains are not urged to prevent infection by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of intereſt, fevers of a malignant and peſtilential nature may be generated, even in hot climates. A ſhip of this deſcription in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced the very fatal fever which raged
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:035302_0098_1001F762B65944E0"/>
in the port and town of St. George, during ſeveral months of the year 1793. The circumſtances of this ſhip are in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects ſingular. The following account I was favoured with by a gentleman,<note n="2" place="bottom">Mr. J. Paiba.</note> who was one of the adventurers in the Boullam Scheme, and who, deſpairing of ſucceſs, left the coaſt of Africa in this ſhip.</p>
            <p>The Hankey ſailed from England, in company with another ſhip, both chartered by the Sierra Leona company, loaded with ſtores and adventurers for the projected co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony at Boullam, about the beginning of the month of April, 1792. When theſe ſhips ſailed, and during the voyage out, the crews and ſettlers were all healthy; and as the latter were in general of the middling claſs of people, and appeared to be induced to ſettle in this new country, more from the deluſive proſpect of wealth held out to them, and the fanatic enthuſiaſm for the Abolition of the Slave Trade of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than by any deprivation of the means of ſubſiſtence in their own country, no ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:035302_0099_10021897D82FD178"/>
whatever can be entertained of the exiſtence of latent infection among them; nor can marſh effluvia be ſuppoſed as the origin of the diſeaſe which afterwards ſwept off ſo many of thoſe unhappy people. Boul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam being ſurrounded by the ſea, enjoys all the advantages of the ſea-breeze; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dry, and not incommoded by any marſhy tracts, it is conſidered as the healthieſt ſpot on the windward coaſt.<note n="3" place="bottom">This part of Africa is allowed, by all who have viſited it, to be uncommonly healthy and pleaſant. I have converſed with ſeveral intelligent captains of ſlave-ſhips, who have uniformly agreed in this point: and indeed the appearance of the ſlaves brought from the windward coaſt, part of which this is, conſtitutes a convincing proof of the ſalubrity of the climate. Many travellers have given their teſtimony to this effect: the Chevalier de Marchais, in particular, is very full of its praiſe: "Le lit de cette riviere (Sierra Leona) renferme quantité d'iſles d'un terrein par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faitement bon, gras et profond qui produit de lui-meme et preſque ſans culture tout ce-qui eſt neceſſaire á la vie—Mais ce qu'on ne ſçauroit eſtimer aſſez, c'eſt que l'air y eſt très pur, et qu'on n'y eſt point ſujet à ces maladies violentes et dangereuſes qui regnent à la Coté de Guinée et qui ont fait perir tant d'Européens.

It is, however, deſtitute of freſh water; and that, procured by digging tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary wells on the beech, is brackiſh, and conſequently unwholeſome. The negroes of this part of Africa are ferocious in an extraordinary degree; and are even ſaid to be cannibals. This circumſtance prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the erection of any ſort of accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation on ſhore, during the nine months the Hankey lay there, the ſettlers were obliged to live on board; and the rainy ſeaſon coming on almoſt immediately after their arrival, and the heat being at the ſame time exceſſively great, they endeavoured to ſhelter themſelves from both, by raiſing the ſides of the ſhip ſeveral feet, and covering her with a wooden roof.</p>

Among upwards of two hundred people, of whom women and children conſtituted a part, thus confined in a ſultry, moiſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere, cleanlineſs could not be well at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, however well-inclined the people themſelves might be. Theſe circumſtances, joined to the depreſſion of mind conſequent upon their diſappointment, muſt certainly be conſidered as the cauſes of the malignant fever which broke out among thoſe unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate people, ſome time after their arrival at Boullam. And no doubt can be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that neglecting to ſweeten the ſhip, to ventilate her afterwards, and to deſtroy the clothes, bedding, &amp;c. of thoſe who died on board, was the ſole cauſe of her retaining the ſeeds of infection when ſhe arrived at this port. The following facts will ſerve to illuſtrate this: Capt. Coxe, finding the water at Boullam unwholeſome, proceeded with his ſhip to Biſſao, where there is a Portugueſe ſettlement, for a ſupply. The ſhip was navigated by about twelve ſeamen, moſt of whom had not experienced ſickneſs, and had been probably procured from Sierra Leone: at any rate they were then taken on board for the firſt time. Of theſe,
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:035302_0102_1002189D354E5108"/>
before the return of the Hankey to Boullam, nine died; and the remainder, with the captain, were reduced to a deplorable ſtate. The time for which the Hankey was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered being expired, Mr. Paiba, with his family, intended to return to England in her; but as no ſeamen could be procured, they were obliged to proceed to ſea, having on board the captain ſick, and only the mate, Mr. Paiba, and two ſeamen to navigate the ſhip. With much difficulty they arrived at St. Jago, where they fortunately found the Charon and Scorpion ſhips of war. Capt. Dodd, of the former, humanely rendered them every ſervice in his power; and on leaving them, put two men of each ſhip on board the Hankey. With this aid they proceeded to the Weſt-Indies; a voyage to England being impracticable in their wretched ſtate. On the third day after leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing St. Jago, the men they procured from the ſhips of war were ſeized with the fever, which had carried off three-fourths of thoſe on board the Hankey at Boullam; and having no aſſiſtance, two of the four died: the remaining two were put on ſhore here in the moſt wretched ſtate poſſible.
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:035302_0103_100218A040569410"/>
Capt. Dodd, on his arrival at Barbadoes from the coaſt of Africa, was ordered by Admiral Gardener to convoy the homeward-bound fleet of merchantmen. In the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of his orders, he came to Grenada on the 27th of May, and hearing of the miſchief which the Hankey had been the cauſe of, mentioned that ſeveral of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron's and Scorpion's people were ſent on board the Hankey at St. Jago, to repair her rigging, &amp;c. that from this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and the communication which his barge's crew had with that ſhip, the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence was brought on board both ſhips; and that of the Charon's crew thirty died; and of the Scorpion's about fifteen. The Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key arrived at the Port of St. George on the 19th of February, in the moſt diſtreſſed ſituation; and for a few days lay in the Bay, but was afterwards brought into the Carenage.<note n="4" place="bottom">Our Lieut. Governor, Ninian Home, Eſq. ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time after the diſeaſe became epidemic, informed me, that in conſequence of the information he had received of the clothes, &amp;c. of the victims of the ſever at Boul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam being ſtill on board the Hankey, he ordered Capt. Coxe to be brought before him and ſome gentlemen of the council, &amp;c. He then acknowledged that all the effects of thoſe who had died were then on board his ſhip; and ſaid, that he would not deſtroy them, unleſs he was indemnified for the loſs he might ſuſtain, ſhould the heirs of the deceaſed call on him for thoſe effects. Every argument was uſed to induce him to deſtroy the articles, but the only one which influences a man of this deſcription, Indemnification; and be of courſe carried the ſeminium of the diſeaſe to England when the Hankey ſailed with a convoy in July. Mr. Hume was ſo impreſſed with the idea of the danger which Capt. Coxe's conduct might be productive of on the arrival of the ſhip in England, that he wrote to the Secretary of State, ſtating the danger. Proper notice of this repreſentation was taken by Government; for the Hankey, I underſtand, was obliged to perform quarantine.</note>

            <p>The manner in which this diſeaſe was firſt communicated, and its ſubſequent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, too clearly evinced its malignant and peſtilential nature. A Capt. Remington, an intimate acquaintance of Capt. Coxe's,
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:035302_0105_100218A368325050"/>
was the firſt perſon who viſited the Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key, after her arrival in St. George's Bay. This perſon went on board of her in the evening after ſhe anchored, and remained three days; at the end of which time he left St. George's, and proceeded in a Drogher<note n="5" place="bottom">A coaſting veſſel.</note> to Grenville Bay, where his ſhip, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, lay. He was ſeized with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant peſtilential fever on the paſſage; and the violence of the ſymptoms increaſed ſo rapidly, as, on the third day, to put an end to his exiſtence. The crew of the Defiance of Blythe port, near Newcaſtle, were the next who ſuffered by viſiting this ſhip: the mate, boatſwain, and four ſailors went on board the day after her arrival: the mate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained either on deck or in the cabin, but the reſt went below, and ſtaid all night there. All of them were immediately ſeized with the fever, and died in three days. The mate was alſo taken ill, but, probably from his having been leſs expoſed to the virulence of the infection, he recovered. The crew of the ſhip Baillies, from the ſame impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent civility or curioſity, were the next
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:035302_0106_100218A59C405490"/>
who ſuffered. Theſe communicated the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the ſhips neareſt them; and it gradually ſpread from thoſe neareſt the mouth of the Carenage, where the Hankey for ſome time lay, to thoſe at the bottom of it; not one eſcaping, in ſucceſſion, whatever means the captains took to prevent it; even the ſmell and ſmoke of coal-tar, which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commonly pungent and penetrating, had no effect as a preventive; for the Hope of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, then careening, and having her bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom paid with this bitumen, received the infection as extenſively as the others, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though none of her crew died of it. In the ſhort ſpace of time from the beginning of March to the end of May, 200 of about 500 ſailors, who manned the ſhips in the regular trade, died of this fever. If to theſe we add, thoſe who ſuffered on board Guinea-ſhips, and other tranſient veſſels, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber cannot fall ſhort of 250; which is nearly one in three, or a third of all the ſailors du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring about ten weeks in harbour. From the beginning of June till the middle of Auguſt, when the diſeaſe had nearly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared, the number of ſailors was conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably diminiſhed, by two fleets having
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:035302_0107_100218A894A556E0"/>
ſailed for Europe, but the mortality was proportionably great. Although ſo great a mortality naturally leads us to form a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful idea of the virulence of the contagion which gave riſe to it, it muſt not remain unconſidered, that the prediſpoſition of the claſs of men among whom it happened, was very great. The ſailors were men from the age of fifteen to fifty; and the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which appeared to prediſpoſe them more ſtrongly than other men to the action of the contagion, were violent exerciſe in the ſun; the immoderate uſe of undiluted new rum; bathing in a ſtate of intoxication, and often when violently heated; ſleeping on deck during the night. Other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which did not depend ſo much on their own prudence, no doubt, contributed very much to give the diſeaſe ſo very fatal a tendency: the damp heat between decks; the exceſſive filth of moſt of the ſhips; and the uncleanly ſtate of the perſons and clothes of the men themſelves.</p>
            <p>About the middle of April the diſeaſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to appear on ſhore. The firſt houſe it ſhewed itſelf in, was that of Meſſrs. Stowe-wood

and Co. ſituated cloſe to the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> and the infection was evidently introduced by a negro-wench, who took in ſailors clothes to waſh. The whole of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily were ſucceſſively afflicted with it; and by them communicated to all thoſe with whom they had any intercourſe. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of temperature, and free circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of air; the temperament of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, in general, leſs diſpoſing them to be acted on by the contagion; the ſuperior care and attention to cleanlineſs, rendered the fever infinitely milder when it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared among the inhabitants. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, however, in which it ſpread in town, clearly evinced its contagious nature; for all who from friendſhip, buſineſs, or duty, communicated with the diſeaſed, were them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves infected: and no inſtance occurred wherein the contagion could not be traced to its particular ſource. A few, who more ſedulouſly avoided the houſes where the infected actually were, eſcaped: but all the means which come under the general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of Prophylactics, were, as may be readily conceived, totally inefficacious. Of theſe, the celebrated "Vinaigre de quatre
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:035302_0109_100218ABD41553B0"/>
Voleurs," or the Acetum Aromaticum of the Ed. Ph. was generally uſed, and always without ſucceſs. Camphor, ſewed into a ſmall linen bag, and hung round the neck, was another of this tribe; but equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual. It will not appear extraordinary, that the lower claſſes of men, and thoſe more eſpecially of looſe and debauched man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſhould be the moſt ſubject to this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; their greater expoſition to the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of infection, which their buſineſs as tradeſmen rendered neceſſary, contributed alſo not a little. But the deſcription of men by far the moſt obnoxious to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion, and who ſuffered moſt from it, were thoſe lately arrived from Europe; and of them, thoſe who had never before been in a hot climate. In general, thoſe poſſeſſed of tenſe fibres and ſanguineous tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were the moſt readily infected; and among whom the diſeaſe was moſt fatal. It is impoſſible to aſcertain with preciſion the number of the infected among the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and the proportion of the deaths to that, or to the general number of white males and females in St. George's; but where certainty is not, conjecture, on good grounds,
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:035302_0110_100218AEB26E7620"/>
may be admitted. We may therefore ſay, that the proportion which the deaths bore to the ſick, might have been about one to five; and the ſick to the total number of white inhabitants, about one to about one and a half.</p>
            <p>That part of the garriſon quartered neareſt to where the Hankey lay, were the firſt of this claſs of men who received the infection. A barrack, containing nearly one-half of the 45th regiment, was ſituated exactly to leeward of the Hankey, and diſtant from her about two hundred yards. It is not to be ſuppoſed, that this circumſtance alone could be productive of a diſeaſe ariſing from contagion; but it was ſo in a ſecondary manner, by exciting the curioſity of ſome of the officers. One of theſe viſited the Hankey, and, with two or three ſoldiers who rowed his boat, remained on board ſome time. The conſequence of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence was fatal to himſelf almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after; and, in a little time, to many of the men: all the officers and men were ſucceſſively ſeized with the diſeaſe; but it proved fatal only to recruits who had
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:035302_0111_100218B0E676B1E8"/>
lately joined. The ſtrength of the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at this time was 280, and of theſe 24 died; ſo that the proportion was one to ſomething leſs than twelve. The ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this proportion aroſe from the mode of treatment; as will be ſhewn hereafter.</p>
            <p>About the beginning of May, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe made its appearance in the detachment of Royal Artillery: a circumſtance rather extraordinary, as that corps were quartered in a ſituation far removed from the focus of infection. It was evidently produced, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, by the communication which the gunners, doing duty in Fort George, had with the 45th regiment; and the prediſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the men to receive infection as far as that could be induced by exceſſes in drinking, and other irregularities, was by no means leſs than that of the ſailors and ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of the 45th regiment. Of 84 people belonging to the ordnance department at that time, about 56 were ſeized with the diſeaſe before the firſt of July, and of theſe five died: a trifling mortality, conſidering the nature of the complaint. All theſe men, however, had been about three years
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:035302_0112_100218B27AC7ED88"/>
in the country, and conſequently ſuffered leſs from the diſeaſe, than about 27 re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits who joined the artillery in July. Of 26 of theſe unfortunate men who were infected, 21 died before the middle of Auguſt: a dreadful inſtance of its peculiar tendency to prove fatal to ſtrangers to the climate.</p>
            <p>About the firſt of June, the diſeaſe began to appear among the negroes of the eſtates in the neighbourhood of town; and the alarm this occaſioned was in proportion to the intereſt of thoſe concerned in the ſafety and welfare of the ſlaves; but our apprehenſions were ſoon found groundleſs; for the diſeaſe did not ſpread much among them, nor was it marked with the fatality which attended it when it appeared among the whites. In the courſe of a month its progreſs was ſo trifling, that only about one in four was ſeized with it; and the proportion of its mortality was ſtill more trifling, <abbr>viz.</abbr> one to 83. It is more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that had not this diſeaſe been ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added to the cacochymic complaint, called in this country Mal d'Eſtomac, in the two
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:035302_0113_100218B41728A660"/>
caſes which terminated fatally, there would have been no mortality at all occaſioned by it.</p>
            <p>About the middle of June, the diſeaſe broke out in the 67th regiment; and among the artificers and labourers on Richmond-hill. The infection was communicated by ſome of the latter, who had viſited their friends in town labouring under it. All were ſucceſſively ſeized with it; but it fell heavier on the officers than the men, ſeveral of the former being young men lately ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from Europe. The proportion of deaths was about one to fifteen.</p>
            <p>The diſeaſe in the courſe of the months of May, June, and July, appeared in ſeveral diſtinct and diſtant parts of the country, whither the infection was carried by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who had imprudently viſited infected houſes in town.</p>
            <p>But the infection was not confined to Grenada alone; from this, as a focus, it ſpread to the other iſlands, to Jamaica, St. Domingo, and Philadelphia, by means of
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:035302_0114_100218B653C1A5D0"/>
veſſels on board of which the infection was retained by the clothes, more eſpecially the woollen jackets of the deceaſed ſailors.</p>
            <p>I have been thus particular in ſtating the progreſs of this malignant peſtilential fever, chiefly with a view to demonſtrate, 1ſt, That it was uncommonly infectious. 2d, That it aroſe from human contagion, heightened by various cauſes to a peſtilential degree of violence. And 3d, That, like the plague, it has been communicated, in every inſtance, either by actual contact with an infected perſon; or, by breathing air charged with effluvia perſpired or diſcharged from the lungs of an infected perſon; or by touching the clothes of or ſleeping in a place where an infected perſon had been.</p>
            <p>It is curious, and may be uſeful, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the gradation of this fatal malady, with reſpect to the various deſcriptions of people expoſed to its infection. Neither age nor ſex were exempted from its attack; but ſome were more obnoxious to it than others; and the colour had evidently much influence in determining its violence. The ſcale of
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:035302_0115_100218B94ECF0BD0"/>
its violence, or the gradation it obſerved with reſpect to the different claſſes of the inhabitants, appeared to be the following:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sailors, more eſpecially the robuſt and young; thoſe leaſt accuſtomed to the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; and thoſe moſt given to drinking new rum.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Soldiers, more eſpecially recruits lately from Europe; and the moſt intemperate.</p>
            <p n="3">3. White males in general lately arrived; more eſpecially young men from Europe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. All other white males, more eſpecially the lower claſſes; and of them the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate; thoſe debilitated by recent ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p n="5">5. White females, more eſpecially thoſe connected with the ſhipping; and thoſe lately from Europe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. People of colour, from Muſtees to Cabres.</p>

            <p n="9">9. Children, more eſpecially thoſe of colour.</p>

It had been urged by ſome, that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe aroſe from the ſtate of the atmoſphere; and that human contagion could not give riſe to it, as it was ſo prevalent in diſtant and diſtinct places at the ſame time. That this opinion was without foundation, muſt evidently appear from the foregoing narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: but had there been no other proofs of its contagious nature, the ſtate of the weather alone during the months of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary, March, April, May, June, July, and Auguſt, will be ſufficient to ſhew that the temperature of the air could not produce an epidemic of ſo uncommon a character. The weather, though previous to the appearance of this diſeaſe much more wet and boiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous than is uſual at that ſeaſon of the year, was, after it broke out, mild; and would rather have tended to check than promote infection, if that had been of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be affected by ſuch an agent. The two firſt months of the year were almoſt conſtantly rainy. The latter part of March, all April, and the firſt fifteen days of May, were dry, with the wind generally at eaſt. The thermometer never roſe higher than 87, nor fell lower than 85. Almoſt all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:035302_0119_100218C0EF1E2A10"/>
of May was rainy, with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thunder and lightning. In June the quantity of rain was much greater. As the change to moiſture was remarkably ſudden and great, much expectation was formed that the virulence of the infection would be done away, or conſiderably abated; but as neither happened, the ſtrongeſt poſſible argument was afforded againſt the agency of the weather in the production of the diſeaſe. In June the thermometer, more than once, fell to 77 at noon; and roſe once as high as 88. All July was rainy alſo, with boiſterous wind from N. E. and much thunder and lightning; thermometer higheſt 88, loweſt 77. In Auguſt leſs rain fell; but the atmoſphere was generally cloſe and ſultry; wind variable, but chiefly S. and W. Thermometer higheſt 89, loweſt 80.</p>
            <p>The ſubjects of this diſeaſe may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into three claſſes; but differing from each other only in the degree of violence of the ſymptoms; and from the ſcale or gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation already given, it will readily appear that the three firſt deſcriptions of men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:035302_0120_100218C286FCF0C0"/>
the firſt claſs; the 4th and 5th the ſecond; and the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th the third. To avoid repetition, I ſhall firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it as it appeared in thoſe ſeized with it in its moſt violent and fatal form; and afterwards treat more particularly of its moſt remarkable ſymptoms.</p>
            <p>The patient, without any previous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, ſuddenly becomes giddy; he loſes his eye-ſight; every thing ſeems to move round him with inconceivable velocity; he falls down almoſt inſenſible, and in that ſtate remains half an hour or upwards. During this paroxyſm the body feels cold, and is overſpread with cold ſweat, which iſſues from every pore in aſtoniſhing abundance. On his recovery, the cold goes off, and is inſtantly ſucceeded by intenſe heat, and quick, ſmall, hard pulſe; the head achs dreadfully, particularly the forehead and ſinciput, which is generally accompanied with pain in the right ſide, and at the prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia. The laſt, however, has never been acute, and may rather be called oppreſſion than pain. The eyes are much inflamed, watery, protruded, and wildly rolling; the
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:035302_0121_100218C4CE931C10"/>
face much fluſhed; much heat is felt at the pit of the ſtomach; and that organ ſeems to be conſiderably affected by the nauſea and frequent retching and vomiting, which then come on. The patient ſoon after com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of intolerable pain in the ſmall of his back, and in the calves of his legs; but the laſt appears to be the moſt violent, During twelve, eighteen, twenty-four, or thirty-ſix hours, theſe ſymptoms continue increaſing, except the quickneſs and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the pulſe, which do not change ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially during that time, and are then ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by general coldneſs, cold ſweat, a greater or leſs degree of coma and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium, or a ſtate very much reſembling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxication. Life in this ſtate is lengthened out to ſixty or ninety hours from the firſt attack. A ſhort interval of reaſon then takes place; the patient conſiders himſelf better, and is for a moment flattered with the proſpect of recovery; but a fit as ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and unexpected as the firſt comes on, during which he foams at the mouth, rolls his eyes dreadfully, and throws out and pulls back his extremities in violent and quick alternate ſucceſſion. In general the
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:035302_0122_100218C709C386E8"/>
patient expires in this fit; but ſome have recovered from it, and continued rational for a few hours longer, when a ſecond fit has carried them off. This has been the general progreſs of the diſeaſe in its worſt form; and indeed there have not been many deviations from it; the principal of theſe were, the general ſymptoms coming on without any preceding convulſion. The patient has been, in ſome inſtances, coma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toſe from the very commencement of the diſeaſe; others have had the diſeaſe uſhered in by a frequent ſucceſſion of ſhort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive fits, and it has afterwards been marked with conſtant delirium and cold clammy ſweat, without any intervening heat of ſurface, &amp;c. The diſeaſe too, in a few caſes, has ſeized the patient in the manner moſt other fevers come on; that is, with ſhivering and a ſenſe of cold. The moſt conſtant ſymptoms, and conſequently thoſe which diſtinguiſhed the diſeaſe, were the uncommon ſuddenneſs of its attack; the remarkably acute pain in the loins and calves of the legs: the watery, inflamed, and rolling eye; the fluſhing of the face; the tendency to coma from the very onſet;
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:035302_0123_100218CAADF27B50"/>
the peculiarity of the delirium attending; and the pain confined to the forehead ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom extending to the temples, or even to the ſinciput. However mild caſes might be in other reſpects, theſe were always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. In no diſeaſe I have ever met with, is the phyſician more liable to be deceived; for often when every ſymptom, indicating danger, has been apparently removed; when the ſkin has become cool, the pulſe ſeemingly natural, and the ſtomach ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive as to receive a large quantity of bark, convulſions ſuddenly ſeize the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and ſoon deprive him of life; or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirium and cold clammy ſweats ſuperſede the favourable appearances, and forerun diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. How applicable therefore is M. Tiſſot's compariſon of the malignant fever to a dog who bites without barking, to this inſidious diſeaſe before us: "L'on ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelle fievres malignes, celles dans leſquelles, le danger eſt plus grand, que les ſymptomes ne ſont effrayants.

The delirium attending this fever is of a peculiar caſt. During it, the countenance, the eyes, and the actions of the patient reſemble very much thoſe of a perſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ebriated. It is almoſt always mild, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver furious; but is accompanied conſtantly with reſtleſſneſs, and efforts to get out of bed. In a few inſtances theſe roſe ſo high, as to render the attempts of the aſſiſtants of no avail; the patients dreſſed themſelves, went out, and walked a conſiderable way before they could be overpowered. The mind ſeems agitated by the objects which were moſt its purſuit during health. An engineer, in his delirium, is continually em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in giving directions to the inferior officers, adviſing with them, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intending the labour of the workmen. A man much involved in debt, is inceſſantly arranging with his creditors. A ſoldier talks of the duty he is employed in, and ever and anon expreſſes his fear of the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer's diſpleaſure. A ſailor, in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, is ſolely engaged in maritime affairs. Scenes of former pleaſure are eagerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called, and preſented to the imagination in their moſt alluring circumſtances; and if a
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:035302_0125_100218CE725EBAC8"/>
momentary interval of reaſon takes place, the moſt piercing lamentations are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. But in all caſes of delirium, whatever the ſubject may be which the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient raves about, he is evidently and ſtrongly actuated by fear; and a word from the phyſician immediately reduces him to the moſt implicit obedience, however reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he might have been before. No pain is complained of during this ſtate; the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritation of bliſters has no effect in rouſing the patient; and the operation of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines that prove laxative, though not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered with that intention, paſſes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out obſervation, and without ſenſibility. The patient, on being queſtioned reſpecting his ſituation, ſeems to recognize the perſon who ſpeaks; but never complains of any thing; his anſwer being conſtantly that he is very well. Indeed, during the low ſtate of the fever, whether delirium is preſent or not, the ſenſations of the patient ſeem ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly imperfect; and inſtead of refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any ſymptom which the byſtanders perceive evidently, his anſwer invariably is, that he is very well; and ſenſible of no pain. During delirium, the patient's lips are in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:035302_0126_100218D00D5859F0"/>
motion; he is continually muttering, and he is continually attempting to reach to ſome object which his deranged imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation preſents to him. The ſtrength, during the delirious ſtate, appears to be ſurpriſingly great, for it is frequently neceſſary to uſe the united efforts of two or three men to keep the patient in bed. This is however no more than a ſpaſmodic affection of the muſcles, for in reality the powers of the ſick in this diſeaſe are reduced to the extreme of debility, as is ſeen in the convaleſcent ſtate. The delirium comes on generally at the commencement of the low ſtate, but is frequently preſent during the whole of the diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>Coma is the next moſt remarkable ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom in this fever. After the firſt two days there is always more or leſs tendency to it; but after the third day, if the patient ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives it, it has been in almoſt every inſtance, preſent. He appears drowſy, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of pain, or irritation of any kind; he moans and ſighs much, but is immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, unleſs called on. He generally lies on his back, with his eyes half open, the
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:035302_0127_100218D2409068C0"/>
balls of which do not appear to be capable of motion: if there is any it is extremely languid; their luſtre is alſo much dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. For ſome time I could not account for the ſupervention of this ſtate at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſtage of the diſeaſe: anxious to diſcover whether it depended on any peculiar af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the ſenſoriu<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, I examined the brain of two men who died on the fifth day. Theſe patients, after the ſymptoms ſtrictly febrile had abated, became coma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toſe; in which ſtate they continued till a convulſion put a period to their exiſtence on the fifth day. In the firſt I examined the upper part of the cranium, on being ſawed and prized up by a chiſſel, was ſo preſſed from inwards by the ſwelling of the cerebrum as to fly off, or ſeparate in ſuch a manner as if a ſpring from within acted on it. On cutting into the cerebrum, the quantity of ſerous fluid was ſurpriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly great; but as the greateſt part was loſt, it was impoſſible to aſcertain it. In the brain of the ſecond, the quantity of water was alſo conſiderable. After obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe appearances, I was led to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine more attentively the ſtate of the eyes
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:035302_0128_100218D4E5935AB0"/>
of my patients in this diſeaſe; and I have not the ſmalleſt heſitation in declaring, that in all thoſe who became comatoſe, there was a very conſiderable and permanent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latation of the pupils: an appearance which left no room to doubt reſpecting the ſtate of the brain, and the nature of the ſymptom it gave riſe to. I believe this appearance has not been noticed by writers on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Of thoſe at preſent in my poſſeſſion, M. Poiſſonier Deſperrieres alone mentions ſomething ſimilar—"quelquefois la ſurdite ſurvient, et quelquefois auſſi une goutte ſereine."<note n="8" place="bottom">

                  <p>Dr. Ruſh informs us, that a dilatation of the pupils was a very general ſymptom of the malignant peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential fever, as it appeared in Philadelphia.—"For a while I aſcribed this peculiarity in the pulſe (a ſmall intermitting, ſlow, and tenſe, or chorded pulſe) more eſpecially its <hi>ſlowneſs,</hi> to an affection of the brain only, and ſuſpected that it was produced by what I have taken the liberty elſewhere to call the <hi>phrenicula,</hi> or inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ſtate of the internal dropſy of the brain; and which I have remarked to be an occaſional ſymptom and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of remitting fever. I was the more diſpoſed to adopt this opinion, from perceiving this ſlow and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting pulſe more frequently in children than in adults. Impreſſed with this idea, I requeſted Mr. Coxe, one of my pupils, to aſſiſt me in examining the ſtate of the eye. For two days we diſcovered no change in it; but on the third day, after we began to inſpect the eyes, we both perceived a preternatural dilatation of the pupils in different patients; and we ſeldom after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſaw an eye in which it was abſent." <hi>An Account of the Bilious Remitting Yellow Fever,</hi> p. 42. The Dr. moſt judiciouſly laid much ſtreſs on this affection of the brain, in forming his indications of cure; and he declares that the mortality would have been infinitely leſs in his practice, had he earlier obſerved this ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and applied the appropriate remedy.

The appearance which marked the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the fever moſt unequivocally, was a ſpecies of effloreſcence, which is ſaid to be peculiar to malignant and peſtilential fevers: this effloreſcence reſembled more patches of red or livid ſpots, than what is generally underſtood by the word Petechiae; and appeared ſometimes at the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſlow or comatoſe ſtate; but oftener a few hours before death. It was a very fatal ſymptom; for I do not recollect a ſingle inſtance of recovery when it took place. The neck, ſhoulders, and breaſt were generally the parts of the body the erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion broke out on; but in a few very vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:035302_0130_100218D918DFAD00"/>
caſes, almoſt the whole body has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of a deep livid or black colour three hours before death. In one inſtance, a young woman juſt arrived from England, petechiae evidently appeared on her neck, breaſt, and arms; and it was the only one in which I perceived any thing of the kind; they conſtituted as fatal a ſign as the vibices, for the patient died ſoon after their eruption, on the third day of the fever. Theſe patches are well defined by Tiſſot, by comparing them to the wales or marks which remain after a ſevere drubbing.

            <p>The pains complained of in this fever, particularly thoſe of the head and legs, are in many reſpects peculiar to it. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is confined to the forehead, and ſhoots inwardly towards the bottom of the orbits,
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:035302_0131_100218DC0F977868"/>
where it is generally exquiſite; it alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times extends to the temples, where indeed there is always a throbbing. In no caſe has pain been felt in the occiput, or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally throughout the head. The albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginea of the eyes is always much inflamed at the ſame time; the balls are generally protruded, or ſeem ready to ſtart from their orbits; and the patient is ſenſible of a pain in them, which renders the admiſſion of light intolerable. It has ſometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that the right eye has been moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably affected; and when this has been the caſe, the pain has been moſt felt in the right ſide of the head. The pain in the legs has been always felt immediately below the calf, where the gaſtrocnemii and ſoleus muſcles unite and form the great tendon. A conſiderable involuntary contraction of the leg takes place in conſequence of it; and in the point where it is chiefly felt, it communicates a ſenſation ſimilar to gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which from time to time occaſions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme torture. Upon the whole, this pain reſembles very much the cramp; with this difference only, that it is, during the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the fever, more permanent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="117" facs="unknown:035302_0132_100218DDA452B8A8"/>
I have already obſerved, that at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of this fever the pulſe is quick, hard, and ſmall; and it is always ſo in the more violent caſes. It is often, however, very full at this period; and when it is ſo, it affords a favourable prognoſtic. But in no diſeaſe is the ſtate of the pulſe more ſubject to variation than in this before us. It has frequently happened, and more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially with the robuſt, that during the ſtage immediately ſucceeding the febrile one, fluſhing and chillineſs have oftentimes alternated in leſs than a minute; and that although the ſkin felt conſiderably warm, the pulſe has been no more than 52; but that, even when the low ſtate came on, in which there is always a diſagreeable cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſurface, it has been as quick and nearly as full as during the preceding febrile ſtage, although unaccompanied with thirſt, or any other evident ſymptom of the exiſtence of fever. One remarkable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of the pulſe in this diſeaſe is, that it never intermits; even at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of death it has not intermitted; but has been generally remarkably tremulous, and ſo ſlow, as to beat no more than thirty
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:035302_0133_100218DFD4337A70"/>
times in a minute. Upon the whole, I have never found it quicker than 130, nor ſlower than 30, in a minute.</p>
            <p>Subſultus tendinum is by no means a common ſymptom in the advanced ſtage; but tremor of the hands and of the lips, and violent ſpaſmodic contraction of the legs and arms are very common, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways prognoſticate much danger.</p>
            <p>The appearance of the tongue is very various; in ſome patients continuing white with florid edges to the very laſt; in others, becoming dark-coloured very early, and changing to black a little before death; but in general, the change of colour of the fur with which the tongue, teeth, and even the fauces are covered, is gradual. Thus, during the two firſt days it is a white or clayey; it afterwards becomes buffy; then of a deep orange; about the fifth day, browniſh; and when the caſe terminates in death, black. The thickneſs of the fur increaſes with the diſeaſe, and ſeems latterly to impede much the ſpeech of the patient. The edges of the tongue are generally florid, exactly
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:035302_0134_100218E16DC49938"/>
reſembling its appearance in chronic aphthae. I have not unfrequently ſeen the tongue have the appearance of having been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to foot, and covered with it: a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular circumſtance, and mentioned by no writer I am acquainted with, except M. Tiſſot. "Quelquefois cependant elle reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble exactement a une langue qui auroit été long-temps exposée a la fumée."<note n="10" place="bottom">P. 1. ch. 17.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Aphthae ſometimes occurred; and, I think, were generally a bad ſymptom. Thoſe I have ſeen were always of the white kind, reſembling curd, and have been accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with a thick fur of the ſame conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and colour on the teeth and gums. This ſymptom has been mentioned by Hux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham and Poiſſonnier; the former of whom ſays, "<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ut of much more uncertain and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous event are the brown dark-coloured aphthae; nor are thoſe that are exceeding white, and thick like lard, of a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing aſpect."</p>

There were two kinds of eruption about the lips, of a very oppoſite nature; one ſuch as frequently appears at the termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of common remittents, and indicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a favourable change; the other, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of black ſpots or ſpecks, ſuch as might be made by the point of a painter's fine pencil, all round the mouth, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the upper lip, and near the edge of the prolabium; and indicating with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty a fatal termination. The firſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally appeared about the fifty day; the latter about the beginning of the third, or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of the fourth day.</p>
            <p>Haemorrhage has occurred in this diſeaſe much oftener and more profuſely, and has been attended with more dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences than in any other, the ſcurvy perhaps excepted, that I have met with. In ſeveral inſtances, the immenſity of blood diſcharged has evidently been the more immediate cauſe of death. The robuſt, ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoric, and groſs habits have been the moſt ſubject to it. It has taken place from the noſtrils, mouth, anus, and urethra; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from the canthi of the eyes; but
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:035302_0136_100218E64851DA30"/>
never, I believe, from the ears or pores of the ſkin. The moſt profuſe diſcharge has been from the noſtrils and anus, and has frequently amounted to three or four pounds at a time; the ſtools having been on theſe occaſions entirely compoſed of pure blood. Towards the cloſe of life, the blood thus diſcharged has appeared granulous, or like ichor, with a ſediment of a black gritty ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and has been ſo extremely offenſive as to oblige all the attendants to keep at a conſiderable diſtance till the haemorrhage ceaſed. Haemorrhage, however, has never been critical, nor has it in any inſtance per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manently relieved the headach or pain in the breaſt or ſide. I have ſometimes been induced to think, that it had benefited the patient, by his declaring that the headach had abated in conſequence of it; but cold clammy ſweats, an almoſt imperceptible pulſe, and delirium or coma ſupervening ſoon after, evinced the imperfect ſtate of the patient's feelings, and the fallacy of the prognoſtic.</p>
            <p>Nearly about the period theſe profuſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges of blood came on, a rawneſs was

felt on the whole of the interior ſurface of the noſe; and on ſeveral parts of it, little ulcers formed; on others, ſmall eſcars, which were remarkably itchy; but on being touched, or an attempt made by the patient to detach them from the membrane of the noſe, were very painful, and bled. Theſe diſappeared in proportion to the patient's recovery; and I had much reaſon to ſuſpect that when the iſſue of the diſeaſe was fatal, theſe little eſcars became gangrenous.</p>
            <p>About the ſame time another ſymptom appeared in many inſtances; which, were it not for its ſingularity, might be conſidered as too minute to be mentioned among thoſe which diſtinguiſhed the diſeaſe. Its ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity ariſes chiefly from the ſilence of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern writers on the malignant hoſpital or jail fever, with reſpect to it; and from its appearing to be critical in the preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.<note n="11" place="bottom">Dr. Donald Monro mentions the occurrence of a ſwelling and ſubſequent ſuppuration of the teſticles in the malignant fever. <hi>Diſeaſes of the Army,</hi> 1ſt. Ed. p. 44. M. Poiſſonnier ſays only, "il ſe ſait bientôt des ecorehures dans certaines parties de leur corps, et la gangréne s'en empare malgré toutes les precautions qu'on lui oppoſe." tom. I. p. 291. I think ſomething of this kind is mentioned by Thucydides, in his cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated account of the Plague of Athens; but as I have not the original, I cannot ſpeak with certainty. In Dr. Clifton's tranſlation of this part of Thucydides's hiſtory, there is the following paſſage: "For the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe went through the whole body, beginning firſt in the head; and, if any eſcaped, where the caſe was very deſperate, this was denoted by the extremities being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; for it broke out <hi>upon the private parts,</hi> the fingers, and toes,' &amp;c. <hi>Clifton's Tranſlation of Hyppocrates upon Air, Water, and Situation,</hi> &amp;c. Ed. 1739, p. 97. Hippocrates in ſeveral places mentions an affection of the ſcrotum and teſticles in malignant and peſtilential fevers. Does this afford a collateral proof of the peſtilential nature of the diſeaſe before us? A remarkable caſe of this kind occurred in the month of May, 1794. Mr. O'Hara, an officer of his Majeſty's 56th regiment, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commonly robuſt, and aged about twenty, having been ſeized with all the uſual ſymptoms in the more violent degree of the Boullam Fever, as it was then diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, had on the 4th day a very large diſcharge of purulent matter from the urethra, attended with very conſiderable ſwelling of the ſcrotum. The diſcharge continued to increaſe all the 5th; and I began to form a favourable prognoſtic from it. On the 6th, however, it became ichorous; the penis ſwelled to a monſtrous ſize, as did the ſcrotum; and both began to change to a black colour. Theſe unfavourable appearances in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed rapidly the 7th and 8th, and the diſcharge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came then a putrid ſanies, exceſſively offenſive. On the day of his death, the 9th, the ſcrotum was fully nine inches in diameter, and the penis three; and both were completely mortified and black. During the latter days of his illneſs, he loſt a prodigious quantity of blood from the noſe, mouth, ears, eyes, and even from the pores of his ſkin.</note> About the end of the ſecond day,
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:035302_0138_100218EA5570E440"/>
the patient begins to complain of a violent pain in his teſticles; on queſtioning him, he
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:035302_0139_100218ED4B91EDE8"/>
ſays he feels a contraction of the ſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic chord, and is ſenſible of a drawing up of the teſticles towards the abdominal ring. On examination they appear very much leſſened in ſize, are drawn up conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably towards the abdomen; and the ſcrotum appears at the ſame time remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably flaccid and empty. The ſurface of the ſcrotum becomes ſoon after very pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and an excoriation takes place, chiefly at the moſt deſcending part, from which a conſiderable quantity of very offenſive pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulent matter iſſues: at the ſame time a ſimilar diſcharge from the urethra takes place; which ceaſes with the diſeaſe when the event is favourable, or becomes icho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous or bloody, and inſufferably foetid when death is the conſequence. In caſes which
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:035302_0140_100218EEDE957BA8"/>
terminate favourably, the whole of the ſcro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum in a few days is covered with a coat of hardened pus, which, in the convaleſcent ſtate, comes away very eaſily by means of a warm bath. The thickneſs of this coat way be about a fourth of a line, and when ſeparated, reſembles much moiſtened parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In fatal caſes, this affection of the ſcrotum always terminates in gangrene a few hours before death.</p>
            <p>The change of voice is very remarkable in this fever; for from a ſtrong tenor or manly ſound, it ſinks to a treble, or a ſound much ſofter, lower, and ſhriller than the natural one; the ſyllables are more diſtinguiſhed, and the words are ſtrangely lengthened out in a draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or whining manner. In the patients who have ſunk under this diſeaſe, the change of voice happens much earlier, and more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably than in others. It has therefore always afforded me a pretty certain prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtic of the event; for any alteration of the ſound towards the natural one, is an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt certain ſign of a favourable change.</p>
            <p>A ſuppreſſion of urine is by no means an uncommon ſymptom in the bilious remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:035302_0141_100218F0728238B8"/>
of the country; and, in general, it is a circumſtance which often occurs in fevers of a ſynochus or typhus character; but in the malignant peſtilential fever, it is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly remarkable for its coming on early, its duration, and the cauſe which ſeems to produce it. In the third volume of the Edinburgh Literary Eſſays, there is a very ingenious and uſeful paper on the affection of the urinary bladder, which Dr. Gilchriſt, the author, has called a "thickening of the bladder." To this I might refer for a deſcription of the ſtate of the bladder occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioning urinary ſuppreſſion in this fever; for on diſſection it appears exactly ſimilar. Here I ſhall only obſerve, that the ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is accompanied by a violent pain above the os pubis; a ſcalding in the urethra; a ſenſe of fullneſs, without any viſible tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſcence in the region of the pubes; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable contraction and contortion of the penis; and the urine is generally of a very deep red colour; ſometimes browniſh; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times green; very frequently bloody; and, in a few inſtances, much inclining to black, and of an oily conſiſtence. The ſmell of the urine was generally offenſive in the higheſt
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:035302_0142_100218F3A0487338"/>
degree. Indeed, all the excretions were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably foetid; but the ſtools were more eſpecially ſo. Conſtipation almoſt univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally prevailed: a circumſtance extremely unfavourable, as the means uſed to obviate it always increaſed the tendency to putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, by bringing on debility propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to their effect. This appeared to ariſe from a ſuſpenſion of tone in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtinal canal; for on exciting the fibres to act, a redundant evacuation was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the conſequence. The faeces at the commencement of the diſeaſe were ſeldom very foetid; but, during its progreſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came exceſſively ſo; and, a little before death, when they were diſcharged inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, the ſmell was intolerable. The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and conſiſtence of this diſcharge varied much; from yellow, or a yellowiſh white to black; and from a conſiderable degree of thickneſs, to the exact appearance of coffee-grounds. The diſcharge by vomiting, which became a moſt dangerous ſymptom at the commencement of the low ſtate, alſo varied much; although for the moſt part pora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; but towards the fatal criſis, always black, and reſembling coffee badly boiled.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="unknown:035302_0143_100218F534EF7BB0"/>
The thirſt was not very conſiderable in general, and no very uſeful indication could be drawn from the ſtate of it. It was, however, a bad ſign when the thirſt ceaſed, eſpecially if at the ſame time the tongue appeared parched, cracked, and black.</p>
            <p>A principal diſtinction between this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe and typhus icteroides, is the yellow ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, which in the former very ſeldom hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened; in the latter almoſt always. But as this appearance can never be conſidered as a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing ſymptom in any highly malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant fever, it frequently occurring where the other ſymptoms point out a diſeaſe differing eſſentially from that in which it moſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally takes place, it will be ſufficient to mention, that in ſome protracted caſes on ſhore, and in ſome among the ſailors which might have been a combination of the peſtilential and yellow fevers, this ſymptom appeared about the 5th, 7th, or 9th day.</p>
            <p>Moſt other diſeaſes degenerated into, or partook very much of the nature of this. Dyſenteries ſuddenly ſtopped, and were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſucceeded by the ſymptoms of the
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:035302_0144_100218F779C66BA8"/>
peſtilential fever. A remarkable inſtance of this occurred in the month of July, 1793. About the beginning of the month, twenty-ſeven recruits joined the detachment of royal artillery in this iſland. Theſe men formed part of the artillery, which, with other troops under the command of Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Bruce, landed on the iſland of Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nique about the middle of June. During the three days they remained on ſhore, they were encamped, and almoſt the whole time expoſed to very heavy rain. Dyſenteries were the conſequence; and moſt of them, on their arrival here, were immediately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the royal artillery hoſpital; where at that time, as has been already obſerved, there were many caſes of the peſtilential fever. The apparent effect of the medicines they took very much ſurpriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me; but I ſoon found that the original diſeaſe only yielded to one more powerful; for in a few hours after the ſymptoms of dyſentery diſappeared, thoſe of the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential fever came on. Catarrhal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, ſimple at firſt, ſoon changed their nature: convaleſcents from other diſeaſes were very ſubject to this, but it generally
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:035302_0145_100218F91A4109F0"/>
proved mild. Thoſe labouring at the time under chronic complaints, particularly rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſm and hepatitis, were alſo very ſubject to it. The puerperal fever became malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and of courſe fatal; and even among pregnant negro-women, who otherwiſe might have had it in the uſual mild degree peculiar to that deſcription of people, were reduced to a very dangerous ſituation by it. In ſhort, every diſeaſe, in which the patient was liable to infection, ſooner or later aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the appearance, and acquired the danger of the peſtilential fever.</p>
            <p>Although the contagion ſeemed to vary much in different deſcriptions of people, it is highly probable that the virus of the contagion itſelf was uniformly the ſame, only variouſly modified by peculiar conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, habits, or modes of living. Thus among ſailors, perhaps a ſcorbutic taint, joined to extreme irregularity and impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, rendered the diſeaſe infinitely more fatal than among any other claſs of men. On the other hand, among field-negroes who certainly poſſeſs an idioſyncraſy peculiar to themſelves, and whoſe mode of living is
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:035302_0146_100218FBD40F8368"/>
generally temperate and regular in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable degree, the virus of the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was ſo blunted, as to act in the mildeſt form. Why, however, it ſhould operate with moſt violence on Europeans juſt arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and who had never entered the torrid zone before, is a ſingularity I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to explain. The advice of Celſus is very applicable in the preſent inſtance, and may afford us a hint with reſpect to the cauſe of this ſingularity: "Si plenior ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis, et ſpecioſior, et coloratior factus eſt, ſuſpecta habere ſua bona debet."<note n="11" place="bottom">Lib. II. cap. 2.</note> Every thing debilitating prediſpoſed the body to be acted on by this contagion; fear; an hypochondriacal diſpoſition; inebriation; faſting, or viſiting the ſick with an empty ſtomach; great fatigue; entering the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the ſick in full perſpiration, &amp;c. But whatever were the prediſpoſing cauſes, the contagion always acted within four days from its application to the body. I am aware of the difficulty of aſcertaining the time which contagion takes to act on the ſyſtem after its admiſſion into it; but my
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:035302_0147_100218FE447576D8"/>
ſituation afforded me many opportunities of knowing it with ſufficient exactneſs. In ſome inſtances, ſymptoms of its action have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in ſix hours; in others, in twenty hours; in others in forty-eight; and in others, not till the expiration of the fourth day; ſo that, in general, we may conſider the ſpace of time required for the production of diſeaſe conſequent upon the application of the contagion, as about a trifle ſhort of two days. For although all from whom I have received the information which has enabled me to make the above calculation, have been ſenſible of receiving the contagion, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant it was applied, by nauſea and ſlight rigor indicating it, yet thoſe ſymptoms were only momentary. I do not know that this point has been much attended to; at leaſt the writers I have been able to conſult, ſeem ſilent on the ſubject. Dr. Guthrie of St. Peterſburgh, from the information he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the medical gentlemen of the Ruſſian army, as well as from the event of the inoculation for the plague in one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ſeems inclined to fix the time of action of peſtilential contagion, at the fourth
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:035302_0148_10021900ABDCB6C8"/>
day.<note n="13" place="bottom">Medical Commentaries, vol. 8.</note> And as the diſeaſes are not diſſimilar, on the contrary, are much of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, his authority may be conſidered as ſtrongly corroborative of my obſervation. The importance of aſcertaining this point with tolerable preciſion, is evident; preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion altogether depending on it.</p>
            <p>Another point ſubject to much uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, and a good deal agitated among phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, is the diſtance at which it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to communicate the contagion. The reſult of my inquiries and obſervation on this ſubject amounts to the following facts: 1. That thoſe who moſt carefully avoid houſes where the infection is, are the moſt certain to eſcape it. 2. That although the diſeaſe is in the ſame houſe, avoiding the chamber of the ſick, prevents infection. 3. That the merely entering the chamber of the ſick, without nearly approaching the diſeaſed perſon, has never communicated infection. 4. That approaching ſo near the diſeaſed perſon as to be ſenſible of the foetor of his breath; or of the peculiar ſmell
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:035302_0149_100219027B76DEB0"/>
which is always emitted from the bodies of the ſick in this diſeaſe; or to touch the bed-clothes he lies on, generally occaſions nauſea, ſlight rigors, and often headach at the moment, and ſome hours after the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe itſelf. 5. That actual contact, ſo that the perſpired fluid of the ſick perſon may adhere to the hands, &amp;c. of the healthy perſon, more certainly produces this diſeaſe. 6. That touching the wearing apparel of a perſon who is actually diſeaſed, or has juſt recovered from the diſeaſe, as certainly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates the infection to the healthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And, 7. That frequently the merely paſſing a perſon infected, or who wears the clothes he had on during the exiſtence of the diſeaſe, in ſuch a manner as that the effluvia proceeding from them may be blown on the healthy perſon, has produced the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. From hence it is evident, that the infectious effluvia do not extend themſelves beyond a limited diſtance from the perſon or thing from which they are emitted; and this diſtance may be fixed at the utmoſt at ſix or ten feet. Dr. Lind, however, thinks that "in the open free air, this infection does not appear to diffuſe itſelf above fifty
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:035302_0150_10021905712B43D8"/>
ſixty feet from its nidus; though even at that diſtance a perſon might run ſome riſque from being expoſed to a current of air highly impregnated with the contagion which immediately iſſued from a door or window, where it had been long pent up.<note n="14" place="bottom">Dr. James Lind's Eſſays, Ed. 1774, p. 319.</note> Although this, during the time the malignant peſtilential fever prevailed here, never, I believe, happened, both accounts may be reconciled, by allowing for the influence of heat in this climate, occaſioning ſuch a degree of rarefaction of the air as to prevent the diffuſion of contagion beyond the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere immediately ſurrounding the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed or infected body, the radius of which may be eſtimated at ſix or ten feet. And Dr. Blane very juſtly obſerves, that "viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent matter is of ſuch a degree of volatility as to be readily diſſipated in a certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of heat."<note n="15" place="bottom">Diſeaſes of Seamen, p. 279.</note> But whatever the limits of infection may be with reſpect to its power of acting on healthy bodies, much muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the ſtate of theſe bodies at the time they are expoſed to the contagion.</p>
            <p>

The danger attending the opening of bodies in this diſeaſe, prevented me from extending my inquiries this way ſo far as I otherwiſe would have done. I opened only five, the appearances in which I ſhall here give an account of. Three of the five were ſailors, who died on the fifth day, and laboured under the worſt ſymptoms of the diſeaſe. In one of them it began and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated with convulſive paroxyſms. The inteſtines were much inflated, inflamed, and ſphacelated, particularly the duodenum, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle beyond the pylorus; the liver had ſhrunk to leſs than one-half its natural ſize, was uncommonly flaccid, and of a colour nearly approaching to buff; or a mixture of yellow and that of aſhes; the gall-bladder was flaccid and greyiſh, and contained a ſmall quantity of very dark-coloured, ropey bile. The ſpleen and pancreas were in a natural ſtate; but the lungs were highly inflamed, and of a livery texture and hue: a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance the more extraordinary, as no ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of marked pulmonary affection could be perceived during the exiſtence of the diſeaſe. The bladder contained near three quarts of urine; and was dilated to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:035302_0152_1002190980C47CC8"/>
above the os pubis; and its coats were much thickened. This patient had been conſtantly tormented with pain, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole region of the pelvis, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a total ſuppreſſion of urine.</p>
            <p>The ſecond was remarkably robuſt and athletic, and had been ſeized with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe in the form of an aguiſh paroxyſm; but died ſtrongly convulſed. The viſcera were in general in the ſame ſtate, particularly the liver. All the veſſels of the inteſtines were uncommonly turgid; the right kidney was mortified; although, during his illneſs, no ſymptom of inflammation of that organ was perceived. The quantity of urine was ſmall, although the ſuppreſſion had been conſiderable; and the bladder, a good deal enlarged, felt much like an elaſtic gum-ſyringe; the coats very much thickened, but renitent.</p>
            <p>The principal morbid appearances in the bodies of the third and fourth, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready deſcribed. Theſe two were the only ſubjects in which I examined the ſtate of the brain. To what I have already ſaid on
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:035302_0153_1002190B1525FC78"/>
the diſſection of theſe two bodies, I have only to add, that the viſcera of the abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and thorax, were exactly in the ſame ſtate as the others; and that one was a young man of the royal artillery, about 18 years of age, who arrived with his maſter, Capt. Irwin of that corps, about ſix weeks before; was remarkably florid, robuſt, and lively; and obſtinately refuſed to avail him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of medical aſſiſtance during the whole of his illneſs. In the brain of this young man, the quantity of blood was ſurpriſingly great; for, excluſive of what was loſt in opening the cranium, fully two pounds were collected. In the left ventricle the quantity of water was alſo conſiderable; but there was none in the right. The fourth ventricle contained a larger quantity than ordinary; and the plexus choroides was almoſt obliterated. There was no poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous concretion in either of the ventricles of the heart.</p>
            <p>In the fifth, a young man of the royal artillery, juſt arrived from England, who died in twenty-nine hours from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of the fever, the appearance of
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:035302_0154_1002190D791C54B0"/>
the viſcera was exactly the ſame. This man's fever abated conſiderably on the breaking out of a copious diaphoreſis; his ſtomach was remarkably retentive, which enabled him to take at leaſt two ounces of bark in a very few hours. As he was preparing to take a doſe of this medicine, he felt a little uneaſineſs at his ſtomach, which induced him to defer it; but on lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his head on the pillow, he expired without a groan, or the leaſt ſtruggle.</p>
            <p>Mr. White, mate to the 45th regiment, who at that time attended the hoſpital of the regiment, with much and deſerved credit to himſelf, opened ſeveral bodies of ſoldiers who died of the malignant peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential fever; and he in all remarked the ſame appearances I have above deſcribed. He did not examine the brain in any inſtance but from the ſymptoms, particularly the coma, delirium, and dilatation of the pupils, being exactly ſimilar, little doubt can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main with reſpect to the ſtate of it.</p>
            <p>I may here obſerve, that the appearances in the bodies of twenty which were opened
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:035302_0155_1002191071B47CC0"/>
at Breſt, were almoſt exactly ſimilar, that of the liver in particular, which M. Poiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonnier ſays was livid, flaccid, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread with cineritious and blackiſh ſpots, under which were ſmall drops of clotted and ill-conditioned blood—"le foie de plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieurs ſe trouve livide, molleſſe, et par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fémé de taches cendrées et noirâtres, ſous leſquelles on apercevoit des gouttelletes de ſang grumélé et denaturée."<note n="16" place="bottom">Tom. I. p. 334.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The only material difference which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears between the diſſections deſcribed by Sir John Pringle, and thoſe which were made here is, that in his there were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſceſſes in the brain; whereas in ours, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable quantity of ſerous fluid in one, and of ſerous fluid and blood in another, alone were found. But this difference, I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, may be very readily accounted for by the very rapid progreſs of the diſeaſe in our caſes, and the length of time to which thoſe Sir John Pringle treated, were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted. In ours, the diſeaſe terminated fatally in five days; in his, death did not
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:035302_0156_100219120C58DF98"/>
happen till the expiration of a fortnight or a month.<note n="17" place="bottom">Diſeaſes of the Army, 7th ed. p. 301. It is ſingular that no mention is made, by this illuſtrious phyſician, of dilatation of the pupils of the eyes. Does this ſymptom diſtinguiſh the two diſeaſes?</note>
            </p>
            <p>From the circumſtances of this diſeaſe related in the foregoing ſheets, it will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily appear that the mode of termination could not with certainty be foretold by any one of them alone. The particular ſtate of any of the excretions, unleſs the changes which took place in the other ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms were at the ſame time attended to, could not afford any preciſe prognoſtic. In a word, it was only from attention to the general ſtate of the patient, we could form any idea of what the event might be. It is a general obſervation, that in malignant fevers the critical periods are more diſtinctly marked than in any other; the diſeaſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us affords an additional proof of this. I have not met with any diſeaſe in this cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, in which the periods were more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly aſcertained. The diſappearance of the diſeaſe, or the death of the patient,

always happened on the odd days; but the change in the ſtate of the diſeaſe, which preceded either event, took place on even days. Thus, if the patient was worſe on the evening of the ſecond day, he would die on the third; if worſe on the fourth, he would die on the fifth; and ſo on, as far as the fourteenth day. Beyond that period, I have not ſeen an inſtance of the diſeaſe ending fatally, although it has been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, in a few inſtances, to the 21ſt day. In the ſame manner, if the patient felt better, or if there was an evident abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſymptoms on the 2d, 4th, 6th, &amp;c. days, the reſolution of the diſeaſe would happen on the following days. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the ſubjoined Table of the ſtate of the patients in the royal artillery hoſpital, who recovered, and died, will illuſtrate this point more fully than any other mode of expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. I make choice of this in preference to any other part of my practice, becauſe there my obſervations were neceſſarily more accurate; and becauſe few in private life enjoy the advantages which the ſick of the royal artillery do; ariſing from the very liberal manner in which their hoſpitals are

The very uncommon malignity which marked this diſeaſe after its appearance, and during its progreſs here, and ſome of its ſymptoms reſembling thoſe of peſtilence; the manner too in which it was introduced, and afterwards propagated among the ſailors, garriſon, and inhabitants, will induce us to conſider it as in no ſmall degree partak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the nature of true plague. It is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally agreed among writers, who have themſelves ſeen and treated the diſeaſe in all its various forms, that the only ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, which can be with propriety conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as characteriſtic of the plague, are the buboes and carbuncles which appear about the critical period, and generally forerun a reſolution of the diſeaſe; but it has been at the ſame time allowed, that the plague does ſometimes appear without buboes. Whether the diſeaſe in queſtion may be claſſed among the peſtilential or not, I leave to thoſe to determine who have more leiſure and fitter opportunities than I have. I ſhall only further obſerve on this head, that I have not ſeen carbuncles in any caſe which ended in death; but that in many who recovered they were nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:035302_0161_1002191D574759C0"/>
large, and very troubleſome. Theſe occurred chiefly in the young and robuſt; and always about the period the dangerous ſymptoms diſappeared; and indeed ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly did the appearance of the carbuncles fall in with the favourable change in the diſeaſe, that I have always conſidered them as a critical diſcharge: the only thing of the kind, except the purulent diſcharge from the ſcrotum and urethra, I have been able to obſerve in this fever. Swellings on the parotids, and buboes in the groins and arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits alſo occurred in ſeveral caſes; but theſe generally terminated in death.</p>
            <p>When this diſeaſe firſt appeared here, and for ſome time after, the prevalent opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was, that it was the yellow-fever of the Weſt-Indies, engrafted on the European jail-fever. But it muſt appear from the foregoing account, that though it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently of the nature of jail-fever, height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by ſome peſtilential ſymptoms, it does not partake in the leaſt of the typhus ic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teroides. The moſt obvious circumſtances which diſtinguiſh the two diſeaſes are the following: The nature of the delirium in
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:035302_0162_1002191EF0787668"/>
the malignant peſtilential fever is ſingular, and reſembles that in the plague, being marked with the fatuity, ſillineſs, and the ſtammering and faultering of the voice pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to that malady; the delirium in yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-fever is generally more of the wild, furious kind, and is never attended with the circumſtances mentioned. The yellow-fever is endemic and ſporadic; the other, epidemic, and imported from another coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The yellow-fever is always influenced by the weather; and, indeed, depends al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together on the heat of climate; the other, till of late, was thought to be peculiar to the temperate and cold climates. The one is evidently cauſed by marſh effluvia, heat, violent exerciſe in that heat; thick, hot, moiſt atmoſphere; night air, and dews; and the abuſe of ſpirituous liquors. The other, on the contrary, is cauſed by contagion alone. This is certainly the moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able difference; and conſtitutes an obvious, clear, and undiſputable diagnoſis. I have never in any inſtance, and I have ſeen many, of yellow-fever, known it to be contagious: it has always been evidently produced by the cauſes mentioned; and other perſons on
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:035302_0163_100219221A15A878"/>
board the ſaid ſhip, or in the ſame houſe, have continued in perfect health. But what more poſitively demonſtrates the difference between the two diſeaſes is, that the yellow-fever has been known in the Weſt Indies ever ſince the firſt eſtabliſhment of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies; the malignant peſtilential fever ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, I believe, till the year 1793. When the yellow-fever appeared at Barbadoes in 1721, Dr. Warren, who then practiſed there, was induced from its violence, and the ſeeming likeneſs of many of the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, to call it a ſpecies of the plague im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from Marſeilles to Martinique, and from thence to Barbadoes. That it was not peſtilential, however, is manifeſt from the united teſtimony of contemporary practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners, and from the account given by Mr. Hughes, the Natural Hiſtorian of the colony at that period.<note n="18" place="bottom">The Rev. Mr. Griffith Hughes's <hi>Natural Hiſtory of Barbadoes,</hi> folio ed. p. 37, 38. Dr. William Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary, 2d ed. <hi>On the Air and Diſeaſes in Barbadoes,</hi> p. 144, 145. M. Pouppé Deſportes, in his deſcription of the yellow-fever, correſponds exactly with the idea he gives of it in his Conſtitutions of the different Years: "On a ignoré pendant long-temps les funeſtes effets de cette maladie dans les iſles; la regularité avec laquelle elle ſe reproduit, ſemble devoir la faire regarder comme une de ces maladies dont il faut chercher la cauſe dans la conſtitution de l'air." <hi>Hiſtoire des Maladies de S. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingue,</hi> tom. I. p. 191. The attentive peruſal of this writer's Conſtitutions of the Air at Cape Francois from 1732 to 1748, when he died, will give a much better idea of the cauſes and nature of the yellow-fever, or "Maladie de Siam," as he calls it, than all that has been written on the ſubject by others—to thoſe who are not practically acquainted with it.</note>

Upon the whole therefore, if we draw our concluſion with reſpect to the diag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtic of this diſeaſe, from the remote and proximate cauſes, from the ſymptoms, from the diſſections, I apprehend, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it as truly peſtilential, and differing from the plague ſtrictly ſo called, only, in not always exhibiting the ſymptoms that are ſaid to be peculiar to that malady.</p>
            <p>The ſudden manner in which this fever attacked, in every caſe, rendered it impoſſible to adminiſter any thing in the way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. Had the ſick, indeed, been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſenſible of the infection the inſtant it was applied, no doubt much might have been done in this way; but unfortunately
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:035302_0165_10021925E3D825C0"/>
this happened in very few inſtances, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively ſpeaking; and when it did, none were willing to believe that any dangerous conſequence would enſue. In the cure therefore of the diſeaſe, I was always obliged to begin at, or ſoon after its actual invaſion; but as the ſymptoms very ſeldom directed to a proper knowledge of its true nature; and as the fatal termination often happened at a very early period, and unexpectedly, I found it a moſt difficult as well as painful taſk, for ſome time after the diſeaſe broke out, to form a plan of cure. Finding at length the total inefficacy of the uſual method recommended in treating malignant fevers; and becoming by conſtant obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation on a multitude of caſes, in its moſt violent form, better acquainted with the diſeaſe, I founded my plan on the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reaſoning. It was evident, however indirectly marked by the ſymptoms, that the firſt ſtage of the fever was an inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory diatheſis, peculiar in this reſpect, that its tendency to terminate in gangrene was infinitely greater than in any other diſeaſe I ever met with. It was no leſs evident that this ſtage was ſucceeded by
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:035302_0166_100219278155C430"/>
one wherein nervous excitement and a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſcent diatheſis were equally remarkable, and equally tended with an uncommon ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity to the diſſolution of the patient. It was alſo evident, that theſe diatheſes had an extraordinary aptitude to run into each other, without ſhowing any diſtinct ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the one, or acceſſion of the other; and it appeared, that the imprudent uſe, or the anticipation of the means of obviating either of theſe ſtates or diatheſes, inevitably haſtened the progreſs of the other to its peculiar termination. Having theſe facts before me, it was clear that if I at once went on the antiphlogiſtic plan, I would, with certainty, anticipate the fatal iſſue of the diſeaſe, by inducing an extreme degree of debility; and that, on the other hand, if I adopted at the commencement of my treatment, the antiſeptic plan, I would inevitably increaſe the tendency of the exiſting inflammation to terminate in gangrene. Many proofs of both theſe fatal errors occurred daily for ſome time after the introduction of the diſeaſe; and ſurely the practitioner could not be blamed when it is conſidered that the diſeaſe was new, and
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:035302_0167_10021929B258F638"/>
unknown in the climate. From the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going data, the following indications natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally reſulted, and always guided me in my future practice; for however varied the remedies might be, ſtill theſe were the points to be gained:</p>
            <p n="1">1. To diſcharge from the ſtomach and inteſtines acrid and offenſive humours.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To obviate inflammatory diatheſis, without producing a tendency to putreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To moderate the tendency to putreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and to obviate it when actually preſent.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To reſtore tone and energy to the ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>In the remittent fever of the country, and indeed in every diſeaſe in which there is a bilious accumulation in the primae viae, I have generally uſed a ſolution of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron vitriolatum and tartariſed antimony in water, in preference to any other eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuating
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:035302_0168_1002192BE2F3F7B0"/>
medicine. It poſſeſſes this ſingular advantage of effecting three evacuations in a very ſhort ſpace of time; and although a powerful emetic, it by no means occaſions any untoward irritability of ſtomach. In the preſent inſtance I had recourſe to this excellent remedy, and gave it in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner: An ounce and an half of the ſalts, and two grains of the tartariſed antimony, being diſſolved in a pound and an half of pure cold water, a large wine-glaſsfull of the ſolution was given every hour to the patient, until a ſufficient effect was produced, or till the whole of the quantity was taken. The two firſt glaſsfulls generally operated as an emetic, and fully evacuated the ſtomach; the medicine after this acted on the inteſtines, and excited a copious diſcharge of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents. If, at the ſame time, a diaphoreſis broke out (and it almoſt always did) the patient found himſelf conſiderably relieved. I have ſometimes, however, dreading the conſequence of copious evacuation by ſtool, contented myſelf with an emetic alone, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of from ten to thirty grains of ipeca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuanha, and one or two of the tartariſed antimony; but any advantage derived from
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:035302_0169_1002192D890F2720"/>
this practice, did not compenſate for the loſs of time; for if a gentle purge was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered after the operation of the emetic, it took ſeveral hours to produce its effect: and if clyſters were depended on, their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did not extend beyond the larger in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines. In ſeveral caſes of the third claſs, and a very few of the ſecond, in which my aſſiſtance was called for very early in the fever, I had the ſatisfaction of ſeeing a ſpeedy and complete termination put to the complaint, by the ſolution. This, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, was doing what has been recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by Sir John Pringle, preventing the diſeaſe, or rather carrying off its fomites before they can act generally on the ſyſtem; but perhaps the means were better. When the diſeaſe firſt appeared among us, fear of anticipating the irritability of ſtomach, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſome practitioners, and myſelf before I became fully acquainted with the diſeaſe, to give at firſt a pill of ſolid opium, and after allowing an hour or two for its ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to adminiſter the evacuating medicine; but for the reaſons already given, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety of this practice muſt be obvious. As it is highly probable, from the manner
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:035302_0170_1002192FBB291C70"/>
in which the contagion acted, that it was carried into the ſyſtem chiefly by means of the ſtomach and inteſtines, the importance of adminiſtering a medicine which in the ſhorteſt ſpace of time poſſible will evacuate them, at the ſame time that it tends to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate any general febrile affection which may have taken place, muſt be evident. I have often derived conſiderable advantage from uſing the bitter purging-ſalts, inſtead of Glauber's, either in the ſame proportion, or a larger one; and I have rendered the ſolution much more palatable by the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of lime-juice and ſugar.</p>
            <p>To fulfil the ſecond indication was infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more difficult; and the danger of making an improper choice of the means, much greater. The fate indeed of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient altogether depended on the judicious ſelection of means, in removing the inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory without producing a tendency to putreſcent diatheſis.</p>
            <p>It has been very generally recommended to draw ſome, blood before other means are uſed, at the beginning of malignant and
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:035302_0171_10021932C40E6420"/>
peſtilential fevers. In the preſent inſtance, the ardent heat of the ſurface, the oppreſſed hard pulſe, the pain of the ſide, the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion at the praecordia, the headach, and the throbbing in the temples, ſeemed ſtrongly to indicate the uſe of bleeding. Very little experience, however, was ſufficient to ſhew the impropriety of it; and inſtructed by repeated examples of its hurtful effects, I very early laid aſide all thoughts of leſſening the inflammatory ſtate by means of it. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the blood, drawn in the caſes wherein this remedy was employed, was remarkably florid, and always threw up an inflammatory cruſt of greater or leſs thickneſs; and although the pains ſeemed to undergo a temporary mitigation, yet the conſequence at the expiration of a few hours was always fatal. I was the more ſurpriſed at this event, as the patients were remarkably robuſt, florid, and generally in the vigor of life.</p>
            <p>Having thoroughly cleanſed the primae viae, my next object was to encourage a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aphoreſis, if it had already come on, which I have obſerved often happened in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:035302_0172_1002193456D26458"/>
of the uſe of the evacuating medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine; or if it had not, to promote one. For this purpoſe, I made uſe of various means; ſuch as the ſaline draughts of Rive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, with and without the addition of the aethereal ſpirit of nitre or vitriol; and I often preferred this addition, on account of the ſuppreſſion of urine. In all caſes, the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of which did not run high, this was a moſt uſeful medicine; and although the taſte was often complained of, it ſeldom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranged the ſtomach. With this I generally gave a powder every two hours, compoſed of nitre, camphor, and the pulvis antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nialis; and in order to give theſe medicines a greater tendency to act on the ſkin, a few drops of laudanum were occaſionally added to the draught, or a ſmall proportion of opium joined to the powder. Perſeverance in this plan, in the leſs violent caſes, was ſometimes attended with complete ſucceſs; for the pulſe becoming ſlower and ſoft, the pains abating, and the ſkin being covered with an agreeable moiſture, all that remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to complete the cure, was to prevent the tendency to putreſcence by the liberal uſe of bark, wine, and nouriſhing food.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="unknown:035302_0173_10021894B8A6EE00"/>
This ſucceſs, however, was confined to the third, and a very ſmall part of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond claſs of patients. The more violent caſes of the diſeaſe, in which the patients were hurried out of exiſtence, wherein the whole frame was agitated by a conflict the moſt dreadful, demanded a treatment in which the moſt vigorous and ſpeedy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, the boldeſt perſeverance in the adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed plan, and the cloſeſt attention and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation became abſolutely neceſſary. In theſe caſes local inflammation was more clearly indicated than in others; but bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was, if poſſible, a more dangerous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy here than in them. Finding all the antiphlogiſtics I had uſed totally ineffectual, and that bleeding was on no account ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſible, I had recourſe to the only remedy left me, mercury. I was encouraged to the practice by the appearances I obſerved in the two firſt bodies I opened. The liver was evidently the moſt diſeaſed part, and I knew that mercury was ſpecific in all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamations of that organ; beſides, it was at all events better to try a doubtful one than remedies of no efficacy. I accordingly adminiſtered calomel either combined with
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:035302_0174_10021936B7247480"/>
nitre, camphor, and the antimonial powder, or in the form of a pill. After many trials of both, I preferred the laſt, chiefly on account of the nitre and camphor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing with the ſtomach. The pill was generally compoſed of five grains of calo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel, two of the antimonial powder, and one of opium; and repeated four times in the twelve hours, or eight in the twenty-four hours. I confeſs it was with no ſmall degree of anxiety I ventured on this practice, unwarranted by any other authority than diſſection and my own obſervation; but its ſucceſs juſtified my temerity. If ſalivation was ſpeedily raiſed, the danger was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and the patient recovered. But in order to effect this, it was frequently ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to increaſe the quantity and number of the doſes; and, in ſeveral inſtances, I have puſhed it to an almoſt incredible length, with aſtoniſhing ſucceſs. In one caſe in particular, a gunner of the royal artillery, named Thomas Smith, in whom ſigns of recovery did not appear till the twenty-firſt day, fully 400 grains were given before the ſalivary glands were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>

For ſome time the queſtion reſpecting the propriety and impropriety of this practice was much agitated among my fellow-practitioners. The principal arguments of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered againſt it were founded on its no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty; its militating againſt the received theory of the nature of malignant and peſtilential fevers; and on the very limited duration of the diſeaſe, which, it was ſaid, did not admit the adminiſtration of a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity large enough to excite ſalivation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, even was mercury uſeful, time ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent was not given it to act. To theſe I had to obſerve, that the mere novelty of a practice was no ſufficient objection to it.<note n="19" place="bottom">It is a pity that Dr. Lind, on advancing the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing as a fact, did not give his authority; for no ſuch practice was ever known before the preſent period in theſe iſlands, nor in Jamaica; if we judge by the ſilence of medical practitioners of that iſland who have written.

Dr. Gilchriſt many years ago entertained the moſt decided opinion of the antiphlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtic virtues of this medicine.

III. p. 498.</note> In ſeveral inſtances of the malignant peſtilential fever I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved a fact, which is certainly curious, and ſtrongly illuſtrative of Dr. Gilchriſt's opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: In the low comatoſe ſtate, when the mercury already exhibited failed of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing ſalivation, and of courſe of effecting the change in the diſeaſe, which is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſigns of recovery; and, when the ſtomach was ſufficiently retentive, ſuch ſtimulus, or ſuch tone has been given by the
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:035302_0180_10021952355BB2D0"/>
bark, as enabled the former to act. The moment this was effected, ſigns of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very appeared. In very acute inflammations of the liver, I have a thouſand times ſeen, on the contrary, that the operation of the mercury is forwarded by diminiſhing the tone of the ſyſtem, by means of very liberal bleedings. A ſimilar effect to the former is alſo produced in ill-conditioned venereal ulcers, attended with hectic ſymptoms; the uſe of the bark gives much efficacy to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury; and indeed the latter, in theſe caſes, is ſeldom uſeful without the former. There is a ſingular obſervation of Dr. Huxham's on the low nervous fever, which may, I think, be brought forward here, as an analogical proof of the propriety of the practice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed: "There is no evacuation of a more favourable portent than a pretty <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

<pb n="166" facs="unknown:035302_0181_10021953E5138BF0"/>
ſurely ſufficient to juſtify even the <hi>empirical</hi> adminiſtration of mercury in the malignant peſtilential fever, as it appeared here; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the danger was ſo imminent, when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was not had to bold practice. The foregoing table will, I truſt, conſtitute a clear demonſtration of this. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore only add a few words on the cauſe of the ſucceſsful treatment of the ſick of the 45th regiment. I mentioned on a former occaſion, that the ſmall number of deaths in that regiment aroſe from the mode of treatment adopted by Mr. White, a very ingenious young gentleman, who attended the ſick in the abſence of the ſurgeon. The diſeaſe being new, its ſymptoms remarkably inſidious, and its fatal tendency very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common, Mr. White did me the honour to conſult me, and requeſt my opinion and advice. I mentioned to him the difficulties I had for ſome time laboured under, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of my obſervations, and the treatment I found alone uſeful in the more violent caſes; and recommended it to him as the moſt likely to be ſucceſsful among his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients. He immediately adopted it, and has ſince frequently declared to me, that
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:035302_0182_1002195791FC6A78"/>
he did not loſe afterwards one man, who had taken a ſufficient quantity of calomel to excite ſalivation. Mr. White and myſelf were ſtriking inſtances of the efficacy of the practice; we were both infected, were very dangerouſly ill, and cured by exciting ſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>By comparative want of ſucceſs in treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this dreadful malady with any other means than thoſe I have mentioned, might render any account of them unneceſſary. I ſhall, however, offer a few obſervations on the moſt remarkable of them, chiefly with a view to ſhow how inefficacious remedies ſtrongly recommended by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced and judicious writers in certain ſtates of the malignant fever, were found to be in the diſeaſe before us. When ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of local inflammation are ſo ſtrongly marked as they were in many of the more violent caſes of this diſeaſe, and in the low ſtate, in which the ſtrongeſt ſtimuli are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated, bliſters we ſhould expect would be pre-eminently uſeful. Dr. Lind in ſeveral places recommends bliſters as the moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual remedy in the early ſtages of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:035302_0183_1002195925947FA8"/>
and infectious fevers, and as often even preventing them. Nay, he goes ſo far as to conſider the effect of bliſters as the moſt certain proof of a prevailing infectious fever.<note n="24" place="bottom">Diſſertation on Fevers and Infection, ch. II. ſect. 1.</note> On the other hand, many, as Dr. Huxham, Sir John Pringle, Dr. D. Monro, M. Poiſſonnier, and Dr. Cullen, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend bliſters in the low ſtage only. The latter obſerves in general on this ſubject, that "bliſtering may be employed at any period of continued fevers; but that it will be of moſt advantage in the advanced ſtate of ſuch fevers, when the re-action being weaker, all ambiguity from the ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant power of bliſtering is removed, and when it may beſt concur with other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances tending to a final ſolution of the ſpaſm."<note n="25" place="bottom">Firſt lines, vol. I. p. 178.</note> In the preſent inſtance, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, bliſters were of little or no uſe at any period of the diſeaſe, or wherever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. In order to mitigate the intolerable violence of the headach, I have bliſtered the whole head, and the inſide of each thigh, at once, in ſeveral caſes, without producing
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:035302_0184_1002195B52FEB390"/>
the leaſt change in that or any other ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. I have had recourſe to this remedy to leſſen pain, to remove irritability of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and to raiſe the vital powers in the low comatoſe ſtage; but always, except in two caſes, without ſucceſs. In one of theſe, a ſoldier of the royal artillery, the irritabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the ſtomach was completely removed by a bliſter applied to the ſcrobiculus cordis. The other caſe was ſingular. In a tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the town of St. George, all the ſymptoms of the diſeaſe appeared, except the febrile heat. A bliſter was applied be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſhoulders, without adminiſtering any medicine previouſly, except the ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which operated very moderately. The effect was wonderful; the diſcharge was uncommonly large, black, and foetid in an intolerable degree; and the inſtant this took place the patient became better; and ſoon after, without the uſe of any other remedy, recovered. A medical gentleman of the army, at that time with the 67th regiment, informed me, that in his own caſe, as well as thoſe of four or five ſoldiers, he expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced extraordinary relief from the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a bliſter to the forepart of the
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:035302_0185_1002195FF95B8478"/>
head, or ſinciput. It is probable that the caſes of the diſeaſe he treated were leſs violent than moſt of thoſe which occurred in my practice; otherwiſe it is impoſſible to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for ſo great a difference of reſult in the ſame practice.</p>
            <p>From the hiſtory of the diſeaſe, it will not appear extraordinary that practitioners ſhould have recourſe to bark very early in it. The ſuddenneſs of the changes, and the apparent ſinking of the vital powers a few hours after the acceſſion of fever, naturally incline us to conſider it as a diſeaſe wherein tonics and antiſeptics, with the whole tribe of cordials, could be alone uſeful. But no indication can be more fallacious than this; and innumerable inſtances occurred of the fatal conſequence of adopting it. The uſe of the bark in the violent caſes of the malignant peſtilential fever, immediately after the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the evacuating medicines, was hurtful in the extreme; many continued the practice, notwithſtanding the glaring abſurdity as well as danger of it. But by way of removing ſpaſm, and obviating the tendency of the phlogiſtic ſymptoms, which
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:035302_0186_100219618FFB3B78"/>
they conſidered as unimportant, put in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with the expected putrefaction, they accompanied it with warm bathing, either partial or general, and occaſional purges. Their ſucceſs, as might be expected, was proportional to the unaptneſs of the means.</p>
            <p>In every caſe wherein ſalivation took place, little farther was required than the plentiful uſe of nouriſhing ſimple food, and wines. But when the mercury had not this effect, or when its action was ſo tardy as to give room for the moſt ſerious appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of the event, it was neceſſary to have recourſe to the bark. This medicine, in remittent bilious fevers, is ſeldom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commonly diſguſting to the patient; for although the ſtomach is very often irritable in theſe fevers, and conſequently incapable of retaining the bark, yet the patient ſeldom expreſſes any diſlike to ſwallowing it. In this fever, however, this medicine was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely diſagreeable to the patient, and the irritability of the ſtomach at the period when it became neceſſary was ſo great, as very frequently to baffle every attempt to
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:035302_0187_10021963251F5390"/>
render it retentive. Nature ſeemed to point out the impropriety of adminiſtering the bark, by not only rendering the palate ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrent to it, but exciting ſuch a degree of ſpaſm in the ſtomach, as made that organ totally unequal to even the reception of it. Hence we are not to be ſurpriſed that the bark did ſo little in this fever. In fact, except in the third, and part of the ſecond claſſes of patients, it was not a medicine to be depended on; and even in theſe, the ſucceſs was obtained chiefly by the agency of other medicines in reſtoring ſome degree of tone to the ſtomach. Opium, ſo often uſeful in other fevers, attended with irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability of the ſtomach, was in this ſeldom beneficial. Burnt ardent ſpirits ſeemed to give a momentary relief; but it was merely momentary. Nor had a repetition of them a ſimilar effect, for they were then inſtantly rejected. Bliſters, I have already obſerved, did almoſt no good in this way. Tincture of bark, or a very ſtrong infuſion of it in Port-wine, was ſometimes uſeful. But aether was the only medicine that was in any degree truly and permanently beneficial in enabling the ſtomach to receive and
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:035302_0188_100219659D099030"/>
retain the Peruvian bark. Many caſes fully evinced this; and a few occurred in my practice, wherein the cure was completed by this medicine alone. The only writer I have met with, who recommends the uſe of aether in malignant peſtilential fevers, is M. Poiſſonnier: "C'eſt dans ce <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

<pb n="174" facs="unknown:035302_0189_1002196892A64AC0"/>
to try it in a malady that had hitherto reſiſted all the means uſually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to. The event juſtified the practice. I gave the aether in the following man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The patient being allowed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main undiſturbed about an hour, I gave him about a tea-ſpoonful in about half a wine-glaſsfull of cool water. After this he continued undiſturbed about two hours, when the doſe was repeated. At the expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of another hour, the bark was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him; and if he ſwallowed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it, the aether afterwards was given only once in five or ſix hours. But as this very ſeldom happened, it was generally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to repeat the aether in the ſame quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity every three hours, till the ſpaſm of the ſtomach was entirely overcome. AEther, given in the manner I have mentioned, is extremely grateful to the patient; it occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions an agreeable warmth along the oeſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phagus, and gently ſtimulates the ſtomach. This effect, however, does not continue long; but the frequent production of it at length gives it permanency. It appears to act as a tonic, an antiſeptic, and an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſtimulant; a warm glow overſpreads
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:035302_0190_1002196BC105A478"/>
the ſurface, and thirſt, nauſea, and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion often have fled before it. I have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally during the exhibition of the aether, and till the ſtomach became retentive, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered bark to be adminiſtered in the form of injections.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to injections of bark in general, a great deal cannot be expected from them. In the diſeaſe before us, when the caſe was of the more violent kind, the ſpaſm which affected the ſtomach, prevailed more or leſs throughout the whole length of the inteſtinal canal; conſequently the injections were almoſt always immediately voided; or if they were retained, ſo little of the antiſeptic part of the medicine was abſorbed, as to be totally inadequate to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat the rapidly increaſing putreſcence. In a ſtate of the inteſtines ſo highly morbid, the action of the abſorbents muſt have been imperfect; or if, with Dr. Cullen, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the operation of bark as ariſing merely from a tonic power, the ſpaſmodic ſtate of the inteſtinal fibres muſt have prevented any efficacy from its application to them. But as the tonic power of this medicine
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:035302_0191_1002196DEF41F620"/>
could be alone efficacious, I did all in my power to obviate the ſpaſm, by antiſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modics, by diſtenſion of the fibres of the rectum and colon, and by the addition of Port-wine to the bark. The antiſpaſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dics I uſed were, opium in watery ſolution, aſafoetida, and camphor rendered ſoluble in water by mucilage; but I derived very little benefit from any of them. The moſt uſeful was the opium, of a ſtrong watery ſolution, of which I generally added two tea-ſpoonfuls to an injection compoſed of an ounce and an half of bark, and eight or ten ounces of water moderately warm, or of ſtrong chicken-broth or beef-tea. This injection was repeated, day and night, every three hours; and if uniformly retained, a laxative injection was adminiſtered once in the twenty-four hours to carry off the accumulated bark, which, otherwiſe, gave the patient conſiderable uneaſineſs. With a view to overcome the ſpaſm by diſtenſion, I had a pint and a half of the above mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture injected into the rectum, and ordered an aſſiſtant to compreſs the anus with ſome degree of violence, by means of a towel well rolled up, the inſtant the pipe of the
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:035302_0192_1002196FA21D8540"/>
ſyringe was withdrawn. This ſometimes ſucceeded, when the patient could be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on to lie quiet in one poſture; but in moſt caſes, the patient being comatoſe, delirious, or reſtleſs, from the general un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs and oppreſſion which then prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it could not be put in practice.<note n="27" place="bottom">In the very troubleſome ſpaſmodic affection of the ſtomach and oeſophagus, particularly the latter, called Hiccup, or Singultus, proceeding from irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities in diet, nothing ſooner or more effectually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves than diſtention of the oeſophagus by the detention of as large a quantity of very cold water, as poſſible, in that paſſage, for a minute or thirty ſeconds. This is eaſily effected by throwing the head back, and putting the muſcles of deglutition into action, in ſuch a manner as to compreſs the oeſophagus. I have often expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced the good effects of this operation; and it was this which firſt induced me to try the above practice.</note> The total inability of the ſtomach to receive either medicine or nouriſhment in many caſes; and the inefficacy of the bark in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections deſcribed, in obviating or correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the tendency to putreſcence, at length induced me to uſe Port-wine, as the moſt reſtringent, inſtead of the water, chicken-broth, or beef-tea. As the practice was not warranted by any medical authority, I
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:035302_0193_10021972C8EBBCB8"/>
confeſs it was after ſome heſitation I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured on it; and my heſitation aroſe chiefly from a fear of the irritation which the wine might occaſion when applied to the tender ſurface of the inteſtines; and, in a healthy ſtate, perhaps very untoward ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms might be the conſequence. But in the preſent morbid ſtate of theſe viſcera, ſo far from its producing irritation, I found it a moſt uſeful, and not unfrequently a very efficacious practice. To two ounces of bark, I added as much Port-wine as ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the mixture ſufficiently thin to paſs through the pipe of the ſyringe; and after adding the uſual proportion of the ſolution of opium, had it adminiſtered every three hours, taking care to uſe a conſiderable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of compreſſion on the anus for ſome time after, to prevent its being too ſoon paſſed. Although this medicine was by no means always effectual in ſtopping the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of putrefaction, yet it was infinitely more ſo than any other antiſeptic combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation uſed in this way, when the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach did not admit of the exhibition of bark in any other. Perſeverance, however, was abſolutely neceſſary in order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:035302_0194_100219751E223FA8"/>
the deſired effect; and it was alſo equally neceſſary to leave the ſtomach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturbed, as long as any irritation remained in it.</p>
            <p>Frequently baffled in my endeavours to fulfil the third indication of cure, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of the bark in the forms I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; and often induced from many of the ſymptoms, as well as the general cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the diſeaſe, to conſider it as a plague or peſtilence; I had, in a few caſes, recourſe to the practice deſcribed by Dr. Guthrie, and ſaid by him to be uncommonly ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful in the treatment of the plague by the Ruſſian phyſicians. I followed it exactly, with this exception only, that the dread of producing or increaſing irritability, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented me from repeating the emetics ſo frequently as recommended by the Ruſſian phyſicians. The reſult of this practice is laid down in the foregoing table, from which it appears, that as the number of unſucceſsful caſes was exactly equal to the recoveries, the encouragement to proceed was not very great. One of the patients treated in this way, Martin Gray, a ſoldier
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:035302_0195_1002197770B2CFE8"/>
of the royal artillery, had been apparently cured by mercury, without its producing ſalivation; but having relapſed, I put him on this courſe. After a flattering but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary change on the fifth, he died on the ſeventh day. Another of the ſame corps, Richard Ducket, had recovered in the ſame manner, by means of mercury, but relapſing, he was treated in this method, and recovered. This difference of reſult in circumſtances exactly parallel, muſt have ariſen from the former being a recruit juſt arrived from Europe; the latter, near three years in the climate.</p>
            <p>It may not, perhaps, be conſidered as foreign to my ſubject, to remark here, that in the furunculus, which prevailed very generally almoſt immediately after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant peſtilential fever had abated about the end of Auguſt or beginning of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, I found the combination of bark and ſulphur, which forms part of the above plan, a moſt excellent remedy in increaſing the eruption, and promoting the ſuppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Theſe furunculi, or as they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called, Blind-boils, were very large,
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:035302_0196_10021979D4044480"/>
ſeldom leſs than an inch in diameter, very painful, and diſcharged a very uncommon quantity of purulent matter, frequently mixed with ichor. They appeared on every part of the body; but in greateſt number near the ſcrotum, the hips, and on both upper and lower extremities.</p>
            <p>Wiſhing to leave nothing untried that promiſed any relief to my patients in this fatal malady, I determined on trying what the Anguſtura bark would do. On a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer occaſion, this bark ſeemed uſeful in an irregular fever depending on local diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. Since then, I have read Mr. Brand's "Experiments and Obſervations on the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtura Bark," wherein its efficacy, as an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſeptic and tonic, are highly commended in various ſtates of fever. Encouraged by theſe, and perceiving that this bark poſſeſſed a pungency or ſpicy taſte, a quality which the Peruvian bark had in a very inferior degree, I made uſe of it, in expectation that by gently ſtimulating the ſtomach, and thereby obviating the ſpaſm with which that organ was affected, it might have a better chance of being retained. I did
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:035302_0197_1002197B682BB8D0"/>
not begin to uſe this medicine till towards the end of July, and gave it in only twelve caſes. Five of theſe were ſoldiers of the royal artillery; and the remaining ſeven, inhabitants and tranſient people. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer recovered with remarkable rapidity, and three of the latter; ſo that only one in three died. Although this ſucceſs was greater than I expected, I did not think myſelf juſtifiable in truſting altogether to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtura bark, when I was poſſeſſed of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy more certain in its effect, and of whoſe ſafety extenſive experience had fully ſatisfied me. From the event, however, it was evidently a more ſuitable medicine than the Peruvian bark. Three of the five of the artillery, who took the Anguſtura bark were young men, who had never entered the torrid zone before, and were almoſt total ſtrangers to the climate; and thoſe who died were ſailors, who had only lately arrived from Europe. It was evident there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that although frequently an uſeful medicine, and although it generally agreed with the ſtomach, it was by no means to be ſafely depended on in caſes of great violence. I always preceded the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:035302_0198_100219509F74FE68"/>
of this medicine with the deob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruents and diaphoretics I have already mentioned; and after the operation of theſe, I gave a ſcruple of the powder of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtura bark mixed with water, every hour, or two ſcruples in three hours. In the eight caſes wherein this practice was ſucceſsful, I was aſtoniſhed to ſee an almoſt immediate change take place; for inſtead of the heat being increaſed, and the ſurface becoming dry, which too often followed the too early uſe of the Peruvian bark, an agreeable glow, an increaſe of warm ſweat, and a diminution of pain were the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. For inſtance, if the patient was ſeized with the uſual ſymptoms on the evening, I had immediately the vomit ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered, and repeated if neceſſary; this was followed up, as ſoon as poſſible, by the cooling diaphoretic, or with the ſaline draughts, with a ſufficient addition of the bitter cathartic ſalts; or inſtead of all theſe, the ſolution of ſalts and tartariſed antimony, in the manner already deſcribed. Theſe having operated ſufficiently during the night, I began the uſe of the Anguſtura bark in the morning. By the following evening,
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:035302_0199_1002197FE5B7BF18"/>
all the ſymptoms were relieved; and on the ſecond morning, the patient was up, walked a little, and had ſome appetite; and from that time, uſing occaſionally the Anguſtura bark, he continued to recover. How dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent this from the effect of the Peruvian bark; nauſea, vomiting, heat, dry ſkin, quickened pulſe, increaſed pain; often ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by coma, delirium, &amp;c. and ſeldom adminiſtrable without aether. Upon the whole it appeared, that the inefficacy of the Anguſtura bark in the more violent caſes, aroſe from the irritability of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach being greater, and leſs tractable in them; and from an inſufficiency of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſeptic power in the bark itſelf.<note n="28" place="bottom">From ſome experiments I made, after the above ſucceſsful exhibition of the Anguſtura bark in the malignant peſtilential fever, with a view to diſcover to what particular qualities it poſſeſſed, this ſucceſs was to be attributed, I was induced to refer it to an uncommon quantity of fixed air or aerial acid, and to a volatile alkali which this bark appeared to contain. As however experiments of this kind are often ſubject to deception, I ſhall not take upon me to ſpeak with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty on the ſubject. But in order that the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I allude to may be repeated by thoſe more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced in this way than I am, I ſhall inſert them here. "In order to diſcover whether this infuſion, made of one ounce of the powder of Anguſtura bark in eight ounces of water, contained any fixed air or aerial acid, I added to one ounce of it filtered, a ſmall quantity of filtered lime-water. The infuſion became immediately turbid, and of a dirty yellow colour approaching to white, and depoſited ſoon after, on the ſides and bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the glaſs, a ſmall quantity of a greyiſh-white powder. The infuſion, after the powder ſubſided com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely, was perfectly tranſparent, and of a beautiful amber-colour." "To two ounces of the infuſion, I added a ſmall quantity of a watery ſolution of corroſive ſublimate. The mixture became inſtantly whitiſh, which, no doubt, had the colouring matter of the bark been wanting, would have been milky; a whitiſh powder was ſoon after precipitated." The infuſion of pale Peruvian bark ſuffered no change on the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of lime-water; but with the addition of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery ſolution of corroſive ſublimate, it became inſtantly whitiſh, and a precipitation of a whitiſh powder took place. The antiſeptic power of this medicine in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion is evidently extremely weak, but not ſo in powder; thus, the infuſion with freſh meat becomes highly offenſive in thirty hours, in the common tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of the air; that is, in a heat at an average about 83 degrees of Farenheit; but a piece of meat of equal weight, <abbr>viz.</abbr> two drams, well rubbed with the powder and wrapped in a piece of paper, placed in the ſame heat, was perfectly ſweet at the end of ten days, no other ſmell being perceptible but that of the bark. Does this corroborate the reſult of the above experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? And is not the remarkable efficacy of this medicine in dyſentery, which I have frequently expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced, to be attributed to the powers aſcribed to it here? For the above teſts, ſee Bergman's <hi>Phyſical and Chymical Eſſays,</hi> Cullen's Tranſlation, vol. I. p. 32, &amp;c. though, as they are applied in the preceding experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, may be fallacious.</note>

Having thus offered the moſt important obſervations I made in endeavouring to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:035302_0201_10021983A36EFBE0"/>
the three firſt indications of cure of the malignant peſtilential fever, I ſhall now treat of the fourth, <abbr>viz.</abbr> to reſtore tone and ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy to the ſyſtem when the patient was in a ſtate of recovery. Change of air and ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diet were the means I found moſt uſeful; for, contrary to moſt febrile diſeaſes, bark was here either uſeleſs or hurtful; and, as I have already remarked, the patient ſeemed inſtinctively to reject and loath it.</p>
            <p>As long as the patient remained in the infected room or houſe, although all ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of the diſeaſe had diſappeared, the progreſs of his recovery was remarkably flow. And here I may alſo obſerve, that his reſtoration to health ſeemed to bear a pretty exact proportion to the means uſed in overcoming the diſeaſe. Headach, a heavy dull eye, with a conſiderable protru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:035302_0202_1002198538B6AD40"/>
from the orbits, low ſpirits, thirſt, and a total want of appetite, were the general conſequences of the treatment with bark, without the previous uſe of deobſtruents, and the appropriate antiphlogiſtic. None of theſe unpleaſant feelings attended con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valeſcence, when the diſeaſe had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by mercurials; and I had frequently reaſon to imagine, that a ſerous accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation continued in the brain a conſiderable time after the diſappearance of the diſeaſe, when treated in the former way. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion indeed was evidently indicated by the appearance of the eyes, the continual headach, a frequent nauſea, and a tendency to ſtupor and ſleepineſs; and as no means were uſed during the exiſtence of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe to excite an abſorption of the exhaled fluid in the brain, it was highly probable that the compreſſion aroſe from this defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency. Although nothing of this kind fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the mercurial plan, extreme debility was the immediate conſequence of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe in all caſes. But there was always this diſtinction obſervable, that convaleſcent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility was of much ſhorter duration after treatment with mercury than the other.
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:035302_0203_10021987659B8C58"/>
It appeared that the infected air of the room in which the patient continued to reſide, although it could never renew the diſeaſe, ſtimulated the ſtomach in ſuch a manner as to produce an effect almoſt equally dreadful. To obviate this evil, a change of air and ſituation became abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary the moment ſigns of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valeſcence appeared; and indeed, of all the means I know for recovery from this ſtate of debility, it is the moſt efficacious. Even the inſtant the patient was carried into the open air, he was ſenſible of a wonderful degree of refreſhment; and the purer the atmoſphere, and the higher the ſituation of the place, provided there was no dampneſs, the ſpeedier was his acquiſition of ſtrength. The inſtances of this were innumerable; as were likewiſe thoſe of a contrary treatment. The 45th regiment afforded one of the moſt remarkable of the former. The ſick ſoldiers, as ſoon as they were able to bear any degree of motion, were ſent to Hoſpital-hill, where they were kept till they acquired their uſual health; which happened in a ſurpriſingly ſhort time. The diſtance from Fort George, where the regiment was ſtationed, to the
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:035302_0204_1002198A33543A70"/>
barracks on Hoſpital-hill, is fully a mile; and the aſcent for the moſt part is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable. Although the ſick, at the time they began their walk, or ride, from the Fort were apparently ſo weak and languid as to be ſcarce able to bear exerciſe, before they reached their barracks, inſtead of being overcome with fatigue, they were ſenſibly better and ſtronger. The change to a purer air, a high rocky ſituation, abundance of good water, and the diſtance from infection, produced an alteration in a few days; and this was rendered ſtill more remarkable, by their accommodation being cold and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the weather; for the barracks in which they were lodged, were ſo much decayed as to admit the rain and wind al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every-where. Under circumſtances which did not admit of changes of this nature, much benefit to the patient accrued from the moving him from the infected chamber to one adjoining. In the hoſpitals this was frequently done, and always with the beſt conſequences. I have even ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended this removal to that ſtate of the diſeaſe which immediately ſucceeds the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory, and frequently with evident
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:035302_0205_1002198BCBF733B0"/>
advantage; nor is it to be wondered at, ſince it is eaſy to conceive that the violence of a contagious diſeaſe will increaſe in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the accumulation of infection in the atmoſphere immediately ſurrounding the perſon afflicted with it. Something of this kind was done on ſhip-board, where the accommodation was in general wretchedly bad and confined. In a few of the ſhips, the captains had the humanity to give up their cabins altogether to the ſick; and in theſe, the ſick enjoying ſufficient room, good air, and better ventilation than between decks, the mortality was infinitely leſs. As I conſidered cleanlineſs and free venti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation as two principal agents in deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contagion, I always enjoined particular attention to them: where theſe were more immediately in my own power, nothing was left undone to effect them. In the royal artillery hoſpital, when the diſeaſe was almoſt at its height of violence, I had all the wards ſucceſſively white-waſhed; in doing which I effected another object, the removal of the ſick from the infected wards to others that were not ſo. After each ward was white-waſhed, I had ſeveral
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:035302_0206_1002198D60C57338"/>
port-fires<note n="29" place="bottom">Port-fire is a compoſition of two-fourths of ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, one-fourth of nitre, and one-fourth of meal or powder of charcoal, rammed into paper tubes two feet long, uſed in firing off cannon, mortars, and other pieces of ordnance, in lieu of ſlow-match, formerly uſed.</note> burnt in it, and the ſmoke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined for ſeveral hours; and afterwards well waſhed with hot vinegar. Twice or thrice in the week, moiſtened gunpowder was burnt in each ward; and thrice in the day, the floors and bedſteads of the ſick were ſprinkled with vinegar. But in order to deſtroy the ſeeds of infection as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely as poſſible, all the blankets, ſhirts, flannel jackets and waiſtcoats of thoſe who died, were burnt immediately after their death; and the bodies carried to a dead-houſe, ſome yards diſtant from the hoſpital. Sheets, ſhirts, and other wearing-apparel of thoſe who recovered, were firſt well fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migated with gunpowder, and afterwards waſhed, before the patient was diſcharged. The captains of ſome of the London mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantmen, had the hold and lower decks daily well fumigated with moiſtened gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, during which the hatches were
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:035302_0207_1002198F979C5F60"/>
kept cloſe ſhut. All the under-decks were alſo frequently waſhed with hot vinegar; and fires were occaſionally lighted below. The beneficial conſequences of this atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were remarkably conſpicuous; their men recovered their ſtrength ſurpriſingly faſt, and ſuffered no relapſe; and new men who were taken on board to replace thoſe who fell victims to the diſeaſe, continued well and untainted. It was otherwiſe with ſhips on board of which theſe precautions were not obſerved; relapſes, or rather a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of the diſeaſe, were not uncommon, and new men became immediately infected. On the 19th of May, a letter of marque belonging to Liverpool, brought into St. George's the crew, thirty in number, of a French veſſel ſhe had captured on her paſſage from England. Theſe, on account of the ſcarcity of ſeamen, were diſtributed among the merchant-men moſt in want. Many of theſe people were immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and died; and it is remarkable, that the lot of theſe unfortunate men was to be put on board the leaſt cleanly, and of courſe the moſt infected ſhips.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="193" facs="unknown:035302_0208_100219925DC84098"/>
Suitable diet was the next means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring tone and energy to the ſyſtem. During the exiſtence of the diſeaſe, it was of little importance whether the patient took nouriſhment or not; and indeed, from the circumſtances under which the ſick ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally laboured, it is evident that nothing material in this way could be adminiſtered. It was otherwiſe, however, the moment ſigns of recovery took place: the great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject was to ſelect ſuch articles of food as were moſt palatable, moſt ſimple, moſt nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing, and of ſmalleſt bulk; for nauſea was readily excited, the general debility was very great, and the digeſtive powers were very imperfect. Moſt liquid aliment, eſpecially ſoups, were extremely diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and readily excited nauſea; meats were ſometimes acceptable, but very few were admiſſible. Sago, panada, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations of the Indian arrow-root,<note n="30" place="bottom">Maranta Galanga, Linnaei.</note> with a large proportion of Madeira wine, well ſpiced, were by far the moſt agreeable, the lighteſt, and moſt nouriſhing. To theſe therefore, with occaſionally the addition
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:035302_0209_10021993F21E0460"/>
of a ſoft freſh egg, I confined my convaleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents; and I regulated the manner and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency of giving them, by the rule laid down by Celſus. "Cibus non multus qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem, ſed saepe tamen nocte ac die dandus eſt; ut nutriat neque oneret."<note n="31" place="bottom">Lib. III. cap. 19.</note> It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, and totally contrary to what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens during convaleſcence from other fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, that wine in general was extremely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to the patients; and it was with much perſuaſion and difficulty they could be prevailed on to uſe it. Madeira and the richer ſweet wines were the moſt unpala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; Hock and Rheniſh wine were often taken with pleaſure; but Port-wine was the leaſt unpleaſant of any. All convaleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents were uncommonly fond of porter and ſmall beer; and, when permitted, greedily ſwallowed large draughts of them. As they always agreed well with the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and as it was of the utmoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to pleaſe wherein it could be done without injury, I generally indulged them in the liberal uſe of theſe liquors.
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:035302_0210_10021995B4CDCE98"/>
Riding, and moderate exerciſe of any kind, contributed very much to the reſtoration of health.</p>
            <p>In ſome, whoſe viſcera became perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently diſeaſed from improper treatment or imprudence, hectic heats and colliqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſweats and diarrhoeas took place. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of theſe who could not change the climate, fell victims to this ſequela of the malignant peſtilential fever. Milk diet, country air, and cheerful ſociety, had ſome effect in relieving theſe patients; but a northern climate was always the laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource, where it could be obtained.</p>
            <p>Before I conclude this part of the taſk I have impoſed on myſelf, I cannot help obſerving, that as the majority of the moſt uſeful part of ſociety are daily expoſed to the ravages of one of the moſt deſtructive calamities mankind are ſubject to, we have reaſon to conſider ourſelves as extremely fortunate in poſſeſſing a remedy which, under certain circumſtances, may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on in the cure of it. There is, no doubt, the influence of old habits, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical

authority to be combatted, ere the practice I have recommended can be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally adopted; but it is to be hoped that theſe will yield to facts and experience, the phyſician's only certain guides in the treatment of diſeaſe. Little encouragement is held out by the reſult of the practice hitherto generally reſorted to in malignant and peſtilential fevers; but, authoriſed by men highly eminent in their profeſſion, it has become a kind of falſe beacon, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the young and unexperienced to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures full of inconceivable miſchief. An inſtance will illuſtrate this: Dr. Schotte, in his very ingenious Treatiſe on a Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Fever which raged fatally at Senegal, obſerves, that "he did not think himſelf very blameable in not adminiſtering lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num ſooner; for what can a young practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner do better, than follow the rules and precepts laid down by celebrated clinical authors?"—"Opium I was prevented from giving, by thoſe cautions which are met with in the writings of many eminent authors, as preventing nature in its opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and putting a ſtop to its ſalutary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions."

               <note n="32" place="bottom">Treatiſe on the Synochus Atrabilioſa, p. 139, 140.</note> How much is it to be regretted that Dr. Schotte ſhould in ſo melancholy an extremity forget that he practiſed in the torrid zone, where cautions neceſſary, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, in London and its neighbourhood, are not admiſſible! How much miſchief might have been prevented, had his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment been unſhackled: had he boldly, on an occaſion which demanded new and deciſive meaſures, thought for himſelf: had he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigated more fully, more eſpecially by diſſection, the nature of the diſeaſe he treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: had he known, or adverted to the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlogiſtic virtues of mercury, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite advantage ariſing from the promoting of abſorption in a diſeaſe ſo evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on local derangement. As a phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician offers himſelf to the public as the declared enemy of diſeaſe, in every form it may aſſume; as he conſequently pledges himſelf to leave nought undone which he knows can, or which promiſes to be uſeful towards the obtainment of the object in view, is it not incumbent on him, as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liminary ſtep, by every poſſible means to

diſcover the nature of the malady he is to combat with; and even ſhould there be danger in the attempt, does it not diſplay a moſt unpardonable timidity, a medical lachété ſtamped with characters uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly prominent, ſhould he ſhrink from it when life or death is the object to be obtained, by a little exertion of fortitude? "It is a phyſician's duty to do every thing in his power, that is not criminal, to ſave the life of his patient."<note n="33" place="bottom">Lectures on the Duties and Qualifications of a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, p. 39.</note> And, to uſe a plain and rather trite ſimile, an able phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, like a ſkilful general, ſhould inform himſelf fully of the number, the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds, the advantageous poſitions, the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable points of the enemy, before he ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly attacks.

            <p>It may be expected from the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties I had, not only of ſeeing the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant peſtilential fever in all its various de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of violence, but alſo of inveſtigating the cauſe which might produce and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote it; that uſeful information may be the reſult of my obſervations with reſpect to the means of prevention. The impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of an inquiry of this nature is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, and perhaps in the torrid zone, of more than in any other; becauſe in it the agency of cold can never interpoſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the ravages of a peſtilential diſeaſe; nor is there ever obſerved that degree of heat which deſtroys peſtilential infection in the warmer regions of the old continent.

Some late travellers obſerving more accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, or poſſeſſing means more adequate to the inveſtigation of truth than their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, have thrown much light on the cauſes and ſource of peſtilence. The Baron de Tott, who we have reaſon to believe had the beſt means of information, ſays, that the plague would be unknown in Egypt, were it not for the contagion which is introduced by the trading veſſels from Conſtantinople; that it is in Alexandria it firſt manifeſts itſelf; that it rarely reaches Cairo, although no precautions are uſed to prevent it: "oû les chaleurs la font bien-tôt ceſſer, et l'empechent de penetrer juſques dans le Saïde."<note n="35" place="bottom">Memoirs du Baron de Tott ſur les Tures et les Tartares, tom. IV. p. 57.</note> M. Savary, who reſided a conſiderable time in Egypt, obſerves in his forty-fourth letter, that Smyrna and Conſtantinople are the foci of this frightful malady; from whence it is always imported into Egypt, which, otherwiſe would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from it. He adds, "Another remark, deſerving our particular attention, is, that the extremes of heat and cold are alike
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:035302_0216_100219A2EF8F4EE8"/>
enemies to this terrible contagion. The winter puts an end to it at Conſtantinople; the ſummer deſtroys it in Egypt. It ſcarcely ever reaches the polar circle, and <hi>never paſſes the tropic.</hi>"<note n="36" place="bottom">The laſt part of M. Savary's remark does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be now altogether well-founded, ſince we may certainly conſider the diſeaſe, which is the only ſubject of theſe ſheets, as a plague modified by the uniform heat of the climate into which it has been introduced. Does not the ceaſing of this diſeaſe at Philadelphia at the commencement of winter, conſtitute a proof of this: Some objections may ariſe from its being conſidered as doubtful, whether the diſeaſe which raged here was the ſame as that which proved ſo fatal in Philadelphia? That they were the ſame, the following fact renders evident: A veſſel belonging to Philadelphia introduced the diſeaſe into St. Pierre, Martinique, in October, 1793. Another veſſel from New London touched at St. Pierre, in her way to Grenada, and received the infection. On her arrival, in February, 1794, the ſick were put under my charge; and I found the diſeaſe to be my old enemy, the malignant peſtilential fever. I treated it with mercury, and was ſucceſsful.</note> The original cauſes of plague, and all its modifications, are unqueſtionably accumulated human effluvia in cloſe hot rooms, filth, and the hoarding up of woollen clothes and bedding uſed by infected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. All writers agree in this; and the obſervations of Dr. Guthrie have thrown
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:035302_0217_100219A4873DE1C0"/>
much light on the manner in which theſe cauſes act to produce ſo dreadful an effect. Baron de Tott has given the public a moſt important obſervation with reſpect to the manner in which the plague is propagated at Conſtantinople: "Qui qu'il en ſoit ii n'y a point d'incertitude ſur le foyer qui la conſerve, ni ſur les cauſes que la propagent. On retrouve l'un et l'autre, chez les mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chands fripiers de Conſtantinople, et chez les particuliers qui conſervent dans leurs coffres tous les vêtements, les fourures mêmes des perſonnes mortes de la peſte. C'eſt ſans doute prendre le moyen le plus efficace pour en fomenter et en perpètuer le germe," &amp;c. This obſervation was fully illuſtrated by the conduct of individuals in the lower claſſes of the inhabitants of this town. Many of theſe derive their ſubſiſtence from retailing rum of the cheapeſt and worſt quality to ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, ſoldiers, and ſailor and porter negroes; and as the detection of this practice, which is not permitted by law, might be deſtructive to their views, and ruinous to their little ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals, they carry it on in booths, and ſmall wooden buildings of little value, erected near the wharfs, or under the ſhelter of large
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:035302_0218_100219A61D85DC80"/>
houſes, or in lanes and places out of public notice: to theſe, perſons of the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I have mentioned are encouraged to reſort, where they ſoon become intoxicated, and are crowded together in a hot, putrid, or infected atmoſphere, till they recover their ſenſes; when they generally find themſelves precipitated into a fever of a moſt malignant character. Into theſe ſinks of peſtilence and deſtructive diſſipation, captains of veſſels, during the prevalence of the malignant peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilential fever, induced by the apparent cheapneſs of the accommodation, hurried their wretched ſailors labouring under the diſeaſe in its worſt form. The moment they entered them, their fate was generally decided, ſince the beſt digeſted plan of cure, and the moſt appropriate remedies could not overcome a diſeaſe whoſe violence was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually accumulating by the ſurrounding infection. But the evil did not ceaſe with their lives; their mattreſſes, blankets, and wearing apparel, wretched as they were, became an object of value in the eyes of theſe inſidious plunderers; and whether they were hoarded up in theſe places, or diſpoſed of to others, ſtill being preſerved,
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:035302_0219_100219A85A15DB40"/>
they became the ſeminium of the diſeaſe, and were the principal means of propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating it. Another cauſe contributed not a little to ſupport the contagion: From the indolence peculiar to all claſſes of people in this climate, and from the novelty of the thing itſelf, few paid the neceſſary attention to ſweetening and ventilating the rooms of the ſick when the diſeaſe ceaſed; from this it frequently happened that a healthy perſon on entering any of theſe infected rooms, was inſtantly ſtruck with the infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Theſe facts demonſtrate, that means are always in the power of the inhabitants of the torrid zone to check or prevent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion. That the diſeaſe therefore might have been prevented in the firſt inſtance, and that the propagation of it afterwards might have been confined to thoſe places which firſt received the infection, is certain, had the nature of it been properly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and had laws which oblige the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of quarantine been in exiſtence, But much, very much depends on indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual prudence, as well as public policy; and it is to be feared that plans of preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, however well adapted they may be
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:035302_0220_100219AB1C7C6390"/>
to the local ſituation and other circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the caſe, will always prove abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in the Weſt India colonies, from a conſtitutional want of energy in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive government; from a kind of defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency in the public ſpirit of individuals; and becauſe, as Mitio in the play obſerves,

            <p>A general plan of prevention has, in theſe colonies (particularly Grenada) for its objects, the deſtruction of all ſmall wooden buildings erected purpoſely for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation of the loweſt claſs of white people, and free people of colour; who, renting them with no other view than to retail rum of the worſt quality, and to harbour poor tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient perſons, in order to deſpoil them of their ſcanty property, become the greateſt nuiſance in Weſt India towns, and literally the peſt of ſociety. The obliging the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants to build with ſtone or brick, and to lay out the plan of their buildings in ſuch a manner that the ſtreets may be ſpacious,
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:035302_0221_100219ACB021EE10"/>
and ſubject to the perflation of the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing winds; the rooms as large as the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral dimenſions of the houſe will permit; ſtables, neceſſaries, and all other erections of that kind, at a diſtance from the dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſe, not leſs than twenty feet; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain places built at individual or general expence, to which all filth ſhall be early in the morning carried; from whence, at ſtated times, proper perſons paid by the public ſhall carry it to a diſtance from town. The obliging butchers to ſlaughter in places ſo far diſtant from town, and ſo ſituated as not to affect the atmoſphere with the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive foetor ariſing from offals and putrid meat; and proper ſheds or ſtalls well ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilated, and as near running water as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to be built at the expence of the public, to which butchers and all others who ſlaughter meat for ſale, ſhall be obliged to carry their meat at certain ſtated hours, which ſhould be as early in the morning as poſſible. The appropriating a certain por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ground for the burying of the dead, at ſome diſtance from town, and to incloſe it with a ſtone wall. The enacting of a law which ſhall involve in it the foregoing
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:035302_0222_100219AE6F245430"/>
objects the prohibiting the retail of rum, except under certain limitations: the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing of proper perſons with adequate ſalaries, to be denominated officers of health; the duty of a certain number of whom, ſhall be the preventing the erection of buildings of the deſcription mentioned: the regulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the licenſed rum ſtores: the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intending the general regulations relative to cleanlineſs, ventilation of ſtreets and houſes, butchers ſtalls, and ſlaughter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, burying-grounds, &amp;c. and prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the landing and lodging of any infected perſon or thing, or any perſon or thing ſuſpected of being ſo. This law ſhould au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize the remainder of the officers of health thus appointed, to viſit all ſhips which ſhall carry on trade with the iſland, and after aſcertaining their health, or the exiſtence of a contagious diſeaſe on board, or which had lately prevailed on board, to permit them to enter the harbour, and land their cargoes or to oblige them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to a place appointed for the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of quarantine. Proper places for this purpoſe muſt be choſen, on which lazaret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes or peſt-houſes, and ſtores or ſheds ſhall
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:035302_0223_100219B15F998210"/>
be erected, in which the crews and goods on board ſhall be lodged and purified by the means ſo copiouſly treated of by Dr. Mead, Dr. Lind, and others. After remaining there a term of days, not exceeding fourteen, the officers of health ſhall grant their cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate of the healthy ſtate of the crew, and purification of the goods: on which, the veſſels ſhall be permitted to enter the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and land their cargoes. Authority ſhould alſo be veſted in theſe officers of health, ſubject however to the controul of magiſtrates or juſtices of the peace, to fine or inflict ſuch other puniſhment as delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, in any of the caſes ſpecified, ſhall be judged deſerving of. And in order to give more efficacy to theſe regulations, perhaps it would be a wiſe meaſure in the legiſlature, if they are conſtitutionally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent to it, to enlarge the powers of the governor in ſuch a manner as may enable him to act with energy on ſuch occaſions as theſe, and prevent the repetition of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquency, by inflicting puniſhment in a more ſummary way than he can at preſent. The obtaining theſe improvements in the police of Weſt India towns, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:035302_0224_100219B38ECD3AF8"/>
obedience to theſe regulations, muſt altogether depend on the public; and it is to be preſumed, that the great importance of their object will be a powerful ſtimulus to the legiſlative body, in enacting with all due ſpeed the neceſſary laws for the effectual eſtabliſhment of them.</p>
            <p>The means of prevention which more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately depend on the prudence and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion of individuals, have been ſo often and ſo ably ſtated by writers on this ſubject, as to render it unneceſſary for me to enlarge on them here. When an individual of a family has been ſeized with a contagious or peſtilential fever, care ſhould be taken to prevent all, except thoſe who are neceſſary in attending him, from going into the room in which he is confined; if he recovers, the bed-clothes and wearing apparel which he uſed during his illneſs, ſhould be as ſoon as poſſible deſtroyed by fire; his perſon well waſhed, and dreſſed with clothes that cannot be ſubject to ſuſpicion; he ſhould be carried into the country, if poſſible, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in it till he acquires his uſual degree of ſtrength: the room he lay in ſhould be
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:035302_0225_100219B5230A13D8"/>
new painted if wainſcotted, or white-waſhed if otherwiſe; and the floor and ceiling, doors, window-ſhutters, &amp;c. ſhould be well ſcrubbed, and the whole afterwards fumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated with moiſtened gunpowder; the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, before they again mix with ſociety, ſhould be obliged to purify their perſons, and change their clothes. When the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe appears on ſhip-board, the ſick ſhould be inſtantly ſeparated from the healthy, and carried to a place on ſhore, from which the infection cannot ſpread; the ſpace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween decks, the hold, the cabin, ſhould be immediately well ſcrubbed, and, if it can be done, white-waſhed; fires ſhould be lighted in the hold and between decks, and whilſt they are burning, the hatches ſhould be kept cloſe ſhut; and the whole for ſeveral days ſhould be carefully fumigated and ſprinkled with vinegar. But as the hammocks and mattreſſes of ſeamen are more ſubject to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and retain infection than any thing elſe on board, the greateſt care ſhould be taken to waſh them well; and if any have been uſed by the ſick, to burn them. A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable inſtance of the efficacy of theſe means of prevention on ſhip-board, I have
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:035302_0226_100219B6B8A2BBC8"/>
at preſent (February 20th, 1794) before me. The ſhip Mary of Liverpool, of 26 guns and 70 men, received the infection either from an American veſſel, the crew of which had been infected at Martinique, or from the rum-ſhops I have already deſcribed. I adviſed the captain to ſeparate the ſick from the healthy, and if poſſible to ſend them on ſhore; and afterwards to waſh all the decks well with vinegar, to light fires be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween decks and in the hold, and to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migate the whole with gunpowder. He complied with my directions, and the reſult has been moſt happy; for after the four in whom the diſeaſe appeared were ſent on ſhore, and the means I have mentioned were uſed, the diſeaſe entirely ceaſed to ſpread. I may obſerve here, that ſome of the methods recommended in Europe for preventing the ſpreading of a contagious diſeaſe, are not always neceſſary, the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate itſelf in ſome circumſtances doing what in Europe, particularly in Great Britain, muſt be done by artificial means. I ſhall only mention two inſtances. It is by no means neceſſary, or rather it is augmenting the virulence of the contagion, to ſhut up
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:035302_0227_100219B8EB7BB2D8"/>
families in their houſes, when an individual of it has been ſeized with the diſeaſe. I have already obſerved, that the ſphere of infectious atmoſphere in this climate, has in no inſtance exceeded ten feet; and that all beyond that, have remained untaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It therefore is evident, that a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of this kind would not only be unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, but extremely hurtful; for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined air in the torrid zone, becomes in a very ſhort time totally unfit for reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, however large the rooms may be: a proof of which is the oppreſſion and other uneaſy ſymptoms a perſon is ſenſible of in a room, the doors and windows of which are cloſe ſhut. For the ſame reaſon, what has been propoſed by Dr. Lind, if executed in this climate, would produce an effect in every reſpect reverſe of that which that ingenious and experienced phyſician ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from it. His propoſal is, that "the diſperſed ſick ſhould be carefully collected into one place, and the houſes be purified on their removal; as others are taken ill, they ſhould alſo be immediately put with the ſick, and in a ſhort time, the infection
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:035302_0228_100219BBAAF7F830"/>
will be wholly confined to one ſpot."<note n="37" place="bottom">Dr. Lind's Eſſays, p. 350.</note> In a climate whoſe temperature generally varies little, any thing like crowding patients, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring under the action of peſtilential contagion, muſt appear, prima faciê, in the higheſt degree improper. It is therefore hoſpitals, unleſs they have been conſtructed on a very large ſcale, that have always been hurtful. On every account, ſeparate rooms are better, were they even huts, providing due care is taken to ventilate them properly, and keep them clean. A ſtriking illuſtration of this is, what happened in the royal ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery hoſpital of this iſland, already related; and it is the more deſerving of attention, as the hoſpital is a ſtone building, ſituated in the moſt favourable ſituation poſſible for ventilation; as the rooms are large, lofty, and well perflated in every direction; and as every thing is kept remarkably clean and ſweet.</p>
            <p>Thoſe whoſe buſineſs or duty lead them to the chambers of the ſick, ſhould be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly careful to avoid entering them with
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:035302_0229_100219BD438B41D0"/>
an empty ſtomach; or when they are heated; or when they are in perſpiration. The laſt caution is more particularly to be attended to, as the pores of the ſkin in that ſtate, may be conſidered as ſo many open mouths ready to receive and ſwallow the infectious effluvia; which no poſſible means can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. The uſual manner of uſing the aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic gums, or keeping camphorated or aromatic vinegar to the noſe, or ſuſpending ſmall bags of camphor, muſk, aſafoetida, &amp;c. on the breaſt, as I have already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, have not the ſmalleſt efficacy in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting infection when the body is expoſed to it. But as it is evident that the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious effluvia do not extend themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond a limited diſtance from the infected perſon, ſo the beſt preventive muſt of courſe be the taking care not to go nearer the ſick, if poſſible, than the limits of the infected at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere. The duty, however, of phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, nurſes, and other neceſſary attendants, muſt render their obſerving that precaution impoſſible; they muſt therefore truſt more to their temperance than prophylactics of this kind for exemption from infection. One caution, however, may be uſeful even
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:035302_0230_100219BF114883C8"/>
to them, if ſtrictly obſerved. It is probable that the matter of contagion enters the body more readily by the lungs and ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, than by the ſkin; conſequently, if care be taken to keep the mouth and noſtrils ſhut during the examination of the patient or the more immediate attendance on his perſon, by means of handkerchiefs ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with any antiſeptic fluid, particularly camphorated vinegar, or the little balls re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by Dr. Lind, there will be leſs riſk of their receiving the infection. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I have little faith in amulets, and indeed none of the tribe recurred to here were uſeful during the prevalence of the malignant peſtilential fever, perhaps the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular one mentioned by Dr. Lind, may be employed on theſe occaſions with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. I mean the quill filled with quick-ſilver, and corked at each end, carried in a pocket near the groin, which the Doctor ſays, "ſeveral ſurgeons in our hoſpitals, who had recourſe to it, imagined it was attended with ſucceſs."<note n="38" place="bottom">Dr. Lind's Eſſays, p. 346.</note> In general, both as preventive of infection and as a means of rendering
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:035302_0231_100219C161464F80"/>
the diſeaſe milder, every thing poſſible ſhould be done to keep the room cool, and ſo ventilated as that whilſt a conſtant ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of freſh to infected or foul air takes place, no current of it can immediately affect the perſon of the ſick; and in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to its freſhneſs, no doubt much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage will ariſe from ſaturating it with antiſeptic particles; ſuch as thoſe which ariſe from boiling vinegar, burning cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire, and other ſubſtances of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. I may here alſo mention the uſe of vitriolic aether, the evaporation of which in an infected atmoſphere, may have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent effect in purifying it, and perhaps rendering healthy perſons leſs obnoxious to the action of contagion. I have met with no writer who recommends this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine as a prophylactic, but M. Poiſſonnier, "Quand on <hi>conſidère que quelques onces</hi> d'éther peuvent répandre l'odeur la plus ſuave et la plus ſalutaire dans un trés-grand hôſpital ſera-t-on arrêté par la dèpenſe que cette prè<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendue profuſion occaſionera! Si il eſt un cas où il ſoit beau d'étre prodigue, c'eſt celui où l'on ſoulage les malheureux."<note n="39" place="bottom">Traité ſur les Maladies des gens de Mer. tom. I. p. 360.</note>
               <pb n="217" facs="unknown:035302_0232_100219C42496C688"/>
But as, notwithſtanding the juſtice and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of M. Poiſſonnier's obſervation, the expence attending the liberal uſe of aether in this way will be always an unſurmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able objection to it among the generality of mankind, I would recommend in lieu of it the aetherial oil.<note n="*" place="bottom">Oil of Wine.</note> Its ſmell is amazingly penetrating and permanent, and is highly antiſeptic. The rubbing the bed-poſts with a little of this, and ſprinkling it on places moſt liable to receive and retain infection, would, I have no doubt, be infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the evident neceſſity exiſting for the adopting a plan ſuch as that I have propoſed for the prevention of infection, and deſtroying it when it appears on ſhip-board, it is probable that the cauſes I have mentioned may always render the meaſure abortive. If therefore no proper places are choſen for the purpoſe of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming quarantine, and no lazarettoes are built, ſome other temporary expedient muſt be thought of in an emergency ſo pregnant with miſchief. At the time the malignant peſtilential fever began to rage on ſhip-board,
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:035302_0233_100219C5B8995D58"/>
and before it was communicated to the inhabitants, ſeveral expedients were propoſed to ſtop its progreſs; but none were put in execution. Among theſe, I ſuggeſted to many of the captains, and ſome of the principal inhabitants, the following: The carenage or harbour is ſituated at the bottom of a very extenſive bay, and ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely ſurrounded by land, as to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſecure againſt every wind, except the S. W. which ſeldom blows. The opening into this fine baſon is on the S. W. and is formed by two rocky promontories, on one of which Fort St. George ſtands; the other is private property, but perfectly barren, and ſo ſituated with reſpect to the inhabited part of the neighbouring country, as to be in a manner inſulated. On this I propoſed to have tents, formed of ſails and ſpars, pitched, in which the ſick from the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſhips were to be lodged; temporary cooking places and privies were to be erected in the rear of the encampment; and proper nurſes, and careful ſenſible negroes, as la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers, were to be employed. After land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and lodging the ſick, ſuch ſhips as had no part of their cargoes on board, were to
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:035302_0234_100219C74F8A31F8"/>
put in practice all the uſual means of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying infection; and others were to do the ſame thing after re-landing the ſugar and other produce they had taken on board. To prevent the ſpreading of the infection from this encampment, centinels were to be poſted in ſuch a manner as would effectually prevent ſtragglers from it or to it. It cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly requires no more than the ſimple de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the plan to ſhew its utility; and, ſure I am, had it been adopted, all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent mortality and ſcenes of diſtreſs might have been altogether prevented.</p>
            <p>During the prevalence of a peſtilential fever, the great prophylactics are temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in eating and drinking; regularity in exerciſe; the proper diſtribution of time with reſpect to ſleep and watching; atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to cleanlineſs of perſon; and the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch gratifications as have a tendency to weaken the vital powers. The words of Celſus in his "Obſervatio in Peſtilentia," or fevers ariſing from marſh effluvia, are very comprehenſive: "vitare fatigationem, cruditatem, frigus, calorem, libidinem; mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toque magis ſe continere." Whilſt the
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:035302_0235_100219C981630E88"/>
peſtilential fever raged here, the utility of theſe means was remarkably illuſtrated by the almoſt total exemption of the French inhabitants from the diſeaſe. Their mode of living, compared to that of the Engliſh, is temperate and regular, in an uncommon degree; animal food and ſtrong liquors are very moderately uſed by them; vegetables and ſmall red-wine chiefly compoſe their diet; their paſſions are ſeldom excited to any degree bordering on exceſs; their minds ſeem in general tranquil, or actuated by a vivacity peculiar to themſelves; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, or that ſtate of the animal ſpirits they call Ennui, is never perceived to have place among them. The event too among the negroes, more eſpecially thoſe employed in the cultivation of plantations, affords another ſtriking proof of the great benefit reſulting from temperance during the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of peſtilence; for although it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that the negro race poſſeſs ſomething conſtitutional which reſiſts the action of contagion in a very great degree, ſtill it muſt be admitted that their neceſſary tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance muſt have contributed much in the preſent inſtance to their exemption from
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:035302_0236_100219CC42DF9498"/>
or to the mildneſs of the diſeaſe when it appeared among them. Many of the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants from the French iſlands, particularly Martinique, who from their unhappy ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation could not accommodate themſelves with their cuſtomary modes of living, and whoſe minds, ſuffering under the preſſure of diſappointment and deprivation of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, were ſubject to an unnatural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of ſpirits: and ſome French pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, who, at this time, were obliged to live on ſalted animal food, and to uſe rum diluted for their drink, which articles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the ration of proviſions allowed them by government, did not enjoy the exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion their countrymen, inhabitants of the iſland, experienced. Many of the former, and all the latter had the diſeaſe; and many fell victims to it. Want of cleanlineſs and due ventilation could have little ſhare in increaſing the violence of the diſeaſe among the priſoners; for their confinement was limited to the extent of the ridge of Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital-hill; from the purer air of which the 45th regiment had immediately before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived ſo much benefit.</p>

               <p>The carpenter of the ſhip Charlotte of London, Stephen Holman commander, was attacked in the night with the uſual ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of fever, attended with pain in the eyes, which appeared very much inflamed and watery. He likewiſe complained of pain in the legs near where the gaſtroc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemii muſcles join to form the tendo achillis. His ſtools were of a dark-green colour, and very offenſive: were evacuted by means of a ſolution of ſalts and tartar-emetic; fourteen hours after which the fever was conſiderably abated. At bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, took a diaphoretic anodyne draught; on the following morning was entirely free from fever, and was ordered the bark every hour. In the evening was very low; his pulſe ſmall and quick; no febrile heat; his ſtomach rejected whatever he took; at bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time had an opium pill, but paſſed a very bad night. On the following morning all the unfavourable ſymptoms were increaſed; the ſmell of his breath very offenſive; and the irritability of ſtomach ſo great, that even

opium was rejected as ſoon as ſwallowed. Had him carried on ſhore, but was ſoon after ſeized with convulſions, and died in the courſe of the day. He paſſed no urine from the time he was taken ill till his death, and yet never complained of the ſmalleſt uneaſineſs from that cauſe.</p>

               <p>21ſt March, 1793, went on board the ſhip Baillies, William Sym commander, to ſee John—, one of the crew. Found him very low, his pulſe pretty full, yet it could be ſtopped by the ſlighteſt compreſſion; had no febrile heat; his eyes and ſkin were perfectly yellow; his ſtomach in ſuch a ſtate, that whatever he took was rejected imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately; complained of violent pain in the right ſide; a few ſpots of a dull purple co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour were obſervable on his breaſt and ſhoulders; urine ſcanty, and of a pale-yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low colour. He ſaid he was ſuddenly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked, two days before I ſaw him, with violent headach, dimneſs of ſight, and cold
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:035302_0240_100219D3DDDD4B50"/>
ſhivering, which were very ſoon after fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by convulſions that continued about two hours, as he was told; for he was by no means ſenſible himſelf either of their preſence or duration. Upon recovering from the convulſions, he found himſelf in a hot fever, with violent pains in the legs and eyes. Theſe ſymptoms continued without any abatement till the end of thirty-ſix hours, although he was for the greater part of that time in a profuſe perſpiration. Being fully ſatisfied that his diſeaſe was the malignant fever, which prevailed at the time, and being at the ſame time well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that the common mode of practice in fever was by no means ſucceſsful in this, I thought it neceſſary to try the effects of ſome medicines more powerful than thoſe in common uſe; and my choice in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance was directed to mercury, for two reaſons: the firſt was the evident preſence of local affection; the laſt, and perhaps the moſt cogent of the two, was its being ſtrongly recommended by Dr. Chiſholm; in whoſe hands I had ſeen it productive of the happieſt effects, in a variety of other diſeaſes. The patient was accordingly ordered to take
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:035302_0241_100219D60CC0E868"/>
a pill, compoſed of four grains of calomel and half a grain of opium, every four hours.</p>
               <p>22d. The ſymptoms much the ſame; his ſtomach had frequently rejected the pills during the courſe of the day. Ordered to perſiſt in their uſe.</p>
               <p>23d. In the morning the ſymptoms the ſame as on the preceding day; but towards evening, the uneaſineſs at the ſtomach had greatly abated, and he had rejected only one of the pills during the whole day. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to continue the uſe of the pills.</p>
               <p>24th. About noon the mercury had evidently affected his mouth, and he was ſpitting plentifully. He complained of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now but weakneſs, every other ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the diſeaſe had diſappeared except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the yellow colour of his ſkin and eyes, which went off gradually. By the uſe of freſh diet and a little wine, he was able to do his duty in the ſhip in the courſe of eight days. He had taken, before his mouth was affected, about 48 grains of calomel.</p>

Stephen—, of the ſhip Baillies, a lad about ſeventeen years of age, was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſeized about noon with convulſions, which laſted about an hour and an half. When he began to recover, complained much of pain in the legs, back, head, and eyes, the latter of which were remarkably inflamed and watery: his pulſe very quick and hard; his ſkin, although at the time in a profuſe perſpiration, felt very hot, and on withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hand after touching it, a ſenſe of heat remained in the points of the fingers for ſome time; was evacuated by a ſolution of ſalts and tartar emetic. Towards even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fever began to go off, but was ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the night by coma to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that at eight o'clock on the morning of the 11th, every attempt to rouſe him or make him take any thing was ineffectual.

In the evening, ſymptoms much the ſame, with ſome appearance of delirium, without however any degree of febrile heat, or quickneſs of the pulſe.</p>

               <p>12th. Eight o'clock, A. M. his breathing more affected than on the preceding day, and exceedingly reſtleſs; he ſaid he felt as if about to be ſuffocated, if he continued

A ſolution of ſalts and tartar emetic was immediately given; but not having operated well, on the 11th he had a bolus of ten grains of calomel,
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:035302_0246_100219E2D1590270"/>
followed up by a briſk purge of jalap. By means of theſe, the ſymptoms having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably abated, he began the uſe of the Peruvian bark on the 12th. In the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that day, however, he was ſuddenly ſeized with delirium, and in the night-time, taking advantage of the quiet in the hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, he ſtole out, and walked to the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racks, at leaſt a mile diſtance; in which the commanding officer, imagining he was intoxicated, had him confined. On being brought back the following morning, he had every appearance of fatuity, low fever, cold clammy ſweats, dilated pupils, and ſtaring eyes. With the utmoſt difficulty the aſſiſtants could keep him confined to bed. After having his head ſhaved, I had a large bliſter applied to it, and one to the inſide of each thigh, and ordered ſix grains of calomel, without opium, to be given to him every four hours.</p>
               <p>14th. Bliſters roſe well; the calomel gave him ſeveral ſmall ſtools; urine ſcanty and bloody; a yellow ſuffuſion has begun to appear on his neck and breaſt; ſtill fatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itous. The bliſters to be dreſſed with bliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering

The calomel to be repeated as yeſterday; and to have a tea-ſpoonful of ſweet ſpirit of nitre every two hours, till the ſymptoms of ſtranguary abate. In the evening, fatuity pretty much gone; mouth a little affected; pulſe remarkably ſmall and quick, but ſoft; other ſymptoms as in the morning, only much general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of ſtrength. Ordered a large tea-ſpoonful of bark in a glaſs of Port-wine every hour; to have every third hour a tea-ſpoonful of vitriolic aether in a little cold water; and, ſhould his ſtomach reject the bark, to have it by injection.</p>

Notwithſtanding the uſe of the pills, which agreed well with him, the more untoward ſymptoms, coma, low de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirium at times, cold clammy ſweats came on ſo rapidly, as to induce me to diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the calomel all this day and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, and to give bark and wine. Theſe, however, had no effect; his ſtate ſeemed deſperate; and perceiving, with the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms mentioned, the dilatation of the pupils, I had again recourſe to the calomel on the</p>

In the evening, matters becoming worſe, ordered ſixteen grains of calomel to be given at one doſe. The quantity taken, including this to-day, forty grains.</p>
               <p>20th. The ſame. Fifty grains of calomel to be given at three times, with opium.</p>
               <p>21ſt. In addition to the calomel, I now ordered as much ſpiced Port-wine, and bark and Port-wine, to be given to him as he could poſſibly take.</p>
               <p>22d. Still the ſame. Took fifty-four grains of calomel, and four pints of ſpiced wine yeſterday.</p>
               <p>23d. As he ſtill continued in the ſame ſtate, and as a black fur had formed on his teeth, gums, and tongue, I was afraid to puſh the calomel any further. He had already taken 254 grains without its purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, and without ſhowing any diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to act on the ſalivary glands.

to aſſiſt her by the plentiful uſe of ſpiced wine, and bark and wine. In this ſtate he continued till about noon of the 24th, when a gentle ſpitting came on, which, however, diſappeared about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night. With a view to encourage and bring on the ſalivation, I had his head well wrapped in flannel; and his neck and jaws frequently anointed with warm camphorated oil; and he ſtill continued the bark and ſpiced wine. By means of theſe, a gentle ſalivation was again brought on, and continued till the third of July, when carbuncles broke out all over his body, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the moſt fleſhy parts: ſome of theſe were as large as a ſmall pullet's egg; but in general they were of the ſize of a pigeon's egg. Thoſe of them which opened naturally were dreſſed with digeſtive ointment, and the others had a poultice applied to them.

The purging returned, and more frequent than before; ptyaliſm much abated; much irritability of the ſtomach; coma; and a tendency to delirium; clammineſs and cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſurface.

               <p>Duncan Roſs, a bombardier in the royal artillery, aged about thirty-ſeven, of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably robuſt perſon, and ſtrong conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, was ſeized with all the uſual ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of the malignant peſtilential fever on the 22d of July, but was not reported till 25th, when he was admitted into the hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital. Complained of moſt violent pain in the forehead, back, calves of the legs, and right ſide, with very full and quick pulſe, ardent heat of the ſurface, ſtaring inflamed eyes, and conſiderable irritability of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach. Before his admiſſion he had taken ſome ſalts without my knowledge. He imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:035302_0256_100219F576876960"/>
began to take calomel; of which, in the courſe of the 25th, he took twenty grains, with a proportionate quantity of opium and James's powder. In the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſymptoms were ſo unfavourable, that I judged it neceſſary to adminiſter bark-injections every third hour.</p>
               <p>26th. Much the ſame. Ordered the medicines as yeſterday.</p>
               <p>27th. Irritability of the ſtomach much increaſed. Continued the medicines as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and ordered to have a tea-ſpoonful of aether in water, from time to time, till the vomiting abates.</p>
               <p>28th and 29th. The ſame. No appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ptyaliſm, although he had taken 130 grains of calomel.</p>
               <p>30th. Became comatoſe; frequently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirious; and made violent exertions to get out of bed. His ſkin, which had acquired on the 28th the livid diſagreeable colour conſtantly obſerved in the bad caſes of the fever, became now in ſeveral places of a

               <p>James Knowles, a recruit of the royal artillery, young, ſpare made, but of a florid complexion and ſtrong conſtitution, was admitted into the hoſpital the 25th July, on which day the malignant peſtilential fever ſeized him. It came on with ſtrong convulſions, which was ſucceeded by the uſual ſymptoms in the moſt violent degree. On his admiſſion he had the ſolution of ſalts and tartar-emetic, which operating well, he took, on the morning of the 26th, a pill of five grains of calomel, and one and a half of opium; the calomel was repeated every three hours; and as there was much irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the ſtomach, a large bliſter was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the epigaſtric region.</p>
               <p>27th. Tendency to coma and delirium; moſt ardent heat and dry ſkin; of a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour much inclining to livid; the quantity of calomel doubled; and, as what he had already taken had purged him, ordered a grain of opium every three or four hours to check it.</p>

28th. Continual vomiting, coma, and delirium; the latter more violent than uſual attended with continual ſobbing, ſighing, and ſhedding of tears. Former ſcenes were continually preſented to his imagination; and, as if in the midſt of his domeſtic friends, he related the circumſtances, but with much incoherency. It was remarkable, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all theſe were related in a moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultory, unconnected manner, and with a total forgetfulneſs of the place or ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation he then was in, they excited pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lamentations, and a profuſe diſcharge of tears; and if for a moment he hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to recollect himſelf, he bitterly accuſed himſelf of folly, in a diſpoſition ſtrongly compoſed of gaiety, or ſeeming gaiety, and the deepeſt melancholy. During this dreadful ſcene, which I was unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately a witneſs to, he frequently made moſt violent attempts to get out of bed; and on being prevented by the aſſiſtants, he upbraided them for their cruelty, in the names of his friends or former companions. Towards evening he had ſeveral convulſive paroxyſms, in one of which he expired; completing exactly ſeventy-two hours.</p>

               <p>September 9th. Thomas Smith, a ſecond gunner of the royal artillery, was admitted into the hoſpital, labouring under the uſual ſymptoms of the prevailing epidemic in the ſecond degree of violence; had the ſolution of ſalts and tartar-emetic, which operating well, was followed up on the 10th with the ſaline draughts, and a proportion of ſpt. nitri dulc. The ſymptoms, however, not yielding to this, he began in the evening the uſe of calomel.

               <p>16th. Had 76 grains of calomel ſince yeſterday morning; the laſt 20 without opium; in conſequence of which, he had two ſtools. Thinks his mouth is rather fore; turbid brown urine; brown parched tongue, and black furred teeth and fauces. Deep yellow ſuffuſion ſince the afternoon of the 14th, interſperſed with <hi>petechical</hi> ſpots, and vibices on the neck; perfectly collected. A bliſter that was applied to the head, and one to the inſide of each thigh, in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of yeſterday, roſe well; but during the night delirious at times; at preſent coma and clammineſs of the ſurface, although pulſe 100. and pretty full, with ſome degree of hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.

At noon, the ſame quantity to be repeated; and if a purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhould come on, to check it with a grain of opium from time to time. The Anguſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura bark as yeſterday. In the evening, ſtill comatoſe; at no times delirious; had

40 grains of calomel, which having brought on a purging, two grains of opium were given every two hours to check it; which had the effect after ſix were taken. In every reſpect as in the morning; urine turbid; no calomel; but injections com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of two ounces of Peruvian bark, with a ſufficiency of Port-wine to render it fluid, and two tea-ſpoonfuls of laudanum to be adminiſtered every two hours.</p>
               <p>17th. In the courſe of the night ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times delirious; calm and collected at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but coma and clammineſs of the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face ſtill continue. Yellow ſuffuſion of a deeper hue; and the ſerous diſcharge from the bliſters, as well as the urine, of the ſame colour. Had five injections ſince the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of yeſterday, each compoſed of two ounces of bark and half a pint of Port-wine, and a tea-ſpoonful of laudanum; urine turbid, but has depoſited a ſmall ſediment of a granulous texture, and whitiſh colour. Ordered the bark injections, the Anguſtura bark, and ſpiced wine. In the evening, had five injections ſince morning, three of which were immediately paſſed; his ſtomach, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:035302_0264_10021A05ECD02330"/>
has been remarkably retentive, ſo that he has taken more than an ounce of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtura bark. In the afternoon, the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium increaſed very much; and at that time he made ſeveral violent exertions to get out of bed, and was ſo affected at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance made to them, that he called out Murder, and expreſſed otherwiſe great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation of mind. He appears, however, at preſent calm, and as collected as in the morning. Remarkably deaf; which he is himſelf ſenſible of. In the courſe of the day, marks of ſubſultus tendinum; which have now diſappeared: pulſe 112; warm moiſture on the ſurface, without clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineſs; comatoſe; lies chiefly on his back, with his eyes open. Ordered the injections, with a double quantity of laudanum, and a larger quantity of the Anguſtura bark.</p>
               <p>18th. Had only three injections in the courſe of the night, and they were admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtered with conſiderable difficulty, owing to his prejudice againſt them; ſtomach very retentive, has taken two ounces of Anguſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura bark ſince laſt night. Having a ſtrong
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:035302_0265_10021A07850D80B8"/>
inclination for rum and water, he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, by being told the doſe of Anguſtura bark was grog. In the night-time, made only one attempt to get out of bed; and had much leſs delirium than uſual. Still comatoſe, however, on being called to, ſeems perfectly ſenſible of his ſituation; no pain; no ſubſultus tendinum; and ſurface warm, and covered with warm moiſture, nowiſe clammy; deafneſs continues; pulſe 104. Ordered to have, from time to time, a little rum and water; to continue the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections; and the Anguſtura bark in as large quantity as poſſible. In the evening had three injections, but paſſed them almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately. Took an ounce and an half of Anguſtura bark. Symptoms much as before: pulſe 102; when offered the diluted rum, tho' only the full of a common wine-glaſs, he expreſſed his ſatisfaction by ſaying, "it is glorious." Continue medicines.</p>
               <p>19th. Had only two injections during the night; would not permit any more to be given; has taken more than an ounce of Anguſtura bark; no delirium, but comatoſe. Some appearance of the hippocratic counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:035302_0266_10021A092B099BD0"/>
to-day; thick black fur on his tongue, which impedes his ſpeech much: moiſture, heat, &amp;c. as laſt night; ſleep more natural, and lies on his ſide, which he has not done hitherto; urine very turbid, and of a brown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh colour, inclining to green, without any depoſition of ſediment; pulſe 104. Had a gill and half of rum diluted in water during the night. Continue the medicines as before. In the evening, had only two injections, which were kept. Having ordered equal parts of Peruvian and Anguſtura bark to be given by the mouth, inſtead of the latter alone, two doſes were given, but owing to the taſte of the former, which he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſenſible of, or to the peculiar diſlike always manifeſted in this fever to it, he vomited them up almoſt immediately; eat a good deal of beef-ſoup, and ſome meat, both of which he called for. Symptoms much as before; takes the rum and water greedily. Continue the injections, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtura bark alone.</p>
               <p>20th. Had three injections; one ounce and half of Anguſtura bark, and about a gill of rum diluted. Symptoms as yeſterday.
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:035302_0267_10021A0E46A7A4D0"/>
Slept a little; pulſe 96; urine very turbid, and of a deep brown or porter-colour, with ſeveral clouds of the ſame colour floating near the bottom of the glaſs. Stools, of which he has one generally in the twenty-four hours, are not foetid.</p>
               <p>21ſt. Since yeſterday morning had ſix injections, and two ounces of Anguſtura bark; and laſt night took ſome oatmeal-gruel and wine; pulſe 108. Symptoms pretty much as before. In the evening, much more ſenſible than he has been at any time ſince the commencement of the fever. Tongue free of black fur, but ſtill dry; fur on the teeth and fauces gone alſo. Has expreſſed a wiſh to have the injections diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continued, as he thinks he can take the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruvian bark and wine by the mouth. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to continue the injections, Anguſtura bark, nouriſhment, and diluted rum.</p>
               <p>22d. Much the ſame as yeſterday, only pulſe 112. Continue medicines, &amp;c.</p>

browniſh, and to-day cracked, with, near its extremity, ſomething like browniſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured pus; pulſe 110. Continue medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>24th. Rather more of the cadaverous ſmell to-day than uſual; other ſymptoms nearly as before. Pulſe however ſeems to quicken, and at the ſame time to diminiſh in ſtrength and fulneſs; to-day it is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably feeble, almoſt thready, and 114 in a minute. Had no injections laſt night, as he took the Peruvian bark and wine by the mouth. Continue.</p>
               <p>25th. Pulſe 108, and more feeble and thready than yeſterday; perfectly ſenſible, but debility increaſed to an extreme degree. Took in the courſe of the night almoſt a bottle of wine, and two ounces of Peruvian bark. In the evening, having continued to take the Peruvian bark and wine very liberally during the day, for the firſt time complained of ptyalitic ſymptoms. On of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering him ſome ſoup, he immediately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of its occaſioning a moſt unuſual heat and pain throughout the whole of his
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:035302_0269_10021A0FD8B028F0"/>
mouth and throat; and even rum and water, which hitherto he preferred to any thing elſe, he has refuſed, not from diſlike, but from the pain the ſwallowing it brought on. More ſenſible than ever. Continue the bark, wine, and nouriſhment.</p>
               <p>26th. Lower to-day than uſual, although he took in the courſe of the night a bottle of wine, and two ounces of bark; pulſe much more feeble and thready, and evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tremulous; 112 in a minute. Soreneſs continues, but nothing like ſpitting. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue medicines, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>27th. Pulſe 120, feeble and tremulous; tongue for the firſt time clean and moiſt; urine leſs turbid, and more of the colour of fined porter; and has precipitated a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſediment, of a yellowiſh colour. Soreneſs rather increaſed; takes much nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, and a large quantity of wine and bark. Continue medicines, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>28th. Pulſe remarkably indiſtinct, and ſo ſmall as ſcarcely to be felt; it appears to

               <p>29th. Pulſe 116; more diſtinct than yeſterday; feeble, but not thready; ſkin, at length, ſoft and agreeably cool; has now recovered in a great meaſure his natural tone of voice, which hitherto has been low, ſhrill, and drawling. Appetite increaſed much. Soreneſs of his mouth much as on the 27th, with now a very moderate ſpitting. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue medicines, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>30th. Pulſe 116, perfectly diſtinct, but ſtill rather weak and ſmall; ſoft ſkin, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, as before. Continue medicines, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>From this time he continued recovering till November 2, when he had acquired ſo much ſtrength as to be able to quit the hoſpital and do his duty.</p>

4th. Much lower, and frequently inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; at other times made violent exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to get out of bed; very delirious. What had hitherto been done having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced no effect, I determined to-day on giving him the Anguſtura bark, without much expectation of his deriving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit from it, but to ſatisfy myſelf that nothing had been left untried. He accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly took twenty grains in water every two hours.</p>
               <p>5th. I examined the ſtate of his urine to-day; it was clear, and of the colour of brandy, without any ſediment or cloud; great thirſt; parched tongue and fauces, and of a browniſh colour. Continue the Anguſtura bark.</p>

               <p>Henry M'Kendry, a young man of a florid complexion and ſmall ſtature, was ſeized with the ſymptoms of the peſtilential fever on the morning of the 7th of Auguſt, had lately arrived from England, and been once troubled with ſlight ſymptoms of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentery ſince his arrival; had taken a vomit of 20 grains of ipecacuanha, and one of emetic-tartar, immediately after the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of the fever appeared; and, after its operation, began the uſe of the Anguſtura bark; the diſcharge from the ſtomach con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of at leaſt two quarts of poracious bile, which emitted a moſt offenſive ſmell; the vomit alſo operated by ſtool ſeveral times, which diſcharge was likewiſe very foetid. Before the morning of the 8th, he took fully an ounce of the Anguſtura bark, at which time moſt of the ſymptoms had diſappeared,
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:035302_0276_10021A1EB828FBD0"/>
particularly the headach and nauſea. On the 8th, and the following night, he took two ounces of the bark; and on the 9th felt himſelf conſiderably better. His urine on this day was of a deep brandy-colour, and precipitated a conſiderable quantity of whitiſh ſediment. He continued the uſe of the Anguſtura bark till the 13th, when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and other ſigns of returning health, were ſo evident as to render the further adminiſtration of medicines unneceſſary. In a very ſhort time after, he was perfectly recovered.</p>

               <p>Robert Mill, a bombardier of the royal artillery, was on the 14th of Auguſt ſeized with pain in the forehead, ſinciput, and temples, with the other uſual ſymptoms of the prevailing epidemic, which in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing increaſed to a very alarming height; cold ſweats, irritability of ſtomach, and tendency to coma, with the ſtaring prominent eye.

<pb n="262" facs="unknown:035302_0277_10021A204E662070"/>
of ipecacuanha and the antimonial; and late in the evening, he began to take the Anguſtura bark.</p>
               <p>15th. General ſymptoms conſiderably abated; irritability of ſtomach almoſt gone; took upwards of two ounces in the courſe of the night and morning of the Anguſtura bark. Ordered to continue the Anguſtura bark with, occaſionally, a ſmall addition of thebaic tincture.</p>
               <p>16th. Complaints almoſt gone; urine very dark-coloured, almoſt ſimilar to a ſtrong infuſion of tobacco, and turbid, with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable depoſition of whitiſh ſediment in ſmall cakes. Continue the Anguſtura bark as yeſterday.</p>

               <p>I ſhall beg leave to make an obſervation here, which I neglected in its proper place. A few drops of thebaic tincture will always be a good addition to either the Peruvian or Anguſtura bark; for as the nervous ſyſtem
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:035302_0278_10021A2278EA6770"/>
is very much affected in the malignant peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilential fever, this, as an antiſpaſmodic, will be found a moſt uſeful medicine; and given, mixed with the antiſeptic, will have the double advantage of quieting the general irregular motions of the nerves, and of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the ſtomach in ſuch a manner as to enable it to retain the medicine with which it is combined. Solid opium has in no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance I have met with, acted with equal efficacy. Whether it is, that the opium has been diſcharged before any part of it could be diſſolved; or, that the tone of the ſtomach and inteſtines being ſuſpended, it has paſſed off without their being affected by it.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude with a Caſe in which very large quantities of the Anguſtura bark always retained, had not the leaſt effect in preventing a fatal termination.</p>

and conſtitution, aged 25, on the evening of the 29th of Auguſt, a few days after his arrival on the iſland, was ſeized with all the uſual ſymptoms of the malignant peſtilential fever in the more violent degree. This gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman had heard before his arrival of the dreadful devaſtation committed by this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; and knew that three other officers, who had ſome time before croſſed the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantic in the ſame ſhip with him, had fallen ſacrifices to it in the very houſe in which he was then quartered. Theſe circumſtances had impreſſed him with a juſt dread of the evil he had much reaſon to expect, and no doubt added very conſiderably to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural violence of the ſymptoms. After being well evacuated by means of a vomit of ipecacuanha and tartar-emetic, and a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of ſalts and tartar-emetic, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe diaphoreſis having broken out by noon of the 30th, he began the Anguſtura bark in doſes of a ſcruple, repeated every hour. The two firſt he retained; but afterwards, the inſtant the bark reached the ſtomach, it was rejected. During the remainder of this day, all the 31ſt, and greateſt part of the 1ſt of September, the irritability continued.
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:035302_0280_10021A3295ED4800"/>
Neither medicine nor nouriſhment could be retained; his ſkin became dry, his tongue and fauces parched, the former of a brown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh colour; a weakening diſcharge by ſtool came on, of a moſt foetid ſmell and blackiſh colour. I gave him calomel joined to ſolid opium all the 31ſt; but this paſſing off by ſtool, increaſed the general weakneſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a poſſibility of its acting on the ſalivary glands. He now again tried the Anguſtura bark, but in vain; and as nothing elſe could be at all effectual in ſtopping the progreſs of the diſeaſe, I determined to perſevere in it, in hopes of its being at length wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, or at leaſt ſuch a portion of it as might be ſufficient to prevent gangrene. In the night-time, he himſelf propoſed that this bark ſhould be mixed in ſome ſtrong wine or ſpirit, which might prevent its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. Capt. D'Arcy, of the ſame corps, who carefully attended him, luckily recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected that he had by him ſome infuſion of Peruvian bark in Port-wine, that had been made upwards of a month before; and of this he gave Mr. Watkins an half wine-glaſsful, and repeated it at the end of two hours. Its effect was aſtoniſhing; for
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:035302_0281_10021A3455292128"/>
when, at the expiration of two hours more, a doſe of Anguſtura bark in water, with ten drops of laudanum, was given, he ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it without diſguſt, and kept it. From this time he continued the Anguſtura bark with the laudanum, and, retaining it, was, when I ſaw him on the 2d about noon, by which time he had taken and retained twelve doſes, totally free from fever; eaſy in every reſpect; his ſkin agreeably cool, with a general warm moiſture on it; the ſtaring prominency and redneſs of his eyes had almoſt entirely diſappeared. In ſhort, he ſeemed now to be in a fair way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, although the preceding day I had formed the moſt unfavourable prognoſtic of his ſituation; but alas! how flattering was all this! On viſiting him on the 3d, I found a change had taken place in the night; he ſuddenly became delirious, the protruſion and ſtaring of his eyes returned, every muſcle was affected with tremor; but his ſkin continued cool, and his ſtomach ſtill retained the Anguſtura bark. When I ſaw him he was nearly in this ſtate, only the coolneſs of the ſkin was attended with a clammy moiſture. Together with the bark,
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:035302_0282_10021A37B6D15340"/>
which he took and retained remarkably well, I ordered a large bliſter to be applied between the ſhoulders, chiefly with a view to overcome, if poſſible, the general ſpaſm.</p>
               <p>4th. During the night the delirium in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed much, and alternated with coma; the muſcular ſpaſm was much more violent; the ſurface of his body was cold and clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and ſome vibices appeared on the neck. The bliſter roſe remarkably well, and his ſtomach continued remarkably retentive; this was his ſtate, with the addition of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility, when I ſaw him near noon. A curious circumſtance (obſerved by the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants frequently, and by myſelf once) was the rapid change and alternate ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of colour of the ſkin, from very pale to dingy, or livid, or to bright yellow; theſe ſucceeded each other in the ſpace of a few minutes; at the end of which, his ſkin became of the uſual dirty, livid hue, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the complaint. An hour after, the alternate ſucceſſion would come on again; and after continuing the ſame length of time, would be ſucceeded by the livid co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and ſo on. About four in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon,
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:035302_0283_10021A394E29CB20"/>
a violent convulſion came on, and continued a few minutes; his reſpiration became now extremely oppreſſed, and he frequently, as if by a natural impulſe, laid his hand acroſs the pit of the ſtomach; the muſcular ſpaſm now increaſed ſo much as to ſhake the bed with much violence. About ſix o'clock, another violent convulſion car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him off. During the two laſt days he took upwards of three ounces of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtura bark, and fully three bottles of Port-wine, with a good deal of nouriſhment, which indeed he generally had a craving for.</p>

AFTER finiſhing the foregoing little ESSAY, it was not my intention to add any thing further on the ſubject. Since then, however, ſo many aditional, and if poſſible more powerful, proofs have occurred of the ſuperior efficacy of the Mercurial Treatment in the Malignant Peſtilential Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that I ſhould conſider myſelf as acting unjuſtly to the Public, as well as wanting in humanity, did I withhold a ſhort account of them, by way of Poſtſcript to what I have already written.</p>

THE year 1794, whilſt it unhappily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced many hundred inſtances of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant peſtilential fever in Grenada, alſo afforded the moſt unequivocal proofs of the ſuperior efficacy of mercury in the treatment of that dreadful malady. Although in one inſtance the diſeaſe was evidently introduced by an American veſſel from Martinico, in the month of February; and in another, by an Engliſh trader from the ſame iſland, after its capture, yet it is highly probable, that, from the cauſes I have mentioned, the town of St. George has been at no time ſince the firſt introduction of the diſeaſe by the Hankey, in February, 1793, intirely clear of the infection; the rum-ſhops having been a never-failing receptacle of it. The want of ſubjects to act on, might ſuſpend the operation of the contagion for a time; but the arrival of ſtrangers, to whom it has uniformly been deleterious, gave life to its ſeeds, which had hitherto been concealed, not deſtroyed.</p>

As it formerly not unfrequently hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, from the neceſſary timidity a practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner feels who adopts a new remedy in the treatment of one of the moſt dangerous and deſtructive maladies the human frame is ſubject to, that that remedy was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways puſhed to the length which ſecures its efficacy; ſo on the reappearance of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, I was determined to give the calomel earlier, and in much greater quantity than the preceding year. Accordingly, inſtead of preceding the adminiſtration of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent remedy with the uſual evacuating medicines, I began with it, and continued it without the interpoſition of any other, till ſalivation took place. The ſucceſs at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending this practice exceeded my moſt ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine expectation; ſo great indeed was it, that I did not loſe a ſingle patient in whoſe caſe it was puſhed to the full extent. My practice will, no doubt, by many be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as unwarrantably bold; but as its wonderful ſucceſs has been experienced by ſeveral other practitioners, who can bear teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony to it, I feel not the ſmalleſt heſitation in recommending it with all the fervor which an earneſt wiſh to ſave the lives of
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:035302_0287_10021A4162F7ACE8"/>
men, and the fulleſt conviction of, I am almoſt inclined to ſay, its infallibility, can give riſe to.</p>
               <p>My mode of uſing the calomel ſince the reappearance of the diſeaſe, is to give ten grains to an adult patient as ſoon as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible after I ſee him. This generally acts as an aperient in the degree required, about an hour or two after it is given. At the end of three hours I repeat the ſame doſe without opium, if the firſt had not purged more than twice. At the end of three hours more, the ſame quantity is given, adding opium or not, as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding doſes have acted. In this manner ten grains are given every three hours till the ſalivary glands become affected; which ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally happens in leſs than twenty-four hours from the commencement of the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The effect of the medicine given in this manner, may be perceived after the third doſe in general; the patient becoming calmer, leſs reſtleſs, leſs anxious; his ſkin being ſofter, and poſſeſſed of an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able heat; the ſtomach being perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive, however irritable it might have
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:035302_0288_10021A42F7473EC0"/>
been before; and the eyes recovering their former luſtre and ſenſibility. When, at length, ſalivation takes place, the patient is left free from diſeaſe, with a moderate warm moiſture on his ſkin; and very ſoon after, ſigns of returning health are indicated by calls for food, &amp;c. The recovery of ſtrength is proportionally rapid to that from diſeaſe; nor is it at all neceſſary to have recourſe to bark, or any other medicine whatſoever: a circumſtance truly gratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both to the patient and phyſician, in a diſeaſe wherein Nature revolts at the very idea of it. In fact, calomel is the only medicine, except the occaſional addition of opium, I have latterly given; of courſe the practice has been as ſimple as it has been efficacious: an additional encouragement to the practitioner, and to thoſe whoſe ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may render them liable to receive the peſtilential infection.</p>
               <p>On my way to Europe, in the month of July laſt, I was detained a month at St. Chriſtopher's, waiting for convoy. During that time, I had frequent opportunities of converſing on the malignant peſtilential
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:035302_0289_10021A452F2D1A48"/>
fever with ſome ingenious and eminent practitioners of that iſland; who informed me, that the want of ſucceſs they expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced in the various modes of treatment they adopted during the prevalence of that epidemic, in the latter months of 1793, made them dread a ſecond viſit of it as the greateſt calamity that could befal the colony, At this time the arrival of a ſhip at Baſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre from Martinico, with the malignant peſtilential fever on board, gave me an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of diſplaying the efficacy of the mercurial treatment; which had never before been thought or heard of there. Dr. Armſtrong, who to the moſt pleaſing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of a gentleman adds uncommon me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical ability, and the candor which always accompanies both, attended the ſick on board this veſſel. The firſt patient was a ſtrong, robuſt man, ſome time before arrived from Europe, and who had the further diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of having been three days ill before medical aſſiſtance could be called in. The worſt ſymptoms had already appeared; ſuch as continual vomiting, coma, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirium peculiar to the diſeaſe. The Doctor, by my advice, began with ten grains of
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:035302_0290_10021A47F2C41FD0"/>
calomel, and repeated it without opium, as it did not purge, every three hours. To his aſtoniſhment, and contrary to the prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtic of the other medical gentlemen to whom he communicated the caſe, a ſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation coming on before the expiration of twenty-four hours, the uſual ſigns of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning health immediately after ſucceeded.</p>
               <p>Since my arrival in England, I have had peculiar ſatisfaction in finding that a treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment nearly ſimilar to the above had been adopted with great ſucceſs in the malignant peſtilential fever, which ſo fatally prevailed at Philadelphia during the autumn of 1793. Dr. Ruſh's medical talents and merit are too well known and too generally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to require the feeble efforts of my pen to extol them. If any thing, however, could add to the excellence of this gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's character, it muſt be his benevolent exertion, and unwearied perſeverance dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the exiſtence of this dreadful calamity, in relieving his helpleſs and afflicted fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-citizens, and in purſuing the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial mode of treatment, with the weight of prejudice and malignity in oppoſition
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:035302_0291_10021A498B23FD60"/>
to him. Such fortitude is rarely met with in the medical profeſſion; and when it is, it muſt ſecure our admiration and reſpect. Whether the diſeaſe deſcribed by Dr. Ruſh, under the name of the "Bilious Remitting Yellow Fever," was produced in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the malignant peſtilential fever was in Grenada, is a matter of no great import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; it is ſufficient to know, that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes were exactly the ſame; and that a ſimilar treatment proved ſucceſsful in both. I have alſo had uncommon ſatisfaction in reading the following note in the ingenious Dr. Clark's late publication: "Obſervations on the Diſeaſes which prevail in long Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages to Hot Countries," &amp;c. vol. II. p. 297. "When engorgement of the brain takes place, to any conſiderable degree, in fevers, no medicine which has hitherto been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended is capable of removing it; and therefore I hope I ſhall be excuſed for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing mercury (the only medicine which has been found adequate to remove obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate congeſtions in the other viſcera) in ſuch a deplorable and dangerous ſituation. But, at the ſame time, I confeſs I am not able to point out the particular caſes to which
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:035302_0292_10021A4B450DC320"/>
this practice will apply, from not being able, certainly, to diſtinguiſh <hi>engorgement</hi> of the brain from mere <hi>irritability</hi> of that organ; the ſymptoms in both being ſimilar." I truſt the obſervations I have offered in the foregoing ſheets will remove the difficulty ſtarted by Dr. Clark, and direct the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, in the exhibition of mercury, in malignant peſtilential fevers, at leaſt to thoſe ſtadia of the diſeaſe wherein it is the only remedy that can be given with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. I am confident, not from analogy, or the probability of the thing itſelf, but from actual and very extenſive experience, that mercury is, in general, the only truly uſeful medicine in all fevers depending on congeſtions it the viſcera; or, as I have expreſſed it in another place,<note n="1" place="bottom">Medical Commentaries. vol. 19.</note> on glandular obſtruction and viſceral inflammation. And is it not probable that all fevers depend, proximately, on thoſe cauſes? Upon the whole, the weight of evidence in favour of the mercurial treatment brought forwards by Dr. Clark, Dr. Ruſh, Dr. Wade, and
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:035302_0293_10021A4E1CE1F390"/>
myſelf, in circumſtances nearly ſimilar, muſt ſurely impreſs every mind, even thoſe moſt influenced by prejudice and theory, with a conviction not only of its utility, but of its certainty, if judiciouſly conducted.</p>
               <p>In India, in England, in North America, and the Weſt India iſlands, medical gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, totally unconnected with each other, have recurred to the ſame practice, and heſitate not to declare to the public, that the event has been uniformly the ſame. Why ſhould not peſtilential infection have its antidote, as well as others once equally fatal? "They have narrow conceptions, not only of the Divine Goodneſs, but of the gradual progreſs of human knowledge, who ſuppoſe that all peſtilential diſeaſes ſhall not, like the ſmall-pox, ſooner or later ceaſe to be the ſcourge and terror of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind."<note n="2" place="bottom">Ruſh's Account of the Bilious Yellow Fever, p. 327.</note> Let the knowledge of this ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary innovation in medicine be generally diffuſed; let the confidence it merits be placed in it; let the deſtructive dogmata

                  <p>IN obedience to your deſire, I have ſent you the hiſtory of the yellow fever as it appeared here in the year 1748, which, as far as I can remember, agreed in its ſymptoms with the ſame diſeaſe, when it viſited this town in former years. In <hi>this</hi> hiſtory, I have confined myſelf to a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful narration of facts, and have avoided any phyſical inquiry into the cauſes of the ſeveral ſymptoms in this diſeaſe; as that would have required more leiſure than I am, at preſent, maſter of, and would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have been leſs uſeful than a plain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</p>

I wrote this hiſtory, ſo far as it relates to the ſymptoms and prognoſtics, in the year 1748, when we had the diſeaſe laſt in this place; intending afterwards, if it return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to add, from further experience, the method of cure, and likewiſe an account of any other ſymptoms which might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it; but as no ſuch opportunity has offered, I muſt now omit that part. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I hope the deſcription which I have given of this dreadful malady, which ſo frequently rages like the plague in the ſouthern parts of America, is ſo full, that a phyſician may, from thence, not only form a true judgment of its nature, but likewiſe be able to deduce and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate ſome more certain method of cure, than has perhaps hitherto been uſed.</p>
                  <p>I am ſorry I could not give a fuller account of the diſſections of thoſe who died of this diſeaſe, having unfortunately loſt my notes taken from thoſe diſſections.</p>

I. THAT <hi>fever,</hi> which continues two or three days, and terminates without any critical diſcharge by ſweat, urine, ſtool, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> leaving the patient exceſſively weak, with a ſmall pulſe, eaſily depreſſible by very little motion, or by an erect poſture; and <hi>which</hi> is ſoon ſucceeded with an icteritious colour in the white of the eyes and the ſkin, vomiting, haemorrhages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and theſe, without being accompanied with any degree of a febrile pulſe and heat, is called in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, the <hi>yellow fever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. THIS fever does not ſeem to take its origin from any particular conſtitution of the weather, independent of <hi>infectious miaſmata,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Warren</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">In his Treatiſe concerning the malignant fever in Barbadoes, page 8.</note> has formerly well obſerved.</p>
            <p>FOR within theſe twenty-five years, it has only been four times epidemical in this town, namely, in the autumns of the years 1732, 39, 45 and 48, though none of theſe years (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting that of 1739, whoſe ſummer and autumn were remarkably rainy) were either
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:035302_0298_10021A31023406A0"/>
warmer or more rainy (and ſome of them leſs ſo) than the ſummers and autumns were in ſeveral other years, in which we had not one inſtance of any one being ſeized with this fever; which is contrary to what would probably have happened, if particular conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of the weather were productive of it, without infectious <hi>miaſmata.</hi> But that this is really an infectious diſeaſe, ſeems plain, not only from this, that almoſt all the nurſes catched it and died of it; but likewiſe, as ſoon as it appeared in town, it ſoon invaded new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comers, thoſe who never had the diſeaſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and country-people when they came to town, while thoſe who remained in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try eſcaped it, as likewiſe did thoſe who had formerly felt its <hi>dire</hi> effects, though they walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about the town, viſited the ſick in all the different <hi>ſtadia</hi> of the diſeaſe, and attended the funeral of thoſe who died of it. And laſtly, whenever the diſeaſe appeared here, it was eaſily traced to ſome perſon who had lately arrived from ſome of the Weſt-Indian Iſlands, where it was epidemical. Although the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection was ſpread with great celerity through the town, yet if any from the country receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it in town, and ſickened on their return
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:035302_0299_10021A59FA90E3B0"/>
home, the infection ſpread no further, not even ſo much as to one in the ſame houſe.</p>
            <p>III. THE ſubjects which were ſuſceptible of this fever, were both ſexes of the white colour, eſpecially ſtrangers lately arrived from cold climates, Indians, Miſtees, Mulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes of all ages, excepting young children and of thoſe only ſuch as had formerly eſcaped the infection. And indeed it is a great happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that our conſtitutions undergo ſuch al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations in the ſmall-pox, meaſles and yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fever, as for ever afterwards ſecure us from a ſecond attack of thoſe diſeaſes. There is ſomething very ſingular in the conſtitution of the Negroes, which renders them not lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to this fever; for though many of theſe were as much expoſed as the nurſes to the infection, yet I never knew one inſtance of this fever amongſt them, though they are equally ſubject with the white people to the <hi>bilious fever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IV. THIS fever began in the middle or rather towards the end of Auguſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till near the middle of October, when the weather became cold enough to prevent
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:035302_0300_10021A5B92973378"/>
its further progreſs. In the beginning of Auguſt, the weather was warmer than I had ever known it in that month: the mercury in Farenheit's thermometer, for ſome days at 2 o'clock, <hi>p. m.</hi> roſe, in the ſhaded air, to the 96th degree, at which time ſeveral people died of apoplexies. The latter part of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt and the firſt week in September were much more temperate; the weather being then much as uſual at that ſeaſon of the year. The ſecond week in September was cold, the wind being conſtantly eaſterly and the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cloudy; after which time I kept a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter of the heat of the ſhaded air; an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract of which follows.</p>

            </p>
            <p>IN all the month of September, and in the greateſt part of October, the wind was eaſterly.</p>
            <p>THE depth of the rain in Auguſt, Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember and October reſpectively, was 6.881, 7.442 and 5.550 inches; which, though it exceeded the rain of theſe three months tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en together at a medium, from the ten pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding years, by 5.570 inches, yet it was inferior to that which fell in the ſame months in ſeveral other years; for in the years 1747, 50, 51 and 52, there fell re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively, in thoſe three months of theſe years, above 21, 22, 24 and 26 inches of rain.</p>
            <p>V. FOR a day or two before the attack of the fever, people in general complained of a headach, pain in the loins and extremities, eſpecially in the knees and calves of the legs, loſs of appetite, debility and a ſpontaneous laſſitude.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="288" facs="unknown:035302_0302_10021A60A6E86F18"/>
SOME, however, were ſeized ſuddenly, without any ſuch previous ſymptoms.</p>
            <p>VI. AFTER a chillneſs and horror, with which this diſeaſe generally invades, a fever ſucceeded, in which,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE <hi>pulſe</hi> was very frequent till near the termination of the fever, and was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally full, hard, and conſequently ſtrong: in ſome, it was ſmall and hard, in others, ſoft and ſmall; but in all thoſe caſes, it frequently varied in its fulneſs and hardneſs. Towards the termination of the fever, the pulſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſmaller, harder, and leſs frequent. In ſome there was a remarkable throbbing in the carotids and in the <hi>hypochondria;</hi> in the latter of which it was ſometimes ſo great, that it cauſed a conſtant tremulous motion of the <hi>abdomen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. THE <hi>heat,</hi> generally, did not exceed 102 degrees of Farenheit's thermometer; in ſome it was leſs, it varied frequently, and was commonly nearly equal in all parts, the heat about the <hi>praecordia</hi> being ſeldom more intenſe than in the extremities, when theſe were kept covered. In the firſt day of the
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:035302_0303_10021A6238AED188"/>
diſeaſe, ſome had frequent returns of a ſenſe of chillneſs, though there was not any abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their heat. In a few, there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened ſo great a remiſſion of the heat for ſome hours, when at the ſame time the pulſe was ſoft and leſs frequent and the ſkin moiſt, that one from theſe circumſtances might reaſonably have hoped that the fever would only prove a remittent or intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. About the end of the ſecond day, the heat began to abate.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE <hi>ſkin</hi> was ſometimes (though rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) dry; but oftener, and indeed generally, it was moiſt and diſpoſed to ſweat.</p>
            <p>ON the firſt day, the ſweating was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly profuſe and general; on the ſecond day, it was more moderate: but on both theſe, there happened frequent and ſhort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions of the ſweatings; at which times the febrile heat increaſed, and the patient became more uneaſy. On the third day, the diſpoſition to ſweat was ſo much abated, that the ſkin was generally dry; only the forehead and backs of the hands continued moiſt.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="290" facs="unknown:035302_0304_10021A6465374478"/>
4. THE <hi>reſpiration</hi> was by no means fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent or difficult, but was ſoon accelerated by motion, or the fatigue of drinking a cup of any liquid.</p>
            <p n="5">5. THE <hi>tongue</hi> was moiſt, rough and white, even to its tip and edges. On the ſecond day, its middle in ſome was brown. On the third day, the whiteneſs and rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the tongue began to abate.</p>
            <p n="6">6. THE <hi>thirſt</hi> in very few was great.</p>
            <p n="7">7. A <hi>nauſea, vomiting</hi> or frequent <hi>reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> to vomit, eſpecially after the exhibition of either medicines or food, came on gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the third day, as the fever began to leſſen; or rather as the fullneſs of the pulſe, heat, and diſpoſition to ſweat began to abate. Some indeed, but very few, on the firſt day, had a vomiting either bilious or phlegmatic.</p>
            <p n="8">8. VERY few complained of <hi>anxiety</hi> or oppreſſion about the <hi>praecordia</hi> or <hi>hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> nor was there any tenſion or hardneſs about the latter.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb n="291" facs="unknown:035302_0305_10021A660929E2E0"/>
9. ON the firſt day they generally <hi>dozed</hi> much, but afterwards were very <hi>watchful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>Reſtleſſneſs</hi> and almoſt continual <hi>jacta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> came on the ſecond day.</p>
            <p n="11">11. A great <hi>deſpondency</hi> attended the ſick from the firſt attack.</p>
            <p n="12">12. THE <hi>ſtrength</hi> was greatly <hi>proſtrated</hi> from the firſt attack.</p>
            <p n="13">13. THE <hi>pain</hi> in the <hi>head, loins, &amp;c.</hi> of which they had complained (V) before the attack, were greatly increaſed, and in ſome, the pain in the forehead was very acute and darting; but thoſe pains went generally off the ſecond day.</p>
            <p n="14">14. THE <hi>face</hi> was fluſhed, and the eyes were hot, inflamed and unable to bear much light.</p>
            <p n="15">15. ON the firſt day, many of them, at times, were a little <hi>delirious,</hi> but afterwards not until the receſs of the fever.</p>
            <p n="16">
               <pb n="292" facs="unknown:035302_0306_10021A68C8CD8270"/>
16. THE <hi>blood</hi> ſaved at venaeſection had not any inflammatory cruſt; in warm weather, it was florid like arterial blood, and continued in one ſoft homogeneous-like maſs, without any ſeparation of the <hi>ſerum</hi> after it was cold. When there was any ſeparation, the <hi>craſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum</hi> was of too lax a texture.</p>
            <p n="17">17. THE <hi>ſtools,</hi> after the firſt day, were fetid, inclined to a black colour, and were very rarely bilious, ſoft or liquid, excepting when forced by art; for an obſtinate coſtive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs attended the febrile ſtate.</p>
            <p n="18">18. THE <hi>urine</hi> was diſcharged in a large quantity, was pale, ſometimes limpid, and rarely of a higher than a ſtraw colour, except when the weather was very warm, and then it was more ſaturated, of a deep colour, and diſcharged in ſmaller quantities. It had a large cloud, except when it was very pale or limpid; but more generally it had a copious, white ſediment, even in the firſt day of the fever.</p>
            <p>ON the ſecond day, the urine continued to be diſcharged very copiouſly; in ſome, it
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:035302_0307_10021A6A5AF48B10"/>
was then turbid, and depoſited a more copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſediment, than on the firſt day; this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment was ſometimes of a browniſh colour; in which caſe it was generally followed by bloody urine, either about the end of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond or beginning of the third day. The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and quantity of the urine, diſcharged in equal times, were remarkably variable, being now limpid, then of a deeper colour, now diſcharged in a larger, then in a ſmaller quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, which could not be aſcribed to any change made either in the quantity or quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the drink, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VII. THE fever accompanied with thoſe (VI.) ſymptoms, terminated on the third day, or generally in leſs than 72 hours from the firſt attack, not by any aſſimulation, or coction and excretion of the morbid matter; for if by the latter, there would have been ſome critical diſcharge by ſweat, urine, ſtool, or otherwiſe, none of which happened; and if, by the former, nothing then would have remained but great debility. No; this fever did not terminate in either of theſe ſalutary ways, excepting in ſome, who were happy enough to have the diſeaſe conquered in the
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:035302_0308_10021A6BED07AA08"/>
beginning by proper evacuations, and by keeping up a plentiful ſweat, till the total ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the fever, by proper mild diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retics and diluents. But thoſe who had not that good fortune, however tranquil things might appear at this period, (as great debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and a little yellowneſs in the white of the eyes, ſeemed then to be the chief com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, excepting when the vomiting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued), yet the face of affairs was ſoon chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; for this period was ſoon ſucceeded by the ſecond <hi>ſtadium;</hi> a ſtate, though without any fever, much more terrible than the firſt: the ſymptoms in which were the following.</p>
            <p>VIII. 1. THE <hi>pulſe,</hi> immediately after the receſs of the fever, was very little more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent than in health, but hard and ſmall. However, tho' it continued ſmall, it became, ſoon afterwards, ſlower and very ſoft; and this ſoftneſs of the pulſe remained as long as the pulſe could be felt. In many, in this ſtage of the diſeaſe, the pulſe gradually ſubſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, until it became ſcarce perceptible; and this, notwithſtanding all the means uſed to ſupport and fill it; and when this was the caſe, the icteritious-like ſuffuſion, the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:035302_0309_10021A6E1DF7C0C0"/>
               <hi>delirium,</hi> reſtleſſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> increaſed to a great degree. In ſome, the pulſe, after being exceedingly ſmall and ſcarce percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, recovered conſiderably its fullneſs; but that favourable appearance was generally of but ſhort continuance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE <hi>heat</hi> did not exceed the natural animal heat; and when the pulſe ſubſided, the ſkin became cold, and the face, breaſt and extremities acquired ſomewhat of a livid co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE <hi>ſkin</hi> was dry when the weather was cold, but was moiſt and clammy when the weather was hot.</p>
            <p n="4">4. THE <hi>reſpiration</hi> was natural or rather ſlow.</p>
            <p n="5">5. THE <hi>tongue</hi> was moiſt and much clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than in the former (VI. 5.) ſtage, its tip and edges, as alſo the gums and lips, were of a more florid red colour than uſual.</p>
            <p n="6">6. VERY few complained of <hi>thirſt,</hi> though they had a great deſire for cold liquors.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="296" facs="unknown:035302_0310_10021A7055C12EF0"/>
7. THE <hi>vomiting</hi> or <hi>reaching</hi> to vomit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and in ſome was ſo conſtant, that neither medicines nor aliment of any kind were retained. Some vomited blood; others only what was laſt exhibited, mixed with phlegm; and others again had what is called the <hi>black vomit.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">That which is called the <hi>black vomit,</hi> at firſt ſight, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be black; but on a more careful examination, I obſerved, that this colour proceeded from a great quantity of ſmall, flakey, black ſubſtances which floated in the liquor thrown up by vomit; but the colour of this liquor was much the ſame with that which the patient had laſt drank, and was by no means black. Thoſe black flakey ſubſtances are the bile mixed with, or adhering to the <hi>mucus</hi> which lined the ſtomach. For, upon diſſection of thoſe who died of this diſeaſe, not only in this but former years, I always obſerved that the <hi>mucus</hi> of the ſtomach was abraded, and the bile in its <hi>cyſtis</hi> was black and ſometimes very viſcid. In a lad who died of this diſeaſe in the beginning of the fourth day, and who was immediately opened, the bile was not only black, but had the conſiſtence of thick <hi>Venice</hi>-tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine, and was exceedingly tough. On the inſide of the ſtomach, there were ſeveral carbuncles or gangrenous ſpecks. And in all thoſe I have diſſected, who have died of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, I have not only always obſerved the ſame, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that the blood was very fluid, and the veſſels of the <hi>viſcera</hi> much diſtended; from whence I have been very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to think, when the diſeaſe was not conquered in its firſt <hi>ſtadium,</hi> that, about the time of the termination of the fever, there was a <hi>metaſtaſis</hi> of the morbid matter to the <hi>viſcera.</hi>
               </note> The reaching to vomit
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:035302_0311_10021A72875526C8"/>
continued a longer or ſhorter time, according to the ſtate of the pulſe; for as that became fuller, and the heat greater, the reaching to vomit abated, and <hi>è contra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. THE inquietude was very obſtinate, and when they dozed, their ſlumbers were but ſhort and unrefreſhing. There were ſome who were drowſy; but theſe always awaked, after the ſhorteſt ſlumbers, with a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of ſpirits and ſtrength.</p>
            <p n="9">9. THE <hi>jactations</hi> or reſtleſsneſs was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing; it was frequently ſcarce poſſible to keep the patients in bed, though, at the ſame time, they did not complain of any anxiety or uneaſineſs; but if aſked how they did, the reply was, <hi>Very well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. THE <hi>debility</hi> was ſo great, that, if the patient was raiſed erect in the bed, or, in ſome, if the head was only raiſed from the pillow, while a cup of drink was given, the pulſe ſunk immediately, and became ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo ſmall, that it could ſcarcely be felt; at this time, they became cold, as in a <hi>hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripilatio,</hi> but without the anſerine-like ſkin:
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:035302_0312_10021A7419BC39F0"/>
their ſkin became clammy, the <hi>delirium</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, their lips and ſkin, eſpecially about the neck, face and extremities, together with their nails, acquired a livid colour.</p>
            <p n="11">11. THE <hi>delirium</hi> returned and increaſed; it was generally conſtant in thoſe whoſe pulſe was ſmall and ſubſiding.</p>
            <p n="12">12. THE inflammation of the <hi>tunica con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctiva</hi> or white of the eyes increaſed much, but without pain.</p>
            <p n="13">13. A <hi>yellowneſs</hi> in the white of the eyes, if it did not appear before in the febrile ſtate, became now very obſervable, and that icteritious-like colour was ſoon diffuſed over the whole ſurface of the body, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually acquiring a deeper ſaffron-like co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. In ſome indeed no yellowneſs was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, excepting in the white of the eyes, until a little before death, when it increaſed ſurpriſingly quick, eſpecially about the breaſt and neck.</p>
            <p n="14">14. THERE were many ſmall <hi>ſpecks,</hi> not raiſed above the ſkin, which appeared very
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:035302_0313_10021A7646CB5D58"/>
thick in the breaſt and neck; but leſs ſo in the extremities, and were of a ſcarlet, purple or livid colour.</p>
            <p n="15">15. IN women the <hi>menſtrua</hi> flowed, and ſometimes exceſſively, though not at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular periods.</p>
            <p n="16">16. THERE was ſuch a putrid diſſolution of the blood in this <hi>ſtadium</hi> of the diſeaſe, that, beſides the vomiting of blood former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mentioned, and the bloody urine ſoon to be taken notice of, there were <hi>haemorrhagies</hi> from the noſe, mouth, ears, eyes, and from the parts which were bliſtered with <hi>cantha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides.</hi> Nay, in the year 1739 or 1745, there was one or two inſtances of an haemorrhage from the ſkin, without any apparent punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or loſs of any part of the ſcarf-ſkin.</p>
            <p n="17">17. AN obſtinate <hi>coſtiveneſs</hi> continued in ſome; in others, the ſtools were frequent and looſe; in ſome, they were black, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid, large and greatly fatiguing; in others, when the ſtools were moderate, even though they were black, they gave great relief; in others again, the ſtools nearly reſembled tar
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:035302_0314_10021A7908582390"/>
in ſmoothneſs, tenacity, colour and conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
            <p n="18">18. THE <hi>urine</hi> was diſcharged in a large quantity, in proportion to the drink retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the patient: it was pale if the patient was not yellow; but if yellow, then it was of a deep-ſaffron colour; in either caſe it had a ſediment, or at leaſt a large cloud, which remained at the bottom of the glaſs; in ſome, it was very turbid, in others, it was bloody, and the quantity of blood diſcharged with the urine bore always ſome proportion to the ſtate of the pulſe; when that became fuller, the quantity of blood in the urine was diminiſhed: when the pulſe ſubſided, the bloody urine increaſed, and even returned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it had ceaſed ſome days, ſoon after the pulſe became ſmaller.</p>
            <p>THIS ſtage of the diſeaſe continued ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeven or eight days before the patient died.</p>
            <p>IX. WHEN this <hi>ſtadium</hi> (VIII.) of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe terminated in health, it was by a receſs or abatement of the vomiting, haemorrhagies,
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:035302_0315_10021A7A9ACCE2B8"/>
               <hi>delirium,</hi> inquietude, jactations, and icteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious-like ſuffuſion of the ſkin and white of the eyes; while, at the ſame time, the pulſe became fuller, and the patient gained ſtrength, which, after this diſeaſe, was very ſlowly.</p>
            <p>BUT when it terminated in death, thoſe (VIII.) ſymptoms not only continued, but ſooner or later increaſed in violence, and were ſucceeded with the following, which may be termed the <hi>third ſtadium</hi> of the diſeaſe, which quickly ended in death.</p>
            <p>X. THE pulſe tho' ſoft became exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſmall and unequal; the extremities grew cold, clammy and livid; the face and lips, in ſome, were fluſhed; in others, they were of a livid colour; the livid ſpecks increaſed ſo faſt, that in ſome, the whole breaſt and neck appeared livid; the heart palpitated ſtrongly; the heat about the <hi>praecordia</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed much; the reſpiration became diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, with frequent ſighing; the patient now became anxious, and extremely reſtleſs; the ſweat flowed from the face, neck and breaſt; blood flowed from the mouth, or
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:035302_0316_10021A7C2D307758"/>
noſe or ears, and in ſome, from all thoſe parts at once; the deglutition became diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult; the hiccoughs and <hi>ſubſultus</hi> of the tendons came on, and were frequent; the patients trifled with their fingers, and picked the naps of the bed-cloaths; they grew co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matous, or were conſtantly delirious. In this terrible ſtate, ſome continued eight, ten or twelve hours before they died, even after they had been ſo long ſpeechleſs, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any perceptible pulſation of the arteries in the wriſts; whereas, in all other acute diſeaſes, after the pulſe in the wriſts ceaſes, death follows immediately. When the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe was <hi>very</hi> acute, violent convulſions ſeized the unhappy patient, and quickly brought this <hi>ſtadium</hi> to its fatal end. After death, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid blotches increaſed faſt, eſpecially about the face, breaſt, and neck, and the putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction began very early, or rather increaſed very quickly.</p>
            <p>XI. THIS was the progreſs of this terrible diſeaſe through its ſeveral <hi>ſtadia.</hi> But in hot weather, and when the ſymptoms in the firſt ſtage were very violent, it paſſed thro' thoſe ſtages, as Dr. <hi>Warren</hi> has likewiſe obſerved,
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:035302_0317_10021A7DCA172528"/>
with ſuch precipitation, that there was but little opportunity of diſtinguiſhing its diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>ſtadia;</hi> the whole tragedy having been finiſhed in leſs than 48 hours.</p>
            <p>XII. IT was remarkable, that, 1. The infection was increaſed by warm and leſſened by cold weather. 2. The ſymptoms in the ſeveral <hi>ſtadia</hi> were more or leſs violent, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the heat or coolneſs of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In hot days, the ſymptoms were not only more violent, but in thoſe who ſeemed, in moderate weather, to be on the recovery, or at leaſt in no danger, the ſymptoms were all ſo greatly heightened, when the weather grew conſiderably warmer, as frequently to become fatal. In cool days, the ſymptoms were not only milder, but many, who were apparently in great danger in hot days, were ſaved from the very jaws of death by the weather becoming happily cooler. 3. The diſeaſe was generally more fatal to thoſe who lay in ſmall chambers not conveniently ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated for the admiſſion of freſh air, to thoſe of an athletic and full habit, to ſtrangers who were natives of a cold climate to thoſe who had the greateſt dread of it, and to
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:035302_0318_10021A808C480EE8"/>
thoſe, who, before the attack of the diſeaſe, had overheated themſelves by exerciſe in the ſun, or by exceſſive drinking of ſtrong li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors; either of which indeed ſeemed to render the body more ſuſceptible of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Laſtly, the diſeaſe proved moſt certainly fatal to valetudinarians, or to thoſe who had been weakened by any previous diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>XIII. THE <hi>prognoſtics</hi> in the firſt <hi>ſtadium</hi> are theſe. 1. The more acute and conſtant the pains are in the head, loins, knees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the more the eyes are inflamed; the greater their inability is to bear light, and the more the face is fluſhed at the firſt attack, the fever and all the ſymptoms (VI.) in the firſt <hi>ſtadium</hi> will be the more violent. 2. The more intenſe the ſymptoms are in the firſt ſtate, the ſooner will the fever terminate. 3. The ſooner the diſeaſe runs thro' the firſt <hi>ſtadium,</hi> the ſhorter will be the duration of the ſecond, and <hi>è contra.</hi> 4. The ſhorter the duration is of the firſt, the greater and more certain is the danger in the ſecond ſtate. For when the fever terminated before the beginning of the third day, death ſeemed
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:035302_0319_10021A82B854E600"/>
inevitably to be the conſequence, as there was then no poſſibility of ſupporting the pulſe, and as all the bad ſymptoms were then hurried on with ſuch precipitation, that the patient generally died before the end of the fifth day, excepting a conſiderable cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the weather happily intervened; but on the contrary, it was a favourable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance when the fever was protracted to the end of the third day, without any remarkable hardneſs or depreſſion of the pulſe. 5. A great depreſſion of the pulſe, about the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the fever, is bad, ſince, from that circumſtance, the vomitings, inceſſant jactations, the coldneſs and lividneſs of the extremities, haemorrhagies, <hi>delirium, &amp;c.</hi> are uſhered in with ſurpriſing celerity. 6. The more the ſtrength is proſtrated from the firſt attack, the greater is the danger. 7. A vomiting coming on early in the diſeaſe, and continuing or increaſing, is bad, and generally preſages the <hi>black vomit.</hi> 8. A ſediment in the urine in the firſt and ſecond day of the diſeaſe is bad, and the more copious the ſediment is, the greater is the danger.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="306" facs="unknown:035302_0320_10021A846DBB0030"/>
XIV. THE prognoſtics in the ſecond <hi>ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> are theſe: 1. An early yellowneſs in the white of the eyes is bad: when it is obſervable about the end of the ſecond day, in the firſt <hi>ſtadium,</hi> the patient generally dies about the beginning of the fourth day from the firſt attack of the diſeaſe. But when the yellowneſs does not appear till the end of the third day, if the patient does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, the diſeaſe ſometimes continues to the 9th or 10th day of the ſecond <hi>ſtadium</hi> before the patient dies. When the yellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſkin and eyes increaſes faſt and acquires ſoon a deep icteritious-like colour, the greateſt danger is to be apprehended. 2. If the inflammation of the white of the eyes increaſes, it is bad. 3. The more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed and bloody-like the ſkin is where it has been bliſtered, the greater is the danger. 4. If the vomiting continues or increaſes, it is bad, but the <hi>black vomiting</hi> is generally mortal. 5. When the pulſe varies frequently in its fullneſs, being ſometimes ſmall, then fuller, it is bad. But there was leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence to be had on the pulſe in this than is common in other diſeaſes; for in ſome patients, in the ſecond ſtage of the diſeaſe,
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:035302_0321_10021A86081D1660"/>
even within a few hours of their death, the pulſe, with reſpect to its fullneſs, ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, equality and frequency, has continued like that of one in perfect health, although, from the other ſymptoms, the death of the patient could be foretold with great cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty. 6. The more the ſtrength of the patient is reduced in the firſt, the greater is the danger in the ſecond <hi>ſtadium.</hi> 7. Great reſtleſſneſs, inquietude, an early <hi>delirium</hi> and a continuation of it are very bad. 8. Livid blotches about the neck and breaſt, a livid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the lips and nails fluſshing of the face, or a livid colour thereof, are ſure ſigns of the quick approach of death. 9. Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent looſe ſtools, which give not any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief are bad, and ſooner they ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly happen, the greater is the danger: but those which are black, and continue ſo without any abatement of the ſymptoms, are generally mortal. 10. Bloody urine and all haemorrhagies, excepting flight ones from the noſe, are bad; and more copious they are, the greater is the danger. But a flux of the <hi>menſes,</hi> though not at their regular period, if attended with an abatement of the ſymptoms, is a favourable circumſtance,
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:035302_0322_10021A8966129CD0"/>
otherwiſe it is bad. 11. A ſuppreſſion of urine, eſpecially in thoſe, who, in the courſe of the diſeaſe, have had large diſcharges that way, is a certain ſign of the quick approach of death.</p>
            <p>XV. As to the prognoſtics in the third (X) <hi>ſtadium,</hi> it is ſufficient to ſay,
