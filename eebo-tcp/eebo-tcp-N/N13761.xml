         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It is the duty of the people, therefore, in framing a conſtitution of government, to provide for an equitable mode of making laws, as well as for an impartial interpretation, and a faithful execution of them; that every man may, at all times, find his ſecurity in them.</p>

                     <pb n="8" facs="unknown:017390_0008_0FA111BE4E20CE58"/>We, therefore, the people of Maſſachuſetts, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, with grateful hearts, the goodneſs of the Great Legiſlator of the Univerſe, in affording us, in the courſe of his providence, an opportunity, deliberately, and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, without fraud, violence, or ſurprize, of entering into an original, explicit, and ſolemn compact with each other; and of forming a new conſtitution of civil government, for ourſelves and poſterity; and devoutly imploring his direction in ſo intereſting a deſign, DO agree upon, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, and eſtabliſh, the following <hi>Declaration of Rights,</hi> and <hi>Frame of Government,</hi> as the CONSTITUTION <hi>of the</hi> COMMONWEALTH <hi>of</hi> MASSACHUSETTS.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Art.</hi> I. ALL men are born free and equal, and have certain natural, eſſential, and unalienable rights; among which may be reckoned the right of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and defending their lives and liberties; that of acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, poſſeſſing, and protecting property; in fine, that of ſeeking and obtaining their ſafety and happineſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. It is the right as well as the duty of all men in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, publicly, and at ſtated ſeaſons, to worſhip the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being, thd great Creator and Preſerver of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. And no ſubject ſhall be hurt, moleſted, or reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his perſon, liberty, or eſtate, for worſhipping God in the manner and ſeaſon moſt agreeable to the dictates of his own conſcience; or for his religious profeſſion or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents; provided he doth not diſturb the public peace, or obſtruct others in their religious worſhip.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. As the happineſs of a people, and the good order and preſervation of civil government, eſſentially depend upon piety, religion, and morality; and as theſe cannot be generally diffuſed through a community, but by the inſtitution of the public worſhip of God, and of public
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:017390_0009_0FA111C064E52120"/>
inſtructions in piety, religion and morality: Therefore, to promote their happineſs, and to ſecure the good order and preſervation of their government, the people of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth have a right to inveſt their legiſlature with power to authoriſe and require, and the legiſlature ſhall, from time to time, authoriſe and require the ſeveral towns, pariſhes, precincts, and other bodies-politic, or religious ſocieties, to make ſuitable proviſion, at their own expence, for the inſtitution of the public worſhip of God, and for the ſupport and maintenance of public proteſtant teachers of piety, religion, and morality, in all caſes where ſuch proviſion ſhall not be made voluntarily.</p>
                  <p>And the people of this commonwealth, have alſo a right to, and do, inveſt their legiſlature with authority to enjoin, upon all the ſubjects, an attendance upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of the public teachers as aforeſaid, at ſtated times and ſeaſons, if there be any on whoſe inſtructions they can conſcientiouſly and conveniently attend.</p>
                  <p>Provided notwithſtanding, that the ſeveral towns, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, precincts, and other bodies-politic, or religious ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, ſhall, at all times, have the excluſive right of elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their public teachers, and of contracting with them for their ſupport and maintenance.</p>
                  <p>And all monies paid by the ſubject to the ſupport of public worſhip, and of the public teachers aforeſaid, ſhall, if he require it, be uniformly applied to the ſupport of the public teacher or teachers of his own religious ſect or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, provided there be any on whoſe inſtructions he attends; otherwiſe it may be paid towards the ſupport of the teacher or teachers of the pariſh or precinct in which the ſaid monies are raiſed.</p>
                  <p>And every denomination of Chriſtians demeaning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves peaceably, and as good ſubjects of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, ſhall be equally under the protection of the law: And no ſubordination of any one ſect or denomination to another, ſhall ever be eſtabliſhed by law.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. The people of this commonwealth have the ſole and excluſive right of governing themſelves as a free, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, and independent ſtate; and do, and forever here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after

                     </gap> to the United States of America, in Congreſs aſſembled.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. All power reſiding originally in the people, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing derived from them, the ſeveral magiſtrates and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of government, veſted with authority, whether legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative, executive, or judicial, are their ſubſtitutes and agents, and are at all times accountable to them.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. No man, or corporation, or aſſociation of men, have any other title to obtain advantages, or particular and excluſive privileges, diſtinct from thoſe of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, than what ariſes from the conſideration of ſervices rendered to the public; and this title being in nature nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hereditary nor tranſmiſſible to children, or deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, or relations by blood, the idea of a man born a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, lawgiver, or judge, is abſurd and unnatural.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. Government is inſtituted for the common good; for the protection, ſafety, proſperity, and happineſs of the people; and not for the profit, honour, or private inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of any one man, family, or claſs of men: Therefore, the people alone have an inconteſtible, unalienable, and indefeaſible right, to inſtitute government; and to reform, alter, or totally change the ſame, when their protection, ſafety, proſperity, and happineſs require it.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. In order to prevent thoſe, who are veſted with authority from becoming oppreſſors, the people have a right, at ſuch periods, and in ſuch manner as they ſhall eſtabliſh by their frame of government, to cauſe their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic officers to return to private life; and to fill up vacant places, by certain and regular elections and appointments.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. All elections ought to be free, and all the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of this commonwealth, having ſuch qualifications as they ſhall eſtabliſh by their frame of government, have an equal right to elect officers, and to be elected for public employments.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. Each individual of the ſociety has a right to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by it, in the enjoyment of his life, liberty, and property, according to ſtanding laws. He is obliged,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:017390_0011_0FA111C1E047B7B8"/>
conſequently, to contribute his ſhare to the expence of this protection; to give his perſonal ſervice, or an equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, when neceſſary: But no part of the property of any individual, can, with juſtice, be taken from him, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to public uſes, without his own conſent, or that of the repreſentative body of the people: In fine, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this commonwealth are not controulable by any other laws, than thoſe to which their conſtitutional repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative body have given their conſent. And whenever the public exigences require, that the property of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual ſhould be appropriated to public uſes, he ſhall receive a reaſonable compenſation therefor.</p>
                  <p n="11">XI. Every ſubject of the commonwealth ought to find a certain remedy, by having recourſe to the laws for all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries or wrongs which he may receive in his perſon, property or character. He ought to obtain right and juſtice freely, and without being obliged to purchaſe it; compleatly, and without any denial; promptly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay; conformably to the laws.</p>
                  <p n="12">XII. No ſubject ſhall be held to anſwer for any crime or offence, until the ſame is fully and plainly, ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and formally, deſcribed to him; or be compelled to accuſe, or furniſh evidence againſt himſelf. And every ſubject ſhall have a right to produce all proofs that may be favourable to him; to meet the witneſſes againſt him face to face, and to be fully heard in his defence by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or his council, at his election. And no ſubject ſhall be arreſted, impriſoned, deſpoiled, or deprived of his property, immunities, or privileges, put out of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the law, exiled, or deprived of his life, liberty, or eſtate, but by the judgment of his peers, or the law of the land.</p>
                  <p>And the legiſlature ſhall not make any law, that ſhall ſubject any perſon to a capital or infamous puniſhment, excepting for the government of the army and navy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trial by jury.</p>
                  <p n="13">XIII. In criminal proſecutions, the verification of facts in the vicinity where they happen, is one of the greateſt ſecurities of the life, liberty, and property of the citizen.</p>
                  <p n="14">
                     <pb n="12" facs="unknown:017390_0012_0FA111C20A6C0F70"/>XIV. Every ſubject has a right to be ſecure from all unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſearches, and ſeizures, of his perſon, his houſes, his papers, and all his poſſeſſions. All warrants, therefore, are contrary to this right, if the cauſe or foundation of them be not previouſly ſupported by oath or affirmation; and if the order in a warrant to a civil officer, to make ſearch in all ſuſpected places, or to arreſt one or more ſuſpected perſons, or to ſeize their property, be not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a ſpecial deſignation of the perſons or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of ſearch, arreſt, or ſeizure; and no warrant ought to be iſſued, but in caſes and with the formalities pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the laws.</p>
                  <p n="15">XV. In all controverſies concerning property, and in all ſuits between two or more perſons, except in caſes in which it has heretofore been otherways uſed and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, the parties have a right to a trial by a jury; and this method of procedure ſhall be held ſacred, unleſs, in cauſes ariſing on the high ſeas, and ſuch as relate to mariners wages, the legiſlature ſhall hereafter find it neceſſary to alter it.</p>
                  <p n="16">XVI. The liberty of the preſs is eſſential to the ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of freedom in a ſtate; it ought not, therefore, to be reſtrained in this commonwealth.</p>
                  <p n="17">XVII. The people have a right to keep and to bear arms for the common defence. And as in time of peace armies are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be maintained without the conſent of the legiſlature, and the military power ſhall always be held in exact ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the civil authority, and be governed by it.</p>
                  <p n="18">XVIII. A frequent recurrence to the fundamental prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the conſtitution, and a conſtant adherence to thoſe of piety, juſtice, moderation, temperance, induſtry, and frugality, are abſolutely neceſſary, to preſerve the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of liberty, and to maintain a free government. The people ought, conſequently, to have a particular at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to all thoſe principles, in the choice of their offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and repreſentatives: And they have a right to require of their lawgivers and magiſtrates, an exact and conſtant obſervance of them, in the formation and execution of all
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:017390_0013_0FA111C2CB0F7778"/>
laws neceſſary for the good adminiſtration of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
                  <p n="19">XIX. The people have a right, in an orderly and peaceable manner, to aſſemble to conſult upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good; give inſtructions to their repreſentatives; and to requeſt of the legiſlative body, by the way of addreſſes, petitions, or remonſtrances, redreſs of the wrongs done them, and of the grievances they ſuffer.</p>
                  <p n="20">XX. The power of ſuſpending the laws, or the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the laws, ought never to be exerciſed but by the legiſlature, or by authority derived from it, to be exerciſed in ſuch particular caſes only as the legiſlature ſhall expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provide for.</p>
                  <p n="21">XXI. The freedom of deliberation, ſpeech, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, in either houſe of the legiſlature, is ſo eſſential to the rights of the people, that it cannot be the foundation of any accuſation or proſecution, action, or complaint, in any other court or place whatſoever.</p>
                  <p n="22">XXII. The legiſlature ought frequently to aſſemble for the redreſs of grievances, for correcting, ſtrengthening, and confirming the laws, and for making new laws, as the common good may require.</p>
                  <p n="23">XXIII. No ſubſidy, charge, tax, impoſt, or duties, ought to be eſtabliſhed, fixed, laid, or levied, under any pretext whatſoever, without the conſent of the people, or their repreſentatives in the legiſlature.</p>
                  <p n="24">XXIV. Laws made to puniſh for actions done before the exiſtence of ſuch laws, and which have not been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared crimes by preceding laws, are unjuſt, oppreſſive, and inconſiſtent with the fundamental principles of a free government.</p>
                  <p n="15">XXV. No ſubject ought, in any caſe, or in any time, to be declared guilty of treaſon or felony by the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p n="26">XXVI. No magiſtrate or court of law ſhall demand exceſſive bail or ſureties, impoſe exceſſive fines, or inflict cruel or unuſual puniſhments.</p>
                  <p n="27">XXVII. In time of peace, no ſoldier ought to be quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in any houſe without the conſent of the owner; and
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:017390_0014_0FA111C3898DDCA0"/>
in time of war, ſuch quarters ought not to be made, but by the civil magiſtrate, in a manner ordained by the legiſlature.</p>
                  <p n="28">XXVIII. No perſon can in any caſe be ſubjected to law-martial, or to any penalties or pains, by virtue of that law, except thoſe employed in the army or navy, and except the militia in actual ſervice, but by authority of the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature.</p>
                  <p n="29">XXIX. It is eſſential to the preſervation of the rights of every individual, his life, liberty, property, and character, that there be an impartial interpretation of the laws, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of juſtice. It is the right of every citizen to be tried by judges as free, impartial, and independent, as the lot of humanity will admit. It is, therefore, not only the beſt policy, but for the ſecurity of the rights of the people, and of every citizen, that the judges of the ſupreme judicial court ſhould hold their offices as long as they behave themſelves well; and that they ſhould have honourable ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laries, aſcertained and eſtabliſhed by ſtanding laws.</p>
                  <p n="30">XXX. In the government of this Commonwealth, the legiſlative department ſhall never exerciſe the executive and judicial powers, or either of them: The executive ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver exerciſe the legiſlative and judicial powers, or either of them: The judicial ſhall never exerciſe the legiſlative and executive powers, or either of them: to the end, it may be a government of laws, and not of men.</p>

No bill or reſolve of the ſenate or houſe of repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives ſhall become a law, and have force as ſuch, until it ſhall have been laid before the governor for his reviſal: And if he, upon ſuch reviſion, approve thereof, he ſhall ſignify his approbation by ſigning the ſame.

                     <p n="3">III.

               <p>[Since the commencement of hoſtilities by Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, the ſtate of Rhode-Iſland and Providence plantations has not aſſumed a form of government different from that contained in the foregoing charter. For in that, the king ceded to the governor and company, all powers, legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, executive, and judicial, reſerving to himſelf, as an acknowledgement of his ſovereignty, a render of the fifth part of the gold and ſilver ore that ſhould be found with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the territory. The governor, chief magiſtrates, and legiſlators are choſen by the freemen as uſual, and all ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial and executive officers are annually elected by the governor and company, or upper and lower houſe of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly. All proceſſes original and judicial, formerly iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued in the king's name, but they now iſſue in the name of the governor and company. The oaths of allegiance and of office are made conformable to the principles of the revolution. The governor, in his legiſlative capacity, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give a negative to any act of the two houſes; but, in common with the other magiſtrates, has one voice only.</p>
               <p>The ſtate is divided into five counties, in each of which there is a court of common pleas and general ſeſſions of the peace, held twice every year, for the trial of all cauſes not capital, that ariſe within their limits; from which an appeal lies, to the ſuperior court of judicature, court of aſſize and general jail delivery, whoſe juriſdiction extends over the whole ſtate, and who alſo ſit twice a year in each county. The conſtitution admits not of religious eſtabliſhments, any farther than depends upon the voluntary choice of individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als. All men profeſſing one Supreme Being, are equally protected by the laws, and no particular ſect can claim pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence: From hence it is, that benevolence, hoſpitality, and undiſſembled honeſty remarkably characteriſe the people.]</p>

               </head>
               <p>CONNECTICUT is divided into ſix counties, and each county is divided into a number of towns. Each town has a right to ſend two repreſentatives to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral court or aſſembly. The general court conſiſts of two branches called the upper and lower houſe. The upper houſe is compoſed of the governor, deputy-governor, and twelve aſſiſtants or counſellors; and the lower houſe of the repreſentatives of the ſeveral towns. This court has the ſole power to make and repeal laws, grant levies, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of lands belonging to the ſtate, to particular towns and perſons: to erect and ſtile judicatories and officers, as they ſhall ſee neceſſary for the good government of the people; and alſo to call to account any court, magiſtrate, or other officer, for any miſdemeanor or mal-adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and for juſt cauſe may fine, diſplace, or remove them, or deal otherwiſe, as the nature of the caſe ſhall require; and deal or act in any other matter that concerns the good of the ſtate, except the election of governor, deputy-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, aſſiſtants, treaſurer, and ſecretary, which ſhall be done by the freemen at the yearly court of election, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there be any vacancy by reaſon of death or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, after the election, which may be filled up by the general court. This court has power alſo, for reaſons ſatisfactory to them, to grant ſuſpenſion, releaſe, and jail delivery upon reprieve, in capital and criminal caſes. The general court has two ſtated ſeſſions annually, on the ſecond Thurſdays of May and October.</p>
               <p>The governor, or in his abſence the deputy-governor, may call the aſſembly, on ſpecial emergencies, to meet
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:017390_0060_0FA111FAC1921D68"/>
at any other time. The governor, deputy-governor, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants, and ſecretary, are annually elected on the ſecond Thurſday in May. The repreſentatives are newly cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen for each ſtated ſeſſion. The judges and juſtices are annually appointed by the general court; the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are commonly re-appointed from time to time during their capacity to ſerve, unleſs guilty of miſbehaviour. The ſheriffs are appointed by the governor and council, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out limitation of time, but may be ſuperſeded by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority that appoints them. The governor for the time being is captain general of the militia; the deputy-gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, lieutenant-general; the other general officers, and the held officers are appointed by the general court, and commiſſioned by the governor. The captains and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterns are choſen by the vote of the company and houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ng within the limits of the company; the perſon ſo choſen muſt be approved by the general court, and commiſſioned by the governor, before they have power to execute their offices. All the military officers hold their offices during the pleaſure of the aſſembly, nor can they reſign their commiſſions without leave of the captain-general, under penalty of doing duty in the ranks as private ſoldiers.</p>
               <p>The mode of electing the governor, deputy-governor, aſſiſtants, treaſurer, and ſecretary is, that the freemen in the ſeveral towns meet on the Monday next after the firſt Tueſday in April annually (being the day appointed by law for that purpoſe, and chooſing repreſentatives) and give in their votes for the perſons they chooſe for ſaid of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices reſpectively, with their names written on a piece of paper, which votes are received and ſealed up by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable in the freemen's meeting; the votes for each of ſaid offices in a different paper, writing on the outſide the name of the town, and the office for which the votes are given in, which are ſent by the repreſentativss to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral court, to be held on the ſecond Thurſday of May next enſuing; at which time, after the houſe of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives have choſen a ſpeaker and clerk, a committee is choſen of members of both houſes, to ſort and count the
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:017390_0061_0FA111FB08536C88"/>
votes, and declare the names of the perſons choſen to ſaid offices. Any freemen qualified to vote for repreſentatives, &amp;c. may be elected to any office in the government. In chooſing aſſiſtants twenty perſons are nominated by the votes of the freemen, given in at their meeting for chooſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repreſentatives in September annually, and ſealed up and ſent to the general court in October then next, which are counted by a committee of both houſes, and the twenty perſons who have the greateſt number of votes ſtand in nomination, out of which number twelve are to be choſen aſſiſtants by the freemen, the next April, in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner afore deſcribed.</p>
               <p>The qualifications requiſite to entitle a perſon to vote in election of the officers of government are, maturity in years, quiet and peaceable behaviour, a civil converſation, and forty ſhillings freehold, or forty pounds perſonal eſtate; if the ſelectmen of the town certify a perſon qualified in thoſe reſpects, he is admitted a freemen, on his taking an oath of fidelity to the ſtate.</p>
               <p>The names of all that are thus admitted, are inrolled in the town-clerk's office, and continue freemen during life, unleſs disfranchiſed by a ſentence of the ſuperior court on conviction of a miſdemeanour.</p>
               <p>The governor or in his abſence the deputy governor in the upper houſe, and the ſpeaker in the lower houſe of aſſembly, have a caſting voice when the members of the reſpective houſes, including the governor and ſpeaker, are equally divided in opinion on any queſtion.</p>
               <p>There is in this ſtate a ſuperior court, conſiſting of one chief judge and four other judges, which have authority in all criminal caſes, extending to life, limb, and baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to hear and determine all civil actions brought by appeal from the county courts, or on writs of error. This court alſo hath authority in all matters of divorce. There are two ſtated ſeſſions of the ſuperior court in each county annually.</p>
               <p>There are alſo county courts held in the ſeveral coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, conſiſting of one judge and four juſtices of the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, who have juriſdiction in all criminal caſes, ariſing
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:017390_0062_0FA111FBD9B09190"/>
within their reſpective counties, where the puniſhment does not extend to life, limb, or baniſhment. The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty courts alſo have original juriſdiction in all civil actions wherein the demand exceeds forty ſhillings.</p>
               <p>The ſuperior and county courts try matters of fact by a jury, according to the courſe of the common law.</p>
               <p>Juſtices of the peace have authority to hear and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine civil actions where the demand does not exceed forty ſhillings. They alſo have authority in ſome caſes of a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal nature, puniſhable by fine not exceeding forty ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, or whipping not exceeding ten ſtripes, or ſitting in the ſtocks.</p>
               <p>This ſtate is alſo divided into a number of probate diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricts, leſs than counties; in each of which is appointed a judge for the probate of wills, granting adminiſtration on inteſtate eſtates, appointing guardians for minors, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering diſtribution of inteſtate eſtates, &amp;c. An appeal lies from any decree of this court to the ſuperior court.</p>
               <p>The ſuperior, county, and probate courts appoint their reſpective clerks.</p>
               <p>The general court has till very lately been the only court of chancery in this ſtate. But by a late law, the county courts determine matters of equity from five pounds to two hundred pounds value; the ſuperior court from two hundred to eight hundred pounds value; and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral aſſembly all caſes exceeding the laſt mentioned ſum.</p>
               <p>All attornies at law are admitted and ſworn by the county courts; there is no attorney general, but there uſed to be one king's attorney in each county, but ſince the king has abdicated the government, they are now at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tornies to the governor and company.</p>

the number of their reſpective electors; ſo that the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the good people of this ſtate, both in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and aſſembly, ſhall for ever remain proportionate and adequate.</p>
               <p n="17">17. And this convention doth further, in the name and by the authority of the good people of this ſtate, ordain, determine, and declare, that the ſupreme executive power and authority of this ſtate ſhall be veſted in a governor; and that ſtatedly once in every three years, and as often as the ſeat of government ſhall become vacant, a wiſe and diſcreet freeholder of this ſtate ſhall be by ballot elected governor, by the freeholders of this ſtate, qualified as before deſcribed to elect ſenators; which elections ſhall be always held at the times and places of chooſing repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives in aſſembly for each reſpective county; and that the perſon who hath the greateſt number of votes within the ſaid ſtate, ſhall be governor thereof.</p>

Provided, that where the governor ſhall, with the conſent of the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature, be out of the ſtate, in time of war, at the head of a military force thereof, he ſhall ſtill continue in his command of all the military force of the ſtate, both by ſea and land.</p>

But the party ſo convicted, ſhall be, nevertheleſs, liable and ſubject to indictment, trial, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and puniſhment, according to the laws of the land.</p>
               <p n="34">34. And it is further ordained, that in every trial on im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment

               <p n="35">35. And this convention doth further, in the name and by the authority of the good people of this ſtate, ordain, determine, and declare, that ſuch parts of the common law of England, and of the ſtatute law of England and Great-Britain, and of the acts of the legiſlature of the colony of New-York, as together did form the law of the ſaid colony on the 19th day of April, in the year of our Lord one thouſand ſeven hundred and ſeventy-five, ſhall be and continue the law of this ſtate; ſubject to ſuch alterations and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as the legiſlature of this ſtate ſhall, from time to time make concerning the ſame. That ſuch of the ſaid acts as are temporary, ſhall expire at the times limited for their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration reſpectively. That all ſuch parts of the ſaid common law, and all ſuch of the ſaid ſtatutes, and acts aforeſaid, or parts thereof, as may be conſtrued to eſtabliſh or maintain any partiticular denomination of chriſtians or their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, or concern the allegiance heretofore yielded to, and the ſupremacy, ſovereignty, government, or prerogatives, claimed or exerciſed by the king of Great-Britain and his predeceſſors, over the colony of New-York and its inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, or are repugnant to this conſtitution, be, and they hereby are, abrogated and rejected.

               <p n="36">36. And be it further ordained, that all grants of land within this ſtate, made by the king of Great-Britain, or perſons acting under his authority, after the fourteenth day of October, one thouſand ſeven hundred and ſeventy-five, ſhall be null and void: But that nothing in this conſtitution contained, ſhall be conſtrued to affect any grants of land,

And that none of the ſaid charters ſhall be adjudged to be void, by reaſon of any non-uſer or miſ-uſer of any of their reſpective rights or privileges, between the nineteenth day of April, in the year of our Lord one thouſand ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſeventy-five, and the publication of this conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And further, that all ſuch of the officers deſcribed in the ſaid charters reſpectively, as by the terms of the ſaid charters, were to be appointed by the governor of the colony of New-York, with or without the advice and conſent of the council of the ſaid king, in the ſaid colony, ſhall henceforth be appointed by the council eſtabliſhed by this conſtitution, for the appointment of officers in this ſtate, until otherwiſe directed by the legiſlature.</p>
               <p n="37">37. And whereas it is of great importance to the ſafety of this ſtate, that peace and amity with the indians within the ſame, be at all times ſupported and maintained. And whereas, the frauds too often practiſed towards the ſaid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, in contracts made for their lands, have in divers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances been productive of dangerous diſcontents and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities; Be it ordained, that no purchaſes or contracts for the ſale of lands made ſince the fourteenth day of October, in the year of our Lord one thouſand ſeven hundred and ſeventy-five, or which may hereafter be made with or of the ſaid indians, within the limits of this ſtate, ſhall be binding on the ſaid indians, or deemed valid, unleſs made under the authority, and with the conſent of the legiſlature of this ſtate.</p>
               <p n="38">38. And whereas we are required by the benevolent principles of rational liberty, not only to expel civil tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but alſo to guard againſt that ſpiritual oppreſſion and intolerance, wherewith the bigotry and ambition of weak and wicked prieſts and princes, have ſcourged mankind: This convention doth further, in the name and by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the good people of this ſtate, ordain, determine and declare, that the free exerciſe and enjoyment of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous profeſſion and worſhip, without diſcrimination or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,

               <p n="39">39. And whereas the miniſters of the goſpel, are by their profeſſion dedicated to the ſervice of God and the cure of ſouls, and ought not to be diverted from the great du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their function; therefore no miniſter of the goſpel, or prieſt of any denomination whatſoever, ſhall at any time hereafter, under any pretence or deſcription whatever, be eligible to, or capable of holding any civil or military of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice or place, within this ſtate.</p>

And whereas it is of the utmoſt importance to the ſafety of every ſtate, that it ſhould always be in a condition of defence; and it is the duty of every man, who enjoys the protection of ſociety, to be prepared and willing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it; this convention, therefore, in the name and by the authority of the good people of this ſtate, doth ordain, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine and declare, that the militia of this ſtate, at all times hereafter, as well in peace as in war, ſhall be armed and diſciplined, and in readineſs for ſervice. That all ſuch of the inhabitants of this ſtate, being of the people called Quakers, from ſcruples of conſcience, may be averſe to the bearing of arms, be therefrom excuſed by the legiſlature; and do pay to the ſtate, ſuch ſums of money in lieu of their perſonal ſervice, as the ſame may, in the judgment of the legiſlature, be worth: And that a proper magazine of warlike ſtores, proportionate to the number of inhabitants, be, forever hereafter, at the expence of this ſtate, and by acts of the legiſlature, eſtabliſhed, maintained, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in every county in this ſtate.</p>

And this convention doth further ordain, determine and declare, in the name and by the authority of the good people of this ſtate, that trial by jury, in all caſes in which it hath heretofore been uſed in the colony of New-York, ſhall be eſtabliſhed, and remain inviolate forever. And that no acts of attainder ſhall be paſſed by the legiſlature of this ſtate for crimes, other than thoſe committed before the

                  </head>
                  <p>THE parliament of Great-Britain, by a declaratory act, having aſſumed a right to make laws to bind the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies in all caſes whatſoever, and in purſuance of ſuch claim endeavoured by force of arms to ſubjugate the united colonies to an unconditional ſubmiſſion to their will and power, and having at length conſtrained them to declare themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent ſtates, and to aſſume government under the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the people. Therefore, we, the delegates of Maryland, in free and full convention aſſembled, taking into our moſt ſerious conſideration the beſt means of eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing a good conſtitution in this ſtate, for the ſure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and more permanent ſecurity thereof, declare,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That all government of right originates from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is founded in compact only, and inſtituted ſolely for the good of the whole.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 That the people of this ſtate ought to have the ſole and excluſive right of regulating the internal government and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice thereof.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the inhabitants of Maryland are entitled to the common law of England, and the trial by jury, according to the courſe of that law, and to the benefit of ſuch of the Engliſh ſtatutes, as exiſted at the time of their firſt emigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and which by experience have been found applicable
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:017390_0117_0FA1113E06B3FCF8"/>
to their local and other circumſtances, and of ſuch others as have been ſince made in England, or Great-Britain, and have been introduced, uſed, and practiſed, by the courts of law or equity; and alſo to all acts of aſſembly in force on the firſt of June ſeventeen hundred and ſeventy-four, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſuch as may have ſince expired, or have been, or may be altered by acts of convention, or this declaration of rights, ſubject nevertheleſs to the reviſion of, and amendment or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal by, the legiſlature of this ſtate; and the inhabitants of Maryland are alſo entitled to all property derived to them from or under the charter granted by his majeſty Charles I. to Caecilius Calvert, baron of Baltimore.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That all perſons inveſted with the legiſlative or exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive powers of government are the truſtees of the public, and as ſuch accountable for their conduct: wherefore, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the ends of government are perverted, and public li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty manifeſtly endangered, and all other means of redreſs are ineffectual, the people may, and of right ought, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the old or eſtabliſh a new government; the doctrine of non-reſiſtance againſt arbitrary power and oppreſſion, is abſurd, ſlaviſh, and deſtructive of the good and happineſs of mankind.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That the right in the people to participate in the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature is the beſt ſecurity of liberty, and the foundation of all free government; for this purpoſe, elections ought to be free and frequent, and every man having property in, a common intereſt with, and attachment to the community, ought to have a right of ſuffrage.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That the legiſlative, executive, and judicial powers of government, ought to be forever ſeparate and diſtinct from each other.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. That no power of ſuſpending laws, or the execution of laws, unleſs by, or derived from the legiſlature, ought to be exerciſed or allowed.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. That freedom of ſpeech and debates, or proceedings in the legiſlature, ought not to be impeached in any other court or judicature.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. That a place for the meeting of the legiſlature ought to be fixed, the moſt convenient to the members thereof,
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:017390_0118_0FA1113EC6ECB098"/>
and to the depoſitory of public records, and the legiſlature ought not to be convened or held at any other place, but from evident neceſſity.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. That for redreſs of grievances, and for amending, ſtrengthening and preſerving the laws, the legiſlature ought to be frequently convened.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. That every man hath a right to petition the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for the redreſs of grievances, in a peaceable and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manner.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. That no aid, charge, tax, fee or fees, ought to be ſet, rated, or levied, under any pretence, without conſent of the legiſlature.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. That the levying taxes by the poll is grievous and oppreſſive, and ought to be aboliſhed; that paupers ought not to be aſſeſſed for the ſupport of government, but every other perſon in the ſtate ought to contribute his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of public taxes for the ſupport of government, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his actual worth in real or perſonal property with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſtate; yet fines, duties, or taxes, may properly and juſtly be impoſed or laid with a political view for the good government and benefit of the community.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. That ſanguinary laws ought to be avoided, as far as is conſiſtent with the ſafety of the ſtate; and no law to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict cruel and unuſual pains and penalties ought to be made in any caſe, or at any time hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. That retroſpective laws, puniſhing facts committed before the exiſtence of ſuch laws, and by them only declared criminal, are oppreſſive, unjuſt, and incompatible with liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wherefore no <hi>ex poſt facto</hi> law ought to be made.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. That no law to attaint particular perſons of treaſon or felony ought to be made in any caſe, or any time here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. That every freeman, for any injury done him in his perſon or property, ought to have remedy by the courſe of the law of the land, and ought to have juſtice and right, freely without ſale, fully without any denial, and ſpeedily without delay, according to the law of the land.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. That the trial of facts where they ariſe, is one of the
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:017390_0119_0FA1113F87312408"/>
greateſt ſecurities of the lives, liberties, and eſtates of the people.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. That in all criminal proſecutions, every man hath a right to be informed of the accuſation againſt him, to have a copy of the indictment or charge in due time (if required) to prepare for his defence, to be allowed counſel, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted with the witneſſes againſt him, to have proceſs for his witneſſes, to examine the witneſſes for and againſt him on oath, and to a ſpeedy trial by an impartial jury, without whoſe unanimous conſent he ought not to be found guilty.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. That no man ought to be compelled to give evidence againſt himſelf in a common court of law, or in any other court, but in ſuch caſes as have been uſually practiſed in this ſtate, or may hereafter be directed by the legiſlature.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. That no freeman ought to be taken or impriſoned, or diſſeiſed of his freehold, liberties, or privileges, or outlawed, or exiled, or in any manner deſtroyed, or deprived of his life, liberty, or property, but by the judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. That exceſſive bail ought not to be required, nor exceſſive fines impoſed, nor cruel or unuſual puniſhments inflicted by the courts of law.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. That all warrants without oath or affirmation, to ſearch ſuſpected places, or to ſeize any perſon or property, are grievous and oppreſſive; and all general warrants to ſearch ſuſpected places, or to apprehend ſuſpected perſons, without naming or deſcribing the place, or the perſon in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, are illegal, and ought not to be granted.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. That there ought to be no forfeiture of any part of the eſtate of any perſon for any crime, except murder, or treaſon againſt the ſtate, and then only on conviction and attainder.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. That a well regulated militia is the proper and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral defence of a free government.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. That ſtanding armies are dangerous to liberty, and ought not to be raiſed or kept up without conſent of the legiſlature.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. That in all caſes and at all times the military ought
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:017390_0120_0FA11140461FA468"/>
to be under ſtrict ſubordination to, and controul of the civil power.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. That no ſoldier ought to be quartered in any houſe in time of peace, without the conſent of the owner; and in time of war, in ſuch manner only as the legiſlature ſhall direct.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. That no perſon, except regular ſoldiers, mariners, and marines in the ſervice of this ſtate, or militia when in actual ſervice, ought in any caſe to be ſubject to, or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by, martial law.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. That the independency and uprightneſs of judges are eſſential to the impartial adminiſtration of juſtice, and a great ſecurity to the rights and liberties of the people; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the chancellor and judges ought to hold commiſſions during good behaviour, and the ſaid chancellor and judges ſhall be removed for miſbehaviour, on conviction in a court of law, and may be removed by the governor upon the addreſs of the general aſſembly, provided that two thirds of all the members of each houſe concur in ſuch addreſs. That ſalaries liberal but not profuſe ought to be ſecured to the chancellor and the judges during the continuance of their commiſſions, in ſuch manner and at ſuch times as the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature ſhall hereafter direct, upon conſideration of the circumſtances of this ſtate: No chancellor or judge ought to hold any other office, civil or military, or receive fees or perquiſites of any kind.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. That a long continuance in the firſt executive depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of power or truſt is dangerous to liberty, a rotation therefore in thoſe departments is one of the beſt ſecurities of permanent freedom.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. That no perſon ought to hold at the ſame time more than one office of profit, nor ought any perſon in public truſt to receive any preſent from any foreign prince or ſtate, or from the united ſtates, or any of them, without the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of this ſtate.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. That as it is the duty of every man to worſhip God in ſuch manner as he thinks moſt acceptable to him, all perſons profeſſing the chriſtian religion are equally entitled to protection in their religious liberty; wherefore no perſon
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:017390_0121_0FA1114231454BE8"/>

And all acts of aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly lately paſſed for collecting monies for building or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing particular churches or chapels of eaſe, ſhall continue in force and be executed, unleſs the legiſlature ſhall by act ſupercede or repeal the ſame; but no county court ſhall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs any quantity of tobacco or ſum of money hereafter, on the application of any veſtry-men or church-wardens; and every incumbent of the church of England, who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in his pariſh, and performed his duty, ſhall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to receive the proviſion and ſupport eſtabliſhed by the act, entitled, "An act for the ſupport of the clergy of the church of England in this province," till the November court of this preſent year, to be held for the county in which his pariſh ſhall lie, or partly lie, or for ſuch time as he hath remained in his pariſh and performed his duty.</p>

                  <p n="35">35.

                  <p n="36">36.

And that the people called Quakers, thoſe called Dunkers, and thoſe called Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniſts, holding it unlawful to take an oath on any occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ought to be allowed to make their ſolemn affirmation in the manner that Quakers have been heretofore allowed to affirm, and to be of the ſame avail as an oath in all ſuch caſes, as the affirmation of Quakers hath been allowed and accepted within this ſtate, inſtead of an oath.

               <p>WE, the delegates and repreſentatives of the good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Virginia, do declare the future form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Virginia to be as followeth:</p>
               <p>The legiſlative, executive, and judiciary department, ſhall be ſeparate and diſtinct, ſo that neither exerciſe the powers properly belonging to the other; nor ſhall any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon exerciſe the powers of more than one of them at the ſame time, except that the juſtices of the county courts ſhall be eligible to either houſe of aſſembly.</p>
               <p>The legiſlative ſhall be formed of two diſtinct branches, who, together, ſhall be a complete legiſlature. They ſhall meet once, or oftener, every year, and ſhall be called, <hi>The General Aſſembly of Virginia.</hi> One of theſe ſhall be called, <hi>The Houſe of Delegates,</hi> and conſiſt of two repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives to be choſen for each county, and for the diſtrict of Weſt-Auguſta, annually, of ſuch men as actually reſide in and are freeholders of the ſame, or duly qualified ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to law, and alſo of one delegate or repreſentative to be choſen annually for the city of Williamſburgh, and one for the borough of Norfolk, and a repreſentative for
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:017390_0141_0FA11158B3329910"/>
each of ſuch other cities and buroughs as may hereafter be allowed particular repreſentation by the legiſlature; but when any city or burough ſhall ſo decreaſe, as that the number of perſons having right of ſuffrage therein, ſhall have been for the ſpace of ſeven years ſucceſſively, leſs than half the number of voters in ſome one county in Virginia, ſuch city or borough thenceforward ſhall ceaſe to ſend a delegate or repreſentative to the aſſembly.</p>
               <p>The other ſhall be called, <hi>The Senate,</hi> and conſiſt of twenty-four members, of whom thirteen ſhall conſtitute a houſe to proceed on buſineſs, for whoſe election the different counties ſhall be divided into twenty-four diſtricts, and each county of the reſpective diſtrict, at the time of the election of its delegates, ſhall vote for one ſenator, who is actually a reſident and freeholder within the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trict, or duly qualified according to law, and is upwards of twenty-five years of age; and the ſheriffs of each coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, within five days at fartheſt, after the laſt county elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the diſtrict, ſhall meet at ſome convenient place and from the poll ſo taken in their reſpective counties, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn as a ſenator the man who ſhall have the greateſt number of votes in the whole diſtrict. To keep up this aſſembly by rotation, the diſtricts ſhall be equally divided into four claſſes, and numbered by lot. At the end of one year after the general election, the ſix members elected by the firſt diviſion ſhall be diſplaced, and the vacancies thereby occaſioned ſupplied from ſuch claſs or diviſion. by new election in the manner aforeſaid. This rotation ſhall be applied to each diviſion according to its number, and continued in due order annually.</p>
               <p>The right of ſuffrage in the election of members for both houſes, ſhall remain as exerciſed at preſent, and each houſe ſhall chooſe its own ſpeaker, appoint its own offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, ſettle its own rules of proceeding, and direct writs of election for the ſupplying intermediate vacancies.</p>
               <p>All laws ſhall originate in the houſe of delegates, to be approved of or readied by the ſenate, or to be amended with conſent of the houſe of delegates; except money-bills,
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:017390_0142_0FA1115970E33688"/>
which in no inſtance ſhall be altered by the ſenate, but wholly approved or rejected.</p>
               <p>A governor, or chief magiſtrate ſhall be choſen annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, by joint ballot of both houſes, to be taken in each houſe reſpectively, depoſited in the conference room, the boxes examined jointly by a committee of each houſe, and the numbers ſeverally reported to them, that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments may be entered (which ſhall be the mode of tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the joint ballot of both houſes in all caſes) who ſhall not continue in that (office longer than three years ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively, nor be eligible until the expiration of four years after he ſhall have been out of that office. An adequate, but moderate ſalary ſhall be ſettled on him during his continuance in office; and he ſhall, with the advice of a council of ſtate, exerciſe the executive powers of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according to the laws of this commonwealth; and ſhall not, under any pretence, exerciſe any power or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative by virtue of any law, ſtatute, or cuſtom of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: But he ſhall, with the advice of the council of ſtate, have the power of granting reprieves or pardons, except where the proſecution ſhall have been carried on by the houſe of delegates, or the law ſhall otherwiſe particularly direct; in which caſes no reprieve or pardon ſhall be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but by reſolve of the houſe of delegates.</p>
               <p>Either houſe of the general aſſembly may adjourn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves reſpectively. The governor ſhall not prorogue or adjourn the aſſembly during their ſitting, nor diſſolve them at any time; but he ſhall, if neceſſary, either by advice of the council of ſtate, or on application of a majority of the houſe of delegates, call them before the time to which they ſhall ſtand prorogued or adjourned.</p>
               <p>A privy council, or council of ſtate, conſiſting of eight members ſhall be choſen by joint ballot of both houſes of aſſembly, either from their own members or the people at large, to aſſiſt in the adminiſtration of government. They ſhall annually chooſe, out of their own members, a preſident, who, in caſe of death, inability, or abſence of the governor from the government, ſhall act as lieutenant-governor. Four members ſhall be ſufficient to act, and
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:017390_0143_0FA1115B22863DD8"/>
their advice and proceedings ſhall be entered on record, and ſigned by the members preſent, (to any part whereof any member may enter his diſſent) to be laid before the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This council may appoint their own clerk, who ſhall have a ſalary ſettled by law, and take an oath of ſecrecy in ſuch matters as he ſhall be directed by the board to conceal. A ſum of money ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to that purpoſe, ſhall be divided annually among the members, in proportion to their attendance; and they ſhall be incapable, during their continuance in office, of ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in either houſe of aſſembly. Two members ſhall be removed by joint ballot of both houſes of aſſembly, at the end of every three years, and be ineligible for the three next years. Theſe vacancies, as well as thoſe occaſioned by death or incapacity, ſhall be ſupplied by new elections in the ſame manner.</p>
               <p>The delegates for Virginia to the continental congreſs ſhall be choſen annually, or ſuperſeded in the mean time by joint ballot of both houſes of aſſembly.</p>
               <p>The preſent militia officers ſhall be continued, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancies ſupplied by appointment of the governor, with the advice of the privy council, on recommendations from the reſpective county courts; but the governor and council ſhall have a power of ſuſpending any officer, and ordering a court martial on complaint of miſbehaviour or inability, or to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply vacancies of officers happening when in actual ſervice.</p>
               <p>The governor may embody the militia, with the advice of the privy council; and, when embodied, ſhall alone have the direction of the militia under the laws of the country.</p>
               <p>The two houſes of aſſembly ſhall, by joint ballot, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point judges of the ſupreme court of appeals, and general court, judges in chancery, judges of admiralty, ſecretary, and the attorney-general, to be commiſſioned by the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and continue in office during good behaviour. In caſe of death, incapacity, or reſignation, the governor, with the advice of the privy-council, ſhall appoint perſons to ſucceed in office, to be approved or diſplaced by both houſes. Theſe officers ſhall have fixed and adequate ſalaries, and, together

with all others holding lucrative offices, and all miniſters of the goſpel of every denomination, be incapable of being elected members of either houſe of aſſembly, or the privy-council.</p>
               <p>The governor, with the advice of the privy council, ſhall appoint juſtices of the peace for the counties; and in c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The preſent acting ſecretary in Virginia, and clerks of all the county courts, ſhall continue in office. In caſe of vacancies, either by death, incapacity, or reſignation, a ſecretary ſhall be appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as before directed, and the clerks by the reſpective courts. The preſent and future clerks ſhall hold their offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces during good behaviour, to be judged of and determined in the general court. The ſheriffs and coroners ſhall be nominated by the reſpective courts, approved by the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor with the advice of the privy-council, and commiſſioned by the governor. The juſtices ſhall appoint conſtables; and all fees of the aforeſaid officers be regulated by law.</p>
               <p>The governor, when he is out of office, and others of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending againſt the ſtate, either by mal-adminiſtration, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, or other means, by which the ſafety of the ſtate may be endangered, ſhall he impeachable by the houſe of delegates. Such impeachment to be proſecuted by the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney-general, or ſuch other perſon or perſons as the houſe may appoint, in the general court, according to the laws of the land. If found guilty, he or they ſhall be either for ever diſabled to hold any office under government, or be removed from ſuch office <hi>pro tempore,</hi> or ſubjected to ſuch pains or penalties as the law ſhall direct.</p>

               <head>GEORGIA. The <hi>CONSTITUTION</hi> of the State of <hi>Georgia,</hi> unanimouſly agreed to, in <hi>CONVENTION,</hi> the <hi>5</hi>th of Feb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruary, <hi>1777.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WHEREAS the conduct of the legiſlature of Great-Britain for many years paſt, has been ſo oppreſſive on the people of America, that of late years, they have plainly declared, and aſſerted a right to raiſe taxes upon the people of America, and to make laws to bind them in all caſes whatſoever, without their conſent; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct being repugnant to the common rights of mankind, hath obliged the Americans, as freemen to oppoſe ſuch oppreſſive meaſures, and to aſſert the rights and privileges they are intitled to, by the laws of nature and reaſon; and accordingly it hath been done by the general conſent of all the people of the ſtates of New-Hampſhire, Maſſachuſetts-Bay, Rhode-Iſland, Connecticut, New-York, New-Jerſey, Pennſylvania, the counties of Newcaſtle, Kent, and Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex on Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North-Carolina, South-Carolina, and Georgia, given by their repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives met together in general congreſs in the city of Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia.</p>
               <p>And whereas it hath been recommended by the ſaid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs on the fifteenth of May laſt, to the reſpective aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies and conventions of the united ſtates, where no go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, ſufficient to the exigencies of their affairs, hath been hitherto eſtabliſhed, to adopt ſuch government, as may, in the opinion of the repreſentatives of the people,
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:017390_0175_0FA1117C22F4B718"/>
beſt conduce to the happineſs and ſafety of their conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents in particular, and America in general.</p>
               <p>And whereas the independence of the united ſtates of America has been alſo declared, on the fourth day of July, one thouſand ſeven hundred and ſeventy-ſix, by the ſaid honourable congreſs, and all political connection between them and the crown of Great-Britain, is in conſequence thereof diſſolved.</p>
               <p>We, therefore, the repreſentatives of the people, from whom all power originates, and for whoſe benefit all go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is intended, by virtue of the power delegated to us, do ordain and declare, and it is hereby ordained and declared, that the following rules and regulations be adopted for the future government of this ſtate.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The legiſlative, executive, and judiciary departments ſhall be ſeparate and diſtinct, ſo that neither exerciſe the powers properly belonging to the other.</p>

               <p>On the firſt day of the meeting of the repreſentatives ſo choſen, they ſhall proceed to the choice of a governor, who ſhall be ſtiled, <hi>Honourable</hi>; and of an executive coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, by ballot out of their own body; <hi>viz.</hi> two from each county, except thoſe counties which are not yet entitled to ſend ten members. One of each county ſhall always attend where the governor reſides, by monthly rotation, unleſs the members of each county agree for a longer or ſhorter period; this is not intended to exclude either mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber attending: The remaining number of repreſentatives ſhall be called <hi>The Houſe of Aſſembly</hi>; and the majority of the members of the ſaid houſe ſhall have power to proceed on buſineſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It ſhall be an unalterable rule, that the houſe of
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:017390_0176_0FA1117C45A8B330"/>

               <hi>IN</hi> CONGRESS, <hi>JULY 4, 1776. A DECLARATION</hi> By the <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> of the <hi>UNITED STATES</hi> of <hi>AMERICA,</hi> in <hi>CONGRESS</hi> aſſembled.</head>
            <p>WHEN, in the courſe of human events, it becomes neceſſary for one people to diſſolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to aſſume among the powers of the earth, the ſeparate and equal ſtation to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them; a decent reſpect to the opinions of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind requires that they ſhould declare the cauſes which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel them to the ſeparation.</p>
            <p>We hold theſe truths to be ſelf evident; that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among theſe are life, liberty, and the purſuit of happineſs. That to ſecure theſe rights, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments are inſtituted among men, deriving their juſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers from the conſent of the governed; that whenever any form of government becomes deſtructive of theſe ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to aboliſh it, and to inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute new government, laying its foundation on ſuch princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and organizing its powers in ſuch form, as to them ſhall ſeem moſt likely to effect their ſafety and happineſs. Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, indeed, will dictate that governments long eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed ſhould not be changed for light and tranſient cauſes; and accordingly all experience hath ſhewn, that mankind
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:017390_0188_0FA1118A916E18E0"/>
are more diſpoſed to ſuffer, while evils are ſufferable, than to right themſelves by aboliſhing the forms to which they are accuſtomed. But when along train of abuſes and uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, purſuing invariably the ſame object, evinces a deſign to reduce them under abſolute deſpotiſm, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off ſuch government and to provide new guards for their future ſecurity. Such has been the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ſufferance of theſe colonies; and ſuch is now the neceſſity which conſtrains them to alter their former ſyſtems of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The hiſtory of the preſent king of Great-Britain is a hiſtory of repeated injuries and uſurpations, all having in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect object the eſtabliſhment of an abſolute tyranny over theſe ſtates. To prove this, let facts be ſubmitted to a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did world.</p>
            <p>He has refuſed his aſſent to laws, the moſt wholeſome and neceſſary for the public good.</p>
            <p>He has forbidden his governors to paſs laws of immediate and preſſing importance, unleſs ſuſpended in their operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on till his aſſent ſhould be obtained; and when ſo ſuſpended he has utterly neglected to attend to them.</p>
            <p>He has refuſed to paſs other laws for the accomodation of large diſtricts of people, unleſs thoſe people would relinquiſh the right of repreſentation in the legiſlature, a right ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to them, and formidable to tyrants only.</p>
            <p>He has called together legiſlative bodies at places unuſual, uncomfortable, and diſtant from the depoſitory of their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic records, for the ſole purpoſe of fatiguing them into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with his meaſures.</p>
            <p>He has diſſolved repreſentative houſes repeatedly, for oppoſing with manly firmneſs his invaſions on the rights of the people.</p>
            <p>He has refuſed, for a long time after ſuch diſſolutions, to cauſe others to be elected; whereby the legiſlative powers, incapable of annihilation, have returned to the people at large for their exerciſe; the ſtate remaining in the mean time expoſed to all the danger of invaſion from without, and convulſions within.</p>
            <p>He has endeavoured to prevent the population of theſe ſtates; for that purpoſe obſtructing the laws for naturalization of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners; refuſing to paſs others to encourage their migra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:017390_0189_0FA1118B49746130"/>
hither, and raiſing the conditions of new appropriati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of lands.</p>
            <p>He has obſtructed the adminiſtration of juſtice, by refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his aſſent to laws for eſtabliſhing judiciary powers.</p>
            <p>He has made judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their ſalaries.</p>
            <p>He has erected a multitude of new offices, and ſent hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſwarms of officers to harraſs our people, and eat out their ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>He has kept among us in times of peace, ſtanding armies, without the conſent of our legiſlatures.</p>
            <p>He has affected to render the military independent of and ſuperior to the civil power.</p>
            <p>He has combined with others to ſubject us to a juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on foreign to our conſtitution, and un-acknowledged by our laws; giving his aſſent to their acts of pretended legiſlation.</p>
            <p>For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:</p>
            <p>For protecting them, by a mock trial, from puniſhment for any murders which they ſhould commit on the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of theſe ſtates:</p>
            <p>For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world:</p>
            <p>For impoſing taxes on us without our conſent:</p>
            <p>For depriving us, in many caſes, of the benefits of trial by jury:</p>
            <p>For tranſporting us beyond ſeas to be tried for pretended offences:</p>
            <p>For aboliſhing the free ſyſtem of Engliſh laws in a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring province, eſtabliſhing therein an arbitrary govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and enlarging its boundaries, ſo as to render it at once an example and fit inſtrument for introducing the ſame ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute rule into theſe colonies:</p>
            <p>For taking away our charters, aboliſhing our moſt valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able laws, and altering fundamentally the forms of our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments:</p>
            <p>For ſuſpending our own legiſlatures, and declaring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves inveſted with power to legiſlate for us in all caſes whatſoever.</p>
            <p>He has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of his protection, and waging war againſt us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="190" facs="unknown:017390_0190_0FA1118C13702E58"/>He has plundered our ſeas, ravaged our coaſts, burnt our towns, and deſtroyed the lives of our people.</p>
            <p>He is, at this time, tranſporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to compleat the works of death, deſolation and tyranny, already begun with circumſtances of cruelty and perfidy, ſcarcely paralleled in the moſt barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation.</p>
            <p>He has conſtrained our fellow citizens, taken captive on the high ſeas, to bear arms againſt their country, to become the executioners of their friends and brethren, or to fall them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by their hands.</p>
            <p>He has excited domeſtic inſurrections amongſt us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the mercileſs indian ſavages, whoſe known rule of warfare is an undiſtinguiſhed deſtruction of all ages, ſexes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>
            <p>In every ſtage of theſe oppreſſions we have petitioned for redreſs in the moſt humble terms: our repeated petitions have been anſwered only by repeated injury. A prince, whoſe character is thus marked by every act which may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.</p>
            <p>Nor have we been wanting in attention to our Britiſh brethren. We have warned them from time to time of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts made by their legiſlature to extend an unwarrantable juriſdiction over us. We hare reminded them of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of our emigration and ſettlement here. We have appealed to their native juſtice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them, by the ties of our common kindred, to diſavow theſe uſurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correſpondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of juſtice and of conſanguinity. We muſt, therefore, acquieſce in the neceſſity, which denounces our ſeparation, and hold them, as we hold the reſt of mankind, enemies in war, in peace friends.</p>
            <p>We, therefore, the Repreſentatives of the United States of America, in General Congreſs aſſembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name and by the authority of the good people of theſe colonies, ſolemnly publiſh and decl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e,
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:017390_0191_0FA1118DD7372938"/>
That theſe United Colonies are, and of right ought to be FREE <hi>and</hi> INDEPENDENT STATES; That they are abſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from all allegiance to the Britiſh crown, and that all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical connection between them and the ſtate of Great Britain is and ought to be totally diſſolved; and that as Free and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent States, they have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, eſtabliſh commerce, and to do all other acts and things which independent ſtates may of right do. And for the ſupport of this declaration, with a firm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance on the protection of divine providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our ſacred honour.</p>

                  <p>The reſpective plenipotentiaries impowered to concert the clauſes and conditions proper to fulfil the ſaid intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, have, after the moſt mature deliberation, concluded and determined on the following articles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Article</hi> 1. IF war ſhould break out between France and Great-Britain, during the continuance of the preſent war between the united ſtates and England, his majeſty and the ſaid united ſtates ſhall make it a common cauſe, and aid each other mutually with their good offices, their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and their forces, according to the exigence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctures, as becomes good and faithful allies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="224" facs="unknown:017390_0224_0FA11111F2CC49A8"/>
                     <hi>Art.</hi> 2. The eſſential and direct end of the preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive alliance is, to maintain effectually the liberty, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty, and independence abſolute and unlimited, of the ſaid united ſtates, as well in matters of government as of commerce.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Art.</hi> 3. The two contracting parties ſhall, each on its own part, and in the manner it may judge moſt proper, make all the efforts in it's power againſt their common enemy, in order to attain the end propoſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Art.</hi> 4. The contracting parties agree, that in caſe either of them ſhould form any particular enterprize in which the concurrence of the other may be deſired, the party whoſe concurrence is deſired, ſhall readily and with good faith join to act in concert for that purpoſe, as far as circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and its own particular ſituation will permit, and in that caſe, they ſhall regulate by a particular conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the quantity and kind of ſuccour to be furniſhed, and the time and manner of its being brought into action, as well as the advantages which are to be its compenſation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Art.</hi> 5. If the united ſtates ſhould think fit to attempt the reduction of the Britiſh power, remaining in the northern parts of America, or the iſlands of Bermudas, thoſe countries or iſlands, in caſe of ſucceſs, ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſederated with, or dependent upon the ſaid united ſtates.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Art.</hi> 6.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Art.</hi> 7. If his moſt chriſtian majeſty ſhall think proper to attack any of the iſlands ſituated in the Gulph of Mex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ico, or near that gulph, which are at preſent under the power of Great Britain, all the ſaid iſles, in caſe of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, ſhall appertain to the crown of France.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Art.</hi> 8. Neither of the two parties ſhall conclude either truce or peace with Great-Britain, without the formal
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:017390_0225_0FA111128E2B6160"/>
conſent of the other firſt obtained; and they mutually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage not to lay down their arms, until the independence of the united ſtates ſhall have been formally or tacitly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, by the treaty or treaties that ſhall terminate the war.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Art.</hi> 9. The contracting parties declare, that being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to fulfil each on it's own part, the clauſes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the preſent treaty of alliance, according to its own power and circumſtances, there ſhall be no after-claim of compenſation, on one ſide or the other, whatever may be the event of the war.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Art.</hi> 10. The moſt chriſtian king and the united ſtates agree, to invite or admit other powers, who may have received injuries from England, to make common cauſe with them, and to accede to the preſent alliance, under ſuch conditions as ſhall be freely agreed to, and ſettled between all the parties.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Art.</hi> 11. The two parties guarantee mutually from the preſent time and forever, againſt all other powers, <hi>to wit.</hi> The united ſtates to his moſt chriſtian majeſty, the preſent poſſeſſions of the crown of France in America, as well as thoſe which it may acquire by the future treaty of peace; and his moſt chriſtian majeſty guarantees on his part to the united ſtates, their liberty, ſovereignty, and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, abſolute and unlimited, as well in matters of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as commerce, and alſo their poſſeſſions, and the additions or conqueſts, that their confederation may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain during the war, from any of the dominions now, or heretofore poſſeſſed by Great-Britain in North-America; conformable to the fifth and ſixth articles above written, the whole as their poſſeſſion ſhall be fixed and aſſured to the ſaid ſtates, at the moment of the ceſſation of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent war with England.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Art.</hi> 12. In order to fix more preciſely the ſenſe and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the preceding article, the contracting parties declare, that in caſe of a rupture between France and England, the reciprocal guarantee declared in the ſaid ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, ſhall have its full force and effect, the moment ſuch war ſhall break out; and if ſuch rupture ſhall not take
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:017390_0226_0FA111134624DC58"/>
place, the mutual obligations of the ſaid guarantee ſhall not commence until the moment of the ceſſation of the preſent war, between the united ſtates and England, ſhall have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained their poſſeſſions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Art.</hi> 13. The preſent treaty ſhall be ratified on both ſides, and the ratifications ſhall be exchanged in the ſpace of ſix months, or ſooner, if poſſible.</p>
