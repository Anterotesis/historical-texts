            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THOUGH the Pamphlet, to which the following <hi>LETTER</hi> is an <hi>ANSWER,</hi> is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have been originally deſigned only for the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> uncommon Pains have been taken to ſpread it through this Kingdom<note n="*" place="bottom">Ireland.</note>, and eſpecially in the Northern Parts of it, among the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> there. The whole of it is written with ſo virulent a Spirit, and with ſo little regard to truth and candor, that it is hard to believe, what is confidently reported, that it has received great countenance from perſons of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed eminence and authority, in the Church. But whether this be ſo or not, it continues to be induſtriouſly propagated, and great uſe has been, and ſtill is made of it, for expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> and their worſhip. It is not therefore to be wondered at, if, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having long borne theſe inſults with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, <hi>One of that Denomination</hi> thinks himſelf obliged to take ſome notice of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, which, becauſe it has hitherto been neglected, is pretended to be <hi>unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi> If any thing is ſaid in a way of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary

defence, which may be diſagreeable to ſome perſons, it muſt be laid to their charge, who, unprovoked, have endeavored to inſult and expoſe thoſe, who were willing to be at peace with them.<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <p>THE editor of this <hi>American</hi> impreſſion preſumes that the above apology for troubling the public with an anſwer to the Blackſmith, will now apply to this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with as much propriety, as the author believed it would to Ireland when it was firſt publiſhed.</p>
                  <p>PRESBYTERIANS have generally lived with Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palians here in peace and good humour. A full equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of liberty with themſelves they heartily wiſhed theſe their brethren to enjoy, unmoleſted; and could not but hope for the ſame candid diſpoſition from them. It is with pain they receive the conviction of their diſappointment, from the extraordinary zeal with which the diſciples of that communion have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bored to publiſh and to circulate the falſe and ſcurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous libel here noticed.</p>
                  <p>THE modeſty and good ſenſe of this writer could not deſcend to bedaub his antagoniſt or his party with colours correſpondent to the dirt thrown by his pen.</p>
                  <p>SO far, however, as reaſon and truth can have any weight with the blackſmith and his friends, it is not doubted they will find a ſufficient anſwer in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing pages.</p>
                  <p>IF, indeed, they are pleaſed to plume themſelves on their author's ſuperiority in ribaldry and abuſe; that is an honor of which we envy them not the unrivalled poſſeſſion.—But if they ſhould appear to judge that this is the beſt time, for expoſing to public ridicule the ſuppoſed defects in their neighbouring churches— M. Twogood and De Launc are not the only writers now ready to anſwer a fool according to his folly.</p>

            <p>THE whole of your charge againſt the church of <hi>Scotland</hi> and its adherents, may be ſummed up in four particulars.</p>
            <p>THE firſt, relates to the public reading of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>THE ſecond, to pſalmody.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:021967_0005_0FB6596525C163D8"/>THE third, to the indecencies that attend the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Lord's Supper.</p>
            <p>AND the fourth, to extemporary prayer.</p>
            <p>UPON each of theſe heads, you have collected what you think exceptionable, inconvenient, and defective; and I hope with impartiality to follow you in your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, and to obviate your charge.</p>
            <p>You firſt<note n="*" place="bottom">Blackſmith's Letter, pages 7th and 8th, Newbury-port Edition.</note> ſubmit it to the ſerious conſideration of the gentlemen of the church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> "whether a larger portion of the ſcriptures ſhould not be read, every Lord's day, in their public aſſemblies," and you are, or pretend to be, "at a loſs whether to aſcribe the negligence of this eſſential part of their ſervice to the pride of the clergy, or the perverſeneſs of the people," &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I ANSWER, that according to the conſtitution of that church, it is provided, that the <hi>canonical</hi> books of the ſcriptures ſhould be read over in order; but ſuch as miniſter in holy things, are not tied down to a certain portion of them, in excluſion to the reſt, nor are they obliged to ſubſtitute <hi>apocryphal,</hi> inſtead of <hi>canonical</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, in their public ſervice; but it is left to their pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and free arbitration what, and how much, of the inſpired books ſhall be read. Upon this account the cuſtom varies in almoſt every church; ſome read whole <hi>chapters</hi> without any comment; others make a few per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent remarks, according as paſſages are more or leſs difficult; others who are at more pains, proceed in a regular courſe of explaining a certain number of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, 'till in this manner they go through all the ſacred writings. I am inclinable to pay this compliment, Sir, to your knowledge of antiquity, as to believe you are not ignorant, that this method of inſtruction took its riſe very early in the <hi>chriſtian</hi> church;<note n="§" place="bottom">We have reaſon to believe our Lord himſelf uſed it, as is pretty plain from (Luke <hi>iv. 1</hi>ſ.) And in his diſcourſe with the two Diſciples going to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> Luke <hi>xxiv. 27.</hi> And if we may judge of the manner of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſed by ſome of the Fathers, (See the works of <hi>Origen, Baſil,</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi>) by thoſe diſcourſes that remain, it was chiefly expounding the Scriptures.</note> and where it

hath been obſerved ſince the <hi>reformation,</hi> as pretty ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally it is among that people, and their adherents, who are cenſured ſo ſeverely by you, it muſt be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that it hath tended exceedingly to the uſe of edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and it is quite natural that it ſhould have this effect, as it gives the audience a very clear view of what is read to them, and impreſſeth ſacred truths more deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the mind.</p>
            <p>AND to the honor of the laity of the church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> I ſhall mention it, as <hi>Paul</hi> commended the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans;</hi> they are more univerſally acquainted with the ſcriptures, than the laity of any other church whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. If, therefore, from the methods uſed among them, the happieſt conſequences have been and are produced; and if they are countenanced likewiſe by the beſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, what avails your ridicule on the pride of the clergy and Perverſeneſs of the people?</p>
            <p>AS to your manner of reaſoning, Sir, againſt pulpit expoſitions, that by them "the underſtandings of the laity are put too much in the power of the clergy, and the ſimple and ignorant are expoſed to be ſeduced by the party principles and whimſical opinions of the preacher," &amp;c. I ſhall only obſerve that it holds equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good againſt ſermonizing of every kind, and all comments upon the ſcriptures whatſoever.</p>
            <p>YOUR next charge againſt the church of <hi>Scotland</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects its pſalmody<note n="*" place="bottom">Blackſmith's Letter, page <hi>11,</hi> &amp;c.</note>. "As to praiſe, you ſay, they ſeem to ſtudy to give this part of their worſhip as much the air of ruſticity and contempt of God as poſſible—No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to engage or elevate the heart—the words obſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lete and low—the verſification mean and barbarous— the muſic harſh and ill performed—and the poſture moſt indecent."</p>
            <p>AS to the firſt part of this ſevere accuſation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you aſſume what belongs only to the Searcher of hearts, and characterize this ſolemn ſervice as a direct

I hope you will be brought to think more ſeriouſly and juſtly of this important matter, and to acknowledge that where there is not a word uttered, or a ſound heard, there yet may be me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody harmonious and acceptable.</p>

Without the leaſt cenſure, others may be, and by ſome are ſubſtituted in the room of them; and if we may judge of the elevation of the heart, from the united voices of the performers, the church of <hi>Scotland</hi> and its adherents muſt ſecure our charitable approbation. As pſalmody makes up a very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable part of the chriſtians' devotions, there are very few, of that denomination, who think it <hi>beneath them to ſing the praiſes of the</hi> Almighty; and, excepting in ſome remote country congregations, the muſic is far from being ill performed.</p>
            <p>AS to the poſture; where ſuch a number join in ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it would perhaps tend more to diſcord than to harmony, if they ſhould all perform ſtanding. When the poſture is therefore of no importance, what adds to the harmony muſt be principally attended to. But if any of the <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> communion in <hi>Scotland,</hi> or any <hi>proteſtant</hi> diſſenter in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> or wherever this perſuaſion is embraced, chooſe ſtanding, or even kneeling in this ſervice, he is at his liberty, and may, unreproved, uſe the manner moſt agreeable to himſelf.

               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:021967_0009_0FB6597779F3FBB8"/>FOR the benefit of thoſe who are in a great meaſure ſtrangers to the uſages of this church, reſpecting the ſacrament of the Lord's ſupper, it is neceſſary to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that, ever ſince the <hi>reformation,</hi> communicants in it have been very numerous: this, which is neither a fault nor an indecency, neceſſarily occaſions a labour extraordinary, to which no one man's abilities can be ſuppoſed equal. The neighbouring miniſters, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whoſe aſſiſtance is required, ſometimes draw after them a number from their reſpective churches, who may chooſe to put themſelves to a little trouble, rather than to enjoy at home a ſilent ſabbath, or perhaps be obliged to attend miniſtrations from which they could not expect ſuch profit. But it is worthy of our notice, that if any of the ſober part from the neighbouring pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes attend, with a deſign to join in the participation of the memorials of our Saviour's Paſſion, they cannot be admitted, unleſs properly atteſted from the miniſters or officers of the churches to which they belong. This is not indecent, but deſireably regular: if they are ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators only, and do not communicate, this can be no detriment, but an incitement rather, to the devotion of thoſe who are more ſolemnly engaged.</p>
            <p>AND it may be juſtly ſaid, that the whole work, as far as it regards the regular members, is conducted with as much decency and as little ſhare of confuſion, as could well be expected, where ſuch numbers have a right to be admitted, and cannot, merely to avoid a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle inconveniency, be excluded.</p>
            <p>BUT it muſt be allowed, that while ſome, from the beſt and pureſt motives, are led to ſuch ordinances, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the meaner claſs, and who ſeldom act from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worthy principle, aſſemble with them likewiſe; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe are hardened wretches, who inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affected with the ſolemn gravity around them, ſeem to rejoice in ſuch opportunities of ſhewing themſelves <hi>ten times more</hi> the ſervants of the Devil.</p>
            <p>IF then, Sir, there have been indecencies obſerveable in any particular churches, among thoſe you would
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:021967_0010_0FB6597B385DDEE0"/>
cenſure, they were, without doubt, principally occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by the indiſcretions of unworthy ſpectators, who croud to ſuch ſolemnities, and who cannot be reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from doing ſo, unleſs, Mr. <hi>Blackſmith,</hi> you who ſeem to have the good of that church <hi>greatly</hi> at heart, would pleaſe to ſolicit for letters patent to make bolts and fetters to bind at home the irregular rabble. But while a mixed multitude is permitted, where many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene of various denominations, who neither fear God, nor honor the legiſlative power, it is not to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but that there ſhould be inſtances of folly and impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety to caſt a melancholy ſhade over ſuch ſolemnities.</p>
            <p>THIS, however, I dare affirm, that of all the reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed churches, there are none more careful, with reſpect to their regular members, than that which your ſatire would bring a reproach on. No perſons can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to its privileges, without giving ſufficient evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence both of their knowledge as to the principles of <hi>chriſtianity,</hi> and of their moral character: if the leaſt ſtain hath invaded this latter, they are obliged to give the fellow members of their community full ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, either of their innocence or of their repentance, before they are permitted to receive the ſacrament of the Lord's ſupper. And in truth, ſuch care is taken to preſerve a pure church, by continual inſpection and enquiry, as deſerves the applauſe and imitation of all who lay claim to the character of <hi>reformed</hi>

            <p>BUT, Mr. <hi>Blackſmith,</hi> if all the wicked of the earth ſhould join together, and be aided with all that your vilifying genius could ſuggeſt, to render a ſacred ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ridiculous, this muſt not, and with the ſolid rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners and juſt thinkers among our readers, will not, bring any reproach upon the ſober and ſerious part, who form the body, as in truth they are by far the majority, of <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> or Proteſtant <hi>Diſſenters.</hi> Thoſe who have in the leaſt incurred your cenſure, will, I hope, be taught by you, (for we may take a hint even from an enemy) for the future to enter into ſuch prudential ſchemes as may ſecure them from every thing indecent or irregular.

<pb n="15" facs="unknown:021967_0014_0FB6598268267528"/>
univerſal conſent and opinion of mankind is a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive argument, when applied to the firſt and greateſt article of religion, the exiſtence of God, it muſt be ſo too with reſpect to the beſt and fitteſt way of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping him."</p>
            <p>BEFORE I enter into the merits of this argument, I muſt beg to be heard a little, as to my own private opinion of prayer, and its requiſites. If we underſtand the nature of prayer, diſputes about the manner of offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up our addreſſes, will be the more eaſily adjuſted.</p>
            <p>THE nature of this ſolemn duty, I apprehend, may be expreſſed in few words. It is a lifting up of the mind towards God, the Fountain of all good, with humble requeſts for ſuch things as we want or ſtand in need of, and are agreeable to the will of God; who, by all that profeſs themſelves <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed in the name of the Lord Jeſus, with a general or particular confeſſion of ſins, and thankful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments for the continual and merciful ſupplies of his providence and grace; ſhewing the ſenſe of our minds either in the language of the heart, or in the expreſſion of this language by proper words.</p>
            <p>THIS, I think, is a juſt deſcription of prayer; and if we apply the debates about the manner of worſhip to any part of it, I think they muſt appear very frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. Who dare ſay, that ſtated forms, are ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and eſſentially neceſſary to the due performance of this duty, as that without them there can be no acceptance? And on the other hand, would it be leſs preſumption, to exclude from the favorable regards of the Deity, all ſtated forms of devotion? Upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count we ſhould be very cautious of condemning thoſe of either party, who differ from us in this matter;
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:021967_0015_0FB659886F782150"/>
for it muſt be granted, that though we may diſagree in the manner of offering up our addreſſes, yet the ſpirit of devotion may not be wanting in which ever way we chooſe.</p>
            <p>THE experiences of many valuable and ſincere <hi>Chriſtians</hi> on both ſides of the queſtion, prove the truth of this; while they evidently ſhew the raſhneſs and folly of the blind cenſurer. What are forms or modes of worſhip, when compared with the graces of faith, love, humility, ſincerity, contrition, reſignation, and thoſe holy deſires, and devout affections, which are the life and ſoul of prayer? As for thoſe, therefore, who join with you, Mr. <hi>Blackſmith,</hi> in ſpeaking diſreſpectfully of the manner uſed by the church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and it's adherents, calling it cant, jargon, blaſphemous effuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Preſbyterian inſpiration,</hi> and the like, let all who would deſire to act as <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> pity and pray for you; but let them beware of imitating a rudeneſs, ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with all the rules of religion and charity, as well as good manners.</p>
            <p>I SHALL now enter upon this diſagreeable argument, but it ſhall be in the ſpirit of meekneſs, and ſo as not, deſignedly, to give offence to any, who in their worſhip, make uſe of precompoſed forms; and as what I write is intended to be of general ſervice to all who can think or judge of this ſubject, my remarks ſhall be brief, and plain as poſſible.</p>
            <p>YOUR firſt argument, as already laid down, is taken from the univerſal conſent and practice of mankind, which, as you alledge, "If it be fitly applied to the proof of the firſt and greateſt article of religion, the exiſtence of God, muſt be equally con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

in the darkneſs of the night, and till the dawning of the morning, out of a precompoſed liturgy, would be an affront to common ſenſe. And thus we ſee from the earlieſt hiſtory of God's church, how groundleſs that aſſertion is, "That the preſent <hi>extempore</hi> way of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip uſed by <hi>Preſbyters</hi> and others, is contrary to the practice and opinion of all mankind, in all ages<note n="*" place="bottom">Blackſmith's <hi>Letter, p.</hi> 22.</note>;" and how little, Sir, we are to depend upon your can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and ingenuity, who can aſſert ſuch things.</p>
            <p>IF we continue our enquiries, and conſider the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and practices of <hi>Melchizedec, Job, Moſes, Joſhua, David, Daniel,</hi> and of all who, in fervent prayer, have ſtood before God, we ſhall find them preſerving the ſame method of addreſs, pouring forth their hearts in free prayer, ſuch as the ſpirit of God, and their various circumſtances dictated. We do not find <hi>Joſhua,</hi> for example, making uſe of the words of <hi>Moſes,</hi> though their ſituation was in many reſpects parallel; and tho' we might reaſonably expect, that this great follower of ſo great a Maſter, if it had been moſt agreeable to the divine will, would have done ſo. Nor do we find <hi>David</hi> fettered by any form in his devotions; nor <hi>Daniel</hi> and the prophets confined to the devotional ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> is often repreſented to us as a powerful inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor for the people of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and one particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is mentioned, wherein his hands were ſtretched forth in earneſt prayer, upheld by <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur,</hi> through a bloody day, <hi>'till the going down of the ſun.</hi> We have likewiſe the prophet <hi>Elijah,</hi> ſpeedily deciding the controverſy between him and the prieſts of <hi>Baal,</hi> by <hi>extempore</hi> prayer. We have him reſtoring the widow's ſon of <hi>Zarephath</hi> to life in the ſame manner. A like inſtance is recorded of <hi>Eliſha</hi> his eminent ſucceſſor.</p>
            <p>WE have the moſt noble and generous interpoſition of <hi>David</hi> for his people, when the deſtroying angel was making ſuch alarming and dreadful devaſtations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:021967_0019_0FB65993567E02C8"/>WE have the record of <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> ſucceſs againſt the formidable <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> invaſion, by the ſame means; and of his deliverance from a private affliction, when he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the Lord, and he had this comfortable and ſpeedy anſwer, <hi>I have heard thy prayer, I have ſeen thy tears, behold I will hear thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE have an inſtance no leſs ſtriking in <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> who <hi>humbled himſelf greatly</hi> in his affliction, <hi>and the Lord was entreated of him.</hi> The ſame may be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of <hi>Jonah</hi> and the Mariners, they neither had nor uſed a form; which, in that Prophet's particular ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, would be abſurd to think of.</p>
            <p>AFTER the eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Temple</hi> worſhip, it cannot be ſaid, any more than of the period preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that free prayer was reſtrained: We have many inſtances to the contrary; and the very prayer of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> at the dedication of it, throws ſo much light upon this argument, that it is worthy of our ſtricteſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. Such a variety of caſes are put, wherein it is proper for men to offer up their free and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſcribed addreſſes, that all, who duly conſider it, muſt be ſatisfied in this matter. <hi>If any man,</hi> ſays he, <hi>treſpaſs againſt his neighbour, then hear thou in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and do, and judge thy ſervants, condemning the wicked to bring his way upon his head, and juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the righteous,</hi> to <hi>give him according to his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. When thy people Iſrael be ſmitten down before the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and confeſs thy name and pray—then hear thou in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and forgive the ſin of thy people Iſrael.—When Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is ſhut up, and there is no rain, if they pray towards this place,—then hear thou in Heaven, and forgive the ſin of thy ſervants.—If there be in the land famine; if there be peſtilence, blaſting, mildew, locuſt; or if there be caterpillar; if their enemy beſiege them in the land of their cities; whatſoever plague, whatſoever ſickneſs there be; what prayer and ſupplication ſoever be made by any man, or by all thy people Iſrael, which ſhall know every man the plague of his own heart, and ſpread forth his

hands towards this houſe; then hear thou in Heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whoſe heart thou knoweſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How generous and unlimited is this ſolemn dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! Not precluding any from the public ſervices of the <hi>Temple,</hi> who know the plague of their own hearts, or who ſpread forth their hands thither. Many do we find making uſe of this privilege, and reaping the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of it. The <hi>Temple</hi> was, in truth, what our Saviour calls it, <hi>an Houſe of Prayer,</hi> as well as a place of Sacrifice; and whatever other oblations were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, theſe were always accompanied, either with the private addreſſes to God of the party offering, or of the Prieſts for them, as their particular circumſtances required.</p>
            <p>THIS, Sir, is the hiſtory of prayer from the accounts we have of it in the <hi>Old Teſtament;</hi> what more authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic records of early time you may have diſcovered, I cannot tell. Some ſuch, it is to be ſuppoſed, you muſt have diſcovered, to bear you out in that aſſertion, "that the preſent extemporary way of worſhip, is contrary to the practice and opinion of all Mankind, in all ages, and of all religions." But whatever your reaſons are for maintaining this ſtrange propoſition, I will venture to affirm that they are not ſcriptural. Neither are they countenanced by profane writers of the beſt repute.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> hath witneſſed already to this truth: and can it be thought, that this part of ſcripture, which is ſo very minute in obſerving the ſmalleſt matters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the <hi>tabernacle,</hi> and every fringe, or plate in the prieſt's veſtments, would have omitted the form of words to be uſed in the daily ſervice, if ſuch had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed?

If you ſay the manner only; where have you learned this? For I do not find in my <hi>teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> the leaſt hint to countenance ſuch an imagination. That our Saviour frequently took the opportunity of ſuch aſſemblies, ſharply to reprove the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,</hi> for their inventions and impoſitions in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip

of God; and likewiſe to inſtruct them in the true and ſpiritual meaning of the law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> the ſenſe of which, by their corrupt gloſſes, they had dreadfully perverted, is readily granted. But can any heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that he meant to ſanctify what he ſo ſharply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves; or to eſtabliſh a form of worſhip that was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the point of expiring? His own practice teacheth us the contrary of this; the ſea-ſide, mountains, and deſart places, night, as well as day, were witneſſes to the decency, ſpirituality and fervor of his devotions; and by this we are inſtructed, that, in every place, he who worſhipeth God <hi>in ſpirit and in truth, ſhall be accepted of him, for the Father ſeeketh ſuch to worſhip him.</hi> It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt unneceſſary to prove it, the thing is ſo very plain, that, now, under the purity of that religion which our bleſſed Saviour hath eſtabliſhed, all outward ceremonies, modes and circumſtances of worſhip are commanded to give place to the ſanctity of the heart, and the inward devotion of ſpirit. That <hi>the time is now come, when nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at Jeruſalem,</hi> nor at this, or the other mount, with faces towards the <hi>temple, but in every place, the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of the Father, are to worſhip him,</hi> not turning over leaves, but <hi>lifting up holy hands, without wrath or doubting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>DID the humble <hi>publican,</hi> though in the <hi>temple,</hi> read his prayers? Or where had the proud <hi>phariſee</hi> his vaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing form?</p>
            <p>BESIDES, Sir, ſince you have ſo ingeniouſly uſed our Saviour's attendance on Synagogue-Worſhip, as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for adopting their manner, why not their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alſo? Or will you pretend to ſay that our Saviour, in his attendance upon the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> ſervice, paid more defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the form than to the matter? I am perſuaded, Sir, that though it be the natural conſequence of your reaſoning, you did not mean to involve yourſelf in this ſhocking <hi>dilemma.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN ſupport of what you recommend, you further af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that our Saviour ſanctified forms of prayer by his practice: "for in his agony in the garden, he roſe up,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:021967_0024_0FB659A7E0EA6C10"/>
awakened and rebuked the diſciples, returned to the ſame place, and repeated the ſame form of words three times over."</p>
            <p>IF the <hi>evangeliſts</hi> had ſaid that our Saviour exactly repeated the ſame expreſſions three times over, nothing could be concluded from thence for ſtated invariable forms of prayer in public worſhip. Our Lord's cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances were then of a peculiar nature, and the petitions he offered, turned upon one point: and he who would argue, that we ought always to repeat the ſame words in prayer, becauſe <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in theſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar circumſtances did ſo, would ſhew himſelf a piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reaſoner; but the truth is, the fact itſelf is miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, and the evangeliſts themſelves witneſs againſt you.</p>
            <p>THE words of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> are theſe, [ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> xvi. 36, <hi>&amp;c.] Then cometh Jeſus with them, unto a place called Gethſemane, and ſaith unto the diſciples, ſit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.—And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, ſaying, O my Father, if it be poſſible, let this cup paſs from me, nevertheleſs, not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi>

            <p>THIS, Sir, is what you are pleaſed to call the form, and to aſſert that our Saviour repeated it three times over; but in the <hi>evangeliſt's</hi> account there is a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able variation in our Lord's ſecond prayer. For he tells us, that after modeſtly chiding his diſciples, and at the ſame time apologizing for their weakneſs, <hi>he went away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the ſecond time, and prayed, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup may not paſs from me except I drink it, thy will be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN the account of the evangeliſt St. <hi>Mark,</hi>
               <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Mark</hi> xiv. 36.</note> there is ſtill a greater variation.<note n="(b)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> xxii. 44.</note> And St. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, that <hi>being in agony, he prayed more earneſtly;</hi> which we may juſtly ſuppoſe the evangeliſt relates of his third prayer, for he ſays that after returning to, and exhorting his diſciples, <hi>while he yet ſpake,</hi> a multitude, and <hi>Judas</hi> with them, came to apprehend him.<note n="*" place="bottom">But perhaps becauſe it is ſaid, in St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Mark</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our tranſlation, that <hi>he prayed ſaying the ſame words.</hi> (Matt. <hi>xxvi. 44.</hi> Mark <hi>xiv. 39.</hi>) the meaning muſt be, that he uſed preciſely the ſame Expreſſions. A man of learning, as you, Mr. <hi>Blackſmith,</hi> take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you to be, ought to know, however, that the paſſage in the original, in both Evangeliſts, runs thus, <hi>TON AUTON LOGON EIPOON, LOGOS</hi> is not expreſſed in the plural number, and therefore is improperly rendered <hi>Words,</hi> as it might have been, if <hi>REMATA</hi> had been made uſe of. It is well known that <hi>LOGOS</hi> admits of various Significations, and is variouſly rendered by our Tranſlators. In <hi>Luke xx. 3.</hi> they tranſlate it <hi>Thing.</hi> In <hi>Acts viii. 21.</hi> as alſo <hi>Acts xv. 6</hi> and <hi>Acts xix. 28.</hi> it is tranſlated <hi>Matter.</hi> In <hi>Romans ix. 28.</hi> it is rendered <hi>Work.</hi> And in <hi>Act x. 29.</hi> it is rendered <hi>Intent,</hi> and might be rendered <hi>Purpoſe.</hi> That paſſage, therefore, in St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Mark,</hi> might have been properly rendered, <hi>ſpeaking the ſame Thing</hi> or <hi>Matter.</hi> Or if the original had it that he ſpake the ſame <hi>REMATA,</hi> though this alſo is uſed to ſignify Things as well as Words, it muſt neceſſarily be underſtood thus, that he ſpake words to the ſame Purpoſe; except we make the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict themſelves; ſince, as hath been already ſhewed, the Words, as recorded by them, are not preciſely the ſame Expreſſions, though to the ſame Senſe.</note>

               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:021967_0025_0FB659A9A1E87350"/>THIS then, Sir, makes nothing in your favor: And all that can be gathered from it is, that our Saviour being under a particular preſſure, from the full proſpect of his approaching ſufferings, returned thrice to the ſame ſubject—not barely <hi>ſaying the ſame words</hi>—but as his mind dwelt upon this matter, ſo his devotion ran upon it, and his words were to one effect.</p>
            <p>IF, however, we conſider, the ſeaſon of the night, the admonition of our Lord to his Diſciples to <hi>watch and pray,</hi> or his own example—we muſt conclude, from this paſſage, that free prayer is not without the ſtrongeſt arguments to enforce it.</p>
            <p>AS another recommendation of ſtated forms, you aſſert that our Saviour "Before he expired on the croſs, offered up his devotions in the words of the twenty-ſecond <hi>Pſalm.</hi>"</p>
            <p>I ANSWER, that, therefore, any man in imitation of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> example, may freely chooſe out and apply to his own caſe, or the caſe of others, ſuch ſcriptural expreſſions as ſhall be moſt ſuitable to them. For our Lord, upon this mournful occaſion, does not make uſe of the prayers he had formerly offered, nor that form or pattern which he had given to his Diſciples; but finding his caſe to be then very ſingular, he mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly expoſtulates, not in the language of the whole
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:021967_0026_0FB659AFC94D31F0"/>
               <hi>Pſalm,</hi> but in part of the words of the firſt verſe. <hi>My God! my God! why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> I ſhall be judged by the unprejudiced, if the abettors of free prayer could wiſh for a ſtronger plea in their favor.</p>
            <p>YOUR next aſſertion is, that the Son of God hath "authorized ſtated forms of prayer by his command." The place indeed is not mentioned where this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is given, and I muſt own I do not recollect it; but as our Lord's comprehenſive prayer is immediately referred to, it is probable, that it relates to the manner in which one of the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> introduceth it.</p>
            <p>THIS prayer is indeed the beſt, the moſt full and perfect that ever was compoſed in the world; and if ever any form was intended to have been invariably uſed in the Chriſtian church, this was it: I will not preſume to iſſue the controverſy, whether the Bleſſed Author of it intended that we ſhould, in our devotions, word for word, abide by this <hi>Formula.</hi> I ſhall only of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a few things relating to this queſtion, leaving it to the judgment of the reader to determine as he pleaſeth.</p>
            <p>THAT it was only deſigned as a divine rule or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of prayer, not as a preciſe form, ſeems to appear from this conſideration:</p>
            <p>THAT our Bleſſed Saviour himſelf, as far as we can find, never ſo much as once uſed it, upon all thoſe various occaſions which he afterwards had of praying, to the Father; though it is very obſervable, and I have often remarked it with pleaſure, that the petitions he offered up, various as they were, are all of them redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, to one or other of thoſe, which are contained in his moſt excellent ſummary.</p>
            <p>AND as our Saviour did not, ſo we have no account that ever his apoſtles joined in the uſe of this prayer in their aſſemblies, or that they ſo much as once uſed it, though for themſelves and the church of God, the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions they offered, were likewiſe conformable to this divine pattern, which, in his excellent ſermon on the Mount, our Lord had ſhewed them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:021967_0027_0FB659B595EA69A0"/>BESIDES, had it been the intention of our Saviour, to bind his followers to the uſe of theſe words invari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, is it not probable that the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> would have recorded them without the leaſt variation? But this is not the caſe. In the fourth petition, St. <hi>Matthew</hi> hath it thus:<note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> vi. 11.</note> 
               <hi>give us this day our daily bread;</hi> St. <hi>Luke,</hi>

               <hi>Give us day by day our daily bread.</hi> The fifth petition is likewiſe differently worded. With the one <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> it ſtands thus:<note n="(c)" place="bottom">

               <hi>And forgive our ſins, for we alſo forgive every one that is indebted to us.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> liturgy varies from both, thus: <hi>Forgive us our treſpaſſes, as we forgive them that treſpaſs againſt us.</hi> And which is yet more conſiderable, the whole concluſion is omitted by St. <hi>Luke,</hi> which the other <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> hath in theſe words,<note n="(e)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> vi. 13.</note> 
               <hi>For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory for ever, Amen.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>FROM which compariſon it is a reaſonable preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that our bleſſed Lord in this prayer, intended no more than to give his diſciples, and all faithful <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to the end of the world, a divine directory—not an invariable form of devotion. Thus <hi>Auguſtine</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>One of the moſt judicious Criticks is of the mind, that theſe clauſes, <hi>which art in Heaven,</hi> and <hi>thy will be done, as in Heaven ſo in earth,</hi> and <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us from evil,</hi> were not originally in St. <hi>Luke's</hi> goſpel; but crept into i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
               </note> expreſsly declares, that "<hi>Chriſt</hi> in the delivery of theſe petitions, did not teach his diſciples how they ſhould ſpeak, or what words they ſhould uſe in prayer; but to whom they were to pray, and what things they were to pray for, when engaged in the exerciſe of ſecret or men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal prayer." And therefore while in o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> of the <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>when ye pray, ſay,</hi> &amp;c. The other hath

it, <hi>after this manner pray ye.</hi> If we take this as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs command of our Lord, whenever we pray, to uſe this form, it will prove that we ought never to uſe any other expreſſions in our addreſſes to God, than thoſe in this prayer. Nor ſhould we aſk a bleſſing to our victuals, or give thanks, without it. This would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the uſe of all other forms whatſoever.</p>
            <p>BESIDES, there are ſome men of learning, who hold that this prayer of our Lord was not deſigned for the perpetual uſe of the church, but only for a temporary form: To this purpoſe they obſerve, that the three firſt petitions, <hi>hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done,</hi> &amp;c ſeem to be calculated chiefly for the dawn of the Chriſtian Church; for that period, when according to the doctrine of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his forerunner, and to the expectation of the pious <hi>Jews, the kingdom of God was at hand.</hi> They obſerve farther, that in the petition for forgiveneſs of ſins, there is not the leaſt mention made of the ſacrifice, the death, or blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in virtue whereof we muſt now ſue for pardon; whereas our Saviour, after his reſurrection and aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is every where propoſed, as our High Prieſt, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, Interceſſor and Advocate, of which there is no notice taken in this form. And therefore they ſuppoſe that, upon this account, a conſiderable time after it's delivery, our Lord tells his diſciples, <hi>hitherto have ye aſked nothing in my name, aſk and ye ſhall receive.</hi> They obſerve likewiſe that the <hi>Doxologies</hi> mentioned in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture after our Saviour's aſcenſion, lead us directly and expreſsly, to aſcribe our praiſes to God by Chriſt, or in his name, of which there is not the leaſt hint in our Lord's prayer. Theſe are the obſervations of men who hold it as a form, ſuited chiefly to the ſtate of the Diſciples, while under our Saviour's perſonal mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry.

as we can learn, have commanded the very words of this prayer to be uſed, though this may be done with profit; but the original deſign ſeems to be, that the matter of our prayers, ſhould be deduced from thence.</p>
            <p>I SHALL now, Sir, purſue the hiſtory of prayer through the ſubſequent periods of the Church, that it may appear how groundleſs, how inconſiſtent with all truth your aſſertion is, "that the preſent extemporary way of worſhip, is contrary to the practice and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of all mankind in all ages, &amp;c. until it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced amidſt the ferment and confuſion of the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth century."</p>
            <p>IN all the accounts we have of the ardent devotions of the Apoſtles and pious Martyrs, whether for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or their fellow-ſufferers, none of them are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the ſame words, nor any of them in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs phraſes of our Lord's prayer, or of the prayers uſed by ſuch as were before them in the ſame circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
            <p>AFTER our Lord's aſcenſion, it was the conſtant and laudable practice of the Church, to aſſemble for the ſolemn acts of devotion, and to eat and to drink in remembrance of his paſſion. But where do we find the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> liturgy? In what <hi>book</hi> or <hi>chapter</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament?</hi> The ſubſtance of many devotional exerciſes are recorded, but not a ſyllable to countenance the opinion that they prayed by a preſcribed form. The moſt eminent names of the three firſt <hi>centuries</hi> might here be mentioned as a perfect illuſtration of this truth. Theſe primitive profeſſors of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> faith, under the moſt cruel tortures, ceaſed not the higheſt acts of devotion and charity, offering up their ſeveral prayers for the ſuffering church, and even for their tormentors and enemies; but never ſervilely followed, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly preſcribed to others, in an Exerciſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their own hearts, and the particular circumſtances of their ſeparate communities were principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:021967_0030_0FB659BC22FBFA78"/>AS for the apoſtles of our Lord, though they have perfected the ſum of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> doctrine, and though they had undoubtedly the beſt right to preſcribe a ſtated invariable form of worſhip, which at all times would ſuit the church and the individuals of it, yet they have left this matter free and undetermined. And as for the liturgies which bear the names of St. <hi>James</hi> and St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and ſome other of the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> it is very well known, and acknowledged by the greateſt friends of eſtabliſhed forms, that they are falſe and ſpurious<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>See <hi>Echard's</hi> Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding this, I am ſorry to find an eminent Divine, and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of the church of <hi>England,</hi> mentioning theſe ſcandalous forgeries, as if they were of the moſt undoubted authority. See the Preface to the <hi>Chriſtian Liturgy,</hi> pages, 5, 6, 7.</p>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>IF it be ſaid, that the Apoſtles were inſpired, and therefore did not ſtand in need of any form, I anſwer, that their qualifications by Inſpiration, rendered them the fitter to preſcribe and impoſe a Liturgy for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture uſe of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church, if they had thought this neceſſary.</p>
            <p>BUT induſtrious as they were, to promote the cauſe of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> we do not find that ever they attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to enſlave men's minds in any yoke of bondage. We have each of them in his own words offering up his own requeſts, and none of them tied down to any form; as might be inſtanced in the prayer that was put up by the Church, after the Diſciples, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> had been impriſoned, examined, threatened and diſmiſſed by the <hi>Jewiſh Sanhedrim.</hi> After this we have likewiſe an account of <hi>Stephen's</hi> perſecution, of his moſt rational defence, pious and devout behaviour, and patient martyrdom; but his petitions being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in other words than thoſe of the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned prayer, and ſuch as his peculiar circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and truly <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ſpirit dictated, we may be fully aſſured, that he had no notion of any preconceived form; and if he had thought that even the recital of our Lord's prayer was abſolutely neceſſary, he would not have omitted it, and gone to death, offering up on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:021967_0031_0FB659C829B421D8"/>
his own petitions. The ſame may be obſerved of the devout addreſſes of the apoſtles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> ſuited to the ſtate of the ſeveral churches they wrote to, and conceived in their own language.<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <p>Two very plain evidences of this conduct in the firſt followers of our Lord, we have on record. The one is, when they were about to chooſe on apoſtle to ſucceed in the room of <hi>Judas,</hi> when they prayed and ſaid, <hi>Thou, Lord, which knoweſt the hearts of all men, ſhew whether of the two thou haſt choſen:</hi> the other at the chooſing of the Deacons.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt of theſe inſtances, we have the very prayer recorded which the apoſtles uſed, and which is not the Lord's Prayer, but one particularly ſuited to the occaſion. And the ſame may reaſonably be ſuppoſed concerning the ſecond, tho' the prayer they uſed is not diſtinctly mentioned.</p>

            <p>INDEED every honeſt enquirer after truth muſt be fully ſatisfied, that the method of addreſſing the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being, uſed by the church of <hi>Scotland</hi> and its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, had an earlier and ſurer foundation than what you are pleaſed to aſcribe it to, "the ferment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of the fifteenth century."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:021967_0033_0FB659CB1CBE5A48"/>BUT pray, Sir, what was this ferment and confuſion? Where was it? And how did it ſerve to introduce the preſent extemporary way of worſhip? This, Sir, is gratifying your remarkable genius; for I am perſuaded that the hiſtorians of that age will leave it ſolely to your own invention, to make out proper anſwers to theſe queſtions. And, if we may judge from your paſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, it is not to be doubted, but you will yet convince the world, that the <hi>Blackſmith</hi> can never be at a loſs for <hi>forgeries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is plain, Sir, that in talking of "the ferment and confuſion of the fifteenth century," you intend to caſt a ſlur upon the reformation in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ſo far you ſerve the <hi>Popiſh</hi> cauſe; though you are out in your <hi>chronology;</hi> for it was not 'till about the middle of the ſixteenth century that the reformation took place there. And if there was any ferment or confuſion at that time, which was principally owing to the oppoſition of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> faction, and the cruel and perfidious methods they made uſe of, as this did not hinder the church of <hi>Scotland</hi> from throwing off the errors and corruptions of <hi>Popery,</hi> ſo it did not hinder them from ſettling their doctrine and worſhip in that manner which they judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moſt conformable to the firſt and pureſt times of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> church.</p>
            <p>IT appears from what has been offered, that the moſt primitive and ſcriptural method of addreſs, when we approach the Supreme Being, is by what is commonly called <hi>extempore</hi> or free prayer.</p>
            <p>IF it is duly conſidered, this alſo will be found the moſt natural way. All divine acceptable prayer, it is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhould take its riſe from the heart, and ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive its firſt formation there. But when words are preſcribed, the natural order is inverted; the affections are brought to the words, inſtead of the words flowing from the affections. Something of this is experienced by perſons truly devout: they are often proſtrate before God, pouring forth their hearts with an overflowing
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:021967_0034_0FB659CEC80613C0"/>
and indulgence of expreſſion, which exceeds all the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of oratory. Theſe are not "rude and ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcenes, blaſphemous petitions," as you, Sir,<note n="§" place="bottom">Blackſmith's Letter, p. <hi>46.</hi>
               </note> are pleaſed overhaſtily to call them, when you tell us, that you have "often trembled to ſee the ignorant, proud Enthuſiaſt approach his Maker, with as great familiarity as he would his neighbour, and kneel down with his family to his extemporary worſhip." There is no doubt, but that the ignorance and weakneſs of ſome, may need the aſſiſtance of ſet forms; eſpecially when they pray with others; and therefore ſuch helps are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and recommended to them. But after all, we muſt obſerve, that the rules of grammar and oratory, are none of the eſſential parts of prayer. The ſpirit of God may be ſent forth to help the infirmities of his children, and to enable them to pray; it may ſoften the heart, warm the affections, and teach them to cry, <hi>Abba Father!</hi> But we do not ſay, that it will teach them the beauties of rhetoric, or an eaſy flowing ſtyle; for as theſe are too mean to have any ſtreſs laid upon them by wiſe or good men, much leſs by the Almighty. <hi>Out of the mouths of babes and ſucklings,</hi> of weak and illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate <hi>Chriſtians, he can perfect</hi> his own <hi>praiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>GOD <hi>ſees not as man ſees;</hi> he has not thoſe views of what entertains our ſenſes, nor thoſe affections and deſires towards them which we have. We may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the elegancy of a form; with devotion pompous and magnificent; with curious ſculptures, nice paintings, and the melody of ſounds; but to think thus of Him, <hi>who dwells not in temples made with hands,</hi> is no leſs ſenſual, groſs and irrational in us, than un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of Him who is an infinitely pure ſpirit.</p>
            <p>THE language in which he is addreſſed, may be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and uncouth, but <hi>ſuch pity as a father ſheweth unto his children, ſuch pity ſheweth the Lord to them that fear Him;</hi> and he that <hi>uttereth the truth in his heart,</hi> though his words are not the moſt accurate, yet they
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:021967_0035_0FB659DB0F06A248"/>
are not the leaſt acceptable. Even among men, an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate tender parent, will not deſpiſe the juſt and dutiful requeſts of his child, though the words are but half pronounced. And <hi>if we that are evil, know how to</hi> treat our offspring in this manner; who dare ſay what that addreſs is, which ſhall be rejected by the Almighty? But eſpecially, who dare ſay, that the prayer which proceeds from upright intentions, and a broken ſenſible heart, though it be but lamely uttered, ſhall not find acceptance?</p>
            <p>I ALLOW that it is neceſſary and commendable in us to endeavour that our wants and deſires ſhould be expreſſed by ſuitable words: Sometimes the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved <hi>Chriſtians</hi> may labor under a preſent deadneſs of ſpirit, and indiſpoſedneſs for any exerciſe, that may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire much attention. In ſuch diſagreeable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that they may aptly and pertinently expreſs themſelves, it is very neceſſary that the matter, as well as the order of their addreſſes, ſhould for ſome time before they engage in this duty, be much thought upon. Then, he who hath made any tolerable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in religion, who hath been converſant with the holy ſcriptures, and with divine ſubjects; but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially who hath ſtudied his own heart, and its various frames; will, through that grace which is ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon him who aſketh it aright, eaſily ſurmount all preſent languor, and gain divine enlargement in this duty.</p>
            <p>OTHERS who have their minds furniſhed very poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with ideas, or who through diſuſe may have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted an utter inability for this ſervice, may perhaps find their thoughts better expreſſed in precompoſed forms, and may receive conſiderable benefits from them.<note n="*" place="bottom">That this is agreeable to the ſentiments of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> may be ſeen, if the reader will give himſelf the trouble of conſulting the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly's</hi> Directory—page <hi>9.</hi> Direct. <hi>9. London</hi> Edition.</note> But for more improved <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to confine themſelves to ſuch forms, would be (to uſe the words of the learned Biſhop <hi>Wilkins</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Wilkins</hi> Gift of Prayer.</note>) "As if a man, who
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:021967_0036_0FB659DC5C981D38"/>
had once need of crutches, ſhould always afterwards make uſe of them, and ſo neceſſitate himſelf to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual impotency."</p>
            <p>THOSE who cannot go without them, may make uſe of them; but a little aſſiduity in the exerciſe of prayer, and ſome farther acquaintance with God and their own hearts, will, in time, furniſh, even weak <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> both with matter and words, without ſuch aſſiſtances.</p>
            <p>THE occurrences, for inſtance, of every day, as the mercies, trials, temptations, and deliverances of it, will furniſh matter for prayer. In the morning, the view and proſpect of what is before us, or may befall us, will lead our addreſſes; and in the evening, if we have received ſignal favors, or have eſcaped imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, or have felt the prevalency of temptations, our devotion will favor of theſe things. In a word, as our hearts are uſually formed according to our occaſions and circumſtances, theſe are ſo very variable, that our prayers cannot be always the ſame, without being, to ſay no worſe, leſs natural and pertinent.</p>
            <p>WHEN we are reduced to great extremity, and know not where to flee for relief, how natural is it to ſeek ſhelter under the ſhadow of the Divine wings? When, with the diſciples, we are in danger of ſhipwreck; or, with <hi>Paul</hi> for our rebelliouſneſs, to be <hi>ſtruck down to the earth;</hi> how apt are we to be inſtant and earneſt in our applications for mercy and ſalvation? It cannot be ſaid of the former, that their earneſt addreſs, <hi>help, Lord, elſe we periſh;</hi> or of the latter, whoſe firſt petition was, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> I ſay, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be affirmed, that theſe were the reſult of ſtudy or premeditation; or that they were parts of precompoſed collects: Yet the prayer-hearing God did not reject theſe "<hi>extempore</hi> effuſions;" hereby inviting us always to conſider his providences, and to ſuit our petitions accordingly."</p>
            <p>BUT beſides theſe extraordinary occurrences, there may be other caſes, wherein it would be very improper <pb n="38" facs="unknown:021967_0037_0FB659DDE292C0F8"/>
that our devotion ſhould be fettered with form. A well-prepared mind, that hath a perfect comprehenſion of its own ſtate, as well as of what relates to the church of God, or to the civil community, of which he is a member; and hath been long exerciſed, ſometimes with much enlargement and ſucceſs, in this duty of prayer, cannot be diverted from it, 'till he is authoriſed by law and form to begin it. Though all men ſhould be ſilent, he will take with him words, and, as the caſe requireth, ſupplicate the ſupreme Over-ruler.</p>
            <p>I CANNOT better expreſs my ſentiments upon this point, than in the language of the excellent Prelate<note n="*" place="bottom">Biſhop <hi>Wilkins'</hi> Gift of Prayer, p. <hi>12.</hi>
               </note>, before referred to. "What one ſaith of counſel to be had from books, <hi>may be fitly applied,</hi>" ſaith he, "to this prayer by book: That it is commonly, of itſelf, ſomething flat and dead; floating, for the moſt part, too much in generalities, and not particular enough for each ſeveral occaſion. There is not that life and vigor in it to engage the affections, as when it proceeds immediately from the ſoul itſelf, and is the natural ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of thoſe particulars whereof we are moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. And if it be a fault, not to ſtrive and labor after this gift, much more is it to <hi>jeer</hi> and <hi>deſpiſe</hi> it, by the name of <hi>extempore prayer,</hi> and <hi>praying by the ſpirit;</hi> which expreſſions, as they are frequently uſed by ſome men, by way of reproach, are, for the moſt part, the ſign of <hi>a profane heart,</hi> and ſuch as are altogether ſtrangers to the power and comfort of this duty."</p>
            <p>HERE, Sir, by the Pen of an impartial Writer, you are plainly characterized: For the Agency of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in this ſolemn Service, is what you are pleaſed, boldly, to ridicule<note n="†" place="bottom">Blackſmith's Letter, p. <hi>47, 48.</hi>
               </note>. "In the Name of God," you ſay, "do you believe that you are inſpired? And, again, "have you ſo little regard to the honor of God, and the Intereſts of religion, as to aſcribe your extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary effuſions to the Holy Spirit?" And, again, if the matter of them be inſpired, your Prayers are of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:021967_0038_0FB659DF59E95CA0"/>
authority with the Scriptures themſelves, and ſhould be entered into the Canon."</p>
            <p>IN anſwer to which, I ſhall obſerve, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders of free prayer always diſtinguiſh between the ſpirit and the gift of prayer. By the ſpirit of prayer, they underſtand thoſe inward holy deſires and devout affections which the Holy Spirit forms and excites in the minds of good men, and which are the Life and ſoul of our external ſervices. By the gift of prayer, they underſtand, an ability of chuſing ſuitable matter, and offering it up to God, in expreſſions fit to repreſent our inward pious deſires on all emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. The gift may be the effect of pains, applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and frequent exerciſe in this duty; and may be poſſeſſed by thoſe who are deſtitute of the Spirit of Prayer. Where the Gift is wanting, which, in any <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> is a very great defect, Forms are allowable, and the Holy Spirit may be aſſiſting, in ſuch caſes, as well as where ſuch helps are not uſed. But thoſe who are bleſſed with the Gift, may have, alſo, the aſſiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Spirit, exciting their devout affections, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightening their minds to underſtand their ſpiritual ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, and directing them in the matter of their prayers, by bringing the promiſes of God to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance; ſtrengthening and elevating their natural powers to a more vigorous exerciſe, and helping them againſt their manifold infirmities.</p>
            <p>THIS much ſeemeth to be included in what the ſcriptures declare concerning the Spirit's agency in this duty. Thus <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 26.—<hi>Likewiſe the Spirit alſo helpeth our Infirmities; for we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought; but the Spirit itſelf maketh interceſſion for us, with groanings which cannot be utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> "The Spirit of God," ſaith Dr. <hi>Whitly,</hi> "is ſaid to intercede for us, not as an Advocate or Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor betwixt God and us, that being the office of our Great High Prieſt; but as an <hi>Exciter</hi> or <hi>Director</hi> of us in our addreſſes to God, to render them, for matter, according to the will of God; and, for <hi>manner,</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:021967_0039_0FB659E0DF7C68D8"/>
fervent and effectual." "<hi>Chriſt</hi> only," ſaith the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Biſhop <hi>Wilkins</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Gift of Prayer, p. <hi>45.</hi>
               </note>, "in reſpect of his merits and Sufferings, does make <hi>interceſſion for us:</hi> But, becauſe the Spirit of God does excite our hearts to pray, and infuſe in us holy deſires; ſtirring us up to, and inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us in, our duty; therefore he is ſaid to intercede for us."</p>
            <p>THIS is all that, on this head, is maintained by the reformed churches, who plead for free prayer.</p>
            <p>YOU alledge, Sir<note n="†" place="bottom">Blackſmith's Letter, p. <hi>53.</hi>
               </note>, that "the only inſpiration pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in ſcripture, that is neceſſary, or that can be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, is, that the Holy Spirit will inſpire the hearts of the faithful with <hi>affections</hi> proper for this important duty; ſuch as ſhame and ſorrow in confeſſion, an humble Chriſtian hope of obtaining what we aſk in our petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, gratitude and love in our Thankſgivings, and ſuch other affections as are ſuitable to the ſeveral parts of Prayer." And I would only obſerve upon it, that he who is bleſſed with the frame for praying, and whoſe affections are, in this manner, enlivened and quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will not want a form. Upon this account (as <hi>a Spirit of Grace and Supplication</hi>) the Holy Ghoſt is promiſed to the Church.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Gal.</hi> iv. 6.—<hi>Becauſe ye are ſons, God hath ſent forth the ſpirit of his Son into your hearts, crying</hi> abba, <hi>Father.</hi> And <hi>Eph.</hi> v. 18.—<hi>Be filled with the ſpirit, ſpeaking to yourſelves in pſalms and hymns, and ſpiritual ſongs, ſinging and making melody in your hearts to the Lord; giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father, in the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And Chap. vi. 18. —<hi>Praying always, with all prayer and ſupplication, in the ſpirit, and watching thereunto with all perſeverance, and ſupplication for all ſaints.</hi> So the Apoſtle <hi>Jude,</hi> in his general epiſtle, at the 20th <hi>verſe. But ye, beloved, build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up yourſelves in your moſt holy faith,</hi> praying in the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>keep yourſelves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt unto eternal life.</hi>

               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:021967_0040_0FB659E8AC99D8C0"/>I AM well aware that ſome interpret theſe texts ſo as to leave the preſent church little or no intereſt in them; placing all that is here promiſed among the CHARISMATA, or extraordinary gifts of the ſpirit, conferred on the firſt <hi>Chriſtian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and that they were not to extend beyond the age of inſpiration. But ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters have, and will have, the misfortune of the happy experience of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in every age againſt them. I confeſs, (ſaith a late ingenious author)<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Watts.</hi> See his Guide to Prayer, p. <hi>175.</hi>
               </note> "that the Holy Spirit hath been, in a great meaſure, ſo long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from his churches, that we are tempted to think all his promiſed operations, peculiar to the firſt ages of <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> and it was from this abſence of the ſpirit, that men proceeded to invent various methods to ſupply the want of him in prayer; as by <hi>Pater Noſters,</hi> beads, litanies, and other forms, ſome good, ſome bad; to which, that they might keep up a form of worſhip, and the attention of the people, the churches were confined."</p>
            <p>I WOULD not be thought to inſinuate that the Divine Spirit doth never afford his aſſiſtance in the uſe of forms; I am only accounting for that diſreſpect which men are apt to ſhew at the doctrine of the aſſiſtances of the ſpirit; and what I would be underſtood to mean is, that the promiſes of the goſpel, with reſpect to theſe aſſiſtances, may be hoped for and experienced by all true <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to the end of the world.</p>
            <p>AND here, let it be further obſerved, that among all the extraordinary gifts of the ſpirit<note n="†" place="bottom">Joel ii. 28.</note> propheſied by <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> prayer is not mentioned; the words are, <hi>I will pour out my ſpirit upon all fleſh, and your ſons and daughters ſhall propheſy, your old men ſhall dream dreams, your young men ſhall ſee viſions; and alſo upon the ſervants, and upon the handmaids, in theſe days will I pour out my Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. And in the ſecond chapter of the <hi>Acts of the apoſtles,</hi> where this propheſy is recited, as having its accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, prayer is not mentioned as any of thoſe extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary or miraculous powers which were then ſhed
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:021967_0041_0FB659EB5B73FFF8"/>
forth by the influences of the ſpirit. Neither is it ſo mentioned in any part of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> except in one place<note n="†" place="bottom">See St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Enumeration, <hi>1</hi> Cor. <hi>xii.</hi>
               </note>, where the gift of tongues, in that they were able to expreſs themſelves in languages they had never learned, ſeems to be referred to, rather than the gift of prayer. If, then, it is not to be found among the extraordinary or miraculous, it muſt belong to the ordinary or more common influences or operations of the ſpirit; which were to extend to all the periods of the church, and to all the individuals which compoſe <hi>Chriſt's</hi> myſtical body to the end of the world.</p>
            <p>BY theſe ſacred powers which are communicated to all ſincere <hi>chriſtians,</hi> though there is nothing <hi>new</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to them, or what might amount to inſpiration; yet the truths, the laws, and rules which were formerly revealed, are brought to their remembrance. And to this purpoſe are ſeveral of the promiſes relating to this bleſſed <hi>paraclete,</hi> which we read of in the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF, then, the continuance of the ordinary operations of the ſpirit, is a thing promiſed to, and to be expected by, the body of believing <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> to the end of time; the ridicule of inſpiration muſt be, at leaſt, ſenſeleſs and ſtupid; perhaps it may be, in ſome degree, impious.</p>
            <p>HAVING thus collected and faithfully repreſented what the abettors of free prayer maintain, reſpecting the Holy Spirit and its influences, I ſhall now proceed to obviate ſuch other complaints as you have offered againſt this manner of worſhip.</p>
            <p>"IN our congregations, you ſay<note n="*" place="bottom">Blackſmith's Letter, p. <hi>24.</hi>
               </note>, the mouth runs before the mind, and ſpeaks, without giving us any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of thinking what we ought to ſpeak, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſays things that we ſhould certainly reject, and ſometimes offers petitions that we ſhould abſolutely abhor, had we time calmly to examine them: Our mouth leads us into the groſs blunder of preſenting our addreſſes to the Deity firſt, and next judging whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:021967_0042_0FB659EE90466990"/>
they be proper addreſſes, after they are offered, when we cannot mend what is wrong, or alter what is improper." You even make it a queſtion<note n="†" place="bottom">Blackſmith's Letter, p. <hi>33</hi> and <hi>56.</hi>
               </note>, "Whether the laity can join at all in our public prayers; for we muſt either ſuppoſe that they go along with the miniſter, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering every word as he utters it, or wait until he has finiſhed the ſentence, and then examine it, and give their aſſent."</p>
            <p>To call this cavilling, rather than reaſoning, is not improper. If a miniſter hath been regularly and duly called and appointed to his office, it is not doubted, except with the atheiſtical herd, that he has a right, among other of his ſacred miniſtrations, to offer up prayers and ſupplications, with thankſgivings, in behalf of thoſe among whom he officiates. If this is the caſe, then, that which is the moſt natural and ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral manner of addreſs, hath been already ſhewed.</p>
            <p>To ſay, that in this kind of publick worſhip, "The mouth runs before the mind, and offers petitions which ſhould be rejected," is, at the beſt, but a reflection, both on the laity and clergy, equally impolite and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt. To the laity, it denies that privilege in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, which is allowed them in all other affairs, relative to reaſonable beings. In our mutual conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation and commerce, we find very few, except among thoſe who are void of underſtanding, but know per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well where to yield their aſſent, or diſſent. Even the moſt untutored ear can diſtinguiſh between harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and diſcord; and it needs no proof, that the action of the mind is equally quick, whatever it be that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands its attention.</p>
            <p>HOW would it hamper all converſation, and how ſhould we be ſtraitened in the common offices of life, if we muſt firſt critically examine and nicely weigh every ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that is ſpoken to us, before we could give a ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able anſwer? And how altogether vain and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent would all the labor of the pulpit, or ſenate, or
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:021967_0043_0FB659EFE2B0DC00"/>
bar be, upon this ſuppoſition? If you do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what is ſpoken to you, it is indeed to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to addreſs you: And this diſtinguiſhing preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of ſpeech, whereby man is capable of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating his thoughts, for the improvement or enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of his fellow creatures, is no more than an empty name. Nay, it is worſe, if we admit your man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of reaſoning, Sir; for it would tend more to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex and to confound, than to enlighten and improve.</p>
            <p>TO ſay, that I cannot join in public ſervice, or in offering up my prayers; with the ſpeaker, to the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, becauſe I muſt either, in doing ſo, go along with him in every word that he utters, or wait till he hath finiſhed, and then give my aſſent to the whole; is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning much of the ſame ſtrength with that of the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, who ridiculouſly argued againſt motion, nearly in the ſame ſtyle—For, ſays he, "If I move, it muſt be either in the place where I am, or where I am not, but no body can move in the place where it is; for if it is there, it does not come out of it; nor in the place where it is not; for where it is not, it cannot act." A certain <hi>Cynic,</hi> gravely anſwered, by turning upon his heel, and walking to and fro through the apartment. The evidence of common ſenſe, Sir, is againſt your argument.</p>
            <p>SHOULD a miniſter be told by one of his pariſhioners, "Sir, it is to no purpoſe for me to attend your public miniſtrations; I am in no capacity to improve by them; you ſpeak, it is true, and it may be rationally enough; but if I am to receive benefit by your diſcourſes, my mind muſt either go along with every word; or I muſt examine every ſentence after it is ſpoken. The firſt would be acting too implicitly; the latter is not in my power; for before I have one ſentence half exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, you have well nigh finiſhed another, and the mind of man is not able to attend to ſo many things at once."—Would this reaſoning be admitted? and can the Preacher plead to be heard, and inſiſt upon it that he may be underſtood, when delivering a meſſage
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:021967_0044_0FB659F75314C400"/>
from God to men, and not when offering up prayers for men to God? Or ſhall the Laity be treated as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable beings in the one caſe, and diveſted of all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of reaſon and judgment, in the other? This muſt be looked upon, by the unprejudiced, as very unfair.</p>
            <p>IT may not be improper to obſerve further, upon this argument, that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in reaſoning againſt prayers in an unknown tongue, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xiv.) goes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſuppoſition, that when a man prays in a known tongue, in the public Aſſembly, it may be to the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the hearers. But according to your way of arguing, Sir, it would be to no purpoſe for him to pray in public at all, though in a known tongue, if it were not in a ſtated preſcribed form; ſince people could not be edified, or receive any benefit from it. And yet I believe the greateſt admirer of precompoſed, preſcribed forms, will ſcarce take upon him to affirm, that the prayers, the apoſtle there ſpeaks of, were of that kind.</p>
            <p>AS for reflections upon thoſe who offer up our prayers, that their performances are "corrupted by the contrary petitions of contending parties; mixed with the whimſical opinions and pernicious principles of libertines and enthuſiaſts; rendered obſcure and contemptible by the pedantry and affected learning of the younger, or by the weakneſſes of the mind and body of the older miniſters; interlaid with ill-timed compliments to the great, with politicks and private piques and quarrels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>I WILL venture to affirm, Sir, that thoſe who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend conſtantly upon public worſhip, either in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or among proteſtant <hi>Diſſenters</hi> elſewhere, know that the accuſation advanced by you, as if the abuſes you mention were very frequent and even general, is abſolutely falſe.

upon your own word. But I ſuppoſe you have been converſant in ſuch authors as the <hi>Scotch Preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Eloquence,</hi> whoſe calumnies and miſrepreſentations have been long ſince detected and expoſed. There are thouſands of witneſſes that the prayers offered up in the public aſſemblies are generally ſuch as all <hi>chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> may join in, ſcriptural, grave, and decent. But there is this remarkable difference between thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to Liturgies, and thoſe that are not ſo; that, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing be wrong in a free, unpreſcribed prayer, it is eaſily amended, and the miſchief cannot go very far, or be long continued; but in a public preſcribed li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, if either improper expreſſions, or falſe doctrines, or ſuperſtitious and idolatrous ways of worſhip be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, they are bound down both upon Miniſters and People, and continue perhaps, to future ages.</p>

               </note> WE need go no further for inſtances of this, than the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church. Her <hi>Miſſals</hi> and <hi>Breviaries,</hi> and other forms of devotion, have been mainly inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in propagating and eſtabliſhing her falſe doctrines, Tranſubſtantiation, Purgatory, &amp;c. and her idolatrous and ſuperſtitious worſhip, ſuch as that which is paid to ſaints and angels, to images, and to the croſs. And all the inconveniences that have ever ariſen from the abuſe of what you call <hi>extempore</hi> effuſions, have not done the thouſandth part of the miſchief in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> church, that theſe preſcribed <hi>Liturgies</hi> have done. And as to improprieties of expreſſion, if you, Mr. <hi>Blackſmith,</hi> were
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:021967_0046_0FB659FB3AEE3A38"/>
as well acquainted with this controverſy, as I preſume you would be thought to be, you would know that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral improprieties have been obſerved even in that public liturgy, which probably you moſt admire. But I ſpare the mention of them; for they that ſo freely cenſure others, have often very tender ears when it comes to their own caſe.</p>
            <p>IT is almoſt unneceſſary further to add, that there are various gifts and men of different parts, in all <hi>chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> communities; but it would be very cruel to load the ſhoulders of the innocent, with the faults or fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the guilty. Should this unrighteous manner of cenſuring and condemning <hi>all,</hi> for the weakneſſes of a <hi>few,</hi> take place, what church upon earth could ſtand ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted?</p>
            <p>PETITIONS unſeaſonable or improper may by ſome be offered up; but it gives all the real friends of true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> liberty no ſmall conſolation, that they are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſitated by any preſcribed form to addreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with impropriety, nor to prefer petitions quite contrary to the real ſentiments of their hearts. They are neither hindered from what they ſhould ſay, nor obliged, by the uſe of a defective form, to ſpeak what they ſhould not ſay.</p>
            <p>YOU alledge, Sir, that "all dangers might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, and all deficiencies ſupplied, by compoſing and eſtabliſhing a pious form of prayer."—But if it be true, what hath been proved, that unconſtrained free prayer, is the moſt natural, primitive and ſcriptural manner of addreſs to our Maker; then to pray by form, to avoid improprieties, is the greateſt blunder we could commit.</p>
            <p>BESIDES, an unexceptionable form of human com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure, hath never yet appeared in the <hi>chriſtian</hi> church; and if any ſuch thing ſhould appear, it would be no ſecurity againſt blunders. In our neighbour church, though many of their prayers are the beſt that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in any public eſtabliſhed liturgy, yet there are

ſome of them not without their faults.<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <p>See alſo—<hi>Candid Diſquiſitions,</hi> where many things are laid before the Governors of the church, which well deſerve their ſerious conſideration; tho' the learned and candid authors, ſome of whom are ſaid to be of eminent note in the church of <hi>England,</hi> inſtead of being attended to, have not with oppoſition and reproach—And this is one inſtance, among many, that might be brought to ſhew how difficult it is, when once a public liturgy is eſtabliſhed by authority, to get any alterations made in it, however requiſite, and only intended to render it more perfect and unexceptionable.</p>
               </note> And in the reading of the very beſt, conſiderable miſtakes have happened, and may every day happen, owing to inat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, or ſome worſe cauſe. I could give undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inſtances to this purpoſe, if I choſe to imitate, Sir, your <hi>genteel</hi> manner of writing.</p>
            <p>BUT what is ſtill more conſiderable, the compoſing, eſtabliſhing and impoſing of a Form of Prayer, though more unexceptionable than hath hitherto appeared, would yet be an unjuſtifiable infringement on the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of <hi>chriſtians.</hi> There is not one text in all the Bible which impowers any man, or ſet of men, to preſcribe to me the very words which at all times, and in all circumſtances, I am to offer up to God. The apoſtles, though under the conduct of the Divine Spirit, never attempted ſuch a thing, as hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved. They offered up their addreſſes, ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their own conceptions. And ſince they have not preſcribed to the church, in this inſtance, for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſpired men to do it, muſt, I think, border upon preſumption.</p>
            <p>IF, therefore, there neither is, nor can in truth be, any ſuch thing as a perfect, invariable form of human compoſure; if ſuch a form, could it be deviſed, would not prevent miſtakes; but above all, if the impoſing of it, would be inconſiſtent with the rights of <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> there is no reaſon why it ſhould be complied with: And the remedy you propoſe, Sir, would be of more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous conſequence than the evil complained of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="unknown:021967_0048_0FB65A01DFAE88E0"/>IF it is alledged that, in the natural order of things, the congregation ſhould firſt be ſatisfied, that the prayers to be offered in their name are proper and juſt, and ſuch as they can with freedom join in; otherwiſe they cannot pray in faith.—I anſwer, that we are required to hear, as well as to pray <hi>in faith;</hi> but according to this way of reaſoning, before a Sermon is delivered, it ſhould always undergo the previous examination of thoſe that are to hear it, otherwiſe it cannot be profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. If it be ſaid, that this is carrying the matter too far; I anſwer, that the underſtandings of men are employed, and their rational aſſent required, no more in the one caſe than in the other.</p>
            <p>IN ſupport of your argument you ſay<note n="*" place="bottom">Blackſmith's Letter, page <hi>25.</hi>
               </note>, that "ſhould the ableſt member of the Houſe of Commons propoſe to offer an addreſs to his Majeſty, in the name of the houſe, without communicating it to the members, the impropriety would be immediately perceived."

            <p>BUT I ſhall put the caſe a little ſtronger, and more to the purpoſe: ſuppoſing a ſet of men, whoſe ſkill in politics was very deep, ſhould (without any authority from the ſovereign for ſo doing) take upon them to draw up a form or forms of addreſs, which ſhould always be preſented to him in the ſame words, let the nature of government, or the exigencies of corporations and kingdoms vary as they pleaſe; would not the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety then be very ſtriking?

               </note>, that in extraordinary caſes, as <hi>in war, famine</hi> or <hi>peſtilence,</hi> you might have added, in peace, health, and plenty, <hi>proper forms may be provided.</hi> And we ſee that in the church where forms are authorized, they are in ſuch caſes provided. Now, Sir, I beſeech you, be a righteous judge in this matter: What do the people in general, who, upon public Faſt or Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving days, offer up their prayers or praiſes by form, know before-hand of what ſhall be preſcribed them? Some few perhaps in the <hi>Metropolis,</hi> where they are publiſhed, may have examined and conſidered, before they joined in them; but in country places, very few, but the miniſters of pariſhes, know any thing of them, 'till they hear them when they are offered. Yet would it not be very uncharitable to ſay, that thoſe who are not previouſly acquainted with them, or who have not maturely examined them, cannot with propriety join in ſuch addreſſes?</p>
            <p>IN ſcripture we have frequent inſtances of public prayer; but that the people were unacquainted with them, was not, neither can it be, a prejudice to true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.

As a man may, in his judgment, aſſent unto any divine truth delivered in a ſermon which he never heard before, ſo may he join in his affections to a holy deſire in a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he never heard before. If he, who is the mouth of the reſt, deliver, through imprudence, what we cannot approve of, God does not look upon it as our prayer,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:021967_0050_0FB65A0EF18BAF70"/>
if our deſires do not ſay AMEN to it."—The ſenſe of this good man thus expreſſed, if ſeriouſly conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Sir, will appear a ſufficient anſwer to many of your cavils.</p>
            <p>I SHALL obſerve further, that the matter of prayer is ſo very plain, as not to ſtand in need of that nice mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute enquiry which you ſpeak of. The humble <hi>Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> who has made it the buſineſs and delight of his ſoul to attend public worſhip, is not unacquainted with the proper order and method, as well as with the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of prayer. He knoweth, for inſtance, his ſins, wants, and mercies, as ſoon as they are named; and though theſe things are put into words that he has not been accuſtomed to hear, yet this does not require any time to deliberate whether the confeſſions, petitions, or thankſgivings ſuited to the common infirmities, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and enjoyments of all, are proper to be offered up to the Almighty; he heartily joins in them, and reaps the benefit.</p>
            <p>BUT his comfort and benefit are doubled, if he is ſo happy as to hear his own particular <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aſe laid before the Almighty, which, perhaps, he had in confidence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded to his miniſter, earneſtly requeſting his prayers and thoſe of the church upon it; or which he, whoſe buſineſs it is to watch over the flock, had by ſome other means attained to the knowledge of. A privilege and pleaſure this, from which, by ſtated forms, he muſt have been for ever excluded.</p>
            <p>YOUR argument is ſtill further urged by alledging<note n="*" place="bottom">Blackſmith's Letter, pages <hi>63, 64.</hi>
               </note>, that "if forms are unlawful, we are unlawfully bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, for that is done by a form.—We adminiſter the Lord's ſupper in an unlawful manner, for we do it by a form, I mean the words of the firſt inſtitution: We are diſmiſſed every Lord's day with an unlawful bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; for one of the ſolemn forms with which the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles conclude their epiſtles, is always uſed upon that
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:021967_0051_0FB65A126A98FFB0"/>
occaſion. Further, if forms of prayer be not accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to God, and an uſeful way of worſhip for ourſelves, we groſsly offend every time we meet in church; for it is impoſſible to ſing eighteen or twenty lines of a pſalm, but we offer ſome important petition by a form."</p>
            <p>I ANSWER, that for all theſe matters we have divine authority and example. And no concluſion can be drawn from thoſe parts of our ſolemn public ſervices, thus warranted, to enforce forms which are deſtitute of ſuch warrant or authority. Otherwiſe all the <hi>Ave Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias,</hi> beads, and trumpery of the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> may plead for admiſſion upon the ſame footing, and with equal ſhew of reaſon.</p>
            <p>YOU alledge further<note n="*" place="bottom">Blackſmith's Letter, page <hi>65.</hi>
               </note>, that "if our laity pray in the ſame words of the miniſter, they are as much confined to a form, as any other people; for if the miniſter ſays, <hi>Moſt gracious God, forgive us our ſins, preſerve us from danger, and provide for our neceſſities:</hi> if the people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat theſe words, either in their minds, or with their mouths, or both; it is evident that they pray as much by a form, as if the prayer had been compoſed a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years ago."—But, Sir, can that be a form to any, which is not ſo in itſelf, nor to him that pronounces it? Let any man of common ſenſe aſk himſelf, what is meant by a form? Whether it does not include in it the conſtant uſe of the ſame method, manner and words; and then this quibble of your's, will appear very vain and frivolous.</p>
            <p>IF it be found that any miniſter, as far as your cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure reaches, ſatisfies himſelf with a form, let it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered that this form is not impoſed upon other churches; and even, among thoſe where it is uſed, it is ſubject to the ſame diſguſt which thoſe human compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures give, that are over and over repeated. This would not be endured at the Theatre, or at the Bar; and we have as good a right to look for variety, and to expect

to meet with men of parts, among thoſe that are of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred character. For my own part, I ſhall honeſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it as my private opinion, that ſuch as are incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of uſing free prayer, without apparent hazard of rendering it contemptible by their indecent manner of performing it, ſhould not be admitted to the miniſtry.<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <p>His <hi>hue and cry</hi> about the dangers to which the people are expoſed from public prayers offered without ſome preſcribed form—ſeeks all its ſupport from the mean and malicious arts of ſlander and abuſe:—by which he ſtruggles, with all his might, to hold up the whole body of the <hi>Preſbyterian Clergy,</hi> as a banditti of abandoned and unprincipled known:—whoſe chief qualifications are groſs ignorance—impudent effrontry —over-weening pride—unhallowed paſſions—low malice—party rage—and mad enthuſiaſm. The poor man has been very unhappy in the choice of his ſubject: The character of that body of men is too long, and too publickly known, to be hurt by the impotent weapons of the Blackſmith:—And to thoſe, who may yet be ſtrangers to the men, it will be a ſufficient anſwer to his calumnies, to know, that in no church on earth, are greater pains taken to prepare man for the office of the Miniſtry, than in the Church of <hi>Scotland;</hi> Beſides the uſual time ſpent in the courſe of philoſophical Studies, &amp;c. in the Univerſity,—the public rule requires ſix years to be employed in the <hi>Divinity-hall;</hi> under the inſtruction of an approved public <hi>Profeſſor:</hi>—af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, their courſe of trials before the <hi>Preſbytery</hi> can rarely be finiſhed in ſix months, before they can be licenced to preach.—Then do they continue to exerciſe their talents, only at the direction of the Preſbytery, until they have received calls to ſettle in particular charges:—when that takes place, they have to paſs as many trials before the Preſbytery, as at their being firſt licenced,—and after their ordination, they are ſtill liable to be called to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for every thing complained of, either in their public performances, or private walk in life:—and a ſingle Preſbytery can depoſe them from office, whenever found unworthy of it.</p>
                  <p>This is the church-government under which the Blackſmith thinks the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are in more danger, than under that of <hi>Rome</hi> itſelf! with all theſe guards of the pulpit-door, he is ſure no man enters it, who is fit to be entruſted to make one prayer in public! If he does, it is at the hazard of their ſouls for the people to join him! Nor can they be ſafe by withholding their conſent when they hear a wrong petition offered—ſince the Deity will be likely to miſtake it ſtill for theirs, and charge it to their account! Sad caſe indeed! A caſe which, it ſeems, admits no remedy but a <hi>Liturgy;</hi> with all the reſponſes, Collects, Ave-Marias, Kyrie eleeiſon, Antiphones, Litanies; bowings to altars, &amp;c. &amp;c. ſo wiſely decreed by ſo many <hi>infallible ſucceſſors</hi> of <hi>PETER</hi>—and all interlarded with pater-noſters, three or four times repeated in every ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and <hi>12</hi> times a day in every cathedral church.
