            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE public are here preſented with the laſt literary attempt of an author, whoſe fame has been uncommonly extenſive, and whoſe talents have probably been moſt admired, by the perſons by whom talents are eſtimated with the greateſt accuracy and diſcrimination. There are few, to whom her writings could in any caſe have given pleaſure, that would have wiſhed that this fragment ſhould have been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, becauſe it is a fragment. There is a ſentiment, very dear to minds of taſte and imagination, that finds a melancholy delight in contemplating theſe unfiniſhed productions of genius, theſe ſketches of what, if they had been filled up in a manner adequate to the writer's conception, would
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:035555_0004_100560AF61FF6A38"/>
perhaps have given a new impulſe to the manners of a world.</p>
            <p>The purpoſe and ſtructure of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing work, had long formed a favourite ſubject of meditation with its author, and ſhe judged them capable of producing an important effect. The compoſition had been in progreſs for a period of twelve months. She was anxious to do juſtice to her conception, and recommenced and reviſed the manuſcript ſeveral different times. So much of it as is here given to the public, ſhe was far from conſidering as finiſhed, and, in a letter to a friend di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly written on this ſubject, ſhe ſays, "I am perfectly aware that ſome of the incidents ought to be tranſpoſed, and heightened by more harmonious ſhading; and I wiſhed in ſome degree to avail my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of criticiſm, before I began to adjuſt my events into a ſtory, the outline of which I had ſketched in my mind."<note n="*" place="bottom">A more copious extract of this letter is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined to the author's preface.</note> The only
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:035555_0005_100560B0E8821630"/>
friends to whom the author communicated her manuſcript, were mr. Dyſon, the tranſlator of the Sorcerer, and the preſent editor; and it was impoſſible for the moſt inexperienced author to diſplay a ſtronger deſire of profiting by the cenſures and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents that might be ſuggeſted.<note n="†" place="bottom">The part communicated conſiſted of the firſt fourteen chapters.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In reviſing theſe ſheets for the preſs, it was neceſſary for the editor, in ſome places, to connect the more finiſhed parts with the pages of an older copy, and a line or two in addition ſometimes appeared requiſite for that purpoſe. Wherever ſuch a liberty has been taken, the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional phraſes will be found incloſed in brackets; it being the editor's moſt earneſt deſire, to intrude nothing of himſelf into the work, but to give to the public the words, as well as ideas, of the real author.</p>
            <p>What follows in the enſuing pages, is not a preface regularly drawn out by the
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:035555_0006_100560B36B89CC38"/>
author, but merely hints for a preface, which, though never filled up in the manner the writer intended, appeared to be worth preſerving.</p>

            <head>AUTHOR'S PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Wrongs of Woman, like the wrongs of the oppreſſed part of mankind, may be deemed neceſſary by their oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors: but ſurely there are a few, who will dare to advance before the improvement of the age, and grant that my ſketches are not the abortion of a diſtempered fancy, or the ſtrong delineations of a wounded heart.</p>
            <p>In writing this novel, I have rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to pourtray paſſions than man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            <p>In many inſtances I could have made the incidents more dramatic, would I have ſacrificed my main object, the deſire of
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:035555_0008_100560B88AA03AE8"/>
exhibiting the miſery and oppreſſion, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to women, that ariſe out of the partial laws and cuſtoms of ſociety.</p>
            <p>In the invention of the ſtory, this view reſtrained my fancy; and the hiſtory ought rather to be conſidered, as of woman, than of an individual.</p>
            <p>The ſentiments I have embodied.</p>
            <p>In many works of this ſpecies, the hero is allowed to be immoral, and to become wiſe and virtuous as well as happy, by a train of events and circumſtances. The heroines, on the contrary, are to be born immaculate; and to act like goddeſſes of wiſdom, juſt come forth highly finiſhed Minervas from the head of Jove.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xi" facs="unknown:035555_0009_100560BA0F16FDC8"/>
[The following is an extract of a letter from the author to a friend, to whom ſhe communicated her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript.]</p>
            <p>FOR my part, I cannot ſuppoſe any ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation more diſtreſſing, than for a woman of ſenſibility, with an improving mind, to be bound to ſuch a man as I have deſcribed for life; obliged to renounce all the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing affections, and to avoid cultivating her taſte, leſt her perception of grace and refinement of ſentiment, ſhould ſharpen to agony the pangs of diſappointment. Love, in which the imagination mingles its bewitching colouring, muſt be foſtered by delicacy. I ſhould deſpiſe, or rather call her an ordinary woman, who could endure ſuch a huſband as I have ſketched.</p>
            <p>Theſe appear to me (matrimonial deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:035555_0010_100560BC5D82AC18"/>
of heart and conduct) to be the peculiar Wrongs of Woman, becauſe they degrade the mind. What are termed great misfortunes, may more forcibly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the mind of common readers; they have more of what may juſtly be termed <hi>ſtage-effect;</hi> but it is the delineation of finer ſenſations, which, in my opinion, conſtitutes the merit of our beſt novels. This is what I have in view; and to ſhew the wrongs of different claſſes of women, equally oppreſſive, though, from the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of education, neceſſarily various.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <p>ABODES of horror have frequently been deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed, and caſtles, filled with ſpectres and chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meras, conjured up by the magic ſpell of genius to harrow the ſoul, and abſorb the wondering mind. But, "formed of ſuch ſtuff as dreams are made of," what were they to the manſion of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, in one corner of which Maria ſat, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to recal her ſcattered thoughts!</p>
               <p>Surpriſe, aſtoniſhment, that bordered on diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, ſeemed to have ſuſpended her faculties, till, waking by degrees to a keen ſenſe of anguiſh, a whirlwind of rage and indignation rouſed her
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:035555_0012_100560C168CB0610"/>
torpid pulſe. One recollection with frightful ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity following another, threatened to fire her brain, and make her a fit companion for the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rific inhabitants, whoſe groans and ſhrieks were no unſubſtantial ſounds of whiſtling winds, or ſtartled birds, modulated by a romantic fancy, which amuſe while they affright; but ſuch tones of miſery as carry a dreadful certainty directly to the heart. What effect muſt they then have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced on one, true to the touch of ſympathy, and tortured by maternal apprehenſion!</p>
               <p>Her infant's image was continually floating on Maria's ſight, and the firſt ſmile of intelligence remembered, as none but a mother, an unhappy mother, can conceive. She heard her ſpeaking half cooing, and felt the little twinkling fingers on her burning boſom—a boſom burſting with the nutriment for which this cheriſhed child might now be pining in vain. From a ſtranger ſhe could indeed receive the maternal aliment; Maria was grieved at the thought—but who could watch her with a mother's tenderneſs, a mother's ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial?</p>
               <p>The retreating ſhadows of former ſorrows ruſhed back in a gloomy train, and ſeemed to be pictured on the walls of her priſon, magnified by
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:035555_0013_100560C2ED2A7060"/>
the ſtate of mind in which they were viewed—Still ſhe mourned for her child, lamented ſhe was a daughter, and anticipated the aggravated ills of life that her ſex rendered almoſt inevitable, even while dreading ſhe was no more. To think that ſhe was blotted out of exiſtence was agony, when the imagination had been long employed to expand her faculties; yet to ſuppoſe her turned adrift on an unknown ſea, was ſcarcely leſs afflicting.</p>
               <p>After being two days the prey of impetuous, varying emotions, Maria began to reflect more calmly on her preſent ſituation, for ſhe had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually been rendered incapable of ſober reflection, by the diſcovery of the act of atrocity of which ſhe was the victim. She could not have imagined, that, in all the fermentation of civilized depravity, a ſimilar plot could have entered a human mind.—She had been ſtunned by an unexpected blow; yet life, however joyleſs, was not to be indolently reſigned, or miſery endured without exertion, and proudly termed patience. She had hitherto me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated only to point the dart of anguiſh, and ſuppreſſed the heart heavings of indignant nature, merely by the force of contempt. Now ſhe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to brace her mind to fortitude, and aſk herſelf what was to be her employment in her dreary cell? Was it not to effect her eſcape, to
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035555_0014_100560C54415D278"/>
fly to the ſuccour of her child, and to baffle the ſelfiſh ſchemes of the tyrant her huſband?</p>
               <p>Theſe thoughts rouſed her ſleeping ſpirit, and the ſelf-poſſeſſion returned, that ſeemed to have abandoned her in the infernal ſolitude into which ſhe had been precipitated. The firſt emotions of overwhelming impatience began to ſubſide, and reſentment gave place to tenderneſs, and more tranquil meditation; though anger once more ſtopt the calm current of reflection, when ſhe attempted to move her manacled arms. But this was an outrage that could only excite momentary feelings of ſcorn, which evaporated in a faint ſmile; for Maria was far from thinking it difficult to endure a perſonal inſult with the moſt magnanimous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference.</p>
               <p>She approached the ſmall grated window of her chamber, and for a conſiderable time only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded the blue expanſe; though it commanded a view of a deſolate garden, and of part of a huge pile of buildings, that, after having been ſuffered, for half a century, to fall to decay, had undergone ſome clumſy repairs, merely to render it habitable. The ivy had been torn off the turrets, and the ſtones not wanted to patch up the breaches of time, and exclude the warring elements, left in
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:035555_0015_100560C884D814F0"/>
heaps in the diſordered court. Maria contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated this ſcene, ſhe knew not how long; or rather gazed on the walls, and pondered on her ſituation. To the maſter of this moſt horrid of priſons, ſhe had, ſoon after her entrance, raved of injuſtice, in accents that would have juſtified his treatment, had not a malignant ſmile, when ſhe appealed to his judgment, with a dreadful conviction ſtifled her remonſtrating complaints. By force, or openly, what could be done? But ſurely ſome expedient might occur to an active mind, without any other employment, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of ſufficient reſolution to put the riſk of life into the balance with the chance of freedom.</p>
               <p>A woman entered in the midſt of theſe reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with a firm, deliberate ſtep, ſtrongly marked features, and large black eyes, which ſhe fixed ſteadily on Maria's, as if ſhe deſigned to intimidate her, ſaying at the ſame time—"You had better ſit down and eat your dinner, than look at the clouds."</p>
               <p>"I have no appetite," replied Maria, who had previouſly determined to ſpeak mildly; "why then ſhould I eat?"</p>
               <p>"But, in ſpite of that, you muſt and ſhall eat
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:035555_0016_100560CA0B83EBF8"/>
ſomething. I have had many ladies under my care, who had reſolved to ſtarve themſelves; but, ſoon or late, they gave up their intents as they recovered their ſenſes."</p>
               <p>"Do you really think me mad?" aſked Maria, meeting the ſearching glance of her eye.</p>
               <p>"Not juſt now. But what does that prove?—only that you muſt be the more carefully watched, for appearing at times ſo reaſonable. You have not touched a morſel ſince you entered the houſe."—Maria ſighed intelligibly.—"Could any thing but madneſs produce ſuch a diſguſt for food?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, grief; you would not aſk the queſtion if you knew what it was." The attendant ſhook her head; and a ghaſtly ſmile of deſperate fortitude ſeemed as a forcible reply, and made Maria pauſe, before ſhe added—"Yet I will take ſome refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: I mean not to die:—No; I will preſerve my ſenſes; and convince even you, ſooner than you are aware of, that my intellects have never been diſturbed, though the exertion of them may have been ſuſpended by ſome infernal drug."</p>
               <p>Doubt gathered ſtill thicker on the brow of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:035555_0017_100560CC5E2C1348"/>
her guard, as ſhe attempted to convict her of miſtake.</p>
               <p>"Have patience!" exclaimed Maria, with a ſolemnity that inſpired awe. "My God! how have I been ſchooled into the practice!" A ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focation of voice betrayed the agonizing emotions ſhe was labouring to keep down; and conquering a qualm of diſguſt, ſhe calmly endeavoured to eat enough to prove her docility, perpetually turning to the ſuſpicious female, whoſe obſervation ſhe courted, while ſhe was making the bed and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſting the room.</p>
               <p>"Come to me often," ſaid Maria, with a tone of perſuaſion, in conſequence of a vague plan that ſhe had haſtily adopted, when, after ſurveying this woman's form and features, ſhe felt convinced that ſhe had an underſtanding above the common ſtandard: "and believe me mad, till you are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to acknowledge the contrary." The woman was no fool, that is, ſhe was ſuperior to her claſs; nor had miſery quite petrified the life's-blood of humanity, to which reflections on our own mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes only give a more orderly courſe. The manner, rather than the expoſtulations, of Maria made a ſlight ſuſpicion dart into her mind with correſponding ſympathy, which various other
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:035555_0018_100560CDE453CA18"/>
avocations, and the habit of baniſhing compunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, prevented her, for the preſent, from exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ining more minutely.</p>
               <p>But when ſhe was told that no perſon, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the phyſician appointed by her family, was to be permitted to ſee the lady at the end of the gallery, ſhe opened her keen eyes ſtill wider and uttered a—"hem!" before ſhe enquired—"Why!" She was briefly told, in reply, that the malady was hereditary, and the fits not occurring but at very long and irregular intervals, ſhe muſt be carefully watched; for the length of theſe lucid periods only rendered her more miſchievous, when any vexation or caprice brought on the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſm of phrenſy.</p>
               <p>Had her maſter truſted her, it is probable that neither pity nor curioſity would have made her ſwerve from the ſtraight line of her intereſt; for ſhe had ſuffered too much in her intercourſe with mankind, not to determine to look for ſupport, rather to humouring their paſſions, than courting their approbation by the integrity of her conduct. A deadly blight had met her at the very threſhold of exiſtence; and the wretchedneſs of her mother ſeemed a heavy weight faſtened on her innocent neck, to drag her down to perdition. She could
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:035555_0019_100560D1457DCAD0"/>
not heroically determine to ſuccour an unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; but, offended at the bare ſuppoſition that ſhe could be deceived with the ſame eaſe as a common ſervant, ſhe no longer curbed her curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity; and, though ſhe never ſeriouſly fathomed her own intentions, ſhe would ſit, every moment ſhe could ſteal from obſervation, liſtening to the tale, which Maria was eager to relate with all the perſuaſive eloquence of grief.</p>
               <p>It is ſo chearing to ſee a human face, even if little of the divinity of virtue beam in it, that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria anxiouſly expected the return of the attendant as of a gleam of light to break the gloom of idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Indulged ſorrow, ſhe perceived, muſt blunt or ſharpen the faculties to the two oppoſite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes; producing ſtupidity, the moping melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly of indolence; or the reſtleſs activity of a diſturbed imagination. She ſunk into one ſtate, after being fatigued by the other; till the want of occupation became even more painful than the actual preſſure or apprehenſion of ſorrow; and the confinement that froze her into a nook of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, with an unvaried proſpect before her, the moſt inſupportable of evils. The lamp of life ſeemed to be ſpending itſelf to chaſe the vapours of a dungeon which no art could diſſipate.—And to what purpoſe did ſhe rally all her energy?—
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:035555_0020_100560D37549EFF0"/>
Was not the world a vaſt priſon, and women born ſlaves?</p>
               <p>Though ſhe failed immediately to rouſe a lively ſenſe of injuſtice in the mind of her guard, becauſe it had been ſophiſticated into miſanthropy, ſhe touched her heart. Jemima (ſhe had only a claim to a Chriſtian name, which had not procured her any Chriſtian privileges) could patiently hear of Maria's confinement on falſe pretences; ſhe had felt the cruſhing hand of power, hardened by the exerciſe of injuſtice, and ceaſed to wonder at the perverſions of the underſtanding, which ſyſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atize oppreſſion; but when told that her child, only four months old, had been torn from her, even while ſhe was diſcharging the tendereſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal office, the woman awoke in a boſom long eſtranged from feminine emotions, and Jemima determined to alleviate all in her power, without hazarding the loſs of her place, the ſufferings of a wretched mother, apparently injured, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly unhappy. A ſenſe of right ſeems to reſult from the ſimpleſt act of reaſon, and to preſide over the faculties of the mind, like the maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe of feeling, to rectify the reſt; but (for the compariſon may be carried ſtill farther) how often is the exquiſite ſenſibility of both weakened or
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:035555_0021_100560D4FA508720"/>
deſtroyed by the vulgar occupations, and ignoble pleaſures of life?</p>
               <p>The preſerving her ſituation was, indeed, an important object to Jemima, who had been hunted from hole to hole, as if ſhe had been a beaſt of prey or infected with a moral plague. The wages ſhe received, the greater part of which ſhe hoarded, as her only chance for independence, were much more conſiderable than ſhe could reckon on obtaining any where elſe, were it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that ſhe, an outcaſt from ſociety, could be permitted to earn a ſubſiſtence in a reputable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. Hearing Maria perpetually complain of liſtleſſneſs, and the not being able to beguile grief by reſuming her cuſtomary purſuits, ſhe was eaſily prevailed on, by compaſſion, and that involuntary reſpect for abilities, which thoſe who poſſeſs them can never eradicate, to bring her ſome books and implements for writing. Maria's converſation had amuſed and intereſted her, and the natural conſequence was a deſire, ſcarcely obſerved by herſelf, of obtaining the eſteem of a perſon ſhe admired. The remembrance of better days was rendered more lively; and the ſentiments then acquired appearing leſs romantic than they had for a long period, a ſpark of hope rouſed her mind to new activity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="unknown:035555_0022_100560D6836C4050"/>
How grateful was her attention to Maria! Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by a dead weight of exiſtence, or preyed on by the gnawing worm of diſcontent, with what eagerneſs did ſhe endeavour to ſhorten the long days, which left no traces behind! She ſeemed to be ſailing on the vaſt ocean of life, without ſeeing any land-mark to indicate the progreſs of time; to find employment was then to find variety, the animating principle of nature.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II.</head>
               <p>EARNESTLY as Maria endeavoured to ſoothe, by reading, the anguiſh of her wounded mind, her thoughts would often wander from the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſhe was led to diſcuſs, and tears of maternal tenderneſs obſcured the reaſoning page. She deſcanted on "the ills which fleſh is heir to," with bitterneſs, when the recollection of her babe was revived by a tale of fictitious woe, that bore any reſemblance to her own; and her imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was continually employed, to conjure up and embody the various phantoms of miſery, which folly and vice had let looſe on the world. The loſs of her babe was the tender ſtring; againſt other cruel remembrances ſhe laboured to ſteel her boſom; and even a ray of hope, in the midſt of her gloomy reveries, would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times gleam on the dark horizon of futurity, while perſuading herſelf that ſhe ought to ceaſe to hope, ſince happineſs was no where to be found.—But of her child, debilitated by the grief with which its mother had been aſſailed before it
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:035555_0024_100560DC9C084118"/>
ſaw the light, ſhe could not think without an impatient ſtruggle.</p>
               <p>"I, alone, by my active tenderneſs, could have ſaved," ſhe would exclaim, "from an early blight, this ſweet bloſſom; and, cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, I ſhould have had ſomething ſtill to love."</p>
               <p>In proportion as other expectations were torn from her, this tender one had been fondly clung to, and knit into her heart.</p>
               <p>The books ſhe had obtained, were ſoon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, by one who had no other reſource to eſcape from ſorrow, and the feveriſh dreams of ideal wretchedneſs or felicity, which equally weaken the intoxicated ſenſibility. Writing was then the only alternative, and ſhe wrote ſome rhapſodies, deſcriptive of the ſtate of her mind; but the events of her paſt life preſſing on her, ſhe reſolved circumſtantially to relate them, with the ſentiments that experience, and more matured reaſon, would naturally ſuggeſt.—They might perhaps inſtruct her daughter, and ſhield her from the miſery, the tyranny, her mother knew not how to avoid.</p>
               <p>This thought gave life to her diction, her ſoul
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:035555_0025_100560DE2165BA78"/>
flowed into it, and ſhe ſoon found the taſk of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting almoſt obliterated impreſſions very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting. She lived again in the revived emotions of youth, and forgot her preſent in the retroſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of ſorrows that had aſſumed an unalterable character.</p>
               <p>Though this employment lightened the weight of time, yet, never loſing ſight of her main ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, Maria did not allow any opportunity to ſlip of winning on the affections of Jemima; for ſhe diſcovered in her a ſtrength of mind, that excited her eſteem, clouded as it was by the miſanthropy of deſpair.</p>
               <p>An inſulated being, from the misfortune of her birth, ſhe deſpiſed and preyed on the ſociety by which ſhe had been oppreſſed, and loved not her fellow-creatures, becauſe ſhe had never been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved. No mother had ever fondled her, no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or brother had protected her from outrage; and the man who had plunged her into infamy, and deſerted her when ſhe ſtood in greateſt need of ſupport, deigned not to ſmooth with kindneſs the road to ruin. Thus degraded, was ſhe let looſe on the world; and virtue, never nouriſhed by affection, aſſumed the ſtern aſpect of ſelfiſh independence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:035555_0026_100560DFE10C4038"/>
This general view of her life, Maria gathered from her exclamations and dry remarks. Jemima indeed diſplayed a ſtrange mixture of intereſt and ſuſpicion; for ſhe would liſten to her diſcourſe with earneſtneſs, and then ſuddenly interrupt the converſation, as if afraid of reſigning, by giving way to her ſympathy, her dear-bought knowledge of the world.</p>
               <p>Maria alluded to the poſſibility of an eſcape, and mentioned a compenſation, or reward; but the ſtyle in which ſhe was repulſed made her cautious, and determine not to renew the ſubject, till ſhe knew more of the character ſhe had to work on. Jemima's countenance and dark hints ſeemed to ſay, "You are an extraordinary woman; but let me conſider, this may be one of your lucid inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals." Nay, the very energy of Maria's character, made her ſuſpect that the extraordinary anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhe perceived might be the effect of madneſs. "Should her huſband then ſubſtantiate his charge, and get poſſeſſion of her eſtate, from whence would come the promiſed annuity, or more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired protection? Beſides, might not a woman, anxious to eſcape, conceal ſome of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which made againſt her? Was truth to be expected from one who had been entrapped, kindnapped, in the moſt fraudulent manner?"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="unknown:035555_0027_100560E20E48E410"/>
In this train Jemima continued to argue, the moment after compaſſion and reſpect ſeemed to make her ſwerve; and ſhe ſtill reſolved not to be wrought on to do more than ſoften the rigour of confinement, till ſhe could advance on ſurer ground.</p>
               <p>Maria was not permitted to walk in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; but ſometimes from her window, ſhe turned her eyes from the gloomy walls, in which ſhe pined life away, on the poor wretches who ſtrayed along the walks, and contemplated the moſt terrific of ruins—that of a human ſoul. What is the view of the fallen column, the mould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering arch, of the moſt exquiſite workmanſhip, when compared with this living memento of the fragility, the inſtability, of reaſon, and the wild luxuriancy of noxious paſſions? Enthuſiaſm turned adrift, like ſome rich ſtream overflowing its banks, ruſhes forward with deſtructive velocity, inſpiring a ſublime concentration of thought. Thus thought Maria—Theſe are the ravages over which humanity muſt ever mournfully ponder, with a degree of anguiſh not excited by crumbling marble, or cankering braſs, unfaithful to the truſt of monumental fame. It is not over the decaying productions of the mind, embodied with the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt art, we grieve moſt bitterly. The view of
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:035555_0028_100560E59723F340"/>
what has been done by man, produces a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, yet aggrandizing, ſenſe of what remains to be atchieved by human intellect; but a mental convulſion, which, like the devaſtation of an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, throws all the elements of thought and imagination into confuſion, makes comtemplation giddy, and we frequently aſk on what ground we ourſelves ſtand.</p>
               <p>Melancholy and imbecility marked the features of the wretches allowed to breathe at large; for the frantic, thoſe who in a ſtrong imagination had loſt a ſenſe of woe, were cloſely confined. The playful tricks and miſchievous devices of their diſturbed fancy, that ſuddenly broke out, could not be guarded againſt, when they were permitted to enjoy any portion of freedom; for, ſo active was their imagination, that every new object which accidentally ſtruck their ſenſes, awoke to phrenzy their reſtleſs paſſions; as Maria learned from the burden of their inceſſant rav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               <p>Sometimes, with a ſtrict injunction of ſilence, Jemima would allow Maria, at the cloſe of even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to ſtray along the narrow avenues that ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the dungeon-like apartments, leaning on her arm. What a change of ſcene! Maria wiſhed
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:035555_0029_100560E71CD7A6D8"/>
to paſs the threſhold of her priſon, yet, when by chance ſhe met the eye of rage glaring on her, yet unfaithful to its office, ſhe ſhrunk back with more horror and affright, than if ſhe had ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled over a mangled corpſe. Her buſy fancy pictured the miſery of a fond heart, watching over a friend thus eſtranged, abſent, though pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent—over a poor wretch loſt to reaſon and the ſocial joys of exiſtence; and loſing all conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of miſery in its exceſs. What a taſk, to watch the light of reaſon quivering in the eye, or with agonizing expectation to catch the beam of recollection; tantalized by hope, only to feel deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair more keenly, at finding a much loved face or voice, ſuddenly remembered, or pathetically im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored, only to be immediately forgotten, or viewed with indifference or abhorrence!</p>
               <p>The heart-rending ſigh of melancholy ſunk into her ſoul; and when ſhe retired to reſt, the petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied figures ſhe had encountered, the only human forms ſhe was doomed to obſerve, haunting her dreams with tales of myſterious wrongs, made her wiſh to ſleep to dream no more.</p>
               <p>Day after day rolled away, and tedious as the preſent moment appeared, they paſſed in ſuch an unvaried tenor, Maria was ſurprized to find that
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:035555_0030_100560E96A7D7100"/>
ſhe had already been ſix weeks buried alive, and yet had ſuch faint hopes of effecting her enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. She was earneſtly, as ſhe had ſought for employment, now angry with herſelf for having been amuſed by writing her narrative; and grieved to think that ſhe had for an inſtant thought of any thing, but contriving to eſcape.</p>
               <p>Jemima had evidently pleaſure in her ſociety: ſtill, though ſhe often left her with a glow of kindneſs, ſhe returned with the ſame chilling air; and when her heart appeared for a moment to open, ſome ſuggeſtion of reaſon forcibly cloſed it, before ſhe could give utterance to the confidence Maria's converſation inſpired.</p>
               <p>Diſcouraged by theſe changes, Maria relapſed into deſpondency, when ſhe was cheered by the alacrity with which Jemima brought her a freſh parcel of books; aſſuring her that ſhe had taken ſome pains to obtain them from one of the keepers who attended a gentleman confined in the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite corner of the gallery.</p>
               <p>Maria took up the books with emotion.—"They come," ſaid ſhe, "perhaps, from a wretch condemned, like me, to reaſon on the nature of madneſs, by having wrecked minds continually
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:035555_0031_100560EC6AD9C1D0"/>
under his eye; and almoſt to wiſh himſelf—as I do—mad, to eſcape from the contemplation of it.' Her heart throbbed with ſympathetic alarm; and ſhe turned over the leaves with awe, as if they had become ſacred from paſſing through the hands of an unfortunate being, oppreſſed by a ſimilar fate.</p>
               <p>Dryden's Fables, Milton's Paradiſe Loſt, with ſeveral modern productions, compoſed the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection. It was a mine of treaſure. Some mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal notes in Dryden's Fables, caught her atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: they were written with force and taſte; and in one of the modern pamphlets, there was a frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment left, containing various obſervations on the preſent ſtate of ſociety and government, with a comparative view of the politics of Europe and America. Theſe remarks were written with a degree of generous warmth, when alluding to the enſlaved ſtate of the labouring majority, perfectly in uniſon with Maria's mode of thinking.</p>
               <p>She read them over and over again; and fancy, treacherous fancy, began to ſketch a character, congenial with her own, from theſe ſhadowy out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines.—"Was he mad?" She re-peruſed the marginal notes, and they ſeemed the production of an animated, but not of a diſturbed imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Confined to this ſpeculation, every time
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:035555_0032_100560EEB2AFC8C8"/>
ſhe read them, ſome freſh refinement of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or acuteneſs of thought impreſſed her, which ſhe was aſtoniſhed at herſelf for not having before obſerved.</p>
               <p>What a creative power has an affectionate heart! There are beings who cannot live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loving, as poets love; and who feel the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tric ſpark of genius, wherever it awakens ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or grace. Maria had often thought, when diſciplining her wayward heart, "that to charm, was to be virtuous." "They who make me wiſh to appear the moſt amiable and good in their eyes, muſt poſſeſs in a degree," ſhe would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim, "the graces and virtues they call into action."</p>
               <p>She took up a book on the powers of the human mind; but her attention ſtrayed from cold argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the nature of what ſhe felt while ſhe was feeling, and ſhe ſnapt the chain of the theory to read Dryden's Guiſcard and Sigiſmunda.</p>
               <p>Maria, in the courſe of the enſuing day, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned ſome of the books, with the hope of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting others—and more marginal notes. Thus ſhut out from human intercourſe, and compelled to view nothing but the priſon of vexed ſpirits, to
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:035555_0033_100560F0382E6A70"/>
meet a wretch in the ſame ſituation, was more ſurely to find a friend, than to imagine a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman one, in a ſtrange land, where the human voice conveys no information to the eager ear.</p>
               <p>"Did you ever ſee the unfortunate being to whom theſe books belong?" aſked Maria, when Jemima brought her ſupper. "Yes. He ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times walks out, between five and ſix, before the family is ſtirring, in the morning, with two keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; but even then his hands are confined."</p>
               <p>"What! is he ſo unruly?" enquired Maria, with an accent of diſappointment.</p>
               <p>"No, not that I perceive," replied Jemima; "but he has an untamed look, a vehemence of eye, that excites apprehenſion. Were his hands free, he looks as if he could ſoon manage both his guards: yet he appears tranquil."</p>
               <p>"If he be ſo ſtrong, he muſt be young," ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Maria.</p>
               <p>"Three or four and thirty, I ſuppoſe; but there is no judging of a perſon in his ſituation."</p>
               <p>"Are you ſure that he is mad?" interrupted
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:035555_0034_100560F1C11ABED0"/>
Maria with eagerneſs. Jemima quitted the room without replying.</p>
               <p>"No, no, he certainly is not!" exclaimed Maria, anſwering herſelf; "the man who could write thoſe obſervations was not diſordered in his intellects."</p>
               <p>She ſat muſing, gazing at the moon, and watching its motion as it ſeemed to glide under the clouds. Then, preparing for bed, ſhe thought, "Of what uſe could I be to him, or he to me, if it be true that he is unjuſtly confined?—Could he aid me to eſcape, who is himſelf more cloſely watched?—Still I ſhould like to ſee him." She went to bed, dreamed of her child, yet awoke exactly at half after five o'clock, and ſtarting up, only wrapped a gown around her, and ran to the window. The morning was chill, it was the latter end of September; yet ſhe did not retire to warm herſelf and think in bed, till the ſound of the ſervants, moving about the houſe, convinced her that the unknown would not walk in the garden that morning. She was aſhamed at feeling diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed; and began to reflect, as an excuſe to herſelf, on the little objects which attract atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when there is nothing to divert the mind; and how difficult it was for women to avoid
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:035555_0035_100560F4B013BD40"/>
growing romantic, who have no active duties or purſuits.</p>
               <p>At breakfaſt, Jemima enquired whether ſhe underſtood French? for, unleſs ſhe did, the ſtranger's ſtock of books was exhauſted. Maria replied in the affirmative; but forbore to aſk any more queſtions reſpecting the perſon to whom they belonged. And Jemima gave her a new ſubject for contemplation, by deſcribing the perſon of a lovely maniac, juſt brought into the adjoining chamber. She was ſinging the pathetic ballad of old Robin Gray, with the moſt heart-melting falls and pauſes. Jemima had half-opened the door, when ſhe diſtinguiſhed her voice, and Maria ſtood cloſe to it, ſcarcely daring to reſpire, leſt a modu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ſhould eſcape her, ſo exquiſitely ſweet, ſo paſſionately wild. She began with ſympathy to pourtray to herſelf another victim, when the lovely warbler flew, as it were, from the ſpray, and a torrent of unconnected exclamations and queſtions burſt from her, interrupted by fits of laughter, ſo horrid, that Maria ſhut the door, and, turning her eyes up to heaven, exclaimed—"Gracious God!"</p>
               <p>Several minutes elapſed before Maria could enquire reſpecting the rumour of the houſe (for
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:035555_0036_100560F6D228C5F0"/>
this poor wretch was obviouſly not confined without a cauſe); and then Jemima could only tell her, that it was ſaid, "ſhe had been married, againſt her inclination, to a rich old man, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely jealous (no wonder, for ſhe was a charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing creature); and that, in conſequence of his treatment, or ſomething which hung on her mind, ſhe had, during her firſt lying-in, loſt her ſenſes."</p>
               <p>What a ſubject of meditation—even to the very very confines of madneſs!</p>
               <p>"Woman, fragile flower! why were you ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to adorn a world expoſed to the inroad of ſuch ſtormy elements?" thought Maria, while the poor maniac's ſtrain was ſtill breathing on her ear, and ſinking into her very ſoul.</p>
               <p>Towards the evening, Jemima brought her Rouſſeau's <hi>Heloiſe;</hi> and ſhe ſat reading with eyes and heart, till the return of her guard to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the light. One inſtance of her kindneſs was, the permitting Maria to have one, till her own hour of retiring to reſt. She had read this work long ſince; but now it ſeemed to open a new world to her—the only one worth inhabiting. Sleep was not to be wooed; yet, far from being fatigued by the reſtleſs rotation of thought, ſhe
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:035555_0037_100560F908E30640"/>
roſe and opened her window, juſt as the thin watery clouds of twilight made the long ſilent ſhadows viſible. The air ſwept acroſs her face with a voluptuous freſhneſs that thrilled to her heart, awakening indefinable emotions; and the ſound of the waving branch, or the twittering of a ſtartled bird, alone broke the ſtillneſs of repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing nature. Abſorbed by the ſublime ſenſibility which renders the conſciouſneſs of exiſtence fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, Maria was happy, till an autumnal ſcent, wafted by the breeze of morn from the fallen leaves of the adjacent wood, made her recollect that the ſeaſon had changed ſince her confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet life afforded no variety to ſolace an afflicted heart. She returned diſpirited to her couch, and thought of her child till the broad glare of day again invited her to the window. She looked not for the unknown, ſtill how great was her vexation at perceiving the back of a man, certainly he, with his two attendants, as he turned into a ſide-path which led to the houſe! A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed recollection of having ſeen ſomebody who reſembled him, immediately occurred to puzzle and torment her with endleſs conjectures. Five minutes ſooner, and ſhe ſhould have ſeen his face; and been out of ſuſpenſe—was ever any thing ſo unlucky! His ſteady, bold ſtep, and the whole air of his perſon, burſting as it were from a cloud,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:035555_0038_100560FA8E6205A8"/>
pleaſed her, and gave an outline to the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſketch the individual form ſhe wiſhed to recognize.</p>
               <p>Feeling the diſappointment more ſeverely than ſhe was willing to believe, ſhe flew to Rouſſeau, as her only refuge from the idea of him, who might prove a friend, could ſhe but find a way to inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt him in her fate; ſtill the perſonification of St. Preux, or of an ideal lover far ſuperior, was after this imperfect model, of which merely a glance had been caught, even to the minutiae of the coat and hat of the ſtranger. But if ſhe lent St. Preux, or the demi-god of her fancy, his form, ſhe richly repaid him by the donation of all St. Preux's ſentiments and feelings, culled to gratify her own, to which he ſeemed to have an undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed right, when ſhe read on the margin of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſioned letter, written in the well known hand—"Rouſſeau alone, the true Prometheus of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, poſſeſſed the fire of genius neceſſary to pourtray the paſſion, the truth of which goes ſo directly to the heart."</p>
               <p>Maria was again true to the hour, yet had finiſhed Rouſſeau, and begun to tranſcribe ſome ſelected paſſages; unable to quit either the author or the window, before ſhe had a glimpſe of the
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:035555_0039_100560FCDBE3D8C8"/>
countenance ſhe daily longed to ſee; and, when ſeen, it conveyed no diſtinct idea to her mind where ſhe had ſeen it before. He muſt have been a tranſient acquaintance; but to diſcover an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance was fortunate, could ſhe contrive to attract his attention, and excite his ſympathy.</p>
               <p>Every glance afforded colouring for the picture ſhe was delineating on her heart; and once, when the window was half open, the ſound of his voice reached her. Conviction flaſhed on her; ſhe had certainly, in a moment of diſtreſs, heard the ſame accents. They were manly, and characteriſtic of a noble mind; nay, even ſweet—or ſweet they ſeemed to her attentive ear.</p>
               <p>She ſtarted back, trembling, alarmed at the emotion a ſtrange coincidence of circumſtances inſpired, and wondering why ſhe thought ſo much of a ſtranger, obliged as ſhe had been by his timely interference (for ſhe recollected, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, all the circumſtances of their former meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing). She found however that ſhe could think of nothing elſe; or, if ſhe thought of her daughter, it was to wiſh that ſhe had a father whom her mother could reſpect and love.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III.</head>
               <p>WHEN peruſing the firſt parcel of books, Maria had, with her pencil, written in one of them a few exclamations, expreſſive of compaſſion and ſympathy, which ſhe ſcarcely remembered, till turning over the leaves of one of the volumes, lately brought to her, a ſlip of paper dropped out, which Jemima haſtily ſnatched up.</p>
               <p>"Let me ſee it," demanded Maria impatiently, "You ſurely are not afraid of truſting me with the effuſions of a madman?" "I muſt conſider," replied Jemima; and withdrew, with the paper in her hand.</p>
               <p>In a life of ſuch ſecluſion, the paſſions gain undue force; Maria therefore felt a great degree of reſentment and vexation, which ſhe had not time to ſubdue, before Jemima, returning, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the paper.</p>

               <p>By the moſt preſſing intreaties, Maria prevailed on Jemima to permit her to write a reply to this note. Another and another ſucceeded, in which explanations were not allowed relative to their preſent ſituation; but Maria, with ſufficient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitneſs, alluded to a former obligation; and they inſenſibly entered on an interchange of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents on the moſt important ſubjects. To write theſe letters was the buſineſs of the day, and to receive them the moment of ſunſhine. By ſome means, Darnford having diſcovered Maria's window, when ſhe next appeared at it, he made her, behind his keepers, a profound bow of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and recognition.</p>
               <p>Two or three weeks glided away in this kind
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:035555_0042_100561051657A290"/>
of intercourſe, during which period Jemima, to whom Maria had given the neceſſary information reſpecting her family, had evidently gained ſome intelligence, which increaſed her deſire of pleaſing her charge, though ſhe could not yet determine to liberate her. Maria took advantage of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable change, without too minutely enquiring into the cauſe; and ſuch was her eagerneſs to hold human converſe, and to ſee her former protector, ſtill a ſtranger to her, that ſhe inceſſantly requeſted her guard to gratify her more than curioſity.</p>
               <p>Writing to Darnford, ſhe was led from the ſad objects before her, and frequently rendered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible to the horrid noiſes around her, which previouſly had continually employed her feveriſh fancy. Thinking it ſelfiſh to dwell on her own ſufferings, when in the midſt of wretches, who had not only loſt all that endears life, but their very ſelves, her imagination was occupied with melancholy earneſtneſs to trace the mazes of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, through which ſo many wretches muſt have paſſed in this gloomy receptacle of disjointed ſouls, to the grand ſource of human corruption. Often at midninght was ſhe waked by the diſmal ſhrieks of demoniac rage, or of excruciating deſpair, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in ſuch wild tones of indeſcribable anguiſh as proved the total abſence of reaſon, and rouſed
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:035555_0043_100561075143CCC0"/>
phantoms of horror in her mind, far more terrific than all that dreaming ſuperſtition ever drew. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, there was frequently ſomething ſometing ſo inconceiveably pictureſque in the varying geſtures of unreſtrained paſſion, ſo irreſiſtibly comic in their ſallies, or ſo heart-piercingly pathetic in the little airs they would ſing, frequently burſting out after an awful ſilence, as to faſcinate the attention, and amuſe the fancy, while torturing the ſoul. It was the uproar of the paſſions which ſhe was compelled to obſerve; and to mark the lucid beam of reaſon, like a light trembling in a ſocket, or like the flaſh which divides the threatening clouds of angry heaven only to diſplay the horrors which darkneſs ſhrouded.</p>
               <p>Jemima would labour to beguile the tedious evenings, by deſcribing the perſons and manners of the unfortunate beings, whoſe figures or voices awoke ſympathetic ſorrow in Maria's boſom; and the ſtories ſhe told were the more intereſting, for perpetually leaving room to conjecture ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing extraordinary. Still Maria, accuſtomed to generalize her obſervations, was led to conclude from all ſhe heard; that it was a vulgar error to ſuppoſe that people of abilities were the moſt apt to loſe the command of reaſon. On the contrary, from moſt of the inſtances ſhe could inveſtigate,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:035555_0044_10056108D62F5628"/>
ſhe thought it reſulted, that the paſſions only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſtrong and diſproportioned, becauſe the judgment was weak and unexerciſed, and that they gained ſtrength by the decay of reaſon, as the ſhadows lengthen during the ſun's decline.</p>
               <p>Maria impatiently wiſhed to ſee her fellow ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer; but Darnford was ſtill more earneſt to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an interview. Accuſtomed to ſubmit to every impulſe of paſſion, and never taught, like woman, to reſtrain the moſt natural, and acquire, inſtead of the bewitching frankneſs of nature, a factitious propriety of behaviour, every deſire became a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent that bore down all oppoſition.</p>
               <p>His travelling trunk, which contained the books lent to Maria, had been ſent to him, and with a part of its contents he bribed his principal keeper; who, after receiving the moſt ſolemn promiſe that he would return to his apartment without attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to explore any part of the houſe, conducted him, in the duſk of the evening, to Maria's room.</p>
               <p>Jemima had apprized her charge of the viſit, and ſhe expected with trembling impatience, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired by a vague hope that he might again prove her deliverer, to ſee a man who had before reſcued her from oppreſſion. He entered with an anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:035555_0045_1005610B16C675A8"/>
of countenance, formed to captivate an enthuſiaſt; and, haſtily turned his eyes from her to the apartment, which he ſurveyed with apparent emotions of compaſſionate indignation. Sympathy illuminated his eye, and, taking her hand, he reſpectfully bowed on it, exclaiming—"This is extraordinary!—again to meet you, and in ſuch circumſtances!" Still, impreſſive as was the coincidence of events which brought them once more together, their full hearts did no over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow.—<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>And though, after this firſt viſit, they were permitted frequently to repeat their interviews, they were for ſome time employed in a reſerved converſation, to which all the world might have liſtened; excepting when diſcuſſing ſome literary

ſubject, flaſhes of ſentiment, inforced by each re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxing feature, ſeemed to remind them that their minds were already acquainted.</p>
               <p>By degrees, Darnford entered into the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of his ſtory. In a few words, he informed her that he had been a thoughtleſs, extravagant young men; yet, as he deſcribed his faults, they appeared to be the generous luxuriancy of a noble mind. Nothing like meanneſs tarniſhed the luſtre of his youth, nor had the worm of ſelfiſhneſs lurked in the unfolding bud, even while he had been the dupe of others. Yet he tardily acquired the experience neceſſary to guard him againſt fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture impoſition.</p>
               <p>"I ſhall weary you," continued he, "by my egotiſm: and did not powerful emotions draw me to you,"—his eyes gliſtened as he ſpoke, and a trembling ſeemed to run through his manly frame,—"I would not waſte theſe precious moments in talking of myſelf.</p>
               <p>"My father and mother were people of faſhion; married by their parents. He was fond of the turf, ſhe of the card-table. I, and two or three other children ſince dead, were kept at home till we became intolerable. My father and mother
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:035555_0047_10056110B2B8E4D0"/>
had a viſible diſlike to each other, continually diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played: the ſervants were of the depraved kind uſually found, in the houſes of people of fortune. My brothers and parents all dying, I was left to the care of guardians, and ſent to Eton. I never knew the ſweets of domeſtic affection, but I felt the want of indulgence and frivolous reſpect at ſchool. I will not diſguſt you with a recital of the vices of my youth, which can ſcarcely be comprehended by female delicacy. I was taught to love by a creature I am aſhamed to mention; and the other women with whom I afterwards became intimate, were of a claſs of which you can have no knowledge. I formed my acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with them at the theatres; and when viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city danced in their eyes, I was not eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted by the vulgarity which flowed from their lips. Having ſpent, a few years after I was of age, [the whole of] a conſiderable patrimony, excepting a few hundreds, I had no reſource but to purchaſe a commiſſion in a new raiſed regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, deſtined to ſubjugate America. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret I felt to renounce a life of pleaſure, was counter-balanced by the curioſity I had to ſee America, or rather to travel; [nor had any of theſe circumſtances occurred to my youth, which might have been calculated] to bind my country to my heart. I ſhall not trouble you with the
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:035555_0048_10056112EDBE7300"/>
details of a military life. My blood was ſtill kept in motion; till, towards the cloſe of the conteſt, I was wounded and taken priſoner.</p>
               <p>"Confined to my bed, or chair, by a lingering cure, my only refuge from the preying activity of my mind, was books, which I read with great avidity, profiting by the converſation of my hoſt, a man of found underſtanding. My political ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents now underwent a total change; and, dazzled by the hoſpitality of the Americans, I determined to take up my abode with freedom. I, therefore, with my uſual impetuoſity, ſold my commiſſion, and travelled into the interior parts of the country, to lay out my money to advantage. Added to this, I did not much like the puritanical manners of the large towns. Inequality of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was there moſt diſguſtingly galling. The only pleaſure wealth afforded, was to make an oſtentatious diſplay of it; for the cultivation of the fine arts, or literature, had not introduced into the firſt circles that poliſh of manners which renders the rich ſo eſſentially ſuperior to the poor in Europe. Added to this, an influx of vices had been let in by the revolution, and the moſt rigid principles of religion ſhaken to the centre, before the underſtanding could be gradually emancipated from the prejudices which led their anceſtors
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:035555_0049_10056114770FB400"/>
undauntedly to ſeek an inhoſpitable clime and unbroken ſoil. The reſolution, that led them in purſuit of independence, to embark on rivers like ſeas, to ſearch for unknown ſhores, and to ſleep under the hovering miſts of endleſs foreſts, whoſe baleful damps agued their limbs, was now turned into commercial ſpeculations, till the national character exhibited a phenomenon in the hiſtory of the human mind—a head enthuſiaſtically en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſing, with cold ſelfiſhneſs of heart. And woman, lovely woman!—they charm every where—ſtill there is a degree of prudery, and a want of taſte and eaſe in the manners of the American women, that renders them, in ſpite of their roſes and lilies, far inferior to our European charmers. In the country, they have often a bewitching ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of character; but, in the cities, they have all the airs and ignorance of the ladies who give the tone to the circles of the large trading towns in England. They are fond of their ornaments, merely becauſe they are good, and not becauſe they embelliſh their perſons; and are more gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified to inſpire the women with jealouſy of theſe exterior advantages, than the men with love. All the frivolity which often (excuſe me, madam) renders the ſociety of modeſt women ſo ſtupid in England, here ſeemed to throw ſtill more leaden fetters on their charms. Not being an adept in
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:035555_0050_100561170A66B070"/>
gallantry, I found that I could only keep myſelf awake in their company by making downright love to them.</p>
               <p>"But, not to intrude on your patience, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to the tract of land which I had purchaſed in the country, and my time paſſed pleaſantly enough while I cut down the trees, built my houſe, and planted my different crops. But winter and idleneſs came, and I longed for more elegant ſociety, to hear what was paſſing in the world, and to do ſomething better than vegetate with the animals that made a very conſiderable part of my houſehold. Conſequently I determined to travel. Motion was a ſubſtitute for a variety of objects; and paſſing over immenſe tracts of country, I exhauſted my exuberant ſpirits, without obtaining much experience. I every where ſaw induſtry the forerunner and not the conſequence, of luxury; but this country, every thing being on an ample ſcale, did not afford thoſe pictureſque views, which a certain degree of cultivation is neceſſary gradually to produce. The eye wandered without an object to fix upon over immeaſurable plains, and lakes that ſeemed repleniſhed by the ocean, whilſt eternal foreſts of ſmall cluſtering trees, obſtructed the circulation of the air, and embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed the path, without gratifying the eye of
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:035555_0051_1005611A40ADF728"/>
taſte. No cottage ſmiling in the waſte, no tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers hailed us, to give life to ſilent nature; or, if perchance we ſaw the print of a footſtep in our path, it was a dreadful warning to turn aſide; and the head ached as if aſſailed by the ſcalping knife. The Indians who hovered on the ſkirts of the European ſettlements had only learned of their neighbours to plunder, and they ſtole guns from them to do it with more ſafety.</p>
               <p>From the woods and back ſettlements, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the towns, and learned to eat and drink moſt valiantly; but without entering into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce (and I deteſted commerce) I found I could not live there; and, growing heartily weary of the land of liberty and vulgar ariſtocracy, ſeated on her bags of dollars, I reſolved once more to viſit Europe. I wrote to a diſtant relation in England, with whom I had been educated, mentioning the veſſel in which I intended to ſail. Arriving in London, my ſenſes were intoxicated. I ran from ſtreet to ſtreet, from theatre to theatre, and the women of the town (again I muſt beg pardon for my habitual frankneſs) appeared to me like angels.</p>
               <p>"A week was ſpent in this thoughtleſs manner, when, returning very late to the hotel in which I lodged ever ſince my arrival, I was knocked down

in a private ſtreet, and hurried, in a ſtate of inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, into a coach, which brought me hither, and I only recovered my ſenſes to be treated like one who had loſt them.

               <p>PITY, and the forlorn ſeriouſneſs of adverſity, have been both conſidered as diſpoſitions favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to love, while ſatirical writers have attributed the propenſity to the relaxing effect of idleneſs; what chance then had Maria of eſcaping, when pity, ſorrow, and ſolitude all conſpired to ſoften her mind, nouriſh romantic wiſhes, and, from a natural progreſs, romantic expectations?</p>
               <p>Maria was ſix-and-twenty. But, ſuch was the native ſoundneſs of her conſtitution, that time had only given to her countenance the character of her mind. Revolving thought, and exerciſed affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had baniſhed ſome of the playful graces of innocence, producing inſenſibly that irregularity of features which the ſtruggles of the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to trace or govern the ſtrong emotions of the heart, are wont to imprint on the yielding maſs. Grief and care had mellowed, without obſcuring, the bright tints of youth, and the thoughtfulneſs which reſided on her brow did not take from the
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:035555_0054_10056120139CD7F0"/>
feminine ſoftneſs of her features; nay, ſuch was the ſenſibility which often mantled over it, that ſhe frequently appeared, like a large proportion of her ſex, only born to feel; and the activity of her well-proportioned, and even almoſt voluptuous figure, inſpired the idea of ſtrength of mind, rather than of body. There was a ſimplicity ſometimes indeed in her manner, which bordered on infantine ingenuouſneſs, that led people of common diſcernment to underrate her talents, and ſmile at the flights of her imagination. But thoſe who could not comprehend the delicacy of her ſentiments, were attached by her unfailing ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy, ſo that ſhe was very generally beloved by characters of very different deſcriptions; ſtill, ſhe was too much under the influence of an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent imagination to adhere to common rules.</p>
               <p>There are miſtakes of conduct which at five-and-twenty prove the ſtrength of the mind, that, ten or fifteen years after, would demonſtrate its weakneſs, its incapacity to acquire a ſane judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The youths who are ſatisfied with the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary pleaſures of life, and do not ſigh after ideal phantoms of love and friendſhip, will never arrive at great maturity of underſtanding; but if theſe reveries are cheriſhed, as is too frequently the caſe with women, when experience ought to have
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:035555_0055_10056122DA7BDC88"/>
taught them in what human happineſs conſiſts, they become as uſeleſs as they are wretched. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, their pains and pleaſures are ſo dependent on outward circumſtances, on the objects of their affections, that they ſeldom act from the impulſe of a nerved mind, able to chooſe its own purſuit.</p>
               <p>Having had to ſtruggle inceſſantly with the vices of mankind, Maria's imagination found re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in pourtraying the poſſible virtues the world might contain. Pygmalion formed an ivory maid, and longed for an informing ſoul. She, on the contrary, combined all the qualities of a hero's mind, and fate preſented a ſtatue in which ſhe might enſhrine them.</p>
               <p>We mean not to trace the progreſs of this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or recount how often Darnford and Maria were obliged to part in the midſt of an intereſting converſation. Jemima ever watched on the tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toe of fear, and frequently ſeparated them on a falſe alarm, when they would have given worlds to remain a little longer together.</p>
               <p>A magic lamp now ſeemed to be ſuſpended in Maria's priſon, and fairy landſcapes flitted round the gloomy walls, late ſo blank. Ruſhing from the depth of deſpair, on the ſeraph wing of hope,
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:035555_0056_10056125235BE910"/>
ſhe found herſelf happy.—She was beloved, and every emotion was rapturous.</p>
               <p>To Darnford ſhe had not ſhown a decided affection; the fear of outrunning his, a ſure proof of love, made her often aſſume a coldneſs and indifference foreign from her character; and, even giving way to the playful emotions of a heart juſt looſened from the frozen bond of grief, there was a delicacy in her manner of expreſſing her ſenſibility, which made him doubt whether it was the effect of love.</p>
               <p>One evening, when Jemima left them, to liſten to the ſound of a diſtant foot-ſtep, which ſeemed cautiouſly to approach, he ſeized Maria's hand—it was not withdrawn. They converſed with ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs of their ſituation; and during the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, he once or twice gently drew her towards him. He felt the fragrance of her breath, and longed, yet feared, to touch the lips from which it iſſued; ſpirits of purity ſeemed to guard them, while all the enchanting graces of love ſported on her cheeks, and languiſhed in her eyes.</p>
               <p>Jemima entering, he reflected on his diffidence with poignant regret, and ſhe once <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> taking alarm, he ventured, as Maria ſtood near his chair,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:035555_0057_10056126A8FE85A8"/>
to approach her lips with a declaration of love. She drew back with ſolemnity, he hung down his head abaſhed; but lifting his eyes timidly, they met her's; ſhe had determined, during that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and ſuffered their rays to mingle. He took, with more ardour reaſſured, a half-conſenting, half-reluctant kiſs, reluctant only from modeſty; and there was a ſacredneſs in her dignified manner of reclining her glowing face on his ſhoulder, that powerfully impreſſed him. Deſire was loſt in more ineffable emotions, and to protect her from inſult and ſorrow—to make her happy, ſeemed not only the firſt wiſh of his heart, but the moſt noble duty of his life. Such angelic confidence demanded the fidelity of honour; but could he, feeling her in every pulſation, could he ever change, could he be a villain? The emotion with which ſhe, for a moment, allowed herſelf to be preſſed to his boſom, the ear <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> rapturous ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy, mingled with a ſoft melancholy ſentiment of recollected diſappointment, ſaid—more of truth and faithfulneſs, than the tongue could have given utterance to in hours! They were ſilent yet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed, how eloquently? till, after a moment's reflection, Maria drew her chair by the ſide of his, and, with a compoſed ſweetneſs of voice, and ſupernatural benignity of countenance, ſaid, "I muſt open my whole heart to you: you muſt be
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:035555_0058_100561292F4906B8"/>
told who I am, why I am here, and why, telling you I am a wife, I bluſh not to"—the bluſh ſpoke the reſt.</p>
               <p>Jemima was again at her elbow, and the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traint of her preſence did not prevent an animated converſation, in which love, ſly urchin, was ever at bo-peep.</p>
               <p>So much of heaven did they enjoy, that para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe bloomed around them; or they, by a powerful ſpell, had been tranſported into Armida's garden. Love, the great enchanter, "lapt them in Ely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſium," and every ſenſe was harmonized to the ſocial extacy. So animated, indeed, were their accents of tenderneſs, in diſcuſſing what, in other circumſtances would have been common-place ſubjects, that Jemima felt, with ſurpriſe, a tear of pleaſure trickling down her rugged cheeks. She wiped it away, half aſhamed; and when Maria kindly enquired the cauſe, with all the eager ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude of a happy being wiſhing to impart to all nature its overflowing felicity, Jemima owned that it was the firſt tear that ſocial enjoyment had ever drawn from her. She ſeemed indeed to breathe more freely; the cloud of ſuſpicion cleared away from her brow; ſhe felt herſelf, for once in her life, treated like a fellow-creature.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="unknown:035555_0059_1005612C26E67730"/>
Imagination! who can paint thy power; or reflect the evaneſcent tints of hope foſtered by thee? A deſpondent gloom had long obſcured Maria's horizon—now the ſun broke forth, the rainbow appeared, and every proſpect was fair. Horror ſtill reigned in the darkened cells, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion lurked in the paſſages, and whiſpered along the walls. The yells of men poſſeſſed, ſometimes made them pauſe, and wonder that they felt ſo happy in a tomb of living death. They even chid themſelves for ſuch apparent inſenſibility; ſtill the world contained not three happier beings. And Jemima, after again patrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the paſſage, was ſo ſoftened by the air of confidence which breathed around her, that ſhe voluntarily began an account of herſelf.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V.</head>
               <p>"MY father," ſaid Jemima, "ſeduced my mother, a pretty girl, with whom he lived fellow-ſervant; and ſhe no ſooner perceived the natural, the dreaded conſequence, than the terrible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction flaſhed on her—that ſhe was ruined. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, and a regard for her reputation, had been the only principles inculcated by her mother; and they had been ſo forcibly impreſſed, that ſhe feared ſhame, more than the poverty to which it would lead. Her inceſſant importunities to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon my father to ſcreen her from reproach by marrying her, as he had promiſed in the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of ſeduction, eſtranged him from her ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely, that her very perſon became diſtaſteful to him; and he began to hate, as well as deſpiſe me, before I was born.</p>
               <p>"My mother, grieved to the ſoul by his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect, and unkind treatment, actually reſolved to famiſh herſelf; and injured her health by the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; though ſhe had not ſufficient reſolution
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:035555_0061_1005612FECF83118"/>
to adhere to her project, or renounce it entirely. Death came not at her call; yet ſorrow, and the methods ſhe adopted to conceal her condition, ſtill doing the work of a houſe-maid, had ſuch an effect on her conſtitution, that ſhe died in the wretched garret, where her virtuous miſtreſs had forced her to take refuge in the very pangs of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, though my father, after a ſlight reproof, was allowed to remain in his place—allowed by the mother of ſix children, who, ſcarcely permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a footſtep to be heard, during her month's indulgence, felt no ſympathy for the poor wretch, denied every comfort required by her ſituation.</p>
               <p>"The day my mother died, the ninth after my birth, I was conſigned to the care of the cheapeſt nurſe my father could find; who ſuckled her own child at the ſame time, and lodged as many more as ſhe could get, in two cellar-like apartments.</p>
               <p>"Poverty, and the habit of ſeeing children die off her hands, had ſo hardened her heart, that the office of a mother did not awaken the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a woman; nor were the feminine careſſes which ſeemed a part of the rearing of a child, ever beſtowed on me. The chicken has a wing to ſhelter under; but I had no boſom to neſtle in, no kindred warmth to foſter me. Left in dirt,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:035555_0062_10056132267F3598"/>
to cry with cold and hunger till I was weary, and ſleep without ever being prepared by exerciſe, or lulled by kindneſs to reſt; could I be expected to become any thing but a weak and rickety babe? Still, in ſpite of neglect, I continued to exiſt, to learn to curſe exiſtence, "her countenance grew ferocious as ſhe ſpoke," and the treatment that rendered me miſerable, ſeemed to ſharpen my wit. Confined then in a damp hovel, to rock the cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the ſucceeding tribe, I looked like a little old woman, or a hag ſhrivelling into nothing. The furrows of reflection and care contracted the youthful cheek, and gave a ſort of ſupernatural wildneſs to the ever watchful eye. During this period, my father had married another fellow-ſervant, who loved him leſs, and knew better how to manage his paſſion, than my mother. She likewiſe proving with child, they agreed to keep a ſhop: my ſtep-mother, if, being an illegitimate offspring, I may venture thus to characterize her, having obtained a ſum of a rich relation, for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>"Soon after her lying-in, ſhe prevailed on my father to take me home, to ſave the expence of maintaining me, and of hiring a girl to aſſiſt her in the care of the child. I was young, it was true, but appeared a knowing little thing, and
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:035555_0063_100561345DF426E0"/>
might be made handy. Accordingly I was brought to her houſe; but not to a home—for a home I never knew. Of this child, a daughter, ſhe was extravagantly fond; and it was a part of my employment, to aſſiſt to ſpoil her, by humour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all her whims, and bearing all her caprices. Feeling her own conſequence, before ſhe could ſpeak, ſhe had learned the art of tormenting me, and if I ever dared to reſiſt, I received blows laid on with no compunctious hand, or was ſent to bed dinnerleſs, as well as ſupperleſs. I ſaid that it was a part of my daily labour to attend this child, with the ſervility of a ſlave; ſtill it was but a part. I was ſent out in all ſeaſons, and from place to place, to carry burdens far above my ſtrength, without being allowed to draw near the fire, or ever being cheered by encouragement or kindneſs. No wonder then, treated like a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of another ſpecies, that I began to envy, and at length to hate, the darling of the houſe. Yet, I perfectly remember, that it was the careſſes, and kind expreſſions of my ſtep-mother, which firſt excited my jealous diſcontent. Once, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forget it, when ſhe was calling in vain her wayward child to kiſs her, I ran to her, ſaying, 'I will kiſs you, ma'am!' and how did my heart, which was in my mouth, ſink, what was my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſement of ſoul, when puſhed away with—'I
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:035555_0064_1005613755A89DE0"/>
do not want you, pert thing!' Another day, when a new gown had excited the higheſt good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and ſhe uttered the appropriate <hi>dear,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed unexpectedly to me, I thought I could never do enough to pleaſe her; I was all alacrity, and roſe proportionably in my own eſtimation,</p>
               <p>"As her daughter grew up, ſhe was pampered with cakes and fruit, while I was, literally ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, fed with the refuſe of the table, with her leavings. A liquoriſh tooth, is, I believe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to children, and I uſed to ſteal any thing ſweet, that I could catch up with a chance of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment. When detected, ſhe was not content to chaſtiſe me herſelf at the moment, but, on my father's return in the evening (he was a ſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man), the principal diſcourſe was to recount my faults, and attribute them to the wicked diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which I had brought into the world with me, inherited from my mother. He did not fail to leave the marks of his reſentment on my body, and then ſolaced himſelf by playing with my ſiſter.—I could have murdered her at thoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. To ſave myſelf from theſe unmerciful corrections, I reſorted to falſhood, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths which I ſturdily maintained, were brought in judgment againſt me, to ſupport my tyrant's inhuman charge of my natural propenſity to vice.
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:035555_0065_10056138DBFB0660"/>
Seeing me treated with contempt, and always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fed and dreſſed better, my ſiſter conceived a contemptuous opinion of me, that proved an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle to all affection; and my father, hearing continually of my faults, began to conſider me as a curſe entailed on him for his ſins: he was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore eaſily prevailed on to bind me apprentice to one of my ſtep-mother's friends, who kept a ſlop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop in Wapping. I was repreſented (as it was ſaid) in my true colours; but ſhe, 'warranted,' ſnapping her fingers, 'that ſhe ſhould break my ſpirit or heart.'</p>
               <p>"My mother replied, with a whine, 'that if any body could make me better, it was ſuch a clever woman as herſelf; though, for her own part, ſhe had tried in vain; but goodnature was her fault.'</p>
               <p>"I ſhudder with horror, when I recollect the treatment I had now to endure. Not only under the laſh of my taſk miſtreſs, but the drudge of the maid, apprentices and children, I never had a taſte of human kindneſs to ſoften the rigour of perpetual labour. I had been introduced as an object of abhorrence into the family; as a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of whom my ſtep-mother, though ſhe had been kind enough to let me live in the houſe with
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:035555_0066_1005613B0737A800"/>
her own child, could make nothing. I was deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed as a wretch, whoſe noſe muſt be kept to the grinding ſtone—and it was held there with an iron graſp. It ſeemed indeed the privilege of their ſuperior nature to kick me about like the dog or cat. If I were attentive, I was called fawning, if refractory, an obſtinate mule, and like a mule I received their cenſure on my loaded back. Often has my miſtreſs, for ſome inſtance of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs, thrown me from one ſide of the kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chen to the other, knocking my head againſt the wall, ſpit in my face, with various refinements on barbarity that I forbear to enumerate, though they were all acted over again by the ſervant, with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional inſults, to which the appellation of <hi>baſtard,</hi> was commonly added, with taunts or ſneers. But I will not attempt to give you an adequate idea of my ſituation, leſt you, who probably have never been drenched with the dregs of human miſery, ſhould think I exaggerate.</p>
               <p>"I ſtole now, from abſolute neceſſity,—bread; yet whatever elſe was taken, which I had it not in my power to take, was aſcribed to me. I was the filching cat, the ravenous dog, the dumb brute, who muſt bear all; for if I endeavoured to exculpate myſelf, I was ſilenced, without any enquiries being made, with 'hold your tongue,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:035555_0067_1005613D1F6932E0"/>
you never tell truth.' Even the very air I breathed was tainted with ſcorn; for I was ſent to the neighbouring ſhops with glutton, liar, or thief, written on my forehead. This was, at firſt, the moſt bitter puniſhment; but ſullen pride, or a kind of ſtupid deſperation, made me, at length, almoſt regardleſs of the contempt, which had wrung from me ſo many ſolitary tears at the only moments when I was allowed to reſt.</p>
               <p>"Thus was I the mark of cruelty till my ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year; and then I have only to point out a change of miſery; for a period I never knew. Allow me firſt to make one obſervation. Now I look back, I cannot help attributing the greater part of my miſery, to the misfortune of having been thrown into the world without the grand ſupport of life—a mother's affection. I had no one to love me; or to make me reſpected to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble me to acquire reſpect. I was an egg dropped on the ſand; a pauper by nature, hunted from family to family, who belonged to nobody—and nobody cared for me. I was deſpiſed from my birth, and denied the chance of obtaining a foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for myſelf in ſociety. Yes; I had not even the chance of being conſidered as a fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture—yet all the people with whom I lived, bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talized as they were by the low cunning of trade,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:035555_0068_1005613FD9B43B10"/>
and the deſpicable ſhifts of poverty, were not without bowels, though they never yearned for me. I was, in fact, born a ſlave, and chained by infamy to ſlavery during the whole of exiſtence, without having any companions to alleviate it by ſympathy, or teach me how to riſe above it by their example. But, to reſume the thread of my tale—</p>
               <p>"At ſixteen, I ſuddenly grew tall, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like comelineſs appeared on a Sunday, when I had time to waſh my face, and put on clean clothes. My maſter had once or twice caught hold of me in the paſſage; but I inſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively avoided his diſguſting careſſes. One day, however, when the family were at a methodiſt meeting, he contrived to be alone in the houſe with me, and by blows—yes, blows and menaces, compelled me to ſubmit to his ferocious deſire; and, to avoid my miſtreſs's fury, I was obliged in future to comply, and to ſkulk to my loft at his command, in ſpite of increaſing loathing.</p>
               <p>"The anguiſh which was now pent up in my boſom, ſeemed to open a new world to me: I began to extend my thoughts beyond myſelf, and grieve for human miſery, till I diſcovered with horror—ah! what horror! that I was with child.
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:035555_0069_100561415E43B9F8"/>
I knew not why I felt a mixed ſenſation of deſpair and tenderneſs, excepting that, ever called a baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard, a baſtard appeared to me an object of the greateſt compaſſion in creation.</p>
               <p>"I communicated this dreadful circumſtance to my maſter, who was almoſt equally alarmed at the intelligence; for he feared his wife, and public cenſure at the meeting. After ſome weeks of deliberation had elapſed, I in continual fear that my altered ſhape would be noticed, my maſter gave me a medicine in a phial, which he deſired me to take, telling me, without any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumlocution, for what purpoſe it was deſigned. I burſt into tears, I thought it was killing myſelf, yet was ſuch a ſelf as I worth preſerving? He curſed me for a fool, and left me to my own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections. I could not reſolve to take this infernal potion; but I wrapt it up in an old gown, and hid it in a corner of my box.</p>
               <p>"Nobody yet ſuſpected me, becauſe they had been accuſtomed to view me as a creature of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſpecies. But the threatening ſtorm at laſt broke over my devoted head—never ſhall I forget it! One Sunday evening, when I was left, as uſual, to take care of the houſe, my maſter came home intoxicated, and I became the prey of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

brutal appetite. His extreme intoxication made him forget his cuſtomary caution, and my miſtreſs entered and found us in a ſituation that could not have been more hateful to her than me. Her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was 'pot valiant,' he feared her not at the moment, nor had he then much reaſon, for ſhe inſtantly turned the whole force of her anger an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other way. She tore off my cap, ſcratched, kicked, and buffetted me, till ſhe had exauſted her ſtrength, declaring, as ſhe reſted her arm, 'that I had wheedled her huſband from her. But could any thing better be expected from a wretch, whom ſhe had taken into her houſe out of pure charity?' What a torrent of abuſe ruſhed out? till, almoſt breathleſs, ſhe concluded with ſaying—' that I was born a ſtrumpet; it ran in my blood, and nothing good could come to thoſe who harboured me.'</p>
               <p>My ſituation was, of courſe, diſcovered, and ſhe declared that I ſhould not ſtay another night under the ſame roof with an honeſt family. I was therefore puſhed out of doors, and my trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery thrown after me, when it had been contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly examined in the paſſage, leſt I ſhould have ſtolen any thing.</p>
               <p>"Behold me then in the ſtreet, utterly deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute!
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:035555_0071_1005614665D44F98"/>
Whither would I creep for ſhelter? To my father's roof I had no claim, when not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued by ſhame;—now I ſhrunk back as from death, from my mother's cruel reproaches, my father's execrations. I could not endure to hear him curſe the day I was born, though life had been a curſe to me. Of death I thought, but with a confuſed emotion of terror, as I ſtood leaning my head on a poſt, and ſtarting at every footſtep, leſt it ſhould be my miſtreſs coming to tear my heart out. One of the boys of the ſhop paſſing by, heard my tale, and immediately repaired to his maſter, to give him a deſcription of my ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and he touched the right key—the ſcandal it would give riſe to, if I were left to repeat my tale to every enquirer. This plea came home to his reaſon, who had been ſobered by his wife's rage, the fury of which fell upon him when I was out of her reach, and he ſent the boy to me with half-a-guinea, deſiring him to conduct me to a houſe, where beggars, and other wretches, the refuſe of ſociety, nightly lodged.</p>
               <p>"This night was ſpent in a ſtate of ſtupefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or deſperation. I deteſted mankind, and abhorred myſelf.</p>
               <p>"In the morning I ventured out, to throw

myſelf in my maſter's way, at his uſual hour of going abroad. I approached him, he 'damned me for a b—, declared I had diſturbed the peace of the family, and that he had ſworn to his wife never to take any more notice of me.' He left me; but inſtantly returning, he told me that he ſhould ſpeak to his friend, a pariſh officer, to get a nurſe for the brat I laid to him; and adviſed me, if I wiſhed to keep out of the houſe of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, not to make free with his name.</p>
               <p>"I hurried back to my hole, and, rage giving place to deſpair, ſought for the potion that was to procure abortion, and ſwallowed it with a wiſh that it might deſtroy me, at the ſame time that it ſtopped the ſenſations of new-born life, which I felt with indeſcribable emotion.—My head turned round, my heart grew ſick, and in the horrors of approaching diſſolution, mental anguiſh was ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up. The effect of the medicine was vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and I was confined to my bed ſeveral days; but youth and a ſtrong conſtitution prevailing, I once more crawled out, to aſk myſelf the cruel queſtion, 'Whither I ſhould go?' I had but two ſhillings left in my pocket, the reſt had been expended, by a poor woman who ſlept in the ſame room, to pay for my lodging, and purchaſe the neceſſaries of which ſhe partook.</p>

I have ſince read in novels of the blandiſhments of ſeduction, but I had not even the pleaſure of being enticed into vice.</p>
               <p>"I ſhall not," interrupted Jemima, "lead your imagination into all the ſcenes of wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and depravity, which I was condemned to view; or mark the different ſtages of my debaſing miſery. Fate dragged me through the very ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels of ſociety; I was ſtill a ſlave, a baſtard, a common property. Become familiar with vice, for I wiſh to conceal nothing from you, I picked the pockets of the drunkards who abuſed me; and proved by my conduct that I deſerved the epithets, with which they loaded me at moments when diſtruſt ought to ceaſe.</p>
               <p>"Deteſting my nightly occupation, though valuing, if I may uſe the word, my independence,

which only conſiſted in chooſing the ſtreet in which I ſhould wander, or the roof, when I had money, in which I ſhould hide my head, I was ſometime before I could prevail on myſelf to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of a place in a houſe of ill fame, to which a girl, with whom I had accidentally converſed in the ſtreet, had recommended me. I had been hunted almoſt into a fever, by the watchmen of the quarter of the town I frequented; one, whom I had unwittingly offended, giving the word to the whole pack. You can ſcarcely conceive the tyranny exerciſed by theſe wretches: conſidering themſelves as the inſtruments of the very laws they violate, the pretext which ſteels their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, hardens their heart. Not content with receiving from us, outlaws of ſociety (let other women talk of favours) a brutal gratification gratuitouſly, as a privilege of office, they extort a tithe of proſtitution, and haraſs with threats the poor creatures whoſe occupations afford not the means to ſilence the growl of avarice. To eſcape from this perſecution, I once more entered into ſervitude.</p>
               <p>"A life of comparative regularity reſtored my health; and—do not ſtart—my manners were improved, in a ſituation where vice ſought to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der itſelf alluring, and taſte was cultivated to

faſhion the perſon, if not to refine the mind. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the common civility of ſpeech, contraſted with the groſs vulgarity to which I had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed, was ſomething like the poliſh of civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lization. I was not ſhut out from all intercourſe of humanity. Still I was galled by the yoke of ſervice, and my miſtreſs often flying into violent fits of paſſion, made me dread a ſudden diſmiſſion, which I underſtood was always the caſe. I was therefore prevailed on, though I felt a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of men, to accept the offer of a gentleman, rather in the decline of years, to keep his houſe, pleaſantly ſituated in a little village near Hampſtead.</p>
               <p>"He was a man of great talents, and of brilliant wit; but a worn-out votary of voluptuouſneſs, his deſires became faſtidious in proportion as they grew weak, and the native tenderneſs of his heart was undermined by a vitiated imagination. A thoughtleſs career of libertiniſm and ſocial en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, had injured his health to ſuch a degree, that, whatever pleaſures his converſation afforded me (and my eſteem was enſured by proofs of the generous humanity of his diſpoſition), the being his miſtreſs was purchaſing it at a very dear rate. With ſuch a keen perception of the delicacies of ſentiment, with an imagination invigorated by the

exerciſe of genius, how could he ſink into the groſſneſs of ſenſuality!</p>
               <p>"But, to paſs over a ſubject which I recollect with pain, I muſt remark to you, as an anſwer to your often repeated queſtion, 'Why my ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and language were ſuperior to my ſtation?' that I now began to read, to beguile the tediouſneſs of ſolitude, and to gratify an inquiſitive, active mind. I had often in my childhood, followed a ballad-ſinger, to hear the ſequel of a diſmal ſtory, though ſure of being ſeverely puniſhed for delaying to return with whatever I was ſent to purchaſe. I could juſt ſpell and put a ſentence together, and I liſtened to the various arguments, though often mingled with obſcenity, which occurred at the table where I was allowed to preſide: for a lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary friend or two frequently came home with my maſter, to dine and paſs the night. Having loſt the privileged reſpect of my ſex, my preſence, inſtead of reſtraining, perhaps gave the reins to their tongues; ſtill I had the advantage of hearing diſcuſſions, from which, in the common courſe of life, women are excluded.</p>
               <p>"You may eaſily imagine, that it was only by degrees that I could comprehend ſome of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects they inveſtigated, or acquire from their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning

what might be termed a moral ſenſe. But my fondneſs of reading increaſing, and my maſter occaſionally ſhutting himſelf up in this retreat, for weeks together, to write, I had many oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of improvement. At firſt, conſidering money" ('I was right!' exclaimed Jemima, alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her tone of voice) "as the only means, after my loſs of reputation, of obtaining reſpect, or even the toleration of humanity, I had not the leaſt ſcruple to ſecrete a part of the ſums intruſted to me, and to ſcreen myſelf from detection by a ſyſtem of falſhood.—But, acquiring new princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, I began to have the ambition of returning to the reſpectable part of ſociety, and was weak enough to ſuppoſe it poſſible. The attention of my unaſſuming inſtructor, who, without being ignorant of his own powers, poſſeſſed great ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of manners, ſtrengthened the illuſion.

The aim of his writings was to touch the ſimple ſtrings of the heart; for he deſpiſed the would-be oracles, the ſelf-elected philoſophers, who fright away fancy, while ſifting each grain of thought to prove that ſlowneſs of comprehenſion is wiſdom.</p>

"I ſhould have diſtinguiſhed this as a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſunſhine, a happy period in my life, had not the repugnance the diſguſting libertiniſm of my protector inſpired, daily become more pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. And, indeed, I ſoon did recollect it as ſuch with agony, when his ſudden death (for he had recourſe to the moſt exhilirating cordials to keep up the convivial tone of his ſpirits) again threw me into the deſert of human ſociety. Had he had any time for reflection, I am certain he would have left the little property in his power to me: but, attacked by the fatal apoplexy in town, his heir, a man of rigid morals, brought his wife with him to take poſſeſſion of the houſe and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, before I was even informed of his death,—'to prevent,' as ſhe took care indirectly to tell me, 'ſuch a creature as ſhe ſuppoſed me to be, from purloining any of them, had I been apprized of the event in time.'</p>

With ſome difficulty I obtained my arrears of wages; but aſking—ſuch is the ſpirit-grinding conſequence of poverty and infamy—for a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter for honeſty and economy, which God knows I merited, I was told by this—why muſt I call her woman?—'that it would go againſt her conſcience to recommend a kept miſtreſs.' Tears ſtarted in my eyes, burning tears; for there are ſituations in which a wretch is humbled by the contempt they are conſcious they do not deſerve.</p>
               <p>"I returned to the metropolis; but the ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of a poor lodging was inconceivably dreary, after the ſociety I had enjoyed. To be cut off from human converſe, now I had been taught to reliſh it, was to wander a ghoſt among the living. Beſides, I foreſaw, to aggravate the ſeverity of my fate, that my little pittance would ſoon melt away. I endeavoured to obtain needle-work; but not having been taught early, and my hands being rendered clumſy by hard work, I did not ſufficiently excel to be employed by the ready<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made linen ſhops, when ſo many women, better qualified, were ſuing for it. The want of a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter prevented me getting a place; for, irkſome as ſervitude would have been to me, I ſhould have made another trial, had it been feaſible.
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:035555_0080_1005615AC4CBE3D8"/>
Not that I diſliked employment, but the inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of condition to which I muſt have ſubmitted. I had acquired a taſte for literature, during the five years I had lived with a literary man, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally converſing with men of the firſt abilities of the age; and now to deſcend to the loweſt vulgarity, was a degree of wretchedneſs not to be imagined unfelt. I had not, it is true, taſted the charms of affection, but I had been familiar with the graces of humanity.</p>
               <p>"One of the gentlemen, whom I had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently dined in company with, while I was treated like a companion, met me in the ſtreet, and enquired after my health. I ſeized the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and began to deſcribe my ſituation; but he was in haſte to join, at dinner, a ſelect party of choice ſpirits; therefore without waiting to hear me, he impatiently put a guinea into my hand, ſaying, it was a pity ſuch a ſenſible wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhould be in diſtreſs—he wiſhed me well from his ſoul.'</p>
               <p>"To another I wrote, ſtating my caſe, and requeſting advice. He was an advocate for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equivocal ſincerity; and had often, in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, deſcanted on the evils which ariſe in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, from the deſpotiſm of rank and riches.</p>

"In reply, I received a long eſſay on the energy of the human mind, with continual allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to his own force of character. He added, 'That the woman who could write ſuch a letter as I had ſent him, could never be in want of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources, were ſhe to look into herſelf, and exert her powers; miſery was the conſequence of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence, and as to my being ſhut out from ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, it was the lot of man to ſubmit to certain privations.'</p>
               <p>"How often have I heard," ſaid Jemima, interrupting her narrative, "in converſation, and read in books, that every perſon willing to work may find employment? It is the vague aſſertion, I believe, of inſenſible indolence, when it relates to men; but, when with reſpect to women, I am ſure of its fallacy, unleſs they will ſubmit to the moſt menial bodily labour; and even to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed at hard labour is out of the reach of many, whoſe reputation misfortune or folly has tainted.</p>
               <p>"How writers, profeſſing to be friends to freedom, and the improvement of morals, can aſſert that poverty is no evil, I cannot imagine."</p>
               <p>"No more can I," interrupted Maria; "yet they even expatiate on the peculiar happineſs of

indigence, though in what it can conſiſt, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in brutal reſt, when a man can barely earn a ſubſiſtence, I cannot imagine. The mind is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily impriſoned in its own little tenement; and, fully occupied by keeping it in repair, has not time to rove abroad for improvement. The book of knowledge is cloſely claſped, againſt thoſe who muſt fulfil their daily taſk of ſevere manual labour or die; and curioſity, rarely excited by thought or information, ſeldom moves on the ſtagnate lake of ignorance."</p>
               <p>"As far as I have been able to obſerve," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Jemima, "prejudices caught up by chance, are obſtinately maintained by the poor, to the excluſion of improvement; they have not time to reaſon or reflect to any extent, or minds ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently exerciſed to adopt the principles of action, which form perhaps the only baſis of contentment in every ſtation."<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>"And independence," ſaid Darnford, "they are neceſſarily ſtrangers to, even the independence
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:035555_0083_100561610EEF16F0"/>
of deſpiſing their perſecutors. If the poor are happy, or can be happy, things are very well as they are. And I cannot conceive on what prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple thoſe writers contend for a change of ſyſtem, who ſupport this opinion.—The authors on the other ſide of the queſtion are much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent, who grant the fact; yet, inſiſting that it is the lot of the majority to be oppreſſed in this life, kindly turn them over to another, to rectify the falſe weights and meaſures of this, as the only way to juſtify the diſpenſations of Providence. "I have not," continued Darnford, "an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion more fixed by obſervation in my mind, than that, though riches may fail to promote propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate happineſs, poverty moſt commonly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes it, by ſhutting up all the avenues to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement."</p>
               <p>"And as for the affections," added Maria, with a ſigh, "how groſs, and even tormenting do they become, unleſs regulated by an improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mind! The culture of the heart, ever, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, keeps pace with that of the mind.—But pray go on," addreſſing Jemima, "though your narrative gives riſe to the moſt painful reflections on the preſent ſtate of ſociety."</p>
               <p>"Not to trouble you," continued ſhe, "with
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:035555_0084_1005616407D77DF8"/>
a detailed deſcription of all the painful feelings of unavailing exertion, I have only to tell you, that at laſt I got recommended to waſh in a few fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, who did me the favour to admit me into their houſes, without the moſt ſtrict enquiry, to waſh from one in the morning till eight at right, for eighteen or twenty-pence a day. On the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to be enjoyed over a waſhing-tub I need not comment; yet you will allow me to obſerve, that this was a wretchedneſs of ſituation peculiar to my ſex. A man with half my induſtry, and, I may ſay, abilities, could have procured a decent livelihood, and diſcharged ſome of the duties which knit mankind together; whilſt I, who had acquired a taſte for the rational, nay, in honeſt pride let me aſſert it, the virtuous enjoyments of life, was caſt aſide as the filth of ſociety. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to labour, like a machine, only to earn bread, and ſcarcely that, I became melancholy and deſperate.</p>
               <p>"I have now to mention a circumſtance which fills me with remorſe, and fear it will entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive me of your eſteem. A tradeſman became attached to me, and viſited me frequently,—and I at laſt obtained ſuch a power over him, that he offered to take me home to his houſe. Conſider, dear madam, I was famiſhing: wonder not that
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:035555_0085_100561658D405198"/>
I became a wolf!—The only reaſon for not taking me home immediately, was the having a girl in the houſe, with child by him—and this girl—I adviſed him—yes, I did! would I could forget it!—to turn out of doors: and one night he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to follow my advice.—Poor wretch! ſhe fell upon her knees, reminded him that he had promiſed to marry her, that her parents were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt!—What did it avail?—She was turned out.</p>
               <p>"She approached her father's door, in the ſkirts of London,—liſtened at the ſhutters—but could not knock. A watchman had obſerved her go and return ſeveral times—Poor wretch!"—The remorſe Jemima ſpoke of ſeemed to be ſtinging her to the ſoul, as ſhe proceeded.</p>
               <p>"She left it, and approaching a tub where horſes were watered, ſhe ſat down in it, and, with deſperate reſolution, remained in that atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude—till reſolution was no longer neceſſary.</p>
               <p>"I happened that morning to be going out to waſh, anticipating the moment when I ſhould eſcape from ſuch hard labour. I paſſed by, juſt as ſome men, who were going to work, drew out the ſtiff, cold corpſe.—Let me not recal the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid moment!—I recogniſed her pale viſage; I
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:035555_0086_10056167ABECB488"/>
liſtened to the tale told by the ſpectators, and my heart did not burſt. I thought of my own ſtate, and wondered how I could be ſuch a monſter!—I worked hard; and returning home, I was attacked by a fever. I ſuffered both in body and mind. I determined not to live with the wretch. But he did not try me; he left the neighbourhood. I once more returned to the waſh-tub.</p>
               <p>"Still this fate, miſerable as it was, admitted of aggravation. Lifting one day a heavy load, a tub fell againſt my ſhin, and gave me great pain. I did not pay much attention to the hurt, till it became a ſerious wound; being obliged to work as uſual or ſtarve. But, finding myſelf at length unable to ſtand for any time, I thought of getting into an hoſpital.—Hoſpitals, it ſhould ſeem (for they are comfortleſs abodes for the ſick) were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly endowed for the reception of the friendleſs; yet I, who had on that plea a right to aſſiſtance, wanted the recommendation of the rich and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectable, and was ſeveral weeks languiſhing for admittance; fees were demanded on entering; and, what was ſtill more unreaſonable, ſecurity for burying me, that expenſe not coming into the letter of the charity. A guinea was the ſtipulated ſum—I could as ſoon have raiſed a million: and I
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:035555_0087_1005564D5CF14570"/>
was afraid to apply to the pariſh for an order, leſt they ſhould have paſſed me, I knew not whither. The poor woman at whoſe houſe I lodged, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionating my ſtate, got me into the hoſpital; and the family where I received the hurt, ſent me five ſhillings, three and ſix-pence of which I gave at my admittance—I know not for what.</p>
               <p>"My leg grew quickly better; but I was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed before my cure was completed, becauſe I could not afford to have my linen waſhed to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear decently, as the virago of a nurſe ſaid, when the gentlemen (the ſurgeons) came. I cannot give you an adequate idea of the wretchedneſs of an hoſpital; every thing is left to the care of people intent on gain. The attendants ſeemed to have loſt all feeling of compaſſion in the buſtling diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their offices; death is ſo familiar to them, that they are not anxious to ward it off. Every thing appeared to be conducted for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation of the medical men and their pupils, who came to make experiments on the poor, for the benefit of the rich. One of the phyſicians, I muſt not forget to mention, gave me half-a-crown, and ordered me ſome wine, when I was at the loweſt ebb. I thought of making my caſe known to the lady-like matron; but her forbidding coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance prevented me. She condeſcended to look
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:035555_0088_1005623DCD626C10"/>
on the patients, and make general enquiries, two or three times a week; but the nurſes knew the hour when the viſit of ceremony would commence, and every thing was as it ſhould be.</p>
               <p>"After my diſmiſſion, I was more at a loſs than ever for a ſubſiſtence, and not to weary you with a repetition of the ſame unavailing attempts, unable to ſtand at the waſhing-tub, I began to conſider the rich and the poor as natural enemies, and became a thief from principle.—I could not now ceaſe to reaſon, but I hated mankind. I deſpiſed myſelf, yet I juſtified my conduct. I was taken, tried, and condemned to ſix months' im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment in a houſe of correction. My ſoul recoils with horror from the remembrance of the inſults I had to endure, till branded with ſhame, I was turned looſe in the ſtreet, pennyleſs. I wandered from ſtreet to ſtreet, till, exhauſted by hunger and fatigue, I ſunk down ſenſeleſs at a door, where I had vainly demanded a morſel of bread. I was ſent by the inhabitant to the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, to which he had ſurlily bid me go, ſaying, 'he paid enough in conſcience to the poor,' when, with parched tongue, I implored his charity. If thoſe well-meaning people, who exclaim againſt beggars, were acquainted with the treatment the poor receive in many of theſe wretched aſylums,
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:035555_0089_100556588DCF1090"/>
they would not ſtifle ſo eaſily involuntary ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, by ſaying that they have all pariſhes to go to, or wonder that the poor dread to enter the gloomy walls. What are the common run of work-houſes, but priſons, in which many reſpectable old peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, worn out by immoderate labour, ſink into the grave in ſorrow, to which they are carried like dogs!"</p>
               <p>Alarmed by ſome indiſtinct noiſe, Jemima roſe haſtily to liſten, and Maria, turning to Darn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, ſaid, "I have indeed been ſhocked beyond expreſſion when I have met a pauper's funeral. A coffin carried on the ſhoulders of three or four ill-looking wretches, whom the imagination might eaſily convert into a band of aſſaſſins haſtening to conceal the corpſe, and quarreling about the prey on their way. I know it is of little conſequence how we are conſigned to the earth; but I am led by this brutal inſenſibility, to what even the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal creation appears forcibly to feel, to advert to the wretched, deſerted manner in which they died."</p>
               <p>"True," rejoined Darnford, "and, till the rich will give more than a part of their wealth, till they will give time and attention to the wants of the diſtreſſed, never let them boaſt of charity.
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:035555_0090_1005565E50C6E048"/>
Let them open their hearts and not their purſes, and employ their minds in the ſervice, if they are really actuated by humanity; or charitable inſtitutions will always be the prey of the loweſt order of knaves."</p>
               <p>Jemima returning, ſeemed in haſte to finiſh her tale. "The overſeer farmed the poor of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent pariſhes, and out of the bowels of poverty was wrung the money with which he purchaſed this dwelling, as a private receptacle for madneſs. He had been a keeper at a houſe of the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, and conceived that he could make mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney much more readily in his old occupation. He is a ſhrewd—ſhall I ſay it?—villain. He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſomething reſolute in my manner, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to take me with him, and inſtruct me how to treat the diſturbed minds he meant to intruſt to my care. The offer of forty pounds a year, and to quit a work-houſe, was not to be deſpiſed, though the condition of ſhutting my eyes and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening my heart was annexed to it.</p>
               <p>"I agreed to accompany him; and, four years have I been attendant on many wretches, and"—ſhe lowered her voice,—"the witneſs of many enormities. In ſolitude my mind ſeemed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover its force, and many of the ſentiments which

I imbibed in the only tolerable period of my life, returned with their full force. Still what ſhould induce me to be the champion for ſuffering hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity?—Who ever riſked any thing for me?—Who ever acknowledged me to be a fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?"—</p>
               <p>Maria took her hand, and Jemima, more over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by kindneſs than ſhe had ever been by cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, haſtened out of the room to conceal her emotions.</p>
               <p>Darnford ſoon after heard his ſummons, and, taking leave of him, Maria promiſed to gratify his curioſity, with reſpect to herſelf, the firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity.</p>

               <p>ACTIVE as love was in the heart of Maria, the ſtory ſhe had juſt heard made her thoughts take a wider range. The opening buds of hope cloſed, as if they had put forth too early, and the happieſt day of her life was overcaſt by the moſt melancholy reflections. Thinking of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mima's peculiar fate and her own, ſhe was led to conſider the oppreſſed ſtate of women, and to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that ſhe had given birth to a daughter. Sleep fled from her eye-lids, while ſhe dwelt on the wretchedneſs of unprotected infancy, till ſympathy with Jemima changed to agony, when it ſeemed probable that her own babe might even now be in the very ſtate ſhe ſo forcibly deſcribed.</p>
               <p>Maria thought, and thought again. Jemima's humanity had rather been benumbed than killed, by the keen froſt ſhe had to brave at her entrance into life; an appeal then to her feelings, on this tender point, ſurely would not be fruitleſs; and Maria began to anticipate the delight it would
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:035555_0093_100561710EE2AF28"/>
afford her to gain intelligence of her child. This project was now the only ſubject of reflection; and ſhe watched impatiently for the dawn of day, with that determinate purpoſe which generally inſures ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>At the uſual hour, Jemima brought her break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, and a tender note from Darnford.—She ran her eye haſtily over it, and her heart calmly hoarded up the rapture a freſh aſſurance of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, affection ſuch as ſhe wiſhed to inſpire her, gave her, without diverting her mind a moment from its deſign. While Jemima waited to take away the breakfaſt, Maria alluded to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, that had haunted her during the night, to the excluſion of ſleep. She ſpoke with energy of Jemima's unremitted ſufferings, and of the fate of a number of deſerted females, placed within the ſweep of a whirlwind, from which it was next to impoſſible to eſcape. Perceiving the effect her converſation produced on the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of her guard, ſhe graſped the arm of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mima with that irreſiſtible warmth which defies repulſe, exclaiming—"With your heart, and ſuch dreadful experience, can you lend your aid to deprive my babe of a mother's tenderneſs, a mother's care? In the name of God, aſſiſt me to ſnatch her from deſtruction! let me but prepare
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:035555_0094_10056172B3A48CF0"/>
her mind and body to encounter the ills which await her ſex, and I will conſider you as her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond mother, and herſelf as the prop of your age. Yes, Jemima, look at me obſerve me cloſely, and read my very ſoul; you merit a better fate." ſhe held out her hand with a firm geſture of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance; "and I will procure it for you as a teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of my eſteem, as well as of my gratitude."</p>
               <p>Jemima had not power to reſiſt this perſuaſive torrent; and, owning that the houſe in which ſhe was confined, was ſituated on the banks of the Thames, only a few miles from London, and not on the ſea-coaſt, as Darnford had ſuppoſed, ſhe promiſed to invent ſome excuſe for her ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and go herſelf to trace the ſituation, and enquire concerning the health, of this abandoned daughter. Her manner implied an intention to do ſomething more, but ſhe ſeemed unwilling to impart her deſign; and Maria, glad to have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the main point, thought it beſt to leave her to the workings of her own mind, convinced that ſhe had the power of intereſting her ſtill more in favour of herſelf and child, by a ſimple recital of facts.</p>
               <p>In the evening, Jemima informed the impatient mother, that on the morrow ſhe ſhould haſten to
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:035555_0095_100561758C0DFFA0"/>
town before the family hour of riſing, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived all the information neceſſary, as a clue to her ſearch. The "Good night!" Maria uttered was peculiarly ſolemn and affectionate. Glad expectation ſparkled in her eye; and, for the firſt time ſince her detention, ſhe pronounced the name of her child with pleaſurable fondneſs; and, with all the garrulity of a nurſe, deſcribed her firſt ſmile when ſhe recognized her mother. Recollecting herſelf, a ſtill kinder "Adieu!" with a "God bleſs you!"—that ſeemed to include a maternal benediction, diſmiſſed Jemima.</p>
               <p>The dreary ſolitude of the enſuing day, length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by impatiently dwelling on the ſame idea, was intolerably weariſome. She liſtened for the ſound of a particular clock, which ſome directions of the wind allowed her to hear diſtinctly. She marked the ſhadow gaining on the wall; and, twilight thickening into darkneſs, her breath ſeemed oppreſſed, while ſhe anxiouſly counted nine.—The laſt ſound was a ſtroke of deſpair on her heart; for ſhe expected every moment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeing Jemima, to have her light extinguiſhed by the ſavage female who ſupplied her place. She was even obliged to prepare for bed, reſtleſs as ſhe was, not to diſoblige her new attendant. She had been cautioned not to ſpeak too freely to her
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:035555_0096_1005617712121940"/>
but the caution was needleſs, her countenance would ſtill more emphatically have made her ſhrink back. Such was the ferocity of manner, conſpicuous in every word and geſture of this hag, that Maria was afraid to enquire, why Jemima, who had faithfully promiſed to ſee her before her door was ſhut for the night, came not?—and, when the key turned in the lock, to conſign her to a night of ſuſpenſe, ſhe felt a degree of anguiſh which the circumſtances ſcarcely juſtified.</p>
               <p>Continually on the watch, the ſhutting of a door, or the ſound of a footſtep, made her ſtart and tremble with apprehenſion, ſomething like what ſhe felt, when, at her entrance, dragged along the gallery, ſhe began to doubt whether ſhe were not ſurrounded by demons?</p>
               <p>Fatigued by an endleſs rotation of thought and wild alarms, ſhe looked like a ſpectre, when Jemima entered in the morning; eſpecially as her eyes darted out of her head, to read in Jemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma's countenance, almoſt as pallid, the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence ſhe dared not truſt her tongue to demand. Jemima put down the tea things, and appeared very buſy in arranging the table. Maria took a cup with trembling hand, then forcibly <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> her fortitude, and reſtraining the convulſive move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:035555_0097_1005617A0ED7CE00"/>
which agitated the muſcles of her mouth, ſhe ſaid, "Spare yourſelf the pain of preparing me for your information, I conjure you!—My child is dead!" Jemima ſolemnly anſwered, "Yes;" with a look expreſſive of compaſſion and angry emotions. "Leave me," added Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, making a freſh effort to govern her feelings, and hiding her face in her handkerchief, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal her anguiſh—"It is enough—I know that my babe is no more—I will hear the particulars when I am"—calmer, ſhe could not utter; and Jemima, without importuning her by idle at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to conſole her, left the room.</p>
               <p>Plunged in the deepeſt melancholy, ſhe would not admit Darnford's viſits; and ſuch is the force of early aſſociations, even on ſtrong minds, that, for a while, ſhe indulged the ſuperſtitious notion that ſhe was juſtly puniſhed by the death of her child for having an inſtant ceaſed to regret her loſs. Two or three letters from Darnford, full of ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, manly tenderneſs, only added poignancy to theſe accuſing emotions; yet the paſſionate ſtile in which he expreſſed, what he termed the firſt and fondeſt wiſh of his heart, "that his affection might make her ſome amends for the cruelty and injuſtice ſhe had endured," inſpired a ſentiment of gratitude to heaven; and her eyes filled with
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:035555_0098_1005617C39B80428"/>
delicious tears, when, at the concluſion of his letter, wiſhing to ſupply the place of her unworthy relations, whoſe want of principle he execrated, he aſſured her, calling her his deareſt girl, "that it ſhould henceforth be the buſineſs of his life to make her happy."</p>
               <p>He begged, in a note ſent the following morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to be permitted to ſee her, when his preſence would be no intruſion on her grief; and ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly intreated to be allowed, according to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, to beguile the tedious moments of abſence, by dwelling on the events of her paſt life, that ſhe ſent him the memoirs which had been written for her daughter, promiſing Jemima the peruſal as ſoon as he returned them.</p>

               <p>"ADDRESSING theſe memoirs to you, my child, uncertain whether I ſhall ever have an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of inſtructing you, many obſervations will probably flow from my heart, which only a mother—a mother ſchooled in miſery, could make.</p>
               <p>"The tenderneſs of a father who knew the world, might be great; but could it equal that of a mother—of a mother, labouring under a portion of the miſery, which the conſtitution of ſociety ſeems to have entailed on all her kind? It is, my child, my deareſt daughter, only ſuch a mother, who will dare to break through all reſtraint to provide for your happineſs—who will voluntarily brave cenſure herſelf, to ward off ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row from your boſom. From my narrative, my dear girl, you may gather the inſtruction, the counſel, which is meant rather to exerciſe than influence your mind. Death may ſnatch me from you, before you can weigh my advice, or enter into my reaſoning: I would then, with fond

anxiety, lead you very early in life to form your grand principle of action, to ſave you from the vain regret of having, through irreſolution, let the ſpring-tide of exiſtence paſs away, unimproved, unenjoyed. Gain experience—ah! gain it—while experience is worth having, and acquire ſufficient fortitude to purſue your own happineſs; it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes your utility, by a direct path. What is wiſdom, too often, but the owl of the goddeſs, who ſits moping in a deſolated heart; around me ſhe ſhrieks, but I would invite all the gay warblers of ſpring to neſtle in your blooming boſom.—Had I not waſted years in deliberating, after I ceaſed to doubt, how I ought to have acted—I might now be uſeful and happy. For my ſake, warned by my example, always appear what you are, and you will not paſs through exiſtence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out enjoying its genuine bleſſings, love and reſpect.</p>
               <p>"Born in one of the moſt romantic parts of England, an enthuſiaſtic fondneſs for the varying charms of nature is the firſt ſentiment I recollect; or rather it was the firſt conſciouſneſs of pleaſure that employed and formed my imagination.</p>
               <p>"My father had been a captain of a man-of-war; but, diſguſted with the ſervice, on account of the preferment of men whoſe chief merit was
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:035555_0101_1005618308636278"/>
their family connections or borough intereſt, he retired into the country; and, not knowing what to do with himſelf—married. In his family, to regain his loſt conſequence, he determined to keep up the ſame paſſive obedience, as in the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels in which he had commanded. His orders were not to be diſputed; and the whole houſe was expected to fly, at the word of command, as if to man the ſhrouds, or mount aloft in an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental ſtrife, big with life or death.—He was to be inſtantaneouſly obeyed, eſpecially by my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom he very benevolently married for love; but took care to remind her of the obligation, when ſhe dared, in the ſlighteſt inſtance, to queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion his abſolute authority. My eldeſt brother, it is true, as he grew up, was treated with more reſpect by my father; and became in due form the deputy-tyrant of the houſe. The repreſentative of my father, a being privileged by nature—a boy, and the darling of my mother, he did not fail to act like an heir apparent. Such indeed was my mother's extravagant partiality, that, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon with her affection for him, ſhe might be ſaid not to love the reſt of her children.—Yet none of the children ſeemed to have ſo little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for her. Extreme indulgence had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him ſo ſelfiſh, that he only thought of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and from tormenting inſects and animals,
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:035555_0102_10056185249BF6A8"/>
he became the deſpot of his brothers, and ſtill more of his ſiſters.</p>
               <p>"It is perhaps difficult to give you an idea of the petty cares which obſcured the morning of my life; continual reſtraint in the moſt trivial matters; unconditional ſubmiſſion to orders, which, as a mere child, I ſoon diſcovered to be unreaſonable, becauſe inconſiſtent and contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. Thus are we deſtined to experience a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of bitterneſs, with the recollection of our moſt innocent enjoyments.</p>
               <p>The circumſtances which, during my child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, occurred to faſhion my mind, were various; yet, as it would probably afford me more pleaſure to revive the fading remembrance of new-born delight, than you, my child, could feel in the peruſal, I will not entice you to ſtray with me into the verdant meadow, to ſearch for the flowers that youthful hopes ſcatter in every path; though as I write, I almoſt ſcent the freſh green of ſpring—of that ſpring which never returns!</p>
               <p>"I had two ſiſters, and one brother, younger than myſelf; my brother Robert was two years older, and might truly be termed the idol of his parents, and the torment of the reſt of the family.
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:035555_0103_1005618740E917E0"/>
Such indeed is the force of prejudice, that what was called ſpirit and wit in him, was cruelly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed as forwardneſs in me.</p>
               <p>"My mother had an indolence of character, which prevented her from paying much attention to our education. But the healthy breeze of a neighbouring heath, on which we bounded at pleaſure, volatilized the humours that improper food might have generated. And to enjoy open air and freedom, was paradiſe, after the unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural reſtraint of our fire-ſide, where we were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten obliged to ſit three or four hours together, without daring to utter a word, when my father was out of humour, from want of employment, or of a variety of boiſterous amuſement. I had however one advantage, an inſtructor, the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of my father, who, intended for the church, had of courſe received a liberal education. But, becoming attached to a young lady of great beauty and large fortune, and acquiring in the world ſome opinions not conſonant with the profeſſion for which he was deſigned, he accepted, with the moſt ſanguine expectations of ſucceſs, the offer of a nobleman to accompany him to India, as his confidential ſecretary.</p>
               <p>"A correſpondence was regularly kept up with
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:035555_0104_10056188C6652178"/>
the object of his affection; and the intricacies of buſineſs, peculiarly weariſome to a man of a ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic turn of mind, contributed, with a forced abſence, to increaſe his attachment. Every other paſſion was loſt in this maſter-one, and only ſerved to ſwell the torrent. Her relations, ſuch were his waking dreams, who had deſpiſed him, would court in their turn his alliance, and all the blandiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of taſte would grace the triumphs of love.—While he baſked in the warm ſunſhine of love, friendſhip alſo promiſed to ſhed its dewy freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for a friend, whom he loved next to his miſtreſs, was the confident, who forwarded the letters from one to the other, to elude the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of prying relations. A friend, falſe in ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar circumſtances, is, my deareſt girl, an old tale; yet, let not this example, or the frigid caution of cold-blooded moraliſts, make you endeavour to ſtifle hopes, which are the buds that naturally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold themſelves during the ſpring of life! Whilſt your own heart is ſincere, always expect to meet one glowing with the ſame ſentiments; for to fly from pleaſure, is not to avoid pain!</p>
               <p>"My uncle realized, by good luck, rather than management, a handſome fortune; and returning on the wings of love, loſt in the moſt enchanting reveries, to England, to ſhare it with his miſtreſs and his friend, he found them—united.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="unknown:035555_0105_1005618B0D9518B8"/>
"There were ſome circumſtances, not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for me to recite, which aggravated the guilt of the friend beyond meaſure, and the deception, which had been carried on to the laſt moment, was ſo baſe, it produced the moſt violent effect on my uncle's health and ſpirits.—His native country, the world! lately a garden of blooming ſweets, blaſted by treachery, ſeemed changed into a parched deſert, the abode of hiſſing ſerpents. Diſappointment rankled in his heart; and, brood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over his wrongs, he was attacked by a raging fever, followed by a derangement of mind, which only gave place to habitual melancholy, as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered more ſtrength of body.</p>
               <p>"Declaring an intention never to marry, his relations were ever cluſtering about him, paying the groſſeſt adulation to a man, who, diſguſted with mankind, received them with ſcorn, or bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſarcaſms. Something in my countenance pleaſed him, when I began to prattle. Since his return he appeared dead to affection; but I ſoon, by ſhowing him innocent fondneſs, became a favourite; and endeavouring to enlarge and ſtrengthen my mind, I grew dear to him in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as I imbibed his ſentiments. He had a forcible manner of ſpeaking, rendered more ſo by a certain impreſſive wildneſs of look and geſture,
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:035555_0106_1005618D45CDDAE8"/>
calculated to engage the attention of a young and ardent mind. It is not then ſurpriſing that I quickly adopted his opinions in preference, and reverenced him as one of a ſuperior order of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. He inculcated, with great warmth, ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect, and a lofty conſciouſneſs of acting right, independent of the cenſure or applauſe of the world; nay, he almoſt taught me to brave, and even deſpiſe its cenſure, when convinced of the rectitude of my own intentions.</p>
               <p>Endeavouring to prove to me that nothing which deſerved the name of love or friendſhip, exiſted in the world, he drew ſuch animated pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of his own feelings, rendered permanent by diſappointment, as imprinted the ſentiments ſtrongly on my heart, and animated my imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Theſe remarks are neceſſary to elucidate ſome peculiarities in my character, which by the world are indefinitely termed romantic.</p>
               <p>"My uncle's increaſing affection led him to viſit me often. Still unable to reſt in any place, he did not remain long in the country to ſoften domeſtic tyranny; but he brought me books, for which I had a paſſion, and they conſpired with his converſation, to make me form an ideal pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of life. I ſhall paſs over the tyranny of my
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:035555_0107_1005618FE61DD3E8"/>
father, much as I ſuffered from it; but it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to notice, that it undermined my mother's health; and that her temper, continually irritated by domeſtic bickering, became intolerably peeviſh.</p>
               <p>"My eldeſt brother was articled to a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring attorney, the ſhrewdeſt, and I may add, the moſt unprincipled man in that part of the country. As my brother generally came home every Saturday, to aſtoniſh my mother by exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting his attainments, he gradually aſſumed a right of directing the whole family, not excepting my father. He ſeemed to take a peculiar pleaſure in tormenting and humbling me; and if ever I ventured to complain of this treatment to either my father or mother, I was rudely rebuffed for preſuming to judge of the conduct of my eldeſt brother.</p>
               <p>"About this period a merchant's family came to ſettle in our neighbourhood. A manſion-houſe in the village, lately purchaſed, had been prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole ſpring, and the ſight of the coſtly furniture, ſent from London, had excited my mother's envy, and rouſed my father's pride. My ſenſations were very different, and all of a pleaſurable kind. I longed to ſee new characters, to break the tedious monotony of my life; and to
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:035555_0108_100561916B33CC98"/>
find a friend, ſuch as fancy pourtrayed. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not then deſcribe the emotion I felt the Sunday they made their appearance at church. My eyes were rivetted on the pillar round which I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected firſt to get a glimpſe of them, and darted forth to meet a ſervant who haſtily preceded a group of ladies, whoſe white robes and waving plumes, ſeemed to ſtream along the gloomy aiſle, diffuſing the light, by which I contemplated their figures.</p>
               <p>"We viſited them in form, and I quickly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the eldeſt daughter for my friend. The ſecond ſon, George, paid me particular attention, and finding his attainments and manners ſuperior to thoſe of the young men of the village, I began to imagine him ſuperior to the reſt of mankind. Had my home been more comfortable, or my previous acquaintance been more numerous, I ſhould not probably have been ſo eager to open my heart to new affections.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Venables, the merchant, had acquired a large fortune by unremitting attention to buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but his health declining rapidly, he was obliged to retire, before his ſon, George, had acquired ſufficient experience, to enable him to conduct their affairs on the ſame prudential plan,
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:035555_0109_10056193817EB0C0"/>
his father had invariably purſued. Indeed, he had laboured to throw off his authority, having deſpiſed his narrow plans and cautious ſpeculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The eldeſt ſon could not be prevailed on to enter the firm; and, to oblige his wife, and have peace in the houſe, mr. Venables had purchaſed a commiſſion for him in the guards.</p>
               <p>"I am now alluding to circumſtances which came to my knowledge long after; but it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, my deareſt child, that you ſhould know the character of your father, to prevent your deſpiſing your mother; the only parent inclined to diſcharge a parent's duty. In London, George had acquired habits of libertiniſm, which he care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully concealed from his father and his commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial connections. The maſk he wore, was ſo complete a covering of his real viſage, that the praiſe his father laviſhed on his conduct, and, poor miſtaken man! on his principles, contraſted with his brother's, rendered the notice he took of me peculiarly flattering. Without any fixed deſign, as I am now convinced, he continued to ſingle me out at the dance, preſs my hand at part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and utter expreſſions of unmeaning paſſion, to which I gave a meaning naturally ſuggeſted by the romantic turn of my thoughts. His ſtay in the country was ſhort; his manners did not entirely
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:035555_0110_100561967601F550"/>
pleaſe me; but when he left us, the colouring of my picture became more vivid—Whither did not my imagination lead me? In ſhort, I fancied myſelf in love—in love with the diſintereſtneſs, fortitude, generoſity, dignity, and humanity, with which I had inveſted the hero I dubbed. A cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance which ſoon after occurred, rendered all theſe virtues palpable. [The incident is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps worth relating on other accounts, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall deſcribe it diſtinctly.]</p>
               <p>"I had a great affection for my nurſe, old Mary, for whom I uſed often to work, to ſpare her eyes. Mary had a younger ſiſter, married to a ſailor, while ſhe was ſuckling me; for my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only ſuckled my eldeſt brother, which might be the cauſe of her extraordinary partiality. Peggy, Mary's ſiſter, lived with her, till her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, becoming a mate in a Weſt-India trader, got a little before-hand in the world. He wrote to his wife from the firſt port in the channel, after his moſt ſucceſsful voyage, to requeſt her to come to London to meet him; he even wiſhed her to determine on living there for the ſuture, to ſave him the trouble of coming to her the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he came on ſhore; and, to turn a penny by keeping a green-ſtall. It was too much to ſet out on a journey the moment he had finiſhed a voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:035555_0111_1005619893E31080"/>
and fifty miles by land was worſe than a thouſand leagues by ſea.</p>
               <p>"She packed up her alls, and came to London—but did not meet honeſt Daniel. A common misfortune prevented her—and the poor are bound to ſuffer for the good of their country—he was preſſed in the river—and never came on ſhore.</p>
               <p>"Peggy was miſerable in London, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as ſhe ſaid, 'the face of any living ſoul;' beſides her imagination had been employed, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating a month or ſix weeks' happineſs with her huſband. Daniel was to have gone with her to Sadler's Wells, and Weſtminſter Abbey, and to many ſights, which he knew ſhe never heard of in the country. Peggy too was thrifty, and how could ſhe manage to put his plan in execution alone? He had acquaintance, but ſhe did not know the very name of their places of abode. His letters were made up of—How do you does, and God bleſs yous—information was reſerved for the hour of meeting.</p>
               <p>"She too had her portion of information, near at heart. Molly and Jacky were grown ſuch little darlings, ſhe was almoſt angry that daddy did not ſee their little tricks. She had not half

the pleaſure ſhe ſhould have had from their prattle, could ſhe have recounted to him each night the pretty ſpeeches of the day. Some ſtories, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, were ſtored up—and Jacky could ſay pappa with ſuch a ſweet voice, it muſt delight his heart. Yet when ſhe came, and found no Daniel to greet her, when Jacky called pappa, ſhe wept, ſaying, 'God bleſs his innocent ſoul, that did not know what ſorrow was.'—But more ſorrow was in ſtore for Peggy, innocent as ſhe was.—Daniel was killed in the firſt engagement, and then the <hi>papa</hi> was agony ſounding to the heart.</p>
               <p>"She had lived ſparingly on his wages, while there was any hope of his return, but that gone, ſhe returned with a breaking heart to the country, to a little market town, nearly three miles from our village. She did not like to go to ſervice, to be ſnubbed about, after being her own miſtreſs. To put her children out to nurſe was impoſſible: How far would her wages go? and to ſend them to her huſband's pariſh, was to loſe her huſband twice over.</p>
               <p>"I had heard all from Mary, and made my uncle furniſh a little cottage for her, to enable her to fell—ſo ſacred was poor Daniel's advice, now he was dead and gone—a little fruit, toys,
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:035555_0113_1005619C3190FAE8"/>
and cakes. The minding of the ſhop did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire her whole time, nor even the keeping her children clean, and ſhe loved to ſee them clean; ſo ſhe took in waſhing, and altogether made a ſhift to earn bread for her children, ſtill weeping for Daniel, when Jacky's arch tricks made her think of his father,—It was pleaſant to work for her children. 'Yes; from morning till night, could ſhe have had a kiſs from their father, God reſt his ſoul! Yes; had it pleaſed Providence to have let him come back without a leg or an arm, it would have been the ſame thing to her—for ſhe did not love him becauſe he maintained them—no: ſhe had hands of her own.'</p>
               <p>"The country people were honeſt, and Peggy left her linen to dry very late. A recruiting party, as ſhe ſuppoſed, paſſing through, made free with a large waſh; for it was all ſwept away, including her own and her children's little ſtock.</p>
               <p>"This was a dreadful blow; two dozen of ſhirts, ſtocks, and handkerchiefs. She gave the money which ſhe had laid by for half a year's rent, and promiſed to pay two ſhillings a week till all was cleared; ſo ſhe did not loſe her employment. This two ſhillings a week, and the buying a few neceſſaries for the children, drove her ſo hard,
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:035555_0114_1005619F1D4E7100"/>
that ſhe had not a penny to pay her rent with, when a twelvemonth's became due.</p>
               <p>"She was now with Mary, and had juſt told her tale, which Mary inſtantly repeated—it was intended for my ear. Many houſes in this town, producing a borough intereſt, were included in the eſtate purchaſed by mr. Venables, and the attorney with whom my brother lived, was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed his agent, to collect and raiſe the rents.</p>
               <p>"He demanded Peggy's, and, in ſpite of her intreaties, her poor goods had been ſeized and fold. So that ſhe had not, and what was worſe her children, 'for ſhe had known ſorrow enough,' a bed to lie on. She knew that I was good-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured—right charitable, yet not liking to aſk for more than needs muſt, ſhe ſcorned to petition while people could any how be made to wait. But now, ſhould ſhe be turned out of doors, ſhe muſt expect nothing leſs than to loſe all her cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomers, and then ſhe muſt beg or ſtarve—and what would become of her children?—'Had Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel not been preſſed—but God knows beſt—all this could not have happened.'</p>
               <p>"I had two matraſſes on my bed; what did I want with two, when ſuch a worthy creature
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:035555_0115_100561A141414A00"/>
muſt lie on the ground? My mother would be angry, but I could conceal it till my uncle came down; and then I would tell him all the whole truth, and if he abſolved me, heaven would.</p>
               <p>"I begged the houſe-maid to come up ſtairs with me (ſervants always feel for the diſtreſſes of poverty, and ſo would the rich if they knew what it was). She aſſiſted me to tie up the matraſs; I diſcovering, at the ſame time, that one blanket would ſerve me till winter, could I perſuade my ſiſter, who ſlept with me, to keep my ſecret. She entering in the midſt of the package, I gave her ſome new feathers to ſilence her. We got the matraſs down the back ſtairs, unperceived, and I helped to carry it, taking with me all the money I had, and what I could borrow from my ſiſter.</p>
               <p>"When I got to the cottage, Peggy declared that ſhe would not take what I had brought ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly; but, when with all the eager eloquence inſpired by a decided purpoſe, I graſped her hand with weeping eyes, aſſuring her that my uncle would ſcreen her from blame, when he was once more in the country, deſcribing, at the ſame time, what ſhe would ſuffer in parting with her children, after keeping them ſo long from being thrown on the pariſh, ſhe reluctantly conſented.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="unknown:035555_0116_100561A2C5D312D8"/>
"My project of uſefulneſs ended not here; I determined to ſpeak to the attorney; he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently paid me compliments. His character did not intimidate me; but, imagining that Peggy muſt be miſtaken, and that no man could turn a deaf ear to ſuch a tale of complicated diſtreſs, I determined to walk to the town with Mary the next morning, and requeſt him to wait for the rent, and keep my ſecret till my uncle's return.</p>
               <p>"My repoſe was ſweet; and, waking with the firſt dawn of day, I bounded to Mary's cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. What charms does not a light heart ſpread over nature! Every bird that twittered in a buſh, every flower that enlivened the hedge, ſeemed placed there to awaken me to rapture—yes; to rapture. The preſent moment was full fraught with happineſs; and on futurity I beſtowed not a thought, excepting to anticipate my ſucceſs with the attorney.</p>
               <p>"This man of the world, with roſy face and ſimpering features, received me politely, nay kindly; liſtened with complacency to my remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances, though he ſcarcely heeded Mary's tears. I did not then ſuſpect, that my eloquence was in my complexion, the bluſh of ſeventeen, or that in a world where humanity to women is the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:035555_0117_100561A4EDD52780"/>
of advancing civilization, the beauty of a young girl was ſo much more intereſting than the diſtreſs of an old one. Preſſing my hand, he promiſed to let Peggy remain in the houſe as long as I wiſhed.—I more than returned the preſſure—I was ſo grateful and ſo happy. Emboldened by my innocent warmth, he then kiſſed me—and I did not draw back—I took it for a kiſs of charity.</p>
               <p>"Gay as a lark, I went to dine at mr. Vena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles'. I had previouſly obtained five ſhillings from my father, towards re-clothing the poor chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of my care, and prevailed on my mother to take one of the girls into the houſe, whom I determined to teach to work and read.</p>
               <p>"After dinner, when the younger part of the circle retired to the muſic room, I recounted with energy my tale; that is, I mentioned Peggy's diſtreſs, without hinting at the ſteps I had taken to relieve her. Miſs Venables gave me half-a-crown; the heir five ſhillings; but George ſat un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. I was cruelly diſtreſſed by the diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—I ſcarcely could remain on my chair; and could I have got out of the room unperceived, I ſhould have flown home, as if to run away from myſelf. After ſeveral vain attempts to riſe, I leaned my head againſt the marble chimney-piece,
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:035555_0118_100561A7F01A7400"/>
and gazing on the ever-greens that filled the fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, moralized on the vanity of human expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; regardleſs of the company. I was rouſed by a gentle tap on my ſhoulder from behind Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte's chair. I turned my head, and George ſlid a guinea into my hand, putting his finger to my mouth to enjoin me ſilence.</p>
               <p>"What a revolution took place, not only in my train of thoughts, but feelings! I trembled with emotion—now, indeed, I was in love.—Such delicacy too, to enhance his benevolence! I felt in my pocket every five minutes, only to feel the guinea; and its magic touch inveſted my hero with more than mortal beauty. My fancy had found a baſis to erect its model of perfection on; and quickly went to work, with all the happy credulity of youth, to conſider that heart as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to virtue, which had only obeyed a virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous impulſe. The bitter experience was yet to come, that has taught me how very diſtinct are the principles of virtue, from the caſual feelings from which they germinate.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII.</head>
               <p>"I HAVE perhaps dwelt too long on a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which is only of importance as it marks the progreſs of a deception that has been ſo fatal to my peace; and introduces to your notice a poor girl, whom, intending to ſerve, I led to ruin. Still it is probably that I was not entirely the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim of miſtake; and that your father, gradually faſhioned by the world, did not become quickly what I heſitate to call him—out of reſpect to my daughter.</p>
               <p>"But, to haſten to the more buſy ſcenes of my life. Mr. Venables and my mother died the ſame ſummer; and wholly engroſſed by my at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to her, I thought of little elſe. The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of her darling, my brother Robert, had a violent effect on her weakened mind; for, though boys may be reckoned the pillars of the houſe without doors, girls are often the only comfort within. They but too frequently waſte their health and ſpirits attending a dying parent, who
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:035555_0120_100561AB991A48E8"/>
leaves them in comparative poverty. After cloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with filial piety, a father's eyes, they are chaſed from the paternal roof, to make room for the firſt-born, the ſon, who is to carry the empty family-name down to poſterity; though, occupied with his own pleaſures, he ſcarcely thought of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging, in the decline of his parent's life, the debt contracted in his childhood. My mother's conduct led me to make theſe reflections. Great as was the fatigue I endured, and the affection my unceaſing ſolicitude evinced, of which my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeemed perfectly ſenſible, ſtill, when my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom I could hardly perſuade to remain a quarter of an hour in her chamber, was with her alone, a ſhort time before her death, ſhe gave him a little hoard, which ſhe had been ſome years accumulating.</p>
               <p>"During my mother's illneſs, I was obliged to manage my father's temper, who, from the lingering nature of her malady, began to imagine that it was merely fancy. At this period, an artful kind of upper ſervant attracted my father's attention, and the neighbours made many remarks on the finery, not honeſtly got, exhibited at even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſervice. But I was too much occupied with my mother to obſerve any change in her dreſs or behaviour, or to liſten to the whiſper of ſcandal.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="unknown:035555_0121_100561AEAEDF1D70"/>
"I ſhall not dwell on the death-bed ſcene, lively as is the remembrance, or on the emotion produced by the laſt graſp of my mother's cold hand; when bleſſing me, ſhe added, 'A little patience, and all will be over!' Ah! my child, how often have theſe words wrung mournfully in my ears—and I have exclaimed—'A little more patience, and I too ſhall be at reſt!'</p>
               <p>"My father was violently affected by her death, recollected inſtances of his unkindneſs, and wept like a child.</p>
               <p>"My mother had ſolemnly recommended my ſiſters to my care, and bid me be a mother to them. They, indeed, became more dear to me as they became more forlorn; for, during my mother's illneſs, I diſcovered the ruined ſtate of my father's circumſtances, and that he had only been able to keep up appearances, by the ſums which he bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from my uncle.</p>
               <p>"My father's grief, and conſequent tenderneſs to his children, quickly abated, the houſe grew ſtill more gloomy or riotous; and my refuge from care was again at mr. Venables'; the young 'ſquire having taken his father's place, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for the preſent, his ſiſter to preſide at his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,

George, though diſſatisfied with his portion of the fortune, which had till lately been all in trade, viſited the family as uſual. He was now full of ſpeculations in trade, and his brow became clouded with care. He ſeemed to relax in his attention to me, when the preſence of my uncle gave a new turn to his behaviour. I was too un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpecting, too diſintereſted, to trace theſe changes to their ſource.</p>
               <p>My home every day became more and more diſagreeable to me; my liberty was unneceſſarily abridged, and my books, on the pretext that they made me idle, were taken from me. My father's miſtreſs was with child, and he, doating on her, allowed or overlooked her vulgar manner of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannizing over us. I was indignant, eſpecially when I ſaw her endeavouring to attract, ſhall I ſay ſeduce? my younger brother. By allowing wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men but one way of riſing in the world, the foſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the libertiniſm of men, ſociety makes mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of them, and then their ignoble vices are brought forward as a proof of inferiority of intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</p>
               <p>The weariſomeneſs of my ſituation can ſcarcely be deſcribed. Though my life had not paſſed in the moſt even tenor with my mother, it was pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:035555_0123_100561B2DFBFEA18"/>
to what I was deſtined to endure with my father's miſtreſs, jealous of her illegitimate autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. My father's former occaſional tenderneſs, in ſpite of his violence of temper, had been ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me; but now he only met me with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs or portentous frowns. The houſe-keeper, as ſhe was now termed, was the vulgar deſpot of the family; and aſſuming the new character of a fine lady, ſhe could never forgive the contempt which was ſometimes viſible in my countenance, when ſhe uttered with pompoſity her bad Engliſh, or affected to be well-bred.</p>
               <p>To my uncle I ventured to open my heart; and he, with his wonted benevolence, began to conſider in what manner he could extricate me out of my preſent irkſome ſituation. In ſpite of his own diſappointment, or, moſt probably, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated by the feelings that had been petrified, not cooled, in all their ſanguine fervour, like a boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing torrent of lava ſuddenly daſhing into the ſea, he thought a marriage of mutual inclination (would envious ſtars permit it) the only chance for happineſs in this diſaſtrous world. George Venables had the reputation of being attentive to buſineſs, and my father's example gave great weight to this circumſtance; for habits in order of buſineſs would, he conceived, extend to the
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:035555_0124_100561B4665BA420"/>
regulation of the affections in domeſtic life. George ſeldom ſpoke in my uncle's company, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept to utter a ſhort judicious queſtion, or to make a pertinent remark, with all due deference to his ſuperior judgment; ſo that my uncle ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom left his company without obſerving, that the young man had more in him than people ſuppoſed.</p>
               <p>In this opinion he was not ſingular; yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, and I am not ſwayed by reſentment, theſe ſpeeches ſo juſtly poiſed, this ſilent defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when the animal ſpirits of other young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were throwing off uſeful ebullitions, were not the effect of thought or humility, but ſheer bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs of mind, and want of imagination. A colt of mettle will curvet and ſhew his paces. Yes; my dear girl, theſe prudent young men want all the fire neceſſary to ferment their facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and are characteriſed as wiſe, only becauſe they are not fooliſh. It is true, that George was by no means ſo great a favourite of mine as dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt year of our acquaintance; ſtill, as he often coincided in opinion with me, and echoed my ſentiments; and having myſelf no other attachment, I heard with pleaſure my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle's propoſal; but thought more of obtaining my freedom, than of my lover. But, when George,
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:035555_0125_100561B680E03288"/>
ſeemingly anxious for my happineſs, preſſed me to quit my preſent painful ſituation, my heart ſwelled with gratitude—I knew not that my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle had promiſed him five thouſand pounds.</p>
               <p>Had this truly generous man mentioned his intention to me, I ſhould have inſiſted on a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pound being ſettled on each of my ſiſters; George would have conteſted; I ſhould have ſeen his ſelfiſh ſoul; and—gracious God! have been ſpared the miſery of diſcovering, when too late, that I was united to a heartleſs, unprincipled wretch. All my ſchemes of uſefulneſs would not then have been blaſted. The tenderneſs of my heart would not have heated my imagination with viſions of the ineffable delight of happy love; nor would the ſweet duty of a mother have been ſo cruelly interrupted.</p>
               <p>But I muſt not ſuffer the fortitude I have ſo hardly acquired, to be undermined by unavailing regret. Let me haſten forward to deſcribe the turbid ſtream in which I had to wade—but let me exultingly declare that it is paſſed—my ſoul holds fellowſhip with him no more. He cut the Gordian knot, which my principles, miſtaken ones, reſpected; he diſſolved the tie, the fetters rather, that ate into my very vitals—and I ſhould
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:035555_0126_100561B972911568"/>
rejoice, conſcious that my mind is freed though confined in hell itſelf; the only place that even fancy can imagine more dreadful than my preſent abode.</p>
               <p>Theſe varying emotions will not allow me to proceed. I heave ſigh after ſigh; yet my heart is ſtill oppreſſed. For what am I reſerved? Why was I not born a man, or why was I born at all?</p>

               <p>"I RESUME my pen to fly from thought.—I was married; and we haſtened to London. I had purpoſed to take one of my ſiſters with me; for a ſtrong motive for marrying, was the deſire of having a home at which I could receive them, now their own grew ſo uncomfortable, as not to deſerve the cheering appellation. An objection was made to her accompanying me, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared plauſible; and I reluctantly acquieſced. I was however willingly allowed to take with me Molly, poor Peggy's daughter. London and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, are ideas commonly aſſociated in the country; and as blooming as May, ſhe bid adieu to Peggy with weeping eyes. I did not even feel hurt at the refuſal in relation to my ſiſter, till hearing what my uncle had done for me, I had the ſimplicity to requeſt, ſpeaking with warmth of their ſituation, that he would give them a thouſand pounds a-piece, which ſeemed to me but juſtice. He aſked me, giving me a kiſs, 'If I had loſt my ſenſes?' I ſtarted back as if I had
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:035555_0128_100561BD06D52158"/>
found a waſp in a roſe buſh. I expoſtulated. He ſneered; and the demon of diſcord entered our paradiſe, to poiſon with his peſtiferous breath every opening joy.</p>
               <p>"I had ſometimes obſerved defects in my huſband's underſtanding; but, led aſtray by a prevailing opinion, that goodneſs of diſpoſition is of the firſt importance in the relative ſituations of life, in proportion as I perceived the narrowneſs of his underſtanding, fancy enlarged the boundary of his heart. Fatal error! How quickly is the ſo-much-vaunted milkineſs of nature turned into gall, by an intercourſe with the world, if more generous juices do not ſuſtain the vital ſource of virtue!</p>
               <p>"One trait in my character was extreme cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity; but when my eyes were once opened, I ſaw but too clearly all I had before overlooked My huſband was ſunk in my eſteem; ſtill there are youthful emotions, which, for a while, fill up the chaſm of love and friendſhip. Beſides, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ſome time to enable me to ſee his whole character in a juſt light, or rather to allow it to become fixed. While circumſtances were ripen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my faculties, and cultivating my taſte, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and groſs relaxations were ſhutting his
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:035555_0129_100561BF0D5A26E0"/>
againſt any poſſibility of improvement, till, by ſtifling every ſpark of virtue in himſelf, he began to imagine that it no where exiſted.</p>
               <p>"Do not let me lead you aſtray, my child, I do not mean to aſſert that any human being is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely incapable of feeling the generous emotions, which are the foundation of every true principle of virtue; but they are frequently, I fear, ſo feeble, that, like the inflammable quality which more or leſs lurks in all bodies, they often lie for ever dormant; the circumſtances never occurring, neceſſary to call them into action.</p>
               <p>"I diſcovered, however, by chance, that, in conſequence of ſome loſſes in trade, the natural effect of his gambling deſire to ſtart ſuddenly into riches, the five thouſand pounds given me by my uncle, had been, paid very opportunely. This diſcovery, ſtrange as you may think the aſſertion, gave me pleaſure; my huſband's embarraſſments endeared me. I was glad to find an excuſe for his conduct to my ſiſters, and my mind became calmer.</p>
               <p>"My uncle introduced me to ſome literary ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and the theatres were a never-failing ſource of amuſement to me. My delighted eye followed
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:035555_0130_100561C1F1CD5420"/>
mrs. Siddons, when, with dignified delicacy, ſhe played Caliſta; and I involuntarily repeated after her, in the ſame tone, and with a long-drawn ſigh,
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>'Hearts like our's were pair'd—not match'd!'</hi>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"Theſe were, at firſt, ſpontaneous emotions, though, becoming acquainted with men of wit and poliſhed manners, I could not ſometimes help regretting my early marriage; and that, in my haſte to eſcape a temporary dependence, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pand my newly fledged wings, in an unknown ſky, I had been caught in a trap and caged for life. Still the novelty of London, and the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive fondneſs of my huſband, for he had ſome perſonal regard for me, made ſeveral months glide away. Yet, not forgetting the ſituation of my ſiſters, who were ſtill very young, I prevailed on my uncle to ſettle a thouſand pounds on each; and to place them in a ſchool near town, where I could frequently viſit, as well as have them at home with me.</p>
               <p>"I now tried to improve my huſband's taſte, but we had few ſubjects in common; indeed he ſoon appeared to have little reliſh for my ſociety, unleſs he was hinting to me the uſe he could make of my uncle's wealth. When we had company,

I was diſguſted by an oſtentatious diſplay of riches, and I have often quitted the room, to avoid liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening to exaggerated tales of money obtained by lucky hits.</p>
               <p>"With all my attention and affectionate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, I perceived that I could not become the friend or confident of my huſband. Every thing I learned relative to his affairs I gathered up by accident; and I vainly endeavoured to eſtabliſh at our fire-ſide, that ſocial converſe which often renders people of different characters dear to each other. Returning from the theatre, or any amuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing party, I frequently began to relate what I had ſeen and highly reliſhed; but with ſilent tacitur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity he ſoon ſilenced me. I ſeemed therefore gradually to loſe, in his ſociety, the ſoul, the ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies of which had juſt been in action. To ſuch a degree, in fact, did his cold, reſerved manner affect me that, after ſpending ſome days with me alone, I have imagined myſelf the moſt ſtupid creature in the world, till the abilities of ſome caſual viſitor convinced me that I had ſome dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant animation, and ſentiments above the duſt in which I had been grovelling. The very counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of my huſband changed; his complexion became ſallow, and all the charms of youth were vaniſhing with its vivacity.</p>

"I give you one view of the ſubject; but theſe experiments and alterations took up the ſpace of five years; during which period, I had almoſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctantly extorted ſeveral ſums from my uncle, to ſave my huſband, to uſe his own words, from deſtruction. At firſt it was to prevent bills being proteſted, to the injury of his credit; then to bail him; and afterwards to prevent an execution from entering the houſe. I began at laſt to conclude, that he would have made more exertions of his own to extricate himſelf, had he not relied on mine, cruel as was the taſk he impoſed on me; and I firmly determined that I would make uſe of no more pretexts.</p>
               <p>"From the moment I pronounced this deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, indifference on his part was changed into rudeneſs, or ſomething worſe.</p>

I retired to another apartment; I was glad, I own, to eſcape from his; for perſonal intimacy without affection, ſeemed to me the moſt degrading, as well as the moſt painful ſtate of which a woman of any taſte, not to ſpeak of the peculiar delicacy of foſtered ſenſibility, could be placed. But my huſband's fondneſs for women was of the groſſeſt

kind, and imagination was ſo wholly out of the queſtion, as to render his indulgences of this ſort entirely promiſcuous, and of the moſt brutal na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. My health ſuffered, before my heart was entirely eſtranged by the loathſome information; could I then have returned to his ſullied arms, but as a victim to the prejudices of mankind, who have made women the property of their huſbands? I diſcovered even by his converſation, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicated, that his favourites were wantons of the loweſt claſs, who could by their vulgar, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent mirth, which he called nature, rouſe his ſluggiſh ſpirits. Meretricious ornaments and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were neceſſary to attract his attention. He ſeldom looked twice at a modeſt woman, and ſat ſilent in their company; and the charms of youth and beauty had not the ſlighteſt effect on his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, unleſs the poſſeſſors were initiated in vice. His intimacy with profligate women, and his habits of thinking, gave him a contempt for fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male endowments; and he would repeat, when wine had looſed his tongue, moſt of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-place ſarcaſms levelled at them, by men who do not allow them to have minds, becauſe mind would be an impediment to groſs enjoyment. Men who are inferior to their fellow men, are always moſt anxious to eſtabliſh their ſuperiority over wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. But where are theſe reflections leading me?</p>

"Women who have loſt their huſbands' affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are juſtly reproved for neglecting their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and not taking the ſame pains to keep, as to gain a heart; but who thinks of giving the ſame advice to men, though women are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſtigmatized for being attached to fops; and from the nature of their education, are more ſuſceptible of diſguſt? Yet why a woman ſhould be expected to endure a ſloven, with more pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience than a man, and magnanimouſly to govern herſelf, I cannot conceive; unleſs it be ſuppoſed arrogant in her to look for reſpect as well as a maintainance. It is not eaſy to be pleaſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, after promiſing to love, in different cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, we are told that it is our duty. I cannot, I am ſure (though when attending the ſick, I never felt diſguſt) forget my own ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when riſing with health and ſpirit, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſcenting the ſweet morning, I have met my huſband at the breakfaſt table.

The ſquea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhneſs of ſtomach alone, produced by the laſt's intemperance, which he took no pains to conceal, deſtroyed my appetite. I think I now ſee him lolling in an arm-chair, in a dirty powdering

gown, ſoiled linen, ungartered ſtockings, and tangled hair, yawning and ſtretching himſelf. The newſpaper was called for, if not brought in on the tea-board, from which he would ſcarcely lift his eyes while I poured out the tea, excepting to aſk for ſome brandy to put into it, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that he could not eat. In anſwer to any queſtion, in his beſt humour, it was a drawling 'What do you ſay, child?' But if I demanded money for the houſe expences, which I put off till the laſt moment, his cuſtomary reply, often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced with an oath, was, 'Do you think me, madam, made of money?'—The butcher, the baker, muſt wait; and, what was worſe, I was often obliged to witneſs his ſurly diſmiſſion of tradeſmen, who were in want of their money, and whom I ſometimes paid with the preſents my uncle gave me for my own uſe.</p>
               <p>At this juncture my father's miſtreſs, by terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his conſcience, prevailed on him to marry her; he was already become a methodiſt; and my brother, who now practiſed for himſelf, had diſcovered a flaw in the ſettlement made on my mother's children, which ſat it aſide, and he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed my father, whoſe diſtreſs made him ſubmit to any thing, a tithe of his own, or rather our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>

My ſiſters had left ſchool, but were unable to endure home, which my father's wife rendered as diſagreeable as poſſible, to get rid of girls whom ſhe regarded as ſpies on her conduct—They were accompliſhed, yet you can (may you never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the ſame deſtitute ſtate!) ſcarcely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the trouble I had to place them in the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of governeſſes, the only one in which even a well-educated woman, with more than ordinary talents, can ſtruggle for a ſubſiſtence; and even this is a dependence next to menial. Is it then ſurpriſing, that ſo many forlorn women, with human paſſions and feelings, take refuge in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy? Alone in large manſions—I ſay alone, becauſe they had no companions with whom they could converſe on equal terms, or from whom they could expect the endearments of affection, they grew melancholy, and the ſound of joy made them ſad; and the youngeſt, having a more delicate frame, fell into a decline. It was with great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty that I, who now almoſt ſupported the houſe by loans from my uncle, could prevail on the <hi>maſter</hi> of it, to allow her a room to die in. I watched her ſick bed for ſome months, and then cloſed her eyes, gentle ſpirit! for ever. She was pretty, with very engaging manners; yet had never an opportunity to marry, excepting to a very old man. She had abilities ſufficient to have

ſhone in any profeſſion, had there been any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions for women, though ſhe ſhrunk at the name of milliner or mantua-maker, as degrading to a gentlewoman. I would not term this feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing falſe pride to any one but you, my child, whom I fondly hope to ſee (yes; I will indulge the hope for a moment!) poſſeſſed of that energy of character which gives dignity to any ſtation; and with that clear, firm ſpirit that will enable you to chooſe a ſituation for yourſelf, or ſubmit to be claſſed in the loweſt, if it be the only one in which you can be the miſtreſs of your own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>"Soon after the death of my ſiſter, an incident occurred, to prove to me that the heart of a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertine is dead to natural affection; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince me, that the being who has appeared all tenderneſs, to gratify a ſelfiſh paſſion, is as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of the innocent fruit of it, as of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, when the fit is over. I had caſually obſerved an old, mean-looking woman, who called on my huſband every two or three months to receive ſome money. One day, entering the paſſage of his little counting-houſe, as ſhe was going out, I heard her ſay, 'The child is very weak; ſhe cannot live long, ſhe will ſoon die out of your way, ſo you need not grudge her a little phyſic.'</p>

"'So much the better,' he replied—'and pray mind your own buſineſs, good woman.'</p>
               <p>"I was ſtruck by his unfeeling, inhuman tone of voice, and drew back, determined when the woman came again, to try to ſpeak to her, not out of curioſity, I had heard enough, but with the hope of being uſeful to a poor outcaſt girl.</p>
               <p>"A month or two elapſed before I ſaw this woman again; and then ſhe had a child in her hand that tottered along, ſcarcely able to ſuſtain her own weight. They were going away, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn at the hour mr. Venables was expected; he was now from home. I deſired the woman to walk into the parlour. She heſitated, yet obeyed. I aſſured her that I ſhould not mention to my huſband (the word ſeemed to weigh on my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration) that I had ſeen her, or his child. The woman ſtared at me with aſtoniſhment; and I turned my eyes on the ſqualid object that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied her. She could hardly ſupport herſelf, her complexion was ſallow, and her eyes inflamed, with an indeſcribable look of cunning, mixed with the wrinkles produced by the peeviſhneſs of pain.</p>
               <p>"'Poor child!' I exclaimed. 'Ah, you may well ſay poor child,' replied the woman. 'I

brought her here to ſee whether he would have the heart to look at her, and not get ſome advice. I do not know what they deſerve who nurſed her. Why, her legs bent under her like a bow, when ſhe came to me, and ſhe has never been well ſince; but, if they were no better paid than I am, it is not to be wondered at, ſure enough.'</p>
               <p>"On further enquiry, I was informed, that this miſerable ſpectacle was the daughter of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, a country girl, who caught mr. Venables' eye, and whom he ſeduced. On his marriage he ſent her away, her ſituation being too viſible. After her delivery, ſhe was thrown on the town; and died in an hoſpital within the year. The babe was ſent to a pariſh-nurſe, and afterwards to this woman, who did not ſeem much better; but what was to be expected from ſuch a cloſe bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain? She was only paid three ſhillings a week for board and waſhing.</p>
               <p>"The woman begged me to give her ſome old clothes for the child, aſſuring me that ſhe was almoſt afraid to aſk maſter for money to buy even a pair of ſhoes.</p>

               <p>"MY father's ſituation was now ſo diſtreſſing, that I prevailed on my uncle to accompany me to viſit him; and to lend me his aſſiſtance to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the whole property of the family from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the prey of my brother's rapacity; for, to extricate himſelf out of preſent difficulties, my father was totally regardleſs of futurity. I took down with me ſome preſents for my ſtep-mother; it did not require an effort for me to treat her with civility, or to forget the paſt.</p>
               <p>"This was the firſt time I had viſited my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive village, ſince my marriage. But with what different emotions did I return from the buſy world, with a heavy weight of experience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numbing my imagination, to ſcenes that whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered recollections of joy and hope moſt elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to my heart! The firſt ſcent of the wild flowers from the heath, thrilled through my veins, awakening every ſenſe to pleaſure.—The icy hand of deſpair ſeemed to be removed from my boſom;

and—forgetting my huſband—the nurtured viſions of a romantic mind, burſting on me with all their original wildneſs and gay exuberance, were again hailed as ſweet realities. I forgot, with equal facility, that I ever felt ſorrow, or knew care in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; while a tranſient rainbow ſtole athwart the cloudy ſky of deſpondency. The pictureſque form of ſeveral favourite trees, and the porches of rude cottages, with their ſmiling hedges, were recognized with the gladſome playfulneſs of child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh vivacity. I could have kiſſed the chickens that pecked on the common; and longed to pat the cows, and frolic with the dogs that ſported on it. I gazed with delight on the windmill, and thought it lucky that it ſhould be in motion, at the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I paſſed by; and entering the dear green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane, which led directly to the village, the ſound of the well-known rookery gave that ſentimental tinge to the varying ſenſations of my active ſoul, which only ſerved to heighten the luſtre of the luxuriant ſcenery. But, ſpying, as I advanced, the ſpire, peeping over the withered tops of the aged elms that compoſed the rookery, my thoughts flew immediately to the church-yard, and tears of affection, ſuch was the effect of my imagination, bedewed my mother's grave! Sorrow gave place to devotional feelings! I wandered through the church in fancy, as I uſed ſometimes to do on a

Saturday evening. I recollected with what fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour I addreſſed the God of my youth: and once more with rapturous love looked above my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows to the Father of nature. I pauſe—feeling forcibly all the emotions I am deſcribing; and reminded, as I regiſter my ſorrows, of the ſublime calm I have felt, when in ſome tremendous ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, my ſoul reſted on itſelf, and ſeemed to fill the univerſe—I inſenſibly breathe ſoft, huſhing every wayward emotion, as if fearing to ſully with a ſigh, a contentment ſo extatic.</p>
               <p>"Having ſettled my father's affairs, and, by my exertions in his favour, made my brother my ſworn foe, I returned to London. My huſband's conduct was now changed; I had during my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, received ſeveral affectionate, penitential letters from him; and he ſeemed on my arrival, to wiſh by his behaviour to prove his ſincerity. I could not then conceive why he acted thus; and, when the ſuſpicion darted into my head, that it might ariſe from obſerving my increaſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence with my uncle, I almoſt deſpiſed myſelf for imagining that ſuch a degree of debaſing ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſhneſs could exiſt.</p>
               <p>"He became, unaccountable as was the change, tender and attentive; and, attacking my weak
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:035555_0144_100561DFA8333E98"/>
ſide, made a confeſſion of his follies, and lamented the embarraſſments in which I, who merited a far different fate, might be involved. He beſought me to aid him with my counſel, praiſed my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and appealed to the tenderneſs of my heart.</p>
               <p>"This conduct only inſpired me with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion. I wiſhed to be his friend; but love had ſpread his roſy pinions, and fled far, far away; and had not (like ſome exquiſite perfumes, the fine ſpirit of which is continually mingling with the air) left a fragrance behind, to mark where he had-ſhook his wings. My huſband's renewed careſſes then became hateful to me; his bruta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity was tolerable, compared to his diſtaſteful fondneſs. Still, compaſſion, and the fear of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting his ſuppoſed feelings, by a want of ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy, made me diſſemble, and do violence to my delicacy. What a taſk!</p>
               <p>"Thoſe who ſupport a ſyſtem of what I term falſe refinement, and will not allow great part of love in the female, as well as the male breaſt, to ſpring in ſome reſpects involuntarily, may not admit that charms are as neceſſary to feed the paſſion, as virtues to convert the mellowing ſpirit into friendſhip. To ſuch obſervers I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:035555_0145_100561E1D3FEE968"/>
to ſay, any more than to the moraliſts, who inſiſt that women ought to, and can love their huſbands, becauſe it is their duty. To you, my child, I may add, with a heart tremblingly alive to your future conduct, ſome obſervations, dictated by my preſent feelings, on calmly reviewing this period of my life. When noveliſts or moraliſts praiſe as a virtue, a woman's coldneſs of conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and want of paſſion; and make her yield to the ardour of her lover, out of ſheer compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or to promote a frigid plan of future com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, I am diſguſted.—They may be good women, in the ordinary acceptation of the phraſe, and do no harm;—but they appear to me not to have thoſe 'finely faſhioned nerves,' which render the ſenſes exquiſite. They may poſſeſs tenderneſs; but they want that fire of the imagination, which produces <hi>active</hi> ſenſibility, and <hi>poſitive</hi> virtue.—How does the woman deſerve to be character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized, who marries one man, with a heart and imagination devoted to another? Is ſhe not an object of pity or contempt, when thus ſacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly violating the purity of her own feelings? Nay, it is as indelicate, when ſhe is indifferent, unleſs ſhe be conſtitutionally inſenſible; then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is a mere affair of barter; and I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with the ſecrets of trade. Yes; ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly as I wiſh you to poſſeſs true rectitude of
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:035555_0146_100561E40818F7B0"/>
mind, and purity of affection, I muſt inſiſt that a heartleſs conduct is the contrary of virtuous. Truth is the only baſis of virtue; and we cannot, without depraving our minds, endeavour to pleaſe a lover or a huſband, but in proportion as he pleaſes us. Men, more effectually to enſlave us, may inculcate this partial morality, and loſe ſight of virtue in ſubdividing it into the duties of particular ſtations; but let us not bluſh for nature without a cauſe!</p>
               <p>"After theſe remarks, I am aſhamed to own that I was pregnant. The greateſt ſacrifice of my principles in my whole life, was the allowing my huſband again to be familiar with my perſon, though to this cruel act of ſelf-denial, when I wiſhed the earth to open and ſwallow me, you owe your birth; and I the unutterable pleaſure of being a mother. There was ſomething of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy in my huſband's bridal attentions; but now his tainted breath, pimpled face, and blood-ſhot eyes, were not more repugnant to my ſenſes, than his groſs manners, and loveleſs familiarity to my taſte.</p>
               <p>"A man would only be expected to maintain; yes, barely grant a ſubſiſtence, to a woman ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered odious by habitual intoxication; but who
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:035555_0147_100561E6B254CFB8"/>
would expect him, or think it poſſible to love her? And unleſs 'youth, and genial years were flown,' it would be thought equally unreaſonable to inſiſt, (under penalty of) forfeiting almoſt every thing reckoned valuable in life, that he ſhould not love another: whilſt woman, weak in reaſon, impotent in will, is required to moralize, ſentimentalize herſelf to ſtone, and pine her life away, labouring to reform her embruted mate. He may even ſpend in diſſipation, and intemperance, the very intemperance which renders him ſo hateful, her property, and by ſtinting her expenſes, not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit her to beguile in ſociety, a weariſome joyleſs life; for over their mutual fortune ſhe has no power, it muſt all paſs through his hand. And if ſhe be a mother, and in the preſent ſtate of women, it is a great misfortune to be prevented from diſcharging the duties, and cultivating the affections of one, what has ſhe not to endure?—But I have ſuffered the tenderneſs of one to lead me into reflections that I did not think of making, to interrupt my narrative—yet the full heart will overflow.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Venables' embarraſſments did not now endear him to me; ſtill, anxious to befriend him, I endeavoured to prevail on him to retrench his expenſes; but he had always ſome plauſible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:035555_0148_100561E837141900"/>
to give, to juſtify his not following my advice. Humanity, compaſſion, and the intereſt produced by a habit of living together, made me try to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and ſympathize with him; but, when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected that I was bound to live with ſuch a being for ever—my heart died within me; my deſire of improvement became languid, and baleful, corroding melancholy took poſſeſſion of my ſoul. Marriage had baſtiled me for life. I diſcovered in myſelf a capacity for the enjoyment of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious pleaſures exiſtence affords; yet, fettered by the partial laws of ſociety, this fair globe was to me an univerſal blank.</p>
               <p>"When I exhorted my huſband to economy, I referred to himſelf. I was obliged to practiſe the moſt rigid, or contract debts, which I had too much reaſon to fear would never be paid. I deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed this paltry privilege of a wife, which can only be of uſe to the vicious or inconſiderate, and determined not to increaſe the torrent that was bearing him down. I was then ignorant of the extent of his fraudulent ſpeculations, whom I was bound to honour and obey.</p>
               <p>"A woman neglected by her huſband, or whoſe manners form a ſtriking contraſt with his, will always have men on the watch to ſoothe and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

her. Beſides, the forlorn ſtate of a neglected woman, not deſtitute of perſonal charms, is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly intereſting, and rouſes that ſpecies of pity, which is ſo near akin, it eaſily ſlides into love. A man of feeling thinks not of ſeducing, he is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſeduced by all the nobleſt emotions of his ſoul. He figures to himſelf all the ſacrifices a woman of ſenſibility muſt make, and every ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in which his imagination places her, touches his heart, and fires his paſſions. Longing to take to his boſom the ſhorn lamb, and bid the droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing buds of hope revive, benevolence changes into paſſion; and ſhould he then diſcover that he is beloved, honour binds him faſt, though foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he may afterwards be obliged to pay ſevere damages to the man, who never appeared to value his wife's ſociety, till he found that there was a chance of his being indemnified for the loſs of it.</p>
               <p>"Such are the partial laws enacted by men; for, only to lay a ſtreſs on the dependent ſtate of a woman in the grand queſtion of the comforts ariſing from the poſſeſſion of property, ſhe is (even in this article) much more injured by the loſs of the huſband's affection, than he by that of his wife; yet where is ſhe, condemned to the ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of a deſerted home, to look for a compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:035555_0150_100561EC7579A2E0"/>
from the woman, who ſeduces him from her? She cannot drive an unfaithful huſband from his houſe, nor ſeparate, or tear, his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from him, however culpable he may be; and he, ſtill the maſter of his own fate, enjoys the ſmiles of a world, that would brand her with infamy, did ſhe, ſeeking conſolation, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to retaliate.</p>
               <p>"Theſe remarks are not dictated by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; but merely by the compaſſion I feel for many amiable women, the <hi>out-laws</hi> of the world. For myſelf, never encouraging any of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances that were made to me, my lovers dropped off like the untimely ſhoots of ſpring. I did not even coquet with them; becauſe I found, on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining myſelf, I could not coquet with a man without loving him a little; and I perceived that I ſhould not be able to ſtop at the line of what are termed <hi>innocent freedoms,</hi> did I ſuffer any. My reſerve was then the conſequence of delicacy. Freedom of conduct has emancipated many wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's minds; but my conduct has moſt rigidly been governed by my principles, till the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my underſtanding has enabled me to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the fallacy of prejudices at war with nature and reaſon.</p>

"Shortly after the change I have mentioned in my huſband's conduct, my uncle was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by his declining health, to ſeek the ſuccour of a milder climate, and embark for Liſbon. He left his will in the hands of a friend, an eminent ſolicitor; he had previouſly queſtioned me rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to my ſituation and ſtate of mind, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared very freely, that he could place no reliance on the ſtability of my huſband's profeſſions. He had been deceived in the unfolding of his character; he now thought it fixed in a train of actions that would inevitably lead to ruin and diſgrace.</p>
               <p>"The evening before his departure, which we ſpent alone together, he folded me to his heart, uttering the endearing appellation of—'child'—My more than father! why was I not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to perform the laſt duties of one, and ſmooth the pillow of death? He ſeemed by his manner to be convinced that he ſhould never ſee me more; yet requeſted me, moſt earneſtly, to come to him, ſhould I be obliged to leave my huſband. He had before expreſſed a ſorrow at hearing of my pregnancy, having determined to prevail on me to accompany him, till I informed him of that circumſtance. He expreſſed himſelf unfeignedly ſorry that any new tie ſhould bind
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:035555_0152_100561F0B515D800"/>
me to a man whom he thought ſo incapable of eſtimating my value;—ſuch was the kind lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of affection.</p>
               <p>"I muſt repeat his own words; they made an indelible impreſſion on my mind:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>The marriage ſtate is certainly that in which women, generally ſpeaking, can be moſt uſeful; but I am far from thinking that a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, once married, ought to conſider the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement as indiſſoluble (eſpecially if there be no children to reward her for ſacrificing her feelings) in caſe her huſband merits neither her love, nor eſteem. Eſteem will often ſupply the place of love, and prevent a woman from being wretched, though it may not make her happy. The magnitude of a ſacrifice ought always to bear ſome proportion to the utility in view; and for a woman to live with a man for whom ſhe can cheriſh neither affection nor eſteem, or even be of any uſe to him, excepting in the light of a houſe-keeper, is an abjectneſs of condition, the enduring of which no concurrence of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances can ever make a duty in the ſight of God or juſt men. If indeed ſhe ſubmits to it merely to be maintained in idleneſs, ſhe has no right to complain bitterly of her fate, or to
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:035555_0153_100561F2D7F56470"/>
act, as a perſon of independent character might, as if ſhe had a title to diſregard general rules.</p>
                  <p>But the misfortune is, that many women only ſubmit in appearance, and forfeit their own reſpect to ſecure their reputation in the world. The ſituation of a woman ſeparated from her huſband is undoubtedly very different from that of a man who has left his wife. He, with lordly dignity, has ſhaken off a clog; and the allowing her food and raiment is thought ſufficient to ſecure his reputation from taint. And, ſhould ſhe have been inconſiderate, he will be celebrated for his generoſity and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance. Such is the reſpect paid to the maſter-key of property! A woman, on the contrary, reſigning what is termed her natural protector (though he never was ſo, but in name), is deſpiſed and ſhunned for aſſerting the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of mind diſtinctive of a rational being, and ſpurning at ſlavery.</p>
               </q>
               <p>"During the remainder of the evening, my uncle's tenderneſs led him frequently to revert to the ſubject, and utter, with increaſing warmth, ſentiments to the ſame purport. At length it was neceſſary to ſay 'Farewel!'—and we parted—gracious God! to meet no more.</p>

               <p>"A GENTLEMAN of large fortune and of poliſhed manners, had lately viſited very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently at our houſe, and treated me, if poſſible, with more reſpect than mr. Venables paid him; my pregnancy was not yet viſible, his ſociety was a great relief to me, as I had for ſome time paſt, to avoid expence, confined myſelf very much at home. I ever diſdained unneceſſary, perhaps even prudent concealments—and my huſband, with great eaſe, diſcovered the amount of my uncle's parting preſent. A copy of a writ was the ſtale pretext to extort it from me; and I had ſoon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe that it was fabricated for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. I acknowledge my folly in thus suffering myſelf to be continually impoſed on. I had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to my reſolution not to apply to my uncle, on the part of my huſband, any more; yet, when I had received a ſum ſufficient to ſupply my own wants, and to enable me to purſue a plan I had in view, to ſettle my younger brother in a reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able employment, I allowed myſelf to be duped by mr. Venables' ſhallow pretences, and hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical profeſſions</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="unknown:035555_0155_100561F88EA4B010"/>
"Thus did he pillage me and my family—thus fruſtrate all my plans of uſefulneſs. Yet this was the man I was bound to reſpect and eſteem: as if reſpect and eſteem depended on an arbitrary will of our own! But a wife being as much a man's property as his horſe, or his aſs, ſhe has nothing that ſhe can call her own. He may uſe any means to get at what the law conſiders as his, the moment his wife is in poſſeſſion of it, even to the forcing of a lock, as mr. Venables did, to ſearch for notes in my writing-deſk—and all this is done with a ſhew of equity—becauſe, forſooth, he is reſponſible for her maintenance.</p>
               <p>"The tender mother cannot <hi>lawfully</hi> ſnatch from the gripe of the gambling ſpendthrift, or beaſtly drunkard, unmindful of his offspring, the fortune which falls to her by chance: or (ſo flagrant is the injuſtice) what ſhe earns by her own exertions. No; he can rob her with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity, even to waſte publicly on a courtezan—and the laws of her country—if women have a country—afford her no protection or redreſs from the oppreſſor, unleſs ſhe have the plea of bodily fear; yet how many ways are there of goading the ſoul almoſt to madneſs, equally unmanly, though not ſo mean? When ſuch laws were framed, ſhould not impartial lawgivers have firſt

decreed, in the ſtyle of a great aſſembly, who recognized the exiſtence of an <hi>être ſuprême,</hi> to fix the national belief, that the huſband ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be wiſer and more virtuous than his wife, in order to entitle him, with a ſhew of juſtice, to keep this idiot, or perpetual minor, for ever in bondage. But I muſt have done—on this ſubject, my indignation continually runs away with me.</p>
               <p>"The company of the gentleman I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned, who had a general acquaintance with literature and ſubjects of taſte, was grateful to me; my countenance brightened up as he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, and I unaffectedly expreſſed the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure I felt. The amuſement his converſation afforded me, made it eaſy to comply with my huſband's requeſt, to endeavour to render our houſe agreeable to him.</p>
               <p>"His attentions became more pointed; but as I was not of the number of women, whoſe virtue, as it is termed, immediately takes alarm, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured, rather by raillery than ſerious expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation, to give a different turn to his converſation. He aſſumed a new mode of attack, and I was, for a while, the dupe of his pretended friendſhip.</p>
               <p>"I had, merely in the ſtile of <hi>badinage,</hi> boaſted
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:035555_0157_100561FC72DAD068"/>
of my conqueſt, and repeated his lover-like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments to my huſband. But he begged me, for God's ſake, not to affront his friend, or I ſhould deſtroy all his projects, and be his ruin. Had I had more affection for my huſband, I ſhould have expreſſed my contempt of this time-ſerving politeneſs: now I imagined that I only felt pity; yet it would have puzzled a caſuiſt to point out in what the exact difference conſiſted.</p>
               <p>"This friend began now, in confidence, to diſcover to me the real ſtate of my huſband's af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. 'Neceſſity,' ſaid mr. S—; why ſhould I reveal his name? for he affected to palliate the conduct he could not excuſe, 'had led him to take ſuch ſteps, by accommodation bills, buying goods on credit, to ſell them for ready money, and ſimilar tranſactions, that his character in the commercial world was gone. He was conſidered,' he added, lowering his voice, 'on 'Change as a ſwindler.'</p>
               <p>"I felt at that moment the firſt maternal pang. Aware of the evils my ſex have to ſtruggle with, I ſtill wiſhed, for my own conſolation, to be the mother of a daughter; and I could not bear to think, that the <hi>ſins</hi> of her father's entailed diſgrace ſhould be added to the ills to which woman is heir.</p>

"So completely was I deceived by theſe ſhows of friendſhip (nay, I believe, according to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, mr. S—really was my friend) that I began to conſult him reſpecting the beſt mode of retrieving my huſband's character: it is the good name of a woman only that "ſets to riſe no more." I knew not that he had beeen drawn into a whirlpool, out of which he had not the energy to attempt to eſcape. He ſeemed indeed deſtitute of the power of employing his faculties in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular purſuit. His principles of action were ſo looſe, and his mind ſo uncultivated, that every thing like order appeared to him in the ſhape of reſtraint; and, like men in the ſavage ſtate, he required the ſtrong ſtimulus of hope or fear, produced by wild ſpeculations, in which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of others went for nothing, to keep his ſpirits awake.—He one time profeſſed patriotiſm, but he knew not what it was to feel honeſt indignation; and pretended to be an advocate for liberty, when, with as little affection for the human race as for individuals, he thought of nothing but his own gratification. He was juſt ſuch a citizen as a father. The ſums he adroitly obtained by a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the laws of his country, as well as thoſe of humanity, he would allow a miſtreſs to ſquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; though ſhe was, with the ſame <hi>ſang froid,</hi>

conſigned, as were his children, to poverty, when another proved more attractive.</p>
               <p>"On various pretences, his friend continued to viſit me; and, obſerving my want of money, he tried to induce me to accept of pecuniary aid; but this offer I abſolutely rejected, though it was made with ſuch delicacy, I could not be diſpleaſed.</p>
               <p>"One day he came, as I thought, accidentally to dinner. My huſband was very much engaged in buſineſs, and quitted the room ſoon after the cloth was removed. We converſed as uſual, till confidential advice led again to love. I was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely mortified. I had a ſincere regard for him, and hoped that he had an equal friendſhip for me. I therefore began mildly to expoſtulate with him. This gentleneſs he miſtook for coy encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and he would not be diverted from the ſubject. Perceiving his miſtake, I ſeriouſly aſked him how, uſing ſuch language to me, he could profeſs to be my huſband's friend? A ſignificant ſneer excited my curioſity, and he, ſuppoſing this to be my only ſcruple, took a letter deliberately out of his pocket, ſaying, 'Your huſband's ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is not inflexible. How could you, with your diſcernment, think it ſo? Why, he left the room this very day on purpoſe to give me an
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:035555_0160_10055656650FC330"/>
opportunity to explain myſelf; <hi>he</hi> thought me too timid—too tardy.'</p>
               <p>"I ſnatched the letter with indeſcribable emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The purport of it was to invite him to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and to ridicule his chivalrous reſpect for me. He aſſured him, 'that every woman had her price, and, with groſs indecency, hinted, that he ſhould be glad to have the duty of a huſband ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off his hands. Theſe he termed <hi>liberal ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> He adviſed him not to ſhock my roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic notions, but to attack my credulous generoſity, and weak pity; and concluded with requeſting him to lend him five hundred pounds for a month or ſix weeks.' I read this letter twice over; and the firm purpoſe it inſpired, calmed the riſing tumult of my ſoul. I roſe deliberately, requeſted mr. S—to wait a moment, and inſtantly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the counting-houſe, deſired mr. Vena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to return with me to the dining-parlour.</p>
               <p>"He laid down his pen, and entered with me, without obſerving any change in my countenance. I ſhut the door, and, giving him the letter, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply aſked, 'whether he wrote it, or was it a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery?'</p>
               <p>"Nothing could equal his confuſion. His
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:035555_0161_100562035EA62160"/>
friend's eye met his, and he muttered ſomething about a joke—But I interrupted him—'It is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient—We part for ever.'</p>
               <p>"I continued with ſolemnity, 'I have borne with your tyranny and infidelities. I diſdain to utter what I have borne with. I thought you unprincipled, but not ſo decidedly vicious. I formed a tie in the ſight of heaven—I have held it ſacred; even when men, more conformable to my taſte, have made me feel—I deſpiſe all ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge! that I was not dead to love. Neglected by you, I have reſolutely ſtifled the enticing emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and reſpected the plighted faith you out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged. And you dare now to inſult me, by ſelling me to proſtitution!—Yes—equally loſt to delicacy and principle—you dared ſacrilegiouſly to barter the honour of the mother of your child.'</p>
               <p>"Then, turning to mr. S—, I added—'I call on you, ſir, to witneſs,' and I lifted my hands and eyes to heaven, 'that, as ſolemnly as I took his name, I now abjure it,' I pulled off my ring, and put it on the table; 'and that I mean to quit his houſe, never to enter it more. I will provide for myſelf and child. I leave him as free as I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to be myſelf—he ſhall be anſwerable for no debts of mine.'</p>

"Aſtoniſhment cloſed their lips, till mr. Vena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, gently puſhing his friend, with a forced ſmile, out of the room, nature for a moment pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, and, appearing like himſelf, he turned round, burning with rage, to me:—but there was no terror in the frown, excepting when contraſted with the malignant ſmile which preceded it. He bade me 'leave the houſe at my peril; told me he deſpiſed my threats; I had no reſource; I could not ſwear the peace againſt him!—I was not afraid of my life!—He had never ſtruck me!'</p>
               <p>"He threw the letter in the fire, which I had incautiouſly left in his hands; and, quitting the room, locked the door on me.</p>
               <p>"When left alone, I was a moment or two before I could recollect myſelf. One ſcene had ſucceeded another with ſuch rapidity, I almoſt doubted whether I was reflecting on a real event. 'Was I, indeed, free?'—Yes; free I termed my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when I decidedly perceived the conduct I ought to adopt. How had I panted for liberty—liberty, that I would have purchaſed at any price, but that of my own eſteem! I roſe and ſhook myſelf; opened the window, and methought the air never ſmelled ſo ſweet. The face of heaven grew fairer as I viewed it, and the clouds ſeemed
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:035555_0163_10056208691AFEB8"/>
to flit away obedient to my wiſhes, to give my ſoul room to expand. I was all ſoul, and (wild as it may appear) felt as if I could have diſſolved in the ſoft balmy gale that kiſſed my cheek, or have glided below the horizon, on the glowing, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending beams. A ſeraphic ſatisfaction animated, without agitating my ſpirits, and my imagination collected, in viſions ſublimely terrible, or ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly beautiful, an immenſe variety of the endleſs images, which nature affords, and fancy combines, of the grand and fair. The luſtre of theſe bright pictureſque ſketches faded with the ſetting ſun;—but I was ſtill alive to the calm delight they had diffuſed through my heart.</p>
               <p>"There may be advocates for matrimonial obedience, who, making a diſtinction between the duty of a wife and of a human being, may blame my conduct—To them I write not—my felings are not for them to analyze; and may you, my child, never be able to aſcertain, by heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rending experience, what your mother felt before the preſent emancipation of her mind!</p>
               <p>"I began to write a letter to my father, after cloſing one to my uncle; not to aſk advice, but to ſignify my determination; when I was interrupted by the entrance of mr. Venables. His manner
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:035555_0164_10056209EE7860A8"/>

His views on my uncle's fortune made him averſe to my quitting the houſe, or he would, I am convinced, have been glad to have ſhaken off even the ſlight reſtraint my preſence impoſed on him; the reſtraint of ſhowing me ſome reſpect. So far from having an affection for me, he really hated me, becauſe he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that I muſt deſpiſe him.</p>
               <p>"He told me, that, 'As I now had had time to cool and reflect, he did not doubt but that my prudence, and nice ſenſe of propriety, would lead me to overlook what was paſſed.'</p>
               <p>"'Reflection,' I replied, 'had only confirmed my purpoſe, and no power on earth could divert me from it.'</p>
               <p>"Endeavouring to aſſume a ſoothing voice and look, when he would willingly have tortured me, to force me to feel his power, his countenance had an infernal expreſſion, when he deſired me, 'Not to expoſe myſelf to the ſervants, by obliging him to confine me in my apartment; if then I would give my promiſe not to quit the houſe precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tately, I ſhould be free—and—.' I declared, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting him, that I would promiſe nothing. I had no meaſures to keep with him—I was reſolved, and would not condeſcend to ſubterfuge.'</p>

"He muttered, 'that I ſhould ſoon repent of theſe prepoſterous airs; and ordering tea to be carried into my little ſtudy, which had a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with my bed-chamber, he once more locked the door upon me, and left me to my own meditations. I had paſſively followed him up ſtairs, not wiſhing to fatigue myſelf with unavail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exertion.</p>
               <p>"Nothing calms the mind like a fixed purpoſe. I felt as if I had heaved a thouſand weight from my heart; the atmoſphere ſeemed lightened; and, if I execrated the inſtitutions of ſociety, which thus enabled men to tyrannize over women, it was almoſt a diſintereſted ſentiment. I diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded preſent inconveniences, when my mind had done ſtruggling with itſelf—when reaſon and inclination had ſhaken hands, and were at peace. I had no longer the cruel taſk before me, in end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs perſpective, aye, during the tedious for ever of life, of labouring to overcome my repugnance—of labouring to extinguiſh the hopes, the may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be's of a lively imagination. Death I had hailed as my only chance of deliverance; but, while exiſtence had ſo many charms, and life promiſed happineſs, I ſhrunk from the icy arms of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known tyrant, though far more inviting than thoſe of the man, to whom I found myſelf bound with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:035555_0166_1005620E90A01698"/>
any other alternative, and was content to lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger a little longer, waiting for I know not what, rather than leave 'the warm precincts of the chearful day,' and all the unenjoyed affection of my nature.</p>
               <p>"My preſent ſituation gave a new turn to my reflection; and I wondered (now the film ſeemed to be withdrawn, that obſcured the piercing ſight of reaſon) how I could, previouſly to the deciding outrage, have conſidered myſelf as everlaſtingly united to vice and folly! 'Had an evil genius caſt a ſpell at my birth; or a daemon ſtept out of chaos, to perplex my underſtanding, and enchain my will, with deluſive prejudices?'</p>
               <p>"I purſued this train of thinking; it led me out of myſelf, to expatiate on the miſery peculiar to my ſex. 'Are not,' 'I thought, the deſpots for ever ſtigmatiſed, who, in the wantonneſs of power, commanded even the moſt atrocious criminals to be chained to dead bodies? though ſurely thoſe laws are much more inhuman, which forge adamantine ſetters to bind minds together, that never can mingle in ſocial communion!

Venables en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered my chamber; and, with calm audacity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring to go to bed, he bade me make haſte, 'for that was the beſt place for huſbands and wives to end their differences.' He had been drinking plentifully to aid his courage.</p>
               <p>"I did not at firſt deign to reply. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that he affected to take my ſilence for conſent, I told him that, 'If he would not go to another bed, or allow me, I ſhould ſit up in my ſtudy all night.' He attempted to pull me into the chamber, half joking. But I reſiſted; and, as he had determined not to give me any reaſon for ſaying that he uſed violence, after a few more efforts, he retired, curſing my obſtinacy, to bed.</p>
               <p>"I ſat muſing ſome time longer; then throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my cloak around me, prepared for ſleep on a ſofa. And, ſo fortunate ſeemed my deliverance, ſo ſacred the pleaſure of being thus wrapped up
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:035555_0168_10056214018B89D0"/>
in myſelf, that I ſlept profoundly, and woke with a mind compoſed to encounter the ſtruggles of the day. Mr. Venables did not wake till ſome hours after; and then he came to me half-dreſſed, yawning and ſtretching, with haggard eyes, as if he ſcarcely recollected what had paſſed the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding evening. He fixed his eyes on me for a moment, then, calling me a fool, aſked, 'How long I intended to continue this pretty farce? For his part, he was deviliſh ſick of it; but this was the plague of marrying women who pretend to know ſomething.'</p>
               <p>"I made no other reply to this harangue, than to ſay, 'That he ought to be glad to get rid of a woman ſo unfit to be his companion—and that any change in my conduct would be mean diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation; for maturer reflection only gave the ſacred ſeal of reaſon to my firſt reſolution.'</p>
               <p>"He looked as if he could have ſtamped with impatience, at being obliged to ſtifle his rage; but, conquering his anger (for weak people, whoſe paſſions ſeem the moſt ungovernable, reſtrain them with the greateſt eaſe, when they have a ſufficient motive), he exclaimed, 'Very pretty, upon my ſoul! very pretty theatrical flouriſhes! Pray, fair Roxana, ſtoop from your altitudes, and
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:035555_0169_10056215866F4B08"/>
remember that you are acting a part in real life.'</p>
               <p>"He uttered this ſpeech with a ſelf-ſatisfied air, and went down ſtairs to dreſs.</p>
               <p>"In about an hour he came to me again; and in the ſame tone ſaid, 'That he came as my gentleman-uſher, to hand me down to breakfaſt.'</p>
               <p>"'Of the black rod?' aſked I.</p>
               <p>"This queſtion, and the tone in which I aſked it, a little diſconcerted him. To ſay the truth, I now felt no reſentment; my firm reſolution to free myſelf from my ignoble thraldom, had ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbed the various emotions which, during ſix years, had racked my ſoul. The duty pointed out by my principles ſeemed clear; and not one tender feeling intruded to make me ſwerve. The diſlike which my huſband had inſpired was ſtrong; but it only led me to wiſh to avoid, to wiſh to let him drop out of my memory; there was no mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, no torture that I would not deliberately have choſen, rather than renew my leaſe of ſervitude.</p>
               <p>"During the breakfaſt he attempted to reaſon with me on the folly of romantic ſentiments; for
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:035555_0170_10056217AE7CCD78"/>
this was the indiſcriminate epithet he gave to every mode of conduct or thinking ſuperior to his own. He aſſerted, 'that all the world were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by their own intereſt; thoſe who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be actuated by different motives, were only deeper knaves, or fools crazed by books, who took for goſpel all the rodomontade nonſenſe written by men who knew nothing of the world. For his part, he thanked God, he was no hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite; and, if he ſtretched a point ſometimes, it was always with an intention of paying every man his own.</p>
               <p>"He then artfully inſinuated, that he daily expected a veſſel to arrive, a ſucceſsful ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that would make him eaſy for the preſent, and that he had ſeveral other ſchemes actually depending, that could not fail. He had no doubt of becoming rich in a few years, though he had been thrown back by ſome unlucky adventures at the ſetting out.'</p>
               <p>"I mildly replied, 'That I wiſhed he might not involve himſelf ſtill deeper.'</p>
               <p>"He had no notion that I was governed by a deciſion of judgment, not to be compared with a mere ſpurt of reſentment. He knew not what it
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:035555_0171_1005621AACFFA358"/>
was to feel indignation againſt vice, and often boaſted of his placable temper, and readineſs to forgive injuries. True; for he only conſidered the being deceived, as an effort of ſkill he had not guarded againſt; and then, with a cant of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, would obſerve, 'that he did not know how he might himſelf have been tempted to act in the ſame circumſtances.' And, as his heart never opened to friendſhip, it never was wounded by diſappointment.—Every new acquaintance he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted, it is true, was 'the clevereſt fellow in the world;' and he really thought ſo; till the novelty of his converſation or manners ceaſed to have any effect on his ſluggiſh ſpirits. His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for rank or fortune was more permanent, though he chanced to have no deſign of availing himſelf of the influence of either to promote his own views.</p>
               <p>"After a prefatory converſation,—my blood (I thought it had been cooler) fluſhed over my whole countenance as he ſpoke—he alluded to my ſituation. He deſired me to reflect—'and act like a prudent woman, as the beſt proof of my ſuperior underſtanding; for he muſt own I had ſenſe, did I know how to uſe it. I was not,' he laid a ſtreſs on his words, 'without my paſſions; and a huſband was a convenient cloke.—He was
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:035555_0172_1005621CF96200A0"/>
liberal in his way of thinking; and why might not we, like many other married people, who were above vulgar prejudices, tacitly conſent to let each other follow their own inclination?—He meant nothing more, in the letter I made the ground of complaint; and the pleaſure which I ſeemed to take in mr. S.'s company, led him to conclude, that he was not diſagreeable to me.'</p>
               <p>"A clerk brought in the letters of the day, and I, as I often did, while he was diſcuſſing ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of buſineſs, went to the <hi>piano forte,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to play a favourite air to reſtore myſelf, as it were, to nature, and drive the ſophiſticated ſentiments I had juſt been obliged to liſten to, out of my ſoul.</p>
               <p>"They had excited ſenſations ſimilar to thoſe I have felt, in viewing the ſqualid inhabitants of ſome of the lanes and back ſtreets of the metropolis, mortified at being compelled to conſider them as my fellow-creatures, as if an ape had claimed kindred with me. Or, as when ſurrounded by a mephitical fog, I have wiſhed to have a volley of cannon fired, to clear the incumbered atmoſphere, and give me room to breathe and move.</p>
               <p>"My ſpirits were all in arms, and I played a
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:035555_0173_1005621E81BB9698"/>
kind of extemporary prelude. The cadence was probably wild and impaſſioned, while, loſt in thought, I made the ſounds a kind of echo to my train of thinking.</p>
               <p>"Pauſing for a moment, I met mr. Venables' eyes. He was obſerving me with an air of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited ſatisfaction, as much as to ſay—'My laſt inſinuation has done the buſineſs—ſhe begins to know her own intereſt.' Then gathering up his letters, he ſaid, 'That he hoped that he ſhould hear no more romantic ſtuff, well enough in a miſs juſt come from a boarding-ſchool;' and went, as was his cuſtom, to the counting-houſe. I ſtill continued playing; and turning to a ſprightly leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I executed it with uncommon vivacity. I heard footſteps approach the door, and was ſoon convinced that mr. Venables was liſtening—the conſciouſneſs only gave more animation to my fingers. He went down into the kitchen, and the cook, probably by his deſire, came to me, to know what I would pleaſe to order for dinner. Mr. Venables came into the parlour again, with apparent careleſſneſs. I perceived that the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning man was over-reached himſelf—and I gave my directions as uſual, and left the room.</p>
               <p>"While I was making ſome alteration in my
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:035555_0174_1005622108EF0490"/>
dreſs, mr. Venables peeped in, and, begging my pardon for interrupting me, diſappeared. I took up ſome work (I could not read), and two or three meſſages were ſent to me, probably for no other purpoſe, but to enable mr. Venables to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain what I was about.</p>
               <p>"I liſtened whenever I heard the ſtreet door open; at laſt I imagined I could diſtinguiſh mr. Venables' ſtep, going out. I laid aſide my work—my heart palpitated; ſtill I was afraid haſtily to enquire; and I waited a long half hour, before I ventured to aſk the boy whether his maſter was in the counting-houſe?</p>
               <p>"Being anſwered in the negative, I bade him call me a coach, and collecting a few neceſſaries haſtily together, with a little parcel of letters and papers which I had collected the preceding even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I hurried into it, deſiring the coachman to drive to a diſtant part of the town.</p>
               <p>"I almoſt feared that the coach would break down before I got out of the ſtreet; and when I turned the corner, I ſeemed to breathe a freer air. I was ready to imagine that I was riſing above the thick atmoſphere of earth; or I felt, as wearied ſouls might be ſuppoſed to feel, on entering ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtate of exiſtence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="unknown:035555_0175_100562242DBD7CE8"/>
"I ſtopped at one or two ſtands of coaches to elude purſuit, and then drove round the ſhirts of the town to ſeek for an obſcure lodging, where I wiſhed to remain concealed, till I could avail my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of my uncle's protection. I had reſolved to aſſume my own name immediately, and openly to avow my determination, without any formal vindication, the moment I had found a home, in which I could reſt free from the daily alarm of expecting to ſee mr. Venables enter.</p>
               <p>"I looked at ſeveral lodgings; but finding that I could not, without a reference to ſome acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, who might inform my tyrant, get admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance into a decent apartment—men have not all this trouble;—I thought of a woman whom I had aſſiſted to furniſh a little haberdaſher's ſhop, and who I knew had a firſt floor to let.</p>
               <p>"I went to her, and though I could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade her, that the quarrel between me and mr. Venables would never be made up, ſtill ſhe agreed to conceal me for the preſent; yet aſſuring me at the ſame time, ſhaking her head, that, when a woman was once married, ſhe muſt bear every thing. Her pale face, on which appeared a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand haggard lines and delving wrinkles, produced by what is termed fretting, enforced her remark;
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:035555_0176_100562263B4ABDD0"/>
and I had afterwards an opportunity of obſerving the treatment ſhe had to endure, which grizzled her into patience.—She toiled from morning till night; yet her huſband would rob the till, and take away the money reſerved for paying bills; and, returning home drunk, he would beat her if ſhe chanced to offend him, though ſhe had a child at the breaſt.</p>
               <p>"Theſe ſcenes awoke me at night; and, in the morning, I heard her, as uſual, talk to her dear Johnny—he, forſooth, was her maſter; no ſlave in the Weſt-Indies had one more deſpotic—but fortunately ſhe was of the true Ruſſian breed of wives.</p>
               <p>"My mind, during the few paſt days, ſeemed, as it were, diſengaged from my body; but now the ſtruggle was over, I felt very forcibly the effect which perturbation of ſpirit produces on a woman in my ſituation.</p>
               <p>"The apprehenſion of a miſcarriage, obliged me to confine myſelf to my apartment near a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night; but I wrote to my uncle's friend for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, promiſing 'to call on him, and explain my ſituation, when I was well enough to go out—mean time I earneſtly intreated him, not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:035555_0177_10056227C44450D0"/>
my place of abode to any one, leſt my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band—ſuch the law conſidered him—ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb the mind he could not conquer. I mentioned my intention of ſetting out for Liſbon, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment my health would permit.'</p>
               <p>"The tranquility however, which I was reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, was ſoon interrupted. My landlady came up to me one day, with eyes ſwollen with weeping, unable to utter what ſhe was commanded to ſay. She declared, 'That ſhe was never ſo miſerable in her life, that ſhe muſt appear an ungrateful monſter; and that ſhe would readily go down on her knees to me, to intreat me to forgive her, as ſhe had done to her huſband to ſpare her the cruel taſk.' Sobs prevented her from proceeding, or anſwering my impatient inquiries, to know what ſhe meant.</p>
               <p>"When ſhe became a little more compoſed, ſhe took a newſpaper out of her pocket, declaring, 'that her heart ſmote her, but what could ſhe do?—ſhe muſt obey her huſband.'—I ſnatched the paper from her. An advertiſement quickly met my eye, purporting, that 'Maria Venables had, without any aſſignable cauſe, abſconded from her huſband; and any perſon harbouring her, was menaced with the utmoſt ſeverity of the law.'</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="unknown:035555_0178_10056229DAE135D8"/>
"Perfectly acquainted with mr. Venables' meanneſs of ſoul, this ſtep did not excite my ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, and ſcarcely my contempt. Reſentment in my breaſt, never ſurvived love. I bade the poor woman, in a kind tone, wipe her eyes, and requeſt her huſband to come up, and ſpeak to me himſelf.</p>
               <p>"My manner awed him. He reſpected a lady, though not a woman; and began to mutter out an apology.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Venables was a rich gentleman; he wiſhed to oblige me, but he had ſuffered enough by the law already, to tremble at the thought; beſides, for certain, we ſhould come together again, and then even I ſhould not thank him for being acceſſary to keeping us aſunder.—A huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and wife were, God knows, juſt as one,—and all would come round at laſt.' He uttered a drawling 'Hem!' and then with an arch look, added—' Maſter might have had his little frolics—but—Lord bleſs your heart!—men would be men, while the world ſtands.'</p>
               <p>"To argue with this privileged firſt-born of reaſon, I perceived, would be vain. I therefore only requeſted him to let me remain another day at his houſe, while I ſought for a lodging; and
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:035555_0179_1005622C77B24148"/>
not to inform mr. Venables that I had ever been ſheltered there.</p>
               <p>"He conſented, becauſe he had not the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to refuſe a perſon for whom he had an habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual reſpect; but I heard the pent-up choler burſt forth in curſes, when he met his wife, who was waiting impatiently at the foot of the ſtairs, to know what effect my expoſtulations would have on him.</p>
               <p>"Without waſting any time in the fruitleſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence of vexation, I once more ſet out in ſearch of an abode in which I could hide myſelf for a few weeks.</p>
               <p>"Agreeing to pay an exorbitant price, I hired an apartment, without any reference being required relative to my character: indeed a glance at my ſhape ſeemed to ſay, that my motive for conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was obvious. Thus was I obliged to ſhroud my head in infamy.</p>
               <p>"To avoid all danger of detection—I uſe the appropriate word, my child, for I was hunted out like a felon—I determined to take poſſeſſion of my new lodgings that very evening.</p>
               <p>"I did not inform my landlady where I was
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:035555_0180_1005622E933972A0"/>
going. I knew that ſhe had a ſincere affection for me, and would willingly have run any riſk to ſhow her gratitude; yet I was fully convinced that a few kind words from Johnny would have found the woman in her, and her dear benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, as ſhe termed me in an agony of tears, would have been ſacrificed, to recompence her tyrant for condeſcending to treat her like an equal. He could be kind-hearted, as ſhe expreſſed it, when he pleaſed, and this thawed ſternneſs, contraſted with his habitual brutality, was the more accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and could not be purchaſed at too dear a rate.</p>
               <p>"The ſight of the advertiſement made me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of taking refuge with my uncle, let what would be the conſequence; and I repaired in a hackney coach (afraid of meeting ſome perſon who might chance to know me, had I walked) to the chambers of my uncle's friend.</p>
               <p>"He received me with great politeneſs (my uncle had already prepoſſeſſed him in my favour)—and liſtened, with intereſt, to my explanation of the motives which had induced me to fly from home, and ſkulk in obſcurity, with all the timidity of fear that ought only to be the companion of guilt. He lamented, with rather more gallantry
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:035555_0181_1005623019FF4DD0"/>
than, in my ſituation, I thought delicate, that ſuch a woman ſhould be thrown away on a man inſenſible to the charms of beauty or grace. He ſeemed at a loſs what to adviſe me to do, to evade my huſband's ſearch, without haſtening to my uncle, whom, he heſitating ſaid, I might not find alive. He uttered this intelligence with viſible regret; requeſted me, at leaſt, to wait for the arrival of the next packet; offered me what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney I wanted, and promiſed to viſit me.</p>
               <p>"He kept his word; ſtill no letter arrived to put an end to my painful ſtate of ſuſpenſe.—I procured ſome books and muſic, to beguile the tedious ſolitary days.

I ſung—and ſung till, ſaddened by the ſtrain of joy, I bitterly lamented the fate that deprived me of all ſocial pleaſure. Comparative liberty indeed I had poſſeſſed myſelf of; but the jocund train lagged behind.</p>

               <p>"BY watching my only viſitor, my uncle's friend, or by ſome other means, mr. Venables diſcovered my reſidence, and came to enquire for me. The maid-ſervant aſſured him there was no ſuch perſon in the houſe. A buſtle enſued—I caught the alarm—liſtened—diſtinguiſhed his voice, and immediately locked the door. They ſuddenly grew ſtill; and I waited near a quarter of an hour before I heard him open the parlour, and mount the ſtairs with the miſtreſs of the houſe, who obſequiouſly declared that ſhe knew nothing of me.</p>
               <p>"Finding my door locked, ſhe requeſted me to 'open it, and prepare to go home with my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, poor gentleman! to whom I had already occaſioned ſufficient vexation.' I made no reply. Mr. Venables then, in an aſſumed tone of ſoftneſs, intreated me, 'to conſider what he ſuffered, and my own reputation, and get the better of childiſh reſentment.' He ran on in the ſame ſtrain, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:035555_0183_1005623561D6B070"/>
to addreſs me, but evidently adapting his diſcourſe to the capacity of the landlady; who, at every pauſe, uttered an exclamation of pity; or 'Yes, to be ſure—very true, ſir.'</p>
               <p>"Sick of the farce, and perceiving that I could not avoid the hated interview, I opened the door, and he entered. Advancing with eaſy aſſurance to take my hand, I ſhrunk from his touch with an involuntary ſtart, as I ſhould have done from a noiſome reptile, with more diſguſt than terror. His conductreſs was retiring, to give us, as ſhe ſaid, an opportunity to accommodate matters. But I bade her come in, or I would go out; and curioſity compelled her to obey me.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Venables began to expoſtulate; and this woman, proud of his confidence, to ſecond him. But I calmly ſilenced her, in the midſt of a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent harangue, and turning to him, aſked, 'Why he vainly tormented me? declaring that no power on earth ſhould force me back to his houſe.'</p>
               <p>"After a long altercation, the particulars of which it would be to no purpoſe to repeat, he left the room, ſome time was ſpent in loud conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in the parlour below, and I diſcovered that he had brought his friend, an attorney, with him.
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:035555_0184_10056237730CAA20"/>
The tumult on the landing place, brought out a gentleman, who had recently taken apartments in the houſe; he enquired why I was thus aſſailed?<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>The introduction of Darnford as the deliverer of Maria, in an early ſtage of the hiſtory, is already ſtated (Chap. III.) to have been an after-thought of the author. This has probably cauſed the imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the manuſcript in the above paſſage; though, at the ſame time, it muſt be acknowledged to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what uncertain, whether Darnford is the ſtranger intended in this place. It appears from Chap. XVII, that an interference of a more deciſive nature was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to be attributed to him.</hi> EDITOR.</note> The voluble attorney inſtantly repeated the trite tale. The ſtranger returned to me, obſerving, with the moſt ſoothing politeneſs and manly intereſt, 'that my countenance told a very different ſtory.' He added, 'that I ſhould not be inſulted, or forced out of the houſe, by any body.'</p>
               <p>"'Not by her huſband?' aſked the attorney.</p>
               <p>"'No, ſir, not by her huſband.' Mr. Vena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:035555_0185_10056238F8EF3DB8"/>
advanced towards him—But there was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion in his attitude, that ſo well ſeconded that of his voice, They left the houſe: at the ſame time proteſting, that any one that ſhould dare to protect me, ſhould be proſecuted with the utmoſt rigour.</p>
               <p>"They were ſcarcely out of the houſe, when my landlady came up to me again, and begged my pardon in a very different tone.—For, though mr. Venables had bid her, at her peril, harbour me, he had not attended, I found, to her broad hints, to diſcharge the lodging. I inſtantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to pay her, and make her a preſent to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate for my abrupt departure, if ſhe would procure me another lodging, at a ſufficient diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and ſhe, in return, repeating mr. Vena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles' plauſible tale, I raiſed her indignation, and excited her ſympathy, by telling her briefly the truth.</p>
               <p>"She expreſſed her commiſeration with ſuch honeſt warth, that I felt ſoothed; for I have none of that faſtidious ſenſitiveneſs, which a vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar accent or geſture can alarm to the diſregard of real kindneſs.

and the recollection of ſome ridiculous cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic circumſtances, which have occurred in a moment of emotion, has convulſed me with laughter, though at the inſtant I ſhould have thought it ſacrilegious to have ſmiled. Your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, my deareſt girl, being ever preſent to me while I write, I note theſe feelings, becauſe women, more accuſtomed to obſerve manners than actions, are too much alive to ridicule. So much ſo, that their boaſted ſenſibility is often ſtifled by falſe delicacy. True ſenſibility, the ſenſibility which is the auxiliary of virtue, and the ſoul of genius, is in ſociety ſo occupied with the feelings of others, as ſcarcely to regard its own ſenſations. With what reverence have I looked up at my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, the dear parent of my mind! when I have ſeen the ſenſe of his own ſufferings, of mind and body, abſorbed in a deſire to comfort thoſe, whoſe misfortunes were comparatively trivial. He would have been aſhamed of being as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent to himſelf, as he was to others. 'Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine fortitude,' he would aſſert, 'conſiſted in governing our own emotions, and making allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances for the weakneſſes in our friends, that we would not tolerate in ourſelves.' But where is my fond regret leading me!</p>
               <p>"'Women muſt be ſubmiſſive,' ſaid my land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady.
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:035555_0187_1005565446128CD8"/>
'Indeed what could moſt women do? Who had they to maintain them but their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands? Every woman, and eſpecially a lady, could not go through rough and ſmooth, as ſhe had done, to earn a little bread.'</p>
               <p>"She was in a talking mood, and proceeded to inform me how ſhe had been uſed in the world. 'She knew what it was to have a bad huſband, or ſhe did not know who ſhould.' I perceived that ſhe would be very much mortified, were I not to attend to her tale, and I did not attempt to interrupt her, though I wiſhed, as ſoon as poſſible, to go out in ſearch of a new abode for me; where I could once more hide my head.</p>
               <p>"She began by telling me, 'That ſhe had ſaved a little money in ſervice; and was overper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded (we muſt all be in love once in our lives) to marry a likely man, a footman in the family, not worth a groat. My plan' ſhe continued, 'was to take a houſe, and let out lodgings; and all went on well, till my huſband got acquainted with an impudent ſlut, who choſe to live on other people's means, and then all went to rack and ruin. He ran in debt to buy her fine clothes, ſuch clothes as I never thought of wearing myſelf, and—would you believe it?—he ſigned an execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:035555_0188_1005626C398C6C00"/>
on my very goods, bought with the money I worked ſo hard to get; and they came and took my bed from under me, before I heard a word of the matter. Aye, madam, theſe are misfortunes that you gentlefolks know nothing of;—but ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is ſorrow, let it come which way it will.</p>
               <p>"'I ſought for a ſervice again—very hard, after having a houſe of my own, but he uſed to follow me, and kick up ſuch a riot when he was drunk, that I could not keep a place; nay, he even ſtole my clothes, and pawned them; and when I went to the pawnbroker's, and offered to take my oath that they were not bought with a farthing of his money, they ſaid, 'It was all as one, my huſband had a right to whatever I had.'</p>
               <p>"'At laſt he liſted for a ſoldier, and I took a houſe, making an agreement to pay for the furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by degrees, and I almoſt ſtarved myſelf, till I once more got before-hand in the world.</p>
               <p>"'After an abſence of ſix years (God forgive me! I thought he was dead) my huſband return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; found me out, and came with ſuch a penitent face, I forgave him, and clothed him from head to foot. But he had not been a week in the houſe, before ſome of his creditors arreſted him; and,
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:035555_0189_1005626E4E5BC418"/>
he ſelling my goods, I found myſelf once more reduced to beggary; for I was not as well able to work, go to bed late, and riſe early, as when I quitted ſervice; and then I thought it hard enough. He was ſoon tired of me, when there was nothing more to be had, and left me again.</p>
               <p>"'I will not tell you how I was buffeted about, till, hearing for certain that he had died in an hoſpital abroad, I once more returned to my old occupation; but have not yet been able to get my head above water; ſo, madam, you muſt not be angry if I am afraid to run any riſk, when I know ſo well, that women have always the worſt of it, when law is to decide.'</p>
               <p>"After uttering a few more complaints, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on my landlady to go out in queſt of a lodging; and to be more ſecure, I condeſcended to the mean ſhift of changing my name.</p>
               <p>"But why ſhould I dwell on ſimilar incidents!—I was hunted, like an infected beaſt, from three different apartments, and ſhould not have been allowed to reſt in any, had not mr. Venables, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of my uncle's dangerous ſtate of health, been inſpired with the fear of hurrying me out of the world as I advanced in my pregnancy, by
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:035555_0190_1005627092E7EF70"/>
thus tormenting and obliging me to take ſudden journies to avoid him; and then his ſpeculations on my uncle's fortune would prove abortive.</p>
               <p>"One day when he had purſued me to an inn, I fainted, hurrying from him; and, falling down, the ſight of my blood alarmed him, and obtained a reſpite for me. It is ſtrange that he ſhould have retained any hope, after obſerving my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wavering determination; but, from the mildneſs of my behaviour, when I found all my endeavours to change his diſpoſition unavailing, he formed an erroneous opinion of my character, imagining that were we once more together, I ſhould part with the money he could not legally force from me with the ſame facility as formerly. My forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and occaſional ſympathy he had miſtaken for weakneſs of character; and, becauſe he perceived that I diſliked reſiſtance, he thought my indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and compaſſion mere ſelfiſhneſs, and never diſcovered that the fear of being unjuſt, or of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarily wounding the feelings of another, was much more painful to me than any thing I could have to endure myſelf. Perhaps it was pride which made me imagine, that I could bear what I dreaded to inflict; and that it was often eaſier to ſuffer, than to ſee the ſufferings of others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="193" facs="unknown:035555_0191_10056273581632E0"/>
"I forgot to mention that, during this perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, I received a letter from my uncle, inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, 'that he only found relief from continual change of air; and that he intended to return when the ſpring was a little more advanced (it was now the middle of February), and then we would plan a journey to Italy, leaving the fogs and cares of England far behind.' He approved of my conduct, promiſed to adopt my child, and ſeemed to have no doubt of obliging mr. Vena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to hear reaſon. He wrote to his friend, by the ſame poſt, deſiring him to call on mr. Vena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in his name; and, in conſequence of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances he dictated, I was permitted to lie-in tranquilly.</p>
               <p>"The two or three weeks previous I had been allowed to reſt in peace; but ſo accuſtomed was I to purſuit and alarm, that I ſeldom cloſed my eyes without being haunted by mr. Venables' image, who ſeemed to aſſume terrific or hateful forms to torment me, wherever I turned. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a wild cat, a roaring bull, or hideous aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, whom I vainly attempted to fly; at others he was a daemon, hurrying me to the brink of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice, plunging me into dark waves, or horrid gulfs; and I woke, in violent fits of trembling anxiety, to aſſure myſelf that it was all a dream,
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:035555_0192_10056274DD5E1CB8"/>
and to endeavour to lure my waking thoughts to wander to the delightful Italian vales I hoped ſoon to viſit; or to picture ſome auguſt ruins, where I reclined in fancy on a mouldering column, and eſcaped, in the contemplation of the heart-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging virtues of antiquity, from the turmoil of cares that had depreſſed all the daring purpoſes of my ſoul. But I was not long allowed to calm my mind by the exerciſe of my imagination; for the third day after your birth, my child, I was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized by a viſit from my elder brother; who came in the moſt abrupt manner, to inform me of the death of my uncle. He had left the greater part of his fortune to my child, appointing me its guardian; in ſhort, every ſtep was taken to enable me to be miſtreſs of his fortune, without putting any part of it in mr. Venables' power. My bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther came to vent his rage on me, for having, as he expreſſed himſelf, 'deprived him, my uncle's eldeſt nephew, of his inheritance;' though my uncle's property, the fruit of his own exertion, being all in the funds, or on landed ſecurities, there was not a ſhadow of juſtice in the charge.</p>
               <p>"As I ſincerely loved my uncle, this intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence brought on a fever, which I ſtruggled to conquer with all the energy of my mind; for, in my deſolate ſtate, I had it very much at heart to
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:035555_0193_1005627703017478"/>
ſuckle you, my poor babe. You ſeemed my only tie to life, a cherub, to whom I wiſhed to be a father, as well as a mother; and the double duty appeared to me to produce a proportionate increaſe of affection. But the pleaſure I felt, while ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining you, ſnatched from the wreck of hope, was cruelly damped by melancholy reflections on my widowed ſtate—widowed by the death of my uncle. Of mr. Venables I thought not, even when I thought of the felicity of loving your father, and how a mother's pleaſure might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, and her care ſoftened by a huſband's ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs.—'Ought to be!' I exclaimed; and I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to drive away the tenderneſs that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focated me; but my ſpirits were weak, and the unbidden tears would flow. 'Why was I,' I would aſk thee, but though didſt not heed me,—'cut off from the participation of the ſweeteſt pleaſure of life?' I imagined with what extacy, after the pains of child-bed, I ſhould have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented my little ſtranger, whom I had ſo long wiſhed to view, to a reſpectable father, and with what maternal fondneſs I ſhould have preſſed them both to my heart!—Now I kiſſed her with leſs delight, though with the moſt endearing compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, poor helpleſs one! when I perceived a ſlight reſemblance of him, to whom ſhe owed her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence; or, if any geſture reminded me of him,
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:035555_0194_1005627933A4A848"/>
even in his beſt days, my heart heaved, and I preſſed the innocent to my boſom, as if to purify it—yes, I bluſhed to think that its purity had been ſullied, by allowing ſuch a man to be its father.</p>
               <p>"After my recovery, I began to think of tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a houſe in the country, or of making an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſion on the continent, to avoid mr. Venables; and to open my heart to new pleaſures and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The ſpring was melting into ſummer, and you, my little companion, began to ſmile—that ſmile made hope bud out afreſh, aſſuring me the world was not a deſert. Your geſtures were ever preſent to my fancy; and I dwelt on the joy I ſhould feel when you would begin to walk and liſp. Watching your wakening mind, and ſhield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from every rude blaſt my tender bloſſom, I recovered my ſpirits—I dreamed not of the froſt—'the killing froſt,' to which you were deſtined to be expoſed.—But I loſe all patience—and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrate the injuſtice of the world—folly! ignor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance!—I ſhould rather call it; but, ſhut up from a free circulation of thought, and always ponder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the ſame griefs, I writhe under the tortur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apprehenſions, which ought to excite only honeſt indignation or active compaſſion; and would, could I view them as the natural conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence

of things. But, born a woman—and born to ſuffer, in endeavouring to repreſs my own emotions, I feel more acutely the various ills my ſex are fated to bear—I feel that the evils they are ſubject to endure, degrade them ſo far below their oppreſſors, as almoſt to juſtify their tyranny; leading at the ſame time ſuperficial reaſoners to term that weakneſs the cauſe, which is only the conſequence of ſhort-ſighted deſpotiſm.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIV.</head>
               <p>"AS my mind grew calmer, the viſions of Italy again returned with their former glow of colouring; and I reſolved on quitting the kingdom for a time, in ſearch of the chearfulneſs, that naturally reſults from a change of ſcene, unleſs we carry the barbed arrow with us, and only ſee what we feel.</p>
               <p>During the period neceſſary to prepare for a long abſence, I ſent a ſupply to pay my father's debts, and ſettled my brothers in eligible ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but my attention was not wholly engroſſed by my family, though I do not think it neceſſary to enumerate the common exertions of humanity. The manner in which my uncle's property was ſettled, prevented me from making the addition to the fortune of my ſurviving ſiſter, that I could have wiſhed; but I had prevailed on him to bequeath her two thouſand pounds, and ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to marry a lover, to whom ſhe had been ſome time attached. Had it not been for this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, I ſhould have invited her to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany

me in my tour; and I might have eſcaped the pit, ſo artfully dug in my path, when I was the leaſt aware of danger.</p>
               <p>"I had thought of remaining in England, till I weaned my child; but this ſtate of freedom was too peaceful to laſt, and I had ſoon reaſon to wiſh to haſten my departure. A friend of mr. Vena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, the ſame attorney who had accompanied him in ſeveral excurſions to hunt me from my hiding places, waited on me to propoſe a reconciliation. On my refuſal, he indirectly adviſed me to make over to my huſband—for huſband he would term him—the greater part of the property I had at command, menacing me with continual perſecution unleſs I complied; and that, as a laſt reſort, he would claim the child. I did not, though inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midated by the laſt inſinuation, ſcruple to declare, that I would not allow him to ſquander the money left to me for far different purpoſes, but offered him five hundred pounds, if he would ſign a bond not to torment me any more. My maternal anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety made me thus appear to waver from my firſt determination, and probably ſuggeſted to him, or his diabolical agent, the infernal plot, which has ſucceeded but too well.</p>
               <p>"The bond was executed, ſtill I was impatient
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:035555_0198_10056282B9CE1880"/>
to leave England. Miſchief hung in the air when we breathed the ſame; I wanted ſeas to divide us, and waters to roll between, till he had forgotten that I had the means of helping him through a new ſcheme. Diſturbed by the late occurrences, I inſtantly prepared for my departure. My only delay was waiting for a maid ſervant, who ſpoke French fluently, and had been warmly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to me. A valet I was adviſed to hire, when I fixed on my place of reſidence for any time.</p>
               <p>"My God, with what a light heart did I ſet out for Dover!—It was not my country but my cares that I was leaving behind. My heart ſeemed to bound with the wheels, or rather appeared the centre on which they twirled. I claſped you to my boſom, exclaiming, 'And you will be ſafe—quite ſafe—when—we are once on board the packet.—Would we were there.' I ſmiled at my idle fears, as the natural effect of continual alarm; and I ſcarcely owned to myſelf that I dreaded mr. Venables's cunning, or was conſcious of the horrid delight he would feel, at forming ſtratagem after ſtratagem to circumvent me. I was already in the ſnare—I never reached the packet—I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw thee more.—I grew breathleſs. I have ſcarcely patience to write down the details. The maid—the plauſible woman I had hired—put,
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:035555_0199_10056284DA8B5190"/>
doubtleſs ſome ſtupifying potion in what I ate or drank, the morning I left town. All I know is that ſhe muſt have quitted the chaiſe, ſhameleſs wretch! and taken (from my breaſt) my babe with her. How could a creature in a female form ſee me careſs thee, and ſteal thee from my arms! I muſt ſtop, ſtop to repreſs a mother's anguiſh; leſt, in bitterneſs of ſoul, I imprecate the wrath of heaven on this tiger, who tore my only comfort from me.</p>
               <p>"How long I ſlept I know not; certainly many hours, for I woke at the cloſe of day, in a ſtrange confuſion of thought. I was probably rouſed to recollection by ſome one thundering at a huge, unwieldy gate. Attempting to aſk where I was, my voice died away, and I tried to raiſe it in vain, as I have done in a dream. I looked for my babe with affright; feared that it had fallen out of my lap, while I had ſo ſtrangely forgotten her; and, ſuch was the vague intoxication, I can give it no other name, in which I was plunged, I could not recollect when or where I laſt ſaw you; but I ſighed, as if my heart wanted room to clear my head.</p>
               <p>"The gates opened heavily, and the ſullen ſound of many locks and bolts drawn back, grated on my very ſoul, before I was appalled by the
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:035555_0200_1005628662381DD8"/>
creaking of the diſmal hinges, as they cloſed after me. The gloomy pile was before me, half in ruins; ſome of the aged trees of the avenue were cut down, and left to rot where they fell; and as we approached ſome mouldering ſteps, a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous dog darted forwards to the length of his chain, and barked and growled infernally.</p>
               <p>"The door was opened ſlowly, and a murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous viſage peeped out, with a lantern.—'Huſh!' he uttered, in a threatening tone, and the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted animal ſtole back to his kennel. The door of the chaiſe flew back, the ſtranger put down the lantern, and claſped his dreadful arms around me. It was certainly the effect of the ſoporific draught, for, inſtead of exerting my ſtrength, I ſunk without motion, though not without ſenſe, on his ſhoulder, my limbs refuſing to obey my will. I was carried up the ſteps into a cloſe-ſhut hall. A candle flaring in the ſocket, ſcarcely diſperſed the darkneſs, though it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played to me the ferocious countenance of the wretch who held me.</p>
               <p>"He mounted a wide ſtair caſe. Large figures painted on the wall ſeemed to ſtare on me, and glaring eyes to meet me at every turn. Entering a long gallery, a diſmal ſhriek made me ſpring out of my conductor's arms, with I know not
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:035555_0201_1005628898BA69F0"/>
what myſterious emotion of terror; but I fell on the floor, unable to ſuſtain myſelf.</p>
               <p>"A ſtrange-looking female ſtarted out of one of the receſſes, and obſerved me with more curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity than intereſt; till, ſternly bid retire, ſhe flitted back like a ſhadow. Other faces, ſtrongly marked, or diſtorted, peeped through the half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opened doors, and I heard ſome incoherent ſounds. I had no diſtinct idea where I could be—I looked on all ſides, and almoſt doubted whether I was alive or dead.</p>
               <p>"Thrown on a bed, I immediately ſunk into inſenſibility again; and next day gradually reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the uſe of reaſon, I began, ſtarting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted from the conviction, to diſcover where I was confined—I inſiſted on ſeeing the maſter of the manſion—I ſaw him—and perceived that I was buried alive.</p>
               <p>"Such, my child, are the events of thy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's life to this dreadful moment—Should ſhe ever eſcape from the fangs of her enemies, ſhe will add the ſecrets of her priſon-houſe—and—</p>

               <p>THE performance, with a fragment of which the reader has now been preſented, was deſigned to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of three parts.

The faſtidious and cold-hearted critic may perhaps feel himſelf repelled by the incoherent form in which they are preſented.—But an inquiſitive temper wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly accepts the moſt imperfect and mutilated infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, where better is not to be had: and readers, who in any degree reſemble the author in her quick apprehenſion of ſentiment, and of the pleaſures and pains of imagination, will, I believe, find gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in contemplating ſketches, which were deſigned in a ſhort time to have received the finiſhing touches of her genius; but which muſt now for ever remain a mark to record the triumphs of mortality, over ſchemes of uſefulneſs, and projects of public intereſt.</p>

               <p>DARNFORD returned the memoirs to Maria, with a moſt affectionate letter, in which he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned on "the abſurdity of the laws reſpecting matrimony, which, till divorces could be more eaſily obtained, was," he declared, "the moſt inſufferable bondage. Ties of this nature could not bind minds governed by ſuperior principles; and ſuch beings were privileged to act above the dictates of laws they had no voice in framing, if they had ſufficient ſtrength of mind to endure the natural conſequence. In her caſe, to talk of duty was a farce, excepting what was due to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Delicacy, as well as reaſon, forbad her ever to think of returning to her huſband: was ſhe then to reſtrain her charming ſenſibility through mere prejudice? Theſe arguments were not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely impartial, for he diſdained to conceal that, when he appealed to her reaſon, he felt that he had ſome intereſt in her heart.—The conviction was not more tranſporting than ſacred.—a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times a day, he aſked himſelf how he had merited ſuch happineſs?—and as often he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:035555_0204_1005628F24B3D7F0"/>
to purify the heart ſhe deigned to inhabit.—He intreated to be again admitted to her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence."</p>
               <p>He was; and the tear which gliſtened in his eye, when he reſpectfully preſſed her to his boſom, rendered him peculiarly dear to the unfortunate mother. Grief had ſtilled the tranſports of love, only to render their mutual tenderneſs more touching. In former interviews, Darnford had contrived, by a hundred little pretexts, to ſit near her, to take her hand, or to meet her eyes—now it was all ſoothing affection, and eſteem ſeemed to have rivalled love. He adverted to her narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and ſpoke with warmth of the oppreſſion ſhe had endured.—His eyes, glowing with a lambent flame, told her how much he wiſhed to reſtore her to liberty and love; but he kiſſed her hand, as if it had been that of a ſaint; and ſpoke of the loſs of her child, as if it had been his own. What could have been more flattering to Maria?—Every inſtance of ſelf-denial was regiſtered in her heart, and ſhe loved him, for loving her too well to give way to the tranſports of paſſion.</p>
               <p>They met again and again; and Darnford de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, while paſſion ſuffuſed his cheeks, that he never before knew what it was to love.—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="unknown:035555_0205_10056292AD78ABB8"/>
One morning Jemima informed Maria, that her maſter intended to wait on her, and ſpeak to her without witneſſes. He came, and brought a letter with him, pretending that he was ignorant of its contents, though he inſiſted on having it returned to him. It was from the attorney already mentioned, who informed her of the death of her child, and hinted, "that ſhe could not now have a legitimate heir, and that, would ſhe make over the half of her fortune during life, ſhe ſhould be conveyed to Dover, and permitted to purſue her plan of travelling."</p>
               <p>Maria anſwered with warmth, "That ſhe had no terms to make with the murderer of her babe, nor would ſhe purchaſe liberty at the price of her own reſpect."</p>
               <p>She began to expoſtulate with her jailor; but he ſternly bid her "Be ſilent—he had not gone ſo far, not to go further."</p>
               <p>Darnford came in the evening. Jemima was obliged to be abſent, and ſhe, as uſual, locked the door on them, to prevent interruption or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. The lovers were, at firſt, embarraſſed; but fell inſenſibly into confidential diſcourſe. Darnford repreſented, "that they might ſoon be
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:035555_0206_10056294FAE5B2A0"/>
parted," and wiſhed her "to put it out of the power of fate to ſeparate them."</p>
               <p>As her huſband ſhe now received him, and he ſolemnly pledged himſelf as her protector—and eternal friend.—</p>
               <p>There was one peculiarity in Maria's mind: ſhe was more anxious not to deceive, than to guard againſt deception; and had rather truſt without ſufficient reaſon, than be for ever the prey of doubt. Beſides, what are we, when the mind has, from reflection, a certain kind of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which exalts the contemplation above the little concerns of prudence! We ſee what we wiſh, and make a world of our own—and though reality may ſometimes open a door to miſery, yet the moments of happineſs procured by the imagination, may, without a paradox, be reckoned among the ſolid comforts of life.—Maria now, imagining that ſhe had found a being of celeſtial mould—was happy—nor was ſhe deceived.—He was then plaſtic in her impaſſioned hand—and reflected all the ſentiments which animated and warmed her.</p>

               <p>ONE morning confuſion ſeemed to reign in the houſe, and Jemima came in terror, to inform Maria, "that her maſter had left it, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, ſhe was aſſured (and too many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtances corroborated the opinion, to leave a doubt of its truth) of never returning. I am prepared then," ſaid Jemima, "to accompany you in your flight."</p>
               <p>Maria ſtarted up, her eyes darting towards the door, as if afraid that ſome one ſhould faſten it on her for ever.</p>
               <p>Jemima continued, "I have perhaps no right to expect the performance of your promiſe;—but on you it depends to reconcile me with the human race."</p>
               <p>"But, Darnford!"—exclaimed Maria, mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully—ſitting down again, and croſſing her arms—"I have no child to go to, and Liberty has loſt its ſweets."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="210" facs="unknown:035555_0208_100562971C2FB6A8"/>
"I am much miſtaken, if Darnford is not the cauſe of my maſter's ſlight—his keepers aſſure me, that they have promiſed to confine him two days longer, and then he will be free; you cannot ſee him—but they will give a letter to him the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he is free.—In that inform him where he may find you in London; fix on ſome hotel. Give me your clothes; I will ſend them out of the houſe with mine, and we will ſlip out at the garden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate. Write your letter while I make theſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangements, but loſe no time!"</p>
               <p>"In an agitation of ſpirit, not to be calmed, Maria began to write to Darnford. She called him by the ſacred name of "huſband," and bade him "haſten to her, to ſhare her fortune, or ſhe would return to him."—An hotel in the Adel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phi was the place of rendezvous.</p>
               <p>"The letter was ſealed and given in charge; and with light footſteps, yet terrified at the ſound of them, ſhe deſcended, ſcarcely breathing, and with an indiſtinct fear that ſhe ſhould never get out at the garden-gate. Jemima went firſt.</p>
               <p>A being with a viſage that would have ſuited one poſſeſſed by a devil, croſſed the path, and ſeized Maria by the arm. Maria had no fear but
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:035555_0209_1005565C39C14740"/>
of being detained—"Who are you what are? you?" for the form was ſcarcely human. "If you are made of fleſh and blood,"—his ghaſtly eyes glared on her—"do not ſtop me!"</p>
               <p>"Woman," interrupted a ſepulchral voice, "what have I to do with thee?"—Still he graſped her hand, muttering a curſe.</p>
               <p>"No, no; ſhe exclaimed, "this is a moment of life and death!"</p>
               <p>With ſupernatural force ſhe broke from him, and throwing her arms round Jemima, cried, "Save me!" The being, from whoſe graſp ſhe had looſed herſelf, took up a ſtone as they opened the door, and with a kind of helliſh ſport threw it after them. They were out of his reach.</p>
               <p>When Maria arrived in town, ſhe drove to the hotel already fixed on. But ſhe could not ſit ſtill—her child was ever before her; and all that had paſſed during her confinement, appeared to be a dream. She went to the houſe in the ſuburbs, where, as ſhe now diſcovered, her babe had been ſent. The moment ſhe entered, her heart grew ſick; but ſhe wondered not that it had proved its grave. She made the neceſſary enquiries, and
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:035555_0210_1005624033ADF718"/>
the church-yard was pointed out, in which it reſted under a turf. A little frock which the nurſe's child wore (Maria had made it herſelf), caught her eye. The nurſe was glad to ſell it for half-a-guinea, and, re-entering the hackney-coach which waited for her, gazed on it, till ſhe reached her hotel.</p>
               <p>She then waited on the attorney who made her uncle's will, and explained to him her ſituation. He readily advanced her ſome of the money which ſtill remained in his hands, and promiſed to take the whole of the caſe into conſideration. Maria only wiſhed to be permitted to remain in quiet—She found that ſeveral bills, apparently with her ſignature, had been preſented to her agent, nor was ſhe for a moment at a loſs to gueſs by whom they had been forged; yet, equally averſe to threaten or intreat, ſhe requeſted her friend (the ſolicitor) to call on mr. Venables. He was not to be found at home—but at length his agent, the attorney, offered a conditional promiſe to Maria, to leave her in peace, as long as ſhe behaved with propriety, if ſhe would give up the notes. Maria inconſiderately conſented—Darnford was arrived, and ſhe wiſhed to be only alive to love; ſhe wiſhed to forget the anguiſh ſhe felt whenever ſhe thought of her child.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="unknown:035555_0211_10056241B895FE10"/>
They took a ready-furniſhed lodging together, for ſhe was above diſguiſe; Jemima inſiſted on being conſidered as her houſe-keeper, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the coſtomary ſtipend. On no other terms would ſhe remain with her friend.</p>
               <p>Darnford was indefatigable in tracing the myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terious circumſtances of his confinement. The cauſe was ſimply, that a relation, a very diſtant one, to whom he was heir, had died inteſtate, leaving a conſiderable fortune. On the news of Darnford's arrival [in England, a perſon intruſted with the management of the property, and who had the writings in his poſſeſſion, determining, by one bold ſtroke, to ſtrip Darnford of the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion], had planned his confinement; and [as ſoon as he had taken the meaſures he judged moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to his ſubject, this ruffian, together with his inſtrument,] the keeper of the private mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, left the kingdom. Darnford, who ſtill purſued his enquiries, at laſt diſcovered that they had fixed their place of refuge at Paris.</p>
               <p>Maria and he determined therefore, with the faithful Jemima, to viſit that metropolis, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly were preparing for the journey, when they were informed that mr. Venables had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced an action againſt Darnford for ſeduction
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:035555_0212_10056243CB3CADB0"/>
and adultery. The indignation Maria felt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be explained; ſhe repented of the forbearance ſhe had exerciſed in giving up the notes. Darn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford could not put off his journey without riſking the loſs of his property; Maria therefore furniſhed him with money for his expedition; and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to remain in London till the termination of this affair.</p>
               <p>She viſited ſome ladies with whom ſhe had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been intimate, but was refuſed admittance; and at the opera, or Ranelagh, they could not recollect her. Among theſe ladies there were ſome, not her moſt intimate acquaintance, who were generally ſuppoſed to avail themſelves of the cloak of marriage, to conceal a mode of conduct that would for ever have damned their fame, had they been innocent, ſeduced girls. Theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly ſtood aloof.—Had ſhe remained with her huſband, practiſing inſincerity, and neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her child to manage an intrigue, ſhe would ſtill have been viſited and reſpected. If, inſtead of openly living with her lover, ſhe could have condeſcended to call into play a thouſand arts, which, degrading her own mind, might have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the people who were not deceived, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be ſo, ſhe would have been careſſed and treated like an honourable woman.

                     <hi>The name in the manuſcript is by miſtake written Caeſar.</hi> EDITOR.</note> is an honourable man!" ſaid Mark-Antony with equal ſincerity.</p>
               <p>With Darnford ſhe did not taſte uninterrupted felicity; there was a volatility in his manner which often diſtreſſed her; but love gladdened the ſcene; beſides, he was the moſt tender, ſympathiſing creature in the world. A fondneſs for the ſex often gives an appearance of humanity to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of men, who have ſmall pretenſions to the reality; and they ſeem to love others, when they are only purſuing their own gratification. Darnford appeared ever willing to avail himſelf of her taſte and acquirements, while ſhe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to profit by his deciſion of character, and to eradicate ſome of the romantic notions, which had taken root in her mind, while in adverſity ſhe had brooded over viſions of unattainable bliſs.</p>
               <p>The real affections of life, when they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to burſt forth, are buds pregnant with joy and all the ſweet emotions of the ſoul; yet they branch out with wild eaſe, unlike the artificial forms of felicity, ſketched by an imagination pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully alive. The ſubſtantial happineſs, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larges
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:035555_0214_100562487A342198"/>
and civilizes the mind, may be compared to the pleaſure experienced in roving through na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at large, inhaling the ſweet gale natural to the clime; while the reveries of a feveriſh imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation continually ſport themſelves in gardens full of aromatic ſhrubs, which cloy while they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and weaken the ſenſe of pleaſure they gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify. The heaven of fancy, below or beyond the ſtars, in this life, or in thoſe ever-ſmiling regions ſurrounded by the unmarked ocean of futurity, have an inſipid uniformity which palls. Poets have imagined ſcenes of bliſs; but, fencing out ſorrow, all the extatic emotions of the ſoul, and even its grandeur, ſeem to be equally excluded. We doze over the unruffled lake, and long to ſcale the rocks which fence the happy valley of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, though ſerpents hiſs in the pathleſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, and danger lurks in the unexplored wilds. Maria found herſelf more indulgent as ſhe was happier, and diſcovered virtues, in characters ſhe had before diſregarded, while chaſing the phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of elegance and excellence, which ſported in the meteors that exhale in the marſhes of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune. The heart is often ſhut by romance againſt ſocial pleaſure; and, foſtering a ſickly ſenſibility, it grows callous to the ſoft touches of humanity.</p>

                  <pb n="217" facs="unknown:035555_0215_1005624A0370F758"/>
To part with Darnford was indeed cruel.—It was to feel moſt painfully alone; but ſhe rejoiced to think, that ſhe ſhould ſpare him the care and perplexity of the ſuit, and meet him again, all his own. Marriage, as at preſent conſtituted, ſhe conſidered as leading to immortality—yet, as the odium of ſociety impedes uſefulneſs, ſhe wiſhed to avow her affection to Darnford, by becoming his wife according to eſtabliſhed rules; not to be confounded with women who act from very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent motives, though her conduct would be juſt the ſame without the ceremony as with it, and her expectations from him not leſs firm. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſummoned to defend herſelf from a charge which ſhe was determined to plead guilty to, was ſtill galling, as it rouſed bitter reflections on the ſituation of women in <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

               <p>SUCH was her ſtate of mind when the dogs of law were let looſe on her. Maria took the taſk of conducting Darnford's defence upon herſelf. She inſtructed his counſel to plead guilty to the charge of adultery; but to deny that of ſeduction.</p>
               <p>The counſel for the plaintiff opened the cauſe, by obſerving, "that his client had ever been an indulgent huſband, and had borne with ſeveral defects of temper, while he had nothing criminal to lay to the charge of his wife. But that ſhe left his houſe without aſſigning any cauſe.—He could not aſſert that ſhe was then acquainted with the defendant; yet when he was once endeavouring to bring her back to her home, this man put the peace-officers to flight, and took her he knew not whither. After the birth of her child, her conduct was ſo ſtrange, and a melancholy malady having afflicted one of the family, which delicacy forbade the dwelling one, it was neceſſary to confine her. By ſome means the defendant enabled her to make her eſcape, and they had lived together in deſpite
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:035555_0217_1005624EDB76D2A0"/>
of all ſenſe of order and decorum. The adultery was allowed, it was not neceſſary to bring any witneſſes to prove it; but the ſeduction, though highly probable from the circumſtances which he had the honour to ſtate, could not be ſo clearly proved. It was of the moſt atrocious kind, as decency was ſet at defiance, and reſpect for repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which ſhows internal compunction, utterly diſregarded."</p>
               <p>A ſtrong ſenſe of injuſtice had ſilenced every emotion, which a mixture of true and falſe deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy might otherwiſe have excited in Maria's bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom. She only felt in earneſt to inſiſt on the privilege of her nature. The ſarcaſms of ſociety, and the condemnation of a miſtaken world, were nothing to her, compared with acting contrary to thoſe feelings which were the foundation of her principles. [She therefore eagerly put herſelf forward, inſtead of deſiring to be abſent, on this memorable occaſion.]</p>
               <p>Convinced that the ſubterfuges of the law were diſgraceful, ſhe wrote a paper, which ſhe expreſſly deſired might be read in court:</p>
               <p>"Married when ſcarcely able to diſtinguiſh the nature of the engagement, I yet ſubmitted to the
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:035555_0218_10056251015E8660"/>
rigid laws which enſlave women, and obeyed the man whom I could no longer love. Whether the duties of the ſtate are reciprocal, I mean not to diſcuſs; but I can prove repeated infidelities which I overlooked or pardoned.—Witneſſes are not wanting to eſtabliſh theſe facts. I at preſent maintain the child of a maid-ſervant, ſworn to him, and born after our marriage.—I am ready to allow, that education and circumſtances lead men to think and act with leſs delicacy, than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of order in ſociety demands from women; but ſurely I may without preſumption declare, though I could excuſe the birth, I could not the deſertion of this unfortunate babe:—and, while I deſpiſed the man, it was not eaſy to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate the huſband. With proper reſtrictions, however, I revere the inſtitution which fraternizes the world. I exclaim againſt the laws which throw the whole weight of the yoke on the weaker ſhoulders, and force women, when they claim protectorſhip as mothers, to ſign a contract, which renders them dependent on the caprice of the tyrant, whom choice or neceſſity has appointed to reign over them. Various are the caſes, in which a woman ought to ſeparate herſelf from her huſband; and mine, I may be allowed em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically to inſiſt, comes under the deſcription of the moſt aggravated.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="221" facs="unknown:035555_0219_1005625286ADA3F8"/>
"I will not enlarge on thoſe provocations which only the individual can eſtimate; but will bring forward ſuch charges only, the truth of which is an inſult upon humanity. In order to promote certain deſtructive ſpeculations; mr. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nables prevailed on me to borrow certain ſums of a wealthy relation; and, when I refuſed further compliance, he thought of bartering my perſon; and not only allowed opportunities to, but urged, a friend from whom he borrowed money, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce me. On the diſcovery of this act of atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, I determined to leave him, and in the moſt decided manner for ever. I conſider all obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations as made void by his conduct; and hold, that ſchiſms which proceed from want of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, can never be healed.</p>
               <p>"He received a fortune with me to the amount of five thouſand pounds. On the death of my uncle, convinced that I could provide for my child, I deſtroyed the ſettlement of that fortune. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired none of my property to be returned to me, nor ſhall enumerate the ſums extorted from me during ſix years that we lived together.</p>
               <p>"After leaving, what the law conſiders as my home, I was hunted like a criminal from place to place, though I contracted no debts, and demanded
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:035555_0220_100562540D5EB2F0"/>
no maintenance—yet, as the laws ſanction ſuch proceeding, and make women the property of their huſbands, I forbear to animadvert. After the birth of my daughter, and the death of my uncle, who left a very conſiderable property to myſelf and child, I was expoſed to new perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and, becauſe I had, before arriving at what is termed years of diſcretion, pledged my faith, I was treated by the world, as bound for ever to a man whoſe vices were notorious. Yet what are the vices generally known, to the various miſeries that a woman may be ſubject to, which, though deeply felt, eating into the ſoul, elude deſcription, and may be gloſſed over! A falſe morality is even eſtabliſhed, which makes all the virtue of women conſiſt in chaſtity, ſubmiſſion, and the forgiveneſs of injuries.</p>
               <p>"I pardon my oppreſſor—bitterly as I lament the loſs of my child, torn from me in the moſt violent manner. But nature revolts, and my ſoul ſickens at the bare ſuppoſition, that it could ever be a duty to pretend affection, when ſeparation is neceſſary to prevent my feeling hourly averſion.</p>
               <p>"To force me to give my fortune, I was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned—yes; in a private mad-houſe.—There, in the heart of miſery, I met the man charged with
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:035555_0221_100562578AB5E9B0"/>
ſeducing me. We became attached—I deemed, and ever ſhall deem myſelf free. The death of my babe diſſolved the only tie which ſubſiſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and my, what is termed, lawful huſband.</p>
               <p>"To this perſon, thus encountered, I volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily gave myſelf, never conſidering myſelf as any more bound to tranſgreſs the laws of moral purity, becauſe the will of my huſband might be pleaded in my excuſe, than to tranſgreſs thoſe laws to which [the policy of artificial ſociety haſ] annexed [poſitive] puniſhments.—While no command of a huſband can prevent a woman from ſuffering for certain crimes, ſhe muſt be allowed to conſult her conſcience, and regulate her conduct, in ſome degree, by her own ſenſe of right. The reſpect I owe to myſelf, demanded my ſtrict adherence to my determination of never viewing mr. Venables in the light of a huſband, nor could it forbid me from encouraging another. If I am unfortunately united to an unprincipled man, am I for ever to be ſhut out from fulfilling the duties of a wife and mother?—I wiſh my country to approve of my conduct; but, if laws exiſt, made by the ſtrong to oppreſs the weak, I appeal to my own ſenſe of juſtice, and declare that I will not live with the individual, who has violated every moral obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation which binds man to man.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="224" facs="unknown:035555_0222_10056259102A5DE0"/>
"I proteſt equally againſt any charge being brought to criminate the man, whom I conſider as my huſband. I was ſix-and-twenty when I left mr. Venables' roof; if ever I am to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to arrive at an age to direct my own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I muſt by that time have arrived at it.—I acted with deliberation. Mr. Darnford found me a forlorn and oppreſſed woman, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed the protection women in the preſent ſtate of ſociety want.—But the man who now claims me—was he deprived of my ſociety by this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct? The queſtion is an inſult to common ſenſe, conſidering where mr. Darnford met me. Mr. Venables' door was indeed open to me—nay threats and intreaties were uſed to induce me to return; but why? Was affection or honour the motive?—I cannot, it is true, dive into the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of the human heart—yet I preſume to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, [borne out as I am by a variety of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,] that he was merely influenced by the moſt rapacious avarice.</p>
               <p>"I claim then a divorce, and the liberty of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying, free from moleſtation, the fortune left to me by a relation, who was well aware of the character of the man with whom I had to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.—I appeal to the juſtice and humanity of the jury—a body of men, whoſe private judgment
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:035555_0223_1005625B677DB5F0"/>
muſt be allowed to modify laws, that muſt be unjuſt, becauſe definite rules can never apply to indefinite circumſtances—and I deprecate pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment [upon the man of my choice, freeing him, as I ſolemnly do, from the charge of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction.]</p>
               <p>"I did not put myſelf into a ſituation to juſtify a charge of adultery, till I had, from conviction, ſhaken off the fetters which bound me to mr. Venables.—While I lived with him, I defy the voice of calumny to fully what is termed the fair fame of woman. Neglected by my huſband, I never encouraged a lover; and preſerved with ſcrupulous care, what is termed my honour, at the expence of my peace, till he, who ſhould have been its guardian, laid traps to enſnare me. From that moment I believed myſelf, in the fight of heaven, free—and no power on earth ſhall force me to renounce my reſolution."</p>
               <p>The judge, in ſumming up the evidence, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded to "the fallacy of letting women plead their feelings, as an excuſe for the violation of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-vow. For his part, he had always deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to oppoſe all innovation, and the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fangled notions which encroached on the good old rules of conduct. We did not want French prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples

in public or private life—and, if women were allowed to plead their feelings, as an excuſe or palliation of infidelity, it was opening a flood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate for immorality.—What virtuous woman thought of her feelings?—It was her duty to love and obey the man choſen by her parents and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who were qualified by their experience to judge better for her than ſhe could for herſelf. As to the charges brought againſt her huſband, they were vague, ſupported by no witneſſes, excepting that of impriſonment in a private mad-houſe.—The proofs of an inſanity in the family, might render that however a prudent meaſure: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the conduct of the lady did not appear that of a perſon of ſane mind. Still ſuch a mode of proceeding could not be juſtified, and might peahaps entitle the lady [in another court] to a ſentence of ſeparation from bed and board, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the joint-lives of the parties; but he hoped that no Engliſhmen would legalize adultery, by enabling the adultereſs to enrich her ſeducer. Too many reſtrictions could not be thrown in the way of divorces, if we wiſhed to maintain the ſanctity of marriage; and though they might bear a little hard on a few, very few individuals, it was evidently for the good of the whole."</p>

incidents of her life were in arms, embodied to aſſail her, and prevent her ſinking into the ſleep of death.—Her murdered child again appeared to her, mourning for the babe of which ſhe was the tomb.—'And could it have a nobler?—Surely it is better to die with me, than to enter on life without a mother's care!—I cannot live!—but could I have deſerted my child the moment it was born?—thrown it on the troubled wave of life, without a hand to ſupport it?'—She looked up: 'What have I not ſuffered!—may I find a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther where I am going!—Her head turned; a ſtupor enſued; a faintneſs—'Have a little pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,' ſaid Maria, holding her ſwimming head (ſhe thought of her mother), 'this cannot laſt long; and what is a little bodily pain to the pangs I have endured?'</p>
                  <p>A new viſion ſwam before her. Jemima ſeemed to enter—leading a little creature, that, with tottering footſteps, approached the bed.—The voice of Jemima ſounding as at a diſtance, called her; ſhe tried to liſten, to ſpeak, to look!</p>
                  <p>Behold your child!' exclaimed Jemima.—Maria ſtarted off the bed, and fainted.—Violent vomiting followed.</p>

her with great ſolemnity: '—led me to ſuſpect, that your huſband and brother had deceived you, and ſecreted the child. I would not torment you with doubtful hopes, and I left you (at a fatal moment) to ſearch for the child!—I ſnatched her from miſery—and (now ſhe is alive again) would you leave her alone in the world, to endure what I have endured?'</p>
                  <p>Maria gazed wildly at her, her whole frame was convulſed with emotion; when the child, whom Jemima had been tutoring all the journey, uttered the word 'Mamma!' ſhe caught her to her boſom, and burſt into a paſſion of tears—then, reſting the child gently on the bed, as if afraid of killing it,—ſhe put her hand to her eyes, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal as it were the agonizing ſtruggle of her ſoul. She remained ſilent for five minutes, croſſing her arms over her head—then exclaimed: 'The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict is over!—I will live for my child!</p>

                  <p>A few readers perhaps, in looking over theſe hints, will wonder how it could have been prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable, without tediouſneſs, or remitting in any degree the intereſt of the ſtory, to have filled, from theſe ſlight ſketches, a number of pages, more conſiderable than thoſe which have been

already preſented. But, in reality, theſe hints, ſimple as they are, are pregnant with paſſion and diſtreſs. It is the refuge of barren authors only, to crowd their fictions with ſo great a number of events, as to ſuffer no one of them to ſink into the reader's mind. It is the province of true genius to develope events, to diſcover their capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, to aſcertain the different paſſions and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents with which they are fraught, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſify them with incidents, that give reality to the picture, and take a hold upon the mind of a reader to taſte, from which they can never be looſened. It was particularly the deſign of the author, in the preſent inſtance, to make her ſtory ſubordinate to a great moral purpoſe, that "of exhibiting the miſery and oppreſſion, peculiar to women, that ariſe out of the partial laws and cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of ſociety.—This view reſtrained her fancy."<note n="*" place="bottom">

                     </note> It was neceſſary for her, to place in a ſtriking point of view, evils that are too frequently overlooked, and to drag into light thoſe details of oppreſſion, of which the groſſer and more inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible part of mankind make little account.</p>
