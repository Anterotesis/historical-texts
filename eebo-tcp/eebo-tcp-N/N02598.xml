            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>IT will ſeem ſtrange to ſome to meet with a Sermon of mine upon this occaſion. I never could ſee reaſon to think the Sin of the day was a national one, that ſhould oblige us to faſt yearly ſo long a time after it. And the chief pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to which 'tis generally apply'd, were never any encouragement to me to faſt with them, or pay any religious regard to the day.</hi>

               <hi>BUT it happen'd this year to fall on the day of our weekly Lecture, when it was my turn to preach. I thought therefore it would not be improper to ſay ſomewhat in our own vindication, at a time when we were every where inſulted, and abus'd. The Sermon was compos'd and preach'd without the leaſt intention of printing it; but being earneſtly deſir'd by many of the hearers to let it appear in the world, I have given way to their impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.</hi>

                  <hi>As the bird by wandering, as the Swallow by flying; ſo the Curſe cauſeleſs ſhall not come.</hi>

            </epigraph>
            <p>'TIS the cuſtom of his pretended Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, the Man of Sin, once a year to curſe us, among the reſt of thoſe, whom he is pleas'd to count He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retics, in the moſt ſolemn manner, by Bell, Book, and Candle. I wiſh his example was follow'd by none but thoſe of his own Church. But, alas! 'tis ſad to obſerve, how addicted furious and angry men are to love curſing, rather than bleſſing; and with what pleaſure ſome men thunder out their ſevere Cenſures, and bitter imprecations, againſt their innocent neighbours. And did they <hi>ſcatter their fire brands, arrows and death,</hi> only when they were <hi>in ſport,</hi> and over their prophane cups, and in their merry meetings, their impiety would be far leſs than 'tis, when they attempt to ſanctify their malice, by bringing it into their Worſhip, and venting it in the name of GOD himſelf. It has been for a long time the cuſtom of many to <hi>faſt</hi> this day in the year <hi>for ſtrife and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003082_0005_0FEFB83112865710"/>
debate, and to ſmite with the fiſt of wickedneſs.</hi> And we, all of us, are generally repreſented as the vileſt miſcreants, and the abomination of GOD, with a deſign to inflame againſt us the hatred and vengeance of men. And in this caſe, when the foundations of juſtice and charity are over-turn'd, What ſhall the righteous do? Or, where ſhall they ſeek for refuge and comfort, but in the providence of the great GOD, who keeps the ordering all events in his own hand; and who will not intruſt men with an arbitrary diſtribution of all the Curſes, they would be as glad to inflict, as they are to denounce? <hi>Vengeance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to him, and be will recompence,</hi> Heb. 10. 30. And <hi>there is no evil in the city, and the Lord hath not done it,</hi> Amos 3. 6. Neither the raſh judgments, nor the falſe repreſentations, nor the cruel Imprecations and threatnings of angry men ſhall be able to hurt us, if we are ſecure of GOD's favour. A conſcience void of offence will make us eaſy in our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a Bleſſing, when we are ſtunn'd with the loudeſt noiſe of Curſing. For, as <hi>Solomon</hi> aſſerts in the Text, <hi>The Curſe cauſeleſs ſhall not come.</hi> 'Tis upon this clauſe of the <hi>Verſe</hi> I intend to inſiſt, for our encouragement and comfort on the preſent occaſion. But the connexion of it with the former part of the <hi>Verſe</hi> being obſcure, and the latter clauſe hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome ambiguity in it; I think it will be neceſſary to give ſome account, in the firſt place, of the general meaning of the words.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:003082_0006_0FEFB858A8104960"/>
IN the <hi>Hebrew</hi> there is often a difference between the Text and the Margin, the <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </hi> and the <hi>Keri:</hi> and Tranſlators take the liberty of following ſometimes the one, and ſometimes the other: and 'tis often hard to judge which is beſt, the <hi>Jews</hi> pretending both to be owing to the inſpir'd Writers. Thus it is in the laſt clauſe of the Text, which, according to one reading of the Original, may be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd thus: <hi>So is the Curſe cauſeleſs, it ſhall not come.</hi> And according to the other reading, thus: <hi>So is the Curſe cauſeleſs, it ſhall come upon him;</hi> that is, upon the perſon, who without cauſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces it. Now the meaning of the former clauſe of the <hi>Verſe</hi> will be different according as we fix upon the one, or t'other reading of the latter. If we read it: <hi>As the bird by wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, as the Swallow by flying; ſo is the Curſe cauſeleſs, it ſhall not come:</hi> the ſenſe will be this: That the Curſe cauſeleſs is a wild and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thing, as much at random, as the flying of a bird; that it as eaſily flies over our heads without doing us any hurt, as a bird does; or, that it is as eaſily avoided by us, as a ſnare is by a bird that is upon the wing. But if we take the other reading of the words: <hi>As the bird by wandering, as the Swallow by flying, ſo is the Curſe cauſeleſs, it ſhall come upon him:</hi> the meaning will be: That as a bird by wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expoſes itſelf to danger, ſo does a man by cauſeleſs curſing of his neighbour, the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief falls upon himſelf. And we may obſerve, the wiſe man repreſents elſewhere the neſt, as
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003082_0007_0FEFB834B34ED788"/>
a place of ſafety for a bird; and ſpeaks of it as expos'd to danger, by leaving <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from its neſt: <hi>As a bird that wan<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>eth from her neſt; ſo is a man that wandereth from his place</hi> Prov. 26. 8. Either of theſe ſenſes is moſt juſt and true, and we need not to be ſolicitous which to prefer. I confeſs the latter ſeems to me more agreeable to <hi>Solomon</hi>'s uſe of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon here mention'd. But then that ſenſe implies the other. For if the curſe falls upon him, who denounces it; then it does not upon him, againſt whom 'tis denounc'd.</p>
            <p>IN ſpeaking therefore to the Text, I ſhall,</p>
            <p>I. INQUIRE, When a Curſe may be ſaid to be cauſeleſs?</p>
            <p>II. I SHALL ſhew you, That the Curſe, with which we are ordinarily loaded on this day, is cauſeleſs.</p>
            <p>III. I SHALL endeavour to ſet before you the comfort, which the Text holds forth to you; that this cauſeleſs Curſe ſhall be miſchievous, not to them who are curſed, but to the Curſers themſelves.</p>
            <p>I. I SHALL inquire, When a Curſe may be ſaid to be cauſeleſs? Now there are four caſes, wherein a curſe may be cauſeleſs.</p>
            <p n="1">I. WHEN the pretended ground, or reaſon of the Curſe, is ſomething really good and juſt;
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003082_0008_0FEFB85D45F27218"/>
or, however harmleſs and innocent, and ſo there is no occaſion for any curſing at all. The Curſe cauſeleſs is the Curſe, which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerv'd; and certainly nothing can be more undeſerv'd than a Curſe, when a man's actions are ſuch as merit commendation and praiſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE Curſe is cauſeleſs, when tho' the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of it is evil, yet the evil is too incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable to deſerve ſuch a Curſe, as is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd upon the account of it. There are degrees of evil, as well as good; and 'tis not a man's being ſure there is evil in any action, that will juſtify him in paſſing the moſt ſevere and rigorous ſentence upon him who is guilty of it. A Father, a Maſter, or a Magiſtrate would be very unjuſt, if he ſhould puniſh every offence with equal ſeverity. A proportion is always to be obſerv'd, and men are to be dealt with ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or mildly, according to the nature of the crime they have committed. And ſo far as the doom, or Curſe men pronounce, exceeds the deſert of the offence, ſo far is it without doubt cauſeleſs. Beſides, the law of charity ſhould teach us to make all the allowances we can, for thoſe circumſtances, which may alleviate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons guilt. Our common infirmities may, one would think, incline us to follow this rule. We often need ourſelves thoſe charitable conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which our neighbours expect we ſhould put upon their actions. And it would be hard and cauſeleſs to curſe a perſon, as doing that wilfully and maliciouſly, which he did thro' miſtake or inadvertence. This indeed can't be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003082_0009_0FEFB8366520AB50"/>
in caſes plainly and groſſly evil, where every man's conſcience muſt needs inform him: but without all queſtion, great regard ſhould be had to ſuch circumſtances in all intricate and diſputable matters, wherein good men have been found to take both ſides of the queſtion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE Curſe is cauſeleſs, when the perſon againſt whom 'tis levell'd is innocent, and had no hand in the occaſion of it, however grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly evil and wicked it was. For in this caſe, tho' the Curſe may be deſerv'd; yet 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, 'tis not by him who is curſed. And men ſhould be as careful to acquit the innocent, as they are to condemn the guilty.</p>
            <p n="4">4. THEN is the Curſe cauſeleſs, when the perſon who denounces it, is equally guilty with him, whom he curſes, For whatever the crime is, yet he muſt with a very ill grace curſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for it, who has himſelf an equal ſhare in the guilt. And he that curſes another, for what he does himſelf, virtually curſes himſelf. <hi>Therefore thou art inexcuſable, O man, whoſoever thou art that judgeſt: for wherein thou judgeſt another thou condemneſt thyſelf; for thou that judgeſt, doſt the ſame things.</hi> Rom. 2. 1, 2. And tho' the Curſe may not in this caſe be cauſeleſs in it ſelf; yet it manifeſtly is ſo in the perſon, from whom it proceeds.</p>
            <p>I SUPPOSE there can be no difficulty in perceiving the Curſe is cauſeleſs in theſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral caſes. I proceed therefore to the next part of my Diſcourſe,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:003082_0010_0FEFB85FB0EA00D0"/>
II. TO ſhew, that the Curſe with which we are ordinarily loaded on this day is cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; and that our Adverſaries have no reaſon to abuſe, revile, and condemn us at the rate they do, upon this occaſion: And here I need only conſider, how applicable thoſe ſeveral things already mention'd, which ſhew a Curſe to be cauſeleſs, are to our caſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Great part of the matter of our charge, and the reaſon why we have ſuch a heavy doom paſt upon us, is ſo far from being cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, that it is truly noble, and deſerves much praiſe and commendation. I ſpeak now only of what was done by the Parliament, and thoſe who joyn'd with them againſt the King, or rather againſt his evil Counſellors. As to what follow'd, when ſeveral of the Members were ſecluded, and a few only were ſuffer'd to be preſent, and give their Vote; I ſhall never reckon that to be the Parliament's Act. But a great load is thrown upon us, for what was the Act of the Parliament, and all the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of that unhappy time are ordinarily laid at our door: But the troubles were really ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thoſe, who put the King upon invading the rights of his Subjects; and that brave Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament is worthy of an honourable and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting remembrance, who ſtood up nobly in the defence of them. All the world muſt own, it properly belong'd to the Parliament to take notice of, and redreſs ſuch grievances, as the Nation then groan'd under. They are the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

and bulwark of our civil Liberties, againſt the incroachments of an arbitrary Power. The wiſdom of our anceſtors had provided, that Parliaments ſhould have an opportunity of look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into, and redreſſing the Nation's grievances, by reſerving to them the Power of ſupplying the Prince with money. And when there was no ſuch Law, as has been ſince made, for the frequent meeting of thoſe Aſſemblies; there was no other way to ſecure to the Nation their Privileges, but by a ſtiff defence of their right to refuſe to part with their money, unleſs it was given in a Parliamentary way. 'Twas this began thoſe troubles, and all the world muſt juſtify that Parliament, for ſtanding up in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the right of the Subjects; and taking the opportunity to redreſs the miſchiefs, which were owing to as corrupt and vile a Miniſtry, as ever had before haraſs'd the Nation. And doubtleſs, while the Parliament ſtood up in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Subjects Liberties, it was the duty of the Subjects to ſtand by them and defend them. And to that noble Stand, that was then made in the days of our Forefathers, we are indebted, that we their Poſterity are not a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Slaves to the Arbitrary Power of our Kings, and the luſts of ſuch a vicious, fawning Clergy, as then carry'd all before them.</p>
            <p n="2"> 2. SUPPOSING the proceedings of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and the Nation (for I as yet meddle with no more) were in ſome reſpects evil and unjuſtifiable; yet were there ſuch circumſtances
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003082_0012_0FEFB8632200FC90"/>
in their caſe, as muſt be allow'd to go a great way in excuſing them, and ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lighten the cenſure men paſs upon them. 'Tis indeed very hard for the beſt of men to manage a long quarrel, that riſes to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable height, without deſerving ſome blame. Tho' we allow, there were ſome things amiſs in the conduct of thoſe, who ſtood up for the Liberties of the People; yet every one muſt ſee, their end and deſign was very good, and that the methods they took were generally ſo too. And this will go a great way in excuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, even when it will not wholly juſtify. If their Jealouſies and ſuſpicions ran too high, and if the terms they ſtood upon ſeem to have been ſometimes a little extravagent, let their circumſtances be conſider'd. They had ſeen what advances had been made to ſet up Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, both in Church and State; they had the Maſſacre of 200,000 of their Brethren in <hi>Ireland</hi> before their eyes, and the threatnings of the like uſage were loud in their ears. And in ſuch a caſe, who can blame them, if they inſiſted upon an extraordinary ſecurity? If their ſuſpicions were beyond the true deſigns of thoſe they had to deal with, they may thank themſelves who gave them too much reaſon to entertain them. Our Senators could not have been faithful in the truſt their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try had lodg'd in them, if they had not done their utmoſt to ſecure the ſafety of the Nation. And if it was a fault, 'twas certainly a very pardonable one, that they thought it much better to lay a reſtraint upon the Power of the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:003082_0013_0FEFB83B4AE6E4C0"/>
Prince, than to hazard the utter ruin and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Community. And therefore, as to what was a national act, that is, what was then done by a free Parliament at that time, poſterity ſhould, and I doubt not in a little time will, judge more calmly and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially concerning it; and not load as brave a ſet of men, as ever the Nation had, with their cenſures, for a conduct, which derives ſo many advantages and benefits to their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors.</p>
            <p n="3">3. 'TIS moſt evident, the Curſe which is uſually on this day denounc'd againſt us, is cauſeleſs; becauſe we are perfectly innocent, and had no manner of hand in the pretended occaſion of their curſing us. Let the tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the day be as black and horrid as they pleaſe to repreſent it, what is that to us? What reaſon have they to raiſe ſuch an out-cry againſt us upon that account? 'Tis now ſixty-eight years ago ſince the thing was done; and 'tis a queſtion whether there be any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon left in the Nation, who had directly, or indirectly, the leaſt hand in the King's death? Is it not then cauſeleſs, for them to run out with ſo much intemperance and extravagance in curſing us, for a matter of which we are wholly innocent, and which was tranſacted, if not before we were born, yet at leaſt before we were capable of having any hand in it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> I. BUT ſay they; If you had no hand in it, your fathers had, and the Curſe is due to you for your fathers ſins.</p>

               <hi>Ans.</hi> THE putting the King to death was the act of a very few; and the families who can in this reſpect be concern'd in it cannot be many. The act was far from being national, but was commited by a <hi>Juncto</hi> of men, who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd the nation, and inſlav'd the Parliament. And tho' they don't care to own it, yet they know very well, that the Leaders of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the<note place="bottom">
                  <hi>See</hi> Vindication of the Miniſters of the Goſpel in and about <hi>London,</hi> 1648.</note> Miniſters at that time, earneſtly, and with the hazard of their all in this world, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proteſted againſt the fact, to the very face of them who did it. One would think, they who pretend to embalm the memory of that King, ſhould treat thoſe, who appear'd his friends at that time, with ſomewhat more of decency. If they were not able to ſave the King from death, yet they ſhew'd their good-will to do it; and when they could do no more, thro' the domineering power of a few, they heartily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted againſt it, when we could tell them, who ſtood by without ſpeaking a word in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. HOWEVER, ſay they, tho' you had not a perſonal hand in that fact, your principles are the ſame with theirs who had, you are all of you for deſtroying Kings, and will gladly do it upon every opportunity, and therefore we juſtly charge you with the wickedneſs, and curſe you for it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:003082_0015_0FEFB84014517E08"/>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 'TIS very much, I confeſs, we ſhould have ſuch had principles as they charge us with, and not know it: and that they ſhould be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able to tell us what our principles are, than we can tell ourſelves. Tho' ſuch bold aſſertions may delude their eaſy followers, who receive them with an implicit faith; yet certainly it muſt be very hard for them to convince us, or indeed, any indifferent perſons, that we don't know our own principles. If the law of the land has eſtabliſh'd them as a Church; yet I ſuppoſe neither that, nor the law of GOD, has eſtabliſh'd 'em as Inquiſitors and ſearchers of mens hearts. This pretence of the badneſs of our principles, with reſpect to civil Government, has been artfully play'd againſt us. Our Schools have been repreſented as dangerous, and not to be allow'd. And who can doubt they muſt be ſo, if what they ſay be true? For why may not a man as well be ſuppos'd to teach, as to hold, baſe principles, without knowing any thing of the matter? But if theſe Inquiſitors will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to us ſo far, as to give us leave to know our own principles, allow us to be able to give a more faithful account of them, than they can do for us; we do not doubt to juſtify our principles againſt all the ſenſeleſs clamours of thoſe who would run us down.</p>
            <p>WE think it then our duty to live peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and quietly under that Government, which the providence of GOD, and the laws of the land have ſet over us: that we are bound to
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003082_0016_0FEFB8674910B590"/>
be ſubject to it, and according to our ſtations to maintain it, ſo long as it anſwers its true end, without troubling ourſelves about the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular form of it. If we don't believe the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alienable indefeaſible Right, or the <hi>jus divinum</hi> of Kings, and an arbitrary Government, they may thank themſelves for it; ſince they never produce any ſufficient Charter for it, while they pretend to have one. In ſhort, we diſtinguiſh between Kings and Tyrants; thoſe who make the good of their people, and thoſe who make their own pleaſure, the rule of their admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration. The former we think ourſelves bound in conſcience to obey; and the latter we ſhould think we were great fools, if we did not to our power withſtand and reſiſt. Such are our principles, that no good King need, or ever did, diſtruſt us: and we count it not a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to us; that bad ones are always jealous of us; and we wiſh our Adverſaries did not, by endeavouring alway to improve the jealouſy of ſuch, convince the world they are the only ones for their turn. If we don't complement our Princes with the promiſe of obedience without reſerve; yet we think ourſelves bound to be ſubject to them in all civil things, while they make the Laws of the land their ſtandard. And as to our conſciences in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous matters, we proteſt 'tis, and hope it ever will be our principle, to keep them ſacred to the direction of a higher and greater Prince, who alone has a right to preſcribe to them. And he muſt be a bad Prince with a witneſs, who will not be content with our rendring
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:003082_0017_0FEFB841A7663A38"/>
to him the things that are his; or, who will not allow us to render unto GOD the things that are GOD's.</p>
            <p>AS to kingly Government in particular, we are unreaſonably charg'd to be enemies to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. Men may fancy one Government to be more perfect than another, and the world has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been divided in their ſpeculations upon that head; but I believe we are all in general pleas'd with, and thankful to GOD for, ſuch a Monarchy as ours, which is ſo limitted by the Laws. So that we are perfectly innocent i<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the matter, for which our adverſaries are ſo very free in curſing of us.</p>
            <p n="4">4. THE Curſe which they denounce againſt us is cauſeleſs, ſince they who denounce it, are themſelves the moſt guilty. I don't now run back to tranſactions, wherein neither we, nor they had any hand. I conſider what is freſh in all our memories. Rebellion is the pretended occaſion of the charge brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, and the High Generation are the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagers of it, who take upon them very ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to read our doom. But have they not now for ever ſtop'd their own mouths? Will they blame us for ſtanding up for our Liberties, when we had the Parliament, one part of the Legiſlature, on our ſide; and yet think themſelves innocent in inviting over the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> to reſcue their Liberties, when they acted on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a private capacity? If the rights of Kings are ſo unalienable, if their perſons are ſo ſacred,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:003082_0018_0FEFB86B7A9FFAF8"/>
that they can never be reſifted, but upon pain of that damnation which they thunder out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us on this occaſion; What muſt become of them, who invited a Prince to drive away K.<hi>James,</hi> and join'd with him afterward in wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a war to keep him out? According to their notions, there was not a ſword drawn, or a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol fir'd againſt K.<hi>James</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but what was a lifting up the hand againſt the Lord's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed, and as truly a conſpiring his death, as any thing they were ever guilty of who actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put his Father to death.</p>
            <p>BUT to come yet nearer: Who were they that hatch'd the late Rebellion, that took up arms againſt the beſt of Kings, and that fought in the open field againſt him? Were any of thoſe, they have been ſo long curſing as enemies to kingly Government, and as Rebels againſt all Kings; were any of thoſe their aſſociates? Who were the Generals, the Soldiers, or the Chaplains, in the rebellious Hoſt? They cannot pretend that his Majeſty, King <hi>GEORGE,</hi> had no right to the Crown; we have their oaths to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: and if we may not believe 'em when they are upon their oaths, I can't ſee why we ſhould much regard what they ſay at any other time.</p>
            <p>WHEN therefore theſe men, according to their uſual Cant, reproach you with Sedition and Rebellion; requeſt them, that they would pleaſe to explain themſelves, Whether they mean, thoſe of <hi>Oxford, Mancheſter, Birmingham, Briſtol,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places they have made too many to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd?
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:003082_0019_0FEFB8435CD126C8"/>
Or, Whether they mean thoſe of <hi>Preſton</hi> and <hi>Dumblain?</hi> Deſire them to oblige you with the names of the <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> Miniſters, Juſtices, Generals, Captains, and other Officers; the <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi> Soldiers, or Mobs, that appear'd or acted upon any of theſe Occaſions. They will ſoon be weary, if they attempt to give you the characters of the actors in that villany; unleſs they will deny it to be ſuch, becauſe 'tis ſanctify'd by the Church, for whoſe ſake they pretend it was deſign'd.</p>
            <p>IF, according to their uſual cuſtom, they twit you with 1641, without aſking them, Whether they mean the murdering 200,000 Proteſtants by their good friends in <hi>Ireland?</hi> you may tell them, You need not be at the trouble of going half ſo far back as 1641, to meet with 1715, or 1688; and that the Church of <hi>England</hi> has in theſe two latter, more than equal'd all that the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> did in the former.</p>
            <p>SINCE then theſe very men are ſo notoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guilty of that crime, for which they pretend to condemn us: the curſing us muſt needs be cauſeleſs as to them, if we had actually deſerv'd it; as I have ſhewn you we have not. And they, of all men in the world, have the leaſt reaſon to make ſuch an out-cry as they do, with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous <hi>Athaliah: Treaſon, treaſon,</hi> 2 Kings 11. 14. But 'tis time for me to haſten to the laſt general Head of my Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>III. AND I hope I have now by ſhewing you, that the Curſe againſt you is cauſeleſs, prepar'd
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:003082_0020_0FEFB86DF5A1B898"/>
you to receive the comfort which the Text may afford you: which is according to the different readings, either, <hi>it ſhall not come;</hi> or <hi>it ſhall come upon him</hi> that denounces it, and be moſt miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to himſelf. There is ſo much of reaſon and truth in either reading, that 'tis hard to tell which is to be preferr'd, and therefore I ſhall briefly ſpeak to both.</p>
            <p>I. THE Curſe cauſeleſs ſhall not come upon the perſons, at whom it is levell'd. And if this be true, and we are ſure we are innocent, we need not much diſtreſs ourſelves, whatever the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is we meet with at the hands of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. They may revile and abuſe us, and ſay all manner of evil falſely againſt us; but this ſhall not really turn to our prejudice. And to evidence this, conſider,</p>
            <p>(I.) THAT GOD has not left it in the power of ſuch perſons to execute their ſentences, they are pleas'd to paſs upon others; or, the deſigns and purpoſes they have laid againſt them. They are often ready to flatter themſelves into an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of their own power, and to be confident of the ſucceſs of their own projects; that they ſhall be able to wreck their malice upon their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and to make them as miſerable, as they would wiſh them to be. But, as they are not bleſs'd, whom they bleſs; ſo, neither are they curs'd, whom they curſe. There is a ſupreme LORD over them, and an their deſigns, who will not ſuffer them to proceed according to their hearts luſt, but directs all with a different view.
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:003082_0021_0FEFB847DF088CB0"/>
He makes <hi>the wrath of men to praiſe him,</hi> Pſal. 76. 10. and whatever is over and above that, <hi>be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains.</hi> He diſappoints ſuch, when they ſeem to think themſelves neareſt to the execution of their purpoſes, and when they are moſt confident of cruſhing the objects of their hatred and ſpite. Thus it has been ſeen of old, and thus have we ſeen in the city of our GOD. Let it be record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the generations to come, that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, and praiſe, and truſt in the LORD.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) As they have not in their power, to make whom they pleaſe curſed; ſo neither does a holy and righteous GOD regard their Curſe, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it. GOD is indeed a GOD of recompences; but where the Curſe is cauſeleſs, and undeſerved, his Juſtice no way obliges him to fulfil it. If the Curſe cauſeleſs takes effect, it muſt be thro' the power of thoſe from whom it proceeds, which we ſee it cannot; or elſe thro' the vengeance of GOD, in anſwer to their deſires. But there can be no reaſon to be afraid upon any ſuch account. GOD hears not ſinners; and he who has made love, charity, and forgiveneſs, ſo eſſential to true religion, cannot be thought to be pleaſed with the wrath, malice, and cruelty of angry men, or to delight to execute all their raſh and haſty judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. We need not therefore diſtreſs ourſelves, when we know that profane men curſe us, or wiſh our confuſion in their cups; no, not when 'tis done with more gravity and ſolemnity, and religion it ſelf is proſtituted, to ſet off envy and malice to the greater advantage. GOD is too much diſpleaſed with a cenſorious, damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:003082_0022_0FEFB87087517960"/>
humour, ever to do any thing to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy it.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) 'TIS a ſure evidence that the Curſe cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſhall not come, ſince a good GOD has, by his promiſe, ſecur'd us a Bleſſing inſtead of it. GOD is the patron of the innocent and oppreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and the more any are abus'd and run down wrongfully, the greater is his compaſſion and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour toward them. GOD will not have fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the workers of iniquity, nor take part with them in their ſpite, ſo far is he from this, that he has made this very treatment an argument of their bleſſedneſs. <hi>Bleſſed are ye,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>when men ſhall revile you, and perſecute you, and ſay all manner of evil againſt you falſely for my ſake. Rejoice and be exceeding glad; for great is your reward in heaven: for ſo perſecuted they the Prophets which were before you.</hi> The beſt of men, who have gone before us, have met with the like uſage. Nay, which is much greater, the Son of GOD himſelf was thus treated. He, as well as his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, was traduced as a ſeditious perſon, and uſed with the utmoſt ſpite and malignity. But thoſe who were curſed of men, were reckon'd by GOD to be bleſſed, and actually were bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in his favour. And GOD's favour and love is a ſecurity of bleſſedneſs to his people, in ſpite of all the ill-will and malevolent deſigns of their enemies. Obſerve how GOD ſpeaks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the enemies of his people: <hi>They hired</hi> Balaam, <hi>the ſon of</hi> Beor <hi>of</hi> Pethor <hi>of</hi> Meſopota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia, <hi>to curſe thee. Nevertheleſs the Lord thy God would not hearken unto</hi> Balaam: <hi>but the Lord thy</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:003082_0023_0FEFB84A63344C70"/>
               <hi>God turned the Curſe into a bleſſing, becauſe the Lord thy God loved thee.</hi> Deut. 28. 4, 5. GOD made the wretch, that intended a Curſe, to pronounce a Bleſſing; and the more forward men were <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> curſe them, the more inclined GOD was to bleſs them. And the very Curſe of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is ſometimes a Bleſſing and an advantage. For when their wickedneſs is brought to light, and has render'd them odious and abominable; 'tis natural for men to apprehend, there muſt be a more than ordinary goodneſs in thoſe who are the objects of ſuch mens greateſt hatred and the moſt angry of our adverſaries, I hope will not be diſpleas'd with us, if we obſerve and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the ſteps of divine providence, in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, toward ourſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE Curſe cauſeleſs, according to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reading, ſhall come upon him; that is, ſhall recoil upon the Author. The greateſt miſchief it does, is to him, out of whoſe mouth it proceeds.</p>
            <p>AND this cannot be thought ſtrange, ſince the Curſe cauſeleſs is a palpable wickedneſs. And who is moſt hurt by any wickedneſs, but the perſon who commits it? <hi>He that ſins againſt God wrongs his own ſoul.</hi> Prov. 8. 36. By this, as well as all other wickedneſs, men provoke the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Almighty; and that is, of all others, the moſt dreadful curſe. And I may further add, that this is a very aggravated wickedneſs, and therefore may the rather be ſuppoſed likely to fall heavy upon them, who are guilty of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:003082_0024_0FEFB8720BC221C0"/>
THE thing is not only contrary to a goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel temper, and a true chriſtian ſpirit; but is likewiſe a moſt daring invaſion of the prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of the heavenly King; which muſt be moſt notorious in thoſe, who pretend, above all men, to be tender of and zealous for, the prerogative of earthly Kings. Raſh and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious judging, is a bold aſpiring to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of ſearching the hearts of men: and Chriſt has warn'd men, what to expect in this <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

So that our Saviour himſelf has determin'd the caſe, that the Curſe cauſeleſs, the harſh and cruel ſentences men paſs upon their neighbours, ſhall be executed upon themſelves.</p>
            <p>AND this is further an invading GOD's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, in as much as 'tis a taking vengeance out of GOD's hand into mens own. <hi>Vengeance is mine, faith the Lord, and I will recompence.</hi> Heb. 10. 30.

            <p>AND certainly the conduct of divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has been very admirable in our time; we have ſeen the men, who were ſo zealous in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting the doctrines of Paſſive Obedience and Non-reſiſtance, and in damning ſuch as oppos'd them; we have lived, I ſay, to ſee them forc'd to renounce both the principle and practice, and take up arms in defence of their Liberties, when they were themſelves attack'd. And for their acting thus at the Revolution, if the thing be conſider'd abſtractly from their before avow'd principles, I am far from blaming them. But if there was any edge in the ſevere ſentences they us'd to paſs, 'tis evident from that time it became turn'd againſt themſelves. We have ſeen the men, who doom'd us as Rebels to diſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this world, and the pit of hell in the world to come; them, I ſay, even them, have we ſeen left, by a juſt and righteous GOD, to act the Rebels in the open field, againſt a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which had never given them the leaſt cauſe of complaint; and which they themſelvs, in the ſolemneſt manner, had teſtify'd to be rightful and juſt.</p>

AND now, what ſhall we ſay, but that the Curſe cauſeleſs is come upon the Curſer? <hi>Behold be travaileth with iniquity, and bath conceiv'd miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, and brought forth falſehood. He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallon into the ditch which he made. His miſchief ſhall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing ſhall come down upon his own pate.</hi> Pſal. 7. 14. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I Have but a few things to add briefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our Duty on this occaſion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. WHEN we obſerve this conduct of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, it ſhould excite our praiſe and thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving. So the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> upon his having men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd the wicked falling in the miſchief they intended for others, in the <hi>Pſalm</hi> juſt now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to, immediately adds: <hi>I will praiſe the Lord according to his righteouſneſs,</hi> (there is a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in the procedure, that well deſerves to be the ſubject of our praiſe) <hi>and will ſing praiſe unto the Name of the Lord moſt high.</hi> When the <hi>enemy ſaid, I will purſue, I will overtake, I will divide the ſpoil, my luſt ſhall be ſatiſfied upon them, I will draw my ſword, my hand ſhall deſtroy them;</hi> but GOD <hi>blew upon them with his wind,</hi> Exod. 15. 9, 10, 11. and confounded them: then <hi>Moſes</hi> and the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> celebrated it with a ſong; then they extoll'd him as beyond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare; <hi>Who is like unto thee, O Lord, amongſt the gods! who is like thee, glorious in holineſs, fearful in praiſes, doing wonders!</hi> There is a charming beauty in the courſe of providence, that calls often
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:003082_0027_0FEFB850A9306730"/>
for our admiration and praiſe. GOD often diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plays his righteouſneſs, in overruling the ſins of men to the accompliſhment of his own purpoſes; and his juſtice is diſplay'd in his letting wicked inſtruments, by wicked methods, bring about a terrible vengeance. And theſe <hi>works of the Lord are great, ſought out of all them that have pleaſure therein. His work is honourable and glorious; and his righteouſneſs endureth for ever. He hath made his wonderful works to be remembred.</hi> Pſal. 11. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, 3, 4. And therefore well may I ſay with the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> in the firſt verſe of the <hi>Pſalm: Praiſe ye the Lord, I will praiſe the Lord with my whole Heart, in the aſſembly of the upright, and in the congregation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. WE may from hence ſatiſfy ourſelves of the reaſonableneſs of our bearing ſuch treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with patience. Our enemies are not able to take the leaſt ſtep without the divine permiſſion. They are limited in every thing they attempt, and would ſet about. However they may curſe us cauſeleſſly, yet they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not inflict their own Curſe; and ſince the Curſe cauſeleſs does not take effect upon thoſe, againſt whom 'tis deſign'd, there can be little reaſon for our being very much diſturb'd and diſquieted by it. 'Tis indeed provoking to a perſon, to be ſo treated, when he has given no occaſion for it, and it may be ſome trouble; but this trouble is more eaſy to be born, than many others. And 'tis a ſign we are little acquainted with the great duty of ſelf denial, and the bearing the croſs, if we
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:003082_0028_0FEFB877D2BA4020"/>
cannot take patiently ſuch reproachful lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. If we cannot bear hard words, how ſhall we reſiſt unto blood? Beſides, as they are not able at their own pleaſure to inflict their cauſeleſs Curſe, ſo neither can they ſo much as curſe, without a divine permiſſion. And if we conſider the trouble, as under GOD's ordering, there is the more reaſon to bear it patiently; as <hi>David</hi> did when curſed by <hi>Shimei: Let him curſe, becauſe the Lord hath ſaid unto him, Curſe</hi> David. <hi>Who then ſhall ſay, Wherefore haſt thou done ſo?</hi> 2 Sam. 16. 10. And the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ather may we bear it patiently, ſince ſuch treatment has been the lot of good men in all ages. <hi>David</hi> I mention'd, and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, that tho' he had given them no cauſe, <hi>yet every one of the</hi> people <hi>did curſe him.</hi> Jer. 15. 10. And the thing is moſt notorious in the Apoſtles, and eſpecially in our LORD himſelf.</p>
            <p n="3">3. WE may hence be directed in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct toward them. We have more reaſon to pity them, than to be inrag'd by them. Poor ſouls! little do they think, what they are doing, when they are cauſeleſsly curſing their neighbours. They will not be able to do us a thouſandth part of the hurt, which without fail they do themſelves. We have no need to return them their own uſage. They will have enough of their own curſing, and need no addition of ours. Let us then follow the direction of our Lord: <hi>But I ſay unto you, love your enemies, bleſs them that curſe
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:003082_0029_0FEFB8545DECC828"/>
you, do good to them that hate you, and pray, for them which deſpightfully uſe you, and perſecute you.</hi> Mat. 5. 44. Our buſineſs is to pity, and pray for them, that the Curſe they impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate upon others, may, by their timely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, be prevented from ever falling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves.</p>
            <p n="4">4. LET us hence learn our duty to truſt in GOD, and be the more careful to perform it. We ought to truſt in him, to keep us from the miſchief our enemies would be glad to ſee fall upon us. Thus <hi>David</hi> incourag'd himſelf in the LORD his GOD, when <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> curs'd him: <hi>It may be the Lord will look upon my affliction, and that the Lord will requite me good for his curſing this day.</hi> 2 Sam. 17. 12. Let their malice drive us to our refuge, and make us the more confident in our prayers to GOD for his Bleſſing. The more ſincerely and heartily we truſt in him, the more eaſy we may well be: for this is a certain method of turning their curſe to an advantage. And therefore let us ſay with <hi>David: Let them curſe, but bleſs thou.</hi> Pſal. 109. 28.</p>
