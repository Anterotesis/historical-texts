            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                           <p>MY ancient love, if you can believe it, reaches to you, as in times paſt, and years, that are gone, even, in the divine root and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of love and life, that made us near to one another, above all worldly conſiderations; where our life, I hope, is hid with Chriſt, in God, our Father; ſo that, when he appears, we ſhall alſo appear with him, in glory; and in the meantime, through us, to thoſe that love and wait for his appearance, as the deſire of nations; that we may glorify God, his and our everlaſting Father, in our bodies, ſouls and ſpirits, in tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and eternal affairs; being indeed none of our own; foraſmuch as we are our own, we are none of the Lord's; a great myſtery, but a great truth, and of abſolute neceſſity to witneſs, to be of the number of the choſen nation, the peculiar people, and royal prieſthood of Chriſt, and his glorious kingdom.</p>
                           <p>Oh! my dear friends, let all below this keep on the left hand; and wait to feel thoſe bleſſed things, to inherit right hand; and in faith and courage, cry aloud to the Lord, for his renewing and refreſhing power, that may revive and reform his work upon your hearts and minds; and our humility, meekneſs, patience, ſelf-denial and charity, with a blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs walking, may plainly appear, and manifeſt the work of God upon our hearts, to thoſe that are without; which is not only the way to bring up the loiterers, and gather in the careleſs ones, to their duty, but fetch home and bring in, the ſtrangers, and the very enemies of the bleſſed truth, to confeſs and acknowledge that God is in you, and for you, of a truth.</p>
                           <p>Now, my dear friends, as to outward things, I have ſent a new Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, of years and experience; of a quiet, eaſy temper; that, I hope, will give offence to none; nor too eaſily put up any, if offered him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope of amendment. The Queen very graciouſly approved of him, at firſt offer, and gave him her hand to kiſs; and, at laſt, being intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the Earl of <hi>Godolphin,</hi> Lord High Treaſurer of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> at <hi>Windſor,</hi> ſhe added, <hi>"Sir, I wiſh you a good journey, and ſhall be ready to ſerve you."</hi> He is ſober, underſtands to command and obey, moderate in his temper, and of what they call a good family: his grandfather, Sir <hi>Vincent Gookin,</hi> having been an early great planter in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in King <hi>James</hi> the firſt, and the firſt Charles's days; and he intends, if not ill treated, to lay his bones, as well as ſubſtance among you; having taken leave of the war, and both <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> to live amongſt you; and as he is not voluptuous, ſo, I hope, he will be an example of thriftineſs. In ſhort, he has inſtructions, as much to the virtue, juſtice and peace of the country, as I can expreſs myſelf, or you deſire, for your comfortable living; pray, therefore, receive him kindly, and expreſs it, by a modeſt ſubſiſtence; or, rather, give it me, to give him, or, how you pleaſe.</p>

                     <p>HAVING this opportunity, we can do no leſs than congratulate thy ſeaſonable acceſſion to this government, and render our moſt grateful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments to the Queen, for her gracious accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Proprietary's nomination of thee, to ſupply his abſence, and to him, for conſtituting a perſon of ſo fair a character, furniſhed, as we hope, with a full reſolution, as well as power, to

redreſs the grievances, and remove the oppreſſions, that this poor province has, for ſome time, labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under, occaſioned by the irregular adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the late Deputy Governor; who was too much influenced by <hi>evil counſel;</hi> to which the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries and confuſion of the ſtate, and diviſions in the government, are principally owing.</p>
                     <p>We are ready to repreſent ſuch of thoſe public grievances, as are laid before us, or occur to our knowledge, in particular articles, and bring them to a proper examen; but, perceiving by thy meſſage to the houſe yeſterday, that thou art not ready, at this time, to proceed with us to buſineſs, we ſhall take leave only to mention ſome of thoſe things, of which the public weal of this country loudly calls for a moſt earneſt application and ſpeedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place, we are to lay before thee, that of the <hi>falſe alarm</hi> in May, 1706; wherein the late Governor was chief actor; and for which he is highly chargeable; having ſhot at the Queen's ſubjects, putting many of the inhabitants of this town in danger of their lives, and forced great quantities of powder and lead from the owners, and gave it to ſuch as waſted it, when he knew there was no occaſion to uſe it; whereby he deprived the place of what ammunition might be ready for thoſe, that had freedom to make uſe of it, for their defence, in caſe of an attack.</p>
                     <p>The next is that notorious act of hoſtility, he committed by firing ſhot at the Queen's ſubjects paſſing by <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> in the river, upon their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful trade, to and from this port.</p>
                     <p>We mention theſe, as they are, in our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, offences of a deep dye, and committed againſt the Queen's crown and dignity, as well as againſt the peace, and ought to be charged upon

him, before he departs this province; but the method of the proſecution againſt him we ſubmit to thy prudent care and diſcretion, and we ſhall be ready to do what is proper on our parts.</p>
                     <p>That the Treaſurer<note n="*" place="bottom">Viz. S.

                     </p>
                     <p>That the courts of judicature of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince have been, and are, erected by ordinances of the Governor and Council, againſt the advice, and without the aſſent of the Aſſembly; which we <hi>complain</hi> of, as a <hi>great oppreſſion</hi> and aggriev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the people, we repreſent, and deſire the ſame may be ſpeedily redreſſed, and the bill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the eſtabliſhing courts, with other uſeful bills, ready to be preſented to the Governor, may be conſidered.</p>

what might truly be called grievances, but alſo complained of ſome things as ſuch, which, in reality, and according to the laws and conſtitution, could not properly come under that name.</p>

                     <p>I thank you, gentlemen, for your congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulations, and do aſſure you, that I come with full reſolutions, on my part, to employ the power, with which the Proprietary has thought fit to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour me, and her Majeſty has graciouſly pleaſed to approve of, to render the people of this government as happy and eaſy as is poſſible for me, in all things, that ſhall concern their true intereſt, and be to their real advantage. I have enquired what might be meant by thoſe <hi>aggriev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, oppreſſions</hi> and <hi>confuſions,</hi> which you complain of, and whatſoever I ſhall meet with, that deſerves thoſe names, ſhall have my ready concurrence to remove them, as far as they ſhall appear; but muſt ſay, that, I believe, one effectual method to free all people from the apprehenſions of griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, will be, to lay all former animoſities and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies aſide, and, for the future, apply themſelves to ſuch buſineſs as they are concerned in, for the public, with a freedom and openneſs of temper, and an unbiaſſed inclination to promote the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:034421_0010_0FFD9E5873466B48"/>
good, without any other particular view: if we ſhould be ſo fortunate as to take example from her Majeſty's glorious adminiſtration of her domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions at home, and that of her parliament, we ſhould not fail of being extremely happy.</p>
                     <p>As to thoſe two paſt actions of my immediate predeceſſor, of which you complain, I can only inform you, that they were both well known in <hi>Britain,</hi> before I left it; and that I had no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to make any enquiry into them; and that, upon the beſt advice I can receive here, I find they will not properly fall under my cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance, in the ſtation I am placed in, and therefore cannot think it fit to concern myſelf with them.</p>
                     <p>But I am obliged to obſerve to you that the Council of the province, now with me, think themſelves very unjuſtly treated by the mention you have made of them, if they (as it is generally underſtood) be intended by the <hi>evil counſel,</hi> of which you have taken notice; and therefore, will take the liberty to vindicate themſelves, as you will ſee, by their application to me; to which I refer you.</p>
                     <p>The charge againſt the Treaſurer,* I find, is occaſioned by his and the Council's underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the act of Aſſembly, by which the money, that comes into his hands, has been granted, ſomewhat differently from what the <hi>preſent and late Houſes</hi> of Repreſentatives have done: he pleads the law, as his beſt direction; and you cannot but agree, that it is fit that this alone (I mean the law) ought to determine the matter. As far as I have hitherto been able, I have preſſed the collection of the taxes, and ſhall continue the beſt of my care, until they be finiſhed.</p>
                     <p>The method of eſtabliſhing courts, by the Governor and Council, was alſo well underſtood
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:034421_0011_0FFD9E4466E79458"/>
in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and was approved of there, as being grounded on unqueſtionable powers, grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Proprietary. The bill formerly propoſed by the Aſſembly, for that purpoſe, which is now before the board, has not been allowed of; but ſeeing the preſent eſtabliſhment, which was drawn, as I am informed, according to the plan laid down in that bill, carries ſome inconveniencies with it, and requires an alteration, I ſhall be ready to agree to any other reaſonable bill, that you ſhall hereafter propoſe, for ſettling courts of judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature, in ſuch a regular method, as may be a laſting rule for holding them.</p>
                     <p>I have no inſtructions, gentlemen, from her Majeſty, that will concern you; thoſe from the Proprietary being to myſelf, as occaſion offers, and where it may be proper, I ſhall acquaint you with the particulars. I have ordered copies of my commiſſion, and her Majeſty's approbation, to be prepared and delivered to you.</p>
                     <p>I ſhould now propoſe to your ſerious conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration ſome other matters of the higheſt import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, without which government cannot long ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt; as a due proviſion for the ſupport of it, and for the ſecurity of the people; but what I ſhall principally recommend to you, at this time, is the latter part of the laſt paragraph of your addreſs, <hi>viz.</hi> To prepare a bill for ſettling by law, how money ſhall be paid, upon contracts made, and to be made, before the new currency of money takes effect: This, as I find, by the great uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the people, is a matter that will require a very ſpeedy proviſion, and, therefore, hope you will find ſuch juſt and equal methods for it, as neither the debtors, on the one hand, nor credit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, on the other, may ſuffer by the alteration; to which I deſire you may forthwith proceed, with as little loſs of time as is poſſible; after which we

may have opportunity to enter into conſideration of ſuch other matters, as may naturally fall before you.</p>

                     <p>WE, the members of Council for the ſaid province, who attended the board, during the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the late Lieutenant Governor, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on viewing the addreſs preſented by the Aſſembly on the 9th day of March laſt, think ourſelves obliged to obſerve, that, in the firſt paragraph of it, complaining of <hi>aggrievances</hi> and <hi>oppreſſions,</hi> which, they ſay, this province has, for ſome time, laboured under, occaſioned by the irregular admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the late Deputy Governor, they have
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:034421_0013_0FFD9EBCF5B84608"/>
thought fit to add theſe words, <hi>who was too much influenced by evil counſel;</hi> to whom the miſeries and confuſions of the ſtate, and diviſions in the government, are principally owing.</p>
                     <p>It was long, may it pleaſe the Governor, before we could induce ourſelves to believe, that men, ſo well acquainted with the characters of moſt of us, in our ſeveral ſtations, in the country, could poſſibly intend us by the charge, until, by the obſervations of others, we were forced to take a nearer notice of the expreſſions; upon which we are ſorry to find, that the word <hi>counſel,</hi> as there uſed, together with the general conſtruction of the ſentence, ſeems not to admit of any other interpretation, but that to us principally is owing whatever the Aſſembly has thought fit to complain of, or, can reduce, under the general terms they have uſed: if they will diſavow any ſuch intention, we ſhall crave no other ſatisfaction; but, if not, we muſt then deſire, that they, and all men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in theſe affairs, may know,</p>
                     <p>That, notwithſtanding the Proprietary and late Lieutenant Governor, according to the eſtabliſhed rules in all governments whatſoever, from the moſt polite, to the moſt barbarous, nations in the world, finding themſelves under a neceſſity of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Council about them, to adviſe with, in affairs of government, have thought fit to chooſe us for that ſervice, in which, according to our ſeveral ſolemn engagements, we have acquitted our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to the beſt of our judgments and abilities, yet not one of us receives, or ever expects, any other advantage by it, than the ſatisfaction of having diſcharged our duties to the country we live in, and to advance the proſperity and happineſs of it, as much as may lie in our power. We have no ſalaries, nor allowance, paid us by the country for this, nor offices of profit, to encourage us;
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:034421_0014_0FFD7A0038799888"/>
what we do is at our own expenſe of time, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and charge, and upon our own eſtates is all our dependance, which, giving us as good an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the country, as others can pretend to, and being out of the reach of any poſſible views different from the good of the whole, no man, without a manifeſt violence to his reaſon, can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine but that we are as much concerned, and, therefore, would be as careful to prevent and divert any <hi>miſeries, confuſions, or diviſions,</hi> that may threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the province, as any other ſett of men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; ſo that this charge, from the Aſſembly, if levelled againſt us, is not only unjuſt, but will be judged, we believe, exceedingly ungrateful, by all that impartially conſider us, and our circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, among our neighbours.</p>
                     <p>After this general accuſation, involving us in all things, that have been irregularly commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or, that any perſon can think ſo to have been, they enumerate four particulars, which they call <hi>aggrievances.</hi> To the two firſt we have nothing to ſay; and we hope no man can believe, that any one of us was ſo much as privy to them, much leſs that we <hi>adviſed</hi> them; we here ſolemnly declare, each for himſelf, that we did not. The other two we acknowledge ourſelves to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in, and ſhall always juſtify: that is, firſt, That we adviſed the Treaſurer to take his directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the law alone, and without regard to the partial order of the aſſembly to the contrary, to make his payments in equal portions; which, we hope, cannot be accounted a <hi>grievance:</hi> and in the next, To prevent the greateſt of all poſſible <hi>grievances,</hi> the want of public juſtice, of which, by the meaſures taken by the Aſſembly of that time, the country was long deprived; we adviſed the Governor to make uſe of the powers, with which he was unqueſtionably veſted, to open the courts again, and to reſtore the courts of juſtice to the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:034421_0015_0FFD9EAD42BF9148"/>
oppreſſed country; which had long languiſhed through the want of it, until they could be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe eſtabliſhed. Men unacquainted with affairs of this kind, and who muſt take their information from others, may be impoſed on by perſons of deſign, and believe that to be irregular, which, in itſelf, is a moſt wholeſome and neceſſary act; but we can, with aſſurance, affirm, that we had full ſatisfaction, from men of the beſt abilities, that what we adviſed and concurred in this matter, was regular, juſt and legal.</p>
                     <p>Upon the whole, may it pleaſe the Governor, though on the one hand, we ſhall be exceedingly unwilling to have any miſunderſtanding with the repreſentatives of the people, well knowing it to be an unhappineſs, that all reaſonable meaſures ſhould be taken to prevent; yet, on the other, we ſhall not, by any contrivances, be diverted from diſcharging the truſt repoſed in us, during our continuance, in this ſtation, with honour and juſtice, to the beſt of our abilities; but, from time to time, ſhall offer to the Governor ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice as we ſhall judge moſt conducive to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good of the province; in the welfare of which we are ſo nearly concerned, in our ſeveral private intereſts; and in the meantime, hope we may juſtly expect to be ſecured from calumny and miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation.</p>

It is ſcarcely to be doubted that there was real occaſion, in ſome caſes, to complain of grievances, which demanded proper attention and relief; but the word <hi>grievance,</hi> was become com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and ſo often uſed, that its proper applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeems not always to have been ſufficiently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to; for it is certain, that by too much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging a diſpoſition and habit of complaint, it has ſometimes remarkably affected the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men, and magnified, in appearance, what was but ſmall, in reality; and there have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, wherein it has ſo far prevailed as to induce the mind entirely to miſtake one thing for another, and to create a firm belief of the abſolute exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of what, in truth, had no being.</p>

be here obſerved, that it does not appear reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble why this principle of the <hi>Quakers</hi> againſt war,<note place="margin">The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples againſt war not to be ſo much blamed as they are by ſome, &amp;c.</note> and the evil conſequences ariſing from it, when duly conſidered, ſhould be an objection, ſo very material, as ſome perſons make it, againſt any claſs or deſcription, of people, in the general community, whoſe profitable induſtry, and benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent conduct, in all other reſpects, render them of ſo much the greater utility, and real benefit to the public and common good, even, in this, and every other department; and that more eſpecially in theſe latter, more improved, or refined ages of the world, ſince war is become more a trade, or ſtudy of a certain claſs of men only, and more reſtricted to, and managed by, a part of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral community, appropriated to that purpoſe, than it was formerly, in the more barbarous ſtate of mankind, when every one went to war, capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of bearing arms, while now it is experienced that the far greater part of the people, in all the moſt civilized ſtates, are better, or more prefera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly employed, in promoting and procuring the neceſſary ſupport of the whole community, at large: it would be a very great impropriety, to blame any one member of the human body, which is confined, or appointed to one particular office, for not performing that of another; for which it is neither qualified, nor intended, by the Author of human nature: the body politic con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of many parts, or members, as well as the human; and their offices, in a well regulated ſtate, are as various:<note place="margin">They are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with humanity, than the contrary &amp;c</note> wiſdom is no leſs requiſite than ſtrength; and the arts of peace, with the labours of the induſtrious coloniſt, are, at leaſt, as neceſſary as thoſe of war; which would ſoon make but a very ſorry figure, in any nation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thoſe means, which are the effects of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.

which diſtinguiſh the rational from the irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional creation, as not to be ſenſible, that it is better by wiſdom, or good policy, to prevent war, than by force of arms, and the art military to ſupport, or only to ſuſpend it? For it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the application of a thing, by which, in reality, that ſame thing ſolely exiſts, and is kept alive, ſhould put an end to it, or entirely take away its exiſtence. War is certainly the greateſt puniſhment in the world, that the Almighty hath aſſigned for the wickedneſs of the human race; and it is the departure of mankind from their true intereſt, and real good alone, which makes it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; conſequently, as a principle of thinking and acting gains ground, or increaſes, in the world, which approaches neareſt to the ſtandard of truth, and takes away the cauſe of puniſhment, in the ſame proportion, muſt the neceſſity and practice of this evil decreaſe in it.</p>

But, which is ſtill more remarkable, that people profeſſedly of a different way of thinking, in this particular, ſhould, in greater numbers, and much more abundantly, flock into <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> from abroad, than into any other of the colonies beſides; and yet this has been the real caſe here, both in later years, and alſo in the more early times of the province: which certainly ſhewed a very diſtinguiſhing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, which, in reality, was thereby given to the <hi>Quakers</hi> and their principles, notwithſtanding

the high abſurdity, which any of thoſe people, who have thus made <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> their choice, may ſince have exhibited, by declaiming againſt them on this account: for it cannot be reaſonably ſuppoſed they were ignorant that this country, and the government of it, could not poſſibly have been granted, at firſt, to the <hi>Quakers,</hi> on account of their <hi>fighting principles,</hi> or that they ſhould <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it with arms,</hi> by any who properly knew them, notwithſtanding they were empowered, or entruſted, ſo to do, if they choſe it; but, on the contrary, for thoſe other qualifications, at leaſt, not leſs neceſſary and beneficial,<note place="margin">Intention of the grant and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, &amp;c.</note> for the ſupport and real happineſs of any country, of which the King and government, at that time, were fully ſenſible the <hi>Quakers</hi> were poſſeſſed; becauſe, in a nation, where ſufficient numbers of fighting men are not wanting, on occaſion, and may, at any time, be had for money, to defend all parts of its dominions, and where no man, by the laws, is compelled to fight, who pays his equivalent to the ſupport of the government, there would be no abſolute neceſſity, neither was it intended, in the grant of the province, and of the powers of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning it, under the crown, to take theſe peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able people from that proper attention, which was due to the department, in which they were placed, for the general good, in their civil capacity; nor, on that account, to oppreſs any one part of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, for the ſake of the other's advantage, unequally.</p>
               <p>This appears to have been the principal end and deſign of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> government, at firſt, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this province, notwithſtanding thoſe demands of a <hi>military nature,</hi> which, either from a miſtaken notion of thereby more effectually ſerving the public utility, or from other views, different from the real nature and original deſign of the firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement and conſtitution of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> have

               <p>To this they added, in their addreſs, "That they humbly hoped he would be pleaſed to accept this, as a teſtimony of their unfeigned loyalty, and thankful acknowledgment, for her grace and clemency towards them, and the reſt of her ſubjects; and though the meanneſs of the preſent were ſuch as was unworthy of the favour of her acceptance (which indeed, ſaid they, was cauſed not through want of good-will, and loyal affection, but by inabilty and poverty,<note place="margin">The Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly plead poverty, &amp;c.</note> occaſioned by great loſſes, late taxes miſapplied,<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <note place="margin">Part of a meſſage from the Governor.</note>"But now, gentlemen, I muſt be ſo plain as to tell you, that, though I have been very deſirous to ſee all theſe matters brought to a ripeneſs, that they might actually be paſſed into laws, yet, until I ſee the country as ready to diſcharge their duty, in providing for my ſupport, in the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, independent of any ſupply from the Propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etary, who, as I told you before, cannot now (were it even reaſonable) ſpare any part of his eſtate here, to that purpoſe, I ſhall account myſelf very unjuſt to the duty I owe myſelf, if I concur in any other public act, in legiſlation, though truly inclinable to do all, for the advantage of the public, that can reaſonably be expected from me: but a Governor cannot lie under a greater obligation to the people, than they do to him; nor can that be
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:034421_0033_0FFD9DFCBA87D748"/>
accounted a free gift from them, which is but their indiſpenſible duty; for, at this time, there is no ſupport for a Governor, in this government, but what muſt be granted by an act of an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. You have told me, that you had voted <hi>five hundred pounds</hi> to the Queen, <hi>three hundred pounds</hi> for the ſervice of the public, and <hi>two hundred pounds</hi> to me; and you have lately informed me, that when I had paſſed the other acts, the Speaker would preſent a bill to me, for raiſing that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. It is poſſible when the others were paſſed, the Speaker might do ſo; but, can it, in reaſon, be expected, that, while you ſhew ſo unprecedented and unuſual diffidence, on your ſide, that you would not ſo much as let me ſee the bill, but in private, nor allow, that it ſhould, upon any terms,<note place="margin">The Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly allow not their bill to be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the Council, &amp;c.</note> be communicated to the Council, with whom I am to adviſe, (though you cannot but be ſenſible, that, ſhould I deſign it, yet it is not in my power to paſs a bill into a law, until the Speaker has ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it) which is uſually done at the time of paſſing it. Could it be expected, I ſay, that I ſhould paſs all that you deſired of me, and then depend on your preſenting that bill? Or, can it be thought reaſonable, or, for the ſecurity of the public, that I ſhould paſs an act, for raiſing and applying <hi>eight hundred pounds,</hi> for ſeveral uſes, beſides thoſe <hi>two hundred pounds,</hi> ſaid to be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me, without taking proper advice upon it, of thoſe, whom the diſcharge of my duty, as well as my inclinations, obliges me to conſult, in all public matters; nor that I ſhould have it in my power to object to, or alter, any part of the whole bill, after it is preſented? No, gentlemen, as I have no deſigns, but what are plain and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, ſo I muſt expect a ſuitable treatment; and, therefore, I now deſire you faithfully to lay before the people, whom you repreſent, and to whom you are returning, what I have here ſaid to you;

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing any bill without conſent of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, &amp;c.</note>By this plain declaration of the Governor, the Aſſembly eaſily perceived, to their great mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that, by reaſon of the Proprietary's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, the Governor could not paſs any bill, without the advice, or approbation of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; which, how reaſonable ſoever it might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, in itſelf, was deemed to have no foundation in the royal charter; by which the whole power of legiſlation was underſtood to be veſted in the Governor, and the repreſentatives of the people. This the Houſe obſerved in their remonſtrance to the Governor, the next day, declaring, that had they known he was ſo reſtricted, they would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have given him, nor themſelves, ſo much trouble, as they had done: they likewiſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of ſome other matters, that were not redreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:<note place="margin">Their greateſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment againſt James Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, &amp;c.</note> but their greateſt reſentment appears, in this remonſtrance, to be againſt the Secretary, <hi>James Logan;</hi> againſt whom is exhibited, in a very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry manner, a long complaint; repreſenting him as the grand obſtacle of their proceedings; and, that, though they had endeavoured to reduce him within proper bounds, yet, by reaſon of his great

influence with the Governor and Proprietary, he was now advanced above their power, obſtructed all their public tranſactions, that did not pleaſe him, treated the Members of the Houſe with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult and abuſe, and, in effect, was the chief cauſe of their grievances and calamities.</p>
               <p>In October next following,<note place="margin">The old Aſſembly moſtly re-choſen.</note> the ſame Members of Aſſembly were moſtly re-elected, and <hi>David Lloyd</hi> again choſen Speaker: to whom the Governor, in his ſpeech, on the 17th, after having mentioned divers other affairs, before the former Aſſembly, unfiniſhed, and further preſſed their making due proviſion for the ſupport of the lieutenancy of the government, a duty, which, he ſaid, was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon them, that without it, no govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could have a being; he thus expreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen, you are met for no other end,<note place="margin">Part of the Governor's ſpeech to the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</note> than to ſerve the country, whom you repreſent; I hope, therefore, you will ſtudy all poſſible means, that may contribute to the real happineſs of that: which, I believe, you will find, may be much promoted by improving a good underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between you and me, in our reſpective ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>"I would not willingly look back upon ſome of the proceedings of the laſt Houſe, only from thence I muſt give you a neceſſary caution, to dwell leſs, than has been done, on that general language of <hi>evil counſel,</hi> or counſellors, generally uſed, as an artful method, to ſtrike at the <hi>counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;</hi> but, with me, I believe, without occaſion; or, that of <hi>grievances</hi> and <hi>oppreſſions,</hi> words, by God's bleſſing, underſtood by few, (I find) in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, who form them not in their own <hi>imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> for I aſſure you, gentlemen, if we are not as happy as the circumſtances of the place will admit, it lies much in your power to make us ſo;

of which I hope you will conſider, and uſe your endeavours accordingly, with a full reſolution to remove whatever may ſtand in the way.</p>
               <p>"I have already ſaid, that I would not look back to the proceedings of the laſt Houſe; but the Secretary has found himſelf ſo much aggriev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their remonſtrance, that he has preſented, for my peruſal, a long defence; in which I ſhall not think myſelf any further concerned, than to obſerve to you, that, to my ſurpriſe, he has charged the Speaker of that Houſe with ſome proceedings, which, if true, will require your conſideration, and ſome further meaſures to be taken upon them; for which reaſon, I have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him to lay a copy of them before you; and I muſt ſay, if that repreſentation be well grounded, I cannot ſee that, under this govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſuch a perſon can be accounted fit for that ſtation; but, at preſent, I ſhall no further enquire into it, only recommend to you, to proceed with diligence, in whatever is incumbent on you, in your ſtations, as well in this, as in all other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that may concern the welfare of the public, and honor of this government, as now eſtabliſhed."</p>

<pb n="37" facs="unknown:034421_0037_0FFD9EA391FC1C58"/>
are not obliged to contribute to the ſupport of that adminiſtration, which affords them no redreſs, when their rights are violated, their liberties infringed, and their repreſentative body affronted and abuſed: hence it is, that that branch of the legiſlative authority ſeldom move to give ſupplies till their aggrievances are redreſſed, and reparation made, for the <hi>indignities</hi> they meet with from the other branch of the ſame authority.</p>
               <p>"We are very ſenſible that the end of our meeting is to ſerve the country; and we aſſure the Governor, there ſhall be nothing wanting, on our parts, to promote it, and improve a good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding between him and us, in our reſpective ſtations: but let not the language of the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of the people, about <hi>evil counſellors, grievances</hi> and <hi>oppreſſions,</hi> be irkſome to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor; for we ſhall not anſwer the true end of our meeting, nor diſcharge our duty and truſt to thoſe, that ſent us, if we be ſilent, and not inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on redreſſing thoſe things, that are amiſs, with a reſolution to uſe our endeavours to remove what appears to ſtand in the way.</p>
               <p>"We have, with all the application, this ſhort time could allow, informed ourſelves of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the late Aſſemblies, and find no juſt grounds for the Governor to ſuppoſe that their complaints of <hi>evil counſel</hi> or <hi>counſellors</hi> have been uſed as methods to ſtrike at him; but, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, it was their care, as we find it to be ours, that the Governor may not be impoſed on, or prevailed with, to adhere to <hi>evil counſel,</hi> and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his actings inconſiſtent.</p>
               <p>"We ſuppoſe it needleſs to be more expreſs, than the late Aſſembly have been, to demonſtrate what an enemy the Secretary has been to the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of this province; and how abuſive he has
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:034421_0038_0FFD9EA94FFFFA50"/>
been to the repreſentatives of the people; ſo that we can do no leſs than repeat the requeſt of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Aſſemblies, to have him removed from the Governor's Council; which we doubt not will be a moſt effectual means to improve a good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding between thee and us.</p>
               <p>"If the Governor will look back, and duly conſider the complaints and remonſtrances of the late Aſſemblies, it will appear, that <hi>grievances</hi> and <hi>oppreſſions</hi> are words, which are formed upon juſt complaints; and for which the country wants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs; ſo that what the Governor ſuppoſes, on that head, is not candid towards the repreſentatives of the people.</p>
               <p>"May it pleaſe the Governor, whatever might be the occaſion, or deſign, of the laſt clauſe, in thy ſpeech, we are of opinion, it was not well timed; for if the Secretary's charge, againſt our Speaker, had any weight, it ſhould have been propounded as an objection againſt the Aſſembly's choice of him, for Speaker: but, after thou hadſt declared thy approbation of their choice, that thou ſhouldſt be prevailed upon ſo far to patronize the Secretary's inſinuation againſt the Speaker, as to make it a part of thy ſpeech to us, before we had ſeen, or heard, the charge, we can do no leſs than reſent it, as an <hi>indignity</hi> offered to this Houſe; for, though we are men, that cannot be much meaner in the Governor's eye, than we are in our own eſteem, yet we muſt put him in mind, that, ſince the royal charter commits this part of the legiſlative authority to our care, we ought to have the regard, due to our ſtations."</p>
               <p>After this the Governor went to <hi>Newcaſtle;</hi> and in the mean time the Aſſembly adjourned. On their meeting again, about the beginning of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, the Secretary, <hi>James Logan,</hi> intending

                           <p>THAT, whereas the Aſſembly of this province, choſen the firſt day of October, 1706, thought fit (as is well known to you) in the month of February, in the ſame year, to exhibit to the then Lieutenant Governor, certain articles of impeachment againſt me; copies of which have been induſtriouſly diffuſed abroad; and, ſince that time, other complaints have alſo been preſented; and upon the preſumption, that thoſe accuſations might be true, divers applications have been made, by the laſt Aſſembly, to the preſent Lieutenant Governor, requeſting that I might be removed from his Council, &amp;c.</p>
                           <p>Yet, ſo it is, may it pleaſe the Houſe, that not one of theſe arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, or complaints, have ever, to this day, been duly heard, or, at any time, ſo proved, or, even, rendered intelligible, as that, according to juſtice, I might have the opportunity of anſwering them, or ſpeaking in my own juſtification, notwithſtanding I had, by ſeveral repeated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, earneſtly preſſed to obtain that favour; by which means, and the endeavours, that divers perſons, highly diſaffected to me, have uſed to calumniate me, among the inhabitants of the province, I have been moſt grievouſly injured and oppreſſed; now, inaſmuch as, for ſome months paſt, it has been generally known, that I am ſpeedily to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take a voyage for <hi>Great Britain,</hi> whither the Proprietor's affairs do, at preſent, urgently call me; and being, by the late Aſſembly's moſt bitter remonſtrance againſt me, laid under a greater neceſſity than ever, to clear myſelf of the ſeveral unjuſt imputations, that have been thrown on me, leſt any perſon, in thoſe diſtant places, to which I am to repair, and to which the Aſſembly's papers have been ſolicitouſly tranſmitted, ſhould be ſo far impoſed on, as to believe that thoſe accuſations, without any trial, have really ſome weight in them; which, upon a trial, notwithſtanding, I have no cauſe to doubt, but will totally diſappear: I, therefore, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſeech this Houſe, that, for rendering me the relief, that is due to the great wrongs, I have ſuſtained, they would be graciouſly pleaſed to order all thoſe, who have appeared againſt me, the ſevereſt and moſt implacable, of my enemies, whoever they be, to proceed in proſecuting me, with their utmoſt zeal and ardour; that the very worſt of my fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in public affairs, may be drawn in the moſt legible characters, and expoſed without mercy, to the eyes of all men; to the end that, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding them, they may fully know the extent of my crimes; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon regard me, as I ſhall be found to deſerve, and not otherwiſe.</p>
                           <p>But, becauſe the time of my departure now draws nigh, I muſt, therefore, further beſeech the Houſe, that this proſecution may be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on, within ſuch a convenient time, as is conſiſtent with the ſhortneſs of my intended ſtay; and, particularly, that it may not extend beyond the twelfth of this inſtant; that being the utmoſt (as far as I can at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent judge) that I ſhall be able to attend it; and, I hope, will prove a ſufficient time, to diſpatch all that is neceſſary to ſuch a trial; within the compaſs of which ſpace, I have been well aſſured, the Governor will be ready, on his part, to hear whatever ſhall be alledged againſt me, and as far as in him lies, give ſuch judgment thereupon, as to juſtice ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long.

and be attended with approbation and contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, according to their believed importance, and the various mediums, through which they are ſeen: this province appears to have been never entirely without a diſcontented and murmuring party in it, from the beginning,<note place="margin">Party in the province in early time, &amp;c.</note> or, at leaſt, from very early times; who thought it their duty and intereſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to oppoſe the Proprietary, in all caſes indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminately, where either his power, or intereſt, was concerned; and though frequently but ſmall and weak, yet they were ſufficiently able to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſs the public proceedings, and endanger the general tranquillity, according as time and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity offered: theſe, for a number of years paſt, having, by continual complaints of great and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous grievances unredreſſed, worked up the minds of many well-diſpoſed perſons, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, into the belief of the reality of more of this kind than ever exiſted in it, thereby occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hard thoughts of the Proprietary, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of an unworthy treatment, even, from ſome of his friends; inſomuch, that, for a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time, they had obtained a majority in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, and viſibly acted in the extreme againſt him.</p>
               <p>The increaſe of this oppoſition ſeems principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have ariſen from the Proprietary's abſence, his not ſeeing with his own eyes,<note place="margin">Party in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by the Propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etor's ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, &amp;c.</note> and truſting his affairs too much to deputies; to which the nature and neceſſity of his ſituation and circumſtances, in theſe times, particularly obliged him; as fully appears by many of his private letters, during the latter part of his life, largely expreſſing his ardent and longing deſire to live and die in this country; conſequently ſome things, in his province, were not in that order, which could have been deſired, though far from being as they were repreſented; which, in ſuch a new, young and unexperienced

government, in a colony compoſed of ſuch an heterogeneous mixture of people of different hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, opinions and intereſts, and in a land of ſo great liberty, as this then was, ſo much the more required the preſence of an able and conſtant hand, to manage and redreſs; though, in the whole, compared with others, it was manifeſtly in a very happy, thriving and flouriſhing condition.</p>
               <p>From hence, however, his adverſaries,<note place="margin">And endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, &amp;c.</note> and the diſcontented party, took occaſion to magnify what was amiſs; and, as it is an eaſy matter to perſuade people that they are aggrieved, more eſpecially when under ſuch a variety of difficulties as is common and natural, at leaſt in ſome degree, to any new ſettlement of this kind, they, therefore, influenced many of the <hi>well-meaning</hi> to join in the oppoſition; which was now carried on with a high hand; though, it is, with great reaſon, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, divers of theſe neither deſigned, nor ſaw, the conſequence, to which their proceedings naturally and ultimately tended; which, at length, about this time, produced the following ſevere and expoſtulatory letter from the Proprietary to the Aſſembly, <hi>viz.</hi>

                        <note place="margin">1710.</note>When it pleaſed God to open a way for me to ſettle that colony, I had reaſon to expect a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid comfort from the ſervices, done to many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of people; and it was no ſmall ſatisfaction to me, that I have not been diſappointed in ſeeing them proſper, and growing up to a flouriſhing country, bleſſed with liberty, eaſe and plenty, beyond what many of themſelves could expect; and wanting nothing to make themſelves happy, but what, with a right temper of mind, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent conduct, they might give themſelves. But, alas! as to my part, inſtead of reaping the like advantages, ſome of the greateſt of my troubles have aroſe from thence; the many combats, I have engaged in; the great pains, and incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble expenſe, for your welfare and eaſe, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of my former eſtate; of which (however ſome there would repreſent it) I too ſenſibly feel the effects; with the undeſerved oppoſition, I have met with from thence, ſink me into ſorrow; that, if not ſupported by a ſuperior hand, might have overwhelmed me long ago. And I cannot but think it hard meaſure, that, while that has proved a land of freedom and flouriſhing, it ſhould become to me, by whoſe means it was principally made a country, the cauſe of grief, trouble and poverty.</p>
                     <p>For this reaſon I muſt deſire you all, even, of all profeſſions and degrees, for although all have not been engaged in the meaſures, that have been taken, yet every man, who has an intereſt there, is, or muſt be, concerned in them, by their effects; I muſt, therefore, I ſay, deſire you all, in a ſerious and true weightineſs of mind, to conſider what you are, or have been, doing; why matters muſt be carried on with theſe diviſions and contentions, and what real cauſes have been given, on my ſide, for that oppoſition to me, and my intereſt, which I have met with; as if I were
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:034421_0047_0FFD9E9F81DF4B38"/>
an enemy, and not a friend, after all I have done and ſpent, both here and there: I am ſure, I know not of any cauſe whatſoever. Were I ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible you really wanted any thing of me, in the relation between us, that would make you hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier, I ſhould readily grant it, if any reaſonable man would ſay it were fit for you to demand; provided you would alſo take ſuch meaſures as were fit for me to join with.</p>
                     <p>Before any one family had tranſported them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thither, I earneſtly endeavoured to form ſuch a model of government, as might make all, concerned in it, eaſy; which, nevertheleſs, was ſubject to be altered, as there ſhould be occaſion. Soon after we got over, that model appeared, in ſome parts of it, to be very inconvenient, if not impracticable; the numbers of members, both in the Council and Aſſembly, were much too large; ſome other matters alſo proved inconſiſtent with the King's charter to me; ſo that, according to the power reſerved for an alteration, there was a neceſſity to make one, in which, if the lower counties were brought in, it was well known, at that time, to be on a view of advantage to the province itſelf, as well as to the people of thoſe counties, and to the general ſatisfaction of thoſe concerned, without the leaſt apprehenſion of any irregularity in the method.</p>
                     <p>Upon this they had another charter paſſed, <hi>nemine contradicente;</hi> which I always deſired might be continued, while you yourſelves would keep up to it, and put it in practice; and many there know much it was againſt my will, that, upon my laſt going over, it was vacated. But after this was laid aſide (which indeed was begun by yourſelves, in Colonel <hi>Fletcher</hi>'s time) I, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my engagement, left another, with all the privileges, that were found convenient for your
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:034421_0048_0FFD9EA60100CA48"/>
good government; and, if any part of it has been, in any caſe, infringed, it was never by my approbation. I deſired it might be enjoyed fully. But though privileges ought to be tenderly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, they ſhould not, on the other hand, be aſſerted, under that name, to a licentiouſneſs: the deſign of government is to preſerve good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; which may be equally broke in upon by the turbulent endeavours of the people, as well as the overſtraining of power, in a Governor. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned the people ſhould be ſecured of an annual fixed election and Aſſembly; and that they ſhould have the ſame privileges in it, that any other Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly has, in the Queen's dominions; among all which this is one conſtant rule, as in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament here, that they ſhould ſit on their own adjournments; but to ſtrain this expreſſion to a power, to meet, at all times during the year, without the Governor's concurrence, would be to diſtort government, to break the due propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the parts of it, to eſtabliſh confuſion in the place of neceſſary order, and make the legiſlative the executive part of government. Yet, for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining this power, I perceive, much time and money has been ſpent, and great ſtruggles have been made, not only for this, but ſome other things, that cannot, at all, be for the advantage of the people to be poſſeſſed of; particularly the appointing of Judges; becauſe the adminiſtration might, by ſuch means, be ſo clogged, that it would be difficult, if poſſible, under our cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, at ſome times, to ſupport it. As for my own part, as I deſire nothing more than the tranquillity and proſperity of the province and government, in all its branches, could I ſee that any of theſe things, that have been contended for, would certainly promote theſe ends, it would be a matter of indifference to me how they were ſettled. But ſeeing the frame of every government ought
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:034421_0049_0FFD9E2BC68D0080"/>
to be regular in itſelf, well proportioned and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate, in its parts, and every branch of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with ſufficient power to diſcharge its reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive duty, for the ſupport of the whole, I have cauſe to believe that nothing could be more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to it, than to take ſo much of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, and executive part of the government out of the Governor's hands, and lodge it in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain collective body; and more eſpecially ſince our government is dependent, and I am anſwerable to the crown, if the adminiſtration ſhould fail, and a ſtop be put to the courſe of juſtice. On theſe conſiderations I cannot think it prudent, in the people, to crave theſe powers; becauſe not only I, but they themſelves, would be in danger of ſuffering by it; could I believe otherwiſe, I ſhould not be againſt granting any thing of this kind, that were aſked of me, with any degree of common prudence and civility. But, inſtead of finding cauſe to believe, the contentions, that have been raiſed about theſe matters, have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded only from miſtakes of judgment, with an earneſt deſire, notwithſtanding, at the bottom, to ſerve the public (which, I hope, has ſtill been the inducement of ſeveral concerned in them) I have had but too ſorrowful a view and ſight to complain of the manner, in which I have been treated. The attacks on my reputation, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny indignities put upon me, in papers ſent over hither, into the hands of thoſe who could not be expected to make the moſt diſcreet and charitable uſe of them; the ſecret inſinuations againſt <hi>my juſtice,</hi> beſides the attempt, made upon my eſtate; reſolves paſt in the Aſſemblies, for turning my <hi>quit-rents,</hi> never ſold by me, to the ſupport of government; my lands entered upon, without any regular method; my manors invaded, (under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence I had not duly ſurveyed them) and both theſe by perſons principally concerned in theſe attempts
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:034421_0050_0FFD9E4BEDFB5CC0"/>
againſt me here; a right to my overplus land, unjuſtly claimed by the poſſeſſors of the tracts, in which they are found; my private eſtate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually exhauſting, for the ſupport of that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, both here and there; and no proviſion made for it by that country; to all which I cannot but add, the violence, that has been particularly ſhewn to my Secretary; of which (though I ſhall, by no means, protect him in any thing, he can be juſtly charged with, but ſuffer him to ſtand or fall by his own actions) I cannot but thus far take notice, that, from all theſe charges, I have ſeen, or heard of, againſt him, I have cauſe to believe, that had he been as much in oppoſition to me, as he has been underſtood to ſtand for me, he might have met with a milder treatment from his proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors; and, to think that any man ſhould be the more expoſed there, on my account, and, inſtead of finding favour, meet with enmity, for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing engaged in my ſervice, is a melancholy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration! In ſhort, when I reflect on all theſe heads, of which I have ſo much cauſe to complain, and, at the ſame time, think of the hardſhips I, and my ſuffering family, have been reduced to, in no ſmall meaſure, owing to my endeavours for, and diſappointments from, that province, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but mourn the unhappineſs of my portion, dealt to me from thoſe, of whom I had reaſon to expect much better and different things; nor can I but lament the unhappineſs, that too many of them are bringing on themſelves, who, inſtead of purſuing the amicable ways of peace, love and unity, which, at firſt, hoped to find in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, are cheriſhing a ſpirit of contention and oppoſition; and, blind to their own intereſt, are overſetting that foundation, on which your hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs might be built.</p>
                     <p>Friends, the eyes of many are upon you; the people of many notions of <hi>Europe</hi> look on that
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:034421_0051_0FFD9E0409630F98"/>
country, as a land of eaſe and quiet, wiſhing to themſelves, in vain, the ſame bleſſings, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you may enjoy: but, to ſee the uſe you make of them, is no leſs the cauſe of ſurpriſe to others, while ſuch bitter complaints and reflections are ſeen to come from you, of which it is difficult to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, even, the ſenſe or meaning. Where are the <hi>diſtreſſes, grievances,</hi> and <hi>oppreſſions,</hi> that the papers, ſent from thence, ſo often ſay, you lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh under! while others have cauſe to believe, you have hitherto lived, or might live, the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt of any, in the Queen's dominions?</p>
                     <p>Is it ſuch a <hi>grievous oppreſſion,</hi> that the <hi>courts</hi> are eſtabliſhed by my power, founded on the king's charter, without a law of your making, when upon the ſame plan you propoſe? If this diſturb any, take the advice of other able lawyers on the main, without tying me up to the opinion of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally one man, whom I cannot think ſo very proper to direct in my affairs (for, I believe, the late Aſſembly have had but that one lawyer amongſt them) and I am freely content you ſhould have any law, that, by proper judges, ſhould be found ſuitable. Is it your <hi>oppreſſion</hi> that the <hi>officers fees</hi> are not ſettled by an act of Aſſembly? No man can be a greater enemy to extortion, than myſelf: do, therefore, allow ſuch fees as may reaſonably encourage fit perſons to undertake theſe offices, and you ſhall ſoon have (and ſhould have always cheerfully had) mine, and, I hope, my Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant's concurrence and approbation. Is it ſuch an <hi>oppreſſion,</hi> that licences for public houſes have not been ſettled, as has been propoſed? It is a certain ſign you are ſtrangers to <hi>oppreſſion,</hi> and know nothing but the name, when you ſo highly beſtow it on matters ſo inconſiderable; but that buſineſs, I find, is adjuſted. Could I know any <hi>real oppreſſion,</hi> you lie under, that is in my power to remedy (and what I wiſh you would take pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:034421_0052_0FFD9EC500199AB0"/>
meaſures to remedy, if you truly feel any ſuch) I would be as ready, on my part, to remove them, as you to deſire it; but according to the beſt judgment, I can make of the complaints, I have ſeen (and you once thought I had a pretty good one) I muſt, in a deep ſenſe of ſorrow, ſay, that I fear, the kind hand of Providence, that has ſo long favoured and protected you, will, by the ingratitude of many there to the great mercies of God, hitherto ſhewn them, be, at length, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to convince them of their unworthineſs; and, by changing the bleſſings, that ſo little care has been taken, by the public, to deſerve, into calamities, and reduce thoſe, that have been ſo clamorous, and cauſeleſsly diſcontented, to a true, but ſmarting ſenſe of their duty. I write not this, with a deſign to include all; I doubt not, many of you have been burdened at, and can, by no means, join in the meaſures that have been taken; but while ſuch things appear under the name of an Aſſembly, that ought to repreſent the whole, I cannot but ſpeak more generally than I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, though I am not unſenſible what methods may be uſed to obtain the weight of ſuch a name.</p>
                     <p>I have already been tedious, and ſhall now, therefore, briefly ſay, that the oppoſition, I have met with from thence muſt, at length, force me to conſider more cloſely of my own private and ſinking circumſtances, in relation to that province. In the mean time, I deſire you all ſeriouſly to weigh what I have wrote, together with your duty to yourſelves, to me, and to the world, who have their eyes upon you, and are witneſſes of my early and earneſt care for you. I muſt think there is a regard due to me, that has not of late been paid; pray, conſider of it fully, and think ſoberly, what you have to deſire of me, on the one hand, and ought to perform to me, on the other; for, from
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:034421_0053_0FFD9ECAFA1648F8"/>
the next Aſſembly, I ſhall expect to know what you reſolve, and what I may depend on. If I muſt continue my regards to you, let me be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to it by a like diſpoſition in you towards me. But, if a plurality, after this, ſhall think they owe me none, or no more, than for ſome years I have met with, let it, on a fair election, be ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, and I ſhall then, without further ſuſpenſe, know what I have to rely upon. God give you his wiſdom and fear, to direct you, that yet our poor country may be bleſſed with peace, love and induſtry, and we may once more meet good friends, and live ſo to the end; our relation, in the truth, having but the ſame true intereſt.</p>
                     <p>I am, with great truth, and moſt ſincere regard, your real Friend, as well as juſt Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Governor,</p>

               <p>The Governor, in his ſpeech to the Houſe, on the 16th of the month,<note place="margin">Part of the Governor's ſpeech to the new Aſſembly.</note> told them, "That he did not doubt it was obvious to every one's under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, why he could not agree with the laſt Aſſembly; but, as he took them to have different ſentiments, they might promiſe themſelves, that his ready aſſent to all bills, drawn up for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic good, would not be wanting; and that, as he had often expreſſed his reſolution of ſettling among them, he could have no aims, contrary to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the people: that thus a confidence might be eſtabliſhed in each other, he hoped, they would cheerfully proceed with their bills, and make ſuch proviſion for the ſupport of the government as conſiſted with the character, that the province juſtly bore, in all her Majeſty's dominions. He concluded with recommending them to diſpatch, and cautioning them to avoid the expenſe of a long ſitting; a practice, that ſome former Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, by giving way to, had left a debt upon the country, that, perhaps, they would not very eaſily diſcharge."</p>

                           <p>Samuel Carpenter arrived very early in the province, and was one of the moſt conſiderable traders and ſettlers in <hi>Pennſylvania;</hi> where he held, for many years, ſome of the greateſt offices in the government; and through a great variety of buſineſs he preſerved the love and eſteem of a large and extenſive acquaintance.

                                    <p>He added, That, in the laſt council, which they held with us, they ſpoke concerning the ſun; by whoſe influence they had lived in warmth and plenty, from the beginning; that they now deſired the ſame happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs might be continued to them with us, in the firmeſt peace; and that it might laſt as long as the ſun ſhould endure: that when any clouds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe between them and the ſun, it brings coolneſs, and is unpleaſant; the ſame will be, if any cloud ſhould ariſe between them and us; and, therefore, they deſire, if any thing of that kind appear, it may be diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated, without delay.</p>
                                    <p>He laid down a third belt, and continued in the ſame ſtrain, deſiring as before, that they might ſtill enjoy the warmth of the ſun, and our friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip together; that then they ſhould want no neceſſaries of life, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying all the comforts of it, with their wives, and might repoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with them in peace and ſafety, without any diſturbance.</p>
                                    <p>This he delivered in behalf of all our <hi>Indians,</hi> on this ſide <hi>Suſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanna,</hi> who are all concerned with him in this treaty; and this was all he had to ſay on this ſubject.</p>
                                    <p>He then began again, and laying down a bundle of deer ſkins, ſaid, That now they would diſcourſe of matters of trade between them and us; that hitherto it had been like a houſe with two doors, one for them, the other for the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> but the goods were placed in the dark; ſo that they were wholly ignorant how they had been dealt with, or how they ſhould trade.</p>
                                    <p>He repeated the ſame, laying down a ſecond bundle of ſkins, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired they might be informed of the terms, they might trade upon, that if occaſion were, they might, at any time, ſend their wives, and be out of danger of being cheated.</p>
                                    <p>He added a third bundle of deer ſkins, complaining how hard it was upon them; for that they knew not what they were to expect for their goods, and that they could ſcarce purchaſe ours.</p>
                                    <p>Laying down a fourth bundle, being ſkins and furs, he deſired, that we might be as people, eating all of the ſame diſh, and ſo they might be dealt with, as if they were our own people.</p>
                                    <p>Preſenting a fifth bundle, he ſaid, that formerly they exactly knew the prices both of our goods and theirs; but now they varied ſo much, there was no underſtanding them.</p>

                                    <p>With a ſixth bundle, he ſaid, That through this uncertainty, he wore himſelf ſuch ragged breeches, that he was aſhamed to ſhew them, and deſired this inconveniency might be remedied.</p>
                                    <p>Offering a ſeventh, he complained that they were often impoſed on by the weight of our money, when they came to ſell, that we certainly knew the value of theirs; but they could not underſtand ours; and, therefore, deſired that this great inconveniency might alſo be remedied.</p>
                                    <p>He offered an eighth, informing, that <hi>Opeſſah</hi> (formerly king of the <hi>Shawaneſe,</hi> but now abdicated) lived at a great diſtance, and entertained them with victuals and proviſions, when they went that way; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they deſired, that when he ſhould come among us, he might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as one of themſelves, with the ſame openneſs, that he received from them.</p>
                                    <p>Having ended their diſcourſe, they were told, that to-morrow they ſhould receive anſwers to all they had ſaid; and were, for the preſent, diſmiſſed.</p>
                                    <p>Orders were given to the Mayor of <hi>Philadelphia, Iſaac Norris,</hi> and the Secretary, to take an account of the preſents, now made, and their value; and that goods ſhould be provided, to be ready in the morning; and the ſaid preſents were found to conſiſt of,</p>

                                       <p>That the great <hi>Queen of England,</hi> who had, for ſo many years, reigned with great ſucceſs, was now dead, and was ſucceeded by a King, who has been a great General, in the wars, is a wiſe King, and has more dominions, than any King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> ever had before him; that under him, as well they (the <hi>Indians</hi>) as we, his other ſubjects, may live in the ſame peace, that we have enjoyed any time before; that our Proprietary, their Friend, <hi>William Penn,</hi> is ſtill living, though but weak in health.</p>
                                       <p>That, as to the complaints, they made concerning trade, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor is ſorry he cannot give them a more entire ſatisfaction in it, and  <!-- PB 69 -->
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:034421_0069_0FFD9E51A9191670"/>

remove every hardſhip, which they lie under; but that all trade is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain; our own wheat the laſt year, yielded twice the price, it does this; all our goods, which they buy, are brought from <hi>England,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we alſo ſend theirs; that ſometimes a habit, which is in faſhion one year, is laid aſide the next; and accordingly the ſkins, of which they are made, will be of a higher or lower value. It is the ſame with all our other merchandize, as with thoſe which they buy; their only ſecurity and ſafety will be, to trade with the honeſteſt men, and thoſe of the beſt reputation, and prefer thoſe who will give the moſt; that this is our rule, in all our buſineſs, and they muſt do the ſame.</p>
                                       <p>That <hi>Opeſſah</hi> has long been under a league of friendſhip with us; and though he has now left thoſe <hi>Indians,</hi> among whom he formerly lived, yet we ſhall ſhew him the ſame friendſhip as ever; and ſhall depend upon the ſame from him; and that, upon this further recommendation from them, he will think himſelf as one of them, and under the ſame bond with them; and, therefore, we deſire, that, as he lives at a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and may ſee many foreign <hi>Indians,</hi> he will, from time to time, inform us, if he hears of any thing, which may concern us; and this we deſire, and ſhall expect and depend on from him, and all his friends there; as alſo that, if they know any thing now of any late motions to or from the ſouthward, they would acquaint us.</p>
                                       <p>Concerning which, being particularly aſked, <hi>Opeſſah</hi> affirmed, he knew nothing.</p>
                                       <p>The Governor further ordered, they ſhould be told, That all the ſober <hi>Engliſh</hi> very much lamented that they could not guard themſelves better againſt liquor; that they ſhould ſend their young men abroad to hunt, and, at their return, ſhould ſell their goods for ſuch things as would be of real ſervice to them, and not throw it all away for that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive liquor <hi>rum;</hi> which robbed them, not only of their goods, but of their lives alſo</p>

                     <p>Such has been the King's goodneſs, not only expreſſed in his firſt generous royal declaration, and repeatedly ſince, from the throne, but more powerfully exerted through a moſt wiſe and ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy adminiſtration, in purſuing every meaſure, that might contribute to the ſafety and happineſs of his people; in making the known laws the invaria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rule of his government; in reſtoring the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the <hi>Britiſh nation</hi> abroad; and in procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his ſubjects ſuch advantages, in commerce, as could ſcarce be hoped for, after they had been ſo unhappily given away, that, even, the remoteſt parts of the King's great dominions feel the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign influences of his paternal affection to the whole, and are laid under doubled obligations to make the utmoſt returns of gratitude, as well as obedience, for their happineſs, under his auſpicious reign.</p>

                     <p>When our Proprietary and Governor in Chief, firſt obtained a grant of this province from the crown, and a numerous colony of induſtrious people ſettled therein, we are well aſſured it was his inclination, as well as viſible intereſt, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them as ſafe as poſſible, under his adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>And, as his religious perſuaſion, as a diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the eſtabliſhed <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> was well known, and therefore thoſe of the ſame profeſſion made a great part of the firſt adventurers with him, it cannot be doubted but that he would ever think himſelf obliged to provide that they ſhould enjoy, in <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> at leaſt, equal eaſe and privileges with any other <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſubjects of the ſame rank, in any of the King's dominions.</p>
                     <p>Accordingly when neceſſitated to be abſent from us, as he has, for the moſt part been, he took care, from time to time, to appoint ſuch perſons, to be his deputies, in the government, in whoſe moderation and tenderneſs towards his friends, as well as loyalty to the crown, and juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to all its ſubjects, he believed he might confide.</p>
                     <p>When the Governor, therefore, firſt brought over the Proprietary's commiſſion of deputation, for the government, we could not doubt but that, being the Proprietary's choice, and acting ſolely by powers, derived from him, he would ſteadily purſue the meaſures, that had generally been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, from our firſt ſettlement, and endeavour to make all the ſubjects of the crown, under the Proprietary's government, equally ſecure and eaſy.</p>

                     <p>Nor while the Proprietary's health, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer abilities happily continued, had the inhabitants much reaſon to complain, but that the Governor made the Proprietary's directions, from home, as far as they could be obtained, and the advice of thoſe, the Proprietary had inſtructed here, the rule (in great meaſure) of his conduct, in what related to the Proprietary's intereſt, or govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to the privileges of the people.</p>
                     <p>But whether it be now owing to the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of thoſe orders and directions, which has followed on the late great and melancholy change, in the Proprietary's health, or to ſome unhappy advice from others, or to any new formed views, we know not; but this Houſe of Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, ſoon after their firſt meeting, finding the Governor had, at length, ſo far loſt ſight of the obligations he lay under to his principal and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituent, as to enter on meaſures inconſiſtent with his intereſt, and our conſtitution, and the liberties of the people, we judged it our indiſpenſible duty to apply to the Governor for redreſs; who declaring his opinion to be ſuch as would not admit of any, we deſired, with due ſubmiſſion, that he would be pleaſed to ſuffer the reaſons of that opinion to be argued before him; but finding, to our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that all our endeavours were in vain, we think ourſelves obliged, in the diſcharge of the truſt repoſed in us, fully to repreſent the fatal conſequences, as well as the unreaſonableneſs, of thoſe meaſures, to the end that a proper relief may be obtained; without which the greater part
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:034421_0076_0FFD9EAFABDF7200"/>
of the inhabitants of this province muſt be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered miſerable; which we humbly offer, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:</p>
                     <p>Thoſe, who accompanied the Proprietary in the ſettlement of this colony, being chiefly (as has already been obſerved) of thoſe called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> who, lying under ſome hardſhips, in their native country, becauſe, for conſcience-ſake, they could not comply with the laws there, for taking oaths, expected that, by virtue of the powers of legiſlation, granted by the crown, to the Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and them, they might, after the hazard and toil of their removal hither, be capable of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the privileges of Engliſh ſubjects, without violation of their religious principles.</p>
                     <p>Accordingly the Proprietary and Aſſemblies provided laws, by which thoſe people might be enabled to hold any offices (there being but few others at that time, to fill them) or to give evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in any caſe whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>Some diſputes afterwards ariſing on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the late Queen, by her order, in Council, dated the 21ſt of January, 1702, was pleaſed to extend to this province, the <hi>affirmation</hi> allowed to the <hi>Quakers,</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> by the ſeventh and eighth of <hi>William</hi> the Third, not only for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes intended by that in <hi>England,</hi> but alſo for the qualification of Magiſtrates and officers; and the ſame being from thence applied to other caſes, this order, on the repeal of our own acts, in a great meaſure, ſupplied what was neceſſary, in this point, for the adminiſtration of juſtice.</p>
                     <p>But the act of parliament itſelf being near its expiration, it was found neceſſary, as well on that, as ſome other conſiderations, to eſtabliſh, by an act of the province, the qualifications of officers, and the manner of giving evidence, by affirmation; and the Governor (upon the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly's
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:034421_0077_0FFD9E6F70983F20"/>
performing the conditions propoſed them) paſſed acts for that, as well as other purpoſes, to anſwer the exigencies of the government.</p>
                     <p>That the ſaid affirmation-acts ſhould have full force, according to the intention of them, of ſuch importance to the eaſe and ſecurity of the whole province, that it could ſcarcely be ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, any perſon amongſt us, who profeſſed, even, the moſt ſlender regard for the people's welfare, would attempt to deprive them of the advantages thereof.</p>
                     <p>It is, therefore, the more ſurpriſing, that the Governor himſelf (from whoſe ſtation, and the truſt repoſed in him, by our Proprietary, the moſt tender concern for the ſafety and well-being of all his Majeſty's ſubjects, under his care, might reaſonably be expected) ſhould be the principal, if not the firſt, perſon, in the government, who would render the intention of thoſe acts void to us, though paſſed by himſelf into laws ſo lately before, by publicly declaring his opinions, in ſuch manner, as would render the ſaid acts repugnant to the laws of <hi>England,</hi> and repealed by the act of parliament of the firſt of his preſent Majeſty; in purſuance of which opinion, he has refuſed to qualify ſuch perſons for offices, that could not take the oath, according to the law of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The conſequence of which is, that, as no <hi>Quaker</hi> in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> is qualified, or permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to give evidence, in any criminal cauſes, or ſerve on any juries, or bear any office, or place of profit, in the government; ſo, ſhould the ſame hold, in this colony, not only the great number of the firſt adventurers, with their deſcendants, of the ſame profeſſion, are to be wholly excluded from having any part, or ſhare, in the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of juſtice, and the execution of the laws of the country, (which, as it would be a general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:034421_0078_0FFD9E1A7531BCA0"/>
ſo would it throw the burden too hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily on a few of the inhabitants) but, what is of no leſs importance, for the ſecurity of thoſe of other profeſſions, the greateſt outrages and barbarities, againſt any perſon, may be committed, in the face of any number of <hi>Quakers,</hi> and the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, though brought to trial, muſt eſcape with impunity, for want of legal evidence, if that of the <hi>Quakers</hi> is not to be ſo accounted; of which the Governor cannot forget a very memorable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, when (at a time, that unhappily there was no act of the province, for an <hi>affirmation,</hi> but the Queen's order was thought ſufficient, during that interval, for all but capital caſes) it is preſumed a murderer eſcaped the ſentence, that was due to him, for want of ſuch evidence, as was eſteemed legal, though more than one <hi>Quaker</hi> appeared in court, who were witneſſes to the fact.</p>
                     <p>But, beſides theſe inconveniencies, however great, there remains one further conſequence of that conſtruction of the act, which, perhaps, the Governor is not ſufficiently adviſed of; which is, That, if no <hi>Quaker,</hi> in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> nor the <hi>Plantations,</hi> can bear any office, or place of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, in the government, ſome may judge it a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inference, that the Proprietary himſelf is equally affected by it; and then all powers derived from him, as well thoſe lodged in the Governor, by his deputation, as the magiſtracy and inferior offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, fall together.</p>
                     <p>Having thus far pointed out the deſtructive conſequences of that opinion, ſhould it fully take place in this province, we judge it, in the next place, incumbent on us, in duty to the Governor, and for the diſcharge of the truſt, repoſed in us, by thoſe we repreſent, to offer to the conſideration of the Governor, and all others concerned, ſuch reaſons as have occurred to us, in our enquiry into
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:034421_0079_0FFD9E71E7D864C8"/>
this head; which we hope (with ſubmiſſion) will render it inconteſtibly evident that the affirmation-acts of this province are in full force; and are neither repealed, nor affected by any act of parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, that has come to our knowledge; but that the Governor is obliged to take care that the ſame be equally, with any other act, put duly in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>By the ſame royal charter of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, by which this province, with licence to tranſport an ample colony thereunto, was granted to our Proprietary, and the Governor in Chief, the ſaid King grants to him and his heirs, &amp;c. pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to make laws jointly with the people; and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects the force and limitation of them, in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words, as they ſtand in divers parts of the ſaid charter, but are here collected, <hi>viz,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We, repoſing ſpecial truſt and confidence in the fidelity, wiſdom, juſtice and provident circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of the ſaid <hi>William Penn,</hi> for us and our heirs and ſucceſſors, do grant free, full and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power, by virtue of theſe preſents, to him and his heirs, and their deputies and lieutenants, for the good and happy government of the ſaid country, to ordain, make, enact, and, under his and their ſeals, to publiſh any law whatſoever, for raiſing of money, for the public uſes of the ſaid province, or for any other end, &amp;c. by and with the advice, aſſent and approbation of the freemen of the ſaid country, or the greater part of them, or of their delegates, &amp;c. and the ſame laws duly to execute unto and upon all people within the ſaid country, and limits thereof; which laws, ſo as aforeſaid to be publiſhed, our pleaſure is, and ſo we enjoin, require and command, ſhall be moſt abſolute and available in law: and that all the liege people and ſubjects of us, our heirs and ſucceſſors, do obſerve and keep the ſame inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:034421_0080_0FFDA17576E3C5E8"/>
in thoſe parts, ſo far as they concern them, under the penalties therein expreſſed, or to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, <hi>Provided nevertheleſs,</hi> That the ſaid laws be conſonant to reaſon, and be not repugnant, or contrary, but as near as conveniently may be, agreeable to the laws, ſtatutes and rights of this our kingdom of <hi>England. And our further will and pleaſure is,</hi> That the laws for regulating and governing property, within the ſaid province, as well for the deſcent and enjoyment of lands, as likewiſe for the enjoyment of ſucceſſion of goods and chattels, and likewiſe felonies, ſhall be and continue the ſame as they ſhall be, for the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by the general courſe of the law, in our king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>England,</hi> until the ſaid laws ſhall be alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſaid <hi>William Penn,</hi> his heirs and aſſigns, and by the freemen of the ſaid province, their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates, or their deputies, or the greater part of them. And to the end that the ſaid <hi>William Penn,</hi> his heirs, or others, the planters, owners, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the ſaid province, may not, at any time hereafter, by miſconſtruction of the powers aforeſaid, through inadvertency, or deſign, depart from that faith, and due allegiance, which, by the laws of this our realm of <hi>England,</hi> they, and all our ſubjects, in our dominions and territories, always owe unto us, our heirs and ſucceſſors, &amp;c. <hi>Our further will and pleaſure is,</hi> That a tranſcript or duplicate of all laws, which ſhall be, as aforeſaid, made and publiſhed, within the ſaid province, ſhall, within five years after the making thereof, be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and delivered to the Privy Council, for the time being, of us, our heirs and ſucceſſors; and if any of the ſaid laws, within the ſpace of ſix months, after they ſhall be ſo, as aforeſaid, tranſmitted and delivered, be declared by us, our heirs and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, in our or their Privy Council, inconſiſtent with the ſovereignty, or lawful prerogative of us, our heirs, or ſucceſſors, or contrary to the faith and
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:034421_0081_0FFD9E55115A1F98"/>
allegiance due, by the legal government of this realm, from the ſaid <hi>William Penn,</hi> or of the plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or inhabitants of this province; and that thereupon any of the ſaid laws ſhall be adjudged and declared to be void, by us, our heirs or ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, under our, or their privy ſeal, that then, and from thenceforth, ſuch laws, concerning which ſuch judgment and declaration ſhall be made, ſhall become void, otherwiſe the ſaid laws, ſo tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſhall remain and ſtand in full force, according to the true intent and meaning thereof.</p>
                     <p>Purſuant to theſe powers, the ſaid acts of this province, for an affirmation, were made and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed. And though a conſiderable part of the five years, limited in the charter, is yet unexpired, the ſame have been duly tranſmitted; nor have we heard any thing, but that they are, or may be, well approved of; having reaſon to hope, that they contain nothing, for which (according to the tenor of the ſaid royal charter) they ought to be declared void; and, therefore, are of as full force, as abſolute and available, and to be obſerved and kept as inviolably as any law whatſoever, that can be enacted in this province, and ought accordingly to be as duly executed by the Governor, to the full extent thereof.</p>
                     <p>But the Governor, in anſwer to a reſolution of this Houſe of the 18th of October laſt, which was, That the royal charter makes the acts of this province moſt abſolute and available in law, until repealed by the King, is pleaſed to ſay, That he joins with the Aſſembly, in this reſolve, provided the laws are not repugnant to the laws of <hi>England;</hi> and by the following paragraph, in the ſame an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, which is, That he allows the laws of the province had ſettled the qualifications of Magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates and other officers, until the publication of the act of King <hi>George,</hi> relating thereto, he has,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:034421_0082_0FFD9E3C7522E7C0"/>
at laſt, thought fit to give ſo much under his hand, as his opinion, the natural conſtruction whereof is, that the ſaid affirmation-acts of this province (being the ſubject then in hand) were repugnant to the laws of <hi>England,</hi> and repealed by the ſaid act of parliament.</p>
                     <p>But this we humbly offer, That, if it muſt be termed repugnant, becauſe it differs from, or is not the ſame with, the act of parliament, then the clauſe of the royal charter, which grants pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the Governor and Aſſembly here to alter the laws of <hi>England,</hi> for the deſcent of lands, enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſtates, and puniſhing felonies, in the province (as is above recited from the ſaid charter) appears to be uſeleſs and vain.</p>
                     <p>But it is further to be conſidered, That, as the term <hi>repugnant,</hi> always implies an abſolute oppoſition, or contrariety, in matter, it cannot be ſaid that an act of this province, which ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles thoſe, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> to ſerve in offices, upon juries, and to be evidence, in all caſes (the circumſtances of the country requiring that it ſhould be ſo) is contrary to an act of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> which enables them only to give evidence in civil caſes; theſe two differ, it is true, and ſo it was certainly conſidered and expected, at the time of the royal grant, that our acts might, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, differ from thoſe in <hi>England;</hi> otherwiſe thoſe in <hi>England</hi> would ſuffice; and no ſuch power for altering them needed to have been granted: on the contrary, the act of this province, purſuant to the directions of that royal charter, is as nearly agreeable, as to our conveniency may be, to the ſtatute provided for <hi>Quakers,</hi> in <hi>Great Britain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the Governor, we preſume, could not intend, by his anſwer, That this act, at the time of paſſing it, was repugnant to any of the laws of <hi>England,</hi> though it differed from them, for in
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:034421_0083_0FFD9E3DF7D42CE0"/>
that, certainly, he could not have given it his ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it muſt, therefore, be meant, that it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>repugnant</hi> only ſince the ſuppoſed publication of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> act, which he conceives repealed it; or, to ſtate what can be alledged on that head, in its full force, and the plaineſt terms it will bear, that the act of the firſt of king <hi>George,</hi> entitled, <hi>An act for making perpetual an act of the ſeventh and eighth years of the reign of his late Majeſty, King William the Third,</hi> entitled, An act, <hi>That the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn affirmation and declaration of the people called Quakers, ſhould be accepted inſtead of an oath, in the uſual form,</hi> &amp;c. extends to this province that act of King <hi>William,</hi> by theſe words in the laſt clauſe of it, viz. <hi>Provided always,</hi> That ſo much of this act, as relates to the affirmations to be made by the people called <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to that part of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> called Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, for ever, and to the plantations belonging to the crown of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> for five years, &amp;c. Therefore, that, as the <hi>Quakers</hi> are not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by that act, in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> to hold offices, ſerve on juries, or be evidence in criminal caſes, ſo, by its being extended to the plantations, they are as effectually diſabled there, and that all acts of this province, for qualifying <hi>Quakers,</hi> in theſe caſes, are, by the ſuperior force of this act of parliament, repealed, and made utterly void.</p>
                     <p>But when the language of the act itſelf comes to be conſidered, the whole ſeeming force of this objection will, we preſume, entirely diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; the clauſe of limitation, in the ſeventh and eighth of <hi>William</hi> the Third, is in theſe words: <hi>"Provided, and be it enacted, That no Quaker, or reputed Quaker, ſhall, by virtue of this act, be qualified or permitted, to give evidence, in any cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal cauſes, to ſerve on any juries, to bear any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, or place of profit, in the government, any thing in this act contained to the contrary notwithſtanding."</hi>
                        <pb n="84" facs="unknown:034421_0084_0FFD9EB3448F5FA8"/>
Upon which we conceive that Brigadier <hi>Hunter,</hi> Governor, under his Majeſty, of the provinces of <hi>New York</hi> and <hi>New Jerſey,</hi> has (in a caſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel with ours) obſerved, in his printed declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on that ſubject, under the title of, "An anſwer to what has been offered, as argument againſt the validity and force of an act of Aſſembly, entitled, <hi>An act, that the ſolemn affirmation and declaration of the people called Quakers,</hi> &amp;c. paſſed in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>New Jerſey,</hi> in the thirteenth year of the reign of Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> to be of ſuch force, as to be worthy our recital: in which, after he has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, in general, in the following words:— "Into what a woful condition muſt the planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be plunged, if ſuch laws as ſhall, by a Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlature lawfully conſtituted by virtue of letters patent, under the broad ſeal, be enacted for the good government and eaſe of the ſubjects there, ſhall, by implication, or conſtruction, be deemed to be repealed!" &amp;c. he is pleaſed to ſay, that act of Aſſembly is not ſo much as, by implication, repealed; for the words of that act, upon which they lay the ſtreſs of the argument, are theſe, <hi>Provided, that no Quaker ſhall, by virtue of this act, be qualified,</hi> &amp;c. Now I know no <hi>Quaker,</hi> continues that gentleman, that pretends he is, or can, by virtue of that act, be qualified; but I believe every <hi>Quaker</hi> thinks that he is, or may be, qualified by an act of Aſſembly, entitled, An act, that the ſolemn affirmation and declaration of the people called <hi>Quakers,</hi> &amp;c. paſſed in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and ſent home, &amp;c. It is as plain as words can make it, that that act, of the ſeventh and eighth of King <hi>William,</hi> has no negative, but upon itſelf, and conſequently cannot be alledged in bar to any laws already enacted, in the plantations, or even ſuch as may be enacted; for, by theſe letters patent, which gave a being to this govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Legiſlature, all ſuch laws, as ſhall be
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:034421_0085_0FFD9E754F4A98B8"/>
enacted by the Governor, Council and Aſſembly, are declared to be in full force, from the time of enacting.</p>
                     <p>The ſame worthy gentleman and Governor is further pleaſed, in the ſaid print, to publiſh an inſtruction from the late Queen, in whoſe reign that act of Aſſembly was made, directing him to paſs ſuch an act in <hi>New Jerſey;</hi> by which inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion her Majeſty was pleaſed further to declare her will and pleaſure, "That ſuch of the people called <hi>Quakers,</hi> as ſhall be found capable of ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in her Council, the General Aſſembly, and in other places of truſt and profit, in <hi>New Jerſey,</hi> and accordingly be elected, or appointed, to ſerve therein, may, upon their taking and ſigning the declaration of allegiance to her Majeſty, in the form, uſed by the ſame people, in <hi>England,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a ſolemn declaration of the true diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their reſpective truſts, be admitted by the Governor to any of the ſaid places or employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments." And he adds, "That the ſame inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are, word for word, alſo contained in his preſent Majeſty's inſtructions to the Governor, dated the firſt of July, 1715. By which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that both the late Queen was, and his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Majeſty is, willing that the people called <hi>Quakers,</hi> immediately under their government, in <hi>New Jerſey,</hi> ſhould enjoy the full privileges, which are craved here, as due to the people, we repreſent, by their charteral rights, under the government of our Proprietary, <hi>William Penn.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this we may add what has alſo been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, on the ſame ſubject, by the Chief Juſtice of <hi>New Jerſey,</hi> in his ſpeech, delivered at the ſupreme court, in May laſt, at <hi>Burlington,</hi> which is alſo printed; wherein he clearly gives his opinion in law, very nearly in the ſame terms, the Governor
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:034421_0086_0FFD9E41F141CD60"/>
had done before, and then proceeds, in theſe words, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The act of parliament of <hi>Great Britain</hi> is an enlargement of the <hi>Quakers</hi> privileges to what it never was before; it makes that perpetual to them, in <hi>England,</hi> which before was temporary and expired, or near expiring, by its own limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, carries the ſame into that part of <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> called <hi>Scotland,</hi> where it was not before, and makes it perpetual there, and into the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, generally, for five years. This does no way hinder, but that, by virtue of the act of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the province (which is a municipal law thereof) the <hi>Quakers,</hi> or reputed <hi>Quakers,</hi> are qualified to be of juries and evidence, and bear offices of truſt and profit, in the government; nor, but that they may be ſo qualified hereafter, by any other law, hereafter to be made, for that, or the like purpoſe, although by virtue of that act of parliament, they are not ſo qualified.</p>
                     <p>Having thus far ſtated this point, we ſhall now leave it; but that we are obliged to give the ſenſe of this Houſe to that part of the Governor's anſwer to our reſolves, in which he is pleaſed to ſay, That though he was of opinion he could not be ſafe in giving any qualification but an oath, yet by a <hi>dedimus</hi> they, (the officers and witneſſes) might have been qualified, as the law directs.</p>
                     <p>On which we muſt humbly obſerve, That though it may be very certain a <hi>dedimus poteſtatem,</hi> duly iſſued by the Governor, is no leſs ſufficient, in law, for adminiſtering qualifications to any officer, than the Governor's act, in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; which, notwithſtanding, the Governor has not of late, that we know of, condeſcended to, but refuſed to admit ſuch of thoſe called <hi>Quakers,</hi> as, by virtue of the Proprietary's charter to the people, were elected to ſerve in certain offices,
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:034421_0087_0FFD9E63695344F8"/>
until that more remarkable caſe of the laſt quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Mayor of <hi>Philadelphia;</hi> yet no ſuch <hi>dedimus</hi> will anſwer the exigencies of this government, ſhould the Governor's opinion ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: for ſhould it be taken for granted, that the affirmation-act of this province is actually repealed by the act of parliament, then all ſuch qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will be conſtrued illegal, whether given by himſelf, or other perſons, empowered by him. And as the Judges of the ſupreme court have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered their reaſons to the Houſe, for their not proceeding to try the criminals, now in the reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive gaols of this province, viz. <hi>That they cannot think it prudent to proceed, by virtue of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or's commiſſion to them, in oppoſition to his opinion, in ſo tender a point, as the lives of his Majeſty's ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:</hi>

                     <p>It has, by this time, we hope, clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, from what has been offered, That the opinion of the Governor is (with ſubmiſſion) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther founded on law nor reaſon; but from hence we cannot but deſire the Governor may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced more ſeriouſly and maturely to conſider how unaccountable and aſtoniſhing it muſt appear to mankind, that, while ſuch perſons as Governor <hi>Hunter,</hi> who holds his commiſſion directly from the crown, is accountable to no other principal, nor under obligations to any called a <hi>Quaker,</hi> as a ſuperior, has thought it neceſſary, in the diſcharge of his truſt, to publiſh his reaſons, in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, for removing miſtakes, and allaying the diſturbances from thence fomented; at the ſame time, though ſuch an example be ſet to us, at no greater diſtance, than the other bank of <hi>Delaware,</hi> our <hi>Proprietary, William Penn</hi>'s Lieutenant, in the
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:034421_0088_0FFD9E1DD044AC40"/>
province of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> ſhould be drawn into meaſures ſo injurious, not only to the intereſt of his principal, from which he derives his power, but to the very being of the conſtitution, over which he is entruſted to preſide. We heartily wiſh we could, by any conſtruction, find other cauſes, to which theſe procedures might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, than a formed deſign; but we are juſtly alarmed at ſome other late proceedings of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, which, as they have naturally fallen under our notice, we think ourſelves alſo obliged, in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to repreſent:</p>
                     <p>When the Houſe had choſen their Speaker, and the Governor, without any objection, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved their choice, they proceeded to take the uſual qualifications as the law, in that caſe, directs; but upon the rumours, that had been ſpread, of perſons diſaffected to his preſent Majeſty, that this Houſe might give the utmoſt expreſſions, they could, of their loyalty, they, by a meſſage to the Governor, requeſted to know, if beſides what they had taken as uſual, the Governor had any directions from <hi>Great Britain,</hi> or any other qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification to offer to the Houſe; to which, he was pleaſed to anſwer, <hi>he had not:</hi> the Houſe notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding reſolved to neglect no part of their duty, but to give all the aſſurances of their loyalty, in their power, thought fit unanimouſly to take and ſubſcribe the teſt, called the <hi>abjuration,</hi> every one, in the way preſcribed to them by the ſeveral acts of parliament, according to their religious perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and then proceeded to the buſineſs before them.</p>
                     <p>But being informed that the Governor had, at divers times, and to ſundry perſons, charged the preſent Mayor of the city of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> now Speaker of the Houſe, as a perſon diſaffected to his Majeſty, King <hi>George;</hi> and that he further
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:034421_0089_0FFD9E67A88FF4F8"/>
alledged, the only cauſe of difference betwixt him and the ſaid Mayor, was, becauſe the Governor would not agree to proclaim the Pretender, or words to the ſame effect; the Houſe conceived themſelves obliged, in duty to his ſaid Majeſty, to enquire into the grounds of this heinous charge, that, in caſe there ſhould be any found<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they might purge themſelves of the ſcandal.</p>
                     <p>Accordingly, having, in a committee of the whole Houſe, taken full proofs, that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or had ſo charged the Speaker, and finding, by the ſame evidence, that he had, in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, alſo charged <hi>James Logan,</hi> Secretary of the province, they, by a meſſage, deſired of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, that he would be pleaſed to lay before the Houſe his grounds for theſe accuſations; but he returned no other anſwer, than, "That he thought himſelf not obliged to render any reaſons to the Houſe for his accuſation, but would do it at the board at home;" and the Members, ſent on the meſſage, could not perſuade him to give any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons here.</p>
                     <p>The Houſe thereupon judged it ſtill the more incumbent on them to enquire fully into the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and accordingly they, by a written meſſage, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the Governor, That, being under a deep concern, on all occaſions, to ſhew their loyalty, as faithful ſubjects, to King <hi>George,</hi> they could, by no means, think themſelves diſcharged of their duty, without further enquiring into the truth of the report, which they had received, and acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Governor with, which affected their Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and another perſon, bearing conſiderable offices and truſts, in the government; and finding the Governor's anſwer to the laſt meſſage, concerning the ſame, not ſatisfactory, they further acquainted him, that the Houſe intended immediately to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve into a committee, in order to enquire into
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:034421_0090_0FFD9EABB54CCA68"/>
that matter, and that the ſaid committee would be deſirous to receive from the Governor, or any other perſon, any information concerning the ſame, in order to proceed to the extent of what is their duty, and purge the Houſe of any Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or Members thereof, that may appear, or ſhall be found guilty of diſloyalty to the King, or diſaffection to his government, under which the Houſe unanimouſly declared themſelves extremely happy, and well ſatisfied.</p>
                     <p>But the Governor, though another meſſage was ſent to him, to crave his anſwer, could not be prevailed on to give any, but that he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to lay before them; the Houſe notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, while formed into a committee for that purpoſe, proceeded to make the utmoſt enquiries, in their power; but could not find the leaſt ground to ſuſpect the perſons charged, or to believe the accuſations, againſt them, had any manner of foundation.</p>
                     <p>Now what ſentiments can be formed of ſuch a conduct, in a perſon, acting in ſo exalted a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Houſe muſt acknowledge themſelves to be at a loſs to determine! But the Houſe would conſider it, as no ſmall happineſs to the whole province, could they be aſſured that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or had no deſign, by his repreſentations to any board, at home, to raiſe a merit to himſelf, on the ruin of others; who, could they be heard there, and f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>lly known, might be found as faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and loyal, in their ſtations, to the preſent eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment and ſucceſſion, as any of the King's ſubjects whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>Had the Governor believed the Speaker to be ſuch a perſon, as he has thought fit to render him, it was doubtleſs incumbent on the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to except againſt him, when firſt preſented by the Houſe, in that ſtation, or had he ſuſpected either
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:034421_0091_0FFD9E98D80060F0"/>
the Speaker, or any other Member, to be diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to the King, it might be no leſs expected, that he ſhould have recommended to the Houſe, the further qualification of the <hi>abjuration,</hi> as a teſt to them: but, if the Speaker of the Houſe of Repreſentatives of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> and others acting in the great truſts, are to be rendered to the miniſtry, or to any board, as perſons ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly diſaffectd, as the Governor's charges im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and this without the leaſt proof offered here, though ſo importunately, and yet dutifully ſolicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it will force all thinking perſons on apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that there is more intended by it, than can ſafely be acknowledged here, where things and perſons are better known, than can poſſibly be at ſuch a diſtance, as the other ſide of the ocean.</p>
                     <p>Having proceeded to ſuch a length, on theſe two important ſubjects, we ſhould now chuſe to bring this <hi>repreſentation</hi> to a period, but that the Governor's written anſwer to another meſſage from the Houſe exacts our notice; in which he is pleaſed to ſay, That he is given to underſtand, (for which he thinks fit to quote the language of former Aſſemblies, and ſome of the Council) that this Houſe did not deſign to make laws, nor raiſe any money this ſeſſion, but upon terms inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with the Governor's duty and ſafety to comply with.

<pb n="92" facs="unknown:034421_0092_0FFD9E92B1B21390"/>
we ſhould have any other bills to offer, that might be for the intereſt and tranquillity of the people, he ſhould be ready to paſs them, and promiſed himſelf, that he would make a return ſuitable to their circumſtances, and the advantages they will receive by them: but, in his next written meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, he informed the Houſe, "That he diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed from both the Council and Aſſembly, in his opinion, upon a point of ſuch importance to the ſecurity, as well as tranquillity of the people, that no bill of ours can be of more to us:" the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of which was, that he declared (in oppoſition to both Council and Aſſembly) that one of the laſt laws, he himſelf had paſſed, which moſt near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected us, was void, and this by conſtruction only; we could not, therefore, find any encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement from the Governor's propoſals to us, to think any other bill, we could offer, was worth the ſoliciting, and much leſs deſerving, a further conſideration.</p>
                     <p>To this we muſt not omit adding, That we find judgment was given againſt one <hi>Hugh Lowdon,</hi> at the court of common pleas, in September laſt, whereupon the ſaid <hi>Hugh Lowdon,</hi> giving way to the greateſt reſentment and rage, vowed revenge, at the utmoſt hazards, againſt the aforeſaid Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Secretary (being two of the Juſtices of that court) and having furniſhed himſelf with piſtols, way-laid them, at their doors, and meeting the Speaker, the ſame night, he preſented at him a piſtol loaden with bullets; although, by the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling hand of Providence, no further miſchief enſued. As this attempt could not but raiſe a horror in the hearts of all good men, we find the ſaid <hi>Lowdon</hi> was bound over to the court, now ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and indictments were ſound againſt him, for the ſame; at which the Governor, inſtead of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting the Magiſtrates, in the diſcharge of their
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:034421_0093_0FFD9ECD664FE450"/>
truſts, has now thought fit to grant <hi>Noli Proſequi</hi>'s, in the ſaid <hi>Lowdon</hi>'s favour, in the ſame manner he had formerly done, for one <hi>Francis Phillips</hi> (that ſcandal to his order) when indicted and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted for notorious crimes, after all the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring clergy had diſowned him. Which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, as they rendered the adminiſtration con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, ſo we alſo juſtly fear they will encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage ill-minded men to the ſame attempts, in hopes of the like favour.</p>
                     <p>But, to ſum up the whole, we can truly ſay, we are extremely troubled, that we cannot enjoy the ſame happineſs, that moſt of our neighbours reſpectively do, of ſeeing our Governor take ſuch meaſures, as ſhould, by an agreeable force, ſway the people's inclinations, to render him eaſy, in all reſpects; which can be effected by no means ſo powerfully, as firſt rendering them eaſy, in the enjoyment of thoſe privileges, which they have an undoubted right to: and we are but too well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that the only cauſe of a failure herein, is the Governor's miſtake, ſince the Proprietary's indiſpoſition, in the choice of his adviſers; who, whatever views they may, at preſent form, will, at length, be found the ſole occaſion of all the diſappointments, that may fall to the Governor's portion; for, even, though acting by commiſſion, immediately from the crown, he would have the ſame injured people to deal with.</p>

               <p>"Some of you can very well remember ſince <hi>William Penn,</hi> and his friends, came firſt to ſettle among you, in this country: it is but a few years, and like as yeſterday, to an old man; nevertheleſs, by following that great man's peaceable counſels, this government is now become wealthy and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, in great numbers of people. And though many of our inhabitants are not accuſtomed to war, and diſlike the practice of men killing one another; yet you cannot but know, I am able to bring ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral thouſands into the field, well armed, to defend both your people and ours, from being hurt by any enemy, that durſt attempt to invade us.</p>
               <p>"However, we do not forget that <hi>William Penn</hi> often told us, that the experience of old age, which is true wiſdom, adviſes peace; and I ſay to

you, that the wiſeſt man is alſo the braveſt man: for he ſafely depends on his wiſdom; and there is no true courage without it.</p>

I am but juſt now returned from <hi>Virginia;</hi> where I wearied myſelf, in a long journey, both by land and water, only to make peace for you, my children, that you may ſafely hunt in the woods, without danger, from <hi>Virginia,</hi> and the many <hi>Indian Nations,</hi> that are at peace with that government. But the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of <hi>Virginia,</hi> expects, that you will not hunt within the great mountains, on the other ſide of <hi>Potowmack</hi> river; being a ſmall tract of land, which he keeps for the <hi>Virginia Indians,</hi> to hunt in: and he promiſes that his <hi>Indians</hi> ſhall not come any more on this ſide <hi>Potowmack,</hi> or behind the great mountains this way, to diſturb your hunting. And this is the condition I have made for you; which I expect you will firmly keep, and not break it on any conſideration whatſoever.</p>
               <p>"I deſire that what I have now ſaid to you may be interpreted to the Chiefs of the Five Nations preſent: for as you are a part of them, they are, in like manner, one with us, as you yourſelves are; and, therefore, our counſels muſt agree, and be made known to one another: for our hearts ſhould be open, that we may perfectly ſee into one another's breaſts. And that your friends may ſpeak to me freely, tell them I am willing to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the miſtakes, which ſome of their young men were guilty of, amongſt our people. I hope they will grow wiſer with age, and hearken to the grave counſels of their old men; whoſe valour we eſteem, becauſe they are wiſe; but the raſhneſs of their young men is altogether folly."</p>

               <p>"Gheſaont, in the name, and on the behalf of all the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> delivered himſelf, in ſpeaking to the Governor, as follows:</p>
               <p>"They were glad to ſee the Governor, and his Council at this place; for they had heard much of the Governor, in their towns, before they came from home; and now they find him to be what they had then heard of him, <hi>viz.</hi> their friend and brother, and the ſame as if <hi>William Penn</hi> were ſtill amongſt them.</p>
               <p>"They aſſure the Governor and Council, that they had not forgot <hi>William Penn</hi>'s treaties with them; and that his advice to them was ſtill freſh in their memories.</p>
               <p>"Though they cannot write, yet they retain every thing, ſaid in their councils, with all the nations they treat with; and preſerve it as carefully in their memories, as if it was committed, in our method, to writing.</p>
               <p>"They complain, that our traders, carrying goods and liquors up <hi>Suſquehanna</hi> river, ſometimes
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:034421_0133_0FFD9F6D0A58A6B0"/>
meet with their young people, going out to war, and treat them unkindly, not only refuſing to give them a dram of their liquor, but uſe them with ill language and call them dogs, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>"They take this unkindly; becauſe dogs have no ſenſe, or underſtanding: whereas they are men, and think that their brothers ſhould not compare them to ſuch creatures.</p>
               <p>"That ſome of our traders calling their young men by theſe names, the young men anſwered; "If they were dogs, they might act as ſuch;" whereupon they ſeized a cag of liquor, and ran away with it."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>N. B.</hi> This ſeems to be told in their artful way, to excuſe ſome ſmall robberies, that had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by their young people.</p>
               <p>"Then laying down a belt of wampum upon the table, he proceeded and ſaid,</p>
               <p>"That all their diſorders aroſe from the uſe of rum, and ſtrong ſpirits; which took away their ſenſe and memory; that they had no ſuch liquors among themſelves; but were hurt with what we furniſhed them; and therefore deſired that no more of that ſort might be ſent among them.</p>
               <p>"He produced a bundle of dreſſed ſkins and ſaid,</p>

               <p>"Preſents another bundle of raw ſkins, and obſerves,</p>

now be ſo well cleaned, as to remain brighter and ſtronger, than ever it was before.</p>

               <p>"That, as, in the firmament, all clouds and darkneſs are removed from the face of the ſun, ſo they deſire that all the miſunderſtandings may be fully done away; ſo that when they, who are now here, ſhall be dead and gone, their whole people, with their children and poſterity, may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the clear ſun-ſhine of friendſhip with us for ever; without any thing to interpoſe, or obſcure it.</p>
               <p>"Preſents another bundle of ſkins, and ſays,</p>
               <p>"That, looking upon the Governor, as if <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Penn</hi> was preſent, they deſire, that, in caſe any diſorders ſhould hereafter happen between their young people and ours, we would not be too haſty in reſenting any ſuch accident, until their council and ours can have ſome opportunity to treat amicably upon it; and ſo to adjuſt all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as that the friendſhip between us may ſtill be inviolably preſerved.</p>

               <p>"He proceeds and ſays,</p>
               <p>"That they conſider themſelves, in this treaty, as the full plenipotentiaries and repreſentatives of the <hi>Five Nations;</hi> and they look upon the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, as the great King of <hi>England</hi>'s repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative: and, therefore, they expect that every thing now ſtipulated will be made abſolutely firm and good, on both ſides.</p>
               <p>"Preſents a bundle of bear ſkins, and ſays,</p>

               <p>"Preſenting a few furs, he ſpeaks only as from himſelf, to acquaint the Governor,</p>
               <p>"That the <hi>Five Nations</hi> having heard that the Governor of <hi>Virginia</hi> wanted to ſpeak with them, he himſelf, with ſome of his company, intended to proceed to <hi>Virginia,</hi> but do not know the way, how to get ſafe thither.</p>

               <p>"At a Council, held at <hi>Coneſtogoe,</hi> July 8th, 1721. P. M.</p>
               <p>"Preſent, the ſame as before; with divers gentlemen attending the Governor, and the Chiefs of the <hi>Five Nations;</hi> being all ſeated in council, and the preſents laid down before the <hi>Indians,</hi> the Governor ſpoke to them, by an interpreter, in theſe words:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>"My Friends and Brothers,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>"It is a great ſatisfaction to me, that I have this opportunity of ſpeaking to the valiant and wiſe <hi>Five Nations</hi> of <hi>Indians,</hi> whom you tell me, you are fully empowered to repreſent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="unknown:034421_0136_0FFEA855EDDCBCE8"/>"I treat you, therefore, as if all theſe nations were here preſent; and you are to underſtand, what I now ſay, to be agreeable to the mind of our great Monarch, <hi>George,</hi> the King of <hi>England,</hi> who bends his care to eſtabliſh peace amongſt all the mighty nations of <hi>Europe;</hi> unto whom all the people, in theſe parts, are, as it were, but like one drop, out of a bucket, ſo that what is now tranſacted between us, muſt be laid up, as the words of the whole body of your people and our people, to be kept in perpetual remembrance.</p>
               <p>"I am alſo glad to find that you remember what <hi>William Penn</hi> formerly ſaid to you. He was a great and a good man: his own people loved him; he loved the <hi>Indians,</hi> and they alſo loved him. He was as their father; he would never ſuffer them to be wronged; neither would he let his people enter upon any lands, until he had firſt purchaſed them of the <hi>Indians.</hi> He was juſt, and therefore the Indians loved him.</p>
               <p>"Though he is now removed from us; yet his children and people, following his example, will always take the ſame meaſures; ſo that his and our poſterity will be as a long chain, of which he was the firſt link; and when one link ends, another ſucceeds, and then another; being all firmly bound together in one ſtrong chain, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure for ever.</p>
               <p>"He formerly knit the chain of friendſhip with you, as the chief of all the <hi>Indians,</hi> in theſe parts; and leſt this chain ſhould grow ruſty, you now deſire it may be ſcoured, and made ſtrong, to bind us, as one people, together. We do aſſure you, it is, and has always been, bright on our ſide; and ſo we will ever keep it.</p>
               <p>"As to your complaint of our traders, that they have treated ſome of your young men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly, I take that to be ſaid only by way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:034421_0137_0FFD9F02AB7B2250"/>
for the follies of your people, thereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to perſuade me, that they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to do what you very well know they did; but, as I told our own <hi>Indians,</hi> two days ago, I am willing to paſs by all theſe things; you may therefore be aſſured, that our people ſhall not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any injury to yours; or, if I know that they do, they ſhall be ſeverely puniſhed for it. So you muſt, in like manner, ſtrictly command your young men, that they do not offer any injury to ours. For when they paſs through the utmoſt ſkirts of our inhabitants, where there are no people yet ſettled, but a few traders, they ſhould be more careful of them, as having ſeparated themſelves from the body of their friends, purely to ſerve the <hi>Indians</hi> more commodiouſly with what they want.</p>
               <p>"Nevertheleſs, if any little diſorders ſhould, at any time, hereafter ariſe, we will endeavour that it ſhall not break, or weaken, the chain of friendſhip between us: to which end, if any of your people take offence, you muſt, in that caſe, apply to me, or to our chiefs. And when we have any cauſe to complain, we ſhall, as you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, apply to your chiefs, by our friends, the <hi>Coneſtogoe Indians:</hi> but, on both ſides, we muſt labour to prevent every thing of this kind, as much as we can.</p>
               <p>"You complain, that our traders come into the path of your young men, going out to war, and thereby occaſion diſorders among them; I will, therefore, my friends and brothers, ſpeak very plainly to you, on this head.</p>
               <p>"Your young men come dawn <hi>Suſquehanna</hi> river, and take their road through our <hi>Indian</hi> towns and ſettlements, and make a path between us and the people, againſt whom they go out to war. Now, you muſt know, that the path, this
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:034421_0138_0FFEA8D9E363C4C8"/>
way, leads them only to the <hi>Indians,</hi> who are in alliance with the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and firſt, to thoſe, who are in a ſtrict league of friendſhip with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of <hi>Virginia;</hi> juſt as theſe, our friends and children, who are ſettled among us, are in league with me and our people.</p>
               <p>"You cannot therefore make war upon the <hi>Indians,</hi> in league with <hi>Virginia,</hi> without weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the chain with the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> for, as we would not ſuffer theſe, our friends and brothers of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtogoe,</hi> and upon the river, to be hurt by any perſons, without conſidering it, as done to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; ſo the Governor of <hi>Virginia</hi> looks upon the injuries, done to his Indian brothers and friends, as if they were done to himſelf. And you very well know, that, though you are five different nations, yet you are but one people; ſo as that any wrong, done to one nation, is receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as an injury, done you all.</p>
               <p>"In the ſame manner, and much more ſo, it is with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who are all united under one great King, who has more people, in that one town, where he lives, than all the <hi>Indians,</hi> in <hi>North America,</hi> put together.</p>
               <p>"You are in league with <hi>New York,</hi> as your ancient friends, and neareſt neighbours; and you are in league with us, by treaties, often repeated, and by a chain, which you have now brightened. As, therefore, all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are but one people, you are actually in league with all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, and muſt equally preſerve the peace with all, as with one government.</p>
               <p>"You pleaſed me very much, when you told me, that you were going to treat with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of <hi>Virginia.</hi> Your nations formerly entered into a very firm league with that government; and, if you have ſuffered that chain to grow ruſty, it is
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:034421_0139_0FFD9F1F95D7F310"/>
time to ſcour it; and the Five Nations have done very wiſely to ſend you there for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>"I do aſſure you, the Governor of <hi>Virginia</hi> is a great and a good man; he loves the <hi>Indians,</hi> as his children, and ſo protects and defends them; for he is very ſtrong, having many thouſand Chriſtian warriors under his command; whereby he is able to aſſiſt all thoſe, who are in any league of friendſhip with him. Haſten, therefore, my friends, to brighten and ſtrengthen the chain with that great man; for he deſires it, and will receive you kindly. He is my great and good friend; I have been lately with him; and ſince you ſay, you are ſtrangers, I will give you a letter to him, to inform him of what we have done, and of the good deſign of your viſit to him, and this country.</p>
               <p>"My friends and brothers, I told you two days ago, that we muſt open our breaſts to each other; I ſhall, therefore, like your true friend, open mine yet further to you, for your good.</p>
               <p>"You ſee that the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> from a very ſmall people, at firſt, in theſe parts, are, by peace amongſt themſelves, become a very great people amongſt you, far exceeding the number of all the <hi>Indians,</hi> we know of.</p>
               <p>"But while we are at peace, the <hi>Indians</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to make war upon one another; and deſtroy each other, as if they intended that none of their people ſhould be left alive; by which means you are, from a great people, become a very ſmall people; and yet you will go on to deſtroy your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>"The <hi>Indians</hi> of the ſouth, though they ſpeak a different language, yet they are the ſame people, and inhabit the ſame land, with thoſe of the north. We, therefore, cannot but wonder, how you, that are a wiſe people, ſhould take delight in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:034421_0140_0FFEA882260AC500"/>
an end to your race: the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> being your true friends, labour to prevent this. We would have you ſtrong, as a part of ourſelves: for, as our ſtrength is your ſtrength, ſo we would have yours to be as our own.</p>
               <p>"I have perſuaded all my brethren, in theſe parts, to conſider what is for their good; and not to go out any more to war; but your young men, as they come this way, endeavour to force them. And becauſe they incline to follow the counſels of peace, and the good advice of their true friends, your people uſe them ill, and often prevail with them to go out, to their own deſtruction. Thus it was, that their town of <hi>Coneſtogoe</hi> loſt their good King, not long ago; and thus many have been loſt. Their young children are left without pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; their wives without huſbands; the old men, contrary to the courſe of nature, mourn the death of their young; the people decay, and grow weak; we loſe our dear friends, and are afflicted. And this is chiefly owing to your young men.</p>
               <p>"Surely, you cannot propoſe to get either riches, or poſſeſſions, by going thus out to war: for when you kill a deer, you have the fleſh to eat, and the ſkin to ſell; but when you return from war, you bring nothing home, but the ſcalp of a dead man; who, perhaps, was huſband to a kind wife, and father to tender children, who never wronged you; though, by loſing him, you have robbed them of their help and protection; and, at the ſame time, got nothing by it.</p>
               <p>"If I were not your friend, I would not take the trouble of ſaying all theſe things to you; which I deſire may be fully related to all your people, when you return home, that they may conſider in time, what is for their own good. And, after this, if any will be ſo madly deaf and blind, as neither to hear nor ſee the danger before them, but will
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:034421_0141_0FFD9EF8B8F52D40"/>
go out to deſtroy, and be deſtroyed, for nothing, I muſt deſire that ſuch fooliſh young men would take another path, and not paſs this way, amongſt our people, whoſe eyes I have opened; and they have wiſely hearkened to my advice. So that I muſt tell you plainly, as I am their beſt friend, and this government is their protector, and as a father to them, we will not ſuffer them any more to go out, as they have done, to their deſtruction. I ſay again, we will not ſuffer it; for we have the counſel of wiſdom amongſt us, and know what is for their good. For though they are weak, yet they are our brethren; we will therefore take care of them, that they be not miſled with ill counſel. You mourn when you loſe a brother; we mourn, when any of them are loſt; to prevent which they ſhall not be ſuffered to go out, as they have done, to be deſtroyed by war.</p>
               <p>"My good friends and brothers, I give you the ſame counſel, and earneſtly deſire that you will follow it, ſince it will make you a happy people. I give you this advice, becauſe I am your true friend; but I much fear you hearken to others, who never were, and never will be, your friends.</p>
               <p>"You know very well, that the <hi>French</hi> have been your enemies, from the beginning; and though they made peace with you twenty-two years ago, yet, by ſubtle practices, they ſtill endeavour to enſnare you. They uſe arts and tricks, and tell you lies, to deceive you; and if you would make uſe of your own eyes, and not be deluded by their jeſuits and interpreters, you would ſee this your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: for you know they have no goods of any value, theſe ſeveral years paſt, except what has been ſent to them from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of <hi>New York,</hi> and that is now all over. They give fair ſpeeches, inſtead of real ſervices; and as, for many years, they attempted to deſtroy you in war, ſo they now
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:034421_0142_0FFEA8DBB963C9A8"/>
endeavour to do it in peace; for when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade you to go out to war againſt others, it is only that you may be deſtroyed yourſelves; which we, as your true friends, labour to prevent; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we would have your numbers increaſe, that you may grow ſtrong, and that we may be all ſtrengthened in friendſhip and peace together.</p>
               <p>"As to what you have ſaid of trade, I ſuppoſe the great diſtance, at which you live from us, has prevented all commerce between us and your peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. We believe thoſe, who go into the woods, and ſpend all their time upon it, endeavour to make the beſt bargains they can, for themſelves; ſo, on your part, you muſt take care to make the beſt bargains you can with them. But we hope our traders do not exact; for we think that a ſtrowd coat, or a pound of powder, is now ſold for no more buck ſkins than formerly. Beaver, indeed, is not, of late, ſo much uſed in <hi>Europe;</hi> and, therefore, does not give ſo good a price; and we deal but very little in that commodity. But deer ſkins ſell very well among us; and I ſhall always take care that the <hi>Indians</hi> be not wronged. But, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept other meaſures be taken to regulate the <hi>Indian</hi> trade every where, the common method uſed in trade will ſtill be followed; and every man muſt take care of himſelf; for thus I muſt do myſelf, when I buy any thing from our own people; if I do not give them their price, they will keep it; for we are a free people. But if you have any further propoſals to make about theſe affairs, I am willing to hear and conſider them; for it is my deſire that the trade be well regulated to your content.</p>
               <p>"I am ſenſible rum is very hurtful to the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> we have made laws, that none ſhould be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried amongſt them; or, if any is, that it ſhould be ſtaved, and thrown upon the ground; and the
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:034421_0143_0FFF580BAB9AFAA8"/>
Indians have been ordered to deſtroy all the rum, that comes in their way, but they will not do it; they will have rum; and when we refuſe it, they will travel to the neighbouring provinces and fetch it; their own women go to purchaſe it, and then ſell it amongſt their own people, at exceſſive rates. I would gladly make any laws to prevent this, that could be effectual; but the country is ſo wide, the woods are ſo dark and private, and ſo far out of my ſight, if the <hi>Indians</hi> themſelves do not prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit their own people, there is no other way to prevent it; for my part, I ſhall readily join in any meaſures, that can be propoſed, for ſo good a purpoſe.</p>
               <p>"I have now, my friends and brothers, ſaid all, that I think can be of ſervice, at this time, and I give you theſe things here laid before you, to confirm my words, <hi>viz.</hi> Five coats, twenty pounds of powder, forty pounds of lead, for each of the <hi>Five Nations;</hi> that is, twenty-five coats, one hundred pounds of powder, and two hundred pounds of lead, in the whole; which I deſire may be delivered to them, with theſe words, in my name, and on behalf of this province: I ſhall be glad to ſee often ſome of your chief men, ſent in the name of all the reſt; and deſire you will come to <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> to viſit our families, and our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren born there, where we can provide better for you, and make you more welcome; for people always receive their friends beſt at their own houſes. I heartily wiſh you well on your journey, and good ſucceſs in it. And when you return home, I deſire you will give my very kind love, and the love of all our people, to your kings, and to all their people.</p>
               <p>"Then the Governor roſe from his chair; and when he had called <hi>Gheſaont,</hi> the ſpeaker, to him,

               <p>The Houſe, in anſwer, as kindly acknowledged the Governor's care, and conſtant inclinations, for the good and proſperity of the province; and, joining with them, in ſentiment, reſpecting the neceſſary things, which he recommended to their conſideration, they undertook the regulation and improvement of ſome of the law proceedings; eſpecially reſpecting attachments; and ſeveral laws were paſſed, for theſe purpoſes.</p>
               <p>About this time the province appears to have been under great difficulties,<note place="margin">Scheme for a paper cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency firſt introduced into Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, 11th mo. 1722.</note> reſpecting the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, or diſcouragement, of its trade and credit, and the want of a ſufficient medium, or currency, of caſh; for the relief of which divers propoſals were made; and among the reſt, that of <hi>paper money,</hi> or <hi>paper bills of credit,</hi> was now intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; which occaſioned conſiderable debate, between men of different ſentiments, reſpecting it.</p>
               <p>The Governor was a ſtrong advocate for a <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per currency,</hi> and took great pains to promote it; with whom appeared to join the generality of the people.

                                 <p>We beg leave to lay before you ſome conſiderations, in anſwer to the <hi>ſentiments of ſeveral gentlemen and merchants,</hi> in relation to a <hi>paper cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit</hi> which they were admitted to preſent, the tenth inſtant.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is but juſt to concede to their notion, that this province is dependent on, and derives all its powers from, <hi>Great Britain;</hi> and that it is the higheſt wiſdom, in our Legiſlature, to direct themſelves by the ſame prudent meaſures, as far as our circumſtances with theirs may agree.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is by them alledged, that when the nation was diſtreſſed by war, and their coin generally debaſed, yet the parliament would not advance their currency, on any account; and that they renewed it, at the ſame fineneſs, to paſs at the former rates; and they have unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly kept to the ſame. And further, that <hi>twelve hundred thouſand pounds</hi> made good to private perſons all their loſs, received from exchanging their clipped and debaſed coin, for the new milled money, delivered at par: to which we ſay, that we know (by what authority ſoever it was, or is done) that ſince, if not then, the coin hath been (particularly the gold) often raiſed and lowered; and that the <hi>twelve hundred thouſand pounds</hi> did make good all the loſs in the kingdom, for the debaſed coin, is an aſſertion, we doubt not, but there are many, in <hi>Great Britain</hi> (and ſome here) can inform thoſe gentlemen otherwiſe.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In concurrence with the ſentiments of theſe gentlemen, in their third paragraph, we humbly recommend it to our legiſlators, that our bills be eſtabliſhed upon ſo juſt a foundation, that, while in being, they may ſtill continue of the ſame value with real money, according to the rates, at which they are firſt iſſued.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If thoſe bills cannot be procured, where they are to be iſſued, for a leſs pledge or ſecurity, than gold, or ſilver, would be, the eaſy terms of refunding them will not leſſen their value; for the ſtamp of authority has its own laws, as unalterable in themſelves, as thoſe of intereſt, or increaſe, are in uſury; and which, ſuch as are verſed in thoſe affairs, as carefully conſider.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The ſchemes moſt commonly talked of, for lending out ſums to be diſcharged by annual payments, equal to, or not much exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the intereſt, for a certain number of years, without paying any prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, are not partial and unjuſt, nor deſtructive to the public credit; for the pledge ſecured is more than an equivalent to the ſum received, and the intereſt given is not inconſiderable, even, of the loweſt rated ſchemes. To whom are they partial and unjuſt, ſince no method is propoſed, or contrived, for any particular man, or men, excluding others? The benefit is to be general; and though the neceſſities of the poor chiefly call for the ſuccour, yet it is more within the compaſs of the rich to be thereby fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured; becauſe they have plenty of pledges: let them not, then, complain of partiality, or injuſtice, through their own negligence. How are ſuch ſchemes deſtructive to public credit, ſince the public is capable of yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much relief to a neceſſitous people, without hurting itſelf? No, the deſign is laudable, and greatly becomes our generous <hi>patriots.</hi> But, perhaps, there are ſome, that are partial to themſelves, although they ſeem to ſpeak in defence of the public, affording us room to gueſs, they would have no money borrowed, but of private perſons, and begrudge the borrowers of the public, the gain of near <hi>thirty pounds,</hi> according to the exquiſite calculation of thoſe gentlemen; becauſe they themſelves know, that ſuch an advantage is not equal to the ſweet incomes of uſury.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi>Sixthly,</hi> All ſuch projects are not exceedingly weak and unjuſt; for what man, had he money by him to lend, would refuſe it, on ſufficient ſecurity? And if he does lend it, on ſuch ſecurity, where can we ſuppoſe the lender's loſs to be? Or, wherein is the paper credit leſſened, when there is more than its value to ſupport it? Their ſuppoſing it to be lent to all, is an amuſement; and the tribunal is eaſy to be erected, to find out perſons of worth, from thoſe that are worth nothing; and the poor (who, they ſay, have as little merit as any) may have a chance to get it by labour, by the employers having ſomething to pay both to their own, and the poor man's advantage: and thus a way may eaſily be found for diſpenſing the public favours. We preſume to add, to theſe great and rich men (and, therefore, according to their account, ſober and induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men) that we humbly hope a medium, in buſineſs, will run us from the looſe way of luxury, idleneſs and folly, which often, happens from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>non-plus'd</hi> in a regular diſpatch of affairs, for want of pay, when due.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi>Seventhly,</hi> This currency, or paper money, will not fall in value, it raiſed on a good foundation, as recommended in the third article. The riſe of ſilver is alone owing to the avarice of the poſſeſſor; who, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there is no other currency (and that too, at this time, extremely ſcarce) they have impoſed on the neceſſities of the people, by advancing it near <hi>two ſhillings</hi> in the pound; but it is not improbable that our bills, being always capable of purchaſing our country produce, their value be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equal to ſilver, will again reduce it to its ſtated worth, and be a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                       <desc>•</desc>
                                    </gap> ſatisfactory to the kind lender, who, (according to them) relieved the borrower in diſtreſs, or ſold him land, or goods, at the real value, at the time of lending, or ſale.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Thoſe do not deceive themſelves, who, becauſe gold and ſilver may be had, at <hi>New York,</hi> or other places, in exchange for their paper money, ſuppoſe that the one is as good as the other. It is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived maxim, that the value of any thing is in proportion to what it will purchaſe: now paper bills will, at this time, and would formerly, purchaſe, in <hi>New York,</hi> goods cheaper than caſh will, at <hi>Philadelphia;</hi> and it is obvious that ſome other reaſon may have occaſioned the riſe of ſilver and gold there; ſince we have here advanced, at leaſt, <hi>ſix pence</hi> per ounce, on ſilver, beyond the rate aſcertained by act of parliament, without any ſuch motive as paper money.</p>
                                 <p>Theſe being premiſed on the general heads, what next follows is in anſwer to their three concluſive points.</p>
                                 <p n="1">1ſt. If the whole ſum ſtruck be ſo ſmall, that it will not anſwer the abſolute and immediate neceſſities of thoſe who have real ſecurities to give, it will not (we humbly conceive) be ſufficient to paſs from hand to hand, for a currency.</p>
                                 <p n="2">2d. That which is a benefit to any perſon, for five years, will be a further benefit, for a longer term; and, perhaps, the fixing it to a ſhort date may abridge ſome perſons from effecting what they might accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh for their own good, and the country's advantage, in more time. The difficulty of exchanging worn out bills for new, in an office to be erected for that purpoſe, we doubt not the care and ability of this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly to ſurmount, and render practicable. And, if our laws can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in force no longer than five years, without the royal approbation, yet we preſume a law ſo beneficial to the ſubject here, ſo concurrent to the practice of neighbouring colonies, and no ways repugnant to the laws of <hi>England,</hi> will, when duly repreſented at home, not want that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.</p>
                                 <p n="3">3d. We confide in this, that the wiſdom of this <hi>honourable Houſe</hi> needs no direction, in the care to be taken, of ſinking the <hi>paper currency</hi> in courſe, and in a juſt manner; for we eſteem you (and not theſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen petitioners) to be proper judges of the methods hitherto diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of.</p>
                                 <p>Theſe obſervations, may it pleaſe this honourable Houſe, on the ſentiments of thoſe gentlemen, we humbly offer to your conſideration, and pray your favourable conſtruction.</p>

                           <p>Soon after the preceding anſwer was delivered to the Houſe, it was followed by a paper, in reply to it, containing, <hi>the further ſentiments of the gentlemen, merchants,</hi> &amp;c. on the ſame ſubject, <hi>viz.</hi>

                                    <note place="margin">Further ſentiments, &amp;c.</note>In the important affair of a <hi>paper credit,</hi> now under the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your Houſe, it is to be hoped that all honeſt men, amongſt us, think of it from the ſame principles, and with the ſame inclinations, <hi>viz.</hi> to promote the true intereſt and reputation of this colony.</p>
                                 <p>Upon theſe views alone we lately took the liberty to petition your honourable Houſe, to be heard upon the ſubject, and the next day ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited our ſentiments, in writing, drawn into ſeveral heads, and built, on ſuch ſolid foundations of truth, that we are well aſſured they cannot be ſhaken.</p>
                                 <p>Yet, as the opinions of men are extremely various, and great pains have, of late, been taken here, to inſtil and ſtrengthen popular errors, on that ſubject; we find divers of theſe drawn up, in a paper, lately preſented to, and received by, the Houſe; containing, as it ſays, ſome conſiderations, in anſwer to our ſaid ſentiments, but truly conſiſting, in a great meaſure, of thoſe common miſtakes, which have unhappily oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned ſuch differences in opinion, even, among the well-meaning, who, we preſume, all aim at the public good.</p>
                                 <p>The more clearly, therefore, to manifeſt theſe popular deceptions, to prevent the unhappy conſequence, that may attend their obtaining further place, and more effectually to eſtabliſh the truth and certainty of thoſe heads, we before preſented, we humbly beg leave to offer the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing obſervations, on the ſeveral parts of that paper, with ſome <hi>fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſentiments,</hi> on the whole matter; which, we hope, will be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted according to their true intention, that is, to ſerve the public, in which we are all jointly embarked.</p>
                                 <p>The deſign of what we then exhibited to the Houſe (as is evident from all the parts of it) was not to oppoſe a <hi>paper credit,</hi> but to ſhew the danger of ill concerted ſchemes, and to point out, as far as was then proper, what we conceived to be the moſt effectual meaſures, for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering all the juſt ends, propoſed by ſuch a credit.</p>
                                 <p>In the three firſt articles was repreſented how much it became us, as a government depending on Britain, to copy after the great examples, their parliaments have ſet before us; particularly theſe two caſes of keeping our coin conſtantly to the ſame rates, and ſupporting the credit of our bills, when iſſued, equivalent to ſuch money.</p>
                                 <p>To the firſt of theſe, thoſe, concerned in that paper, are obliged to concede.</p>
                                 <p>To the ſecond they anſwer with a groſs miſtake, and an unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing trifling: for, it is poſitively true, that ſince the great reformation of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> coin, in 1696, there has not been the leaſt alteration in it; <hi>guineas,</hi> which, till lately, never were a legal tender, were limited that year, that they ſhould not, under a penalty, be received at more than <hi>twenty-two ſhillings</hi> each. But no ſooner did <hi>ſilver,</hi> the true lawful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of the kingdom, circulate freely again, which, by the great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the ſeveral mints, they did, within ſix months after; but the people refuſed to take them at more than <hi>twenty-one ſhillings and ſix pence,</hi> as formerly; at which rate they have conſtantly continued, till the mines of <hi>America,</hi> eſpecially of <hi>Braſil,</hi> producing much more gold than ſilver, in value, the firſt has fallen, in <hi>Europe;</hi> on which, to prevent the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of ſilver, they are, by a late act of parliament, reduced to <hi>twenty-one ſhillings;</hi> and at that rate, at length, made a legal tender, that is, lawful money of the nation. If foreign gold, or ſilver, be meant, which are only merchandize, and riſe, as the demand is for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation, theſe are entirely out of the queſtion. To the other part, where they alledge, that the <hi>twelve hundred thouſand pounds</hi> did not make good all the loſs, in the kingdom; we ſay, that our informations are as good as any can pretend to, in this province.</p>
                                 <p>That ſum, on large trials, made in the exchequer, of the monies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the year before, was judged ſufficient to make good the whole loſs; and all, who brought in their money, within the time limited, had it made good to them. It is true, ſome perſons diſaffected to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and others fond of their hoards, forbore, and ſuffered accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, but the great care of the parliament, and therefore the truth of our aſſertion, are from hence equally clear.</p>
                                 <p>The third head, which is the greateſt point, of keeping up our bills to the ſame value with real money, according to the rates, or which they are, at firſt, iſſued, is alſo conceded, in general terms; and the juſt foundation mentioned, is all that is contended for.</p>
                                 <p>But what is advanced in the fourth and fifth articles, is the grand popular error, that endangers a diſappointment, in that great end pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. For no ſtamp of authority can give an intrinſic worth, where it really is not. Experience, whoſe inſtructions, even the weakeſt may reach, will ſhew us, that bills of credit have been iſſued in no place on this continent, where they have not, ſooner or later, ſunk below the value, at which they were, at firſt, made; and yet they all had as pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful a ſtamp of authority as any we can give. We are now upon put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in practice a project of the ſame kind; it is, therefore, the more highly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                 <p>The firſt remark, we offered, on this head, was from this founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that, if the public, by their terms of iſſuing their bills, ſhew they eſtimate them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

This is moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and plain to any man of reaſon, who will make uſe of it: but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons over-run with the common notions, depending on the applauſe of ſuch as are ready prepared to give it to every thing, favouring their own opinions, may think it ſufficient for anſwering the moſt certain truth, barely to deny it, and confide in the numbers, that are to ſupport their aſſertions; which we conceive has been the only motive to thoſe perſons, who drew up, or preſented the paper, now under conſideration; but the unhandſome reflections, that are caſt, in that part of it, ſhall, for the preſent, be waved, and referred to the cloſe of this, as a more proper place.</p>
                                 <p>In our fifth and ſixth heads we aſſerted, that ſuch ſchemes as were then commonly talked of, were partial, weak and unjuſt; as they were intended to make grants very beneficial to the firſt borrower, but injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the others: that all would equally covet the ſame advantage; but that, from the nature of the thing, all could not poſſibly partake of it; unleſs the quantity of the bills were ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                       <desc>•</desc>
                                    </gap>aſt as to render them of little, or no value. The truth of all which is ſo clear and plain, that it would be little leſs than a mockery to human reaſon, to offer arguments for ſupporting what, if underſtood, is ſelf-evident. But this is now entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of time, the wiſdom of the Aſſembly having admitted none of thoſe ſchemes, there guarded againſt, and it will be difficult to find a reaſon for offering that part of the paper to the Houſe, after all the votes, that have been paſſed on this affair, unleſs it be to prepare, with an extreme modeſty, for another puſh, to overſet all that has hitherto been voted.</p>
                                 <p>Their whole anſwer to the ſeventh head is grounded on another great miſtake, in the cauſe of the riſe of ſilver amongſt us; which is truly thus: In the year 1709, when the act of parliament, for reducing our coin, took place, ſilver was our common currency; gold being then but rarely ſeen; but as it was judged neceſſary (ſeeing the act was ſilent in it) to make that alſo, as well as ſilver, paſs current by weight, at ſome determinate rate; and being, at that time, worth four pounds an ounce, or four ſhillings per penny weight, in <hi>Britain,</hi> it was advanced in the ſame proportion with ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, (<hi>viz.</hi> one third) to <hi>five ſhillings and four pence</hi> per penny weight; but becauſe this ſum could not be ſo divided by twenty-four, as to render it practicable to reckon ſingle grains by farthings, without a fraction, it was, by common conſent, raiſed to <hi>five ſhillings and ſix pence,</hi> that a grain might be accounted at <hi>two pence three farthings.</hi> This ſeeming ſmall difference, with the advance given in <hi>England</hi> by the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for <hi>Spaniſh ſilver,</hi> wrought ſo great a change in our currency, that our payments were moſtly made in gold, <hi>New York and Britain</hi> gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally exhauſting our ſilver; inſomuch that, even, nine or ten years ago, five per cent. advance was given, in gold, in exchange for <hi>Spaniſh ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;</hi> though afterwards, upon a greater importation of the latter, this difference, for ſome time, abated; but gold having ſtill further fallen in value, in <hi>Britain,</hi> the diſparity has again further increaſed; for account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pieces of eight, only at <hi>five ſhillings and four pence</hi> per ounce, which is under a medium for their common price; and gold at <hi>three pounds eighteen ſhillings,</hi> which is near its preſent, or late value, in <hi>England;</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                       <desc>•</desc>
                                    </gap> ounce of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſilver is truly equivalent to <hi>ſeven ſhillings and ſix pence,</hi> in gold, at <hi>five pounds ten ſhillings</hi> per ounce, as we rate it. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, neither <hi>avarice,</hi> nor <hi>ſharping,</hi> that has occaſioned this advance, in the exchange of theſe two metals, but the eſſential difference, in their intrinſic value, at the market, to which they are carried; which is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated by rules, that ever will prevail among competent reaſoners on the baſis of trade; though ſuch, as go beyond their <hi>laſt,</hi> will meddle with matters out of their ſphere, are uncapable of comprehending them.</p>
                                 <p>But, from hence a ſure rule may be taken, in relation to paper that by ſo much as the value of public bills ſink, by ſo much will gold and ſilver riſe, in proportion to their intrinſic worth; as we find our ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver has done, in proportion to our gold; and the conſtant ſtandard, to meaſure this by, will be the exchange between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> colony, where they are made current, and <hi>Great Britain.</hi> From hence the loſs on bills is to be eſtimated in all places, where they paſs: the exchange in <hi>New York,</hi> before the bills fell, <hi>viz.</hi> in 1716, was <hi>fifty</hi> per cent. and in <hi>Boſton,</hi> not long before; but ſince 1717, the year they uttered their laſt great quantity of bills, it aroſe to <hi>ſixty-five</hi> per cent. and in <hi>Boſton,</hi> it is now near <hi>one hundred and fifty</hi> per cent. as in <hi>Carolina,</hi> it is from <hi>five to ſix cents</hi> advance on <hi>one hundred pounds ſterling.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>The anſwer to the eighth is of a piece with the reſt, a preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous denial of a poſitive truth, that is in itſelf inconteſtible; for the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the <hi>New York</hi> bill runs thus, <hi>viz.</hi> for a bill of <hi>twenty ſhillings; "This bill, of two ounces ten penny weight of plate, due from the colony of New York to the poſſeſſor thereof, ſhall be equal, in value, to Seville pillar,</hi> or <hi>Mexico plate,"</hi> &amp;c. And yet that very bill ſhall, at this time, purchaſe very little more, (if any thing) in pieces of eight, than <hi>two ounces.</hi> It is, therefore, undeniably true, that ſuch a bill is not equivalent to <hi>two ounces and a half</hi> of ſuch plate; becauſe, being fallen from its firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended value, it will not purchaſe ſo much: and it is really ſurpriſing how any men, in direct contradiction to common ſenſe, can amuſe themſelves and others with ſuch groundleſs notions. The price of goods at <hi>New York,</hi> whether cheaper or dearer, than at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> is out of the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; unleſs it could be alledged, that a bill of <hi>twenty ſhillings</hi> will pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe as much of thoſe goods, as can be bought with the real weight of <hi>two ounces and a half</hi> of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſilver; which the boldeſt aſſertor will ſcarce venture to affirm.</p>
                                 <p>We further beg leave to obſerve, on their anſwer to the three laſt articles:</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi>Firſt,</hi> That to ſupply the want of a medium for commerce is the honeſt intention of the propoſal for <hi>bills of credit,</hi> and not to diſcharge the debts of thoſe who want means, from the public, to get clear of them.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi>Secondly,</hi> All bills, bonds, &amp;c. on an equal ſecurity, are the more valued, the ſooner they become due; and the ſooner public bills are to ſink, the greater will be their credit. It is true, that the longer the time is, the more eaſy it may ſeem to the firſt borrower; but, in the whole courſe of the bills, after their ſecond payment, this will but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh their credit. If <hi>eight</hi> years be preferable to <hi>five,</hi> becauſe of the length of the time, the ſame argument may be urged for <hi>ſixteen</hi> or <hi>twenty.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is extremely mannerly (we grant) to leave it entirely to the Aſſembly, to conſider the manner of ſinking the bills; but this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance, it is doubted, is more owing to an unconcernedneſs in that point, when, or whether ever, they ſink, provided they are once obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than to any real modeſty; otherwiſe, it was certainly a breach of that, after the Houſe had voted both the ſum and the time, not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in their wiſdom, but to ſolicit an enlargement.</p>
                                 <p>We pay as great a deference, may it pleaſe the Houſe, to the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative authority, as any others; yet we well know their wiſdom will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence them to lend conſtantly an open ear to all neceſſary hints from without doors, that may contribute any advantage to the important af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, brought from time to time, under their conſideration.</p>
                                 <p>From hence it is, that we ſhall yet crave liberty to offer our further ſentiments, not only in relation to a paper credit, but upon ſome other points, that nearly concern the proſperity of this colony.</p>
                                 <p>Such bills, we find, have been iſſued in <hi>America,</hi> on two different, foundations; the one has been to raiſe a large ſum immediately, on the credit of future taxes, duties, &amp;c. by which they were to be regularly ſunk in time; the other to be lent out on ſecurities, and to be ſunk by the borrowers repaying them into the treaſury. Thoſe of <hi>New York</hi> and <hi>South Carolina</hi> were by the firſt method, and thoſe of <hi>New England.</hi> and <hi>Rhode Iſland,</hi> by the ſecond.</p>
                                 <p>In <hi>Carolina</hi> they were obliged, for the defence of their town and country, againſt ſome threatened invaſions, to raiſe an immenſe ſum, for ſo ſmall a colony, vaſtly exceeding the occaſions they had for a currency, eſpecially ſince their <hi>rice,</hi> which foreigners come to carry away, will purchaſe moſt of the goods they want; and this ſunk the credit of their bills to the low ſtate they were depreſſed to. In <hi>New York,</hi> their firſt bills, raiſed by the ſame method, <hi>viz.</hi> by anticipating the duties, by which they were to be ſunk again, kept up their credit; and, becauſe of the certainty of their terminating, and the quantity being moderate, for a place of ſuch large and extended commerce, they continued of equal value with their current ſilver, until the year 1717, when they iſſued another large ſum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for a longer term; upon which their credit im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately fell to a diſparity with their real money.</p>
                                 <p>Farther to the caſtward, their bills being iſſued on loans only, by which method they cannot be called in, with ſo much certainty, they conſequently fell more than one third below the value, at which they were firſt ſtruck; and the ſame may be expected from the like meaſures to happen here; for ſeeing very few borrowers are found to diſcharge their mortgages to private perſons, in time, and according to contract, it will be expected that the public, to whom ſuch loud cries are raiſed, for ſuccour to the diſtreſſed, will rather be more indulgent, than ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous, to their humble ſuppliants.</p>
                                 <p>It will, therefore, be evident, that to keep up the credit of bills, the quantity muſt be moderate, and ſhould be ſomewhat under a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency for a circulating currency, that we may, as they do in <hi>New York,</hi> contrive means to ſupply ourſelves with ſome quantities of caſh, which is real treaſure in a country, while bills are no more than borrowing from one another without adding one penny to the wealth or ſtock of the colony; and next, that a certainty of their being ſunk in a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time, will principally contribute to ſupport that credit.</p>
                                 <p>It was obſerved before, in the laſt article, preſented by us, to the Houſe, that ſuch meaſures ought to be taken for this, as ſhall render it abſolutely neceſſary for the public, that the bills ſhall be ſunk regularly.</p>
                                 <p>It is therefore, upon the whole, with all due ſubmiſſion, propoſed to the conſideration of the Houſe, whether it may not be rather requiſite to retrench the quantity, laſt voted, than to augment it, as ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; conſidering that <hi>ten pounds</hi> of that currency will probably cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate more and faſter than <hi>twenty</hi> or <hi>thirty</hi> of gold or ſilver; becauſe the latter has a conſtant intrinſic value, while the other, more ſubject to change, and deſigned only for a medium of commerce, will be more briſkly ſhifted from hand to hand, to anſwer that pupoſe? and whether the following methods of applying it may not render it more ſerviceable; <hi>viz.</hi> that, ſeeing the public is now, by the Treaſurer's account, beſides ſome other ſums not yet ſettled, above <hi>one thouſand ſix hundred pounds</hi> in debt, and the ſupport, for the enſuing year, is yet to be provided for, a ſum of about <hi>three thouſand pounds,</hi> to be paid out of the bills, to be ſunk, by an exciſe, or ſuch other method as the Houſe ſhall beſt approve of, for returning that ſum, in three, four or five years, as ſhall be judged moſt convenient.</p>
                                 <p>That a ſum, ſufficient to finiſh the <hi>priſon and workhouſe</hi> of <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia,</hi> be lent out of the bills of the city and county, to be returned into the treaſury, by a yearly tax on the inhabitants, not exceeding one <hi>penny per pound,</hi> till the ſaid ſum be diſcharged; the preſent taxes of <hi>three pence per pound</hi> being too heavy, in theſe difficult times, for the public to bear.</p>
                                 <p>That the reſt be lent out, as is already propoſed to the Houſe, on good unqueſtionable ſecurities, at the intereſt agreed on; but, for the better aſſuring their ſinking, that all public monies, raiſed by any taxes, exciſe, or duties whatſoever, be paid into the reſpective treaſuries only in that ſpecie, to be there ſunk; and the full value of ſuch public monies be made good out of the ſums, paid in by the borrowers, whether in coin, paper, or country produce, to anſwer the ends, for which the ſame was raiſed; by which means the bills muſt neceſſarily be ſunk, and the payments be duly made by the borrowers, without any excuſe or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
                                 <p>That, for the more effectual ſupport of the credit of the bills, <hi>ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence in the pound</hi> be allowed to the perſon, who pays them in, as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic money, to be made good out of the intereſt, paid by the borrower.</p>
                                 <p>Theſe meaſures, may it pleaſe the Houſe, it is believed, will very much contribute to anſwer the juſt ends, propoſed by the bills, with the leaſt injury, or loſs, to the receivers.</p>
                                 <p>The reflections, in this laſt paper, as well as others, which have induſtriouſly been rendered popular, ſhall be anſwered, by ſhewing, from the ſtate of the country, how deſtructive to its true intereſt that ſpirit is, to which too many appear to have reſigned themſelves, that thoſe, who are ſincerely well affected to the public, may, with a more diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing judgment, obſerve the meaſures, by which our common intereſt may be moſt effectually promoted; for which end, we beg leave to add the following remarks, <hi>viz.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>That this ſmall colony, conſiſting, at preſent, only of three coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and of no extraordinary ſoil, ſituate but on one ſide of one naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble river; is, therefore, inferior, in natural advantages, to all others around us; and having no produce, but what other colonies, more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly ſituated, not only rival us in, but, of late, have outdone us, we cannot, therefore, equally flouriſh with others, unleſs we compenſate theſe natural defects, by ſuch improvements, in induſtry, and other good qualities, as may deſervedly acquire us a reputation.</p>
                                 <p>That the huſbandman and merchant are the principal ſupporters of the colony, from whom all other kinds of buſineſs, among us, receive their encouragement; the one raiſing the produce, and the other export<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it by navigation.</p>
                                 <p>That, by the common methods of our trade, for want of a vent abroad, for our wheat, and what is manufactured from it, we can never become conſiderable; and therefore it is neceſſary that the countryman ſhould endeavour for ſome other improvements, and the merchant labour to find out new channels for commere, by purſuing it in all the branches, that may lie open to us, in other countries; for both theſe will ever, in reality, have a natural dependence on each other.</p>
                                 <p>That it is an unhappineſs to this country, that there are not more wealthy men in trade, who, by large ſtocks, could force ſuch an extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed commerce, as in <hi>New York</hi> and <hi>Boſton;</hi> for by theſe means more ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and therefore, more workmen and people would be employed; and both a greater exportation and conſumption of the country produce, to the encouragement of the farmer, would be occaſioned by it.</p>
                                 <p>That it has ever been accounted a great advantage to a country, to have men in it, who can ſupply others with money, in their neceſſities, on ſuch terms as the laws approve; for, from ſuch opportunities, the induſtrious and ingenious, who, for want of ſomething in their hands, might be ever tied down to poverty, may find means to raiſe themſelves (as many have done) to fortunes and a capacity of being extremely uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; from hence many have received vaſt advantages, by compaſſing bargains, that otherwiſe they muſt, forever have gone without. In ſhort, there is nothing more equitable than that the active and induſtrious ſhould, for a moderate conſideration, have the uſe of other men's ſtocks, who either for want of ſkill, or inclination, cannot employ it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                                 <p>That the wealth of a country conſiſts of the riches of its inhabi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tants, and the richer any country is, the better it is for a poor man to live in. All theſe being unqueſtionable truths, it is as aſtoniſhing to conſider, while we have ſcarce one man in the country, that can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted rich, when compared with divers in other colonies; while the province really ſuffers for want of more men of ability, to promote its intereſt, and enlarge its commerce; on which great numbers of the people have their dependance; while money can ſcarce be had on any terms, to lend, or borrow, and ſeldom ever could be obtained on loan, but by entreaty, and with ſolicitation; it is aſtoniſhing, we ſay, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how it is poſſible, that there ſhould be any amongſt us, who, is deſpite of common ſenſe, will ſuffer themſelves to be miſled into ſuch a ſpirit of malignity, as, in direct oppoſition to the intereſt of the whole, to inſult and abuſe thoſe few, in the place, who are the moſt capable of promoting that intereſt; to return reproaches for what was obtained by prayer; and under the endearing appearance of popularity, to ſtrike at the very ſinews of a country's ſtrength, and the evident means of its proſperity; in which all would, according to their ranks, be more or leſs partakers.</p>
                                 <p>We humbly crave the Houſe's excuſe for theſe obſervations, which the unhappy prevailing humour of the time (as the honourable Houſe, from the laſt, and other applications, cannot but be ſenſible) has ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered neceſſary, for rectifying the diſtempered notions of the miſguided. On which no better advice (we conceive) can be recommended to ſuch perſons, than that of the apoſtle, viz, <hi>"To fellow after the things, which make for their peace; to ſtudy to be quiet, and to do their own buſineſs,"</hi> &amp;c. as he has recommended.

And further, by the ſum of <hi>twelve hundred thouſand pounds,</hi> made good to private perſons all the loſs of exchanging their clipped and debaſed coin, for the new milled money, which was delivered out at a par to them: ſo the like juſtice and prudence requires, that no further alteration, than what the parliament has made here, ſhould, on any terms, be admitted, in the value of our gold and ſilver, but that it ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, as it now paſſes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="155" facs="unknown:034421_0155_0FFD9F7311043B50"/>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That, as the parliament, as often as they found it neceſſary to iſſue bills of credit, called exchequer bills, or notes, took the utmoſt ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e to keep them equal in value with ſilver, by giving the <hi>Bank of England,</hi> when they fell into any diſcount, vaſt ſums of money, to receive thoſe bills, as their own, and to exchange them with ready caſh, on the demand of the bearer: ſo it appears abſolutely neceſſary, that if bills of credit be raiſed here, due care ſhould be taken (ſince we can have no ſuch <hi>banks,</hi> in this province, as are in <hi>Europe,</hi> whoſe rules are to pay down ready money for their bills, upon demand) to eſtabliſh them on ſo juſt a foundation, that, while in being, they may ſtill continue of the ſame value with real mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, according to the rates, at which they are at firſt iſſued.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="156" facs="unknown:034421_0156_0FFD9F27F69315A8"/>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That, if thoſe bills be iſſued on any eaſier terms to the receiver, than gold, or ſilver would be, if it were to be paid, or lent, out of the treaſury, by how much eaſier theſe terms are, by ſo much, at leaſt, will the bills fall in value; for credit has its own laws, as unalterable in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as thoſe of motion, or gravity, are, in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and which, ſuch, as are verſed in theſe affairs in <hi>Europe,</hi> as carefully conſider.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That the ſchemes moſt commonly talked of, for lending out ſums, to be diſcharged by annual payments, equal to, or not much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, the intereſt, for a certain number of years, without paying any principal, are partial and unjuſt, and would be deſtructive to public credit; bacauſe the conſideration given is not an equivalent to the ſum received.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="157" facs="unknown:034421_0157_0FFD9EDEE0CEA6B0"/>For inſtance, ſhould <hi>one hundred pounds</hi> be lent out, to be diſcharged, by the payment only of eight pounds annually, for ſixteen years; were ſuch an annuity to be bought, according to the known rules for purchaſing eſtates, it would here be worth no more than <hi>ſeventy pounds ſixteen ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and three pence,</hi> in ready money; nor is an annuity for nine pounds ten ſhillings per annum, for twelve years, worth more than <hi>ſeventy-one pounds twelve ſhillings.</hi> In either of theſe caſes, the borrower, could he diſcharge debts of that value with it, though he were to pay the annuity in gold and ſilver, would gain near thirty pounds by the loan, but no other perſon would feel the leaſt advantage by it; now, if no man would let out his own money on theſe terms, none ought to deſire it ſo of the public; the credit of which is of vaſtly greater importance, than any private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; becauſe a failure, in that, affects the fortune of every individual, in his money, the medium of his commerce and dealing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="158" facs="unknown:034421_0158_0FFD9F5BC78CC510"/>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That all ſuch projects are either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly weak, or unjuſt; for the paper money is to be lent either to all, who ſhall deſire it, on a tender of the ſecurity, propoſed, or to ſome only: if to all (as it is natural for all men to deſire what they may gain by) it will be impracticable to ſtrike enough, to anſwer all demands; or, if it were ſtruck, it would, becauſe of its quantity, become of little, or no value; if to a few only, what tribunal can be erected, to judge and diſtinguiſh, who of the King's ſubjects, are to be admitted to the favour, and who to be rejected? If the poor only are to be the objects, they have not ſecurity to give, or, if they had, perhaps they have as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle merit as any: commonly people become weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy by ſobriety and induſtry, the moſt uſeful qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications in a commonwealth, and poor by luxury, idleneſs and folly. What rules then can be found, for diſpenſing the public favours?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="159" facs="unknown:034421_0159_0FFD9EE15053DAF8"/>
                        <hi>Seventhly,</hi> That by theſe ſchemes, the more the currency, or paper money falls in value (by which word <hi>falling,</hi> is meant the <hi>riſing</hi> of gold, ſilver, Engliſh goods, and all other commodities, in nominal value, which is the certain proof of the other's falling) the greater is the borrower's advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; for the more eaſily will he pay his annuity; ſo that he may happen, by virtue of the act, to diſcharge, with the value of twenty pounds, a debt of <hi>one hundred,</hi> due to the man, who, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, kindly lent him the money, to relieve him in diſtreſs, or honeſtly ſold him his land, or goods, at their real value, at the time of lending, or ſale.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="160" facs="unknown:034421_0160_0FFD9F3ECD9F6D40"/>
                        <hi>Eighthly,</hi> That all thoſe deceive themſelves, who, becauſe gold and ſilver may be had at New York, or other places, in exchange for their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per money, ſuppoſe that the one, therefore, is as good as the other, unleſs the ſilver can be had at <hi>eight ſhillings</hi> per ounce, or the gold at <hi>ſix ſhillings</hi> per penny weight, at <hi>New York,</hi> as they were rated at the firſt ſtriking of their bills; but when their ſilver brings from <hi>nine</hi> to <hi>ten</hi> ſhillings per ounce, and their light piſtoles paſs at twenty-eight ſhillings, or higher, then bills are truly ſo much fallen in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, as the others are advanced. So, in <hi>Carolina,</hi> ſilver is to be purchaſed for their bills, but it is at <hi>thirty ſhillings</hi> per ounce, though they were ſtruck, as is ſaid, at <hi>ſeven ſhillings</hi> only!</p>
                     <p>Theſe being premiſed as general heads, what next follows, is to point out what are conceived to be the only means of ſupporting the credit of ſuch a currency, if iſſued.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="161" facs="unknown:034421_0161_0FFD9F0A4F323E58"/>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the whole ſum ſtruck be but ſmall, and juſt ſufficient to paſs from hand to hand, for a currency.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it be not continued for any longer time; for the paper will wear out, and it will not be ſo eaſy to exchange it for new, as ſome have imagined; which, it is much to be doubted, will be found impracticable: beſides, the ſooner it is to expire, the more eaſily will people be ſatisfied to take it. But further, our laws can continue in force no longer than five years, without the royal approbation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That care be taken to force the ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it in courſe, and in a juſt manner, by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, that ſhall render it abſolutely neceſſary for the public to have it ſunk; which, it is conceived,
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:034421_0162_0FFD9F4CDDFD69F8"/>
none of the methods hitherto diſcourſed of will effect. Theſe heads, may it pleaſe the Houſe, are what we have, at preſent, humbly to offer to your conſideration, on this ſubject.</p>

                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> paper currency.</note>I have, at your requeſt, very carefully conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the reſolutions of the Houſe, upon your journals, relating to public credit; and alſo ſome things, which, I find, have been offered to you, upon the ſame ſubject.</p>
                     <p>Credit may, no doubt, be compared to the mathematics, in ſo far as both ſciences will admit
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:034421_0163_0FFD9F2A65912448"/>
of deducing ſolid concluſions from ſelf-evident and clear principles; and yet, by the ſubtilty of an artiſt, truth, or falſehood, in either of them, is often ſo wrapped up and involved, that it is loſt unto, or miſapprehended by the plaineſt, and, generally ſpeaking, much the honeſteſt part of mankind.</p>
                     <p>But the common neceſſity, and general inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the whole body of the people, being a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of importance, on which we ought to ſpeak plainly, and act freely, I ſhall, without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble, or diſguiſe whatever, communicate my thoughts to you, in the ſimpleſt, and moſt intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible manner, that I can.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> If it be true, that the riches and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of this province chiefly depend on the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture of proviſions, and the exchanging of that manufacture, with other things, to advantage, it will alſo be true, that whatever increaſes the one, and, at the ſame time, encourages the other, will
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:034421_0164_0FFD9EE3C0A901A0"/>
juſtly deſerve the name of a public good; and the majority of thoſe, employed in ſuch manufacture and exchange, have thereby a right to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as the body of the people, whom you repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is evident, that, where there is no public debt, and a real value, in lands, to be pledged, paper money may, if there is occaſion for it, be ſtruck to advantage, without any riſk at all; for though, perhaps, it may contribute to hurt ſome weak people, in the ill management of their private affairs, yet, while any unfrugal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is loſt to the community, and is ſucceeded by one more induſtrious than he, the public cannot ſuffer by ſuch a change.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If, in the caſe of a paper currency, among us, it ſhould happen to follow (as it may be ſuppoſed it will) that ſilver and gold will be kept up for remittances to <hi>Great Britain,</hi> we ſhall then have no other means of dealing with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but the paper: ſhould the quantity, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:034421_0165_0FFD9F0D9D4CC350"/>
be leſs than is neceſſary to circulate our home trade, in its natural courſe, uſurers and ſharpers would have the ſame opportunity as they have now, to lie at catch for bargains, and make a monopoly of trade, by engroſſing the current money into their hands.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The very eſſence and nature of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, as well as the practice and experience of the greateſt banks in <hi>Europe,</hi> directs all ſuch bills to be iſſued at ſomething leſs than the common intereſt, for that is, in effect, a premium by the public, to encourage their circulation: and whoſoever is pleaſed to ſay, that the bank of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> loſes credit, by lending money at <hi>two per cent.</hi> or the bank of <hi>England,</hi> by lending money at <hi>four per cent.</hi> ſhall ſcarce prevail with me to think the aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion worthy of any anſwer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> I am not of opinion with thoſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, who are pleaſed to alledge, that the value of ſilver, at <hi>New York,</hi> which, in the month of September laſt, was from <hi>eight ſhillings</hi> and <hi>ſix
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:034421_0166_0FFD9EE665ADC850"/>
pence</hi> to <hi>eight ſhillings</hi> and <hi>nine pence,</hi> is occaſioned by their paper; for, in this province, where there never has been any paper yet, from <hi>five to ten per cent.</hi> has, for ſeveral years, been given in exchange for ſilver. And as to their computation of gold, the gentlemen, perhaps, have not had occaſion, of late, to be informed, that the heavieſt <hi>piſtoles,</hi> in <hi>York,</hi> go at no more than <hi>twenty-eight ſhillings,</hi> and ſmaller, or cut gold, at the common ſtandard value, in that province; where, it is believed, the people could not poſſibly carry on half the quantity of their preſent trade and buſineſs, without the help of paper.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> I muſt alſo take leave to differ, in opinion, with thoſe, who, without enquiry, and by wholeſale, are pleaſed to condemn all ſchemes of lending money, to be diſcharged by annual pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for I truly think that method will not only ſuit the different circumſtances and conveniency of
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:034421_0167_0FFD9F2CD39B3210"/>
the people beſt, but, in all reſpects, will prove the ſafeſt and moſt profitable, as well as equal; and my reaſons for it, are theſe:</p>
                     <p n="1">1ſt. Whatever quantity be iſſued, if one fifth, ſixth, or tenth part, of the ſum, according to the time, for which it is to laſt, muſt neceſſarily come into office every year, it may be lent out again, at <hi>five per cent.</hi> for any time, within the term, to ſuch perſons as had no place, or opportunity, to come into the firſt loan: by which means all the frightful, odd things, mentioned in the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's ſixth obſervation, will preſently vaniſh; for every man, in this caſe, according to his ability, may, if he thinks fit, ſhare in that advantage; which the public moſt generouſly and prudently offers to the neceſſities of the people.</p>
                     <p n="2">2ndly, If ſo great a ſhare of the whole comes in yearly to the office, in order to be lent out again, it will, in a great meaſure, prevent engroſſing,
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:034421_0168_0FFD9F0F207130E8"/>
and help the circulation conſiderably; it will alſo give more frequent opportunity of diſcovering frauds, and gradually increaſe the public ſtock and revenue of the bank; and by that means it will demonſtrably ſink the original ſum, within the time prefixed; that is to ſay, the paper, at the end of that term, will either be found in the office, or its value in caſh, ready to pay what ſhall then happen, by accident, to be yet abroad.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Seventhly,</hi> If too great a ſecurity is demanded for the loan of public money, I think, it will, in a great meaſure, fruſtrate the deſign of relieving many of the middling, or moſt induſtrious, ſort of the people; wherefore, it is my opinion, that
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:034421_0169_0FFD9EE9334C4F18"/>
one half of the value of ground rents may very ſafely be lent to thoſe, who are willing and able to give ſuch ſecurity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eighthly,</hi> If, upon further conſideration, you find that the ſum intended may be iſſued to better advantage, for a longer time, I think the objection, that our acts can only ſubſiſt <hi>five years,</hi> without being approved, is of no weight; for, beſides, that it would not be very civil, to ſuppoſe that the legiſlative authority here would deliberately go up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any act of that importance, or indeed, of any kind, which we had the leaſt cauſe to ſuſpect would be diſagreeable to his Majeſty, or the ſentiments of his miniſtry: we know very well, it is in his Majeſty's royal power and prerogative, to repeal and make void, at any time, all acts of Aſſembly, to be made, or paſſed, in <hi>America:</hi> and, for my

part, if I did not, in my conſcience, believe that the act, now propoſed, would be made on ſuch a rational, juſt and equal foot, as would rather claim his Majeſty's gracious favour, in aſſenting to it, than render it obnoxious to his impartial juſtice, I ſhould neither have given myſelf nor you this trouble.</p>
                     <p>Gentlemen, theſe are moſt frankly and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely my preſent ſentiments of the matter before you; and, as I do not find myſelf inclined to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and much leſs to ſhew any ſtiffneſs, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy, in an affair of ſuch a general concern, I ſhall very much rely on your diligent circumſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and care, for the good of your country, being ſtill ready and willing to give you all the aſſiſtance in my power.</p>

                     <p>"The royal charter, with reſpect to the Proprietary and the people jointly, may be conſidered as the terms, or condition of that bond of friendſhip, and mutual intereſt, entered into between the Proprietary and the firſt purchaſers and ſettlers of this colony, and their heirs and aſſigns for ever; and as, in all matters of government, the Proprietary is always to be repreſented, either by himſelf, or his Deputy Governor, ſo is the people to be repreſented by themſelves, or their delegates, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully choſen and convened, according to the direction of the ſaid charter; and theſe two repreſentations, from time to time, do, without the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of any other perſon, or thing, evidently compoſe the whole legiſlative power, or General Aſſembly of this province.</p>

All which clearly ſhews that the Proprietary's intention, in that charter, was not to bind up himſelf, nor Lieutenants from <hi>adviſing</hi> and <hi>conſulting</hi> with others, in legiſlation.

I purpoſed long ere this time to have anſwered that remonſtrance, but finding my ſincere intentions to preſerve peace and unanimity, in the province, had been manifeſtly perverted, to the great diſquiet of the people; and that too by thoſe, whoſe duty it was to have acted another part, I was willing to lay hold of a more favourable opportunity, (when you might be left to your own prudent deliberations, without being influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced to miſinterpret the good intentions of the

family towards you) to aſſure you, that, if, at any time, I fall ſhort of doing any thing, that may advance your intereſt and reputation, it muſt proceed only from my not having it in my power. And as to that part of my letter, which was made uſe of to procure that remonſtrance, I do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it was deſigned as a cautionary direction, or limitation, upon the acting Governor; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt apprehenſion that it could ever have been conſtrued, by the Aſſembly, as any deſign upon the liberties of the freemen of <hi>Penſilvania:</hi> becauſe the <hi>Council,</hi> according to its conſtitution, either is, or ought to be, compoſed of perſons of the beſt circumſtances and abilities, reſiding and inhabiting within the ſaid province; and whoſe intereſt muſt, without all doubt, be the ſame with your own, and that of the people, whom you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent. Nor was this inſtruction any other, but, in effect, the ſame with what had ever been given, by my late huſband, your Proprietor, to all his Deputy Governors: and (without mentioning the unhappy occaſion given, for writing that letter) I was the rather induced to renew this inſtruction, becauſe by the proceedings of your own Houſe, but a few years ago, it appears, the then Aſſembly expreſſed a very particular concern at the Deputy Governor's declining to take the <hi>advice</hi> of the <hi>Council,</hi> upon the bills, ſent to him, from their Houſe, to be paſſed into laws:<note n="*" place="bottom">Governor Gookin, vid. pag 91, &amp;c.</note> and, therefore, I muſt conclude, that, if in this, you had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely left to have followed the reſolutions of your own judgments, you would have continued of the ſame ſentiments, and have judged it a very <hi>neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inſtruction,</hi> at that time, all circumſtances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered; (but more eſpecially if you had been aware of what has happened but too plainly ſince) that this very remonſtrance was obtained with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to wreſt the government out of the hands of
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:034421_0187_0FFD9EF0B3148DA8"/>
the Proprietor's family; and by that means, at once, to deprive you of thoſe valuable privileges, ſecured to you, as well by the royal charter, grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the late Proprietor, as by the ſeveral grants and laws, made by him, under the ſame; for the preſervation of which you expreſs ſo juſt a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern: and I do aſſure you, it is not eaſy for me to ſay, whether for your ſafety, or my own, I am better pleaſed that this attempt upon the rights of our family, and your privileges, has proved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful: and, without ſaying any more of that piece of management, I hope, we ſhall, all of us, learn to cultivate and maintain ſo entire an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and mutual good underſtanding, as may preſerve us from ever becoming a prey to deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men; who, it is evident (notwithſtanding their fair pretences) conſider none of us in any other light, than to ſerve their own ends and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, even, though at the expence of all that is valuable to us.

                           <p>That they, in an eſpecial manner, have a watchful eye and overſight of their ſeveral members, that this great favour be not <hi>abuſed,</hi> or <hi>miſuſed,</hi> by any profeſſing truth with us.</p>
                           <p>Our bleſſed Lord, and Lawgiver, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> told his diſciples, <hi>"Ye are the light of the world; a city, that is ſet on a hill, cannot be hid."</hi> And in every age, as many as do walk in obedience to his goſpel, muſt unavoidably be ſo; <hi>the daily croſs and ſelf-denial,</hi> which he doth enjoin, (thoſe ſure tokens of a Chriſtian diſciple) are public marks, which are eaſily ſeen, and readily obſerved, by thoſe, with whom we have occaſion of buſineſs, or concern; and our tranſacting thereof with uprightneſs, juſtice and moderation will ſhew that we have an awful regard to our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whom we acknowledge and declare to be our great Lawgiver and Example.</p>
                           <p>The great end and deſign of the new covenant, <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>truth,</hi> which is come by him, is to draw men into obedience to his law, written in the heart; by which only the inſide can be made clean; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the degrees of obedience to this divine law, which the apoſtle calls, <hi>The law of the ſpirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> the proper effect thereof will appear; that is, <hi>the inſide will be made clean alſo.</hi> Hereby <hi>truth, juſtice, righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>charity</hi> will ſhine forth in the words and actions of ſuch; and then may be truly applied to them that ſaying of <hi>Chriſt; a city, that is ſet upon a hill, cannot be hid.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Beſide the inward engagements of this divine law, to ſpeak and act according to truth, there is, at this time, alſo an outward engagement, which the government hath laid upon us, not only by the favour of this act, but alſo by the manner, wherein they have conferred it: for, in the preamble, it is ſaid; <hi>it is manifeſt that the ſaid people called Quakers, have not abuſed the liberty and indulgence, allowed them by law.</hi> Which teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of the Legiſlature concerning the uſe of the late <hi>ſolemn affirmation,</hi> upon twenty-five years experience, ought, at leaſt, to ſtir up all Friends to great watchfulneſs and care, in the uſe of this further eaſe and relief; that this teſtimony may be continued, and thereby confirm the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their favourable ſentiments concerning us.</p>
                           <p>And as this ſignal indulgence may draw the eyes and obſervation of many people upon us, it may be expected, among theſe, ſome will look on us with an evil eye, watch for our halting, and ſeek occaſion againſt us, upon any miſuſe, or abuſe, of this legal privilege, which any, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing truth with us, or but bearing the name, ſhould fall into, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, therefore, that there may be no miſuſe of this favour, we do earneſtly deſire and entreat, that the ſeveral meetings do adviſe and exhort <hi>Friends,</hi> that they watch againſt all vexatious and trifling cauſes of difference; and not, for any ſuch cauſe, implead, or commence ſuits of law, upon the encouragement of this <hi>ſolemn affirmation,</hi> for that would certainly be a perverting the good deſign of the government, in the granting thereof, and muſt be deemed a great <hi>miſuſe</hi> of this privilege.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, That there be no abuſes thereof committed, we do, in like manner, entreat and deſire, that Friends may be exhorted and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, when any juſt and valuable occaſion doth require any to make uſe of this <hi>affirmation,</hi> that ſuch <hi>Friend,</hi> or <hi>Friends,</hi> be very conſiderate, and ſure of the truth of what they are about to <hi>affirm;</hi> for where property, or liberty are concerned, a falſe or corrupt evidence in very injurious, and may prove deſtructive; beſide, it ought, on all occaſions, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, that, <hi>a falſe witneſs ſhall not be unpuniſhed, and he that ſpeaketh lies ſhall not eſcape;</hi> and that the command, <hi>thou ſhalt not bear falſe witneſs,</hi> is as well in the goſpel as in the law; and that <hi>all liars ſhall have their part in the lake, which burneth with fire and brimſtone.</hi> To theſe inward obligations, on the conſcience, to truth-ſpeaking, there is alſo added the outward guard of pains, penalties and forfeitures, to be inflicted on ſuch as ſhall lawfully be convicted of wilful and corrupt perjury.</p>
                           <p>We cannot omit alſo to remind you, that ſhould any, under our name, ſo far depart from the righteous law of God, as herein to become guilty, they will thereby contract to themſelves perpetual infamy, and to the body, whereof they may pretend to be members, very great ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal and reproach; and ſuch inſtances repeated might provoke the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to deprive us of this great benefit; how great would be the load of guilt on any, who ſhould be the occaſion thereof!</p>
                           <p>Let it be alſo conſidered, that the ground of our petitioning and ſoliciting this further caſe and relief, was a conſcientious ſcruple, <hi>to ſwear at all,</hi> at the ſame time to be guilty of <hi>falſe affirming,</hi> and while they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to great degrees of purity, to fall ſhort in common honeſty! It is indeed among the higheſt degrees of hypocriſy, a crime abhorred by God and man! &amp;c.</p>
                           <p>To all theſe particulars (ſeveral of them being here omitted) we think it neceſſary to add, and very earneſtly and tenderly to recommend to all <hi>Friends,</hi> that, as much as may be, they do avoid all diſputes and differences, with their neighbours; and, as much as poſſible, <hi>follow peace with all men;</hi> and, in a particular manner, we do preſs, that all diſputes and differences, between <hi>Friends,</hi> be avoided; or, if any do hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, that earneſt endeavours be uſed, by accommodation, or equitable and impartial reference, to end them, without going to law; that ſo the rebuke of the apoſtle may not neceſſarily be applied to any, <hi>"Now, therefore, there is utterly a fault among you, becauſe ye go to law with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther."</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Dear Friends, theſe things, in Chriſtian concern of mind, we have repreſented, in order that all may be ſtirred up to a humble and faithful walking, not, as knowing that any will fall ſhort, in the above particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, but, beloved, <hi>we are perſuaded better things of you; and things that accompany ſalvation, though thus we ſpeak.</hi>

                     <p>This province, with the powers of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was granted by king Charles the Second to our Proprietor, who, at the time of the ſaid grant, was known to diſſent from the national way of worſhip, in divers points, and particularly in that part of outward behaviour, of refuſing to pay unto man the honour, that he, with all others, of the ſame profeſſion, believed to be due only to the <hi>Supreme Being;</hi> and they, on all occaſions,

               <p>"It is our great happineſs, that, inſtead of triennial Aſſemblies, a privilege, which ſeveral other colonies have long endeavoured to obtain, ours are annual; and, for that reaſon, as well as others, leſs liable to be practiſed upon, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, either with money or preſents. We ſit upon our own adjournments, when we pleaſe, and as long as we think neceſſary; and we are not to be ſent a packing, in the middle of a debate, and diſabled from repreſenting our juſt grievances to our gracious ſovereign, if there ſhould be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; which has often been the fate of Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies in other places.</p>
               <p>"We have no officers, but what are neceſſary; none but what earn their ſalaries, and thoſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally are either elected by the people, or appointed by their repreſentatives.</p>
               <p>"Other provinces ſwarm with unneceſſary of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, nominated by the Governors; who often make it a main part of their care to ſupport thoſe officers, (notwithſtanding their oppreſſions) at all

I hope it will ever be the wiſdom of our Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies to create no great offices nor officers, nor indeed any officer at all, but what is really neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the ſervice of the country, and to be ſure to let the people, or their repreſentatives, have, at leaſt, a ſhare in their nomination, or appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This will always be a good ſecurity againſt the miſchievous influence of men holding places at the pleaſure of the Governor.</p>

Other inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental taxes are aſſeſſed, collected and applied by perſons annually choſen by the people themſelves. Such is our happy ſtate, as to our civil rights.</p>
               <p>"Nor are we leſs happy, in the enjoyment of a perfect freedom, as to religion.

               <p>"Yet I have obſerved, that, in former Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies there have been men, who have acted in ſuch a manner, as if they utterly diſregarded all thoſe ineſtimable privileges, and (whether from private pique and perſonal diſlike, or through miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, I will not determine) have gone great lengths in riſking our happineſs, in the proſecution of ſuch meaſures, as did not at all ſquare with the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, they frequently made, of their love to our government.</p>
               <p>"When I reflect on the ſeveral ſtruggles, which many of us, now preſent, have had with thoſe men, in order to reſcue the conſtitution out of their hands, which, through their miſtakes (if they really were miſtakes) was often brought on the brink of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, I cannot help cautioning you, in the moſt earneſt manner, againſt all perſonal animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, in public conſultations, as a rock, which, if not avoided, the conſtitution will, at ſome time or other, infallibly ſplit upon."<note n="*" place="bottom">Andrew Hamilton, Eſquire, of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> died in the latter end of the ſummer 1741.

                     <p>"About twelve years ago, under the mild and peaceable adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Governor <hi>Gordon,</hi> I was one of thoſe, who were inſtrumental in procuring this part of the province to be erected into a ſeparate county, and have contributed, according to my ſmall ability, to have rule and order eſtabliſhed and preſerved amongſt us.

                     <p>"And, firſt, I obſerve to you, <hi>gentlemen of the Grand Jury,</hi> that the privilege of trials, by <hi>juries,</hi> is counted older than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and was not unknown to the ancient <hi>Britons: juries</hi> are looked upon as an eſſential felicity to <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſubjects; and are put in the firſt rank among <hi>Engliſh</hi> liberties: the reaſon given is this; becauſe no man's life ſhall be touched, for any crime (out of parliament) unleſs he be thought guilty by two ſeveral <hi>juries;</hi> and theſe juries, being ſubſtantial men, taken, from time to time, out of the neighbourhood of the perſon accuſed, cannot be ſuppoſed to be biaſed; whereas, it is obſervable, that Judges are made by prerogative; and many have been preferred by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt miniſters of ſtate; and may be ſo again; and ſuch advanced as will ſerve a preſent turn, rather than thoſe of more integrity, and ſkill, in the laws.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>"Juries</hi> are of two kinds, and are commonly diſtinguiſhed by <hi>Grand</hi> and <hi>Petit Juries;</hi> the former, which you are, have larger power than the other, as very plainly appears by the qualification, which you have taken. Your power extends to all offences within the county; and your office is principally concerned in two things, <hi>preſentments</hi> and <hi>indictments;</hi> the difference of which is this, the firſt is, when you, of your own knowledge, or enquiry, take notice of ſome offence, crime, or nuiſance, to the injury of the public, which you think ought to be puniſhed, or removed, and give notice to the court, in writing briefly, of the nature of the thing, and the perſon's name and place: this is called a <hi>preſentment,</hi> and differs from an <hi>indictment,</hi> in theſe two reſpects; firſt, in that it is not drawn up in form: whereas <hi>indictments</hi> are generally drawn up and preſented to you, by the Attorney General and the witneſſes qualified to attend you; and when you have examined them, you either <hi>indorſe,</hi> that it is a <hi>true bill;</hi> or, that it does not appear, to you, ſufficient grounds for the accuſation, that the perſon's life, eſtate, or reputation, ſhould be brought in queſtion; all which is underſtood, by <hi>indorſing</hi> the word <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramus.</hi> From hence it appears that you are appointed, as well to be guardians of the lives, liberties, eſtates, and even, reputations of the innocent, as to be a means of bringing offenders to juſtice. And, as you are endued with a ſufficient portion of underſtanding, to know what offences are <hi>repreſentable</hi> by you, I ſhall not enumerate them; having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid, they are generally under your notice; but ſhall rather recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to you, and your ſucceſſors, a ſteady care, both for the ſecurity of the innocent (for by you malicious proſecutions may be cropped in bad) and for bringing offenders to the juſtice of the law; that by their public ſhame and ſuffering, they and others may be deterred from the like of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, for the future.</p>
                     <p>"The office of a civil Magiſtrate, or Juſtice of the Peace, is an office of high truſt, and ought to be executed with great care, circumſpection, and good conſcience. Magiſtrates may be looked upon as Miniſters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>God,</hi> inveſted with ſome branches of power, for the public benefit, <hi>viz.</hi> To be a terror and ſcourge to <hi>evil doers,</hi> and a praiſe to them who <hi>do well;</hi> and while they lead lives exemplary of this, and in their public actions, have this principally in view, diſtributing juſtice impartially, with clean hands and pure hearts, their poſt is truly honourable, and they are highly worthy of regard. But if they unhappily deviate from this rule, if they are found in the practice of thoſe crimes, which they ought to puniſh and ſuppreſs, if they pervert juſtice for bribes, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the poor and innocent, they, therefore render themſelves highly unworthy of an office of ſo great a truſt.</p>
                     <p>"I was always a friend to power, well knowing that good and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome laws, duly executed, are ſo far from being a reſtraint upon true liberty, that they are only as regulating ſprings to the paſſions, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of it; and our worthy Founder, and firſt Proprietor tells us, <hi>"That he compoſed his frame of government with a view to ſupport power in reverence with the people, and to ſecure the people from the abuſe of power:"</hi> and theſe two are generally obſerved to attend each other, as cauſes and their effects. And a noted profeſſor of the law, in this province, ſome years ago, when he eſpouſed the cauſe of liberty, and loaded with age and infirmities, took a long journey in defence of it, has theſe words on power; <hi>"It may juſtly be compared to a great river, which, while kept within due bounds, is both beautiful and uſeful; but when it overflows its banks, it is then too impetuous to be ſtemmed; it bears down all before it, and brings deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and deſolation where it comes."</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>"If, then, theſe are the ill effects of lawleſs power, every wiſe man ought to be on his guard, to prevent them, by keeping up the banks of liberty, and common right, the only bulwark againſt it.</p>
                     <p>"It was in defence and ſupport of this great bulwark, againſt the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of power, under a pretence of ſerving his majeſty, but done in ſuch a manner as, I apprehend, cannot be ſuppoſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"For this cauſe, my friends and country-men, for the cauſe of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh liberty,</hi> for ſtanding in the civil defence of right and property, are we diſmiſſed; and I rejoice, and am heartily glad, that I have been one of thoſe, who are thought worthy of diſpleaſure.</p>
                     <p>"And now, to conclude, I take my leave, in the words of a Judge in <hi>Iſrael, "Here I am, witneſs againſt me; whom have I defrauded; whom have I oppreſſed; or, of whoſe hands have I received any bribe, to blind my eyes therewith? And I will reſtore it."</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>"May the Prince of Peace, who is the King of kings, protect the people of this province, from domeſtic foes and foreign enemies! is my hearty deſire; and ſo I hid you all farewell."</p>
                     <p>Reſpecting this ſame <hi>John Wright,</hi> it may be further obſerved, in this place, that he died about the year 1751, in <hi>Lancaſter</hi> county, where he had lived, in the eighty-fourth year of his age.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Memorial of John Wright.</note>It is recorded of him, "That he was born in the year 1667, in <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſhire,</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> of religious and reputable parents; who were among the early profeſſors of the doctrines held by the people called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and lived and died highly eſteemed members of that community. He was educated with a view to the practice of phyſic; but he declined pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing it; and entered into trade, till the year 1714; when he removed with his family, into <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> well recommended by certificate, from his friends, the <hi>Quakers,</hi> in that part of <hi>England,</hi> both as to his moral character, and as a preacher, in the ſociety; with whom they had, for many years, lived in ſtrict amity.</p>
                     <p>"Soon after his ſettlement in the province, his principles and conduct recommended him to the notice of the public: he was a Repreſentative to the General Aſſembly, for <hi>Cheſter</hi> county, and many years one for <hi>Lancaſter</hi> county. In his ſtation as a Judge, for the laſt county, he was noted for a prompt, honeſt plainneſs, and candour, and an inflexible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity; one inſtance of which appears in the cauſe and manner of his diſmiſſion from that office, in 1741, as above mentioned.</p>
                     <p>"He continued to attend the Aſſemblies, till broken health, and an advanced age, rendered ſuch attendance difficult, and ſometimes impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable; although the people among whom he lived, from a long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his ſervices, and regard to him, would not be prevailed on by himſelf, or his family, to name another in his ſtead, for that ſtation; but continued to return his name till he died.</p>
                     <p>"Through every ſtation in life, his good will to mankind, his love of peace and good order, and his endeavours to give them a permanent footing, in his neighbourhood, and in the country, in general, were known to be his delight and ſtudy: his ſenſe of religion, and the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony he bore to it, were free from intemperate zeal, yet earneſt, and attended with life and ſpirit, influenced by the love of God, and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence to his whole creation; ſuch he continued, with his underſtanding clear, his mind calm, chearful and reſigned, to the advanced period of old age, when he expired without a groan,"</p>

                  <hi>Thomas Penn,</hi> after this, on the death of his brother <hi>John,</hi> in 1746, became the principal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor, and poſſeſſed of three fourths of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. He lived the longeſt of the three brothers;
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:034421_0227_0FFDA046245BC128"/>
but he appears never to have been very popular,<note place="margin">1742.</note> in the province: he is ſaid, in general, to have conducted himſelf rather too much reſerved to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the people, and too nearly attached to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain views, for his private intereſt, in reference to the province; which are things oppoſite to popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity. Beſides, the imprudence of ſome perſons in the province, in order to ſhew their diſlike at ſome part of his conduct, which did not pleaſe them, tended to create and increaſe a ſimilar diſpoſition, where the contrary ought the more to have been cultivated and cheriſhed; but, in general, he was a perſon of a worthy character, and of moderate principles.</p>

of infelicity, and the moſt pernicious evils; even, liberty itſelf, than which nothing is more deſirable, when carried beyond a certain point, degenerates into licentiouſneſs; and, from its effects, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the worſt kind of tyranny, is, of all evils, frequently rendered the moſt deſtructive to the human race; for, as one beaſt of prey devours another, ſo men, whatever refined notions they may otherwiſe poſſeſs, or pretend to, when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained neither by law nor conſcience, are more pernicious, and that often to their own ſpecies, than the worſt of ſavages, or, even, the moſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venous of the brutal kind!

                  <hi>Liberty,</hi> which had long been conſpicuous in the province, and of which the early inhabitants had, in general, ſo long ſhewed themſelves worthy, by not making an improper uſe of it, had drawn great numbers of various ſorts of people into the country; many of whom were perſons of very different principles and manners from thoſe of the generality of the more early ſettlers, and many of their ſucceſſors and deſcendants.

               <p>This was repeatedly done, upon the return of the electors; till, at laſt, many of the inhabitants, being enraged, took meaſures to force them into their ſhips, and near fifty of them into priſon; but they were ſoon diſcharged:<note place="margin">occaſioned by party leaders, &amp;c.</note> for it afterwards appeared, that they had been privately employed, in this work, by ſome party leaders; it being then in time of war, when conſequently party ſpirit, which is ſo nearly allied to it, and, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme, ends in the ſame, was encouraged to make greater efforts, to diſtract the public proceedings, and under this Governor's adminiſtration, by more ways than one, to divert the eſtabliſhed form of the conſtitution, from its <hi>peaceable order and courſe,</hi> into that of its oppoſite nature; in which an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing party here, ſince that time, though gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally under the moſt ſpecious and plauſible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, have ever appeared to take delight: for change is grateful to the human race; and, proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, no government of mankind is, at all times,

                     <p>He had a turn to literature, and though he was not favoured with much of a learned education, yet, as he was a perſon of good natural parts, much reading, and converſed with all ranks of men, in his own country, he writ ſeveral pieces, to good advantage, on different, but generally the moſt intereſting ſubjects, of a religious, moral and civil nature; ſome of which have been publiſhed for general benefit.</p>

               <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>THUS far appears the manner of the riſe, colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization, increaſe and happy eſtabliſhment of the flouriſhing province of <hi>Pennſylvania;</hi> which, by means of the very remarkable induſtry, honeſty, moderation, and good policy of the firſt and early coloniſts and their ſucceſſors, from a wilderneſs, became as a fruitful field, and a very valuable and important addition to the Britiſh intereſt in <hi>America,</hi> without any expence to the parent country.<note n="*" place="bottom">This being written about the year 1778 or 1779, in a time of great confuſion, contention and uncertainty, in this part of <hi>America,</hi> alludes, in the concluſion, to a probable, or apparent future change, &amp;c.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The enjoyment of that rational freedom of thinking, and religious worſhip, with a juſt and equal participation of natural and civil rights, which, in the populouſneſs, and general polity of <hi>Europe,</hi> ſeemed to be either too much loſt, or, at leaſt, too partially diſtributed, was the compact of ſettlement; and the reſtoration and fruition of that peace and tranquillity, which the wickedneſs and folly of the human race had ſo much baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the world, by the more effectual encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement and promotion of primitive truth and ſimplicity, in the actions and manners of men, in a way, that ſeemed beſt to thoſe concerned, and ſo far as the ſtate of human nature would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, were the chief views and motives to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking.</p>
               <p>That theſe were the real principles, upon which the conſtitution and government of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> were primarily founded, it is ſufficiently known and manifeſt, from the beſt documents, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by a ſeries of moſt certain facts, as given, though defectively, in the preceding hiſtory, and
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:034421_0235_0FFD9F9C730324A0"/>
in the following view of the general ſtate of the province, between the years 1760 and 1770: that its great and rapid increaſe, its happy and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing condition ſince, down to the preſent time, have been principally owing to the influence of theſe ſame principles, in degree ſtill prevailing, future time will further, and more fully demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, whenever the unhappy reverſe thereof ſhall take place; which now ſeems to be faſt approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: by whoſe contrary effects will then ſtill more clearly appear, in contraſt, both the cauſe and means of the extraordinary, and ſo long continued proſperity, and unparalled felicity, for which this province has been long ſo juſtly famed, above all other countries, at leaſt, in <hi>America,</hi> if not in the whole world: a ſtate, in ſome reſpect, ſo nearly reſembling that of thoſe <hi>ſaturnian</hi> times, in <hi>Italy,</hi> which, we are told formerly produced the <hi>golden age,</hi> and ſo far actually realizing ancient fable, that to its inhabitants, perhaps, before any other people, on the ſurface of the globe, might parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, and with great propriety, have been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the exclamation of the poet Virgil,
<q>"Felices nimium ſua ſi bona norint, Agricolee!"</q>
as well as that of Milton, reſpecting the ſtate of the firſt parents of mankind,
<q>
                     <l>—"and, O! yet happieſt, if ye ſeek</l>
                     <l>No happier ſtate, and know to know no more."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But all things have their time; and both king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and empires, as well as ſmaller ſtates, and particular perſons, muſt die; <hi>"finis ac ab origine pendet;"</hi> yet folly often ſhortens their duration, as wiſdom and virtue prolong their more happy exiſtence: and we may plainly ſee men frequently and greedily embrace the former, for the latter, and with great zeal and confidence often purſue their own miſery, under a ſtrong perſuaſion of the contrary: for, as the human body, when in
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:034421_0236_0FFDA00B05DEC308"/>
its moſt plethoric ſtate, and in the greateſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of health and vigour, is often then moſt in danger, or neareſt a ſudden change, ſo the late and preſent extraordinary proſperity, the increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, flouriſhing and happy ſtate of this country, at preſent, above others, may probably be a prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtic, or ſign, of its being in a more critical ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and danger.</p>
               <p>For ſo long as the fatal deluſion, which, we are told, originally rendered mankind unhappy, ſtill continues, though in different degrees, and various appearances, to except entirely from its baneful influence no part of the human race, every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, in this world, will be ſubject to muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; but then the remedy has ever been equal to the diſeaſe; for the Creator and Supporter of the world, whoſe peculiar attribute it is, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce good out of evil, has placed within the power and choice of mankind, thoſe means of recovery from all evil, which are, at leaſt, adequate to the nature and extent of it; and ſometimes places ſpecial examples before the eyes of the human race, like this of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> to ſhew them the abſolute poſſibility of a ſtill ſuperior bliſs, and more exalted felicity, than is commonly experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced in the world, not only in an individual, but alſo in a collective, or national, and more univerſal capacity.</p>

the ſouth-weſterly are diſtinguiſhed for producing hazineſs and warmth or heat in ſummer.

And notwithſtanding the ſpring commences at <hi>Philadelphia</hi> near a month later than about <hi>London,</hi> yet the harveſt in <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> is a month earlier than in <hi>England;</hi> which renders that ſeaſon very ſhort in the former.</p>

               <p>The ſecond ſort of land, which is far the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of what is, at preſent, improved, is rather of a poor, ſhallow, or middling kind of ſoil; but, as much of it is of a ſtrong, clayey, or loamy nature, and in ſome places abounds with limeſtone, it is moſtly very capable of improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, even after it has been much worn out by bad management, and is, for the moſt part, very ſuitable for grain; to which uſe it is chiefly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, ſo far back in the country as improvement has hitherto advanced.</p>
               <p>Of the third kind of land, in the province, which is of very little, or no value, it is difficult to aſcertain the quantity; but, in divers places of the more remote and mountainous parts, no ſmall proportion of the land is ſo broken, ſtony, rocky, or barren, as to be either from its preſent ſituation, not worth improving, or otherwiſe entirely incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of culture; ſome places ſcarcely producing any tree, or vegetable, whatever; and others, at beſt, only thoſe of the moſt dwarfiſh, or ſhrubby kind.</p>

                        <hi>Note.</hi> The town of Lancaſter in 1752, being about twenty years old, contained three hundred and eleven taxables.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Note,</hi> The land tax of eighteen pence in the pound, in 1771, amounted to about £. 27,600, and the exciſe, in the ſame year, £. 5,000; of which the city and county of Philadelphia paid about £. 14,000.</p>
                  </note> and conſidering the very great increaſe, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ways, ſince that time, the whole number of people in <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> about the year 1770, may probably be near two hundred thouſand, at leaſt, or ſomewhere between two and three hundred thouſand.</p>

increaſe of the whole twenty thouſand families, with the freſh immigrants, which were very numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, in the ſame proportion, and allowing ſeven perſons to a family, they would, in 1770, amount to about two hundred and fifty thouſand; the tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables being, by this computation, nearly one in ſix, rendered ſo numerous by reaſon of the poll-tax, &amp;c. And the three lower counties of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle, Kent</hi> and <hi>Suſſex</hi> on <hi>Delaware</hi> might probably contain between twenty and thirty thouſand more.</p>

               <p>The houſes are moſtly built of brick, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with ſhingles of cedar, very uniform, plain and neat; though both good marble, and other ſtone, are procured, within fifteen miles from the city, by water carriage, and by land near the ſame diſtance.

It is, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, as improbable for a people, who have not the knowledge of letters, to derive their original from thoſe, who were poſſeſſed of that uſeful and neceſſary ſcience, and not to retain it among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves afterwards, as it would be nugatory to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to give an account thereof, without the means, abſolutely neceſſary for that purpoſe?

They abhor what appears to have a ſlaviſh motive to action, as inconſiſtent with their notion of freedom and independency; even ſtrong and importunate perſuaſion is induſtriouſly avoided by them, as bordering too much on depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, and a kind of violence offered to the will; they dread flavery more than death.

They got fire by rubbing certain pieces of wood together of different ſorts, turning the end of a hard piece upon the ſide of one which was ſoft and dry. By the means of fire and their ſtone axes, they felled large trees, and afterwards ſcooped them into bowls and other utenſils.

                        <p>"A <hi>ſpeech</hi> delivered by an <hi>Indian chief,</hi> in reply to a ſermon, preached by a <hi>Swediſh Miſſionary,</hi> in order to convert the <hi>Indians</hi> to the <hi>Chriſtian religion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>"Since the ſubject of his (the Miſſionary's) errand is to perſuade us to embrace a new doctrine, perhaps it may not be amiſs, before we offer him the reaſons, why we cannot comply with his requeſt, to acquaint him with the grounds and principles of that religion, which he would have us abandon.</p>
                        <p>"Our forefathers were under a ſtrong perſuaſion, as we are, that thoſe, who act well, in this life, ſhall be rewarded in the next, according to the degree of their virtue: and on the other hand, that thoſe, who behave wickedly here, will undergo ſuch puniſhments hereafter, as are proportionate to the crimes they were guilty of This hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly and invariably received and acknowledged for a truth, through every ſucceſſive generation of our anceſtors. It could not have taken its riſe from fable; for human fiction, however artfully and plauſibly contrived, can never gain credit long, among any people, where free enquiry is allowed; which was never denied by our anceſtors; who, on the contrary, thought it the ſacred, inviolable, natural right of every man, to examine and judge for himſelf. Therefore we think it evident that our notion, concerning future rewards and puniſhments, was either revealed immediately from heaven, to ſome of our forefathers, and from them deſcended to us, or, that it was implanted in each of us, at our creation, by the Creator of all things. Whatever the methods might have been, whereby God hath been pleaſed to make known to us his will, and give us a knowledge of our duty, it is ſtill, in our ſenſe, a <hi>divine revelation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>"Now we deſire to propoſe to him ſome few queſtions. Does he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that our forefathers, men, eminent for their piety, conſtant and warm in the purſuit of virtue, hoping thereby to merit everlaſting hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, were all <hi>damned?</hi> Does he think that we, who are their zealous imitators, in good works, and influenced by the ſame motives as they were, earneſtly endeavouring, with the greateſt circumſpection, to tread the paths of integrity, are in a ſtate of <hi>damnation?</hi> If theſe be his ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they are ſurely as impious as they are bold and daring.</p>
                        <p>"In the next place, we beg that he would explain himſelf more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly concerning the <hi>revelation</hi> he talks of. If he admits no other, than what is contained in his <hi>written book,</hi> the contrary is evident, from what has been ſhewn before: but, if he ſays, God has revealed himſelf to us, but not ſufficient for our ſalvation; then, we aſk, to what purpoſe ſhould he have revealed himſelf to us in any wiſe? It is clear, that a <hi>revelation,</hi> inſufficient to ſave, cannot put us in a better condition, than we ſhould be in, without any revelation at all. We cannot conceive that God ſhould point out to us the end, we ought to aim at, without opening to us the way to arrive at that end. But, ſuppoſing our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings to be ſo far illuminated, as to know it to be our duty to pleaſe God, who yet hath left us under an incapacity of doing it, will this <hi>Miſſionary,</hi> therefore, conclude that we ſhall be <hi>eternally damned?</hi> Will he take upon him to pronounce damnation againſt us, for not doing thoſe things, which he himſelf acknowledges were impoſſible by us to be done? It is our opinion that every man is poſſeſſed of ſufficient knowledge for his ſalvation. The <hi>Almighty,</hi> for any thing we know, may have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated the knowledge of himſelf to a different race of people, in a different manner.</p>
                        <p>"Some ſay, they have the will of God in <hi>writing:</hi> be it ſo; their <hi>revelation</hi> has no advantage above ours; ſince both muſt be equally ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſave; otherwiſe the end of the revelation would be fruſtrated. Beſides, if they be both true, they muſt be the ſame in ſubſtance; and the difference can only lie in the mode of communication He tells us there are many precepts in his <hi>written revelation,</hi> which we are entirely ignorant of But theſe <hi>written commands</hi> can only be deſigned for thoſe, who have the <hi>writings;</hi> they cannot poſſibly regard us. Had the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty</hi> thought ſo much knowledge neceſſary to our ſalvation, his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs would not long have deferred the communication of it to us; and to ſay, that, in a matter ſo neceſſary, he could not, at one and the ſame time, equally reveal himſelf to all mankind, is nothing leſs than an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute denial of his omnipotence. Without doubt he can make his will manifeſt, without the help of any <hi>book,</hi> or the aſſiſtance of any <hi>bookiſh man</hi> whatever.</p>
                        <p>"We ſhall, in the next place, conſider the arguments, which ariſe from a conſideration of <hi>Providence.</hi> If we are the work of God, (which I preſume will not be denied) it follows from thence, that we are under the care and protection of God: for, it cannot be ſuppoſed that the <hi>Deity</hi> ſhould abandon his own creatures, and be utterly regardleſs of their welfare. Then, to ſay, that the <hi>Almighty</hi> hath permitted us to remain in a fatal error, through ſo many ages, is to repreſent him as a tyrant: how is it conſiſtent with his juſtice, to force life upon a race of mortals, without their conſent, and then <hi>damn them eternally,</hi> without ever opening to them a door of ſalvation? Our conceptions of the <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God</hi> are more noble; and we think that thoſe, who teach otherwiſe, do little leſs than <hi>blaſpheme.</hi> Again, it is through the care and goodneſs of the <hi>Almighty,</hi> that from the beginning of time, through many gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, to this day, our name has been preſerved, unblotted out by ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, unreduced to nothing. By the ſame care we now enjoy our lives; are furniſhed with the neceſſary means of preſerving thoſe lives. But all theſe things are trifling, compared with our ſalvation.</p>
                        <p>"Therefore, ſince God hath been ſo careful of us, in matters of little conſequence, it would be abſurd to affirm, that he has neglected us, in caſes of the greateſt importance. Admit, that he hath forſaken us, yet it could not have been without a juſt cauſe. Let us ſuppoſe, that an <hi>heinous crime</hi> was committed by one of our anceſtors, like to that, which we are told, happened among another race of people; in ſuch caſe, God would certainly puniſh the <hi>criminal,</hi> but would never involve us, who are innocent, in his guilt. Thoſe who think otherwiſe muſt make the <hi>Almighty</hi> a very <hi>whimſical, ill-natured being.</hi> Once more, are the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> more virtuous? or, rather, are they not more vicious, than we are? If ſo, how came it to paſs, that they are the objects of God's beneficence, while we are neglected? Does the Deity confer his favours without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and with ſo much partiality? in a word, we find the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> much more depraved, in their morals, than ourſelves; and we judge of their doctrine by the <hi>badneſs of their lives."</hi>

                           <pb n="317" facs="unknown:034421_0317_0FFDA10106BABB88"/>In the year 1737, I was ſent, the firſt time, to <hi>Onondago,</hi> at the deſire of the Governor of <hi>Virginia.</hi> I departed in the latter end of February, very unexpectedly, for a journey of five hundred <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles, through a wilderneſs, where there was neither road nor path, and at ſuch a time of the year, when creatures (animals) could not be met with, for food. There were with me a <hi>Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> and three <hi>Indians.</hi> After we had gone one hundred and fifty miles on our journey, we came to a narrow valley, about half a mile broad, and thirty long; both ſides of which were encompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with high mountains; on which the ſnow laid about three feet deep: in it ran a ſtream of water, alſo about three feet deep; which was ſo crooked, that it kept a continued winding courſe from one ſide of the valley to the other. In order to avoid wading ſo often through the water, we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to paſs along on the ſlope of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; the ſnow being three feet deep, and ſo hard frozen, on the top, that we could walk upon it: but we were obliged to make holes in the ſnow with our hatchets, that our feet might not ſlip down the mountain; and thus we crept on. It happened that the <hi>old Indian</hi>'s foot ſlipt; and the root of a tree, by which he held, breaking, he ſlid down the mountain, as from the roof of a houſe; but happily he was ſtopped in his fall, by the ſtring, which faſtened his pack, hitching on the ſtump of a ſmall tree. The other two <hi>Indians</hi> could not go to his aid, but our <hi>Dutch</hi> fellow-tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller did; yet not without viſible danger of his own life. I alſo could not put a foot forward, till I was helped; after this we took the firſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to deſcend into the valley; which was not till after we had laboured hard for half an hour with hands and feet. Having obſerved a tree ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing directly off, from where the <hi>Indian</hi> fell, when we were got into the valley again, we went back
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:034421_0318_0FFDA0F1E91E5E00"/>
about one hundred paces, where we ſaw, that if the <hi>Indian</hi> had ſlipt four or five paces further, he would have fallen over a rock, one hundred feet perpendicular, upon craggy pieces of rocks below. The <hi>Indian</hi> was aſtoniſhed, and turned quite pale; then with out-ſtretched arms, and great earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he ſpoke theſe words: <hi>"I thank the great Lord and Governor of this world, in that he has had mercy upon me, and has been willing that I ſhould live longer."</hi> Which words I, at that time, put down in my journal: this happened on the 25th of March, 1737.</p>
                        <p>In the 9th of April following, while we were yet on our journey, I found myſelf extremely weak, through the fatigue of ſo long a journey, with the cold and hunger, which I had ſuffered; there having fallen a freſh ſnow about twenty inches deep, and we being yet three days journey from <hi>Onondago,</hi> in a frightful wilderneſs; my ſpirit failed, my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy trembled and ſhook; I thought I ſhould fall down and die; I ſtept aſide, and ſat down under a tree, expecting there to die. My companions ſoon miſſed me; the <hi>Indians</hi> came back, and found me ſitting there. They remained awhile ſilent; at laſt, the old <hi>Indian</hi> ſaid, "My dear companion, thou haſt hitherto encouraged us, wilt thou now quite give up? remember that evil days are better than good days: for when we ſuffer much, we do not ſin; ſin will be driven out of us by ſuffering: but good days cauſe men to ſin; and God cannot extend his mercy to them; but contrarywiſe, when it goeth evil with us, God hath compaſſion upon us." Theſe words made me aſhamed; I roſe up, and travelled as well as I could.</p>
                        <p>The next year I went another journey to <hi>Onondago,</hi> in company with <hi>Joſeph Spanhenberg</hi> and two others. It happened that an <hi>Indian</hi> came to us in the evening, who had neither ſhoes, ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:034421_0319_0FFDA102898A4E78"/>
ſhirt, gun, knife, nor hatchet; in a word, he had nothing but an old torn blanket, and ſome rags. Upon enquiring whither he was going, he anſwered to <hi>Onondago.</hi> I knew him, and aſked him how he could undertake a journey of three hundred miles ſo naked and unprovided, having no proviſions, nor any arms, to kill creatures, for his ſuſtenance? He anſwered, he had been among enemies, and had been obliged to ſave himſelf by flight; and ſo had loſt all. This was true, in part; for he had diſpoſed of ſome of his things among the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> for ſtrong liquors. Upon fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther talk, he told me very chearfully; "That <hi>God</hi> fed every thing, which had life, even, the rattle ſnake itſelf, though it was a bad creature; and that <hi>God</hi> would alſo provide, in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that he ſhould get alive to <hi>Onondago;</hi> he knew for certain that he ſhould go thither; that it was viſible <hi>God</hi> was with the <hi>Indians,</hi> in the wilderneſs; becauſe they always caſt their care upon him; but that, contrary to this, the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans always carried bread with them." He was an <hi>Onondago Indian;</hi> his name was <hi>Onontagketa;</hi> the next day we travelled in company; and the day following I provided him with a knife, hatchet, flint, and tinder, alſo ſhoes and ſtockings, and ſent him before me, to give notice to the council, at <hi>Onondago,</hi> that I was coming; which he truly performed, being got thither three days before us.</p>
                        <p>Two years ago I was ſent by the Governor to <hi>Shamokin,</hi> on account of the unhappy death of <hi>John Armſtrong,</hi> the <hi>Indian trader,</hi> (about 1744). After I had performed my errand, there was a feaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared; to which the Governor's meſſengers were invited: there were about one hundred perſons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to whom, after we had, in great ſilence, devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a fat bear, the eldeſt of the chiefs made a ſpeech, in which he ſaid, "That, by a great misfortune, three of their brethren, the <hi>white men,</hi> had been
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:034421_0320_0FFDA0A215FAFBD0"/>
killed by an <hi>Indian;</hi> that nevertheleſs the ſun was not ſet, (meaning there was no war); it had only been ſomewhat darkened by a ſmall cloud, which was now done away; he that had done evil was like to be puniſhed, and the land to remain in peace: therefore he exhorted his people to <hi>thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to God;</hi> and thereupon he began to ſing with an awful ſolemnity, but without expreſſing any words; the others accompanied him with their voices: after they had done, the ſame <hi>Indian,</hi> with great earneſtneſs, or fervour, ſpoke theſe words; <hi>"Thanks, thanks, be to thee, thou great Lord of the world, in that thou haſt again cauſed the ſun to ſhine, and haſt diſperſed the dark cloud; —the Indians are thine.</hi>

He refuſed the preſents, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Governor, and gave him the reaſons; further ſaying: "I think on God, who made us; I want to be inſtructed in his worſhip and ſervice; I am a great lover of peace, and have never been concerned in war affairs; I have a ſincere remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the <hi>old friendſhip</hi> between the <hi>Indians</hi> and your <hi>forefathers,</hi> and ſhall ever obſerve it." After mentioning ſome other things, and expreſſing himſelf further on the view, or deſign, of their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit, on a religious account, he ſaid, "Though what he had mentioned reſpecting religious affairs might appear trivial to ſome, who thought differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from him, yet he was fixed in his mind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting them; that their young men agreed with him, and wanted to love God, and to deſiſt from their former bad courſe of life;" further declaring, "I am glad I have an opportunity of mentioning theſe ſeveral affairs in the preſence of ſuch a large auditory of young and old people; the great God obſerves all that paſſes in our hearts, and hears all that we ſay one to another," &amp;c.

all the while, behaved with a gravity and deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment becoming the occaſion, and appeared to unite heartily with him, in his devotion.</p>
                  <p>They were kindly treated by the Governor, and remained in town afterwards ſeveral days, viſiting and conferring with divers of the <hi>Friends,</hi> or <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> and attending their religious meetings, while they ſtaid; who behaved towards them in a kind, hoſpitable and friendly manner. They repeatedly expreſſed their great diſlike and abhorrence of war, as ariſing from a bad ſpirit, admiring that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were ſuch great warriors, rather than lovers and cultivators of peace, &amp;c. They kept themſelves entirely from ſtrong liquor, and uniformly obſerved a ſober, orderly and commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able behaviour, often expreſſing their ſatisfaction with what they heard from the Friends.</p>
                  <p>From the account, they gave of themſelves, they had been of this mind for ſeveral years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this time; and, as far as appeared, and was underſtood by thoſe they viſited, principally from an immediate ſenſe of divine goodneſs, manifeſted in their minds, without any inſtrumental means, preaching, or information from other perſons; yet, it was but lately, that in a more eſpecial manner they had been thus diſpoſed, and that <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounan</hi> had been induced to preach among them; in which ſervice he was afterwards joined by two or three other Indians. They appeared very earneſt and ſincere in promoting true piety; which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, according to their apprehenſion of it, to be the effect of an internal operation of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine influence on the mind; whereby it became changed from a bad to a good ſtate: this they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically expreſſed by <hi>the heart becoming ſoft, and filled with good,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The interpreter gave the following a count of <hi>Papunehung</hi>'s change, or converſion, <hi>viz.</hi> "He

was formerly a drunken man; but the death of his father bringing ſorrow over his mind, he fell into a thoughtful, melancholic ſtate; in which his eyes were turned to behold the earth, and conſider the things which are thereon; from ſeeing the folly and wickedneſs, which prevailed, his ſorrow increaſed; and it was given him to believe, there was a great power, which had created all theſe things. Upon which his mind was turned from beholding this lower world, to look towards him, who had created it; and ſtrong deſires were raiſed in his heart after the further knowledge of his <hi>Creator:</hi> nevertheleſs the <hi>Almighty</hi> was not yet pleaſed to be found, or known, by him. But his deſires increaſing, he forſook the town, and went into the woods, in great bitterneſs of ſpirit. He was miſſed by the other <hi>Indians,</hi> who feared ſome caſualty might have happened to him, but after ſearching for him, he was not found. At the end of five days it pleaſed God to appear to him, to his comfort; and to give him a ſight not only of his own inward ſtate, but alſo an acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or knowledge, into the works of nature: ſo that he apprehended a ſenſe was given him of the virtues and natures of ſeveral herbs, roots, plants, trees, with the different relation they had one to another; and he was made ſenſible that man ſtood in the neareſt relation to God, of any part of the creation. It was at this time that he was more particularly made ſenſible of his duty to God. He came home rejoicing, and endeavoured to put in practice what he apprehended was required of him," &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Indians</hi> made a ſecond viſit to the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> in the next following ſummer, on the ſame account, and behaved in the ſame regular and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming manner as before. They maintained an orderly public worſhip, in their way, at ſtated times: at ſome of which they were viſited by ſeveral

of the Friends. <hi>Papunehung,</hi> their chief preacher, in his diſcourſes, at ſuch times, principally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed and exhorted them to circumſpection, and brotherly love, in their conduct; that it might be manifeſt they retained a true ſenſe of their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's goodneſs and favour continued to them; and in his public prayers and addreſſes to his Maker, he acknowledged, and returned thanks for, his mercy, in ſtill affording them a ſenſe of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion and loving kindneſs, requeſting a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and increaſe thereof; that they might jointly know, in the end, a place of reſt, where love would prevail and have the dominion. When they were not diſperſed, as in their hunting ſeaſon, it appeared, they conſtantly met in this manner, in the morning, before ſun-riſe, and in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, after ſun-ſet.</p>
                  <p>The purport of more of Papunehung's expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions was, "That it was an affair of much ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to him, that men ſhould make ſo bad uſe of the breath of life, which God had breathed into them; and which ought continually to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved to his honour, and the mutual benefit of mankind; that it was not well to ſpeak of things, which related to the <hi>Almighty,</hi> only from the root of the tongue; (meaning, in a ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, or inſenſible, manner) but, in order that ſuch words ſhould be good, they muſt proceed from the good principle in the heart; that he had, for many years, felt the good ſpirit in his heart; but, wanting to try and prove it, in order to come to ſome certainty, he remained in an unſettled ſtate, till about four years ago, when he received an aſſurance, that this love was good, and that he needed no further enquiry about it; and being paſt all doubt, that this was the right way, he had endeavoured to walk ſteadily therein ſince that time; this ſpirit was a ſpirit of love; and that it was his daily prayer, that it might continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:034421_0325_0FFD7A152CA84428"/>
abide with him. That when he felt it preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in his heart, he was ſo directed, as to ſpeak what was right, and prevented from ſaying any wrong thing; that by reaſon of men not keeping to this love, which their Maker hath given them, in their hearts, the evil ſpirit gets poſſeſſion there, and deſtroys all that is good in them; and this is the cauſe why men diſlike one another, grow an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with, and endeavour to kill, one another; but when we follow the leadings of the good ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, it cauſes our hearts to be tender, to love one another, to look upon all mankind as one, and ſo to become as one family," &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>That ſtrict amity between the <hi>Indians</hi> and the firſt and early <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſettlers of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> and <hi>New Jerſey,</hi> and their ſucceſſors, for above ſeventy years, with the means of fixing and preſerving that friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, have already been occaſionally mentioned in the courſe of the preceding hiſtory.

                        </p>
                        <p>"This treaty has been ſince frequently renewed, and the <hi>chain bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened,</hi> as they expreſs it, from time to time. It has never been violated, on their part, or ours, till now. As their lands, by degrees, were moſtly purchaſed, and the ſettlement of the <hi>white people</hi> began to ſurround them, the Proprietor aſſigned them lands on the <hi>manor</hi> of <hi>Coneſtogoe,</hi> which they might not part with; there they have lived many years, in <hi>friendſhip</hi> with their <hi>white neighbours,</hi> who loved them for their peaceable, inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive behaviour.</p>
                        <p>"It has always been obſerved, that <hi>Indians,</hi> ſettled in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of <hi>white people,</hi> do not increaſe, but diminiſh continually.

                        <p>"Of theſe <hi>Shehaes</hi> was a very old man, having aſſiſted at the ſecond treaty, held with them by <hi>Mr. Penn,</hi> in 1701; and ever ſince continued a faithful friend to the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> he is ſaid to have been an exceeding good man, conſidering his education, being naturally of a moſt kind, bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent temper.</p>
                        <p>—"This little ſociety continued the cuſtom they had begun, when more numerous, of addreſſing every new <hi>Governor,</hi> and every <hi>deſcendant</hi> of the firſt <hi>Proprietary,</hi> welcoming him to the province, aſſuring him of their fidelity, and praying a continuance of that favour and protection, which they had hitherto experienced. They had accordingly ſent up an addreſs of this kind to our preſent Governor (<hi>John Penn,</hi> Eſquire) on his arrival; but the ſame was ſcarce delivered when the unfortunate ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtrophe happened, which we are about to relate.</p>
                        <p>"On Wedneſday, the 14th of December, 1763, fifty-ſeven men, from ſome of our frontier townſhips, who had projected the deſtruction of this little commonwealth, came all well mounted, and armed with fire-locks, hangers and hatchets, having travelled through the country in the night to <hi>Coneſtogoe manor.</hi> There they ſurrounded the ſmall vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage of <hi>Indian</hi> huts, and juſt at break of day, broke in upon them all at once. Only three men, two women, and a young boy were found at home; the reſt being out among the neighbouring <hi>white people;</hi> ſome to ſell their baſkets, brooms and bowls, they manufactured, and others on other occaſions. Theſe poor defenceleſs creatures were immediately fired upon, ſtabbed and hatcheted to death! The good <hi>Shehaes,</hi> among the reſt, cut to pieces in his bed! All of them were <hi>ſcalped,</hi> and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>horribly mangled.</hi> Then their huts were ſet on fire, and moſt of them burnt down.</p>
                        <p>"The Magiſtrates of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> ſent out to collect the remaining <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> brought them into the town, for their better ſecurity againſt any further attempt; and, it is ſaid, condoled with them, on the misfortune, that had happened, took them by the hand, and <hi>promiſed them protection.</hi>

                        <p>"They were put into the work-houſe, a ſtrong building, as the place of greateſt ſafety.</p>

Fifty of them armed as before, diſmounting, went directly to the work-houſe, and by violence broke open the door, and entered with the utmoſt fury in their countenances. When the poor wretches ſaw they had <hi>no protection</hi> nigh, nor could poſſibly eſcape, and being without the leaſt weapon of defence, they divided their little families, the children cling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their parents; they fell on their faces, proteſted their innocence, declared their love to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and that, in their whole lives, they had never done them injury; and in this poſture, they all received the hatchet!

                        <p>"The bodies of the murdered were then brought out, and expoſed in the ſtreet, till a hole could be made in the earth, to receive and cover them. But the wickedneſs cannot be covered, and the guilt will lie on the whole land, till juſtice is done on the <hi>murderers. The blood of the innocent will cry to heaven for vengeance.</hi>

                        <p>"But it ſeems theſe people (being chiefly Preſbyterians) think they have a better juſtification—nothing leſs than the <hi>word of God.</hi> With the ſcriptures in their hands and mouths they can ſet at nought that expreſs command, <hi>"Thou ſhalt do no murder,"</hi> and juſtify their wickedneſs by the command given <hi>Joſhua,</hi> to deſtroy the <hi>Heathen!</hi> Horrid perverſion of ſcripture and of religion! to father the worſt of crimes on the <hi>God of love and peace!</hi>

                  <p>"The bloody ſcene was compleated in the town of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> itſelf; where the remainder of the tribe, which had eſcaped the firſt ſlaughter, taking refuge, declaring their innocence, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for mercy and protection, were through the connivance, if not the encouragement, of the <hi>Chriſtian-profeſſing</hi> Magiſtrates, and other princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal perſons of that town, all inhumanly butchered, in cold blood, even infants at the breaſt, by the ſame party of armed <hi>ruffians,</hi> at mid-day, without oppoſition, or the leaſt moleſtation!—to the laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infamy of the inhabitants of that place, who had power ſufficient to prevent it!"</p>
                  <p>With hands imbrued in innocent blood, and taking courage from their unoppoſed ſucceſs and cruelty, the inſurgents now greatly increaſed in number, and proceeded towards <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> with avowed intention to cut off a party of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and friendly <hi>Indians</hi> there; conſiſting of thoſe of <hi>Wyaluſing,</hi> before mentioned, and ſome others; who had thrown themſelves under the protection of the government, to the number of about one hundred and forty.

in all probability, they would have effected their bloody purpoſe, had they not met with ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and vigorous oppoſition from the government, and the inhabitants of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> as they ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to expect; which put a ſtop to their career. But ſo far was the contagion ſpread, and ſo deeply had the ſpirit of faction infected the minds of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that the weakneſs of the government was not able to puniſh theſe <hi>murderers,</hi> nor to chaſtiſe the inſurgents! a ſorrowful preſage of an approaching change in that happy conſtitution, which had ſo long afforded a peaceable aſylum to the unjuſtly oppreſſed and diſtreſſed, by means of the great influx and increaſe of ſuch kind of people into it, of later years, as experience has abundantly demonſtrated a rod of iron is more proper to rule, than ſuch a mild eſtabliſhment, as is better adapted to promote the proſperity of the virtuous and good, than properly to chaſtiſe the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate of mankind; more calculated to make men happy, than to puniſh the wicked and ungoverna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, according to their demerits.</p>

                        <hi>James Logan,</hi> who died in 1751, was the Proprietary's Secretary, and principal Agent, or commiſſioner, for land affairs, for near forty years.</note> if not ſome time before, a very different conduct was too much practiſed towards that people, from that which formerly had never failed to gain and preſerve their friendſhip and alliance.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Quakers,</hi> whom the <hi>Indians</hi> regarded from the beginning, above any other people in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, were excluded from the Proprietary agency, to which the management of their affairs was

chiefly committed; though they were, for the above reaſon, of all perſons the moſt proper to be concerned, or to act, in it.</p>
                  <p>But there were ſeveral cauſes, which admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered to the unhappy rupture, which may be ſeen,<note place="margin">Cauſes of the Indian war, &amp;c. in 1754, &amp;c.</note> as mentioned in a treatiſe, publiſhed in <hi>London,</hi> in 1759, written in <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> entitled, <hi>"An en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into the cauſes of the alienation of the Delaware and Shawaneſe Indians, from the Britiſh intereſt,"</hi> &amp;c. And, in the whole, it is certain they had been too much neglected; of which the <hi>French,</hi> then at war with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> made their advantage.</p>
                  <p>The principal cauſes of the quarrel and aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe <hi>Indians</hi> were aſſerted to be,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> The abuſes committed in the <hi>Indian trade;</hi> which had been, more or leſs, of long continuance, and very difficult to be properly regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, or redreſſed; though doubtleſs a great part of them might have been better guarded againſt, and prevented, than they really were.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>Governor <hi>Thomas,</hi> in a meſſage to the Aſſembly of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> in 1744, ſays, "I cannot but be apprehenſive that the <hi>Indian</hi> trade, as it is now carried on, will involve us in ſome fatal quarrel with the <hi>Indians.</hi> Our traders, in defiance of the laws, carry ſpirituous liquors among them, and take the advantage of their inordinate appetite for it, to cheat them of their <hi>ſkins,</hi> and their <hi>wampum,</hi> which is their money, and often debauch their wives into the bargain. Is it to be wondered at, then, if, when they recover from their drunken fit, they ſhould take ſome ſevere revenges? If I am rightly informed, the like abuſes of the traders in <hi>New England,</hi> were the principal cauſes of the <hi>Indian</hi> wars there; and at length obliged the government to take the trade into their own hands. This is a matter, that well deſerves your attention, and perhaps, will ſoon require your imitation."</p>
                        <p>The author of <hi>the enquiry</hi> into the cauſe of the alienation of the <hi>Indians,</hi> &amp;c. above mentioned, further obſerves on this part, "It would be too ſhocking to deſcribe the conduct, and behaviour of the traders, when among the <hi>Indians,</hi> and endleſs to enumerate the abuſes, the <hi>Indians</hi> had received and borne from them, for a ſeries of years, ſuffice it to ſay that ſeveral of the tribes were, at laſt, weary of bearing," &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>At a treaty, held with the <hi>Ohio Indians,</hi> at <hi>Carliſle,</hi> in <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> by Commiſſioners, appointed by Governor <hi>Hamilton,</hi> in the year 1753, the former ſay,</p>
                        <p>"Brother Onas (which means <hi>Pen,</hi> the name given by them to the Governors of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi>) your traders now bring ſcarce any thing but <hi>rum</hi> and <hi>flour;</hi> they bring but little powder and lead, and other valuable goods. The rum ruins us. We beg you would prevent its coming in ſuch quantities, by regulating the traders. We never underſtood the trade was to be for <hi>whiſky</hi> and <hi>flour.</hi> We deſire it may be forbidden, and none ſold in the <hi>Indian</hi> country; but that, if the <hi>Indians</hi> will have any, they may go among the inhabitants, and deal with them for it. When theſe <hi>whiſky traders</hi> come, they bring thirty or forty cags, and put them down before us, and make us drink; and get all the ſkins, that ſhould go to pay the debts, we have contracted for goods, bought of the fair trader; and by theſe means we not only ruin ourſelves, but them too. Theſe wicked <hi>whiſky ſellers,</hi> when they have once got the <hi>Indians</hi> in liquor, make them ſell their very clothes from their backs. In ſhort, if this practice be continued we muſt be inevitably ruined; we moſt earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly, therefore, beſeech you to remedy it."</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>"The fact was, this <hi>Weekquehela</hi> was an <hi>Indian</hi> of great note and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, both among the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> of the tribe that reſided about <hi>South River,</hi> (near <hi>Shrewſbury</hi> in <hi>Eaſt Jerſey</hi>), where he lived with a taſte much above the common rank of <hi>Indians,</hi> having an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive farm, cattle, horſes, negroes, and raiſed large crops of wheat; and was ſo far <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in his furniture, as to have a houſe well provided with feather beds, calico curtains, &amp;c.

                        <p>But the <hi>Indians</hi> of the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> at a meeting in <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> with Governor <hi>Denny,</hi> &amp;c. May 29th, 1757, ſay thus,</p>
                        <p>"Brothers, ſome years ago, in the <hi>Jerſeys,</hi> one of the head men of the <hi>Delawares</hi> had been out a hunting. On his return, he called to ſee a gentleman, a great friend of his, one of your people; whom he found in the field; when the gentleman ſaw him, he came to meet him. It was rainy weather, and the <hi>Delaware</hi> chief had his gun under his arm; they met at a fence, and as they reached out their hands to each other, the <hi>Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware</hi>'s gun went off, by accident, and ſhot him dead. He was very much grieved, went to the houſe, and told the gentleman's wife what had happened; and ſaid, he was willing to die, and did not chuſe to live after his friend. She immediately ſent for a number of the inhabitants: when they were gathered, ſome ſaid, it was an accident, and could not be helped; but the greateſt number were for hanging him; and he was taken by the Sheriff, and carried to <hi>Amboy,</hi> where he was tried and hanged.</p>
                        <p>"There was another misfortune that happened: A party of <hi>Shawa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe,</hi> who were going to war againſt their enemies, in their way through <hi>Carolina,</hi> called at a houſe, not ſuſpecting any harm, as they were among their friends: a number of the inhabitants roſe, and took them priſoners, on account of ſome miſchief which was done there about that time; ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting them to be the people who had done the miſchief; and carried them to <hi>Charleſtown,</hi> and put them in priſon, where the chief man, called <hi>The Pride,</hi> died. The relations of theſe people were much exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated againſt you, our brothers, the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> on account of the ill treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you gave their friends; and have been continually ſpiriting up their nations to take revenge.</p>
                        <p>"Brothers, you deſired us to open our hearts, and inform you of every thing we know, that might give riſe to the quarrel between you and our nephews and brothers:—That, in former times, our forefathers conquered the <hi>Delawares,</hi> and put petticoats on them; a long time after that, they lived among you, our brothers; but, upon ſome difference between you and them, we thought proper to remove them, giving them lands to plant and hunt on, at <hi>Wioming</hi> and <hi>Juniata,</hi> on <hi>Suſquahanna;</hi> but you, covetous of land, made plantations there, and ſpoiled their hunting grounds; they then complained to us, and we looked over thoſe lands, and found their complaints to be true.</p>
                        <p>"At this time they carried on a correſpondence with the <hi>French;</hi> by which means the <hi>French</hi> became acquainted with all the cauſes of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint they had againſt you; and as your people were daily increaſing their ſettlements, by theſe means you drove them back into the arms of the <hi>French;</hi> and they took the advantage of ſpiriting them up againſt you, by telling them, <hi>"Children,</hi> you ſee, and we have often told you, how the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> your brothers, would ſerve you; they plant all the country, and drive you back; ſo that, in a little time, you will have no land: it is not ſo with us; though we build trading houſes on your land, we do not plant it; we have our proviſions from over the great water."</p>
                        <p>"We have opened our hearts, and told you what complaints we have heard, that they had againſt you; and our advice to you is, that you ſend for the <hi>Senecas</hi> and <hi>them;</hi> treat them kindly, and rather give them ſome part of their fields back again, than differ with them.

               <p>IT has already been obſerved that the civil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> was originally founded on ſuch a generous plan of liberty, that the freedom allowed by it, of <hi>thinking on religious ſubjects,</hi>

               <p>There is a greater number of different religious ſocieties in this province, than, perhaps,<note place="margin">Numerous ſects in Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</note> in any other, throughout the <hi>Britiſh</hi> dominions beſides; and in regard to diſputes, on religious ſubjects, and the conſequences of an univerſal toleration of all the varieties of opinion, in religion, though ſo widely different, and ſo contrary and oppoſite to

               <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Concluſion reſpecting variety of religious opinions, &amp;c.</note>AS it is not my intention to ſay any thing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, reſpecting the more generally well known forms of the other religious ſocieties, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, which, at different times, have reſulted from a variety of opinion, on the ſubject of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, I ſhall, therefore, only obſerve, that, ſo long as different degrees of light and knowledge are communicated to men, while cuſtom and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation vary among them, and while the capacity and opportunity to receive inſtruction are unequal and various in individuals, according to their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent abilities and ſituations in the world, ſo long it cannot reaſonably be expected that all people ſhould ſee or think exactly alike, or poſſeſs an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of underſtanding, in objects merely intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual, more eſpecially ſuch as are only known to exiſt in opinion, or belief: for as our bodies dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in ſhape, ſize and capacity, and vary in their properties and qualities, ſo is it in reſpect to the minds of men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which are as various as the flowers of the field; and, when duly conſidered, have no leſs real beauty, in their variety: it is as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable to expect, or attempt, an abſolute uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of the one as of the other; and compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in ſuch caſe, would be no leſs tyrannical and abſurd, than the uſe of <hi>Procruſtes</hi>'s bed; for the nature of all ſects, in religion, is to keep up the difference.</p>
               <p>But, as wiſdom is better than ſtrength, and the cauſe above the effect, ſo the power of reaſon and perſuaſion alone, on the intelligent and rational mind, is the moſt adequate and proper to rectify the erroneous, or leſs informed underſtanding, in objects entirely of a mental or intellectual na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; in which a difference of thinking may not be inconſiſtent with reaſon and truth; for perhaps,
<pb n="357" facs="unknown:034421_0357_0FFDA0E6488A5338"/>
as light and knowledge increaſe and advance among mankind, the greater will be the variety of ſentiment? Which, ſo long as it is free, may have the more effectual tendency to diſcuſs and diſcriminate truth from error, and that not incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with an unity of principle, even, in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſubjects; provided that men, inſtead of wickedly making religion an engine of power, for one part of the community to oppreſs the other, would keep within the bounds of mental purſuits only, in their pretenſions to things of this kind, and clear of all ſelfiſh and ambitious news, artifice, and party-deſign; this has ever been inſtanced in the wiſeſt and moſt civilized na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and in the progreſs of arts and ſciences. For, though the firſt principles of things are but few, and theſe all ultimately terminate in unity, yet like the rays of light, from the ſolar luminary, which reflect an infinite variety of appearances, and ſo much the more, the leſs they are obſcured and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, ſo the greater the diverſity of effect from theſe principles, the more is the eternal wiſdom diſplayed, in any one part of the creation.</p>
               <p>In regard to the final iſſue of the various opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a religious nature, among mankind, with their Creator, and of the many different cuſtoms ariſing from them, (than the loweſt and moſt abſurd of which, as well as the moſt rational and ſublime, perhaps, nothing ſhews more the weakneſs of the human race, and its abſolute dependance on a <hi>Superior Being</hi>) why may we not conclude, that, as a perſon of ſuperior wiſdom and ſagacity, or of better information than others, ſometimes obſerves and conſiders the diſagreements and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, between perſons of different judgment, or education, and inferior knowledge, but of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere mind and intention, whether in the low and common affairs of life, or on things of a ſuperior
<pb n="358" facs="unknown:034421_0358_0FFEA8513B627BF0"/>
and mental nature, on which they ſeem ſo widely to differ in opinion, that, by their manner of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging their arguments, or diſputes, they would probably never agree; nay, inſtead of uniting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſometimes their oppoſition of ſentiment may render them ſo much the more poſitive and tenacious of their different opinions, as to become highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed againſt each other (which is often the caſe with the more ignorant) becauſe they do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the ſubjects of diſpute all alike; yet, by his greater penetration and underſtanding of the affair in diſpute, he plainly perceives they all mean, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, the ſame thing, in the main; and their views all center to one point, or what appears to them right, (though if left to themſelves they would probably never agree) that they all are proportionably right; and, when properly underſtood, differ only either in circumſtantials, or on account of their various degrees of underſtanding and conception, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſuch information as each is poſſeſſed of, or by reaſon of the different mediums of edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and cuſtom, through which they ſee; whence he may pity their ignorance, and perhaps blame their animoſity, which ariſes from it; but cannot juſtly cenſure them for any thing, that is providenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally out of their power: ſo, who will deny that the great <hi>Creator</hi> of mankind, who ſees and knows all things, looks down upon his creatures, whom he has proportionably endowed with <hi>reaſon,</hi> and the proper <hi>means</hi> of anſwering the end of their exiſtence, and, in his great <hi>wiſdom,</hi> beholds how zealous they are to pleaſe him, and obtain felicity; which they all aim at, according to the different degrees of knowledge, capacity and ability afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them? I ſay, who will venture to deny, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their great diſparity, diſagreement, ſeeming inconſiſtency and the many contrary cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, uſed by men, for that purpoſe (divers of which to one another, and not without reaſon,

               <argument>
                  <p>Certain <hi>conditions,</hi> or <hi>conceſſions,</hi> agreed upon by <hi>William Penn,</hi> Proprietary and Governor of the province of Pennſylvania, and thoſe who are the adventurers and purchaſers in the ſame province, the eleventh of July, one thouſand ſix hundred and eighty-one.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">I. THAT ſo ſoon as it pleaſeth God that the aboveſaid perſons arrive there, a certain quantity of land, or ground plat, ſhall be laid out, for a large town or city, in the moſt convenient place, upon the river, for health and navigation; and every purchaſer and adventurer ſhall, by lot, have ſo much land therein as will anſwer to the proportion, which he hath bought, or taken up,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:034421_0375_0FFEA8A2081A7680"/>
upon rent: but it is to be noted, that the ſurveyors ſhall conſider what roads or high-ways will be neceſſary to the cities, towns, or through the lands. Great roads from city to city not to contain leſs than <hi>forty</hi> feet, in breadth, ſhall be firſt laid out and declared to be for high-ways, before the dividend of acres be laid out for the purchaſer, and the like obſervation to be had for the ſtreets in the towns and cities, that there may be convenient roads and ſtreets preſerved, not to be encroached upon by any planter or builder, that none may build irregularly to the damage of another. <hi>In this, cuſtom governs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. That the land in the town be laid out together after the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of <hi>ten thouſand</hi> acres of the whole country, that is, <hi>two hundred</hi> acres, if the place will bear it: however, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion be by lot, and entire, ſo as thoſe that deſire to be toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, eſpecially thoſe that are, by the catalogue, laid together, may be ſo laid together both in the town and country.</p>
               <p n="3">III. That, when the country lots are laid out, every purchaſer, from <hi>one thouſand,</hi> to <hi>ten thouſand</hi> acres, or more, not to have above <hi>one thouſand</hi> acres together, unleſs in <hi>three</hi> years they plant a family upon every <hi>thouſand</hi> acres; but that all ſuch as purchaſe together, lie together; and, if as many as comply with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that the whole be laid out together.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. That, where any number of purchaſers, more or leſs, whoſe number of acres amounts to <hi>five</hi> or <hi>ten thouſand</hi> acres, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſit together in a lot, or townſhip, they ſhall have their lot, or townſhip, caſt together, in ſuch places as have convenient har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, or navigable rivers attending it, if ſuch can be found; and in caſe any one or more purchaſers plant not according to agreement, in this conceſſion, to the prejudice of others of the ſame townſhip, upon complaint thereof made to the Governor, or his Deputy, with aſſiſtance, they may award (if they ſee cauſe) that the complaining purchaſer may, paying the ſurvey money, and purchaſe money, and intereſt thereof, be entitled, enrolled and lawfully inveſted, in the lands ſo not ſeated.</p>
               <p n="5">V. That the proportion of lands, that ſhall be laid out in the firſt great town, or city, for every purchaſer, ſhall be after the proportion of <hi>ten</hi> acres for every <hi>five hundred</hi> acres purchaſed, if the place will allow it.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. That notwithſtanding there be no mention made, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral deeds made to the purchaſers; yet the ſaid <hi>William Penn</hi> does accord and declare, that all rivers, rivulets, woods, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwoods, waters, watercourſes, quarries, mines, and minerals,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:034421_0376_0FFDA0B4293C0F90"/>
(except mines royal) ſhall be freely and fully enjoyed, and wholly by the purchaſers, into whoſe lot they fall.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. That, for every <hi>fifty</hi> acres, that ſhall be allotted to a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, at the end of his ſervice, his quit-rent ſhall be <hi>two ſhillings</hi> per annum, and the maſter, or owner of the ſervant, when he ſhall take up the other <hi>fifty acres,</hi> his quit-rent, ſhall be <hi>four ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi> by the year, or, if the maſter of the ſervant (by reaſon in the indentures he is ſo obliged to do) allot out to the ſervant <hi>fifty</hi> acres in his own diviſion, the ſaid maſter ſhall have, on demand, allotted him, from the Governor, the <hi>one hundred</hi> acres, at the chief rent of ſix ſhillings per annum.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. And, for the encouragement of ſuch as are ingenious and willing to ſearch out gold and ſilver mines in this province, it is hereby agreed, that they have liberty to bore and dig in any man's property, fully paying the damage done; and in caſe a diſcovery ſhould be made, that the diſcoverer have <hi>one-fifth,</hi> the owner of the ſoil (if not the diſcoverer) a tenth part, the Governor <hi>two-fifths,</hi> and the reſt to the public treaſury, ſaving to the king the ſhare reſerved by patent.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. In every <hi>hundred thouſand</hi> acres, the Governor and Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, by lot, reſerveth ten to himſelf, what ſhall lie but in one place.</p>
               <p n="10">X. That every man ſhall be bound to plant, or man, ſo much of his ſhare of land as ſhall be ſet out and ſurveyed, within <hi>three</hi> years after it is ſo ſet out and ſurveyed, or elſe it ſhall be lawful for new comers to be ſettled thereupon, paying to them their ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey money, and they go up higher for their ſhares.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. There ſhall be no buying and ſelling, be it with an <hi>Indian,</hi> or one among another, of any goods to be exported, but what ſhall be performed in public market, when ſuch placed ſhall be ſet apart, or erected, where they ſhall paſs the public ſtamp, or mark. If bad ware, and prized as good, or deceitful in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or weight, to forfeit the value, as if good and full weight and proportion, to the public treaſury of this province, whether it be the merchandize of the <hi>Indian,</hi> or that of the planters.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. And foraſmuch, as it is uſual with the planters to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach the poor natives of the country, in trade, by goods not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good of the kind, or debaſed with mixtures, with which they are ſenſibly aggrieved, it is agreed, whatever is ſold to the <hi>Indians,</hi> in conſideration of their furs, ſhall be ſold in the market place, and there ſuffer the teſt, whether good or bad; if good, to paſs; if not good, not to be ſold for good, that the natives may not be abuſed, nor provoked.</p>
               <p n="13">
                  <pb n="4" facs="unknown:034421_0377_0FFEA81CF8B597E8"/>XIII. That no man ſhall, by any ways or means, in word, or deed, affront, or wrong any <hi>Indian,</hi> but he ſhall incur the ſame penalty of the law, as if he had committed it againſt his fellow planter, and if any <hi>Indian</hi> ſhall abuſe, in word, or deed, any planter of this province, that he ſhall not be his own judge upon the <hi>Indian,</hi> but he ſhall make his complaint to the Governor of the province, or his Lieutenant, or Deputy, or ſome inferior Magiſtrate near him, who ſhall, to the utmoſt of his power, take care with the king of the ſaid <hi>Indian,</hi> that all reaſonable ſatisfaction be made to the ſaid injured planter.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. That all differences, between the planters and the natives, ſhall alſo be ended by <hi>twelve</hi> men, that is, by ſix planters and ſix natives; that ſo we may live friendly together as much as in us lieth, preventing all occaſions of heart-burnings and miſchief.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. That the <hi>Indians</hi> ſhall have liberty to do all things relating to improvement of their ground, and providing ſuſtenance for their families, that any of the planters ſhall enjoy.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. That the laws, as to ſlanders, drunkenneſs, ſwearing, curſing, pride in apparel, treſpaſſes, diſtreſſes, replevins, weights, and meaſures, ſhall be the ſame as in <hi>England,</hi> till altered by law in this province.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. That all ſhall mark their hogs, ſheep and other cattle, and what are not marked within <hi>three</hi> months after it is in their poſſeſſion, be it young or old, it ſhall be forfeited to the Governor, that ſo people may be compelled to avoid the occaſions of much ſtrife between planters.</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. That, in clearing the ground, care be taken to leave <hi>one</hi> acre of trees for every <hi>five</hi> acres cleared, eſpecially to preſerve oak and mulberries, for ſilk and ſhipping.</p>
               <p n="19">XIX. That all ſhip-maſters ſhall give an account of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, names, ſhips, owners, freights and paſſengers, to an officer to be appointed for that purpoſe, which ſhall be regiſtered within two days after their arrival, and if they ſhall refuſe ſo to do, that then none preſume to trade with them, upon forfeiture thereof; and that ſuch maſters be looked upon as having an evil intention to the province.</p>
               <p n="20">XX. That no perſon leave the province, without publication being made thereof, in the market place, three weeks before, and a certificate from ſome Juſtice of the Peace, of his clearneſs with his neighbours and thoſe he dealt with, ſo far as ſuch an aſſurance can be attained and given: and if any maſter of a ſhip ſhall, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary hereunto, receive and carry away any perſon, that hath not
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:034421_0378_0FFDA08D89F3FD28"/>
given that public notice, the ſaid maſter ſhall be liable to all debts owing by the ſaid perſon, ſo ſecretly tranſported from the province.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> That theſe are to be added to, or corrected, by and with the conſent of the parties hereunto ſubſcribed.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The frame of the government of the province of <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> in <hi>America:</hi> together with certain <hi>laws</hi> agreed upon in <hi>England,</hi> by the Governor and divers freemen of the aforeſaid province.

               <div type="preface">
                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>WHEN the great and wiſe <hi>God</hi> had made the world, of all his creatures, it pleaſed him to chuſe man his Deputy to rule it: and to ſit him for ſo great a charge and truſt, he did not only qualify him with ſkill and power, but with integrity to uſe them juſtly. This native goodneſs was equally his honour and his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; and whilſt he ſtood here, all went well; there was no need of coercive or compulſive means; the precept of divine love
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:034421_0379_0FFEA8A3C2DA87A0"/>
and truth, in his boſom, was the guide and keeper of his innocency. But luſt prevailing againſt duty, made a lamentable breach upon it; and the law, that before had no power over him, took place upon him, and his diſobedient poſterity, that ſuch as would not live conformable to the holy law within, ſhould fall under the reproof and correction of the juſt law without, in a judicial ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration.</p>
                  <p>This the Apoſtle teaches in divers of his epiſtles: "The law (ſays he) was added becauſe of tranſgreſſion:" In another place, "Knowing that the law was not made for the righteous man; but for the diſobedient and ungodly, for ſinners, for unholy and prophane, for murderers, for whoremongers, for them that defile themſelves with mankind, and for manſtealers, for lyers, for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured perſons," &amp;c. but this is not all, he opens and carries the matter of government a little further: "Let every ſoul be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the higher powers; for there is no power but of <hi>God.</hi> The powers that be are ordained of <hi>God:</hi> whoſoever therefore reſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the ordinance of <hi>God.</hi> For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil; wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou ſhalt have praiſe of the ſame." "He is the miniſter of God to thee for good." "Wherefore ye muſt needs be ſubject, not only for wrath, but for conſcience ſake."</p>
                  <p>This ſettles the divine right of government beyond exception, and that for two ends: firſt, to terrify evil doers; ſecondly, to cheriſh thoſe that do well; which gives government a life beyond corruption, and makes it as durable in the world, as good men ſhould be. So that government ſeems to me a part of religion it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, a thing ſacred in its inſtitution and end. For, if it does not directly remove the cauſe, it cruſhes the effects of evil, and is as ſuch, (though a lower, yet) an emanation of the ſame Divine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that is both author and object of pure religion; the difference lying here, that the one is more free and mental, the other more corporal and compulſive in its operations: but that is only to evil doers; government itſelf being otherwiſe as capable of kindneſs, goodneſs and charity, as a more private ſociety. They weakly err, that think there is no other uſe of government, than correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is the coarſeſt part of it: daily experience tells us, that the care and regulation of many other affairs, more ſoft, and daily neceſſary, make up much the greateſt part of government; and which muſt have followed the peopling of the world, had Adam never fell, and will continue among men, on earth, under the higheſt attainments they may arrive at, by the coming of the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:034421_0380_0FFDA0B5AB93F9B0"/>
bleſſed <hi>Second Adam,</hi> the <hi>Lord,</hi> from heaven. Thus much of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in general, as to its riſe and end.</p>
                  <p>For particular <hi>frames</hi> and <hi>models,</hi> it will become me to ſay little; and comparatively I will ſay nothing. My reaſons are:—</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the age is too nice and difficult for it; there being nothing the wits of men are more buſy and divided upon. It is true, they ſeem to agree to the end, to wit, happineſs; but, in the means, they differ, as to divine, ſo to this human felicity; and the cauſe is much the ſame, not always want of light and knowledge, but want of uſing them rightly. Men ſide with their paſſions againſt their reaſon, and their ſiniſter intereſts have ſo ſtrong a bias upon their minds, that they lean to them againſt the good of the things they know.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> I do not find a model in the world, that time, place, and ſome ſingular emergences have not neceſſarily altered; nor is it eaſy to frame a civil government, that ſhall ſerve all places alike.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I know what is ſaid by the ſeveral admirers of <hi>monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, ariſtocracy</hi> and <hi>democracy,</hi> which are the rule of one, a few, and many, and are the three common ideas of government, when men diſcourſe on the ſubject. But I chuſe to ſolve the controverſy with this ſmall diſtinction, and it belongs to all three: <hi>Any govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is free to the people under it</hi> (whatever be the frame) <hi>where the laws rule, and the people are a party to thoſe laws,</hi> and more than this is tyranny, oligarchy, or confuſion.</p>
                  <p>But, laſtly, when all is ſaid, there is hardly one frame of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the world ſo ill deſigned by its firſt founders, that, in good hands, would not do well enough; and ſtory tells us, the beſt, in ill ones, can do nothing that is great or good; witneſs the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> ſtates. Governments, like clocks, go from the motion men give them; and as governments are made and moved by men, ſo by them they are ruined too. Wherefore go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments rather depend upon men, than men upon governments. Let men be good, and the government cannot be bad; if it be ill, they will cure it. But, if men be bad, let the government be never ſo good, they will endeavour to warp and ſpoil it to their turn.</p>
                  <p>I know ſome ſay, let us have good laws, and no matter for the men that execute them: but let them conſider, that though good laws do well, good men do better: for good laws may want good men, and be aboliſhed or evaded by ill men; but good men will never want good laws, nor ſuffer ill ones. It is true, good laws have ſome awe upon ill miniſters, but that is where they have not power to eſcape or aboliſh them, and the people are generally wiſe and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:034421_0381_0FFEA8A7497518C8"/>
good: but a looſe and depraved people (which is to the queſtion) love laws and an adminiſtration like themſelves. That, therefore, which makes a good conſtitution, muſt keep it, <hi>viz.</hi> men of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and virtue, qualities, that becauſe they deſcend not with worldly inheritances, muſt be carefully propagated by a virtuous education of youth; for which after ages will owe more to the care and prudence of founders, and the ſucceſſive magiſtracy, than to their parents, for their private patrimonies.</p>
                  <p>Theſe conſiderations of the weight of government, and the nice and various opinions about it, made it uneaſy to me to think of publiſhing the enſuing frame and conditional laws, foreſeeing both the cenſures, they will meet with, from men of differing humours and engagements, and the occaſion they may give of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe beyond my deſign.</p>
                  <p>But, next to the power of neceſſity, (which is a ſolicitor, that will take no denial) this induced me to a compliance, that we have (with reverence to God, and good conſcience to men) to the beſt of our ſkill, contrived and compoſed the <hi>frame</hi> and <hi>laws</hi> of this government, to the great end of all government, viz. <hi>To ſupport power in reverence with the people, and to ſecure the people from the abuſe of power;</hi> that they may be free by their juſt obedience, and the magiſtrates honourable, for their juſt adminiſtration: for liberty without obedience is confuſion, and obedience without liberty is ſlavery. To carry this evenneſs is partly owing to the conſtitution, and partly to the magiſtracy: where either of theſe fail, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be ſubject to convulſions; but where both are wanting, it muſt be totally ſubverted: then where both meet, the government is like to endure. Which I humbly pray and hope <hi>God</hi> will pleaſe to make the lot of this of <hi>Penſilvania.</hi> Amen.</p>

                  <head>The anſwer of the Proprietary and Governor to the preceding addreſs of the Aſſembly, head by head.</head>
                  <p>To the firſt I ſhall appoint thoſe, in whom I can confide, whoſe powers ſhall be ſufficient and public for the ſecurity of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; and I hope they ſhall be of honeſt character, without juſt exception, to do that which is right between you and me.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Much of it is included in my anſwer to the firſt; however, I am willing to execute a public inſtrument, or charter to ſecure you in your properties, according to purchaſe, and the law of property made lately at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> excepting ſome corrections, or amendments, abſolutely neceſſary, therein.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. I know of no wilful delays, and ſhall uſe my endeavours to prevent any for the future, and am very willing to allow the ten acres per cent. for the ends propoſed by the law, and not otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. I am willing that reaſonable fees to officers ſhall be aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by law, or their ſervices left to a <hi>quantum meruit;</hi> for I hope you do not think they ſhould be maintained at my charge.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. I know of no perſon, that has been obliged to anſwer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Governor and Council, in ſuch caſes; but I conceive that diſputes about unconfined properties muſt lie before the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietary, though not before his Council, as judges.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. The records concern me, as well as the people, and are, or ſhall be, in the hands of men of good fame, and to keep them only during good behaviour; but thoſe of this county of <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia,</hi>
                     <pb n="43" facs="unknown:034421_0416_0FFDA1C6ED0AA7A8"/>
that chiefly concern the people, are in ſo great diſorder, by razures, blots and interlineations, that you would do well to uſe ſome method in time, for their rectification.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. If the <hi>Jamaica</hi> law will improve our regulation, as it doth augment the fees, I am content we copy after it.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. You are under a miſtake, in fact; I have tied you to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, in the allotment of the city, which the firſt purchaſers, then preſent, did not readily ſeem to comply with, and I am ſorry to find their names to ſuch an addreſs, as that preſented to you, who have got double lots, by my re-aplotment of the city, from fifty to one hundred and two feet front lots; and if they are willing to refund the fifty-two feet, I ſhall, as you deſire, be eaſy in the quit-rents, although this matter ſolely refers to the firſt purchaſers, and to me as Proprietary.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. You are under a miſapprehenſion, to think that a fourth part of the land, laid out for a city, belongs to any body but my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, it being reſerved for ſuch as were not firſt purchaſers, who might want to build in future time; and when I reflect upon the great abuſe, done in my abſence, by deſtroying of my timber and wood, and how the land is over-run with bruſh, to the injury and diſcredit of the town, it is ſmall encouragement to grant your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; however, I am content that ſome land be laid out for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation of the town, till inhabitants preſent to ſettle it under regulations that ſhall be thought moſt conducing to the end de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, about which, I ſhall conſult with thoſe perſons chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned therein; and for the reſt of the ninth article, about the iſlands, I know not which you mean, nor on what terms deſired, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="10">X. About the ends of ſtreets, and other public landings of this town, I am willing to grant the ends of ſtreets, when and where improved, and the other according to your requeſt.</p>
                  <p n="11">XI. I am contented that no licences be granted to any ordinary keepers, but ſuch as the Juſtices ſhall recommend, nor ſuffer them longer, than the Magiſtrates find they behave well.</p>
                  <p n="12">XII. I do not underſtand it; for I had no letters of feoffment, but deeds, which were recorded by <hi>Ephraim Harman,</hi> at <hi>Newcaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> and by <hi>John Weſt,</hi> to the beſt of my memory, at <hi>New York,</hi> and ſince confirmed by the order of Council, for the line, as well as otherwiſe, and a moſt formal poſſeſſion and obedience given me in purſuance thereof.</p>

                     <pb n="44" facs="unknown:034421_0417_0FFDA1BDB212B5D8"/>XIII. I think this an unreaſonable article, either to limit me in that which is my own, or to deprive me of the benefit of raiſing in proportion to the advantage, which time gives to other men's properties; and the rather, becauſe I am yet in diſburſe for that long and expenſive controverſy with the Lord <hi>Baltimore,</hi> promiſed to be defrayed by the public, as appears by the minutes of Council.</p>
                  <p n="14">XIV. I allow it, according to what I lately expreſſed at <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle,</hi> and it is not my fault it has not been done ſooner.</p>
                  <p n="15">XV. According to their own propoſals, at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> I ſhall gratify their deſire, <hi>viz.</hi> that the ſame revert to me, after a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time, if not improved.</p>
                  <p n="16">XVI. This I take for a high impoſition; however, I am willing that they all lye in common and free, until otherwiſe diſpoſed of, and ſhall grant the ſame from time to time, in reaſonable portions, and upon reaſonable terms, eſpecially to ſuch as ſhall engage to drain and improve the ſame; having always a regard to back in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, for their accommodations.</p>
                  <p n="17">XVII. I cannot well underſtand it; therefore it muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</p>
                  <p n="18">XVIII. It is my own inclination, and I deſire and expect the repreſentatives of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> and Cheſter forthwith, or before they leave the town, to attend me about the time and method of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
                  <p n="19">XIX. They ſhall have liberty to fiſh, fowl and hunt, upon their own lands, and upon all other lands that are mine untaken up.</p>
                  <p n="20">XX. If it ſhould be my lot to loſe a public ſupport, I muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon my rents for a ſupply; and therefore muſt not eaſily part with them; and many years are elapſed ſince I made that offer, that was not excepted.</p>
                  <p n="21">XXI. I agree that the law of property, made at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> ſhall be inſerted in the charter, with requiſite amendments.</p>

               <opener>Reſpectfully ſheweth,</opener>
               <p>THAT on conſideration of the anſwer given by the Governor to our offer of contributing towards the expence of the enſuing treaty with the <hi>Indians,</hi> we apprehend it to be neceſſary to lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him a true ſtate of the motives, which induced us to uſe our endeavours to promote a reconciliation with them; of the manner, in which we proceeded before and ſince the Governor's arrival in this province, and of ſome reaſons we have for deſiring to ſee that the grounds of their complaints are carefully and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially enquired into and conſidered, and ſuch meaſures purſued,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:034421_0429_0FFDA1EBCFB2F778"/>
for ſatisfying them as the preſent melancholy circumſtances of this province immediately require: and we doubt not, if the Governor will be pleaſed to attend to, and impartially conſider, what we ſhall offer, he will be fully convinced that our conduct hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the profeſſion, we make, of acting on thoſe principles, of fearing God, honouring the king, and promoting peace among men.</p>
               <p>We, therefore, beg leave to inform the Governor, that ſoon after the firſt accounts were brought of the miſchief done by the <hi>Indians,</hi> on the frontiers of <hi>Virginia,</hi> ſome of the people called <hi>Quakers,</hi> reſiding in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> ſeriouſly conſidering the fatal conſequences of loſing that intereſt and friendſhip our predeceſſors had obtained, by their upright dealing and hoſpitable treatment of the <hi>Indians,</hi> in the firſt ſettlement of this province; and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> general neglect of them, which had, for ſome time, been obvious, would terminate to the public diſadvantage, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to improve every future opportunity of manifeſting ſome regard to them; and ſeveral companies of <hi>Indians,</hi> of different tribes, coming to this city on divers occaſions, they were viſited by ſome of us, invited to our houſes, and on their going away, preſented with ſome ſmall matters, neceſſary for them, in their way of living; and the grateful manner in which they received theſe inſtances of regard, and the lively remembrance, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to retain, of the friendſhip, which ſubſiſted between their anceſtors, and the firſt ſettlers of this province, afforded us real ſatisfaction, and ſome grounds to hope our good intentions would not be diſappointed.</p>
               <p>During the following winter, the frequent melancholy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of the barbarous murders, committed by the <hi>Indians,</hi> on the weſtern and northern frontiers of this province, filled the minds of people in general, with a ſpirit of indignation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment againſt them, and no opportunity preſented of publicly manifeſting the earneſt concern we had, to uſe our utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, in a manner conſiſtent with our peaceable principles, to prevent the impending deſolation; the calamity became general, and every one was deeply intereſted in the meaſures taken for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring into the cauſes, which induced our ancient ſteady friends to become our enemies: yet this being the proper buſineſs of thoſe then concerned in the adminiſtration of the government, we waited the event of their proceedings, having juſt grounds to hope, that the knowledge ſome of them had of ſeveral matters, which might probably have contributed to this unhappy rupture,<note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe were printed both in the gazettes and in their minutes.</note>
                  <pb n="57" facs="unknown:034421_0430_0FFDA20591201820"/>
together with the repeated applications of the Aſſembly of the province, would have excited them to purſue every rational me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of making ſuch an enquiry, and obtaining an amicable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtment of all differences with theſe <hi>Indians,</hi> and of thereby averting the melancholy conſequences of continuing to expoſe them immediately to the artifices of the <hi>French,</hi> who would not fail to take advantage of our miſunderſtanding with them: but the ſpring of another year returned, and the public remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with ſuch meaſures being purſued; great military preparations were indeed made and ſorts erected in many parts of the frontiers, but the deſolation and diſtreſs of the province in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and the ſanguine expectations of the people, who had, at firſt, hoped by theſe means to defend themſelves, were remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably diſappointed. Governor <hi>Morris,</hi> nevertheleſs, determining to iſſue a declaration of war againſt the <hi>Delawares</hi> and <hi>Shawaneſe,</hi> many of the people called <hi>Quakers</hi> reſiding in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> met together and preſented an addreſs to him, earneſtly beſeeching, "That every meaſure which had been purſued, and whatever remained poſſible to be done, to prevent ſo lamentable an extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, might be ſtrictly and impartially reviewed and conſidered; that full enquiry might be made, whether ſome apprehenſions theſe <hi>Indians</hi> had conceived of a deviation from the integrity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct towards them, conſpicuous in the firſt eſtabliſhment, might not unhappily have contributed, in ſome degree, to the alteration of their conduct towards us; that full time might be allowed for theſe <hi>Indians,</hi> who remained well affected towards us, to uſe and report the effect of their endeavours to reconcile our enemies to us, and that, by the Governor's care, to guard againſt involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the innocent with the guilty, ſuch clear demonſtrations of Chriſtian tenderneſs might be given, as might tend to the engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other neighbouring <hi>Indians</hi> in the deſirable work of reſtoring peace and tranquillity; and, at the ſame time, offering, though a much larger part of their eſtates ſhould be neceſſary, than the heavieſt taxes of a war could be expected to require, by voluntary grants chearfully to contribute towards the obtaining peace, in the ſame manner as the unhappy experience of ſeveral of the moſt martial neighbouring colonies had, after long and bloody wars, teſtified it muſt at laſt, if ever, be obtained."</p>
               <p>Governor <hi>Morris</hi> was pleaſed to give a civil anſwer to this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs; but thought it neceſſary to proceed immediately to a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of war: a few days after which, ſome of us having the opportunity of a free conference with <hi>Conrad Weiſer,</hi> who had, as provincial interpreter, been long concerned in public tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with the <hi>Indians;</hi> we were thereby confirmed in our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions,
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:034421_0431_0FFDA1AFB6AF3CB0"/>
that ſome diſſatisfaction, reſpecting their lands, had tended to the alienating their friendſhip from us; and that he thought the only method, to ſave the province from ruin, was to endeavour for a peace with them, by <hi>pacific meaſures;</hi> and the next day a <hi>Delaware Indian,</hi> from the <hi>Jerſeys,</hi> was ſent to one of us, with a letter from <hi>Conrad Weiſer,</hi> recommending him, as a perſon worthy of ſome notice from us, and fit to be employed on a meſſage to the <hi>Delawares,</hi> when an opportunity of ſending one could be obtained; and there being, at that time, a number of the <hi>Chiefs</hi> of the <hi>Six Nation Indians</hi> in town, ſome of us thought it neceſſary to take ſome friendly notice of them; but being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to avoid giving any occaſion of offence, before we had any converſation with them, two of us waited on Governor <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> and informed him, "That as he had iſſued his declaration of war, we thought it our duty to acquieſce therein; but, as there were ſome <hi>friendly Indians</hi> in town, we were diſpoſed to take ſome notice of them, and to endeavour, by a friendly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, to manifeſt our good diſpoſition towards them, and engage their good offices on any occaſion, which might be improved for the public welfare; and we, at the ſame time, aſſured the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor if any thing ſhould occur, which had a proſpect of tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the public intereſt, or might be worthy of his notice, he ſhould be fully acquainted therewith." The Governor expreſſed his approbation of our deſign, and gave us full liberty to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute our intentions, and the next day ſome of theſe <hi>Indian Chiefs,</hi> with <hi>Conrad Weiſer</hi> and <hi>Andrew Montour,</hi> the provincial interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and <hi>D. Claus,</hi> General <hi>Johnſon</hi>'s Secretary, dined at one of our houſes; and after dinner, had ſome converſation on the happy ſtate of the firſt ſettlers of this province, and the unhappy rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which had lately happened.</p>
               <p>The free and hearty acknowledgments of pleaſure and gratitude, from theſe <hi>Indians,</hi> fully evidenced their good diſpoſition towards us, and induced <hi>Conrad Weiſer</hi> to declare, he had not lately heard them expreſs themſelves with ſo much openneſs, and earneſtly to urge our improving this opportunity; and, in order to it, he adviſed the calling together as many of our ancient men, of the ſurvivors of the firſt ſettlers, as we could collect, and to give the <hi>Indians</hi> another meeting, in which the ſubſtance of that converſation might be repeated, and enforced on their minds, by preſenting them with a belt of <hi>wampum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Governor <hi>Morris</hi> was immediately informed of what had paſſed; and as there appeared ſome proſpect of improving this diſpoſition of the <hi>Indians</hi> to the public benefit, he was aſſured, that if he would adviſe and direct the manner of proceeding, nothing more
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:034421_0432_0FFDA13FE72126A0"/>
was deſired by us than under his direction to proceed therein, in ſuch manner as would be moſt agreeable to him, moſt effectually anſwer the purpoſe intended, and demonſtrate that we did not act from views of private advantage thereby: and leſt the differences then ſubſiſting, between him and the Aſſembly, about the raiſing money for the public ſervices, ſhould diſcourage, or retard his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging therein; he was told, that whatever ſum of money ſhould be wanting, even, to the amount of £. 5,000, he ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſupplied with, and by every part of our conduct, ſhould find our hearty concern for the public welfare to be our principal motive.</p>
               <p>Our purpoſes appeared acceptable to the Governor; about twenty of us, with the ſame interpreters, had two conferences with the <hi>Indians;</hi> and the moſt material parts of what they ſaid were immediately communicated to the Governor; and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal<note n="*" place="bottom">This was made by the <hi>Indians Chiefs,</hi> and the meſſage to be from them to the <hi>Delawares,</hi> &amp;c.</note> of ſending three meſſengers to the <hi>Delawares</hi> and <hi>Shawa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe</hi> being approved of by him, the neceſſary proviſion was made for their ſetting out, and proper company provided, for their ſafe conduct through the improved part of the province; and when they were ready to proceed on their journey, the Governor being waited on for the paſſes, and requeſted to direct what ſignal they ſhould give, on their return, to diſtinguiſh them from enemies; while the paſſes lay before him ready to be ſigned, he ſuddenly appeared to change his intentions, and ſignified his reſolution to conſult his Council, on the occaſion. The minutes of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with theſe <hi>Indians,</hi> being examined and ſigned by the three interpreters, were immediately, after this, delivered to the Governor; and, his Council being ſummoned, we were informed, they ſoon agreed, that, as he had ſo lately declared war, any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of peace from him would be unſeaſonable, and that the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod firſt propoſed of the meſſengers going with ſuch inſtructions, as they had received from their own <hi>chiefs,</hi> was moſt fit to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued. The next day the <hi>Indian chiefs</hi> ſetting out in the ſtage boat for <hi>New York,</hi> after they were gone, the meſſengers refuſed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the ſervice they had undertaken, and the day following, the Governor, in conſequence of ſome intelligence received from the Governor of <hi>New York,</hi> concluded to ſend the meſſengers in his own name.</p>

we had hitherto depended, copies of the minutes of our converſations with the <hi>Indians,</hi> and their anſwers, were immediately ſent to the Governor of <hi>New York,</hi> and to General <hi>Johnſon,</hi> and an earneſt application for their aſſiſtance, in engaging the <hi>Indians</hi> of the <hi>Six Nations</hi> to promote the reſtoration of peace, with an offer of chearfully defraying the expences thereof, Governor <hi>Hardy</hi> was ſo kind as to ſend ſuch an anſwer as evidenced his hearty concern for the public welfare; and laid us under ſenſible obligations; and we never received the leaſt hint, from General <hi>Johnſon,</hi> of his diſapprobation of any part of our conduct therein. Under theſe circumſtances, we had reaſon to apprehend that our intention was approved of, and the ſpeedy return of the meſſengers with an agreeable anſwer, confirmed us in a reſolution to continue our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to engage as many of our fellow-ſubjects, as poſſible, to concur with us therein.</p>
               <p>The meſſengers being ſent the ſecond time, on their return brought with them the <hi>Indian king, Teedyuſcung,</hi> and ſome of his people, to <hi>Eaſton,</hi> and repeatedly informed us of the neceſſity of our perſonal attendance there, and manifeſt thereby, and by contributing towards the expences of a ſuitable preſent, the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of our profeſſions of regard to them; and they were not willing to go back to the <hi>Indians,</hi> without us.</p>
               <p>We, therefore, being informed that Governor Morris had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to meet them at <hi>Eaſton,</hi>

                  <pb n="63" facs="unknown:034421_0436_0FFDA1F290C11BB8"/>At the ſecond treaty, at <hi>Eaſton,</hi> the Governor, by his candid and ingenuous treatment of the <hi>Indians</hi> (as the <hi>Mohawks</hi> ſince aptly expreſſed it) "Put his hand into <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi>'s boſom, and was to ſucceſsful as to draw out the ſecret; which neither Sir William Johnſon, nor the <hi>Six Nations</hi> could do." From that time it was generally known, that one cauſe of the alienation of their friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was ſome injuſtice they had received, or ſuppoſed to be done them, in the purchaſes and running out of their lands. They complained of divers kinds of frauds, which had been committed, repeatedly urged, that an impartial enquiry ſhould be made into the grounds of their complaints, by ſearching all our records, and by the ſtrong motives of a regard to our temporal and eternal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, urged the Governor to give liberty to all perſons and friends to ſearch into thoſe matters. Thus we thought ourſelves under the ſtrongeſt obligations to make all the enquiry in our power, into the true ſtate of the <hi>Indian</hi> claims, whether or not ſuch care had been taken to purchaſe, and pay them for the lands, as the Proprietaries' Agents had conſtantly aſſerted. The right many of us who hold large tracts of land under the firſt ſettlers, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor's repeated declarations, both in public and private, that thoſe matters ſhould be honeſtly and fully enquired into, and the <hi>Indians'</hi> injunctions that this ſhould be done, not only by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons thus complained of, or their Agents, but by others likewiſe intereſted therein, united in engaging our particular attention, and gave us a reaſonable proſpect of meeting with the Governor's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation; and though the Secretary refuſed to permit us to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed therein, by inſpecting the records in his office, we ſtill had cauſe to think our farther application to the neceſſary and import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant concern of regaining peace, was not contrary to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or's inclination, as on our informing him of our intention to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the treaty at <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and our willingneſs to contribute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the expenſes of the preſent, to be given to the <hi>Indians</hi> there, the Governor with the utmoſt readineſs expreſſed his approbation of our propoſal; and we are not conſcious of having, at that treaty, or ſince, given the leaſt occaſion for the alteration of his conduct towards us; which from the anſwer now received, and the converſion conſequent thereon, we have occaſion to obſerve.</p>
               <p>We have no views inconſiſtent with the honour of our gracious king, and the intereſt of our country, both which we ſincerely endeavour to promote; we have heartily deſired that people of every denomination, in the province, would unite in the ſame good purpoſe, and particularly in this buſineſs, that the ſame har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and good underſtanding, which ſubſiſted between the firſt ſettlers of the province and the natives, might be revived and
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:034421_0437_0FFDA2240DFF9E40"/>
maintained, and we have happily ſucceeded with ſeveral religious ſocieties, who have raiſed funds, and are ready to apply them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards reſtoring peace: and, if the complaints of the <hi>Indians</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be juſt, and the Proprietaries and their Agents ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to make them ſuch ſatisfaction as, in juſtice, they ought to have, rather than the lives of our fellow-ſubjects ſhould be ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed, their properties deſtroyed, and ſo large a part of the king's dominions laid waſte, they will freely join with us, in contributing towards the ſatisfying ſuch juſt claims of the <hi>Indians,</hi> or at leaſt, to pacify them, till the immediate authority of the king, of whoſe juſtice and paternal care we have not the leaſt doubt, can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed, and juſtice, equity and mercy be again reſtored and maintained amongſt us.</p>
               <p>And, if we are now ſo happy as to convince the Governor of the integrity of our intentions and conduct, we ſhall have reaſon to hope, he will concur with us, in taking the firſt opportunity of convincing the nobleman he has named, that it muſt be from ſome unjuſt repreſentations, that he was induced to think, "We had preſumed to treat with foreign princes, or by acting as medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators, between the government and an independent people, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded the king's prerogative royal." We apprehend, our duty to God and the king has engaged us in this buſineſs; and ſome of the good effects thereof have already appeared; we, therefore, now again offer the Governor, to contribute ſomething conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble towards the preſent neceſſary to be made to the <hi>Indians,</hi> at the enſuing treaty, and by our perſonal attendance to improve the confidence and good opinion theſe people have of us, to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic benefit.</p>
               <p>Should the Governor perſiſt in refuſing to accept our preſent, we aſſure him, we ſhall not, by any part of our conduct, give any juſt occaſion to charge us with a diſreſpectful conduct towards him, and we deſire our attendance, at the treaty, may not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as ſuch. The buſineſs to be tranſacted there is of ſo much conſequence to the lives, liberties, and properties of the people of this province, that ſhould we omit to attend there, and depend on the Governor and the King's Agent, receiving all their infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, on this important occaſion, from the Proprietaries' Agents and others, who have, for ſome years paſt, been concerned in the tranſacting <hi>Indian</hi> affairs, we ſhould be deficient of our duty, as <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> denominations, we hold more dear to us, than any other titles, or appellations, whatſoever.</p>

I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that, if I died in the undertaking, it would be as much for the <hi>Indians</hi> as the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and that I hoped my journey would be of this advantage, that it would be the means of ſaving the lives of many hundreds of the <hi>Indians:</hi> therefore, I was reſolved to go forward, taking my life in my hand, as one ready to part with it for their good. Immediately after I had ſpoken thus, three roſe up and offered to go with me the neareſt way; and we concluded to go through the inhabitants, under the Blue mountains to ſort <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſta,</hi> on <hi>Suſquahanna;</hi> where we arrived the 25th.</p>
                  <p>It gave me great pain to obſerve many plantations deſerted and laid waſte; and I could not but reflect on the diſtreſs, the poor

                  <p>At fort <hi>Auguſta</hi> we were entertained very kindly, had our horſes ſhod, and one being lame, we exchanged for another. Here we received, by <hi>Indians</hi> from <hi>Diahogo,</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">An Indian ſettlement towards the heads of Suſquahanna.</note> the diſagreeable news that our army was, as they ſaid, entirely cut off at <hi>Ticonderoga,</hi> which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged one of my companions, <hi>Lappopetung</hi>'s ſon, ſo much, that he would proceed no further. <hi>Shamokin Daniel</hi> here aſked me, if I thought he ſhould be ſatisfied for his trouble in going with me. I told him every body, that did any ſervice for the province, I thought, would be paid.</p>
                  <p>—27th. They furniſhed us here with every neceſſary for our journey, and we ſet out with good courage. After we rode about ten miles, we were caught in a hard guſt of rain.</p>
                  <p>—28th. We came to <hi>Wekeeponall,</hi> where the road turns off for <hi>Wyoming,</hi> and ſlept this night at <hi>Queenaſhawakee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>—29th. We croſſed the <hi>Suſquahanna</hi> over the <hi>Big Iſland.</hi> My companions were now very fearful, and this night went a great way out of the road, to ſleep without fire, but could not ſleep for the muſquetoes and vermin.</p>
                  <p>—30th &amp; 31ſt. We were glad it was day, that we might ſet out. We got upon the mountains, and had heavy rains all night. The heavens alone were our covering, and we accepted of all that was poured down from thence.</p>

                  <p>—2d. We came acroſs ſeveral places where two poles, painted red, were ſtuck in the ground by the <hi>Indians,</hi> to which they tye the priſoners, when they ſtop at night, in their return from their incurſions. We arrived this night at <hi>Shinglimuhee,</hi> where was another of the ſame poſts. It is a diſagreeable and melancholy fight, to ſee the means they make uſe of, according to their ſavage way, to diſtreſs others.</p>
                  <p>—3d. We came to a part of a river called <hi>Tobeco,</hi> over the mountains, a very bad road.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="68" facs="unknown:034421_0441_0FFDA1596DA22CB8"/>
                     <hi>Auguſt</hi> 4th. We loſt one of our horſes, and with much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty found him, but were detained a whole day on that account.</p>
                  <p>I had much converſation with <hi>Piſquetumen;</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">An <hi>Indian</hi> Chief, that travelled with him.</note> of which I think to inform myſelf further when I get to my journey's end.</p>
                  <p>—5th. We ſet out early this day, and made a good long ſtretch, croſſing the big river <hi>Tobeco,</hi> and lodged between two mountains. I had the misfortune to loſe my pocket book with three pounds five ſhillings,<note n="†" place="bottom">The money of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> being paper, is chiefly carried in pocket books.</note> and ſundry other things. What writings it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained were illegible to any body but myſelf.</p>
                  <p>—6th. We paſſed all the mountains, and the big river, <hi>Weſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waucks,</hi> and croſſed a fine meadow two miles in length, where we ſlept that night, having nothing to eat.</p>
                  <p>—7th. We came in ſight of fort <hi>Venango,</hi> belonging to the <hi>French,</hi> ſituate between two mountains, in a fork of the <hi>Ohio</hi> river. I prayed the Lord to blind them, as he did the enemies of <hi>Lot</hi> and <hi>Eliſha,</hi> that I might paſs unknown. When we arrived, the fort being on the other ſide of the river, we hallooed, and deſired them to fetch us over; which they were afraid to do; but ſhewed us a place where we might ford. We ſlept that night within half gun ſhot of the fort.</p>
                  <p>—8th. This morning I hunted for my horſe, round the fort, within ten yards of it. The Lord heard my prayer, and I paſſed unknown till we had mounted our horſes to go off, when two <hi>Frenchmen</hi> came to take leave of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and were much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed at ſeeing me, but ſaid nothing.</p>
                  <p>By what I could learn of <hi>Piſquetumen,</hi> and the <hi>Indians,</hi> who went into the fort, the garriſon conſiſted of only ſix men, and an officer blind of one eye. They enquired much of the <hi>Indians</hi> concerning the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whether they knew of any party coming to attack them, of which they were very apprehenſive.</p>
                  <p>—9th. Heavy rains all night and day: we ſlept on ſwampy ground.</p>
                  <p>—10th. We imagined we were near <hi>Kuſhkuſhkee;</hi> and having travelled three miles, we met three <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> who appeared ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhy of us, but ſaid nothing more than to enquire, whether we knew of any <hi>Engliſh</hi> coming againſt fort <hi>Venango.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After we travelled two miles farther, we met with an <hi>Indian,</hi> and one that I took to be a runagade <hi>Engliſh Indian</hi> trader; he ſpoke good <hi>Engliſh,</hi> was very curious in examining every thing,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:034421_0442_0FFDA15B1B289360"/>
particularly the ſilver medal about Piſquitumen's neck. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by his countenance to be guilty. We enquired of them where we were, and found we were loſt, and within twenty miles of fort <hi>Duqueſne.</hi> We ſtruck out of the road to the right, and ſlept between two mountains; and being deſtitute of food, two went to hunt, and the others to ſeek a road, but to no purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>—11th. We went to the place were they had killed two deers, and <hi>Piſquetumen</hi> and I roaſted the meat. Two went to hunt for the road, to know which way we ſhould go: one came back, and had found a road; the other loſt himſelf.</p>
                  <p>—12th. The reſt of us hunted for him, but in vain; ſo, as we could not find him, we concluded to ſet off, leaving ſuch marks, that, if he returned, he might know which way to follow us; and we left him ſome meat. We came to the river <hi>Conaquonaſhon,</hi> where was an old <hi>Indian</hi> town. We were then fifteen miles from <hi>Kuſhkuſhkee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There we ſtopt, and ſent forward <hi>Piſquetumen</hi> with four ſtrings of <hi>wampum</hi> to apprize the town of our coming,<note n="*" place="bottom">According to the rules of <hi>Indian politeneſs,</hi> you muſt never go into a town with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſending a previous meſſage to denote your arrival, or, ſtanding at a diſtance from the town, and hallooing till ſome come out, to conduct you in.

                  <p>About noon we met ſome <hi>Shawaneſe,</hi> that uſed to live at <hi>Wyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</hi> They knew me, and received me very kindly. I ſaluted them, and aſſured them the government of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> wiſhed them well, and wiſhed to live in peace and friendſhip with them. Before we came to the town, two men came to meet us and lead

us in. King Beaver ſhewed us a large houſe to lodge in.<note n="*" place="bottom">Every <hi>Indian</hi> town has a large cabbin for the entertainment of ſtrangers by the public hoſpitality.</note> The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſoon came and ſhook hands with us. The number was about ſixty young able men. Soon after king <hi>Beaver</hi> came and told his people, "Boys, hearken, we ſat here without ever expecting again to ſee our brethren the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> but now one of them is brought before you, that you may ſee your brethren, the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> with your own eyes; and I wiſh you may take it into conſideration." Afterwards he turned to me and ſaid,</p>
                  <p>"Brother, I am very glad to ſee you, I never thought we ſhould have had the opportunity to ſee one another more; but now I am very glad, and thank God, who has brought you to us. It is a great ſatisfaction to me." I ſaid, "Brother, I rejoice in my heart, I thank God, who has brought me to you. I bring you joyful news from the Governor and people of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> and from your children, the <hi>Friends:</hi>

                  <p>In the evening king Beaver came again, and told me, they had held a council, and ſent out to all their towns, but it would take five days before they could all come together. I thanked him for his care. Ten captains came and ſaluted me. One ſaid to the others; "We never expected to ſee our brethren the <hi>Engliſh</hi> again, but now God has granted us once more to ſhake hands with them, which we will not forget." They ſat by my fire till midnight.</p>
                  <p>—14th. The people crowded to my houſe; it was full. We had much talk. <hi>Delaware George</hi> ſaid, he had not ſlept all night, ſo much had he been engaged on account of my coming. The <hi>French</hi> came, and would ſpeak with me. There were then fifteen of them building houſes for the <hi>Indians.</hi> The captain is gone with fifteen to another town. He can ſpeak the <hi>Indian</hi> tongue well. The <hi>Indians</hi> ſay he is a cunning fox; that they get a great deal of goods from the <hi>French;</hi> and that the French cloath the <hi>Indians</hi> every year, men, women and children, and give them as much powder and lead as they want.</p>
                  <p>—15th. <hi>Beaver</hi> king was informed, that <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> had ſaid he had turned the hatchet againſt the <hi>French,</hi> by advice of the <hi>Allegany Indians;</hi> this he blamed, as they had never ſent him ſuch advice. But being informed it was his own doing, without any perſuaſion of the Governor, he was eaſy on that head. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laware

Daniel</hi> prepared a dinner, to which he invited me, and all the kings and captains; and when I came, he ſaid, "Brother, we are as glad to ſee you among us, as if we dined with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor and people in <hi>Philadelphia.</hi> We have thought a great deal ſince you have been here. We never thought ſo much before."<note n="*" place="bottom">That is, we look on your coming as a matter of importance, it engages our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</note> I thanked them for their kind reception; I ſaid, it was ſomething great, that God had ſpared our lives, to ſee one another again, in the old brother-like love and friendſhip. There were in all thirteen, who dined together.</p>
                  <p>In the evening they danced at my fire, firſt the men, and then the women, till after midnight.</p>
                  <p>On the 16th, the king and the captains called on me privately. They wanted to hear what <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> had ſaid of them, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me to take out the writings. I read to them what <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> had ſaid, and told them, as <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> had ſaid he would ſpeak ſo loud, that all at <hi>Allegheny,</hi> and beyond, ſhould hear it, I would conceal nothing from them. They ſaid, they never ſent any ſuch advice (as above mentioned) to <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> nor ever ſent a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage at all to the government; and now the <hi>French</hi> were here, their captain would come to hear, and this would make diſturbance. I then told them I would read the reſt, and leave out that part, and they might tell the kings and captains of it, when they came together.</p>
                  <p>— 17th. Early this morning they called all the people toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to clean the place, where they intended to hold the council, it being in the middle of the town. <hi>Kuſhkuſhkee</hi> is divided into four towns, each at a diſtance from the others; and the whole conſiſts of about ninety houſes, and two hundred able warriors.</p>
                  <p>About noon two public meſſengers arrived from the <hi>Indians</hi> at fort <hi>Duqueſne</hi> and the other towns. They brought three large belts and two bundles of ſtrings;<note n="†" place="bottom">Theſe belts and ſtrings are made of ſhell-beads, called <hi>wampum.</hi> The <hi>wampum</hi> ſerves, among the <hi>Indians,</hi> as money; of it they alſo make their necklaces, bracelets, and other ornaments.

ſurly. When I went to ſhake hands with one of them, he gave me his little finger; the other withdrew his hand entirely; upon which I appeared as ſtout as either, and withdrew my hand as quick as I could. Their rudeneſs to me was taken very ill by the other cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, who treated them in the ſame manner in their turn.</p>
                  <p>I told them my order was to go to the <hi>Indian</hi> towns, kings and captains, and not to the <hi>French;</hi> that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were at was with the French, but not with thoſe <hi>Indians,</hi> who withdrew from the <hi>French,</hi> and would be at peace with the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>King Beaver invited me to his houſe to dinner, and afterwards he invited the <hi>French</hi> captain, and ſaid before the <hi>Frenchman,</hi> that the <hi>Indians</hi> were very proud to ſee one of their brothers, the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,</hi> among them; at which the <hi>French</hi> captain appeared low ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited, and ſeemed to eat his dinner with very little appetite.</p>

                  <p>King <hi>Beaver, Shingas,</hi> and <hi>Delaware George,</hi> ſpoke as follows:</p>
                  <p>"Brother, we alone cannot make a peace; it would be of no ſignification; for, as all the <hi>Indians,</hi> from the ſun-riſe to the ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, are united in a body, it is neceſſary that the whole ſhould join in the peace, or it can be no peace; and we can aſſure you, all the <hi>Indians,</hi> a great way from this, even beyond the lakes, are deſirous of, and wiſh for a peace with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and have deſired <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>On the 19th, all the people gathered together, men, women, and children; and king <hi>Beaver</hi> deſired me to read to them the news I had brought, and told me that all the able men would go with me to the other town. I complied with his deſire, and they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared very much pleaſed at every thing, till I came to that part reſpecting the priſoners. This they diſliked; for, they ſay, it appears very odd and unreaſonable that we ſhould demand priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers before there is an eſtabliſhed peace; ſuch an unreaſonable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand makes us appear as if we wanted brains.</p>
                  <p>—20th. We ſet out from <hi>Kuſhkuſhkee,</hi> for <hi>Sankonk;</hi> my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany conſiſted of twenty-five horſemen and fifteen foot. We ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at <hi>Sankonk,</hi> in the afternoon. The people of the town were much diſturbed at my coming, and received me in a very rough manner. They ſurrounded me with drawn knives in their hands, in ſuch a manner, that I could hardly get along; running up againſt me; with their breaſts open, as if they wanted ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to kill me. I ſaw by their countenances they ſought my death. Their faces were quite diſtorted with rage, and they went ſo far as to ſay, I ſhould not live long; but ſome <hi>Indians,</hi> with whom I was formerly acquainted, coming up, and ſaluting me in a friendly manner, their behaviour to me was quickly changed.</p>

                  <p>"Brother, we, the <hi>Shawaneſe</hi> and <hi>Mingos,</hi> have heard your meſſage; the meſſenger we ſent to Fort <hi>Duqueſne,</hi> is returned, and tells us, there are eight different nations there, who want to hear your meſſage; we will conduct you there, and let both the <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>French</hi> hear what our brothers, the Engliſh, have to ſay."</p>
                  <p>I proteſted againſt going to Fort <hi>Duqueſne,</hi> but all in vain; for they inſiſted on my going, and ſaid that I need not fear the <hi>French,</hi> for they would carry me in their boſoms, i. e. engage for my ſafety.</p>
                  <p>—23d. We ſet off for Fort <hi>Duqueſne,</hi> and went no farther this night than Log's town, where I met with four <hi>Shawaneſe,</hi> who lived in <hi>Wyoming</hi> when I did. They received me very kindly, and called the priſoners to ſhake hands with me, as their country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and gave me leave to go into every houſe to ſee them, which was done in no other town beſides.</p>
                  <p>—24th. They called to me, and deſired that I would write to the general for them. The jealouſy natural to the <hi>Indians</hi> is not to be deſcribed; for though they wanted me to write for them, they were afraid I would, at the ſame time, give other information, and this perplexed them.</p>
                  <p>We continued our journey to the fort; and arrived in ſight, on this ſide the river, in the afternoon, and all the <hi>Indian</hi> chiefs immediately came over; they called me into the middle, and king <hi>Beaver</hi> preſented me to them, and ſaid, "Here is our <hi>Engliſh</hi> brother, who has brought great news." Two of them roſe up and ſignified they were glad to ſee me. But an old deaf <hi>Onondago Indian</hi> roſe up and ſignified his diſpleaſure.

                  <p>After this the <hi>French</hi> demanded me of the <hi>Indians.</hi> They ſaid it was a cuſtom among the white people when a meſſenger came, even if it was the Governor, to blind his eyes, and lead him into the fort, to a priſon, or private room. They, with ſome of the <hi>Indians</hi> inſiſted very much on my being ſent into the fort, but to no purpoſe; for the other <hi>Indians</hi> ſaid to the <hi>French:</hi> "It may be a rule among you, but we have brought him here, that all the <hi>Indians</hi> might ſee him, and hear what our brothers the Engliſh have to ſay; and we will not ſuffer him to be blinded and carried into the fort."

Then he addreſſed himſelf to the <hi>Shawaneſe,</hi> and ſaid, "You brought the hatchet to us from the <hi>French,</hi> and perſuaded us to ſtrike our brothers the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> you may conſider (laying the belts, &amp;c. before them) wherefore you have done this."</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Shawaneſe</hi> acknowledged they received the hatchet from the <hi>French,</hi> who perſuaded them to ſtrike the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> that they would now ſend the belts to all the <hi>Indians,</hi> and in twelve days would meet again.</p>
                  <p>Preſent at this council, three hundred <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians.</hi> They all took leave, and went over again to the fort, but my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, who were about ſeventy in number.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Shamokin Daniel,</hi> who came with me, went over to the fort by himſelf, (which my companions diſapproved of) and counſelled with the Governor; who preſented him with a laced coat and hat, a blanket, ſhirts, ribbons, a new gun, powder, lead, &amp;c. When he returned he was quite changed, and ſaid, "See here, you
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:034421_0453_0FFDA168AAE15F08"/>
fools, what the <hi>French</hi> have given me. I was in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and never received a farthing;" and, directing himſelf to me, he ſaid, "The Engliſh are fools, and ſo are you." In ſhort, he behaved in a very proud, ſaucy and imperious manner. He further ſaid, "The <hi>Engliſh</hi> never give the <hi>Indians</hi> any powder, and that the <hi>French</hi> would have given him a horſeload, if he would have taken it; ſee that young man there, he was in <hi>Philadelphia</hi> and never got on thing; I will take him over to the <hi>French,</hi> and get ſome cloathing for him."</p>
                  <p>Three <hi>Indians</hi> informed me, that as ſoon as the <hi>French</hi> got over, they called a council, with their own <hi>Indians,</hi> among whom there happened accidentally to be a <hi>Delaware</hi> captain, who was privately invited by one of his acquaintance to hear what the French had to ſay; and when they were aſſembled, the <hi>French</hi> ſpoke, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:</p>
                  <p>"My children, now we are alone, hearken to what I have to ſay. I perceive the <hi>Delawares</hi> are wavering; they incline to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and will be faithful to us no longer. Now all their chiefs are here, and but a handful, let us cut them off, and then we ſhall be troubled with them no longer." Then the <hi>Tawaas</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, "No, we cannot do this thing; for though there is but a handful here, the <hi>Delawares</hi> are a ſtrong people, and are ſpread to a great diſtance, and whatever they agree to muſt be."</p>
                  <p>This afternoon, in council, on the other ſide of the river, the <hi>French</hi> inſiſted that I muſt be delivered up to them, and that it was not lawful for me to go away; which occaſioned a quarrel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the <hi>Indians,</hi> who immediately came away and croſſed the river to me; and ſome of them let me know that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> had received a ſtring from the <hi>French,</hi> to leave me there; but it was to no purpoſe, for they would not give their conſent; and then agreed that I ſhould ſet off before day the next morning.</p>
                  <p>—27th. Accordingly I ſet out before day, with ſix <hi>Indians,</hi> and took another road, that we might not be ſeen; the main body told me, they would ſtay behind, to know whether the <hi>French</hi> would make an attempt to take me by force; that if they did, they, the <hi>Indians,</hi> would endeavour to prevent their croſſing the river, and coming ſecretly upon me. Juſt as I ſet off the <hi>French</hi> fired all their great guns, it being Sunday (I counted nineteen) and concluded they did the ſame every Sabbath. We paſſed through three <hi>Shawaneſe</hi> towns; the <hi>Indians</hi> appeared very proud to ſee me return, and we arrived about night at <hi>Sawcunk,</hi> where they were likewiſe very glad to ſee me return. Here I met with the two captains, who treated me ſo uncivilly before; they now

received me very kindly, and accepted of my hand, and apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gized for their former rude behaviour. Their names are <hi>Kuckque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

The ſaid <hi>Killbuck</hi> is a great captain and conjurer; he deſired me to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion him to the Governor, and aſk him if he would be pleaſed to ſend him a good ſaddle by the next meſſenger; and that he would do all in his power for the ſervice of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>—28th. We ſet out from <hi>Sawcunk,</hi> in company with twenty, for <hi>Kuſhkuſhkee;</hi> on the road <hi>Shingas</hi> addreſſed himſelf to me, and aſked, if I did not think, that, if he came to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they would hang him, as they had offered a great reward for his head. He ſpoke in a very ſoft and eaſy manner. I told him that was a great while ago, it was all forgotten and wiped clean away; that the Engliſh would receive him very kindly. Then <hi>Daniel</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted me, and ſaid to <hi>Shingas,</hi> "Do not believe him, he tells nothing but idle lying ſtories.

Then <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaid, "D—n you, why do not you and the <hi>French</hi> ſight on the ſea? You come here only to cheat the poor <hi>Indians,</hi> and take their land from them." Then <hi>Shingas</hi> told him to be ſtill; for he did not know what he ſaid. We arrived at <hi>Kuſhkuſhkee</hi> before night, and I informed <hi>Piſquetumen</hi> of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s behaviour, at which he appeared ſorry.</p>
                  <p>—29th. I dined with <hi>Shingas;</hi> he told me, though the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> had ſet a great price on his head, he had never thought to revenge himſelf, but was always very kind to any priſoners that were brought in; and that he aſſured the Governor, he would do all in his power to bring about an eſtabliſhed peace, and wiſhed he could be certain of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> being in earneſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="82" facs="unknown:034421_0455_0FFDA1A6FAF27440"/>Then ſeven chiefs preſent ſaid, when the Governor ſends the next meſſenger, let him ſend two or three white men, at leaſt, to confirm the thing, and not ſend ſuch a man as <hi>Daniel;</hi> they did not underſtand him; he always ſpeaks, ſaid they, as if he was drunk; and if a great many of them had not known me, they ſhould not know what to think; for every thing I ſaid he contradicted. I aſſured them I would faithfully inform the Governor of what they ſaid, and they ſhould ſee, as meſſengers, other guiſe <hi>Indians</hi> than <hi>Daniel,</hi> for the time to come; and I farther informed them, that he was not ſent by the Governor, but came on his own accord; and I would endeavour to prevent his coming again. <hi>Daniel</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of me his pay, and I gave him three dollars; and he took as much wampum from me as he pleaſed, and would not ſuffer me to count it.

                  <p>—30th and 31ſt. The <hi>Indians</hi> feaſted greatly, during which time, I ſeveral times begged of them to conſider and diſpatch me.</p>
                  <p>September 1ſt. <hi>Shingas,</hi> King <hi>Beaver, Delaware George,</hi> and <hi>Piſquetumen,</hi> with ſeveral other captains ſaid to me,</p>
                  <p>"Brother, We have thought a great deal ſince God has brought you to us; and this is a matter of great conſequence, which we cannot readily anſwer; we think on it, and will anſwer you as ſoon as we can. Our feaſt hinders us; all our young men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children are glad to ſee you; before you came, they all agreed together to go and join the <hi>French;</hi> but ſince they have ſeen you, they all draw back; though we have great reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you intend to drive us away, and ſettle the country; or elſe, why do you come to fight in the land that God has given us?"</p>
                  <p>I ſaid, we did not intend to take the land from them; but only to drive the <hi>French</hi> away. They ſaid, they knew better; for that they were informed ſo by our greateſt traders; and ſome Juſtices of the Peace had told them the ſame, and the <hi>French,</hi> ſaid they, tell us much the ſame thing,—"that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> intend to deſtroy us, and take our lands from us; but, that they are only come to defend us and our lands;" but the land is ours, and not theirs; therefore, we ſay, if you will be at peace with us, we will ſend the <hi>French</hi> home. It is you that have begun the war, and it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that you hold faſt, and be not diſcouraged, in the work of peace. We love you more than you love us; for when we take any priſoners from you, we treat them as our own children. We are poor, and yet we clothe them as well as we can, though you ſee our children are as naked as at the firſt. By this you may ſee
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:034421_0456_0FFDA17AD1A7A358"/>
that our hearts are better than yours. It is plain that you white people are the cauſe of this war; why do not you and the <hi>French</hi> fight in the old country, and on the ſea? Why do you come to fight on our land? This makes every body believe, you want to take the land from us by force, and ſettle it.<note n="*" place="bottom">The Indians, having plenty of land, are no niggards of it. They ſometimes give large tracts to their friends freely; and when they ſell it, they make moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous bargains But ſome <hi>fraudulent purchaſes,</hi> in which they were groſsly impoſed on, and ſome <hi>violent intruſions,</hi> imprudently and wickedly made without purchaſe, have rendered them jealous that we intend finally to take all from them by force. We ſhould endeavour to recover our credit with them by fair purchaſes and honeſt payments; and then there is no doubt but they will readily ſell us, at reaſonable rates, as much, from time to time, as we can poſſibly have occaſion for.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>I told them, "Brothers, as for my part, I have not one foot of land, nor do I deſire to have any; and if I had any land, I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther give it to you, than take any from you. Yes, brothers, if I die, you will get a little more land from me; for I ſhall then no longer walk on that ground, which God has made. We told you that you ſhould keep nothing in your heart, but bring it before the council fire, and before the Governor, and his council; they will readily hear you; and I promiſe you, what they anſwer they will ſtand to. I further read to you what agreements they made about <hi>Wioming,</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">The agreement made with <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> that he ſhould enjoy the <hi>Wioming</hi> lands, and have houſes built there for him and his people.</note> and they ſtand to them."</p>
                  <p>They ſaid, "Brother, your heart is good, you ſpeak always ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely; but we know there are always a great number of people that want to get rich; they never have enough: look, we do not want to be rich, and take away that which others have. God has given you the tame creatures; we do not want to take them from you, God has given to us the deer, and other wild creatures, which we muſt feed on; and we rejoice in that which ſprings out of the ground, and thank God for it. Look now, my brother, the white people think we have no brains in our heads; but that they are great and big, and that makes them make war with us: we are but a little handful to what you are; but remember, when you look for a wild turkey you cannot always find it, it is ſo little it hides itſelf under the buſhes: and when you hunt for a rattle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnake, you cannot find it; and perhaps it will bite you before you ſee it. However, ſince you are ſo great and big, and we ſo little, do you uſe your greatneſs and ſtrength in compleating this work of peace. This is the firſt time that we ſaw or heard of you, ſince the war begun, and we have great reaſon to think about it, ſince

ſuch a great body of you comes into our lands<note n="*" place="bottom">The army under <hi>General Forbes.</hi>
                     </note>. It is told us, that you and the <hi>French</hi> contrived the war, to waſte the <hi>Indians</hi> between you; and that you and the <hi>French</hi> intended to divide the land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you: this was told us by the chief of the <hi>Indian</hi> traders; and they ſaid further, brothers, this is the laſt time we ſhall come among you; for the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> intend to kill all the <hi>Indians,</hi> and then divide the land among themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Then they addreſſed themſelves to me, and ſaid, "Brother, I ſuppoſe you know ſomething about it; or has the Governor ſtopped your mouth, that you cannot tell us?"</p>
                  <p>Then I ſaid, "Brothers, I am very ſorry to ſee you ſo jealous. I am your own fleſh and blood, and ſooner than I would tell you any ſtory that would be of hurt to you, or your children, I would ſuffer death: and if I did not know that it was the deſire of the Governor, that we ſhould renew our old brotherly love and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that ſubſiſted between our grandfathers, I would not have undertaken this journey.

                  <p>Then I ſaid, "My brothers, I know you have been wrongly perſuaded by many wicked people; for you muſt know, that there are a great many Papiſts in the country, in <hi>French</hi> intereſt, who appear like gentlemen, and have ſent many runaway <hi>Iriſh</hi> papiſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants<note n="†" place="bottom">The <hi>Indian</hi> land is uſed to buy the tranſported <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and other convicts, as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, to be employed in carrying up the goods among the <hi>Indians:</hi> many of thoſe ran <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Mem. There are a great number of <hi>Iriſh</hi> traders now among the <hi>Indians,</hi> who have always endeavoured to ſpirit up the <hi>Indians</hi> againſt the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> which made ſome, that I was acquainted with from their infancy, deſire the chiefs to enquire of me, for that they were certain I would ſpeak the truth.</p>

                     <hi>Piſquetumen</hi> now told me, we could not go to the General, that it was very dangerous, the <hi>French</hi> having ſent out ſeveral ſcouts to wait for me on the road.

                  <p>—2d. I bade <hi>Shingas</hi> to make haſte and diſpatch me, and once more deſired to know of them, if it was poſſible for them to guide me to the General.

                  <p>—3d. To-day I found myſelf unwell, and made a little tea, which refreſhed me: had many very pretty diſcourſes with <hi>George.</hi> In the afternoon they called a council together, and gave me the following anſwer in council; the ſpeaker addreſſing the Governor and people of <hi>Pennſylvania:</hi>

One of our great captains, when he heard it, immediately took hold of it as well as myſelf.

                  <p>"I love that which is good, like as our grandfathers did: they choſe to ſpeak the ſentiments of their mind: all the <hi>Five Nations</hi> know me, and know that I always ſpoke truth; and ſo you ſhall find, when I come to your council fire." Gives a ſtring.</p>

                  <p>—4th. Preſent, <hi>Shingas,</hi> King <hi>Beaver, Piſquetumen,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others. I aſked what they meant by ſaying, <hi>"They had not rightly heard me yet."</hi> They ſaid,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="88" facs="unknown:034421_0461_0FFDA144E674AA60"/>"Brother, you very well know that you have collected all your young men about the country, which makes a large body;<note n="*" place="bottom">Meaning General Forbes's army.</note> and now they are ſtanding <hi>before our doors;</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">
                        <hi>I, E.</hi> Juſt ready to enter our country.</note> you come with good news, and fine ſpeeches. Brother, this is what makes us jealous, and we do not know what to think of it: if you had brought the news of peace before your army had begun to march, it would have cauſed a great deal more good. We do not ſo readily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you, becauſe a great many great men and traders have told us, long before the war, that you and the <hi>French</hi> intended to join and cut all the <hi>Indians</hi> off. Theſe were people of your own colour, and your own countrymen; and ſome told us to join the <hi>French;</hi> for that they would be our fathers: beſides, many runaways have told us the ſame ſtory; and ſome we took priſoners told us how you would uſe us, if you caught us: therefore, brother, I ſay, we cannot conclude, at this time, but muſt ſee and hear you once more." And further they ſaid,</p>
                  <p>"Now, brother, you are here with us, you are our fleſh and blood, ſpeak from the bottom of your heart, will not the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> join together to cut off the <hi>Indians?</hi> Speak, brother, from your heart, and tell us the truth, and let us know who were the beginners of the war."</p>
                  <p>Then I delivered myſelf thus:</p>
                  <p>"Brothers, I love you from the bottom of my heart. I am extremely ſorry to ſee the jealouſy ſo deeply rooted in your hearts and minds. I have told you the truth; and yet, if I was to tell it you a hundred times, it ſeems you would not rightly believe me. My <hi>Indian</hi> brothers, I wiſh you would draw your hearts to God, that he may convince you of the truth.</p>
                  <p>"I do now declare, before God, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> never did, nor never will, join with the <hi>French</hi> to deſtroy you. As far as I know, the <hi>French</hi> are the beginners of this war. Brothers, about twelve years ago, you may remember, they had war with the Engliſh, and they both agreed to articles of peace.

                        </gap> Breton</hi> in <hi>Acadia,</hi> but the <hi>French</hi> never gave up the part of that country, which they had agreed to give up; and, in a very little time, made their <hi>Children</hi> ſtrike the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> This was the firſt cauſe of the war. Now, brothers; if any body ſtrike you three times, one after another, you ſtill ſit ſtill and conſider: they ſtrike you again, then, my brothers, you ſay, it is time, and you will riſe up to defend yourſelves. Now, my brothers, this is exactly the caſe between the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Conſider farther,
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:034421_0462_0FFDA146E4A024F8"/>
my brothers, what a great number of our poor back inhabitants have been killed ſince the <hi>French</hi> came to the <hi>Ohio.</hi> The French are the cauſe of their death, and if they were not there, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would not trouble themſelves to go there. They go no where to war, but where the French are. Thoſe wicked people that ſet you at variance with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by telling you many wicked ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, are papiſts in French pay: beſides, there are many among us, in the <hi>French</hi> ſervice, who appear like gentlemen, and buy Iriſh papiſt ſervants, and promiſe them great rewards to run away to you and ſtrengthen you againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by making them appear as black as devils."</p>
                  <p>This day arrived here two hundred <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> on their way to <hi>fort Duqueſne.</hi> They ſtaid all night. In the middle of the night king <hi>Beaver</hi>'s daughter died, on which a great many guns were fired in the town.</p>
                  <p>—5th. It made a general ſtop in my journey. The <hi>French</hi> ſaid to their Children, they ſhould catch me privately, or get my ſcalp. The commander wanted to examine me, as he was going to <hi>fort Duqueſne.</hi> When they told me of it, I ſaid, as he was going to <hi>fort Duqueſne,</hi> he might enquire about me there: I had nothing at all to ſay, or do with the <hi>French:</hi> they would tell them every particular they wanted to know in the fort. They all came into the houſe where I was, as if they would ſee a new creature.</p>
                  <p>In the afternoon there came ſix <hi>Indians,</hi> and brought three Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man priſoners, and two ſcalps of the <hi>Catabaws.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As <hi>Daniel</hi> blamed the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that they never paid him for his trouble, I aſked him whether he was pleaſed with what I paid him. He ſaid, no. I ſaid, "Brother, you took as much as you pleaſed." I aſked you, whether you was ſatisfied; you ſaid, yes. I told him, I was aſhamed to hear him blame the country ſo. I bid him, "You ſhall have for this journey whatever you deſire, when I reach the inhabitants."</p>
                  <p>—6th. <hi>Piſquetumen, Tom Hickman</hi> and <hi>Shingas</hi> told me,</p>
                  <p>"Brother, it is good that you have ſtayed ſo long with us; we love to ſee you, and wiſh to ſee you here longer; but ſince you are ſo deſirous to go, you may ſet off to morrow: <hi>Piſquetumen</hi> has brought you here, and he may carry you home again: you have ſeen us, and we have talked a great deal together, which we have not done for a long time before. Now, Brother, we love you, but cannot help wondering why the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> do not make up with one another, and tell one another not to fight on our land."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="90" facs="unknown:034421_0463_0FFDA22BB1BF2738"/>I told them, "Brother, if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> told the <hi>French</hi> ſo a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times, they never would go away. Brother, you know ſo long as the world has ſtood there has not been ſuch a war. You know when the French lived on the other ſide, the war was there, and here we lived in peace. Conſider how many thouſand men are killed, and how many houſes are burned ſince the <hi>French</hi> lived here; if they had not been here it would not have been ſo; you know we do not blame you; we blame the <hi>French;</hi> they are the cauſe of this war; therefore, we do not come to hurt you, but to chaſtiſe the <hi>French."</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They told me, that at the great council, held at <hi>Onondago,</hi> among the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> before the war began (<hi>Conrad Weiſer</hi> was there, and wrote every thing down) it was ſaid to the <hi>Indians</hi> at the <hi>Ohio,</hi> that they ſhould let the <hi>French</hi> alone there, and leave it entirely to the <hi>Five Nations;</hi> the <hi>Five Nations</hi> would know what to do with them. Yet ſoon after two hundred <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> came and built <hi>Fort Duqueſne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>King <hi>Beaver</hi> and <hi>Shingas</hi> ſpoke to <hi>Piſquetumen,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>"Brother, you told us that the Governor of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> and <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> took this man out of their boſoms, and put him into your boſom, that you ſhould bring him here; and you have brought him here to us; and we have ſeen and heard him; and now we give him into your boſom, to bring him to the ſame place again, before the Governor; but do not let him quite looſe; we ſhall rejoice when we ſhall ſee him here again." They deſired me to ſpeak to the Governor, in their behalf, as follows:</p>
                  <p>"Brother, we beg you to remember our oldeſt brother, <hi>Piſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumen,</hi> and furniſh him with good cloathes, and reward him well for his trouble; for we all ſhall look upon him when he comes back."</p>
                  <p>—7th. When we were ready to go, they began to council which courſe we ſhould go, to be ſafeſt; and then they hunted for the horſes, but could not find them; and ſo we loſt that days journey.</p>
                  <p>It is a troubleſome croſs and heavy yoke to draw this people: They can puniſh and ſqueeze a body's heart to the utmoſt. I ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the reaſon they kept me here ſo long was by inſtigation of the <hi>French.</hi> I remember ſomebody told me, the <hi>French</hi> told them to keep me twelve days longer, for that they were afraid I ſhould get back too ſoon, and give information to the general. My heart has been very heavy here, becauſe they kept me for no purpoſe. The Lord knows how they have been counſelling about my life; but they did not know who was my protector and deliverer: I believe
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:034421_0464_0FFDA1496DD10CB8"/>
my Lord has been too ſtrong againſt them; my enemies have done what lies in their power.</p>
                  <p>—8th. We prepared for our journey on the morning, and made ourſelves ready. There came ſome together and examined me what I had wrote yeſterday. I told them, I wondered what need they had to concern themſelves about my writing. They ſaid, if they knew I had wrote about the priſoners, they would not let me go out of the town. I told them what I writ was my duty to do. "Brothers, I tell you, I am not afraid of you, if there were a thouſand more. I have a good conſcience before God and man. I tell you I have wrote nothing about the priſoners. I tell you, Brothers, this is not good; there's a bad ſpirit in your heart, which breeds that jealouſy; and it will keep you ever in fear, that you will never get reſt. I beg you would pray to God, for grace to reſiſt that wicked ſpirit, that breeds ſuch wicked jealouſies in you; which is the reaſon you have kept me here ſo long. How often have I begged of you to diſpatch me? I am aſhamed to ſee you ſo jealous; I am not, in the leaſt, afraid of you. Have I not brought writings to you? and what, do you think I muſt not carry ſome home, to the Governor? or, ſhall I ſhut my mouth, and ſay nothing? Look into your own hearts, and ſee if it would be right or wrong, if any body gives a ſalutation to their friends, and it is not returned in the ſame way. You told me many times how kind you were to the priſoners, and now you are afraid that any of them ſhould ſpeak to me."</p>
                  <p>They told me, they had cauſe to be afraid; and then made a draught, and ſhewed me how they were ſurrounded with war. Then I told them, if they would be quiet, and keep at a diſtance, they need not fear. Then they went away, very much aſhamed, one after another. I told my men, that we muſt make haſte and go; and accordingly we ſet off, in the afternoon, from <hi>Kuſhkuſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kee,</hi> and came ten miles.</p>
                  <p>—9th. We took a little foot-path hardly to be ſeen. We loſt it, and went through thick buſhes, till we came to a mire, which we did not ſee, till we were in it; and <hi>Tom Hickman</hi> fell in, and almoſt broke his leg. We had hard work before we could get the horſe out again. The Lord helped me, that I got ſafe from my horſe. I and <hi>Piſquetumen</hi> had enough to do to come through. We paſſed many ſuch places: it rained all day; and we got a double portion of it, becauſe we received all that hung on the buſhes. We were as wet as if we were ſwimming all the day; and at night we laid ourſelves down in a ſwampy place to ſleep, where we had nothing but the heavens for our covering.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="92" facs="unknown:034421_0465_0FFDA1F42790DC48"/>—10th. We had but little to live on. <hi>Tom Hickman</hi> ſhot a deer on the road. Every thing here, upon the <hi>Ohio,</hi> is extremely dear, much more ſo than in <hi>Pennſylvania:</hi> I gave for one diſh of corn four hundred and ſixty <hi>wampum.</hi> They told me that the Governor of <hi>fort Duqueſne</hi> kept a ſtore of his own, and that all the <hi>Indians</hi> muſt come and buy the goods of him; and when they come and buy, he tells them, if they will go to war, they ſhall have as much goods as they pleaſe. Before I ſet off, I heard fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that a <hi>French</hi> captain who goes to all the <hi>Indian</hi> towns<note n="*" place="bottom">He was ſent to collect the <hi>Indians</hi> together, to attack General Forbes's army, once more, on their march.</note> came to <hi>Sacunck,</hi> and ſaid, "Children, will you not come and help your father againſt the <hi>Engliſh?"</hi> They anſwered, "Why ſhould we go to war againſt our brethren? They are now our friends." "O! Children," ſaid he, "I hope you do not own them for friends." "Yes," ſaid they, "We do; we are their friends, and we hope they will remain ours." "O! Children, ſaid he, you muſt not believe what you have heard, and what has been told you by that man." They ſaid to him, "Yes, we do believe him more than we do you: it was you that ſet us againſt them; and we will by and by have peace with them:" and then he ſpoke not a word more, but returned to the fort. So, I hope, ſome good is done: praiſed be the name of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>—11th. Being Monday, we went over <hi>Antigoc:</hi> we went down a very ſteep hill, and our horſes ſlipt ſo far, that I expected, every moment, they would fall heels over head. We found freſh <hi>Indian</hi> tracts on the other ſide of the river. We croſſed <hi>Allegheny</hi> river, and went through the buſhes upon a high hill, and ſlept upon the ſide of the mountain, without fire, for fear of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. It was a cold night, and I had but a thin blanket to cover myſelf.</p>
                  <p>—12th. We made a little fire, to warm ourſelves in the morning. Our horſes began to be weary with climbing up and down theſe ſteep mountains. We came this night to the top of a mountain, where we found a log-houſe. Here we made a ſmall fire, juſt to boil ourſelves a little victuals. The <hi>Indians</hi> were very much afraid, and lay with their guns and tomhocks on all night. They heard ſomebody run and whiſper in the night. I ſlept very ſound, and in the morning they aſked me, if I was not afraid the enemy <hi>Indians</hi> would kill me. I ſaid, "No, I am not afraid of the <hi>Indians,</hi> nor the devil himſelf: I fear my great Creator, God." "Aye, they ſaid, you know you will go to a good place when you die, but we do not know that: that makes us afraid."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="93" facs="unknown:034421_0466_0FFDA23396900428"/>—13th. In the afternoon we twice croſſed <hi>Chowatin,</hi> and came to <hi>Poncheſtanning,</hi> an old deſerted <hi>Indian</hi> town, that lies on the ſame creek. We went through a bad ſwamp, where were very thick ſharp thorns, ſo that they tore our cloaths and fleſh, both hands and face, to a bad degree. We had this kind of road all the day. In the evening we made a fire, and then they heard ſomething ruſh, in the buſhes, as though they heard ſomebody walk. Then we went about three gun-ſhot from our fire, and could not find a place to lie down on, for the innumerable rocks; ſo that we were obliged to get ſmall ſtones to fill up the hollow places in the rocks, for our bed; but it was very uneaſy; almoſt ſhirt and ſkin grew together. They kept watch one after another all night.</p>
                  <p>—14th. In the morning, I aſked them what made them afraid. They ſaid, I knew nothing; the <hi>French</hi> had ſet a great price on my head; and they knew there was gone out a great ſcout to lie in wait for me. We went over great mountains and a very bad road.</p>
                  <p>—15th. We came to <hi>Suſquehanna,</hi> and croſſed it ſix times, and came to <hi>Catawaweſhink,</hi> where had been an old <hi>Indian</hi> town. In the evening there came three <hi>Indians,</hi> and ſaid they ſaw two <hi>Indian</hi> tracks, which came to the place where we ſlept, and turned back, as if to give information of us to a party; ſo that we were ſure they followed us.</p>
                  <p>—16th and 17th. We croſſed the mountain.</p>
                  <p>—18th. Came to the <hi>Big Iſland,</hi> where having nothing to live on, we were obliged to ſtay to hunt.</p>
                  <p>—19th. We met 20 warriors, who were returning from the inhabitants, with five priſoners and one ſcalp; ſix of them were <hi>Delawares,</hi> the reſt <hi>Mingoes.</hi> We ſat down all in one ring to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. I informed them where I had been, and what was done; they aſked me to go back a little, and ſo I did, and ſlept all night with them. I informed them of the particulars of the peace pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; they ſaid, "If they had known ſo much before, they would not have gone to war. Be ſtrong; if you make a good peace, then we will bring all the priſoners back again." They killed two deer, and gave me one.</p>
                  <p>—20th. We took leave of each other, and went on our journey, and arrived the 22d at <hi>fort Auguſta,</hi> in the afternoon, very weary and hungry; but greatly rejoiced of our return from this tedious journey.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="94" facs="unknown:034421_0467_0FFDA17D6087E568"/>There is not a prouder, or more high minded people, in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, than the Indians. They think themſelves the wiſeſt and prudenteſt men in the world; and that they can over-power both the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> when they pleaſe. The white people are, in their eyes, nothing at all. They ſay, that through their conjur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing craft they can do what they pleaſe, and nothing can withſtand them. In their way of ſighting they have this method, to ſee that they firſt ſhoot the officers and commanders; and then, they ſay, we ſhall be ſure to have them. They alſo ſay, that if their conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers run through the middle of our people, no bullet can hurt them. They ſay too, that when they have ſhot the commanders, the ſoldiers will all be confuſed, and will not know what to do. They ſay of themſelves, that every one of them is like a king and captain, and fights for himſelf. By this way they imagine they can overthrow any body of men, that may come againſt them. They ſay, "The <hi>Engliſh</hi> people are fools; they hold their guns half man high, and then let them ſnap; we take ſight and have them at a ſhot, and ſo do the <hi>French;</hi> they do not only ſhoot with a bullet, but big ſwan ſhot." They ſay, the French load with a bullet and ſix ſwan-ſhot. They further ſay, "We take care to have the firſt ſhot at our enemies, and then they are half dead before they begin to fight."</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> are a people full of jealouſy, and will not eaſily truſt any body; and they are very eaſily affronted, and brought into jealouſy; then afterwards they will have nothing at all to do with thoſe they ſuſpect; and it is not brought ſo eaſy out of their minds; they keep it to their graves, and leave the ſeed of it in their children and grand children's minds; ſo, if they can, they will revenge themſelves for every imagined injury. They are a very diſtruſtful people. Through their imagination and reaſon they think themſelves a thouſand times ſtronger than all all other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <hi>Fort du Queſne</hi> is ſaid to be undermined. The <hi>French</hi> have given out, that, if we overpower them, and they ſhould die, we ſhould certainly all die with them. When I came to the fort, the garriſon, it was ſaid, conſiſted of about one thouſand four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men; and I am told they will now be full three thouſand <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> They are almoſt all <hi>Canadians,</hi> and will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly meet the general before he comes to the fort, in an ambuſh. You may depend upon it the <hi>French</hi> will make no open field-battle, as in the old country, but lie in ambuſh. The <hi>Canadians</hi> are all hunters. The <hi>Indians</hi> have agreed to draw back; but how far we may give credit to their promiſes the Lord knows. It is the beſt way to be on our guard againſt them, as if they really could with one thouſand overpower eight thouſand.</p>

                     <pb n="95" facs="unknown:034421_0468_0FFDA1C20A9BAAF0"/>Thirty-two nights I lay in the woods; the heavens were any covering. The dew came ſo hard ſometimes, that it pinched cloſe to the ſkin. There was nothing that laid ſo heavy on my heart, as the man that went along with me. He thwarted me in every thing I ſaid or did; not that he did it againſt me, but againſt the country, on whoſe buſineſs I was ſent; I was afraid he would overthrow what I went about. When he was with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> he would ſpeak againſt the <hi>French,</hi> and when with the <hi>French</hi> againſt the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> The <hi>Indians</hi> obſerved that he was a falſe fellow, and deſired me, that I would not bring him any more, to tranſact any buſineſs between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and them; and told me, it was through his means I could not have the liberty to talk with the priſoners.</p>
                  <p>Praiſe and glory be to the <hi>Lamb,</hi> that has been ſlain, and brought me through the country of dreadful jealouſy and miſtruſt, where the prince of this world has his rule and government over the children of diſobedience.</p>
                  <p>The Lord has preſerved me through all the dangers and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that I have ever been under. He directed me according to his will, by his holy ſpirit. I had no one to converſe with but him. He brought me under a thick, heavy, and dark cloud, into the open air; for which I adore, praiſe and worſhip the Lord my God, that I know has graſped me in his hands, and has forgiven me for all ſins, and ſent and waſhed my heart with his moſt precious blood; that I now live not for myſelf, but for him that made me; and to do his holy will is my pleaſure. I own that, in the children of light, there dwells another kind of ſpirit, than there does in the children of this world; therefore, theſe two ſpirits cannot rightly agree in fellowſhip.</p>

We roſe early, and I ſpoke to <hi>Piſquetomen</hi> a great deal; he was very ſick, and could hardly ſtir; when we overtook the reſt, we found them in the ſame condition; and they ſeemed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, from going the way to the general; and wanted to go through the woods. I told them, I was ſorry to ſee them waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and reminded them, that when I went to their towns, I was not ſent to the <hi>French,</hi> but when your old men inſiſted on my go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, I followed their advice, and went; and as the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral is, in the king's name, over the provinces, in matters of war

They then reſolved to go to <hi>Harris's</hi> fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and conſider about it as they went;—we arrived there late in the night.</p>
               <p>—29th. In the morning, the two <hi>Cayugas</hi> being moſt deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of going through the woods, the others continued irreſolute<note n="†" place="bottom">They were afraid of going where our people were all in arms, leſt ſome of the indiſcreet ſoldiers might kill them.</note>; upon which I told them, "I wiſh you would go with good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and with hearty reſolution," and repeated what I had ſaid to them yeſterday, and reminded them, as they were meſſengers, they ſhould conſider what would be the beſt for their whole nation; "conſult among yourſelves, and let me know your true mind and determination;" and I informed them, I could not go with them, unleſs they would go to the general, as I had meſſages to deliver him. After which, having conſulted together, <hi>Peſquitomen</hi> came and gave me his hand, and ſaid, "Brother, here is my hand, we have all joined to go with you, and we put ourſelves under your protection to bring us ſafe through, and to ſecure us from all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger." We came that night to <hi>Garliſle</hi> and found a ſmall houſe without the fort, for the <hi>Indians</hi> to be by themſelves, and hired a woman to dreſs their victuals, which pleaſed them well.</p>
               <p>—30th. Setting out early, we came to <hi>Shippenſburg,</hi> and were lodged in the fort, where the <hi>Indians</hi> had a houſe to themſelves.</p>
               <p>—31ſt. Set out early; in our paſſing by <hi>Chambers</hi> Fort, ſome of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> people, knowing ſome of the <hi>Indians,</hi> in a raſh man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner exclaimed againſt them, and we had ſome difficulty to get them off clear. At fort <hi>London</hi> we met about ſixteen of the <hi>Cherokees,</hi> who came in a friendly manner to our <hi>Indians,</hi> enquiring for <hi>Bill Sockum,</hi> and ſhewed the pipe <note n="‡" place="bottom">A calumet pipe; the ſignal of peace.</note> they had received from the <hi>Shawa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe,</hi> and gave it, according to their cuſtom, to ſmoak out of, and ſaid, they hoped they were friends of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> They knew me. <hi>Peſquitomen</hi> begged me to give him ſome <hi>wampum,</hi> that he might ſpeak to them: I gave him 400 white <hi>wampum,</hi> and he then ſaid to them:—"We formerly had friendſhip one with another; we are only meſſengers, and cannot ſay much, but by theſe ſtrings we let you know we are friends, and we are about ſettling a peace with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and wiſh to be at peace alſo with you, and all

other <hi>Indians."</hi>—And informed them further, they came from a treaty, which was held at <hi>Eaſton,</hi> between the <hi>Eight United Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and their confederates, and the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> in which peace was eſtabliſhed; and ſhewed them the two meſſengers from the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> who were going, with them, to make it known to all the <hi>Indians</hi> to the weſtward. Then the <hi>Cherokees</hi> anſwered and ſaid; "they ſhould be glad to know how far the friendſhip was to reach; they, for themſelves, wiſhed it might reach from the ſun-riſe to the ſun-ſet; for, as they were in friendſhip with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they would be at peace with all their friends, and at war with their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies."</p>
               <p>Nov. 1. We reached fort <hi>Littleton,</hi> in company with the <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rokees,</hi> and were lodged, in the fort; they, and our <hi>Indians,</hi> in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct places; and they entertained each other with ſtories of their warlike adventures.</p>
               <p>—2d. <hi>Peſquitomen</hi> ſaid to me, "you have led us this way, through the fire; if any miſchief ſhould befal us, we ſhall lay it entirely to you; for we think it was your doing, to bring us this way; you ſhould have told us at <hi>Eaſton,</hi> if it was neceſſary we ſhould go to the general."</p>
               <p>I told him, "that I had informed the great men, at <hi>Eaſton,</hi> that I then thought it would be beſt not to let them go from thence, till they had ſeen the general's letter; and aſſured them that it was agreeable to the general's pleaſure."</p>
               <p>—3d. <hi>Peſquitomen</hi> began to argue with captain <hi>Bull</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hays,</hi> upon the ſame ſubject, as they did with me, when I went to them with my firſt meſſage; which was, "that they ſhould tell them, whether the general would claim the land as his own, when he ſhould drive the <hi>French</hi> away? or, whether the <hi>Engliſh</hi> thought to ſettle the country? We are always jealous the <hi>Engliſh</hi> will take the land from us. Look, brother, what makes you come with ſuch a large body of men, and make ſuch large roads into our country; we could drive away the <hi>French</hi> ourſelves, without your coming into our country."</p>
               <p>Then I deſired captain <hi>Bull</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hays</hi> to be careful how they argued with the <hi>Indians;</hi> and be ſure to ſay nothing, that might affront them; for it may prove to our diſadvantage, when we come amongſt them. This day we came to <hi>Rays-town,</hi> and with much difficulty got a place to lodge the <hi>Indians</hi> by themſelves, to their ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>—4th. We intended to ſet out, but our <hi>Indians</hi> told us, the <hi>Cherokees</hi> had deſired them to ſtay that day, as they intended to hold a council; and they deſired us to read over to them the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor's

meſſage; which we accordingly did. <hi>Peſquitomen,</hi> finding <hi>Jenny Frazer</hi> there, who had been their priſoner, and eſcaped, ſpoke to her a little raſhly. Our <hi>Indians,</hi> waiting all the day, and the <hi>Cherokees</hi> not ſending to them, were diſpleaſed.</p>
               <p>—5th. Roſe early, and, it raining ſmartly, we aſked our <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> if they would go; which they took time to conſult about.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cherokees</hi> came and told them, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had killed about thirty of their people, for taking ſome horſes; which they reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much; and told our <hi>Indians</hi> they had better go home, than go any farther with us, leſt they ſhould meet with the ſame. On hearing this, I told them how I had heard it happened; upon which our <hi>Indians</hi> ſaid, they had behaved like fools, and brought the miſchief on themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peſquitomen,</hi> before we went from hence, made it up with <hi>Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Frazer,</hi> and they parted good friends; and though it rained hard, we ſet out at 10 o'clock, and got to the foot of the <hi>Alleghenny,</hi> and lodged at the firſt run of water.</p>
               <p>—6th. One of our horſes went back; we hunted a good while for him. Then we ſet off, and found one of the worſt roads that ever was travelled until <hi>Stoney creek.</hi> Upon the road we overtook a great number of pack horſes; whereon <hi>Peſquitomen</hi> ſaid, "Brother, now you ſee, if you had not come to us before, this road would not be ſo ſafe as it is; now you ſee, we could have deſtroyed all this people on the road, and great miſchief would have been done, if you had not ſtopt, and drawn our people back."— We were informed that the general was not yet gone to fort <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſne,</hi> wherefore <hi>Peſquitomen</hi> ſaid, he was glad, and expreſſed, "If I can come to our towns before the general begins the attack, I know our people will draw back, and leave the <hi>French."</hi>—We lodged this night at <hi>Stoney creek.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>—7th. We aroſe early, and made all the haſte we could on our journey; we croſſed the large creek, <hi>Rehempalin,</hi> near <hi>Lawrel hill.</hi> Upon this hill we overtook the artillery; and came, before ſun ſet, to <hi>Loyal Hanning.</hi> We were gladly received in the camp by the general, and moſt of the people. We made our fire near the other <hi>Indian</hi> camps; which pleaſed our people. Soon after ſome of the officers came, and ſpoke very raſhly to our <hi>Indians,</hi> in reſpect to their conduct to our people; at which they were much diſpleaſed, and anſwered as raſhly, and ſaid, "they did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſuch uſage; for they were come upon a meſſage of peace; if we had a mind to war, they knew how to help themſelves; and that they were not afraid of us."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="unknown:034421_0474_0FFDA16B1B9A96E0"/>—8th. At eleven o'clock the general called the <hi>Indians</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the <hi>Cherokees</hi> and <hi>Catawbas</hi> being preſent; he ſpake to them in a kind and loving manner, and bid them heartily welcome to his camp, and expreſſed his joy to ſee them, and deſired them to give his compliments to all their kings and captains:—He deſired them that had any love for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> nation, to withdraw from the <hi>French;</hi> for if he ſhould find them among the <hi>French,</hi> he muſt treat them as enemies, as he ſhould advance with a large army very ſoon, and cannot wait longer on account of the winter ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. After that he drank the king's health, and all that wiſh well to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> nation; then he drank king <hi>Beaver's, Shingas',</hi> and all the warrior's healths, and recommended us (the meſſengers) to their care; and deſired them to give credit to what we ſhould ſay. After that we went to another houſe with the general alone; and he ſhewed them the belt, and ſaid, he would furniſh them with a writing, for both the belt and ſtring; and after a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe more, our <hi>Indians</hi> parted in love, and well ſatisfied. And we made all neceſſary preparation for our journey.</p>
               <p>—9th. Some of the colonels and chief commanders wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how I came through ſo many difficulties, and how I could rule and bring theſe people to reaſon, making no uſe of gun or ſword. I told them, it is done by no other means than by faith. Then they aſked me, if I had faith to venture myſelf to come ſafe through with my companions. I told them, it was in my heart to pray for them, "you know that the Lord has given many promiſes to his ſervants, and what he promiſes, you may depend upon, he will perform."—Then they wiſhed us good ſucceſs. We waited till almoſt noon for the writing of the general. We were eſcorted by an hundred men, rank and file, commanded by captain <hi>Haſelet;</hi> we paſſed through a tract of good land, about ſix miles on the old trading path, and came to the creek again, where there is a large fine bottom, well timbered; from thence we came upon a hill, to an advanced breaſt work, about ten miles from the camp, well ſituated for ſtrength, facing a ſmall branch of the aforeſaid creek; the hill is ſteep down, perpendicular about twenty feet, on the ſouth ſide; which is a great defence; and on the weſt ſide the breaſt-work about ſeven feet high, where we encamped that night: Our <hi>Indian</hi> companions heard that we were to part in the morning, and that twelve men were to be ſent with us, and the others, part of the company, to go towards fort <hi>Duqueſne.</hi> Our <hi>Indians</hi> deſired that the captain would ſend twenty men, inſtead of twelve; that if any accident ſhould happen, they could be more able to defend themſelves in returning back; "for we know, ſay they, the enemy will follow the ſmalleſt party." It began to rain.

Within five miles from the breaſt-work we departed from captain <hi>Haſelet;</hi> he kept the old trading path to the <hi>Ohio.</hi> Lieutenant <hi>Hays</hi> was ordered to accompany us to the <hi>Alleghenny</hi> river <note n="*" place="bottom">The Ohio, as it is called by the Sennecas. Alleghenny is the name of the ſame river in the Delaware language. Both words ſignify the fine, or fair river.</note> with fourteen men. We went the path that leads along, the <hi>Loyal Hanning</hi> creek, where there is a rich fine bottom, land well tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, good ſprings and ſmall creeks. At four o'clock we were alarmed by three men, in <hi>Indian</hi> dreſs; and preparation was made on both ſides, for defence. <hi>Iſaac Still</hi> ſhewed a white token, and <hi>Peſquitomen</hi> gave an <hi>Indian <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>lloo;</hi> after which they threw down their bundles, and ran away as faſt as they could. We afterwards took up their bundles, and found that it was a ſmall party of our men, that had been long out. We were ſorry that we had ſcared them; for they loſt their bundles with all their food. Then, I held a conference with our <hi>Indians,</hi> and aſked them, if it would not be good, to ſend one of our <hi>Indians</hi> to <hi>Log ſtown</hi> and <hi>fort Duqueſne,</hi> and call the <hi>Indians</hi> from thence, before we arrive at <hi>Kuſhkuſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</hi> They all agreed it would not be good, as they were but meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers; it muſt be done by their chief men. The wolves made a terrible muſic this night.</p>
               <p>—11th. We ſtarted early, and came to the old <hi>Shawaneſe</hi> town, called <hi>Keckkeknepolin,</hi> grown up thick with weeds, briars and buſhes, that we ſcarcely could get through. <hi>Peſquitomen</hi> led us upon a ſteep hill, that our horſes could hardly get up; and <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Hickman's</hi> horſe tumbled, and rolled down the hill like a wheel; on which he grew angry, and would go no further with us, and ſaid, he would go by himſelf: It happened we found a path on the top of the hill. At three o'clock we came to <hi>Kiſke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meneco,</hi> an old <hi>Indian</hi> town, a rich bottom, well timbered, good fine <hi>Engliſh</hi> graſs, well watered, and lays waſte ſince the war be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan. We let our horſes ſeed here, and agreed that lieutenant <hi>Hays</hi> might go back with his party; and as they were ſhort of proviſions, we, therefore, gave them a little of ours, which they took very kind of us. <hi>Thomas Hickman</hi> could find no other road, and came to us again a little aſhamed; we were glad to ſee him; and we went about three miles farther, where we made a large fire. Here the <hi>Indians</hi> looked over their preſents, and grumbled at me; they thought, if they had gone the other way by <hi>Shamokin,</hi> they would have got more. Captain Bull ſpoke in their favour againſt me. Then I ſaid to them, "I am aſhamed to ſee you grumble about preſents; I thought you were ſent to eſtabliſh a peace." Though I confeſs I was not pleaſed that the <hi>Indians</hi> were ſo ſlightly fitted out from <hi>Eaſton,</hi> as the general had nothing to
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:034421_0476_0FFDA16D93B27B00"/>
give them, in the critical circumſtances he was in, fit for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>—12th. Early in the morning, I ſpoke to the <hi>Indians</hi> of my company, "Brethren, you have now paſſed through the heart of the country back and forward, likewiſe through the midſt of the army, without any difficulty or danger; you have ſeen and heard a great deal. When I was among you, at <hi>Alleghenny,</hi> you told me, I ſhould not regard what the common people would ſay, but only hearken to the chiefs; I ſhould take no bad ſtories along. I did accordingly; and when I left <hi>Alleghenny</hi> I dropt all evil reports, and only carried the agreeable news, which was pleaſing to all that heard it. Now, brethren, I beg of you to do the ſame, and to drop all evil reports, which you may have heard of bad people, and only to obſerve and keep what you have heard of our rulers, and the wiſe people, ſo that all your young men, women and children, may rejoice at our coming to them, and may have the benefit of it."</p>
               <p>They took it very kindly. After awhile they ſpoke in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing manner to us, and ſaid, "Brethren, when you come to <hi>Kuſhkuſhking,</hi> you muſt not mind the priſoners, and have nothing to do with them. Mr. <hi>Poſt,</hi> when he was firſt there, liſtened too much to the priſoners; the <hi>Indians</hi> were almoſt mad with him for it, and would have confined him for it; for, they ſaid, he had wrote ſomething of them."</p>
               <p>As we were hunting for our horſes, we found <hi>Thomas Hickman</hi>'s horſe dead, which rolled yeſterday down the hill. At one o'clock we came to the <hi>Alleghenny,</hi> to an old <hi>Shawano</hi> town, ſituated under a high hill on the eaſt, oppoſite an iſland of about one hundred acres, very rich land, well timbered. We looked for a place to croſs the river, but in vain; we then went ſmartly to work, and made a raft; we cut the wood, and carried it to the water ſide. The wolves and owls made a great noiſe in the night.</p>
               <p>—13th. We got up early, and boiled ſome chocolate for breakfaſt, and then began to finiſh our rafts; we cloathed ourſelves as well as we could in <hi>Indian</hi> dreſs; it was about two o'clock in the afternoon, before we all got over to the other ſide, near an old <hi>Indian</hi> town. The <hi>Indians</hi> told us, we ſhould not call Mr. <hi>Bull, captain,</hi> their young men would be mad that we brought a warrior there. We went up a ſteep hill, good land, to the creek <hi>Cowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wanick,</hi> where we made our fire. They wanted to hunt for meat, and looked for a road. Captain <hi>Bull</hi> ſhot a ſquirrel, and broke his gun. I cut fire wood, and boiled ſome chocolate for ſupper. The others came home, and brought nothing. <hi>Peſquitomen</hi> wanted
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:034421_0477_0FFDA185325694D8"/>
to hear the writing from the general, which we read to them, to their great ſatisfaction. This was the firſt night we ſlept in the open air. Mr. <hi>Bull</hi> took the tent along with him. We diſcourſed a good deal of the night together.</p>
               <p>—14th. We roſe early, and thought to make good progreſs on our way. At one o'clock <hi>Thomas Hickman</hi> ſhot a large buck; and, as our people were hungry for meat, we made our camp there, and called the water <hi>Buck run.</hi> In the evening we heard the great guns fire from <hi>fort Duqueſne.</hi> Whenever I looked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that place, I felt a diſmal impreſſion, the very place ſeemed ſhocking and dark. <hi>Peſquitomen</hi> looked his things over, and found a white belt, ſent by the commiſſioners of trade,<note n="*" place="bottom">Perſons appointed by law to manage the <hi>Indian</hi> trade, for the public; the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate trade, on account of its abuſes, being aboliſhed.</note> for the <hi>Indian</hi> affairs. We could find no writing concerning the belt, and did not know what was the ſignification thereof: They ſeemed much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to know it.</p>
               <p>—15th. We aroſe early, and had a good day's journey; we paſſed theſe two days through thick buſhes of briars and thorns; ſo that it was very difficult to get through. We croſſed the creek <hi>Paquakonink;</hi> the land is very indifferent. At twelve o'clock we croſſed the road from <hi>Venango</hi> to <hi>fort Duqueſne.</hi> We went weſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Kuſhkuſhking,</hi> about ſixteen miles from the fort.

               <p>—16th. We met two <hi>Indians</hi> on the road, and ſat down with them to dinner. They informed us that no body was at home, at <hi>Kuſhkuſhking;</hi> that one hundred and ſixty, from that town, were gone to war againſt our party. We croſſed the above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned creek; good land, but hilly. Went down a long valley to <hi>Beaver</hi> creek, through old <hi>Kuſhkuſhking,</hi> a large ſpot of land, about three miles long; they both went with us to the town; one of them rode before us, to let the people in the town know of our coming; we found there but two men, and ſome women. Thoſe, that were at home, received us kindly. <hi>Peſquitomen</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired us to read the meſſage to them that were there.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="unknown:034421_0478_0FFDA16F82613508"/>—17th. There were five <hi>Frenchmen</hi> in the town; the reſt were gone to war. We held a council with <hi>Delaware George,</hi> delivered him the ſtring and preſents, that were ſent to him; and informed him of the general's ſentiments, and what he deſired of them; upon which he agreed, and complied to go with Mr. <hi>Bull,</hi> to the general. Towards night <hi>Keckkenepalin</hi> came home from the war, and told us the diſagreeable news, that they had fallen in with that party, that had guided us; they had killed Lieutenant <hi>Hays,</hi> and four more, and took five priſoners, the others got clear off. They had a ſkirmiſh with them within twelve miles of <hi>fort Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſne.</hi> Further he told us, that one of the captives was to be burnt, which grieved us. By the priſoners they were informed of our arrival; on which they concluded to leave the <hi>French,</hi> and to hear what news we brought them. In the evening they brought a priſoner to town. We called the <hi>Indians</hi> together, that were at home, and explained the matter to them, and told them, as their own people had deſired the general to give them a guide to conduct them ſafe home, and by a misfortune, your people have fallen in with this party, and killed five and taken five priſoners; and we are now informed that one of them is to be burnt; "Conſider, my brethren, if you ſhould give us a guide, to bring us ſafe on our way home, and our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> ſhould fall in with you, how hard you would take it."</p>
               <p>They ſaid, "Brother, it is a hard matter, and we are ſorry it hath happened <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>." I anſwered, "Let us therefore ſpare no pains to relieve them from any cruelty." We could ſcarce find a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger, that would undertake to go to <hi>Sawcung,</hi> where the priſoner was to be bunt. We promiſed to one named <hi>Compaſs,</hi> 500 black wampum, and Mr. <hi>Hays</hi> gave him a ſhirt and a dollar, on which he promiſed to go. We ſent him as a meſſenger. By a ſtring of wampum I ſpoke theſe words, "Brethren, conſider the meſſengers are come home with good news, and three of your brethren, the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> with them. We deſire you would pity your own young men, women and children, and uſe no hardſhips towards the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, as having been guiding our party."</p>
               <p>Afterwards the warriors informed us, that their deſign had not been to go to war, but that they had a mind to go to the general, and ſpeak with him; and on the road the <hi>French</hi> made a diviſion among them, that they could not agree; after which they were diſcovered by the <hi>Cherokees</hi> and <hi>Catawbas,</hi> who ſled, and left their bundles, where they found an <hi>Engliſh</hi> colour. So <hi>Kekeuſcung</hi> told them he would go before them to the general, if they would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low low him; but they would not agree to it; and the <hi>French</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded them to fall upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at <hi>Loyal-hanning;</hi> they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:034421_0479_0FFDA19E0D578AE8"/>
did, and as they were driven back, they fell in with that party, that guided us, which they did not know. They ſeemed very ſorry for it.</p>
               <p>—18th. Captain <hi>Bull</hi> acted as commander, without letting us know any thing, or communicating with us. He and <hi>George</hi> re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>w. When the warriors were met, he then called us firſt to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and to hear what they had to ſay. The <hi>Indian</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered the priſoner to <hi>Bull</hi> and <hi>George,</hi> ſpoke as follows:</p>
               <p>"My brethren, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are at ſuch a diſtance from us, as if they were under ground, that I cannot hear them. I am very glad to hear from you ſuch good news; and I am very ſorry that it happened ſo, that I went to war. Now I let the general know, he ſhould conſider his young men, and if you ſhould have any of us, to ſet them at liberty, ſo as we do to you.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Peſquitomen</hi> ſaid, "As the Governor gave theſe three meſſengers into my boſom, ſo I now likewiſe, by this ſtring of wampum, give <hi>Bull</hi> into <hi>Delaware George</hi>'s boſom, to bring him ſafe to the general." Mr. <hi>Bull</hi> ſat down with the priſoner, who gave him ſome intelligence in writing; at which the <hi>Indians</hi> grew very jealous, and aſked them what they had to write there? I wrote a letter to the general by Mr. <hi>Bull.</hi> In the afternoon Mr. <hi>Bull, Delaware George,</hi> and <hi>Keſk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>epalen</hi> ſet out for the camp. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards night they brought in another priſoner. When Mr. <hi>Bull</hi> and company were gone, the <hi>Indians</hi> took the ſame priſoner, whom Mr. <hi>Bull</hi> had relieved, and bound him and carried him to another town, without our knowledge. I a thouſand times wiſhed Mr. <hi>Bull</hi> had never meddled in the affair, fearing they would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly puniſh, and bring the priſoner to confeſſion of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the writing.</p>
               <p>—19th. A great many of the warriors came home. The <hi>French</hi> had infuſed bad notions into the <hi>Indians,</hi> by means of the letters, they found upon Lieutenant <hi>Hays,</hi> who was killed, which they falſely interpreted to them, viz. That, in one letter it was wrote, that the general ſhould do all that was in his power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the <hi>French,</hi> and, in the mean time the meſſengers to the <hi>Indians</hi> ſhould do their utmoſt to draw the <hi>Indians</hi> back, and keep them together in conferences, till he, the general, had made a conqueſt of the <hi>French,</hi> and afterwards he ſhould fall upon all <hi>Indians,</hi> and deſtroy them. And, that, if we ſhould loſe our lives, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would carry on the war, ſo long as an <hi>Indian,</hi> or <hi>Frenchman</hi> was alive. Thereupon the French ſaid to the <hi>Indians;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="unknown:034421_0480_0FFDA187C61557B0"/>"Now you can ſee, my children, how the <hi>Engliſh</hi> want to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you, and if it would not offend you, I would go and knock theſe meſſengers on the head, before you ſhould be deceived by them." One of the <hi>Indian</hi> captains ſpoke to the <hi>French</hi> and ſaid, "To be ſure it would offend us, if you ſhould offer to knock them on the head. If you have a mind to go to war, go to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> army, and knock them on the head, and not theſe three men, that come with a meſſage to us."</p>
               <p>After this ſpeech the <hi>Indians</hi> went all off, and left the <hi>French.</hi> Nevertheleſs it had enraged ſome of the young people, and made them ſuſpicious; ſo that it was a precarious time for us. I ſaid, "Brethren, have good courage, and be ſtrong; let not every wind diſturb your mind; let the <hi>French</hi> bring the letter here; for, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>After this all the young men were gathered together, <hi>Iſaac Still</hi> being in company. The young men ſaid, "One that had but half an eye could ſee that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> only intended to cheat them; and that it was beſt to knock every one of us meſſengers on the head."</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Iſaac</hi> began to ſpeak and ſaid, "I am aſhamed to hear ſuch talking from you; you are but boys like me; you ſhould not talk of ſuch a thing. There have been thirteen nations at <hi>Eaſton,</hi> where they have eſtabliſhed a firm peace with the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and I have heard that the Five Nations were always called the wiſeſt; go tell them that they are fools, and cannot ſee; and tell them that you are kings, and wiſe men. Go and tell the <hi>Cayuga</hi> chiefs ſo, that are here; and you will become great men." Afterwards they were all ſtill, and ſaid not one word more.</p>
               <p>—20th. There came a great many more together in the town, and brought <hi>Henry Oſten,</hi> the ſerjeant, who was to have been burnt. They hallooed the war halloo; and the men and women beat him till he came into the houſe.<note n="†" place="bottom">When a priſoner is brought to an <hi>Indian</hi> town, he runs a kind of gauntlet thro' the mob; and every one, even the children, endeavour to have a ſtroke at him; but as ſoon as he can get into any of their huts, he is under protection, and refreſhments are adminiſtered to him.</note> It is a grievous and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy ſight to ſee our fellow mortals ſo abuſed. <hi>Iſaac Still</hi> had a long diſcourſe with the <hi>French</hi> captain; who made himſelf
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:034421_0481_0FFDA1F626313CA8"/>
great, by telling how he had fought the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at <hi>Loyal-Hanning. Iſaac</hi> rallied him, and ſaid he had ſeen them ſcalp horſes, and take others for food. The firſt he denied, but the ſecond he owned. <hi>Iſaac</hi> ran the captain quite down, before them all. The <hi>French</hi> captain ſpoke with the two <hi>Cayugas;</hi> at laſt the <hi>Cayugas</hi> ſpoke very ſharp to him, ſo that he grew pale, and was quite ſilent.</p>
               <p>Theſe three days paſt was precarious time for us. We were warned not to go far from the houſe; becauſe the people who came from the ſlaughter, having been driven back, were poſſeſſed with a murdering ſpirit; which led them as in a halter, in which they were catched, and with bloody vengeance were thirſty and drunk. This afforded a melancholy proſpect. <hi>Iſaac Still</hi> was himſelf du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious of our lives. We did not let Mr. <hi>Hays</hi> know of the dang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. I ſaid, "As God hath ſtopped the mouth of the lions, that they could not devour <hi>Daniel,</hi> ſo he will preſerve us from their fury, and bring us through." I had a diſcourſe with Mr. <hi>Hays</hi> concerning our meſſage, and begged him he would pray to God for grace and wiſdom, that he would grant us peace among this people. We will remain in ſtillneſs, and not look to our own credit. We are in the ſervice of our king and country. This people are rebellious in heart; now we are here to reconcile them again to the General, Governor, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> nation; to turn them again from their errors. And I wiſhed that God would grant us his grace, whereby we may do it; which I hope and believe he will do. Mr. <hi>Hays</hi> took it to heart and was convinced of all; which much rejoiced me. I begged <hi>Iſaac Still</hi> to watch over himſelf, and not to be diſcouraged; for I hoped the ſtorm would ſoon paſs by.</p>
               <p>In the afternoon all the captains gathered together in the middle town; they ſent for us, and deſired we ſhould give them informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our meſſage. Accordingly we did. We read the meſſage with great ſatisfaction to them. It was a great pleaſure both to them and us. The number of captains and counſellors were ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen. In the evening meſſengers arrived from <hi>fort Duqueſne,</hi> with a ſtring of wampum from the commander; upon which they all came together in the houſe where we lodged. The meſſengers delivered their ſtring, with theſe words from their father, the <hi>French</hi> King:</p>
               <p>"My children, come to me, and hear what I have to ſay. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> are coming with an army to deſtroy both you and me. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſire you immediately, my children, to haſten with all the young men; we will drive the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and deſtroy them. I, as a father, will tell you always what is beſt." He laid the ſtring before one of the captains. After a little converſation, the captain ſtood up
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:034421_0482_0FFDA18A32480E18"/>
and ſaid; "I have juſt heard ſomething of our brethren the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,</hi> which pleaſeth me much better. I will not go. Give it to the others, may be they will go." The meſſenger took up again the ſtring and ſaid, "He won't go, he has heard of the <hi>Engliſh."</hi>

Then we ſaw the <hi>French</hi> captain mortified to the uttermoſt; he looked as pale as death. The <hi>Indians</hi> diſcourſed and joked till midnight; and the <hi>French</hi> captain ſent meſſengers at midnight to <hi>fort Duqueſne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>—21ſt. We were informed that the general was within twenty miles of <hi>fort Duqueſne.</hi> As the <hi>Indians</hi> were afraid the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would come over the river <hi>Ohio,</hi> I ſpoke with ſome of the captains, and told them that, "I ſuppoſed the general intended to ſurround the <hi>French,</hi> and therefore muſt come to this ſide the river; but we aſſure you that he will not come to your towns to hurt you." I begged them to let the <hi>Shawaneſe</hi> at <hi>Logstown,</hi> know it, and gave them four ſtrings of 300 wampum, with this meſſage; "Brethren, we are arrived with good news, waiting for you; we deſire you to be ſtrong, and remember the ancient friendſhip your grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had with the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> We wiſh you would remember it, and pity your young men, women and children, and keep away from the <hi>French;</hi> and if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould come to ſurround the <hi>French,</hi> be not afraid. We aſſure you they won't hurt you,"</p>
               <p>—22d. <hi>Kittiuſkund</hi> came home, and ſent for us, being very glad to ſee us. He informed us, the general was within fifteen miles of the <hi>French fort;</hi> that the <hi>French</hi> had uncovered their houſes, and laid the roofs round the fort to ſet it on fire, and made ready to go off, and would demoliſh the fort, and let the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have the bare ground; ſaying; "they are not able to build a ſtrong fort this winter; and we will be early enough in the ſpring to deſtroy them. We will come with ſeventeen nations of <hi>Indians,</hi> and a great many <hi>French,</hi> and build a ſtone fort."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="unknown:034421_0483_0FFDA151371A04A0"/>The <hi>Indians</hi> danced round the fire till midnight, for joy of their brethren, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> coming. There went ſome ſcouting parties towards the army. Some of the captains told me, that <hi>Shamokin Daniel,</hi> who came with me in my former journey, had fairly ſold me to the <hi>French;</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> had been very much diſpleaſed, that the <hi>Indians</hi> had brought me away.</p>
               <p>—23d. The <hi>liar</hi> raiſed a ſtory, as if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were divided into three bodies, to come on this ſide the river. They told us the <hi>Cayugas,</hi> that came with us, had ſaid ſo. We told the <hi>Cayu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gas</hi> of it; on which they called the other <hi>Indians</hi> together; denied that they ever ſaid ſo; and ſaid, they were ſent to this place from the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> to tell them to do their beſt endeavors to ſend the <hi>French</hi> off from this country; and when that was done, they would go and tell the general to go back over the mountains.</p>
               <p>I ſee the <hi>Indians</hi> concern themſelves very much about the affair of land; and are continually jealous, and afraid the <hi>Engliſh</hi> will take their land. I told them to be ſtill and content themſelves, "for there are ſome chiefs of the <hi>Five Nations</hi> with the army; they will ſettle the affair, as they are the chief owners of the land; and it will be well for you to come and ſpeak with the general your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſaac Still</hi> aſked the <hi>French</hi> captain, whether it was true, that <hi>Daniel</hi> had ſold me to the <hi>French?</hi> He owned it, and ſaid, I was theirs, they had bought me fairly; and, if the <hi>Indians</hi> would give them leave, he would take me.</p>
               <p>—24th. We hanged out the <hi>Engliſh</hi> flag, in ſpite of the <hi>French;</hi> on which our priſoners folded their hands, in hopes that their redemption was nigh, looking up to God, which melted my heart in tears, and prayers to God, to hear their prayers, and change the times, and the ſituation, which our priſoners are in, and under which they groan. "O Lord, ſaid they, when will our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion come, that we ſhall be delivered, and return home?"—And if any accident happeneth, which the <hi>Indians</hi> diſlike, the priſoners all tremble with fear, ſaying, "Lord, what will become of us, and what will be the end of our lives?" So that they often wiſh themſelves rather under the ground, than in this life. King Beaver came home, and called us to his houſe, and ſaluted us in a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manner; which we, in like manner, did to him. Afterwards I ſpoke by four ſtrings of 350 wampum, and ſaid, as followeth:</p>
               <p>"I have a ſalutation to you, and all your people, from the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, the governor, and many other gentlemen. Brother, it pleaſes me that the day is come to ſee you and your people. We have warmed ourſelves by your fire, and waited for you, and
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:034421_0484_0FFDA1A0B75CC678"/>
thank you, that you did come home. We have good news of great importance; which we hope will make you, and all your people's hearts glad. By theſe ſtrings I deſire you would be pleaſed to call all your kings and captains, from all the towns and nations; ſo that they all may hear us, and have the benefit thereof, while they live, and their children after them."</p>
               <p>Then he ſaid, "As ſoon as I heard of your coming, I roſe up directly to come to you." Then there came another meſſage, which called me to another place, where ſix kings of ſix nations were met together. I ſent them word, they ſhould ſit together a while, and ſmoke their pipes, and I would come to them. King Beaver ſaid further,</p>
               <p>"Brother, it pleaſeth me to hear that you brought ſuch good news; and my heart rejoices already at what you ſaid to me. It rejoices me that I have now heard of you." I ſaid, "Brother, you did well, that you firſt came here, before you went to the kings; as the good news we brought is to all nations, from the riſing of the ſun to the going down of the ſame; that want to be in peace and friendſhip with the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> So it will give them ſatisfaction, when they hear it." The <hi>French</hi> captain told us, that they would demoliſh the fort; and he thought the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would be to-day at the place.</p>
               <p>—25th <hi>Shingas</hi> came home, and ſaluted us in a friendly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and ſo did <hi>Beaver,</hi> in our houſe; and then they told us, they would hear our meſſage; and we perceived that the <hi>French</hi> captain had an inclination to hear it. We called <hi>Beaver</hi> and <hi>Shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gas,</hi> and informed them, that all the nations, at <hi>Eaſton,</hi> had agreed with the governor, that every thing ſhould be kept ſecret from the ears and eyes of the <hi>French.</hi> He ſaid, "it was no matter, they were beaten already. It is good news, and if he would ſay any thing, we would tell him what friendſhip we have together." Accordingly they met together, and the <hi>French</hi> captain was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. The number conſiſted of about fifty.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Beaver</hi> firſt ſpoke to his men, "Hearken, all you captains and warriors, here are our brethren, the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> I wiſh that you may give attention, and take notice of what they ſay. As it is for our good, that there may an everlaſting peace be eſtabliſhed, although there is a great deal of miſchief done, if it pleaſeth God to help us, we may live in peace again."</p>
               <p>Then I began to ſpeak by four ſtrings to them, and ſaid,</p>
               <p>"Brethren, being come here to ſee you, I perceive your bodies are all ſtained with blood, and obſerve tears and ſorrows in your eyes: With this ſtring I clean your body from blood, and wipe
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:034421_0485_0FFDA1B6D6968438"/>
and anoint your eyes with the healing oil, ſo that you may ſee your brethren clearly. And as ſo many ſtorms have blown ſince we laſt ſaw one another, and we are at ſuch a diſtance from you, that you could not rightly hear us as yet, I, by this ſtring, take a ſoft feather, and with that good oil, our grandfathers uſed, open and clear your ears, ſo that you may both hear and underſtand what your brethren have to ſay to you. And by theſe ſtrings I clear your throat from the duſt, and take all the bitterneſs out of your heart, and clear the paſſage from the heart to the throat, that you may ſpeak freely with your brethren, the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> from the heart."</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Iſaac Still</hi> gave the pipe, ſent by the <hi>Friends</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>Quakers</hi> of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> who firſt ſet on ſoot theſe negociations of peace; and for whom the <hi>Indians</hi> have always had a great regard.</note>, filled with tobacco, and handed round, after their cuſtom, and ſaid:</p>
               <p>"Brethren, here is the pipe, which your grandfathers uſed to ſmoke with, when they met together in councils of peace. And here is ſome of that good tobacco, prepared for our grandfathers from God:—When you ſhall taſte of it, you ſhall feel it through all your body; and it will put you in remembrance of the good councils, your grandfathers uſed to hold with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> your brethren, and that ancient friendſhip, they had together."</p>
               <p>King <hi>Beaver</hi> roſe, and thanked us firſt, that we had cleaned his body from the blood, and wiped the tears and ſorrow from his eyes, and opened his ears, ſo that now he could well hear and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand. Likewiſe he returned thanks for the <hi>pipe and tobacco,</hi> that we brought, which our grandfathers uſed to ſmoke. He ſaid, —"When I taſted that good tobacco, I felt it all through my body, and it made me all over well."</p>
               <p>Then we delivered the meſſages, as followeth:</p>
               <p>Governor <hi>Denny's</hi> anſwer to the meſſage of the <hi>Ohio Indians,</hi> brought by <hi>Frederick Poſt, Peſquitomen</hi> and <hi>Thomas Hickman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>"By this ſtring, my <hi>Indian</hi> brethren of the United Nations and <hi>Delawares,</hi> join with me, in requiring of the <hi>Indian</hi> councils, to which theſe following meſſages ſhall be preſented, to keep every thing private from the eyes and ears of the <hi>French."</hi> A ſtring.</p>
               <p>"Brethren, we received your meſſage by <hi>Peſquitomen</hi> and <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick Poſt,</hi> and thank you for the care you have taken of our meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of peace, and that you have put him in your boſom, and protected him againſt our enemy, <hi>Onontio,</hi> and his children, and ſent him ſafe back to our council fire, by the ſame man, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him from us."

I would open your ears, and clear your eyes from tears, ſo that you may ſee, and hear what your uncles, the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> have to ſay. We have eſtabliſhed a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with your brethren, the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> We ſee that you are all over bloody, on your body; I clean the heart from the duſt, and your eyes from the tears, and your bodies from the blood, that you may hear and ſee your brethren, the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and appear clean before them, and that you may ſpeak from the heart with them."</p>
               <p>Delivered four ſtrings.</p>
               <p>Then he ſhewed to them a ſtring from the <hi>Cherokees,</hi> with theſe words:</p>
               <p>"Nephews, we let you know, that we are exceeding glad that there is ſuch a firm friendſhip eſtabliſhed, on ſo good a foundation, with ſo many nations, that it will laſt for ever; and, as the <hi>Six Nations</hi> have agreed with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſo we wiſh that you may lay hold of the ſame friendſhip. We will remind you, that we were formerly good friends. Likewiſe we let you know, that the <hi>Six Nations</hi> gave us a <hi>tomahawk,</hi> and, if any body offended us, we ſhould ſtrike him with it; likewiſe they gave me a knife, to take off the ſcalp. So we let you know, that we are deſirous to hear very ſoon from you, what you determine. It may be we ſhall uſe the hatchet very ſoon, therefore I long to hear from you."</p>
               <p>Then the council broke up. After a little while meſſengers arrived, and <hi>Beaver</hi> came into our houſe, and gave us the pleaſure to hear, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had the field, and that the <hi>French</hi> had demoliſhed and burnt the place entirely, and went off; that the commander is gone with two hundred men to <hi>Venango,</hi> and the reſt gone down the river in battoes, to the lower <hi>Shawaneſe</hi> town, with an intention to build a fort there; they were ſeen yeſterday paſſing by <hi>Sawcung.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ended this day with pleaſure and great ſatisfaction on both ſides: the <hi>Cayuga</hi> chief ſaid, he would ſpeak further to them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow.</p>
               <p>—26th. We met together about ten o'clock. Firſt, King <hi>Beaver</hi> addreſſed himſelf to the <hi>Cayuga</hi> chief, and ſaid;</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="unknown:034421_0491_0FFDA1CD97A5B9E8"/>"My uncles, as it is cuſtomary to anſwer one another, ſo I thank you, that you took ſo much notice of your couſins, and that you have wiped the tears from our eyes, and cleaned our bodies from the blood; when you ſpoke to me I ſaw myſelf all over bloody; and ſince you cleaned me I feel myſelf quite pleaſant through my whole body, and I can ſee the ſun ſhine clear over us."</p>
               <p>Delivered four ſtrings.</p>
               <p>He ſaid further, "As you took ſo much pains, and came a great way through the buſhes, I, by this ſtring, clean you from the ſweat, and clean the duſt out of your throat, ſo that you may ſpeak what you have to ſay from your brethren, the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and our uncles, the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> to your couſins, I am ready to hear."</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Petiniontonka,</hi> the <hi>Cayuga</hi> chief, took the belt with eight diamonds,<note n="*" place="bottom">Diamond figures, formed by beads of wampum, of different colours.</note> and ſaid;</p>
               <p>"Couſins, take notice of what I have to ſay; we let you know what agreement we have made with our brethren, the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> We had almoſt ſlipt and dropt the chain of friendſhip with our brethren, the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> now we let you know that we have renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the peace and friendſhip with our brethren, the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and we have made a new agreement with them. We ſee that you have dropt the peace and friendſhip with them. We deſire you would lay hold of the covenant, we have made with our brethren, the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and be ſtrong. We likewiſe take the <hi>tomahawk</hi> out of your hands, that you received from the white people; uſe it no longer; fling the <hi>towahawk</hi> away; it is the white people's; let them uſe it among themſelves; it is theirs, and they are of one colour; let them fight with one another, and do you be ſtill and quiet in <hi>Kuſhkuſhking.</hi> Let our grandchildren, the <hi>Shawaneſe,</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe know of the covenant, we eſtabliſhed with our friends, the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and alſo let all other nations know it."</p>
               <p>Then he explained to them the eight diamonds, on the belt, ſignifying the five united nations, and the three younger nations, which join them: theſe all united with the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Then he proceeded thus:</p>
               <p>"Brethren," (delivering a belt with eight diamonds, the ſecond belt) "we hear that you did not ſit right; and when I came I found you in a moving poſture, ready to jump towards the ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet; ſo we will ſet you at eaſe, and quietly down, that you may ſit well at <hi>Kuſhkuſhking;</hi> and we deſire you to be ſtrong; and if you will be ſtrong, your women and children will ſee from day to day the light ſhining more over them; and our children and grand

children will ſee that there will be an everlaſting peace eſtabliſhed. We deſire you to be ſtill; we do not know as yet, what to do; towards the ſpring you ſhall hear from your uncles what they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude; in the mean time do you ſit ſtill by your fire at <hi>Kuſhkuſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the evening the devil made a general diſturbance, to hinder them in their good diſpoſition. It was reported they ſaw three <hi>Catawba Indians</hi> in their town; and they roved about all that cold night, in great fear and confuſion. When I conſider with what tyranny and power the prince of this world rules over this people, it breaks my heart over them; and I wiſh that God would have mercy upon them, and that their redemption may draw nigh, and open their eyes, that they may ſee what bondage they are in, and deliver them from the evil.</p>
               <p>—27th. We waited all the day for an anſwer. <hi>Beaver</hi> came and told us, "They were buſy all the day long," He ſaid, "It is a great matter, and wants much conſideration. We are three tribes, which muſt ſeparately agree among ourſelves; it takes time before we hear each agreement, and the particulars thereof." He deſired us to read our meſſage once more to them in private; we told them, we were at their ſervice at any time; and then we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained him the whole again. There arrived a meſſenger from <hi>Sawcung,</hi> and informd us that four of their people were gone to our camp, to ſee what the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were about; and that one of them climbing upon a tree was diſcovered by falling down; and then our people ſpoke to them; three reſolved to go to the other ſide, and one came back and brought the news, which pleaſed the company. Some of the captains and counſellors were together; they ſaid, that the <hi>French</hi> would build a ſtrong fort, at the lower <hi>Shawaneſe</hi> town. I anſwered them, "Brethren, if you ſuffer the French to build a fort there, you muſt ſuffer likewiſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to come and deſtroy the place; <hi>Engliſh</hi> will follow the <hi>French,</hi> and purſue them, let it coſt whatever it will; and wherever the <hi>French</hi> ſettle, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> will follow and deſtroy them."</p>
               <p>They ſaid, "We think the ſame, and would endeavour to prevent it, if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> only would go back, after having drove away the <hi>French,</hi> and not ſettle there." I ſaid, "I can tell you no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in this affair; it is beſt for you to go with us to the general, and ſpeak with him. So much I know, that they only want to eſtabliſh a trade with you; and you know yourſelves that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do without being ſupplied with ſuch goods as you ſtand in need of; but, brethren, be aſſured you muſt entirely quit the <hi>French,</hi> and have no communication with them, elſe they will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:034421_0493_0FFDA1F7C5F154F0"/>
breed diſturbance and confuſion amongſt you, and perſuade your young people to go to war againſt our brethren, the <hi>Engliſh."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſpoke with them further about <hi>Venango,</hi> and ſaid, "I believed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would go there, if they ſuffered the <hi>French</hi> longer to live there. This ſpeech had much influence on them, and they ſaid; "We are convinced of all that you have ſaid; it will be ſo." I found them inclined to ſend off the <hi>French</hi> from <hi>Venango;</hi> but they wanted firſt to know the diſpoſition of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and not to ſuffer the <hi>French</hi> to build any where.</p>
               <p>—28th. King <hi>Beaver</hi> aroſe early before the break of day, and bid all his people a good morning, deſired them to riſe early and prepare victuals; for they had to anſwer their brethren, the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,</hi> and their uncles, and therefore they ſhould be in a good humour and diſpoſition. At ten o'clock they met together; <hi>Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> addreſſed himſelf to his people, and ſaid,</p>
               <p>"Take notice all you young men and warriors to what we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer now: it is three days ſince we heard our brethren, the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,</hi> and our uncles; and what we have heard of both is very good; and we are all much pleaſed with what we have heard. Our uncles have made an agreement, and peace is eſtabliſhed with our brethren, the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and they have ſhook hands with them; and we likewiſe agree in the peace and friendſhip, they have eſtabliſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them." Then he ſpoke to the <hi>French</hi> captain <hi>Canaquais,</hi> and ſaid,</p>
               <p>"You may hear what I anſwer; it is good news, that we have heard. I have not made myſelf a king. My uncles have made me like a queen, that I always ſhould mind what is good and right, and whatever I agree with, they will aſſiſt me, and help me through. Since the warriors came amongſt us, I could not follow that which is good and right; which has made me heavy; and ſince it is my duty to do that which is good, ſo I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to do and to ſpeak what is good, and not let myſelf be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed by the warriors."</p>
               <p>Then he ſpoke to the <hi>Mingoes,</hi> and ſaid,</p>
               <p>"My uncles, hear me: It is two days ſince you told me, that you have made peace and friendſhip, and ſhook hands with our brethren, the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> I am really very much pleaſed with what you told me; and I join with you in the ſame; and, as you ſaid, I ſhould let the <hi>Shawaneſe</hi> and <hi>Delamattanoes</hi> know of the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you have made with our brethren, the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> I took it to heart, and ſhall let them know it very ſoon."</p>
               <p>He delivered a ſtring.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="unknown:034421_0494_0FFEA8102A9FAEA0"/>"Look now, my uncles, and hear what your couſins ſay: you have ſpoke the day before yeſterday to me. I have heard you. You told me, you would ſet me at <hi>Kuſhkuſhking</hi> eaſy down. I took it to heart; and I ſhall do ſo, and be ſtill, and lay myſelf eaſy down, and keep my match-coat cloſe to my breaſt. You told me, you will let me know in the next ſpring, what to do; ſo I will be ſtill, and wait to hear from you."</p>
               <p>Gave him a belt.</p>
               <p>Then he turned himſelf to us, and gave us the following an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers. Firſt, to the general;</p>
               <p>"Brother, by theſe ſtrings I would deſire, in a moſt kind and friendly manner, you would be pleaſed to hear me what I have to ſay, as you are not far off.</p>
               <p>"Brother, now you told me you have heard of that good agreement, that has been agreed to, at the treaty at <hi>Eaſton;</hi> and that you have put your hands to it, to ſtrengthen it, ſo that it may laſt for ever. Brother, you have told me, that after you have come to hear it, you have taken it to heart, and then you ſent it to me, and let me know it. Brother, I would deſire you would be pleaſed to hear me, and I would tell you, in a moſt ſoft, lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and friendly manner, to go back over the mountain, and to ſtay there; for, if you will do that, I will uſe it for an argument, to argue with other nations of <hi>Indians.</hi> Now, brother, you have told me you have made a road clear, from the ſun-ſet to our firſt old council fire, at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and therefore I ſhould fear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and come into that road. Brother, after theſe far <hi>Indians</hi> ſhall come to hear of that good and wide road, that you have laid out for us, then they will turn and look at the road, and ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the way; and that is the reaſon, that maketh me tell you to go back over the mountain again, and to ſtay there; for then the road will be clear, and nothing in the way."</p>
               <p>Then he addreſſed himſelf to the Governor of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> as follows;</p>
               <p>"Brother, give good attention to what I am going to ſay; for I ſpeak from my heart; and think nothing the loſs of it, though the ſtrings be ſmall.<note n="*" place="bottom">Important matters ſhould be accompanied with large ſtrings, or bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"Brother, I now tell you what I have heard from you is quite agreeable to my mind; and I love to hear you. I tell you likewiſe, that all the chief men of <hi>Allegheny</hi> are well pleaſed with what you have ſaid to us; and all my young men, women and children, that

               <p>"Brother, you tell me that all the Governors of the ſeveral provinces have agreed to a well eſtabliſhed and everlaſting peace with the <hi>Indians;</hi> and you likewiſe tell me, that my uncles, the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> and my brethren, the <hi>Dalawares,</hi> and ſeveral other tribes of <hi>Indians</hi> join with you in it, to eſtabliſh it, ſo that it may be everlaſting; you likewiſe tell me, you have all agreed on a treaty of peace to laſt for ever; and for theſe reaſons I tell you, I am pleaſed with what you have told me.</p>
               <p>"Brother, I am heartily pleaſed to hear that you never let ſlip the chain of friendſhip out of your hands, which our grandfathers had between them, ſo that they could agree as brethren and friends in any thing.</p>
               <p>"Brother, as you have been pleaſed to let me know of that good and deſirable agreement, that you and my uncles and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren have agreed to, at the treaty of peace, I now tell you I heartily join and agree in it, and to it; and now I deſire you to go on ſteadily in that great and good work, you have taken in hand; and I will do as you deſire me to do; that is, to let the other tribes of <hi>Indians</hi> know it, and more eſpecially my uncles, the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> and the <hi>Shawaneſe,</hi> my grandchildren, and all other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſettled to the weſtward.</p>
               <p>"Brother, I deſire you not to be out of patience, as I have a great many friends at a great diſtance; and I ſhall uſe my beſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to let them know it as ſoon as poſſible; and as ſoon as I obtain their anſwer, ſhall let you know it."</p>
               <p>Then he gave ſix ſtrings all white.</p>
               <p>In the evening arrived a meſſenger from <hi>Sackung, Netodwehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and deſired they ſhould make all the haſte to diſpatch us, and we ſhould come to <hi>Sackung;</hi> for, as they did not know what is become of thoſe three, that went to our camp, they were afraid the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would keep them, till they heard what was become of us, their meſſengers.</p>
               <p>—29th. Before day break <hi>Beaver</hi> and <hi>Shingas</hi> came, and called us into their council. They had been all the night together. They ſaid; "Brethren, now is the day coming, you will ſet off from here. It is a good many days ſince we heard you; and what we have heard is very pleaſing and agreeable to us. It rejoices all our hearts; and all our young men, women and children, that are capable to underſtand, are really very well pleaſed with what they have heard; it is ſo agreeable to us, that we never received ſuch good news before; we think God had made it ſo; he pities us,

and has mercy on us. And now, brethren, you deſire that I ſhould let it be known to all other nations; and I ſhall let them know very ſoon. Therefore <hi>Shingas</hi> cannot go with you. He muſt go with me, to help me in this great work; and I ſhall ſend nobody, but go myſelf, to make it known to all nations."</p>
               <p>Then we thanked them for their care; and wiſhed him good ſucceſs on his journey and undertaking: and, as this meſſage had ſuch a good effect on them, we hoped it would have the ſame on all other nations, when they came to hear it. I hoped that all the clouds would paſs away, and the chearful light would ſhine over all nations: ſo I wiſhed them good aſſiſtance and help on their journey. Farther, he ſaid to us;</p>
               <p>"Now we deſire you to be ſtrong;<note n="*" place="bottom">The word, <hi>wiſhickſey,</hi> tranſlated, <hi>be ſtrong,</hi> is of a very extenſive ſignification be ſtrong, be ſteady, purſue to effect what you hare begun, &amp;c.</note> becauſe I ſhall make it my ſtrong argument with other nations; but as we have given cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to what you have ſaid, hoping it is true, and we agree to it; if it ſhould prove the contrary, it would make me ſo aſhamed, that I never could lift up my head, and never undertake to ſpeak any word more for the intereſt of the <hi>Engliſh."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I told them, "Brethren, you will remember that it was wrote to you by the general, that you might give credit to what we ſay; ſo I am glad to hear of you, that you give credit; and we aſſure you, that what we have told you is the truth; and you will find it ſo."</p>
               <p>They ſaid further, "Brethren, we let you know, that the <hi>French</hi> have uſed our people kindly, in every reſpect; they have uſed them like gentlemen, eſpecially thoſe that live near them. So they have treated the chiefs.

               <p>I told them, "I would take it to heart, and inform the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, and other gentlemen of it; and ſpeak to them in their favour." Then they ſaid, "It is ſo far well, and the road is cleared; but they thought we ſhould ſend them another call, when they may come." I told them; "We did not know when they would have agreed with the other nations. Brother, it is you, who muſt give

And if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would draw back over the mountain, they would get all the other nations into their intereſt; but if they ſtaid and ſettled there, all the nations would be againſt them; and he was afraid it would be a great war, and never come to a peace again."</p>
               <p>I promiſed to inform the Governor, General, and all other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of it, and repeated my former requeſt to them, not to ſuffer any <hi>French</hi> to ſettle amongſt them. After we had fetched our horſes, we went from <hi>Kuſhkuſhking,</hi> and came at five o'clock to <hi>Sac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cung,</hi> in company with twenty <hi>Indians.</hi> When we came about half way, we met a meſſenger from fort <hi>Duqueſne,</hi> with a belt from <hi>Thomas King,</hi> inviting all the chiefs to <hi>Saccung.</hi> We heard at the ſame time, that Mr. <hi>Croghn</hi> and <hi>Henry Montour</hi> would be there to day. The meſſenger was one of thoſe three, that went to our camp; and it ſeemed to rejoice all the company; for ſome of them were much troubled in their minds, fearing that the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> had kept them, as priſoners, or killed them. In the evening we arrived at <hi>Saccung,</hi> on the <hi>Beaver</hi> creek. We were well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. The king provided for us. After a little while we viſited Mr. <hi>Croghn</hi> and his company.</p>
               <p>—30th. In the morning the <hi>Indians</hi> of the town viſited us. About eleven o'clock about forty came together; when we read the meſſage to them; Mr. <hi>Croghn, Henry Montour</hi> and <hi>Thomas King</hi> being preſent. They were all well pleaſed with the meſſage. In the evening we came together with the chiefs, and explained the ſignification of the belts; which laſted till eleven o'clock at night.</p>

                  </gap>though the <hi>French</hi> have done all, in their power, to prejudice our young men againſt the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Since you now come the ſecond time, we think it is God's work; he pities us, that we ſhould not all die; and if we ſhould not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the peace offered to us, we think God would forſake us."</p>
               <p>In diſcourſe, they ſpoke about preaching, and ſaid, "They wiſhed many times to hear the word of God; but they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways afraid the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would take that opportunity to bring them into bondage." They invited me to come and live amongſt them; ſince I had taken ſo much pains in bringing a peace about between them and the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> I told them, "It might be, that when the peace was firmly eſtabliſhed, I would come to proclaim the peace and love of God to them."</p>
               <p>In the evening arrived a meſſage, with a ſtring of wampum, to a noted <hi>Indian, Ketiuſcund,</hi> to come to <hi>Wenango,</hi> to meet the <hi>Una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi</hi> chief, <hi>Quitahicung</hi> there; he ſaid that a <hi>French Mohock</hi> had kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>Delaware Indian;</hi> and when he was aſked why he did it? He ſaid the <hi>French</hi> bid him do it.</p>
               <p>—2d. Early before we ſet out, I gave 300 wampums to the <hi>Cayugas,</hi> to buy ſome corn for their horſes; they agreed that I ſhould go before to the general, to acquaint him of their coming, The <hi>Beaver</hi> creek being very high, it was almoſt two o'clock, in the afternoon, before we came over the creek; this land ſeems to be very rich. I, with my companion, <hi>Kekiuſcund</hi>'s ſon, came to Log's-town, ſituated on a hill. On the eaſt end is a great piece of low land, where the old <hi>Logs-town</hi> uſed to ſtand. In the new <hi>Logs-town</hi> the <hi>French</hi> have built about thirty houſes for the <hi>Indians.</hi> They have a large corn field on the ſouth ſide, where the corn ſtands ungathered. Then we went farther through a large tract of fine land, along the river ſide. We came within eight miles of <hi>Pittſburg,</hi> where we lodged on a hill, in the open air. It was a cold night; and I had forgot my blanket, being packed upon Mr. Hays's horſe. Between <hi>Saccung</hi> and <hi>Pittſburg,</hi> all the <hi>Shawanos</hi> towns are empty of people.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="unknown:034421_0499_0FFDA25350A54AA0"/>—3d. We ſtarted early, and came to the river by <hi>Pittſburg;</hi> we called that they ſhould come over and fetch us; but their boats having gone adrift, they made a raft of black oak palliſadoes, which ſunk as ſoon as it came into the water. We were very hungry, and ſtaid on that iſland, where I had kept council with the <hi>Indians,</hi> in the month of Auguſt laſt; for all I had nothing to live on, I thought myſelf a great deal better off now, than at that time, having now liberty to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>alk upon the iſland according to pleaſure; and it ſeemed as if the dark clouds were diſperſed.</p>
               <p>While I waited here, I ſaw the general march off from <hi>Pittſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg;</hi> which made me ſorry, that I could not have the pleaſure of ſpeaking with him. Towards evening our whole party arrived: upon which they fired from the fort with twelve great guns; and our <hi>Indians</hi> ſaluted again three times round with their ſmall arms. By accident ſome of the <hi>Indians</hi> found a raft hid in the buſhes, and Mr. Hays, coming laſt, went over firſt with two Indians. They ſent us but a ſmall allowance; ſo that it would not ſerve each round. I tied my belt a little cloſer, being very hungry, and nothing to eat.<note n="*" place="bottom">As it often happens to the <hi>Indians,</hi> on their long marches, in war, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in their hunting expeditions, to be without victuals for ſeveral days, occaſioned by bad weather and other accidents, they have this cuſtom in ſuch caſes; which <hi>Poſt</hi> probably learned of them, viz. girding their bellies tight, when they have nothing to put in them; and they ſay it preſents the pain of hunger.</note> It ſnowed, and we were obliged to ſleep without any ſhelter. In the evening they threw light balls from the fort; at which the <hi>Indians</hi> ſtarted, thinking they would fire at them; but ſeeing it was not aimed at them, they rejoiced to ſee them fly ſo high.</p>
               <p>—4th. We got up early, and cleared a place from the ſnow, cut ſome fire wood, and hallooed till we were tired. Towards noon Mr. <hi>Hays</hi> came with a raft, and the <hi>Indian</hi> chiefs went over: he informed me of Colonel <hi>Bouquet</hi>'s diſpleaſure with the <hi>Indians</hi> anſwer to the general, and his deſire that they ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their mind, in inſiſting upon the general's going back; but the <hi>Indians</hi> had no inclination to alter their mind. In the afternoon ſome proviſion was ſent over, but a ſmall allowance. When I came over to the fort, the council with the <hi>Indians</hi> was almoſt at an end. I had a diſcourſe with Colonel <hi>Bouquet</hi> about the affairs, diſpoſition and reſolution of the <hi>Indians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I drew proviſion for our journey to fort <hi>Ligonier,</hi> and baked bread for our whole company: towards noon the <hi>Indians</hi> met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a conference. Firſt king <hi>Beaver</hi> addreſſed himſelf to the <hi>Mohocks,</hi> deſiring them to give their brethren an anſwer about
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:034421_0500_0FFDA23565B51768"/>
ſettling at <hi>Pittſburg.</hi> The <hi>Mohocks</hi> ſaid, "They lived at ſuch a diſtance, that they could not defend the <hi>Engliſh</hi> there, if any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident ſhould befal them; but you, couſins, who live cloſe here, muſt think what to do." Then <hi>Beaver</hi> ſaid by a ſtring:</p>
               <p>"What this meſſenger has brought is very agreeable to us; and as our uncles have made peace with you, the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and many other nations, ſo we likewiſe join, and accept of the peace offered to us; and we have already anſwered by your meſſenger, what we have to ſay to the general, that he ſhould go back over the mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ains; we have nothing to ſay to the contrary."</p>
               <p>Neither Mr. <hi>Croghn</hi> nor <hi>Andrew Montour</hi> would tell Colonel <hi>Bouquet</hi> the <hi>Indians'</hi> anſwer. Then Mr. <hi>Croghn,</hi> Colonel <hi>Armſtrong</hi> and Colonel <hi>Bouquet</hi> went into the tent by themſelves, and I went upon my buſineſs. What they have further agreed I do not know; but when they had done, I called king <hi>Beaver, Shingas,</hi> and <hi>Kekeuſcund,</hi> and ſaid,</p>
               <p>"Brethren, if you have any alteration to make, in the anſwer to the general, concerning leaving this place, you will be pleaſed to let me know." They ſaid, they would alter nothing, "We have told them three times to leave the place and go back; but they inſiſt upon ſtaying here; if, therefore, they will be deſtroyed by the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Indians,</hi> we cannot help them."</p>
               <p>Colonel <hi>Bouquet</hi> ſet out for <hi>Loyalhannon:</hi> The <hi>Indians</hi> got ſome liquor between ten and eleven o'clock. One <hi>Mohock</hi> died; the others fired guns three times over him; at the laſt firing one had accidentally loaded his gun with a double charge: this gun burſt to pieces, and broke his hand clean off; he alſo got a hard knock on his breaſt; and in the morning at nine o'clock he died, and they buried them in that place, both in one hole.</p>
               <p>—6th. It was a cold morning; we ſwam our horſes over the river, the ice running violently. Mr. <hi>Croghn</hi> told me that the <hi>Indians</hi> had ſpoke, upon the ſame ſtring that I had, to Colonel <hi>Bouquet,</hi> and altered their mind; and had agreed and deſired that 200 men ſhould ſtay at the fort. I refuſed to make any alteration in the anſwer to the general, till I myſelf did hear it of the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> at which Mr. <hi>Croghn</hi> grew very angry. I told him I had already ſpoke with the <hi>Indians;</hi> he ſaid, it was a d—d lie; and deſired Mr. <hi>Hays</hi> to enquire of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and take down in writing what they ſaid. Accordingly he called them, and aſked them, if they had altered their ſpeech, or ſpoke to Colonel <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet</hi> on that ſtring they gave me. <hi>Shingas</hi> and the other counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor ſaid, they had ſpoken nothing to Colonel <hi>Bouquet</hi> on the ſtring
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:034421_0501_0FFDA268F268B578"/>
they gave me, but what was agreed between the Indians at <hi>Kuſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kuſhking.</hi> They ſaid, Mr. <hi>Croghn</hi> and <hi>Henry Montour</hi> had not ſpoke and acted honeſtly and uprightly; they bid us not alter the leaſt, and ſaid, "We have told them three times to go back; but they will not go, inſiſting upon ſtaying here. Now you will let the governor, general, and all people know, that our deſire is, that they ſhould go back, till the other nations have joined in the peace, and then they may come and build a trading houſe."</p>
               <p>They then repeated what they had ſaid the 5th inſtant. Then we took leave of them, and promiſed to inform the general, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, and all other gentle people of their diſpoſition; and ſo we ſet out from <hi>Pittſburg,</hi> and came within fifteen miles of the breaſt-work; where we encamped. It ſnowed, and we made a little cabbin of hides.</p>
               <p>—7th. Our horſes were fainting, having little or no food. We came that day about twenty miles, to another breaſt-work; where the whole army had encamped on a hill; the water being far to fetch.</p>
               <p>—8th. Between <hi>Pittſburg</hi> and fort <hi>Ligonier</hi> the country is hilly, with rich bottoms, well timbered, but ſcantily watered. We arrived at fort <hi>Ligonier</hi> in the afternoon, about four o'clock; where we found the general very ſick; and therefore could have no opportunity to ſpeak with him.</p>
               <p>—9th. We waited to ſee the general; they told us he would march the next day, and we ſhould go with him. Captain <hi>Sinclair</hi> wrote us a return for proviſions for four days.</p>
               <p>—10th. The general was ſtill ſick; ſo that he could not go on the journey.</p>
               <p>—11th. We longed very much to go farther; and therefore ſpoke to Major <hi>Halket,</hi> and deſired him to enquire of the general, if he intended to ſpeak with us, or, if we might go; as we were in a poor condition, for want of linen, and other neceſſaries. He deſired us to bring the <hi>Indians'</hi> anſwer, and our journal to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. Mr. <hi>Hays</hi> read his journal to Major <hi>Halket</hi> and Governor <hi>Glen.</hi> They took memorandums, and went to the general.</p>
               <p>—12th. They told us we ſhould ſtay till the general went.</p>
               <p>—14th. The general intended to go; but his horſes could not be found. They thought the <hi>Indians</hi> had carried them off. They hunted all day for the horſes, but could not find them. I ſpoke to Colonel <hi>Bouquet</hi> about our allowance being ſo ſmall, that we could hardly ſubſiſt; and that we were without money; and
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:034421_0502_0FFDA25187C935B8"/>
deſired him to let us have ſome money, that we might buy neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries. Proviſions, and every thing is exceeding dear. One pound of bread coſt a ſhilling; one pound of ſugar four ſhillings, a quart of rum ſeven ſhillings and ſix pence, and ſo in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Colonel <hi>Bouquet</hi> laid our matters before the general; who let me call, and excuſed himſelf, that his diſtemper had hindered him from ſpeaking with me; and promiſed to help me in every thing I ſhould want, and ordered him to give me ſome money. He ſaid farther, that I often ſhould call; and when he was alone he would ſpeak with me.</p>
               <p>—16th. Mr. <hi>Hays,</hi> being a hunting, was ſo lucky as to find the general's horſes, and brought them home; for which the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral was very thankful to him.</p>
               <p>—17th. Mr. <hi>Hays,</hi> being deſired by Major <hi>Halket</hi> to go and look for the other horſes, went, but found none.</p>
               <p>—18th. The general told me to hold myſelf ready, to go with him down the country.</p>
               <p>—20th. After we had been out two days, to hunt for our horſes, in the rain, we went again to day, and were informed, they had been ſeen in a loſt condition; one laying on the hill, and the other ſtanding; they had been hoppled together; but a perſon told us, he had cut the hopples. When we came home we found the horſes; they having made home to the fort.</p>
               <p>—22d. It was cold and ſtormy weather.</p>
               <p>—23d. I hunted for our horſes, and having found them, we gave them both to the king's commiſſary; they not being able to carry us farther.</p>
               <p>The ſerjeant <hi>Henry Oſten,</hi> being one of the company that guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, as above mentioned, and was that ſame priſoner, whom the <hi>Shavanos</hi> intended to burn alive, came to day to the fort. He was much rejoiced to ſee us, and ſaid, "I thank you a thouſand times for my deliverance from the fire; and think it not too much to be at your ſervice my whole life time." He gave us intelligence that the <hi>Indians</hi> were, as yet, mightily for the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> His maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had offered to ſet him at liberty, and bring him to <hi>Pittſburg</hi> if he would promiſe him ten gallons of rum; which he did; and he was brought ſafe to <hi>Pittſburg. Delaware George</hi> is ſtill faithful to the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and was very helpful to procure his liberty. <hi>Iſaac Still, Shingas</hi> and <hi>Beaver</hi> are gone with the meſſage to the nations living further off. When the <hi>French</hi> had heard that the garriſon, at <hi>Pittſburg,</hi> conſiſted only of 200 men, they reſolved to go down
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:034421_0503_0FFDA23DD7021F18"/>
from <hi>Venango,</hi> and deſtroy the <hi>Engliſh</hi> fort. So ſoon as the <hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>Kuſhkuſhking,</hi> heard of their intention, they ſent a meſſage to the <hi>French,</hi> deſiring them to draw back; for they would have no war in their country. The friendly <hi>Indians</hi> have ſent out parties with that intention, that if the <hi>French</hi> went on, in their march towards the fort, they would catch them, and bring them to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> They ſhewed to <hi>Oſten</hi> the place, where eight <hi>French In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> ſpies had lain near the fort. By their marks upon the place they learned that theſe eight were gone back, and five more were to come to the ſame place again. He told us further, that the <hi>Indians</hi> had ſpoke among themſelves, that if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would join them, they would go to <hi>Venango,</hi> and deſtroy the <hi>French</hi> there. We hear that the friendly <hi>Indians</hi> intend to hunt round the fort, at <hi>Pittſburg,</hi> and bring the garriſon freſh meat. And upon this intelligence the general ſent Captain <hi>Wedderholz</hi> with fifty men, to reinforce the garriſon at <hi>Pittſburg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>—25th. The people in the camp prepared for a <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> frolick; but I kept <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> in the woods by myſelf.</p>
               <p>—26th. To day an expreſs came from <hi>Pittſburg</hi> to inform the general, that the French had called all the <hi>Indians</hi> in their intereſt together, and intended to come and deſtroy them there.</p>
               <p>—27th. Towards noon the general ſet out; which cauſed a great joy among the garriſon, which had hitherto lain in tents, but now being a ſmaller company, could be more comfortably lodged. It ſnowed the whole day. We encamped by a <hi>beaver dam,</hi> under <hi>Laurel Hill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>—28th. We came to <hi>Stony Creek,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Quichſell</hi> is ſtationed. The general ſent Mr. <hi>Hays,</hi> expreſs, to fort <hi>Bedford (Rays Town)</hi> and commanded him to ſee, if the place for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campment, under the <hi>Allegheny</hi> mountain, was prepared; as alſo to take care that refreſhments ſhould be at hand, at his coming. It was ſtormy and ſnowed all the day.</p>
               <p>—29th. On the road I came up with ſome waggons; and found my horſes with the company; who had taken my horſe up, and intended to carry the ſame away. We encamped on this ſide, under the <hi>Allegheny</hi> hill.</p>
               <p>—30th. Very early I hunted for my horſes, but in vain, and therefore was obliged to carry my ſaddle bags, and other baggage on my back. The burden was heavy, the roads bad; which made me very tired, and came late to <hi>Bedford;</hi> where I took my old lodging with Mr. <hi>Frazier.</hi> They received me kindly, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed me according to their ability.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="unknown:034421_0504_0FFDA24708E8C6E8"/>—31ſt. This day we reſted, and, contrary to expectation, preparation was made for moving further to-morrow. Mr. <hi>Hays,</hi> who has his lodging with the commander of that place, viſited me:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>January</hi> 1ſt. 1759. We ſet out early. I got my ſaddle bags upon a waggon; but my bed and covering I carried upon my back; and came that day to the croſſing of <hi>Juniata;</hi> where I had poor lodgings, being obliged to ſleep in the open air, the night being very cold.</p>
               <p>—2d. We ſet out early. I wondered very much that the horſes, in theſe ſlippery roads, came ſo well with the waggons over theſe ſteep hills. We came to fort <hi>Littleton;</hi> where I drew proviſions; but could not find any who had bread, to exchange for flour. I took lodging in a common houſe. Mr. <hi>Hays</hi> arrived late.</p>
               <p>—3d. We roſe early. I thought to travel the neareſt road to <hi>Shippen</hi>'s <hi>Town,</hi> and therefore deſired leave of the general to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute my journey to <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and wait for his excellency there; but he deſired me to follow in his company. It ſnowed, freezed, rained, and was ſtormy the whole day. All were exceeding glad that the general arrived ſafe at fort <hi>Loudon.</hi> There was no room in the fort for ſuch a great company; I, therefore, and ſome others went two miles further, and got lodgings at a plantation.</p>
               <p>—4th. I and my company took the upper road; which is three miles nearer to <hi>Shippen</hi>'s <hi>town,</hi> where we arrived this even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The ſlippery roads made me, as a traveller, very tired.</p>
               <p>—5th. To day I ſtaid here for the general. Mr. <hi>Hays</hi> went ten miles further, to ſee ſome of his relations. In the afternoon <hi>Iſrael Pemberton</hi> came from <hi>Philadelphia</hi> to wait upon the general.</p>
               <p>—6th. I came to-day ten miles to Mr. <hi>Miller</hi>'s, where I lodged, having no comfortable place in <hi>Shippen</hi>'s <hi>town;</hi> all the houſes being crowded with people.</p>
               <p>—7th. They made preparation, at Mr. <hi>Millers,</hi> for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the general; but he, being ſo well to-day, reſolved to go as far as <hi>Carliſle.</hi> I could ſcarce find any lodging there. <hi>Henry Montour</hi> was ſo kind as to take me in his room.</p>
               <p>—8th. I begged the general for leave to go to <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome buſineſs, which he at laſt granted. I went to captain Sinclair for a horſe, who ordered me to go to the chief juſtice of the town; who ought to procure one for me, in the province ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. According to this order I went; but the juſtice told me, that he did not know how to get any horſe; if I would go and look for one, he ſhould be glad if I found any. But having no

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> I had done before: and ſo travelled along, and came about ten miles that day to a tavern keeper's, named <hi>Cheſnut.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>—9th. To-day I croſſed the <hi>Suſquahanna</hi> over the ice, and came within thirteen miles of <hi>Lancaſter.</hi> It was ſlippery and heavy travelling.</p>
               <p>—10th. It rained all the day. I arrived at three o'clock, in the afternoon, in <hi>Lancaſter;</hi> and was quite refreſhed, to have the favour to ſee my brethren.</p>
