            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is an evidence of the degeneracy o human nature, that perſons of narrow minds and diviſive practices, are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded by any; but in the judgment of our Lord, the <hi>Peacemakers</hi> are bleſſed, for they ſhall be called the children of GOD.</p>
            <p>IN theſe words are two parts, firſt, a <hi>duty</hi> enjoin'd, <hi>peacemaking,</hi> and ſecond, <hi>arguments</hi> to inforce it annexed. viz. the <hi>bleſſing</hi> of CHRIST, and <hi>being called</hi> the <hi>children</hi> of GOD. Theſe parts of the text, I purpoſe to explain and improve.</p>
            <p n="1">I. THE <hi>peace</hi> here intended is that between man and man, as appears from the 23. and 24. verſes of this chapter, where the phraſe is explained in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing manner, <hi>therefore if thou bring thy gift to the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and there remebreſt that thy brother hath ought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, leave there thy gift, firſt be reconcil'd to thy
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:010181_0003_0F7D43388595A060"/>brother, and then come and offer thy gift;</hi> the expreſſion being indefinite, doubtleſs extends to all the connections of mankind, in families, church and ſtate; <hi>peacemakers</hi> therefore are ſuch who are themſelves quiet and peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, who ſincerely love peace and earneſtly endeavour in obedience to GOD, and regard to man to promote it, wherever their influence reaches, thro' the general ſeries of their behaviour, by the uſe of all lawful means.</p>
            <p>SUCH as duly conſider the value of peace to ſociety, muſt needs have a high eſteem of it, which naturally tends to excite proportional deſire and labour; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out divine influence, we neither have an affecting view of things, or an ability to act with right principles and deſigns: a few peaceable moods and kind offices cannot conſtitute a Peacemaker, for this includes the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing temper of the ſoul and general courſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, theſe and nothing tranſient, evidence the ſtate of the mind, and determine the character.</p>
            <p>THE extent of this duty is univerſal, <hi>if it be poſſible,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men;</hi> not only with ſuch as are of our profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and ſentiments, but with all others that retain the human ſpecies, and if, thro' their default, our labours for peace prove abortive, nevertheleſs we ſhall not miſs a gracious reward, which is not connected with the ſucceſs (that is out of our power) but with our diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and endeavour.<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſaiah. lxix. 4.5.</note> Yet when theſe are crown'd with ſucceſs, it is a tree of life!<note n="†" place="bottom">Prov. xiii. 12.</note>
            </p>
            <p>BUT tho' we are earneſtly to proſecute peace, yet not ſo far as to barter truth and holineſs to obtain it, no! <hi>we muſt buy the truth and not ſell it,</hi> we muſt <hi>follow peace with all men,</hi> and <hi>holineſs;</hi> that is ſo far as is conſiſtent
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:010181_0004_0F7D433942DD90F8"/>with holineſs, and no farther; we ſhould rather die then deny the leaſt truth, but there is a wide diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between our love to it and our impoſing of it as a term of communion upon others; the former is our duty, and the latter our ſin.<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. xiv. 1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>IT muſt be confeſs'd it is no eaſy matter to procure or preſerve peace among mankind, for by our fatal apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy we have loſt that pure light, ſupream love to GOD, and ſincere regard to man, which we enjoy'd in our primitive ſtate; and in place thereof are under the governing power of darkneſs, enmity againſt GOD and man, and immoderate ſelf love: ſo that we neither know our duty in a right manner, or are willing to do it, but have a ſtrong proneneſs to the contrary: nothing leſs than ſupernatural light and almighty power can ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due theſe evils in us, and qualify us to perform accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably the duty enjoyn'd in our text. Yea even after a change is wrought what infants are many in grace, <hi>they are carnal and walk as men, while there is envying, ſtrife, and diviſions among them, while one ſaith he is of Paul and another he is of Apollos; who is Paul and who is Apollos?</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Cor. iii. 3.4.5.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>means</hi> tending to <hi>peace</hi> are either negative or poſitive, of the firſt kind are theſe following, viz. raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judging, unſcriptural terms of communion, and uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable diviſions; and</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. WE ſhould with great care avoid <hi>raſhjudging,</hi> which, on inſufficient grounds, condemns the ſtates and actions of others: this practice is as ſinful in itſelf as unfriendly to the peace of ſociety, and therefore is ſtrictly prohibited and ſeverely cenſur'd by God himſelf, as an invaſion of his province, a deſpiſing of our brother,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:010181_0005_0F7D433986983B80"/>and an anticipation of the general judgment; <hi>who art thou that judgeſt another man's ſervant? why doſt thou ſet at nought thy brother? for we ſhall all ſtand before the judgment ſeat of</hi> CHRIST; <hi>he that judgeth his brother, judgeth the law;</hi> i. e. accuſeth it of imperfection by condemning perſons not for violating its precepts but his own additions; <hi>judge not</hi> ſays our LORD <hi>leſt ye be judged;</hi> i. e. leſt ye provoke others to recriminate and load you with invective; he may certainly expect to be judged without mercy who hath ſhewed no mercy; the moſt unſullied innocence, the moſt eminent and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous goodneſs, are not ſecure from the cenſure of this malignant impiety, which preſumes to aſcribe a ſeries of of good actions, without the leaſt ſhadow of reaſon, to a bad cauſe and deſign; thus the invidious <hi>Phariſees</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed the miraculous works of our LORD to the power of the Devil, and repreſented the Saviour of ſinners not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all his beneficent actions, as a rebel againſt the ſtate.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. IN order to procure and preſerve peace, the <hi>offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers</hi> of <hi>churches</hi> ſhould beware of <hi>adding</hi> on any pretext whatſoever, <hi>new terms of communion</hi> of their own devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, to thoſe which the head of the church has fixed; for hereby his authority will be confronted and the church torn into innumerable parts, we have but <hi>one Lawgiver who is able to ſave and to deſtroy.</hi> It is the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs and duty of church officers, to explain and obey the laws he has given, but they ſhould not ſtep into the legiſlator's chair. Now that the <hi>terms</hi> of <hi>ſtated communion</hi> appointed by our LORD, are <hi>eſſentials</hi> in doctrine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and diſcipline, together with a regular life, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as I conceive, from the following places of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, duly conſidered and compared, i. e. the 14 chapter of the Epiſtle of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans</hi> throughout, is full to this purpoſe; here we are enjoyn'd to <hi>receive the weak,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010181_0006_0F7D433A368317E8"/>but not to doubtful diſputations,</hi> and to <hi>avoid judging and diſpiſing them.</hi> Now by the <hi>weak,</hi> it is plain from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the context, that the Apoſtle means ſuch perſons who tho' ſound in the main points of faith, and ſerious, hold ſome circumſtantial or leſſer errors, viz. that under the goſpel all are obliged to abſtain from meats for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by the Jewiſh law, and to keep their ceremonial Sabbaths: theſe the ſtrong or more orthodox part of the church, are nevertheleſs obliged to receive to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; this precept is inforced by divers arguments, ſuch as that they were ſincere, and <hi>accepted of</hi> GOD, and that the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of <hi>religion</hi> did not conſiſt in theſe things, but in <hi>peace, righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>joy in the Holy Ghoſt; he that in theſe things ſerveth</hi> CHRIST, ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>is acceptable to</hi> GOD, <hi>and approved of men: let us therefore follow after the things that make for peace, and things whereby we may edify one another; for meats deſtroy not the work of</hi> GOD; i. e. do not break the peace of the church, and mar thy brother's edification, by uncharitable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions and diviſions about ſmall and circumſtantial matters; <hi>if you have faith,</hi> about theſe things, <hi>have it to yourſelves,</hi> dont impoſe your ſentiments upon others, <hi>let every man be fully perſuaded in his own mind.</hi> Rom. xv. 1.7. <hi>we then that are ſtrong, ought to bear the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the weak, and not pleaſe ourſelves; wherefore receive one another as</hi> CHRIST <hi>alſo received us to the glory of</hi> GOD. <q>By the <hi>infirmities</hi> of the <hi>weak,</hi> we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand their ignorance, frowardneſs, and cenſoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he ſpeaks not of hereſies and manifeſt enormities but of ſuch errors in doctrine and life, which proceed from ignorance and common infirmity; with theſe we ſhould bear, as we do with ſick perſons in their way-wardneſs; <note n="*" place="bottom">Vid.

            <p n="2">2d. PERSECUTION is contrary to REASON, ſeeing <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is a reaſonable ſervice;</hi> (Romans xii. 1.) founded on argument, a matter of choice: (Joſhua xxiv. 15. Pſalm cx. 3.) proceeding from <hi>love</hi> as its <hi>principle</hi> (2 Corinthians v. 14. Galatians v. 6.) enjoining and recommending <hi>love</hi> by its <hi>precepts</hi> and <hi>examples,</hi> (Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:010181_0020_0F7D43492FDBADB0"/>v. 1.2.) and directed to <hi>love</hi> as its ſcope: (1 Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy i. 5.) Seeing <hi>love, that works no ill to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, is the fulfilling of the law,</hi> (Romans xiii. 10.) <hi>the bond of perfectneſs,</hi> (Colloſians iii. 14.) <hi>greater than faith and hope,</hi> (1 Corinthians xiii. 13.) The uſe of external FORCE, inſtead of befriending this RELIGION, really oppoſes its <hi>principles, ſpirit,</hi> and <hi>end,</hi> by manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing murderous <hi>hatred</hi> againſt our <hi>brother;</hi> (1 John iii. 15.) it excites them to hate us in return, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trays the want of proper arguments to engage our eſteem and affection. In this manner PERSECUTION diſgraces the religion of JESUS, and tends to deſtroy it entirely. As love is the incentive to love, ſo is ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to its contrary; both which actions ſpeak with the loudeſt voice, and give the ſtrongeſt evidence; <hi>the wiſdom that is from above is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle, and eaſy to be entreated; full of mercy.</hi> (James iii. 17.) <hi>but if ye have bitter envying, and ſtrife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not againſt the truth; this wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom deſcendeth not from above, but is earthly, ſenſual, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh;</hi> (James iii. 14.15.) certainly, <hi>the wrath of man, worketh not the righteouſneſs of God.</hi> (James i. 20.21.) Seeing we muſt anſwer to Jehovah for our conduct, and others cannot ſcreen us from his reſentment, is it not rational that we ſhould <hi>examine</hi> and <hi>judge</hi> for our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and <hi>call no man father on the earth,</hi> in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect? and do not the ſacred Scriptures enjoin theſe things upon us? (John v. 39. 1 Corinthians x. 15. Matthew xxiii. 9.) Now can it be with reaſon imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that almighty GOD commands us to do thus, and yet in the mean time gives authority to any to puniſh or kill us for doing it, and for complying with our own judgment in matters purely religious, after the beſt enquiry we can make, or judgment we can form re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the meaning of his word? no ſurely! for if this be the caſe, JEHOVAH commands contradictions, and
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:010181_0021_0F7D434A07161640"/>his word is a ſnare; if we do not examine it, and judge for ourſelves, we ſin; if we do, and through fear of men, act contrary to our judgment and <hi>conſcience we are dammed;</hi> and if we do not act contrary to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences in ſome inſtances we are puniſhed or killed. But theſe conſequences are abſurd, blaſphemous, and impoſſible; and therefore the perſecuting principle from which they proceed is falſe. Is not killing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for GOD's ſake, and all pains and puniſhments tending hereto, the <hi>abomination</hi> of the church of Rome, <hi>that makes deſolate?</hi> Memorable are theſe words of our LORD to his diſciples, (John xvi. 2.3.) <hi>yea the time cometh, that whoſoever killeth you, will think he doth God ſervice, but theſe things will they do unto you, becauſe they have not known the father, or me.</hi> Hereby our LORD ſhews the vanity of pretending to promote reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion by perſecution, and that however zealous and conſcientious any are therein, it proceeds from igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Father and the Son; either abſolute or comparative, they that have a conſiderable degree of acquaintance with CHRIST, muſt needs know, that he rules by truth and love, and not by fire and ſword: So that perſecuting principles and practice, inſtead of being a ſign of eminence in <hi>religion</hi> as ſome pretend, either prove a total want of it, or at leaſt great weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in it.</p>
            <p>Is it decent or conſiſtent for <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who blame the <hi>church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> for their <hi>cruelty</hi> and <hi>bloodſhed,</hi> to imitate this Mother of <hi>Harlots</hi> in her murderous wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, by propagating her bloody principles? if ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal FORCE be neceſſary to promote RELIGION, it will neceſſarily follow, that the Popiſh IMPLICIT FAITH is found doctrine, that KNOWLEDGE is danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and IGNORANCE the mother of devotion: becauſe the leſs knowledge we have, the more eaſily we can
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:010181_0022_0F7D434AB08802E0"/>ſubmit <hi>blindfold,</hi> to an <hi>abſolute authority:</hi> but when any do ſo in matters purely religious, they admit and obey another KING in CHRIST'S <hi>kingdom;</hi> and ſo commence REBELS againſt his ſupream authority; who is the only LORD, LAWGIVER, and MASTER of his people, by preferring others before him, and ſetting up their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in oppoſition to his. (James iv. 12. Matthew xxiii. 10.) Hereby the formal reaſon, or chief excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of religious obedience, viz. a ſupreme regard to CHRIST'S kingly power and commanding pleaſure, is deſtroyed; and conſequently we ceaſe to be the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of GOD, and become the ſervants of men, from whom we muſt look for our reward, (Galatians i. 10. Matthew vi. 2.)</p>
            <p>IF external FORCE be neceſſary to promote RELIGION, then grievous <hi>pains</hi> and DEATH itſelf, are neceſſary to be inflicted for this purpoſe; becauſe the leaſt degree of puniſhment naturally leads to, and neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the greateſt, not only by reaſon of the different degrees of heinouſneſs, attending different errors in principle and conduct, but eſpecially on account of the encreaſing aggravations of <hi>perſiſting</hi> long therein; which is ever called by impoſers, an <hi>obſtinate</hi> and <hi>rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious oppoſition</hi> to <hi>authority,</hi> and therefore muſt be pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed in proportion, gradually, till it iſſues in <hi>death:</hi> Beſides it ſhould be conſidered that more or leſs in the <hi>degree</hi> does not vary the <hi>kind:</hi> If the loweſt degree of temporal puniſhment be proper and neceſſary, on the account of religion; the higheſt muſt be ſo, when the circumſtances of the caſe require it; and if the higheſt be bad, ſo by a neceſſary conſequence is the loweſt, for the general <hi>kind</hi> includes all <hi>degrees.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Inquiſition</hi> is the <hi>perfection</hi> of <hi>chriſtianity;</hi> or in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther words, the moſt pious, worthy, and effectual method of promoting it that has been yet diſcovered: O horrible! but I forbear leſt <hi>humanity</hi> itſelf ſhould be ſhocked, and its tender reſentments too much moved, at the ſight of a <hi>ſcene</hi> of ſuch monſtrous <hi>barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,</hi> as are a <hi>reproach</hi> to the human ſpecies, a <hi>ſcandal</hi> to the name of man!

Can idolatry be rebellion againſt GOD conſidered as the king of a nation, (in a civil ſenſe) where he is not king (in ſaid ſenſe?)

               <hi>Abel: Chriſt's yoke is eaſy, and his burden light,</hi> (Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew xi. 30.) he has <hi>redeemed his people that were under the law,</hi> under <hi>bondage,</hi> and given them the <hi>Adoption of ſons,</hi> and the <hi>ſpirit of adoption,</hi> ſo that <hi>they are no more ſervants, but ſons.</hi> (Galatians iv. 5.7.) He has given them religious <hi>liberty,</hi> and commands them to <hi>ſtand faſt</hi> in it, and <hi>not to be entangled again with the yoke of bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</hi> (Galatians v. 1.) And hence it appears that the inflicting temporal penalties on account of religion, even <hi>materially</hi> (though not formally, or conſidered as ſuch) inſtead of promoting the <hi>reformation</hi> of the <hi>goſpel church, judaizes</hi> her, <hi>robs</hi> her of her <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>comfort,</hi> makes her <hi>carnal,</hi> brings her back to a ſtate of <hi>infancy, bondage,</hi> and <hi>terror,</hi> from all which a good GOD has graciouſly delivered her.

            <p>But were there no examples of violence among the chriſtians long ſince? I am ſorry I cannot do ſo much honour to chriſtianity, as to anſwer in the negative. The truth is, after the three firſt centuries, that gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en age of the Church expired; when <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great, the emperor of the <hi>Romans,</hi> became a chriſtian, and with the richeſt profuſion, and kindeſt intention, generouſly advanced the chriſtian Biſhops to great wealth and dignity; divers of them became unchriſtian, yea, in ſome degree, antichriſtian and inhuman: they degenerated from the primitive ſimplicity, humility, meekneſs, diſintereſted holineſs, and brotherly love of their proas predeceſſors; which were their beauty and their ſtrength; and ſunk into the ſelfiſh, ambitious, and invidious ſpirit of the world, and the god of it, who was a murderer from the beginning, and fell by his boundleſs arrogance from the height of dignity and happineſs, into the depths of woe. Being intoxicated with grandeur and affluence, and thirſting after domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, they under the ſpecious, but ſtale pretexts of zeal for truth, order, and government, were guilty of ſuch carnal contentions, and that even about trides;

(Iſaiah lvii. 17. Proverbs i. 32.) and hence our LORD aſſures us, that it is eaſier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of GOD, (Matthew xix. 24.) had this been ſpoken of the poor, it would have been eaſily and generally believed, and earneſtly attended to; but as it oppoſes a favourite paſſion, few ſeem to believe or regard it. If we judge of men's ſentiments and diſpoſitions by their ſpeech and conduct, or as our LORD expreſſes it, of the tree by its fruits, (Matthew xii. 33.) how difficult is it, to hold a full cup even? The timber that without injury endures the ſtorms of winter, ſometimes warps in the gentle heat of ſummer. Ah how is the gold become dim, and

            <p>THE truth is, the firſt reformers did many things well; they made a noble ſtand againſt many important awful errors of the church of Rome, ſuch as idolatry, dependence on works in the articles of juſtification, and againſt divers ſuperſtitious and ridiculous ceremonies either of their own invention, or which they borrowed from their Pagan neighbours, whom they as meanly as inconſiſtently aped herein, though under the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous umbrage of chriſtian names.</p>
            <p>THE reformers deſerve commendation, for the great ſervice they have done to religion, by their bold and gallant oppoſition to the aforeſaid abominations, and others of the like kind, though enforced by all the artillery of the church, in conjunction with the more formidable ſword of the ſtate; and for their carrying on the reformation ſo far as they did; and we have great reaſon to bleſs GOD while we live for the good they have done, and for their deſires that the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might be carried on ſtill farther. They did not ſet up themſelves as an abſolute ſtandard. If any of their poſterity have made this wicked uſe of them and their labour, they are to blame for this, and not the firſt reformers.</p>
            <p>BUT it is notwithſtanding matter of fact, that theſe worthy men have failed in ſome things of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, eſpecially in theſe, viz. that they did not oppoſe perſecution root and branch wherever, whenever, or by whomſoever it is inflicted, whether Papiſt or Proteſtant, Jew, Turk, or Pagan; whether by the church or ſtate, or by both in conjunction; and likewiſe that they divided among themſelves, and made their churches ſeperate parties by incloſures of
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:010181_0041_0F7D4360A86873B0"/>their own invention, or by making terms of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that CHRIST never made; whereby the body of CHRIST is rent in pieces, and ſeveral parties are ſet in oppoſition to each other, who labour to promote their carnal factions, in the carnal way of hatred, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance, ſtrife, backbiting, and ſlander; by which the intereſts of the grand enemy are promoted inſtead of the Mediators kingdom.</p>
            <p>HEREIN we may, as in a glaſs, behold the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of our forefathers, and the folly of making them the abſolute ſtandards of our faith and practice, or the <hi>plus ultra</hi> of our religion, as ſome bigots would have us; but, GOD forbid. No, CHRIST is our maſter, and the Bible, the Bible is our rule! Let us, Sirs, follow them ſo far as they followed CHRIST, but no farther; let us value and imitate their excellencies, but in the mean time pity and avoid their blemiſhes.

               <p>ARE Peacemakers bleſſed, and ſhall they be called the children of God? then by the law of contraries, we may learn, that ſuch are in a dangerous ſituation who promote contention and diviſion, who, inſtead of heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing breaches, widen them, and make new rents in the church of God, inſtead of covering the ſin of their brethren, needleſsly expoſe and aggravate them, and perhaps add groundleſs charges to them, which have a tendency to mar their uſefulneſs and promote recrimination and confuſion; what contracted and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted views of things muſt ſuch perſons have, who prefer ſmall things to great, minute points in ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to brotherly love, and to the peace and union of Chriſt's kingdom! who pretend to promote the good of the church, by that which directly tends to her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire ruin; I mean unneceſſary diviſions; if we bite and devour one another, we may expect to be conſumed one of another. Church purity in reſpect of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and the power of piety are no doubt deſirable and amiable, and ought to be promoted and preſerved, but how? not by methods of our deviſing, but by the uſe of ſuch only as divine wiſdom has preſcribed; a long tract of time has fully proved, that human contrivances in matters of religion, however well intended, have not anſwered their deſign. Let us therefore ſtand faſt in the liberty wherewith Chriſt has made us free. When the zealous, but narrow minded, and over forward diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples wanted to pluck up the tares, our Saviour forbid them, leaſt they ſhould do injury to the wheat, and ordered that both ſhould be ſuffered to grow together till the harveſt, (Matthew xiii. 28. 30.) Can church <hi>dividers</hi> with reaſon expect the approbation of Chriſt, or to be accounted the children of God, who diſobey his authority, and contradict his example? No: we are
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:010181_0043_0F7D436415C597D8"/>on the contrary enjoined to mark thoſe that cauſe divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and to avoid them, <hi>for they that are ſuch ſerve not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt but their own belly; and by good words and ſair ſpeeches deceive the hearts of the ſimple!</hi> (Romans xvi. 17.) for all their pretences to ſuperior piety and orthodoxy, ſuch as promote <hi>envying, ſtriſe and diviſions are carnal, and walk as men;</hi> men deſtitute of the principles of true goodneſs, ſuch as glory in their parties and factions, and ſay they are of Paul or of Apollos, are carnal, <hi>who is Paul and who is Apollos?</hi> (1 Corinthians iii. 3.5.)</p>
