            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN EULOGY.</head>
            <p>ON this day, my reſpectable hearers, it has long been the practice, in various parts of our country, to celebrate the birth of that DIGNIFIED AND BELOVED CHARACTER, to whom we acknowledge ourſelves, under GOD, ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indebted for our national exiſtence.—</p>
            <p>United millions are, probably, now convened to mourn his exit.—</p>
            <p>The undiſſembled ſorrow, which his removal from theſe earthly ſcenes, has occaſioned, and which it muſt occaſion, wherever the tidings of it ſpread, among the friends of liberty and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:036839_0004_100B1D81203AB3B0"/>
in every corner of the world, has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready well expreſſed, in many excellent perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances on the ſubject.</p>
            <p>But as our POLITICAL FATHERS, have with a unanimous voice, recommended this particular day, for manifeſting the public grief at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe, and the public reſpect for the memory of our ILLUSTRIOUS FATHER, PATRON, AND FRIEND: I will endeavor to ſuggeſt ſome obſervations and reflections, which I hope will be thought not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable to this ſolemnity.—</p>
            <p>The Death of ſo great, ſo good a man; of one, who has been ſo diſtinguiſhed an inſtrument, in the hand of Providence, of diſpenſing bleſſings to his country and mankind; and whoſe longer continuance here, we ſo ardently deſired; is an event, which we may well mourn. But let us mourn, with humble reſignation.—</p>
            <p>That he, who poſſeſſed every public and every private virtue, which ever adorned the life of any mortal, and who lived in the continual exerciſe
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:036839_0005_100B1D84A95CC690"/>
of theſe virtues, ſhould be taken from us, at this critical period of our public affairs, is among the myſteries of that Providence, whoſe "judgments are unſearchable and whoſe ways are paſt find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out."—</p>
            <p>Death is a theme, which every rational being ought frequently to contemplate.—And when any of our fellow-creatures around us, are ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to leave the world, it ſhould remind us that the time of our departure may alſo be near at hand, and excite us to live in an habitual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for its important conſequences.—But when the great and the good, the virtuous and the wiſe, men who were the glory of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and the ornaments of human nature, are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off this ſtage of action; we ſhould conſider the wiſdom and the virtue, the patriotiſm and the benevolence, which made them ſo uſeful in their day and generation, ſo much beloved in life, ſo ſincerely regretted in death, and which height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en their reward in the regions of celeſtial glory.—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:036839_0006_100B1D86D1EDFB28"/>That we ſhould make a wiſe improvement, of thoſe eminent examples of exalted virtue, which are here ſet before us, is a dictate of reaſon, and it is the correſpondent language of revelation. For the improvement we make of them, we are accountable to HIM, who is the Author of our being, the Source of all our mercies, the Inſpector of our conduct, the Rewarder of virtue and the Puniſher of vice.—</p>
            <p>It is an eſtabliſhed rule of God's moral govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they, who are favored with ſuperior advantages, ſhould bring forth ſuperior fruit to his praiſe.—And what can be more reaſonable, than that they ſhould be diſtinguiſhed for their behavior as men, as chriſtians, as members of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, as citizens of a free and an independent country; who have not only every induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in point of intereſt, to diſcharge theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant duties of life, with fidelity; but who have alſo before them, the animating example of <hi>ONE</hi> who has performed theſe duties, with ſo much honor to himſelf, with ſo much benefit to his country, and to the admiration of mankind?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:036839_0007_100B1D88EF44C4E0"/>Never were thoſe virtues, which exalt and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify human nature, exhibited in a more pleaſing and a more uſeful light, by any of the ſons of Adam, than, in that BEST OF MEN, whoſe loſs, we this day mourn.—His domeſtic circle, or they, who had the happineſs to make part of his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, bear unequivocal teſtimony to his tender and endearing attentions; to the diſplay of all thoſe virtues, which ſmooth life's rugged paths, and give a peculiar zeſt to its ſweeteſt pleaſures.—His profound reſpect for the conſtitution and laws of his country; his readineſs to ſacrifice his private intereſt to the public good, are too well known, ever to be called in queſtion.—</p>
            <p>His attachment to that religion, which is the beſt friend of man; that religion, with which the true happineſs of individuals, of families, of ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and of nations, is inſeparably connected, was abundantly manifeſted. —OUR WASHINGTON WAS "NOT ASHAMED OF THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST." He was not only firmly eſtabliſhed in the belief of this divine ſyſtem; but he made a public pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of his faith, and he adorned its doctrines
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:036839_0008_100B1D8B71485D10"/>
by a well ordered converſation. He eſteemed it his higheſt honor, to be numbered among the followers of the MEEK AND LOWLY MASTER.— Of his rational and unaffected devotion, no one could, with any degree of propriety, entertain a doubt. And the goodneſs of his motives, in the performance of every moral duty, <hi>Malice</hi> itſelf, could find no ground to impeach.—</p>
            <p>What a genuine luſtre, does it reflect upon his character, that he was ever diſpoſed to acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge the SUPERINTENDING PROVIDENCE OF GOD; not only when ſurrounded by proſperity; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in ſeaſons of the deepeſt diſtreſs.—His confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was placed in that Being, who had often ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared for him in the time of adverſity, who can bring good out of evil, light out of darkneſs; and who, he fondly hoped and ſincerely believed, had many bleſſings in ſtore, for his much lov'd country.—Thus was he enabled to perſevere, with the greateſt fortitude and reſolution, in the way of his duty, under difficulties and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that would have damped the ardor of a leſs elevated ſoul; to revive the drooping ſpirits
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:036839_0009_100B1D8DA68CB6A0"/>
of his countrymen, and finally to defeat the hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile plans of thoſe who wiſhed to enſlave them.</p>
            <p>Happy was it for AMERICA; that ſhe poſſeſſed ſuch a character, in one of her own ſons! Happy was it for her, that her moſt diſtinguiſhed citizen, was not leſs diſtinguiſhed, for his piety and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, than for thoſe great and glorious actions, which were more publicly known, and which have made his fame as extenſive as the limits of the earth.—</p>
            <p>Let our great men, whether in civil, in milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or in private ſtations, remember, that they cannot reſemble WASHINGTON, in one of the moſt beautiful and honorable traits in his charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; if they are not the ſincere friends of religion. Deſtitute of this, they may perform many ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did actions, which ſhall command the loud hoſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas of the multitude, the vain applauſe of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking rabble.—But deſtitute of this, they can never merit, nor enjoy the laſting confidence of the wiſe and good. Nor will they ever be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſhare in thoſe future and eternal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:036839_0010_100B1D91530C24F8"/>
which await thoſe exalted characters, who have performed the worthieſt deeds, from the beſt of motives.—</p>
            <p>To recite all the virtues of this GODLIKE MAN; particularly to enumerate his celebrated exploits; to relate all the unparalleled ſervices, which he has rendered to his country and mankind; would be an employment, to which, I feel myſelf, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unequal; and which the preſent occaſion, does my no means demand.—</p>
            <p>Let this be the buſineſs of the elegant hiſtorian, and the faithful biographer.—I ſhall now only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to call your attention to ſome of the moſt remarkable tranſactions in his public life; tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which many of you, well remember; and which our children and our children's children will long peruſe, with mingled emotions of grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itude and admiration.—</p>
            <p>At a very early period of his life, WASHINGTON diſplayed thoſe military talents, which would have done honor to a veteran General; and, it
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:036839_0011_100B1D937980DB10"/>
was evidently owing to his prudent conduct, that any part of the army of the unfortunate <hi>Braddock</hi> was reſcued from the horrid vengeance of their ſavage enemies.—</p>
            <p>That our DEPARTED FRIEND was the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed actor in that memorable revolution, which ſevered us from the <hi>Britiſh Empire;</hi> and which conſtituted us, a <hi>Free, Sovereign, and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Nation</hi>; no one will preſume to deny. It is a truth eſtabliſhed beyond the poſſibility of a doubt, wherever our important and intereſting hiſtory is known.—And that he was raiſed up, by Almighty GOD, to accompliſh theſe great things for us; we muſt be ſtrangely blinded not to ſee, and ſhamefully ungrateful not to acknowledge.</p>
            <p>The peculiar talents, with which, the Author of every good and every perfect gift, was pleaſed to favor him, and his diligent improvement of theſe talents, qualified him for filling the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted ſtations in life, with the higheſt honor to himſelf and the greateſt benefit to his fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. His aſtoniſhing penetration, his unſhaken
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:036839_0012_100B1D9503E11E48"/>
firmneſs and unrivalled influence, have by the bleſſing of heaven, kindly preſerved us, when our beſt temporal intereſts have been in imminent danger, and ſeaſonably diſpelled the dark clouds, which overſhadowed our political proſpects.—</p>
            <p>The wiſdom, the prudence, the undaunted courage which this GREAT MAN, invariably man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ifeſted, as the Leader of our armies, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with one of the moſt powerful nations upon earth, are univerſally known; and were confeſſed, even by his enemies. They have raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a monument to his fame, which will remain unmoved, till every record of the inhabitants of this globe ſhall be loſt.—</p>
            <p>Let us enquire of thoſe, who well knew the threatning aſpect of our public affairs, toward the cloſe of our revolutionary war; who well recollect that dangerous, that rebellious ſpirit, which ſome unprincipled men, then endeavored to inſtill into the minds of the army. They will unitedly agree in aſſuring us, that it was principally owing to the vigilant conduct and the guardian care of our
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:036839_0013_100B1D971A897500"/>
beloved WASHINGTON, that this dangerous ſpirit was cruſhed, while yet in embryo. Whereas had it been permitted to rage, and ſpread its baneful ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, it would have greatly tarniſhed the glory of our revolution, and fixed a diſgrace upon our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional character, which revolving ages would not have been able to efface.</p>
            <p>At this moſt critical period, our ILLUSRIOUS FRIEND, was the great inſtrument, in the hand of GOD, of ſaving us from the impending calamity, and preſerving to his victorious army, that high reputation which they had ſo juſtly acquired.

wiſe, firm, and dignified conduct when placed, by the united voice of a grateful and an admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people, at the head of our nation, made us proſperous at home, and highly reſpected abroad. The deep concerted plans, which the rulers of a foreign nation contrived, to entangle us in the quarrels of Europe, and in all the diſtreſſes of war; and which their emiſſaries, one after another, were commiſſioned to put in execution; his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical diſcernment effectually fruſtrated, and gave a moſt fatal blow to the baſe deſigns of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign and domeſtic enemies.</p>
            <p>The invaluable legacy, which this GREAT AND GOOD MAN has bequeathed his country, in that <hi>paternal addreſs,</hi> which he made to them, when he ſignified his intention to reſign the high truſts and weighty cares of public life, cannot be too highly prized. If we regard it as we ought, it will be our beſt ſecurity againſt the wiles of thoſe who are envious at our growing fame. It will preſerve and increaſe to us the rich bleſſings which we now enjoy.</p>

            <p>His unaffected piety, his uncommon virtues, have cauſed him to be revered, in every corner of the earth; and have ranked him among the beſt of Generals, the beſt of Stateſmen, and the beſt of Men.</p>
            <p>Let us be grateful to that kind Being, who is the giver of life, and the lengthener out of our days; that he continued with us ſo long, our FATHER, PATRON, AND FRIEND; and that he made him the miniſter of ſo much good to his country and mankind.

            <p>It will not, I am perſuaded, be thought foreign to our ſubject, if I here remind you, that our hearts ſhould riſe in gratitude to the great DISPOSER OF EVENTS, that HE has raiſed up one, to be placed at the head of our nation, in whom the ILLUSTRIOUS AND BELOVED PERSON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AGE whom has left our world, we humbly truſt, for a world of glory, had the higheſt confidence, and of whoſe adminiſtration he warmly approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Our ſincere thanks are certainly due to the SUPREME GOVERNOR OF THE UNIVERSE, that HE has favored us with one, to ſill the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſtation in our government; whoſe ſuperior talents, whoſe long tried ſervices, and unſhaken fidelity, entitle him to the unreſerved confidence and gratitude of his country. His name is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy enrolled with the greateſt characters, who have appeared on earth; and his glorious exertions to eſtabliſh the independence, to promote the welfare and the proſperity of this FEDERAL EMPIRE, will

            <p>Cordially do we wiſh him the beſt of heaven's bleſſings! Fervently do we pray that he may be ſupported under that painful bereavement, which he ſenſibly feels with his afflicted country! May his important life be long preſerved! May his important ſervices never be eraſed from our hearts! May that God, in whom he truſts protect him! May that religion, of which, like his great predeceſſor in office, he is not aſhamed, conſole him, under all his trials and difficulties, while here, and everlaſting glories reward him hereafter.</p>
            <p>Few indeed, among the children of men, are ever made the inſtruments, in the hand of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, of diſpenſing ſo much good to their fellow-creatures; as was the GREAT, the GOOD, the BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOVED MAN, whoſe loſs we this day mourn.

For however humble the employments in which we are now engaged,— however obſcure the ſpheres in which we now move,—the All-ſeeing God will behold us through the journey of life, with ſmiles of approbation. We ſhall hereafter join the great and the good, whom we loved, eſteemed, and revered on earth. With them we ſhall inherit thoſe bright abodes, where there is fulneſs of joy. With them ſhall we drink of thoſe pure ſtreams, which flow from his right hand, where there are pleaſures forevermore.</p>
