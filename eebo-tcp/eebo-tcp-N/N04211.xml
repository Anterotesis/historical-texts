            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A PROPOSAL for Promoting USEFUL KNOWLEDGE among the British Plantations in America.</head>
            <p>THE <hi>English</hi> are possess'd of a long Tract of Continent, from <hi>Nova Scotia</hi> to <hi>Georgia,</hi> extending North and South thro' different Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, having different Soils, producing different Plants, Mines and Minerals, and capable of different Improvements, Manufactures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first Drudgery of Settling new Colonies, which confines the Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of People to mere Necessaries, is now pretty well over; and there are many in every Province in Circumstances that set them at Ease, and afford Leisure to cultivate the finer Arts, and improve the common Stock of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. To such of these who are Men of Speculation, many Hints must from time to time arise, many Observations occur, which if well-examined, pursued and improved, might produce Discoveries to the Advantage of some or all of the <hi>British</hi> Plantations, or to the Benefit of Mankind in general.</p>
            <p>But as from the Extent of the Country such Persons are widely separated, and seldom can see and converse or be acquainted with each other, so that many useful Particulars remain uncommunicated, die with the Discoverers, and are lost to Mankind it is, to remedy this Inconvenience for the future, proposed,</p>
            <p>That One Society be formed of Virtuosi or ingenious Men residing in the several Colonies, to be called <hi>The American Philosophical Society;</hi> who are to maintain a constant Correspondence.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Philadelphia</hi> being the City nearest the Centre of the Continent-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, communicating with all of them northward and southward by Post, and with all the Islands by Sea, and having the Advantage of a good growing Library, be the Centre of the Society.</p>
            <p>That at <hi>Philadelphia</hi> there be always at least seven Members, <hi>viz.</hi> a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician, a Botanist, a Mathematician, a Chemist, a Mechanician, a Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, and a general Natural Philosopher, besides a President, Treasurer and Secretary.</p>
            <p>That these Members meet once a Month, or oftner, at their own Expence, to communicate to each other their Observations, Experiments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive read and consider such Letters, Communications, or Queries as shall be sent from distant Members; to direct the Dispersing of Copies of such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications as are valuable, to other distant Members, in order to procure their Sentiments thereupon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Subjects of the Correspondence be, All new-discovered Plants, Herbs, Trees, Roots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> their Virtues, Uses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Methods of Propagating them, and making such as are useful, but particular to some Plantations, more general. Improvements of vegetable Juices, as Cyders, Wines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> New Methods of Curing or Preventing Diseases. All new-discovered Fossils in different Countries, as Mines, Minerals, Quarries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> New and useful Improvements in any Branch of Mathematicks. New Discoveries in Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistry, such as Improvements in Distillation, Brewing, Assaying of Ores, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> New Mechanical Inventions for saving Labour; as Mills, Carriages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and for Raising and Conveying of Water, Draining of Meadows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All
<pb facs="unknown:005190_0002_10171157BB8C5AB0"/>
new Arts, Trades, Manufactures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that may be proposed or thought of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Surveys, Maps and Charts of particular Parts of the Sea-coasts, or Inland Countries; Course and Junction of Rivers and great Roads, Situation of Lakes and Mountains, Nature of the Soil and Productions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> New Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Improving the Breed of useful Animals; Introducing other Sorts from foreign Countries. New Improvements in Planting, Gardening, Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Land, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And all philosophical Experiments that let Light into the Nature of Things, tend to increase the Power of Man over Matter, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply the Conveniencies or Pleasures of Life.</p>
            <p>That a Correspondence already begun by some intended Members, shall be kept up by this Society with the ROYAL SOCIETY of <hi>London,</hi> and with the DUBLIN SOCIETY.</p>
            <p>That every Member shall have Abstracts sent him Quarterly, of every Thing valuable communicated to the Society's Secretary at <hi>Philadelphia;</hi> free of all Charge except the Yearly Payment hereafter mentioned.</p>
            <p>That by Permission of the Postmaster-General, such Communications pass between the Secretary of the Society and the Members, Postage-free.</p>
            <p>That for defraying the Expence of such Experiments as the Society shall judge proper to cause to be made, and other contingent Charges for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Good, every Member send a Piece of Eight <hi>per Annum</hi> to the Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> to form a Common Stock, to be disburs'd by Order of the President with the Consent of the Majority of the Members that can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently be consulted thereupon, to such Persons and Places where and by whom the Experiments are to be made, and otherwise as there shall be Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; of which Disbursements an exact Account shall be kept, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated yearly to every Member.</p>
            <p>That at the first Meetings of the Members at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> such Rules be formed for Regulating their Meetings and Transactions for the General Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, as shall be convenient and necessary; to be afterwards changed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd as there shall be Occasion, wherein due Regard is to be had to the Advice of distant Members.</p>
            <p>That at the End of every Year, Collections be made and printed, of such Experiments, Discoveries, Improvements, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as may be thought of publick Advantage: And that every Member have a Copy sent him.</p>
            <p>That the Business and Duty of the Secretary be, To receive all Letters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the Society, and lay them before the President and Members at their Meetings; to abstract, correct and methodize such Papers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it, and as he shall be directed to do by the President, after they have been considered, debated and digested in the Society; to enter Copies thereof in the Society's Books, and make out Copies for distant Members; to answer their Letters by Direction of the President, and keep Records of all material Transactions of the Society, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
