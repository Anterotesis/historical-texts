            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE words choſen as the theme of the enſuing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, come recommended to us at this day of tribulation, as the direction given to the ſuffering Jews, to ſupport their minds under the terror and troubles of perſecutors, while they ſuffered for righteouſneſs ſake: But their pertinence in this day of war, may appear from their connexion with the ſcripture hiſtory which gives occaſion to them; which therefore I beg leave to narrate; not, my hearers, becauſe you are ignorant of it, but becauſe a freſh remembrance of it gives me an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in laying out my plan.</p>
            <p>AHAZ, at the time of this prophecy, was king of Judah, as Pekah, ſon of Remaliah, was of Iſrael; the capital of whoſe kingdom was Samaria. Upon the throne of Syria was Rezin, whoſe metropolis was Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus. There was alſo Aſſyria upon the river Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates, with a powerful monarch then on the throne.</p>
            <p>REZIN and Pekah entered into a confederacy, againſt the king of Judah, to dethrone him, and ſet up in his room the ſon of Tabeal. The news of this confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy occaſioned great fear to the houſe of David. The LORD therefore ordered the prophet Iſaiah to go forth
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:015285_0005_0F9882AA3B8F6408"/>
with his ſon Shear-Jaſhab, (whoſe name ſignified a remnant ſhall return) to meet Ahaz, and ſay to him,
<q>take heed and be quiet; fear not, neither be faint hearted;</q>
and to aſſure him, that the evil counſel which Syria and Samaria had taken againſt him, ſhould not come to paſs; but that within three ſcore and five years, Ephraim, i. e. Samaria ſhould be broken, that it ſhould not be a people.—However, their belief of this was required, as a condition of fulfilment,
<q>if ye will not believe, ſurely ye ſhall not be eſtabliſhed.</q>
The LORD moreover commanded Ahaz to aſk a ſign; but he, accounting this a tempting the LORD, refuſed. GOD, after rebuking him, gave this ſign,
<q>Behold a virgin ſhall conceive and bear a ſon, and ſhall call his name Immanuel —For before the child ſhall know to refuſe the evil and chuſe the good, the land that thou abhoreſt ſhall be forſaken of both her kings.</q>
That is the child Shear-Jaſhub, ſays Mr. Henry.</p>
            <p>"MOREOVER, the LORD" commanded the prophet to
<q>take a great roll, and write in it with a man's pen, concerning Mahar-ſhalal-haſh-baz,</q>
perhaps to enrol his name as one promiſed by GOD to him: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<q>he went in unto the propheteſs, i. e. his wife, and ſhe conceived and bear a ſon,</q>
and the LORD commanded him to "call his name Mahar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhalal-haſh-baz," i. e. make ſpeed to the ſpoil, or haſten to the prey. Whence the prophet ſays,
<q>Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me, are for ſigns and for wonders in Iſrael.</q>
This promiſe is alſo added,
<q>For before the child ſhall have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to cry, My father and my mother, the riches of Damaſcus, and the ſpoil of Samaria ſhall be taken away before the king of Aſſyria.</q>
It is worthy of notice, that ſome in the kingdom of Judah, which was the moſt righteous and equitable government then on earth, were uneaſy under it, and deſirous of being under
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:015285_0006_0F9882AB0074F950"/>
Rezin and Pekah, which is elegantly expreſſed,
<q>For as much as this people refuſeth the waters of Shiloah that go ſoftly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's ſon,</q> &amp;c. whence, it is evidently no uncommon thing, for perſons to be uneaſy, under the moſt mild and righteous government, which the GOD of heaven hath eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>WHEN the king of Judah, and his nobles heard of this league between Rezin and Remaliah's ſon, they were all ſo faſt, for entering into a confederacy with ſome power to aſſiſt them, which was diſagreable to to the LORD of hoſts; for he would have his people have their dependence upon him, and look to him for ſalvation. The prophet was therefore inſtructed of GOD, to divert them from a confederacy. He therefore repreſents the alliance of Syria and Samaria, and the futility of their league, v. 9, 10, and lays before them the inſtruction GOD gave him reſpecting that affair;
<q>For the LORD ſpake thus to me with a ſtrong hand, and inſtructed me that I ſhould not walk in the way of this people, ſaying, Say ye not A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy to all them to whom this people ſhall ſay, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.</q>
GOD impreſſed his mind fully—made him ſtrong againſt the prejudices of the people who at that day, ſeemed to think of no other way of deliverance, but by confront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing force with force. The way of that people which GOD would not have him walk in, was alſo a ſinful fear, to the neglect of a religious dependance upon GOD's almighty arm for ſalvation. They neglected repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and reformation, and were about to guard them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt diſtreſſing fear, by a confederacy. Our text points out to us the will of GOD at ſuch a time. "Sanctify the LORD OF HOSTS himſelf," &amp;c.</p>
            <p>IN a time of eminent danger, when multitudes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine againſt the people of GOD, inſtead of mitigating
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:015285_0007_0F9882ABC16256F0"/>
their fear by a confederacy, it is their duty and intereſt to ſanctify the LORD of hoſts himſelf, and make him their fear, and dread. <note n="*" place="bottom">The preacher means to handle the ſubject theologically, not politically, and thinks it proper to enter this caveat, leſt any might ſuſpect an innuendo from his uſe of the word confederacy.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THIS ſubject may naturally be conſidered in two parts.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. To ſhow wherein this ſanctification of the LORD of Hoſts conſiſts.</item>
               <item>II. THAT it is the duty and intereſt of GOD's people, thus to ſanctify him in ſuch a time of danger.</item>
            </list>
            <p>AS it was the diſtreſſing fear of an invaſion, that occaſioned this direction, which GOD would cure by turning this paſſion to its true object: ſuffer me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark a word upon it in this place.</p>
            <p>FEAR is of all paſſions in man the moſt frantic, and leaſt under the government of reaſon, and yet of all paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions the moſt natural and deeply rooted in ſenſitive nature; therefore, common to man with all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which have any conſiderable degree of ſenſe; crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which ſcarce betray any other paſſion, evidence the force of this, in flying danger. While the object of fear, whether real or imaginary, is ſtrongly painted on the imagination in all the horror of dreadfuls, all the reaſoning of men can't allay it. You may as well at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to reaſon a dead man to life, as to conjure down fear by reaſon. There is no cure for it in nature, but this in our text, (nam.) placing before the mind an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject more fearful, yet an object of truſt; ſo turning men from a ſinful to a religious fear. This is the way GOD takes to bring all undue paſſions in fallen nature to regularity, by placing them upon their genuine ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, where there is no danger of exceſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:015285_0008_0F9882AC811BC0A0"/>PASS now to ſhew wherein this ſanctification of the LORD of hoſts conſiſts; where, for brevity ſake, it may be remembered, that the word ſanctification conveys different ideas, according to the agent acting, or the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject towards which it is acted. When GOD is the agent, and inanimate matter the object ſanctified, it is ſetting a part any thing from common to holy uſes. When GOD is the agent, and rational yet fallen man the object, it is the renewing ſuch "after the image of him that created him." When man is the agent, and GOD the object, as in our preſent diſcourſe; it is the acting forth, holy diſpoſitions and affections of renewed nature ſuitably, towards the various perfections of DEITY; and ſince religious fear with reverence is due in regard to all his perfections, attributes and manifeſtations, the whole of religion is ſummed up in the fear of the LORD. Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the LORD of HOSTS, and letting him be our fear and our dread, are but ſynonimous, though explanative terms. This ſanctification of the LORD of HOSTS con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in a belief of the being of GOD; this is the great foundation of natural religion, without which there can be no true religion. "For he that cometh to GOD muſt believe that he is." To pretend ſanctity, or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to eſtabliſh vital piety, goſpel holineſs in men's hearts, without this foundation principle, is as abſurd as to pretend to lay the top ſtone in the air before the foundation is laid on the ground. When St. Paul went to goſpelize the Romans, then an heathen nation, he firſt laboured to eſtabliſh this foundation principle, ſhewing them, that their idolatrous practices ſtood in the face of natural religion. "For the inviſible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead, &amp;c." The ſame weapon did he uſe, to caſt down Athenian ſuperſtition, which he had evidence of from the "altar, with this inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:015285_0009_0F9882AD3B95D478"/>
TO THE UNKNOWN GOD, whom there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye ignorantly worſhip, him declare I unto you." And this was but following GOD's own method of deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Iſrael, when they had been hundreds of years in ſight of Egyptian idolatry. To eſtabliſh them in a belief of his being, and ſupreme power over all pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed gods, were directed the miracles of Moſes before Pharaoh—their deliverance at the red ſea—the pillar of "the cloud by day," and "the pillar of fire by night," the daily ſupply of manna, and the preſervation of their cloathing upon them. To this end, after diſciplining them by the greateſt General of that, or perhaps of any other age, he led them on to battle, and victory, (Moſes praying to Iſrael's GOD) and afterward in anſwer to Joſhua's requeſt, made the "ſun ſtand ſtill upon Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beon, and" the "moon in the valley of Aijalon," to convince them that he was the author of nature, and LORD of the hoſts of Heaven. This, after the purpoſes of heaven were accompliſhed upon that unbelieving generation, laid the foundation for that eminent piety, which was the glory of that nation; and was ever after remembered by GOD with complacency. "I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thee the love of thine eſpouſals, when thou wenteſt after me in the wilderneſs."</p>
            <p>IN a ſteadfaſt belief that he is the LORD of HOST, that all hoſts of angels, men, animals, inſects, yea and devils, are under his ſupreme command and ſovran controul. To eſtabliſh this foundation principle—this moſt effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual guard againſt idolatry, did the GOD of heaven work a miracle, and conſtrained the proud monarch of Babylon to acknowledge, that his "dominion is an everlaſting dominion, and his kingdom is from gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to generation. And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:015285_0010_0F9882ADFB01FCD0"/>
of the earth: and none can ſtay his hand, or ſay unto him, what doſt thou?" This truth, fully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, ſhews us, that angels, or men, or animals, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects, or the hoſts of heaven, or the elements, muſt act according to his command; either as inſtruments of vengeance to correct a backſliding people, or as miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſalvation to his choſen ones. "Fire and hail, ſnow and vapour," with "ſtormy wind fulfilling his word." Angels as miniſtering ſpirits, miniſtring to them who ſhall be the heirs of glory, or miniſters of vengeance, to his people's adverſaries—the ſtars in their courſe to fight againſt whom he pleaſes. In conſequence of this ſovran authority, he has an uncontroubled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence over the minds of men; either to inſpire them with greatneſs of ſoul, to perform the ſervices to which he calls them, in his providence, as upon Saul's promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to royalty "GOD gave him another heart," or to deprive the wiſeſt counſellors of their wiſdom. "He leadeth counſellors away ſpoiled, and maketh the judges fools—he looſeth the bands of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle. He leadeth princes away ſpoiled, and overthroweth the mighty. He removeth away the ſpeech of the truſty, and taketh away the underſtanding of the aged. He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the ſtrength of the mighty." It is common with GOD, to ſuffer a ſpirit of deception to come upon the counſellors of a people, when he means to deſtroy them. "The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Noph are deceived, they have alſo ſeduced Egypt, even they that are the ſtay of the tribes thereof. The LORD hath mingled a perverſe ſpirit in the midſt thereof; and they have cauſed Egypt to err in every work thereof, as a drunken man ſtaggereth in his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit." At other times he ſuffers a panic to ſeize the mind, and thus routs formidable armies. The dream of a common ſoldier, told in the camp of Midian, with
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:015285_0011_0F9882AEBB207980"/>
the ſudden manoeuvre of Gideon according, to GOD's direction, accompanied with but three hundred men, became the occaſion of a compleat rout, and total overthrow of that numerous hoſt. Theſe inſtances ſhow the ſovran influence of the LORD of hoſts over kings, princes, and powerful armies. Are hoſts of men raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, armed, and directed againſt a kingdom, nation, or people? It is by the permiſſion of the LORD of hoſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are under his direction and controul. "Hitherto ſhalt thou come, but no further." Senacherib muſt not come into the city, "nor ſhoot an arrow there, nor come before it with ſhield, nor caſt a bank againſt it."</p>
            <p>THE LORD of hoſts, ſends powerful oppreſſing monarchs againſt the rod of his inheritance, ſometimes as the rod in his hand, to correct, and chaſten his people for their ſins; ſome times to ſhew his people his power and preſidency over all hoſts, and to humble them who blaſpheme the GOD of Iſrael. The deſtruction of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh and his hoſts in the red ſea—of Senacherib's army, and the breaking in pieces Syria, and Samaria, whoſe combination occaſioned ſuch conſternation to the houſe of Judah, evidence this; neither can we ſanctify the LORD of hoſts, without ſuch or ſimilar conceptions of him, and of his power over all hoſts of angels, men, yea and all nature.</p>
            <p>TO ſanctify the Lord of Hoſts himſelf men are to have their dependance upon him, as the ſupreme ruler over all, to defeat the devices of their proud enemies, and prevent them from accompliſhing their intended enterprize. The ſin of GOD's people at that day was, that upon hearing of a league between Rezin and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kah, they endeavoured to allay their fear by a confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy. When GOD ſmites his people to bring them to a repentance of their ſins, and to truſt in him, it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy miſtake in them, to ſeek relief from their fears

by a confederacy;<note n="*" place="bottom">The preacher is acting the part of a divine, not of a politician. However confederacies may be lawful in certain caſes, yet a truſt in them to the neglect of truſt in the <hi>LORD</hi> of Hoſts, is ſinful in all inſtances.</note> as though an human arm could defeat the purpoſes of Heaven; or the Almighty wanted to ſee "the young men ariſe and play before him." This is both our ſin, and our miſery, as it leads the mind off from the grand object.</p>
            <p>HOLY David, ſeeing the inclination of men to place their dependence upon an arm of fleſh, to a neglect of the true GOD, ſaid, "Put not your truſt in princes, nor in the ſon of man, in whom there is no help." As though he had ſaid,—you may ſee the inſufficiency of ſuch helpers, from the conſideration of their being but mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, ſhort lived creatures: "His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth, in that very day his thoughts periſh." Wherefore, inſtead of putting your truſt in them, whether prince, people, a mighty hoſt, or in a confederacy—ſanctify the LORD of HOSTS himſelf; make him the object of your fear and dependance; "Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whoſe hope is in the LORD his GOD." Making a league, and truſting in that and in man for ſalvation out of the hand of enemies, are oppoſite to ſanctifying the LORD of HOSTS himſelf.</p>
            <p>AS our GOD is a GOD of invariable juſtice, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, truth and faithfulneſs, ſo, to ſanctify the LORD, we are not only to approve of them in ſpeculation, but become followers of him in the practice of them, "as dear children," which, when done in the fear of the LORD of HOSTS, and in obedience to his commands, is true practical knowledge of GOD. "Did not thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eat and drink, and do judgment and juſtice, and then it was well with him? He judged the cauſe of the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:015285_0013_0F9882B03B70DBA0"/>
poor and needy, then it was well with him, was not this to know me? Saith the LORD." Where there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſenſe nor practice of equity—moral honeſty—no regard to moral obligation, there can be no true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. A righteous, holy GOD holds himſelf bound to puniſh all violators of ſuch ſolemn obligations. "See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he deſpiſed the oath by breaking the covenant (when lo, he had given his hand) and hath done all theſe things, he ſhall not eſcape."</p>
            <p>THIS LORD of HOSTS whom our text calls us to ſanctify, is no other than ELOHEIM—the great "Captain of our ſalvation," who appeared unto Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua as Captain of the LORD's hoſt. Unto him hath the father committed all power "in heaven and in earth," and ſet him at his own right hand in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly places, far above all principalities and powers, and might and dominion, and every name that is named not only in this world, but alſo in that which is to come. And hath put all things under his feet. For he is by nature, and by the act of creation, their lord and proprietor. "For by him were all things created that are in heaven, and that are in earth, viſible and inviſible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: All things were created by him and for him. And he is before all things, and by him all things conſiſt." St. Peter ſums up goſpel holineſs in the words before us, "But ſanctify the LORD GOD in your hearts:" Oppoſed to this, ſtand, prophanation of GOD's name, titles, attributes and word;—rejecting CHRIST the ſon of GOD, a divine perſon, with his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines and precepts; alſo covetouſneſs, which is idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. This fruitful ſource of evil ought to be expoſed to view, for it ſets up the world, and the things of it in the place of God. "That he may ſet his neſt on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil." That dependance which holy ones have upon GOD, in
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:015285_0014_0F9882B0FACED328"/>
the way of his wiſe and kind protecting providence, the covetous place in gold "which is their hope," and in "fine gold" which is their "confidence." Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon is ſparing of coſt for things that reſpect GOD or godlineſs. It may ſpare a little to keep its votaries in countenance among men; but it is liberal even to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeneſs and diſſipation towards its friends, "the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eye, and the pride of life." This very profuſion the coveteous man preſſes into his ſervice, as an invincible argument, that he is free from covetouſneſs. The liberality of the idolator to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his beloved luſt, is a perfect deſcription of the covetous man, in regard to his darling luſt. "They laviſh gold out of the bag, and weigh ſilver in the ballance, and hire a goldſmith, and he maketh it a GOD: They fall down, yea they worſhip." This opens to view that ſeeming contradictory behaviour of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous man's ſparing parſimony in matters that reſpect GOD—acts of benevolence and deeds of charity, to them that are in diſtreſs. From this ſource ſpring oppreſſion, extortion, and the avaricious unmerciful exactions, of the covetous, to magnify their GOD. Mammon in the heart diſſolves moral obligations, breaks over the bonds of juſtice, mercy and fidelity; or rather by its ſorcery makes them appear, but ſilly bands fit only to bind ſcrupulous conſciences. From this view ſee how effectually it will prevent men under its influence, from ſanctifying the LORD in their hearts.</p>
            <p>ONCE more. The luſt of domination greatly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes this ſanctification of the LORD. As the law of gravitation acts upon matter, preſſing it to the center, unleſs ſome ſuperior power reſiſts it: So the love of ſuperiority,—the luſt of domination runs through fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len nature. The author of nature many times ſuffers
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:015285_0015_0F9882B1BAD1D0C8"/>
this to ballance, and counteract itſelf. When it ariſes to tyranny and cruel oppreſſion, the love of power and liberty, joined to reſentment of injury, urges on the oppreſſed to curb and deſtroy it in the tyrant. This luſt, when entrenched behind powerful armies, or the ſhadow of a righteous conſtitution, whoſe vitals are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by venality, bribery and corruption, is the plague of mankind. When mortal men, by art, or ſtratagem, or ſuperior craft, have attained to deſpotic ſway, this luſt ſtill rages; it thirſts for all power, that no one may have opportunity to oppoſe, controul, or caſt it down. This, through a kind of ſtate magic, brings per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons over whom ſuch lordſhip and authority are exerciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to call them benefactors. Such will always rejoice in the adulatory addreſſes of fawning ſycophants: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by theſe they have the confeſſion of them over whom they exerciſe this authority; that they are their benefactors; and ſo are by their own conceſſions cut off from any pretext to oppoſe ſuch domination. This luſt, though moſt viſible and odious, in perſons at the upper end of the world, may however be ſeen in every claſs of men, from Nimrod, the "mighty hunter," down," down to the punſter in the meeting of merry Andrews. He that diſpairs of gaining this ſuperiority by arms, will ſeek it in ſome other way: ſome in dreſs, others in popularity, others in a little exaltation in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. From this ſprings envy at the promotion of my neighbour above dear me: Hence canvaſſing at elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for places of honor and power: So equity, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and public good are often ſacrificed to this luſt of domination: So dear ſelf is adored; but the LORD of Hoſts not ſanctified, The only cure of this evil is by the ſanctification of the ſoul, which brings it to eſteem ſuperiority in righteouſneſs and goodneſs,— "And the upright ſhall have dominion over them in the morning."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:015285_0016_0F9882B27ABDF2D8"/>PRAYER, comprized by our Saviour under the term of thankſgiving, is a duty which would have been obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory upon man though he had remained innocent.</p>
            <p>THE gift of a Saviour, and the bleſſigs of that "co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant ordered in all things and ſure," lays a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for petition, for pardon of ſin, and deliverance from evils. This Moſes the ſervant of the LORD uſed, when GOD's people were encountering their enemies. Our GOD would have us ſenſible, that we are dependent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him for victory. "Some truſt in chariots, and ſome in horſes, but we will remember the name of the LORD our GOD."</p>
            <p>SINCE Moſes has ſet the example, we may ſafely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine that it will be no diſhonor to the greateſt Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, to join this ſpiritual, with the carnal weapons of warfare. It is only by the LORD that men can tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over enemies.</p>
            <p>IN ſuch faith and practice, fear of man may be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by a chriſtian fear of the LORD of Hoſts, and ſuch may (through grace) ſay with Holy David, "Tho' an hoſt ſhould encamp againſt me, my heart ſhall not fear: Though war ſhould riſe up againſt me, in this will I be confident." Other inſtances of ſanctifying the LORD of Hoſts, are paſſed over.</p>
            <p n="2">II. It is the duty and intereſt of GOD's people to ſanctify him, eſpecially in times of iminent danger. The private centinel, under the wiſeſt and ableſt Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral on earth, is not under ſo powerful obligations, to an implicit obſervation, of general orders, as we are to obey this King of Kings. Upon him we are depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for "life, breath, and all things." The obligation ariſes from the relation God has put us in to him, by creation: All is from him and all due to him; and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:015285_0017_0F9882B33AC257D8"/>
for diſobedience we are holden unto judgment, not meerly the loſs of temporal, but alſo of eternal life. The obligation is renewed upon us, by that gracious act of redemption. "Ye are bought with a price; therefore glorify GOD in your body, and in your ſpirit, which are GOD's."</p>
            <p>ALL the benefits of the new covenant are as ſo many cords binding us. By all theſe "tender mercies of the Lord" are we befought. He is the greateſt benefactor of man: Gratitude calls for it. Man's mouth in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence was filled with arguments for this ſervice. The very ſituation of man in reſpect to the other creatures— Lord over them, as though the great high prieſt, over the lower creation, to offer up a tribute of praiſe on their behalf, points him to this duty; but the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Heaven, committing all power to the "Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of our ſalvation," and the expreſs requirement of it by Iſrael's God, from a covenant people, make all other arguments needleſs.</p>
            <p>IN point of intereſt, this is the only thing that can give ſafety. Real holineſs is the beſt defence. When ſalvation is the walls and bulworks of a people, they muſt be happy. "The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears are open to their cry. The face of the LORD is againſt them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth." When vital piety reigns in the hearts of GOD's people, their light ſhall "break forth as the morning, and their health ſhall ſpring forth ſpeedily; and thy righteouſneſs ſhall go before thee; the glory of the LORD ſhall be thy rere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward" When a man's ways pleaſe the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him. This holy fear of our GOD, is the alone principle, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that of ſtupidity, or carnal ſecurity, or preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that can prevent the fear of man, and of their
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:015285_0018_0F9882B3FB7AE208"/>
threatnings.—Our LORD ever applied this, as the all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſovran remedy againſt the fear of man. "Fear not them that are able to kill the body," &amp;c. When his diſciples were thrown into conſternation, at the thought of his departure; obſerve the cure preſcribed by this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falliable phyſician—"Ye believe in GOD: believe alſo in me." The apoſtles, ſanctifying the Lord in their hearts, poſſeſſed their ſouls in peace. "None of theſe things moved them."—They rejoiced in the LORD, and went on quiet, in the midſt of moſt eminent dangers. This is a certain way to ſecure his protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to obtain dominion over enemies, and to enjoy the real enjoyments of "the glory of all lands." "O that my people had hearkened unto me, and Iſrael had walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my ways! I ſhould ſoon have ſubdued their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and turned my hand againſt their adverſaries. The haters of the LORD ſhould have ſubmitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto him: but their time ſhould have endured forever. He ſhould have fed them alſo with the fineſt of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock ſhould I have ſatisfied thee."</p>

               <p>THE LORD of hoſts is to be ſanctified in the great affair of war: contrary to which, is boaſting at putting on the harneſs; or in caſe of ſucceſs, ſacrificeing "unto their net, and burning incenſe unto their drag," as tho' there was no peculiar preſidency of the LORD of hoſts in the whole affair.</p>
               <p>WHEN nations confederate againſt GOD's profeſſing people, the voice of heaven's king to them is "ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the LORD of hoſts himſelf,"—put your truſt in him, make him your help and ſhield.</p>
               <p>OUR text, in connexion with the context, ſhews us,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:015285_0019_0F9882B4BAD74738"/>
that vital piety, a ſacred regard to juſtice, mercy, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, fidelity, and ſanctity, is the readieſt way to an honourable, and ſafe iſſue, of a war that threatens the very being of a ſtate.</p>
               <p>BESIDES, the view we have taken, of the abſolute dependence, and ſubjection of all created beings, to the will, and direction of the LORD of hoſts, plainly invites us, to make him our father and friend. Then may we boldly ſay, "The LORD is my helper, and I will not fear what man ſhall do unto me."</p>
               <p>SINCE the LORD of hoſts points out ſanctification of his name, as the ſure way to ſalvation, from the power of an enemy; it is lamentable to find gentlemen of the military department, ſo frequently dealing in open profanation of his name; and it is for a lamentation, that our militia, as ſoon as they ſet their faces camp-ward, ſeem to think themſelves ſet free, from all obligation, to reverence the GOD of armies. Is it not for this, that "many have been weak and ſickly among you, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſleep?" The affair of Achan, ſhould teach all chriſtian people, that curſed things are mortal cauſes of defeats.</p>
               <p>THE abounding of wickedneſs, the luſt of inordinate gain, the apparent covetouſneſs, leading men on to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort from, and oppreſs their follow ſervants, becauſe they have it in their power, are doubtleſs ſome of the moral cauſes why the LORD of hoſts ſuffers our enemies, to make ſome parts of our land, which was "as the garden of Eden before them, behind them a deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late wilderneſs."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Finally,</hi> SINCE all created beings, from the higheſt among principalities, and powers in heavenly places, to the loweſt reptile in earth, are under the direction, and

management of the LORD of hoſts; ſee that our ſafety in this militant ſtate ſtands, in nearneſs to GOD, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhadow of the almighty. "Fear not, Abraham: I am thy ſhield, and thy exceeding great reward." The LORD of hoſts has ſet before us a remarkable teſtimony of his diſpleaſure againſt a ſpirit of ſelf-confidence, and vain glorying, from the beginning of this diſpute by arms, both on the one ſide, and the other. Humble ſouls, trembling to ſee this evil ſpirit, have been almoſt able to foretel conſequent defeats, by the abounding confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, of our own and the forces of the enemy. But this I muſt paſs over.</p>
               <p>BRITONS, elate with confidence in martial ſkill, looking down with diſdainful contempt on ſons of America, marched out to Lexington, in all the pride of vain glorying. American annals record the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable morn. Ye fields, be witneſſes of innocent blood,—that firſt opening of the ſluices not yet ſhut. They returned under the influence of a panic, which the LORD of Hoſts ſuffers to fall upon ſelf-ſufficient crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. When our brethren, not yet ſuitably arrang'd, near Charleſtown, took the ground: fierce wafted o'er the Britiſh Legions came, boaſting their intended route through Cambridge, Roxbury and Boſton Neck: like ſheep to the ſlaughter, their road "through the dark valley of the ſhadow of death," oft trod by mortals ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to return, till the arch angel, with the trump of GOD arouſe them. The glory of Britiſh arms was that day tarniſhed. Loud was his voice in providence, "Let not him that putteth on the harneſs boaſt, as he that pulleth it off." May it now be ſpoken without tears, that ſons of America took the diſeaſe?

When lo! in the field, the laſt place where America thought herſelf able to ſpeak to advantage, with the enemy, Britons and Heſſians retreat before us. And now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "how ſlow of heart" to underſtand? Hark from the North, to the noiſe of the ſtrength of our armament upon the Lake, and be ye witneſſes of the confidence of men, in the works of their own hands, to prepare us for the doleful tydings, that almoſt all our armament there is deſtroyed. So true the wiſe man's obſervation, "Pride goeth before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and an haughty ſpirit before a fall." Once more, my hearers, look to the Jerſies, there ſee this obſervation more abundantly verified. Who has not heard of the intended Chriſtmaſs, of Britiſh and Heſſian troops at Philadelphia? When now our troops, through ſhort inliſtments, reduced to an handful, as though to ſhew the finger of GOD; look! behold! the proud boaſters are checked, they retreat, they are as they are. O that chriſtians would conſider, "that when Ephraim ſpoke trembling, he exalted himſelf in Iſrael; but when he offended in Baal, he died." The cure of this evil is before us, "ſanctify ye the LORD of HOSTS himſelf."</p>
               <p>MEN, brethren and fathers, may I preſume upon your patience a few minutes longer, to ſhew you that I have yet to ſpeak on GOD's behalf? Know then, that the rapid progreſs of luxury among us—the exceſſive attachment to imported ſuperfluities— the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of luſt and faſhion, nurſed pride, effeminated the inhabitants, and ſquezed the induſtrious, yea, almoſt forced multitudes to injuſtice, or knavery, or extortion,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:015285_0022_0F9882B6FAB5EC28"/>
to keep pace with the prevailing cuſtom of the times. Nothing ſhort of nonimportation, could recover men to their ſenſes, and bring us to value our flax, wool, and fineſt of the wheat, above baubles. All the teaching and reaſoning of the ableſt among us, backed with the authority of GOD's word, could not avail to arouſe this people out of their lethargy. "Ephraim is joined to idols," and after them he would go. The hard neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of war, and of ſuch a war as dried up the ſtreams of luxury in a great meaſure, muſt force us to induſtry, frugality and oeconomy. The GOD of heaven ſaw it, and this rod of chaſtiſement has he ſtretched out over us. He that ſeeks the moral cauſe of theſe calamities, within two or three years paſt only, levels the arrow far on this ſide the mark. Righteous and diſcerning ones, have long obſerved, that ſome in a land of viſion, had either forgot, or were willingly ignorant," that to do juſtice between man and man, that a ſacred regard to moral obligation, joined to mercy, were eſſential parts of real religion. How many were as little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to pay their juſt debts, as though neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, nor heaven ſtood in any relation to it? What evaſions—what breaches of promiſe—what demuring in courts, and what not? to keep the juſt dues of credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in their own hands, while they laviſhed gold out of the bag, upon luxuries and ſuperfluities: yea, while poor creditors, defrauded of their juſt dues, ſuffered for want of bread. What dependance could be placed upon the promiſes of ſome, if by evading them, they could make a little more profit ſome other way? Is this the character of a citizen of Zion?</p>
               <p>THIS diſregard to juſtice—this failure of moral ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, is the bane of godlineſs. <note n="¶" place="bottom">From one concomitant ſymptom, we have great reaſon to fear, hypocriſy is one of the crying ſins of the preſent day, "<hi>Hypocriſy</hi> commonly uſhers in <hi>prophaneneſs,</hi> and, as a <hi>lad</hi> thruſt in at a window, opens the door to the greateſt monſters: for there is nothing more common, than for men, who are not very diſcerning, to contemn all piety, when they ſee the blackeſt crimes proſecuted under that ſilken mantle, and men, with the <hi>temple of the LORD</hi> in their mouths, abuſe both the <hi>temple,</hi> and the <hi>GOD</hi> that dwells in it." <hi>Harneck's preface to the Great Law of Conſideration.</hi>

judgment, but behold oppreſſion—for righteouſneſs, but behold a cry." If we remember that covetouſneſs is the ſource of this eyil, we may ſee a remarkable ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity between GOD's preſent dealing with us, and his antient people. "For the iniquity of his covetouſneſs was I wroth and ſmote him: I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly, in the way of his heart."</p>
               <p>SHOULD it pleaſe GOD to give us a name among the nations of the earth, it was neceſſary to diſcipline us to frugality, moral honeſty, and ſelf-government; or vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, with a free trade, could no longer dwell among us. When the GOD of Iſrael was about eſtabliſhing them in national ſtate, in a land flowing with "milk and honey," he led them forty years in the wilderneſs, to humble them, and prove them, and know what was in their heart, whether they would keep his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The circumſtances into which he has caſt us, anſwer this purpoſe, at leaſt to prove us, and ſhew us there was ſuch wickedneſs in our hearts, as would ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly diſqualify us for good in our "latter end" un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it were checked, and purged out. May it have the happy effect alſo of humbling us.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Never, perhaps, had any people a greater trial of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and patriotiſm, than Americans now have, in one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inſtance; and it is greatly to be wiſhed that virtue and patriotiſm might triumph over this temptation. The ſcarcity of money, while we were colonies to Britain, and the plenty of European goods, with proviſions of our own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, quick exchanged for an abounding plenty of bills of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, ſcarcity of foreign goods, with a large demand of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions for ſupply of our army; becomes a temptation almoſt too powerful for fleſh and blood. True patriotiſm ſhould teach us, in defiance of the temptation, to maintain the credit of our currency, even though it were but iron or leather, ſtamped with public authority.</note> Who could
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:015285_0024_0F9882B87B7E7BE8"/>
have believed, ten years ago, that men could have been found in this land, who would have taken advantage of a ſcarcity, or of a neighbour's neceſſity, to extort double, yea, thrice the common value of a commodity? Had we cautioned a neighbour againſt ſuch extortion, ten years ago, would he not have ſaid, "Is thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant a dog, that he ſhould do this great thing?" Yet how many ſuch have been found? <note n="§" place="bottom">The preacher does not imagine the ſin of covetouſneſs ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges at this day, ſo much above what it has in years paſt, as the price of goods is enhanced. The peculiar circumſtances of the day, afford abundant occaſion for manifeſtation of this ſin. The enhanced price of goods, proceeds at leaſt, in a great meaſure, from other cauſes. Engroſſing and monopoliſing, are juſtly chargeable to this evil diſeaſe; but would have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in paſt times, had circumſtances favoured them, as now.</note> Who could have thought, that while we were complaining of oppreſſion, and have ſo univerſally judged it right to withdraw ourſelves from the domination of Britain, on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; ſo many ſhould be found guilty of this ſin, which endangers us more than all the armies of Britain? Are theſe ſons of liberty? Are they not rather ſlaves of luſt? For of whom a man is overcome, of the ſame is he brought into bondage. Surely, in regard to their ſoul's ſalvation, they may as well be the ſlaves of other men's luſts, as of their own. To theſe, add engroſſers
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:015285_0025_0F9882B9417CEF88"/>
and monopolizers, the canker worms of a community, which deſtroy the fair fruits of the tree of liberty.</p>
               <p>WHEN now upon tryal, we ſee what wickedneſs has been, and ſtill is in the hearts of ſome: can we wonder that "his anger is not turned away, but his hand is ſtretched out ſtill?" O that ſuch would remember, and practiſe that apoſtolic command "Look not every man on his own things, but every man alſo on the things of others." This public virtue is as neceſſary for the well being of a ſtate, as private virtue is for the exiſtence of a chriſtian: "but the rod hath bloſſomed, and pride," with covetouſneſs "hath budded;" yea, brought forth the bitter fruit. With foreign commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities imported into our populous, maritime towns, have come men, whoſe religion may be ſummed up in this ſhort creed, "Gain is godlineſs." The importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of foreign luxury, cultivated by men of this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; to which you may add, cargoes of convicts emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied like jakes upon us, bid fair to nurſe up a race of infidels.</p>
               <p>A BELIEF of the being of GOD, and of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential government, is the foundation principle, without which there can be no religion. To this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation principle, our GOD ſeems to be calling us. Where is his ſuperintending influence more manifeſt, than in the great affair of war? To what but his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence can we attribute it, that an army ſo great with an artillery ſo immenſe, with a navy ſufficient to defy all we can do, have made no greater inroads upon us? If GOD had not done more for us than we have done for ourſelves, what would our caſe have been! Infidels, henceforth caſt away your infidelity, and join with us to ſanctify the LORD of HOSTS himſelf, and let him be your fear, let him be your dread.</p>

               <p>UNDER the accumulated burdens, which devolve up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Honor, the only one among thirteen governors, whom the love of his people—of his country—religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and liberty, have perſuaded, not fearing the wrath of the king, to riſk life and character, to live honorably, or die with the liberty of your country; pecuniary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations are no adequate compenſation for the inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant fatigues of office.</p>
               <p>THERE are, indeed, many motives to a patient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in well-doing—that you may deſerve an honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able rank among your many worthy predeceſſors in office —that you may appear really worthy of the place GOD in his providence has placed you in—firſt Governor in this free and independent State of America—that you may continue to deſerve the approbation of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituents—that you may promote your country's welfare —that you may obtain the teſtimony of your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, reſpecting fidelity in theſe. But, Sir, is there one conſideration that can give you more ſatisfaction, than the teſtimony of conſcience, that you have ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the LORD of HOSTS himſelf, and made him your fear and dread, and have uſed your influence to engage the numerous bands under your command, to follow your example.</p>
               <p>THE good pleaſure of the MOST HIGH, in chooſing and placing your Honor in ſuch a peculiar ſituation— laſt Governor of the Colony of Connecticut—firſt in this free and independent State; where labours indeed, have been more abundant;—raiſing you up for this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

purpoſe, and girding your loins, to go through the work which, in its conſequences, may have connexion with the happineſs of unborn multitudes, even through eternity, may well excite gratitude to your great Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who has thought fit to employ you in ſo great and honorable ſervice. This thought was in the mind of St. Paul; "And I thank CHRIST JESUS, our LORD, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the miniſtry." This will not ſail to raiſe your mind above the toils of mortal life, while you have a conſciouſneſs of integrity, aiming at the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the great ſupreme over all.</p>
               <p>THE pleaſing thought that your Honor's name will ſtand inroll'd in the annals of America, among the firſt of her worthies, who live at this important criſis, has the LORD of hoſts allowed you, as a ballance for the far more exceeding labours and fatigues that attend this day of America's tribulation. This, in regard to earthly honors, is thy portion from the LORD.</p>
               <p>LET thoſe who have not learn'd to extend their views beyond pecuniary emoluments, and fulſome adulation, feaſt upon the ſmiles of earthly monarchs, and ſtretch themſelves on beds of ivory; but more ſubſtantial joys be thy portion.</p>
               <p>IT was ſpoken to the praiſe of the angel of the church of Thyatyra, "I know thy works, and charity, and ſervice, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the laſt to be more than the firſt." Works done in love to GOD<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and man, ſervice done, in faith, patience, and works abounding more at laſt than firſt, will not fail of a reward. The well grounded expectation of this, affords a moſt animating ſupport. May your Honor's life be ſpared—your uſefulneſs be increaſed—your loins be girded to go through the work which GOD in his providence allots you, and your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in contemplating the connxion which your labours

               </opener>
               <p>IN as much as civil inſtitutions, are a ſubſtitute for loſt innocence, uſed by GOD to curb the violent paſſions of men, and conſtrain them to regard righteouſneſs, and ſocial virtues: The work allotted to you, Gentlemen, in your legiſlative character, is very ſerious, ſolemn, and important; and ever ought to be entered upon, with a becoming ſenſe of accountableneſs to him, whoſe is the kingdom. Permit me firſt to ſay with due de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, "Worſhip him all ye gods." Nothing can better quality you for this important ſervice, than ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive knowledge, joined to the fear of the LORD. Be entreated to bear in your minds; the great ends of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, even to reform the morals of the ſubject. GOD has called you to be "ſtrong rods," to correct the wicked; or in St. Paul's words, to be "the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of GOD, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil." In this view ye are miniſters of GOD for good to his people, conſtraining them by civil rules to "walk honeſtly as in the day." The ſecurity of property by righteous ordinances, and protection of the ſubject, in lawful and uſeful employments, gives them opportunity, to "lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſs and honeſty." To which end, righteouſneſs ſhould be the baſis of law—an additional force to the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:015285_0029_0F9882BC40DA8D38"/>
dictates of well informed conſcience. The obligation of the ruled to obey, ſhould ſeldom depend ſolely upon, "<hi>Be it enacted,</hi> &amp;c." Men may feel the force of law by it's penalty; but will not be formed to virtue by ſuch ordinances.</p>
               <p>GOD's ſervants in authority, ſhould imitate him "all whoſe ways are judgment;" who ſpeaks "in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs." America groaning under the moſt barbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous treatment—condemned, unheard—her children pronounced rebels, when in the peace of GOD and the king—praying for the welfare of the king, and nation: ſentenced to be dragged away in chains to Britain, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuſpicion of crimes:—troops let looſe upon us, ſheathing their ſwords in the bowels of them, whoſe honeſt induſtry fed great numbers in the Britiſh iſle: loudly calls upon you, to form laws in righteouſneſs, conſonant to the mild and equitable government of Zion's King, One great deſign among others is, by civil ordinances to lead men to reverence, and honor the GOD's among men: that their minds being habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated to reverence ſuperiors, may be prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and ſanctify the LORD of HOSTS. Therefore, it becomes very important for you, to maintain your authority, and the dignity of law:—to ſee that no laws be trampled upon with impunity:—that there be no <hi>formido avium</hi>: that fines and penalties be duly exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is no mercy to a community, to uſe exceſs of lenity towards tranſgreſſors. Great is the importance of having executive officers faithful, to put into exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution the good laws of the State. Is there not a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency here? Why does profane ſwearing abound, while there are good and wholeſome laws to ſuppreſs it? Why are the ſabbaths of the LORD profaned, and ſo little notice taken of offenders? Why ſo few proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions upon the late law againſt oppreſſion, when there are known <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

taken of offenders? Such neglects, deſtroy the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of authority, and teach men to deſpiſe dominion, and ſpeak evil of dignities; the morals of the people are hereby corrupted, while the hands of rulers are weakened, and one of the great ends of government fruſtrated. What other meaſures ought to be taken, to ſtir up under officers to faithfulneſs, and to revive antient zeal for the ſupport of authority, belongs to the civil department to determine.</p>
               <p>IF there is a defect here, may not lovers of order and virtue believe, that the zeal and watchful care of this honorable body, will ſoon quicken the ſlothful, and ſupport the faithful?</p>
               <p>AS the religion of our bleſſed LORD is the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat ſyſtem of morality, ever yet taught in our world, beſt calculated to render men good ſubjects of civil ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety: ſo it claims the ſupport of a chriſtian magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. All who profeſs a belief of the being of one GOD —the Meſſiahſhip of JESUS of NAZARETH—the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the ſaving influences of the Holy Spirit, and that the "lively oracles" of the old and new teſtament, are the revealed will of GOD, the appointed rule of faith and manners; have a juſt claim to protection from the magiſtrate. To require ſuch to ſupport this ſyſtem of morality, for the benefit of civil community, is no more abſurd, than to require them to ſupport ſchools of education, to render youths good members of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. <note n="†" place="bottom">Arguments for religious eſtabliſhments, ſhould ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground of morality. This takes the plea of conſcience out of the mouths of particular ſects. Such as openly plead, that it is againſt their conſciences, to ſupport morality for the good of civil community, forfeit all claim to the benefit of law and protection.</note>
               </p>
               <p>EVERY religious ſect, within the above deſcription,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:015285_0031_0F9882BDC0580EF8"/>
ought to enjoy a due proportion of the expence they contribute, for the ſupport of this ſyſtem, to employ if they pleaſe, teachers of it, according to their own tenets; but if they refuſe to uſe it this way, may it not become the civil power to ſet it apart, to the ſupport of morality in the education of youths, or ſome other way?</p>
               <p>WHILE your attention is drawn to the "battle of the warrior—and garments rolled in blood;" there is not a little danger of neglecting the arts of peace. The neceſſity of education, to the very being of a free go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, is ſhewn by the author of America's Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Impartial World, <note n="*" place="bottom">

To ſolicit a benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of a pecuniary kind, for the muſes at this time, when there are ſuch abundant demands, for immediate defence; might appear inconſiderate. The ſmiles of this body, in every reaſonable way, "will be as the light of the morning, when the ſun riſeth; even a morning without clouds;" a ſtrengthening of free go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, therefore to be deſired, by all lovers of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, knowledge, education, and true liberty. Are not theſe inſtances within your department, in which ye may ſanctify the LORD of Hoſts, and influence others alſo? May your hearts be inclined to ariſe up and do the work, and the LORD give you wiſdom and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in theſe things.</p>

But at a day, when providence, and our country call every one to exert themſelves, who durſt withold their beſt endeavours? The work GOD has allotted to us, to be inſtruments in his hands, to lead men to ſanctify the LORD GOD in their hearts, is truly great, excellent and divine. This, ſtanding in connexion with the deſign of civil magiſtracy, ought to unite our hearts and hands with them, in preparing a people for the LORD. Moſes and Aaron ſhould walk hand in hand; and duty demands our prayers for them. The viſible ſins of the day, prophaneneſs, hypocriſy, gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs of gain—the want of public virtue and moral honeſty; ought not to eſcape our notice, in our paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral labours. I need not mind you, that to us it belongs to teach the pure doctrines of the goſpel, with uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptneſs, gravity and ſincerity—to urge the neceſſity of regeneration by the ſpirit of GOD—of juſtification freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in JESUS CHRIST—to preſs goſpel motives to holineſs, with the precious promiſe of aſſiſtance here, and immortal life in the heavenly world; with the terrors of the LORD, to awaken the careleſs and ſecure; and all with an humble ſenſe of the utter impotency of men and means, without GOD's bleſſing.

That boaſting at putting on the harneſs, which had ſuch a run laſt year, would, unchecked, render us offenſive to GOD, and intolerable to men. The LORD of HOSTS found a way to humble us.

don't produce repentence, let mercy in judgment, bring you to ingenuous ſorrow for your tranſgreſſions.</p>
               <p>THROUGH undeſerved mercy, GOD's conduct has hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been, towards us, as it was towards Iſrael, in the days of Jehoahaz; when they were oppreſſed by Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zael king of Syria. "And the LORD was gracious to them, and had compaſſion on them, and had reſpect unto them; becauſe of his covenant with Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob, and would not deſtroy them, neither caſt he them from his preſence as yet."</p>
               <p>WHY if GOD had written Lo-ammi upon us, did he not withhold the bleſſing of fullneſs in the latter harveſt? Why were not the enemy ſuffered to over-run all theſe States? Why were our brethren victorious at Charleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town in South-Carolina? Why did GOD ſuffer that ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſupply of powder to fall into our hands, by the brave Capt. MUGFORD? (whom we could have wiſhed a better fate.) Why was the manufacture of Salt-Petre brought to perfection in a few months: by which two favours our privateers were enabled to afford ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of Weſt-India goods, and much cloathing? Why have we been favored with ſucceſs near Harlem—at Trenton and Princetown, and the enemy driven back? Theſe things ſhould ſupport our minds under the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, and animate us to amend every thing that is amiſs. The language of GOD to his people once was, "You only have I known of all the families of the earth: Therefore will I puniſh you for all your iniquities." Let us then open our "ears to diſcipline," and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teintly accept this puniſhment upon this family which has been near to GOD. "Break off your ſins by righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and" your "iniquities, by ſhewing mercy to the poor." Then GOD will find other employment for your enemies. But if this people are reſolved to walk each one after the ſight of his own eyes, and in the imagination of his own heart, and ſay, "we are

delivered to do all theſe abominations," behold the feet of them who have waſted towns, and pilaged the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, are at the door!</p>
