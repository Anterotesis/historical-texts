         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE kind reception <hi>the Pleaſing Inſtructor</hi> has met with in general, ſince its firſt publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, merits the Editor's moſt ſincere and hearty thanks. In this edition, many additions and amendments are made, which, it is hoped, will meet with approbation. Several original eſſays, by a friend, are inſerted, which, in the table of contents, are marked <hi>Anon. Engliſh</hi> mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos are prefixed to the eſſays; and care has been taken to inſert ſuch <hi>only</hi> as are <hi>conciſe, appoſite,</hi> and <hi>ſtriking,</hi> that they may have the <hi>better</hi> effect on the minds of youth.</p>
            <p>The reader will be kind enough to obſerve, that <hi>the Pleaſing Inſtructor</hi> was at firſt chiefly undertaken, and ſince continued, with a view to exhibit a <hi>connected plan</hi> of <hi>morality</hi> for the inſtruction of the youth of both ſexes, and free from that incoherent jumble ſo remarkable in all collections of this kind which have hitherto been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed. The <hi>Utile Dulci</hi> has been conſulted, and <hi>morality</hi> here appears ſmiling, and free from that unpleaſing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality with which ſhe is too often diſguiſed by partial, or miſtaken pedants. The ſeveral relations, Eaſtern ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, dreams, &amp;c. will, it is to be hoped, be recommended to young minds, whoſe attentions are thereby particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly engaged, and, by the aſſiſtance of which, <hi>morality</hi> ſteals inſenſibly into their good graces, and makes the moſt laſting impreſſion: The moſt elegant writers have been conſulted by the Editor; ſo that the young reader, by being converſant with the following eſſays, will, at the ſame time, acquire a true taſte of an caſe and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance in his native tongue; an accompliſhment too much neglected by the teachers of youth, who ſeldom look on it as an improvement ſo abſolutely neceſſary as it really is. And though the entertainment and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of youth, at an <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſchool, were principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in the firſt publication of this book, yet the Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor has had the pleaſure to find it ſince honored with the attention and approbation of thoſe more advanced in years, and ſelected by the polite and judicious through-out the kingdom, inſomuch that it has now acquired a place in almoſt every parlour window.</p>

            <head>THOUGHTS ON EDUCATION, BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>THOUGH EDUCATION be a ſubject that almoſt all Authors, of all ages, have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon; yet many have attempted it who were ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, perhaps, to the moſt extenſive definition of the WORD; others have laid down very plauſible rules and ſyſtems for it, which, upon experience, have been found impracticable; while others have obliged the world with ſuch valuable and plain plans, that any thinking man muſt be apt to wonder how they ſhould have been miſſed or neglected; yet theſe able writers have, to ignorant and undiſcerning pretenders, planned and planned in vain: from which it may plainly he inferred, that differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent paſſions and diſpoſitions require different manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and application, to ſo endleſs a variety, that it is merely impoſſible to enumerate methods for the proper correction of every enormity in every human mind, or to lay down rules for the beſt incitements to, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements of virtue and ſcience; ſo that the main point, after all their preſcriptions, muſt neceſſarily cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the tutors or governors of ſchools and ſeminaries. Much learning and great abilities, (though material articles) are not the only eſſentials; he who has the moſt learning does not always convey it in the beſt and cleareſt manner to others: ſome cannot or will not be at the pains to find out particular methods (where gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral ones fail) to render what they would communicate intelligible to the various capacities of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; nor do learning and knowledge always center in the ſame perſon. Uſeful knowledge, or what I would have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended

by the word politeneſs,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>"To define politeneſs, we may ſay, it is all moral virtues in epitome: it is a combination of diſcretion, civility, complaiſance, and circumſpection, to pay every one the reſpect they have a right to demand of us; beſides, an exact knowledge of decorum, and of what every one owes to his reſpective quality, dule to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his character as becomes him. And all this muſt be dreſſed and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </note> is the grand mark or ſummit of education we ſhould aim at; learning, as a famous author has expreſſed himſelf, "is but the vehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle that carries us to it."</p>
            <p>An auſtere or learned pedant has ſometimes whipped Latin, Greek, &amp;c. into a lad, whoſe very diſguſt to it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed perhaps with the acquiſition thereof: but it is a manifeſt abſurdity to maintain or imagine that any one can be awed into a love of learning and virtue. A boy is not at all cured of a fault, who only avoids it for fear of puniſhment: he muſt be influenced by a love for honour and credit, and with a laudable ambition to purſue them: any maſter, who is himſelf a <hi>good</hi> and <hi>diſcerning</hi> man, will not be much at a loſs how to confirm and ratify him in his choice, being capacitated as a good man, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to him the ſecret impulſes, the benign reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his own honeſt, and therefore happy mind; as a diſcerning man, to obſerve and remark to him what wild havoc and varied deſolation, vice and folly never fail to bring on their votaries; which may be clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, either by living examples among their acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances, or from books, by ſimilar relations, allegories, or eſſays, (ſuch as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> inſerted in this collection) applied at proper times on proper occaſions, judiciouſly explained, and wiſely inculcated: But an <hi>ill</hi> man, though ever ſo learned, can never be a good ſchoolmaſter; it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible he ſhould, with a due ſenſibility, deſcribe or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force impulſes of goodneſs he does not feel, or demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to others with clearneſs and impartiality the effects of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:029518_0004_0FE1BA27986BA5E0"/>
are contradictions to them: Therefore a bad man, in the point of education, muſt miſcarry, and even a good man may; for as no man ought to be well bred (if a man can be well bred) at the expence of religion and virtue; ſo neither ought any man to practiſe them in ſo moroſe and ſurly a manner, as to deter others from imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I ſhall endeavour to explain myſelf yet more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the two following characters, which I ſhall repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent by the names of <hi>Candidus</hi> and <hi>Denuncius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Candidus</hi> is a man of extenſive learning, has an exact knowledge of human nature, a great experience of the world, and of thoſe differences which reſult from conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, age, received opinions, external fortune, education, cuſtom, and converſation; manages the tempers of his pupils with undeſcribeable artfulneſs, ſo conſequently can adapt or addreſs his admonitions or inſtructions to the moſt ſalutary ends, be his ſcholars ever ſo numerous,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>By numerous, is not meant here many ſcholars at once, but at various times; as perhaps no man can to perfection teach more than twelve or fourteen at a time.</hi>
               </note> or their diſpoſitions ever ſo various.</p>
            <p>As for the qualities of his mind, he is mild, humane, affable, affectionate, and even invitingly acceſſible; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging his pupils in the diſplay of all their little doubts, queries, and divided opinions; teaching them, at the ſame time, not to perſiſt in an opinion, &amp;c. becauſe they had once avowed it; but to come frankly into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction; and would frankly, with a condeſcending bow, ſmile, &amp;c. thank a ſcholar for any little officious ſervices or intended obligations; nay, frequently apologize, or aſk pardon, for any omiſſion, miſtake, miſapprehenſion, or ſimilar modes of behaviour; ſuch as frequently occur among the beſt bred and polite; and thus by being treated as men, they become emulous of being ſuch. Familiarities in a tyrant are obſerved to beget contempt; in <hi>him</hi> reſpect and gratitude; for as he has not even a thought that is ambitious, wrong, or malicious, he never was or can be ſeen by them in a little, mean, or ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous light; but his whole conduct is the living object of their imitation. Thus, as his character is uniform, his temper ſerene and ſteady, the influence acquired in his ſchool is unlimited: he applauds with ſo much pleaſure,

<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:029518_0004_0FE1BA27986BA5E0"/>
and reproves with ſo much tender concern and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they love him as a parent. So conſtantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout and fervent in the duties of religion and morality, that they reverence him as a ſaint, and conſider him as a Mentor: they are awed by his virtues, not by his ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities; and by a conſtant attention to his doctrine, exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified in his own life, his pupils frequently acquire "ſuch a conviction of the conſciouſneſs of a Deity to all their thoughts, that every inordinate wiſh becomes ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly ſuppreſſed by the moſt ſcrupulous circumſpection."</p>
            <p>Such is the amiable <hi>Candidus,</hi> and ſuch the engaging and ſucceſsful methods he makes uſe of,
<q>
                  <l>—To rear the tender thought,</l>
                  <l>To teach the young idea how to ſhoot,</l>
                  <l>To pour the freſh inſtructions o'er the mind,</l>
                  <l>To breathe th' enliv'ning ſpirit, and to fix</l>
                  <l>The gen'rous purpoſe in the glowing breaſt.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Denuncius</hi> too is a man of learning, but not ſo remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for his learning as the oſtentation of it: therefore knowledge he cannot have much of, becauſe if he had, he would ſee ſo much weakneſs even in the perfection of human reaſon, that he would in conſequence deſpiſe, not be proud of, his own miſerable pittance: watching and aſſiſting the openings of little minds, enlarging their ideas, ſowing the ſeeds of goodneſs, or weeding out enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, though very eſſential points, are yet ſuch as he is equally ignorant and unconcerned about, wanting that neceſſary diſcernment to deduce the actions of men to their minuteſt ſources, or to infer conſequences from their manners or actions; but his incapacity in this is not the leaſt obſtruction to his general acceptation, which my wiſeſt readers will, on firſt thoughts, wonder at; but then let them conſider, that there are hundreds of parents who can judge of a lad's advancement in founds, ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, words, or languages, who are utterly incapable of diſcerning the enlargement of his mental faculties, and their wonder will ceaſe. I have obſerved before, that he is vain and oſtentatious: I ſhould have added, paſſionate, pedantic, arrogant, moroſe, and ill-natured; the natural produce of a narrow and ignorant mind. As paſſionate, he frequently oppoſes commotion with commotion; ſo that his ſcholars look upon his ſeverities as revenge, or the gratification of his own conteſting humour, not the
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:029518_0005_0FE1CBAB3384E378"/>
neceſſary correction of their faults. His paſſion too drives him to ſuch lengths, as often ſubjects him to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due conceſſions, ſo that he deſtroys the authority and order of his ſchool by his very endeavours to preſerve them: in ſhort, as his behaviour in ſchool is exactly the reverſe to that of <hi>Candidus,</hi> ſo are its effects; for <hi>Denuncius</hi> is as heartily ridiculed and deſpiſed, as the other is rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erenced and beloved. While their boys, though perhaps with the equal approbation of their ſeveral parents, leave their reſpective ſchools with this difference, i. e. The inſtructions and example of <hi>Candidus</hi> having diſpell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from before his pupils the miſt of ignorance, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled them to ſee clearly and judge infallibly of the merits and demerits of good and evil, and of the natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences thereof, his young men are thereby enabled to guard againſt all incitements to the viſionary pleaſure of guilty life, and to ſteer their courſe with ſecurity and credit through the world: whereas thoſe of <hi>Denuncius,</hi> not having had their ſenſes and reaſoning faculties exerciſed, or their judgment cultivated, but tyrannized into implicit obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and perhaps into an irreparable meanneſs, abject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſlaviſhneſs of ſpirit, ſally forth into action, and the wide world at random; ignorant of the roads that lead to true honour and happineſs, and unapprized of the latent dangers of vice and error, till perhaps they are ſurpriſed, ſwallowed up, or otherwiſe undone by their conſequences.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the reverſeneſs of theſe two charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, they are almoſt always miſerably confounded by the undiſcerning world, who are ever liable to be deceived by falſe appearances. Narrow reſerve, and pedantic mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſeneſs have paſſed for ſound wiſdom and profound diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion: Inſtructors of youth have degenerated into the corruptors and depravers of it; authority into tyranny, and ſubmiſſion into ſlavery: hence it is, that the moſt deſpicable and worthleſs pretenders have put up for that veneration and eſteem, only due to men of ability and worth; and oftener men of ability and worth have been obliged to ſhare the contempt due to knaves and dunces by this means, the moſt laudable and honourable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion in the world, i. e. the inſtructing of youth, is eſteemed mean, dependent, and ſervile; and thus, in far more inſtances than immediately relate to my purpoſe,

            <p>Grammatical learning is at preſent, perhaps, too much out of faſhion, eſpecially among the ladies. Moſt of our Engliſh Grammars are ſo dependent upon the Latin, that they appear only tranſlations of them, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing many needleſs perplexities; as ſuperfluous caſes, genders, moods, tenſes, &amp;c. peculiarities which our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is exempt from: therefore it muſt proceed from ignorance or parade in any ſchoolmaſter, to teach or pretend much advantage therefrom, to a mere Engliſh ſcholar; and it is owing to this ignorance or unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful pretence, that Engliſh Grammar is ſo much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, or ſo lightly eſteemed as it is, even amongſt men of learning; though it is generally allowed, that none can ſpeak or write properly who are ignorant of Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar: therefore it becomes neceſſary that a practical Engliſh Grammar<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>See Fiſher's Engliſh Grammar.</hi>
               </note> ſhould be conſiſtent with itſelf, and independent of the Latin, except in ſuch articles as are common to both.</p>
            <p>People can never diſplay their talents to much advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, either in writing or converſation, unleſs they have a taſte for the beauty and propriety of their mother tongue; and which they can never have, without learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, ſo as to know the nature and kinds of words, with their connections and dependencies upon one another. That many women read much, and yet not to edification, is chiefly becauſe they are ignorant of theſe connections and dependencies, and thereby apply relatives to wrong antecedents, verbs to wrong names, particularly where there is a genitive caſe between a nominative word and the verb; miſtake things for perſons, and perſons for things, and are thereby miſled in the ſenſe of what they are about to trace, eſpecially in circumſtantial authors, or ſuch as the generality call dark and obſcure writers, meaning thoſe who, by tranſpoſition, &amp;c. deviate from the general order of the language: they feel an entangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though they know not what or where, and are equally blind to the beauties and idioms of language. I could eaſily exemplify this, but it would be tedious to
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:029518_0006_0FE1CBB996A05FA8"/>
demonſtrate it to thoſe who know nothing of government or conſtruction, and needleſs to thoſe who do, and have ever experienced the want of it in others.</p>
            <p>Women being thus left lame in their learning, are in a great meaſure incapable of further improving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſpite of all the pains that writers have taken, or may take, till the obſtacle be removed: and ſtill to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate the caſe, they are moſtly put to ſewing, or ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilar articles under the care of ſome miſtreſs, who is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps either utterly incapable of aſſiſting them in the purſuit of knowledge, or who, from a crowd of ſcholars, wants time to point out, or explain to them, ſuch places or ſubjects of books as are beſt adapted to their ſeveral wants, or even to direct them in the choice of books. Others there are who have not a book in their ſchools, or ſuch only as are no way ſuitable for youth. Theſe impediments are very lamentable, eſpecially as they oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in the very nick of time a young lady ſhould be taught to think, reflect, and form a taſte of life in.</p>
            <p>I do not mean to recommend <hi>reading</hi> at the expence of <hi>ſewing;</hi> but would only make a principle of the former. There are ſeveral governeſſes, doubtleſs, who are very capable of inſtructing young ladies in both, which would form an agreeable variety, by relaxing or relieving them from one by the other.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who have no taſte for intellectual amuſements, will ſeize upon the next thing at hand, be it of ever ſo light or fantaſtical a kind. "A love for diverſions, where it has once got footing, ſteals on perſons inſenſibly, till it engroſſes their whole time: it therefore becomes neceſſary to get the ſtart of it, and prepoſſeſs them early with a love of books."</p>

               <p>WHEN <hi>Hercules,</hi> ſays the divine <hi>Prodicus,</hi> was in that part of his youth in which it was natural for him to conſider what courſe of life he ought to purſue, he one day retired into a deſart, where the ſilence and ſolitude of the place very much favoured his meditations. As he was muſing on his preſent condition, and very much perplexed in himſelf on the ſtate of life he ſhould chuſe, he ſaw two women of a larger ſize than ordinary approaching towards him. One of them had a very not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able air, and graceful deportment; her beauty was nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural and eaſy; her perſon clean and unſpotted; her eyes caſt towards the ground, with an agreeable reſerve; her motion and behaviour full of modeſty; and her raiment white as ſnow.—The other had a great deal of health and floridneſs in her countenance, which ſhe had helped with an artificial white and red, and endeavoured to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more graceful than ordinary in her mein, by a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

               </p>
               <p>By this time the other lady was come up, who addreſſed herſelf to the young hero is a very different manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hercules.</hi> (ſays ſhe) I offer myſelf to you becauſe I know you are deſcended from the gods, and give proofs of that deſcent, by your love of virtue, and application to the ſtudies proper for your age.

Deity, you muſt be at the pains of worſhipping him: if the friendſhip of good men, you muſt ſtudy to oblige them; if you would be honoured by your country, you muſt take care to ſerve it. In ſhort, if you would be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inent in war or peace, you muſt become maſter of all the qualifications that can make you ſo. Theſe are the only terms and conditions upon which I can propoſe happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The goddeſs of Pleaſure here broke in upon her diſcourſe: you ſee, (ſaid ſhe) <hi>Hercules,</hi> by her own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, the way to her pleaſure is long and difficult, whereas that which I propoſe is ſhort and eaſy. Alas! (ſaid the other lady, whoſe viſage glowed with a paſſion made up of ſcorn and pity) what are the pleaſures you propoſe? To eat before you are hungry, drink be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you are thirſty, ſleep before you are tired, to gratify appetites before they are raiſed, and raiſe ſuch appetites as nature never planted. You never heard the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious muſic, which is the praiſe of one's ſelf; nor ſaw the moſt beautiful object, which is the work of one's own hands. Your votaries paſs away their youth in a dream of miſtaken pleaſure, while they are hoarding up anguiſh, torment, and remorſe for old age.</p>
               <p>As for me, I am the friend of the gods and of good men, an agreeable companion of the artiſan, an houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold guardian to the fathers of families, a patron and protector of ſervants, and an aſſociate in all true and generous friendſhip. The banquets of my votaries are never coſtly, but always delicious; for none eat and drink at them who are not invited by hunger and thirſt. Their ſlumbers are ſound, and their wakings are cheerful. My young men have the pleaſure of hearing themſelves praiſed by thoſe who are in years, and thoſe who are in years, of being honoured by thoſe who are young. In a word, my followers are favoured by the gods, beloved by their acquaintances, eſteemed by their country, and (after the cloſe of their labours) honoured by poſterity.</p>
               <p>We know, by the life of this memorable hero, to which of theſe two ladies he gave up his heart; and, I believe, every one who reads this, will do him the juſtice to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove his choice.</p>
               <p>I very much admire the ſpeeches of theſe ladies, as containing in them the chief arguments for a life of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, or a life of pleaſure, that could enter into the

thoughts of an Heathen; but am particularly pleaſed with the different figures he gives the two goddeſſes. Our modern authors have repreſented pleaſure and vice with an alluring face, but ending in ſnakes and monſters. Here ſhe appears in all the charms of beauty, though they are falſe and borrowed; and by that means compoſe a viſion entirely natural and pleaſing.</p>
               <p>I have tranſlated this allegory for the benefit of youth; and particularly of thoſe who are ſtill in the deplorable ſtate of non-exiſtence, and whom I moſt earneſtly intreat to come into the world. Let my embrios ſhew the leaſt inclination to any ſingle virtue, and I ſhall allow it to be ſtruggling towards birth. I do not expect of them, that, like the hero in the foregoing ſtory, they ſhould go about as ſoon as they are born, with a club in their hands, and a lion's ſkin on their ſhoulders, to root out monſters, and deſtroy tyrants: but as the fineſt author of all antiquity has ſaid upon this very occaſion, Though a man has not the abilities to diſtinguiſh himſelf in the moſt ſhining parts of a great character, he has certainly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>IDLENESS is ſo general a diſtemper, that I cannot but imagine a ſpeculation on this ſubject will be of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal uſe. There is hardly any one perſon without ſome alloy of it; and thouſands beſides myſelf ſpend more time in an idle uncertainty, whether of two affairs to begin firſt, than would have been ſufficient to have ended them both. The occaſion of this ſeems to be the want of ſome neceſſary employment to put the ſpirits in motion, and to awaken them out of their lethargy. If I had leſs leiſure, I ſhould have more; for I ſhould then find time diſtinguiſhed into portions, ſome for buſineſs, and others for the indulging of pleaſures: but now one face of indolence overſpreads the whole, and I have no land mark to direct myſelf by. Were one's time a little ſtraitened by buſineſs, like water incloſed in its banks, it
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:029518_0008_0FE1CBBE15A8B168"/>
would have ſome determined courſe; but unleſs it be put into ſome channel, it has no current, but becomes a del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uge without either uſe or motion.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Scanderberg,</hi> Prince of <hi>Epirus,</hi> was dead, the <hi>Turks,</hi> who had but too often felt the force of his arm in the battles he had won from them, imagined, that by wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a piece of his bones near their hearts, they ſhould be animated with a vigour and force like that which inſpired him when living. As I am like to be but of little uſe while I live, I am reſolved to do what good I can after my deceaſe; and have accordingly ordered my bones to be diſpoſed of in this manner for the good of my country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who are troubled with too exorbitant a degree of fire. All fox-hunters, upon wearing me, would in a ſhort time be brought to endure their bed in a morning, and perhaps even quit them with regret at ten: inſtead of hurrying away to teaze a poor animal, and run away from their own thoughts, a chair or a chariot would be thought the moſt deſirable means of performing a remove from one place to another. I ſhould be a cure for the unnatural deſire of <hi>John <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </hi> for dancing, and a ſpecific to leſſen the inclination Mrs. <hi>Fidget</hi> has to motion, and cauſe her always to give her approbation to the preſent place ſhe is in. In fine, no <hi>Egyptian</hi> Mummy was ever half ſo uſeful in phyſic, as I ſhould be to thoſe feveriſh conſtitutions, to repreſs the violent follies of youth, and to give to each action its proper weight and repoſe.</p>
               <p>I can ſtifle any violent inclination, and oppoſe a torrent of anger, or the ſolicitations of revenge, with ſucceſs. But indolence is a ſtream which flows ſlowly on, but yet undermines the foundation of every virtue. A vice of a more lively nature were a more deſirable tyrant than this ruſt of the mind, which gives a tincture of its nature to every action of one's life. It were as little hazard to be toſſed in a ſtorm, as to lie thus perpetually becalmed: and it is to no purpoſe to have within one the ſeeds of a thouſand good qualities, if we want the vigour and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion neceſſary for exerting them. Death brings all perſons back to an equality; and this image of it, this ſlumber of the mind, leaves no difference between the greateſt genius and the meaneſt underſtanding: a faculty of doing things remarkably praiſe worthy thus concealed, is of no more uſe to the owner than a heap of gold to a man who dares not uſe it.</p>

To-morrow is ſtill the fatal time when all is to be recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: to-morrow comes, it goes, and ſtill I pleaſe myſelf with the ſhadow whilſt I loſe the reality; unmindful that the preſent time alone is ours, the future is yet unborn, and the paſt is dead, and can only live (as parents in their children) in the actions it has produced.</p>
               <p>The time we live ought not to be computed by the number of years, but by the uſe which has been made of it; thus, it is not the extent of ground, but the yearly rent which gives the value to the eſtate. Wretched and thoughtleſs creatures, in the only place where covetouſneſs were a virtue, we turn prodigals! Nothing lies upon our hands with ſuch uneaſineſs; nor has there been ſo many devices for any one thing, as to make it ſlide away imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptibly and to no purpoſe. A ſhilling ſhall be hoarded up with care, whilſt that which is above the price of an eſtate is flung away with diſregard and contempt. There is nothing now a-days ſo much avoided as a ſolicitous improvement of every part of time; it is a report that muſt be ſhunned as one tenders the name of a wit and a fine genius, and as one fears the dreadful character of a laborious prodder: but notwithſtanding this, the greateſt wits any age has produced thought far otherwiſe; for who can think either <hi>Socrates</hi> or <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> loſt any repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, by their continual pains both in overcoming the defects and improving the gifts of nature? All are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the labour and aſſiduity with which <hi>Tully</hi> acquired his eloquence. <hi>Seneca,</hi> in his letters to <hi>Lucilius,</hi> aſſures him, there was not a day in which he did not either write ſomething, or read and epitomiſe ſome good author; and I remember <hi>Pliny,</hi> in one of his letters, where he gives an account of the various methods he uſed to fill up every vacancy of time, after ſeveral employments which he enumerates; ſometimes, ſays he, I hunt; but even then I carry with me a pocket book, that whilſt my ſervants are buſied in diſpoſing of the nets and other matters, I may be employed in ſomething that may be uſeful to me in my ſtudies; and that if I miſs of my game, I may at leaſt bring home ſome of my own thoughts with me, and not have the mortification of having caught nothing all day.</p>
               <p>Thus, Sir, you ſee how many examples I recal to mind, and what arguments I uſe with myſelf to regain my liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but as I am afraid it is no ordinary perſuaſion that
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:029518_0009_0FE1CBBFCCB835D8"/>

               <p>WE all of us complain of the ſhortneſs of time, ſaith <hi>Seneca,</hi> and yet have much more than we know what to do with. Our lives, ſays he, are ſpent either in doing nothing at all, or in doing nothing to the purpoſe, or in doing nothing that we ought to do. We are always complaining our days are few, and acting as though there would be no end of them. That noble philoſopher has deſcribed our inconſiſtency with ourſelves in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, by all thoſe various turns of expreſſion and thought which are peculiar to his writings.</p>
               <p>I often conſider mankind as wholly inconſiſtent with itſelf in a point that bears ſome affinity to the former. Though we ſeem grieved at the ſhortneſs of life in general, we are wiſhing every period of it at an end. The minor longs to be at age, then to be a man of buſineſs, then to make up an eſtate, then to arrive at honors, then to retire. Thus, although the whole of life is allowed by every one to be ſhort, the ſeveral diviſions of it appear to be long and tedious. We are for lengthening our ſpan in general, but would fain contract the parts of which it is compoſed. The uſurer would be very well ſatisfied to have all the time annihilated that lies between the preſent moment and next quarter day. The politician would be content to loſe three years in his life, could he place things in the poſture which he fancies they will ſtand in after ſuch a
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:029518_0010_0FE1CBCE0A71B0D8"/>
revolution of time. The lover would be glad to ſtrike out of his exiſtence all the moments that are to paſs away before the happy meeting. Thus, as faſt as our time runs, we ſhould be very glad, in moſt part of our lives, that it ran much faſter than it does. Several hours of the day hang upon our hands, nay, we wiſh away whole years, and travel through time as through a country filled with many wild and empty waſtes, which we would fain hurry over, that we may arrive at thoſe ſeveral little ſettlements, or imaginary points of reſt, which are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed up and down in it.</p>
               <p>If we divide the life of moſt men into twenty parts, we ſhall find that at leaſt nineteen of them are mere gaps and chaſms, which are neither filled with pleaſure nor buſineſs. I do not, however, include in this calculation the life of thoſe men who are in a perpetual hurry of affairs, but of thoſe only who are not always engaged in ſcenes of action; and I hope I ſhall not do an unacceptable piece of ſervice to thoſe perſons, if I point out to them certain methods for the filling up their empty ſpaces of life. The methods I ſhall propoſe to them are as follow:</p>
               <p>The firſt is the exerciſe of virtue, in the moſt general acceptation of the word. That particular ſcheme which comprehends the ſocial virtues, may give employment to the moſt induſtrious temper, and find a man more buſineſs than the moſt active ſtation of life. To adviſe the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, relieve the needy, comfort the afflicted, are duties that fall in our way almoſt every day of our lives. A man has frequent opportunities of mitigating the fierceneſs of a party; of doing juſtice to the character of a deſerving man; of ſoftening the envious, quieting the angry, and rectifying the prejudiced; which are all of them employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſuited to a reaſonable nature, and bring great ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to the perſon who can buſy himſelf in them with diſcretion.</p>
               <p>There is another kind of virtue that may find employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for thoſe retired hours in which we are altogether left to ourſelves, and deſtitute of company and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: I mean that intercourſe and communication which every reaſonable creature ought to maintain with the great Author of his being. The man who lives under an habitual ſenſe of the Divine preſence, keeps up a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual cheerfulneſs of temper, and enjoys every moment
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:029518_0010_0FE1CBCE0A71B0D8"/>
the ſatisfaction of thinking himſelf in company with his deareſt and beſt of friends. The time never lies heavy upon him: it is impoſſible for him to be alone. His thoughts and paſſions are the moſt buſied at ſuch hours, when thoſe of other men are the moſt inactive. He no ſooner ſteps out of the world, but his heart burns with devotion, ſwells with hope, and triumphs in the conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that preſence which every where ſurrounds him: or, on the contrary, pours out its fears, its ſorrows, its apprehenſions, to the great Supporter of its exiſtence.</p>
               <p>I have here only conſidered the neceſſity of a man's being virtuous, that he may have ſomething to do; but if I conſider further, that the exerciſe of virtue is not only an amuſement for the time it laſts, but that its influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence extends to thoſe parts of our exiſtence which lie beyond the grave; and that our whole eternity is to take its colour from thoſe hours which we here employ in virtue or in vice, the argument redoubles upon us, for putting in practice this method of paſſing away our time.</p>
               <p>When a man has but a little ſtock to improve, and has opportunities of turning it all to good account, what ſhall we think of him if he ſuffers nineteen parts of it to lie dead, and perhaps employs even the twentieth to his ruin or diſadvantage? But becauſe the mind cannot be always in its fervours, nor ſtrained up to a pitch of virtue, it is neceſſary to find out proper employments for it in its relaxations.</p>
               <p>The next method therefore that I would propoſe to fill up our time, ſhould be uſeful and innocent diverſion. I muſt confeſs I think it is below reaſonable creatures to be altogether converſant in ſuch diverſions as are merely innocent, and have nothing elſe to recommend them; but that there is no hurt in them. Whether any kind of gaming has even thus much to ſay for itſelf, I ſhall not determine; but I think it is very wonderful to ſee perſons of the beſt ſenſe paſſing away a dozen of hours together in ſhu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tling and dividing a pack of cards, with no other converſation but what is made up of a few game phraſes, and no other ideas but thoſe of black or red ſpots ranged together in different figures. Would not a man laugh to hear any one of this ſpecies complaining that life is ſhort!</p>
               <p>The ſtage might be made a perpetual ſource of the moſt noble and uſeful entertainments, were it under proper regulations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="unknown:029518_0011_0FE1CBD032D44C70"/>
But the mind never unbends itſelf ſo agreeably as in the converſation of a well-choſen friend. There is indeed no bleſſing in life that is any way comparable to the enjoyment of a diſcreet and virtuous friend. It eaſes and unloads the mind, clears and improves the underſtanding, engenders thought and knowledge, animates virtue and good reſolutions, ſooths and allays the paſſions, and finds employment for moſt of the vacant hours of life.</p>
               <p>Next to ſuch an intimacy with a particular perſon, one would endeavour after a more general converſation with ſuch as are capable of edifying and entertaining thoſe with whom they converſe, which are qualities that ſeldom go aſunder.</p>
               <p>There are many other uſeful amuſements of life which one would endeavour to multiply, that one might, on all occaſions, have recourſe to ſomething, rather than ſuffer the mind to lie idle, or run adrift with any paſſion that chances to ariſe in it.</p>
               <p>A man that has a taſte for muſic, painting, or architec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is like one that has another ſenſe, when compared with ſuch as have no reliſh of thoſe arts. The floriſt, the planter, the gardener, the huſbandman, when they are only as accompliſhments to the man of fortune, are great reliefs to a country life, and many ways uſeful to thoſe who are poſſeſſed of them.</p>

               <p>After having for ſome time been taken up with this courſe of thought, I diverted myſelf with a book, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my uſual cuſtom, in order to unbend my mind before I went to ſleep. The book, I made uſe of on this occaſion was <hi>Lucian.</hi> where I amuſed my thoughts for about an hour among the dialogues of the dead, which, in all probability, produced the following dream:</p>
               <p>I was conveyed, methought, into the entrance of the infernal regions, where I ſaw <hi>Rhadamanthus,</hi> one of the judges of the dead, ſeated in his tribunal. On his left hand ſtood the keeper of <hi>Erebus,</hi> on his right hand the keeper of <hi>Elyſium.</hi> I was told he ſat judge on women that day, there being ſeveral of the ſex lately arrived, who had not yet their manſions aſſigned them. I was ſurpriſed to hear him aſk every one of them the ſame queſtion, <hi>What they had been doing?</hi> Upon this queſtion being propoſed to the whole aſſembly, they ſtared upon one another, as not knowing what to anſwer. He then interrogated each of them ſeparately. Madam, ſays he to the firſt of them, you have been upon the earth about fifty years: what have you been doing there all this while? Doing! ſays ſhe, really I do not know what I have been doing: I deſire I may have time given me to recollect. After about half an hour's pauſe, ſhe told him ſhe had been playing at crimp; upon which <hi>Rhadamanthus</hi> beckoned to the keeper on his left hand to take her into cuſtody. And you, Madam, ſays the judge, who look with ſuch a ſoft and languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing air, I think you ſet our for this place in your nine and twentieth year, what have you been doing all this while? I had a great deal of buſineſs on my hands, ſays ſhe, being taken up the firſt twelve years of my life in dreſſing a jointed baby, and the remaining part of it in reading plays and romances. Very well, ſays he, you have employed your time to good purpoſe: away with her. The next was a plain country woman: well, miſtreſs, ſays <hi>Rhadamanthus,</hi> and what have you been doing? If it pleaſe your Worſhip, ſays ſhe, I did not live quite forty years; and in that time brought my huſband ſeven daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, made him nine thouſand cheeſes, and left my eldeſt
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:029518_0012_0FE1CBD1D67BE3D0"/>
girl with him, to look after his houſe in my abſence, and who I may venture to ſay is as pretty a houſe-wife as any in the country. <hi>Rhadamanthus</hi> ſmiled at the ſimplicity of the good woman, and ordered the keeper of <hi>Elyſium</hi> to take her into <hi>his</hi> care. And you, fair lady, ſays he, what have you been doing theſe five and thirty years? I have been doing no hurt, I aſſure you, Sir, ſaid ſhe. That is well, ſays he; but what good have you been doing? The lady was in great confuſion at this queſtion, and not knowing what to anſwer, the two keepers leaped out to ſeize her at the ſame time; the one took her by the hand to convey her to <hi>Elyſium,</hi> the other caught hold of her to carry her away to <hi>Erebus.</hi> But <hi>Rhadamanthus</hi> obſerving an ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous modeſty in her countenance and behaviour, bid them both let her looſe, and ſet her aſide for re-examination when he was more at leiſure. An old woman, of a proud and ſour look, preſented herſelf next to the bar, and being aſked what ſhe had been doing? Truly, ſays ſhe, I lived threeſcore and ten years in a very wicked world, and was ſo angry at the behaviour of a parcel of young flirts, that I paſt moſt of my laſt years in condemning the follies of the times: I was every day blaming the ſilly conduct of the people about me, in order to deter thoſe I converſed with from falling into the like errors and miſcarriages Very well, ſays <hi>Rhadamanthus,</hi> but did you keep the ſame watchful eye over your own actions? Why, truly, ſays ſhe, I was ſo taken up with publiſhing the faults of others, that I had not time to conſider my own. Madam, ſays <hi>Rhadamanthus,</hi> be pleaſed to file off to the left, and make room for the venerable matron that ſtands behinds you. Old gentlewoman, ſays he, I think you are fourſcore: you have heard the queſtion, what have you been doing ſo long in the world? Ah, Sir! ſays ſhe, I have been doing what I ſhould not have done; but I had made a firm reſolution to have changed my life, if I had not been ſnatched off by an untimely end. Madam, ſays he, you will pleaſe to follow your leader; and ſpying another of the ſame age, interrogated her in the ſame form. To whom the matron replied, I have been the wife of a huſband, who was as dear to me in his old age as in his youth. I have been a mother, and very happy in my children, whom I endeavoured to bring up in every thing that was good. My eldeſt ſon is bleſſed by the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:029518_0012_0FE1CBD1D67BE3D0"/>
poor, and beloved by every one that knows him. I lived within my own family, and left it much more wealthy than I found it. <hi>Rhadamanthus</hi> who knew the value of the old lady, ſmiled upon her in ſuch a manner, that the keeper of <hi>Elyſium,</hi> who knew his office, reached out his hand to her. He no ſooner touched her, but her wrinkles van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed, her eyes ſparkled, her cheeks glowed with bluſhes, and ſhe appeared in full beauty. A young woman obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that this officer who conducted the happy to <hi>Elyſium,</hi> was ſo great a <hi>beautifier,</hi> longed to be in his hands; ſo that preſſing through the crowd, ſhe was the next who appeared at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I have endeavoured ſays ſhe, ever ſince I came to years of diſcretion, to make myſelf lovely, and gain admirers. In order to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

               <p>I was then ſurpriſed with a diſtant ſound of a whole troop of females that came forward laughing, ſinging, and dancing. I was very deſirous to know the reception they would meet with, and withal was very apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive that <hi>Rhadamanthus</hi> would ſpoil their mirth: but at their nearer approach, the noiſe grew ſo very great that it awakened me.</p>
               <p>I lay ſome time, reflecting in myſelf on the oddneſs of this dream, and could not forbear aſking my own heart what I was doing? I anſwered myſelf, That I was wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>guardians.</hi> If my readers make as good a uſe of this work as I deſign they ſhould, I hope it will never be imputed to me as a work that is vain and unprofitable.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude with recommending to them the ſame ſhort ſelf-examination. If every one of them fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently lays his hand upon his heart, and conſiders what he is doing, it will check him in all the idle, or, what is worſe, the vicious moments of life; lift up his mind when it is running on in a ſeries of indifferent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and encourage him when he is engaged in thoſe
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:029518_0013_0FE1CBD376E97AD8"/>
that are virtuous and laudable. In a word, it will very much alleviate that guilt which the beſt of men have reaſon to acknowledge in their daily confeſſions, of <hi>leaving undone thoſe things which they ought to have done, and of doing thoſe things which they ought not to have done.</hi>

They know ſo well the vanity of thoſe imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inary perfections that ſwell the heart of man, and of thoſe little ſupernumerary advantages, whether in birth, fortune, or title, which one man enjoys above another, that it muſt certainly very much aſtoniſh, if it does not very much divert them, when they ſee a mortal puffed up, and valuing himſelf above his neighbours on any of theſe accounts, at the ſame time that he is obnoxious to all the common calamities of the ſpecies.</p>
               <p>To ſet this thought in its true light, we ſhall fancy, if you pleaſe, that yonder mole-hill is inhabited by reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able creatures, and that every piſmire (his ſhape and way of life only excepted) is endowed with human paſſions. How ſhould we ſmile to hear one give an account of the pedigrees, diſtinctions, and titles that reign amongſt them! Obſerve how the whole ſwarm divide, and make way for the piſmire that paſſes through them! You muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand he is an emmet of quality, and has better blood in his veins than any piſmire in the mole-hill. Do you not ſee how ſenſible he is of it, how ſlow he marches forward, how the whole rabble of ants keep their diſtance? Here you may obſerve one placed upon a little eminence, and looking down on a long row of laborers. He is the richeſt inſect on this ſide the hillock: he has a walk of half a yard in length, and a quarter of an inch in breadth; he keeps one hundred menial ſervants, and has at leaſt fifteen bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley corns in his granary. He is now chiding and enſlav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the emmet that ſtands before him, and who, for all we can diſcover, is as good an emmet as himſelf.</p>
               <p>But here comes an inſect of figure: do not you take
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:029518_0013_0FE1CBD376E97AD8"/>
notice of a little white ſtraw that he carries in his mouth? That ſtraw, you muſt underſtand, he would not part with for the longeſt tract about the mole-hill: did you but know what he has undergone to purchaſe it! See how the ants of all qualities and conditions ſwarm about him. Should this ſtraw drop out of his mouth, you would ſee all this numerous circle of attendants follow the next that took it up, and leave the diſcarded inſect, or run over his back to come at his ſucceſſor.</p>
               <p>If now you have a mind to ſee all the ladies of the mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, obſerve firſt the piſmire that liſtens to the emmet on her left hand, at the ſame time ſhe ſeems to turn away her head from him. He tells this poor infect that ſhe is a goddeſs; that her eyes are brighter than the ſun; that life and death are at her diſpoſal. She believes him, and gives herſelf a thouſand little airs upon it. Mark the vanity of the piſmire on her left hand. She can ſcarce crawl with age; but you muſt know ſhe values herſelf upon her birth; and, if you mind, ſpurns at every one that comes within her reach. The little nimble coquette that is running along the ſide of her is a wit. She has broken many a piſmire's heart. Do but obſerve what a drove of lovers are running after her.</p>
               <p>We will here finiſh this imaginary ſcene; but firſt of all, to draw the parallel cloſer, will ſuppoſe, if you pleaſe, that death comes down upon the mole-hill in the ſhape of a cock-ſparrow, and picks up, without diſtinction, the piſmire of quality, and his flatterers, the piſmire of ſubſtance and his day-labourers, the white-ſtraw officer and his ſycophants, with all the goddeſſes, wits, and beauties of the mole-hill.</p>
               <p>May we not imagine that beings of ſuperior natures and perfections regard all the inſtances of pride and vanity among our own ſpecies in the ſame kind of view, when they take a ſurvey of thoſe who inhabit this earth; or, in the language of an ingenious <hi>French</hi> poet, of thoſe piſmires that people this heap of dirt, which human vanity has divided into climates and regions.</p>

               <p>IN the midſt of that vaſt ocean, commonly called the <hi>South Sea,</hi> lie the iſlands of <hi>Solomon.</hi> In the centre of thoſe lies one, not only diſtant from the reſt, which are immenſely ſcattered round it, but alſo larger beyond proportion. An anceſtor of the Prince, who now reigns abſolute in this central iſland, has, through a long deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of ages, entailed the name of <hi>Solomon's Iſlands</hi> on the whole, by the effect of that wiſdom wherewith he had poliſhed the manners of his people.</p>
               <p>A deſcendant of one of the great men of this happy iſland, becoming a gentleman to ſo improved a degree as to deſpiſe the good qualities which had originally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobled his family, thought of nothing but how to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and diſtinguiſh his dignity by the pride of an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant mind, and a diſpoſition abandoned to pleaſure. He had a houſe on the ſea ſide, where he ſpent great part of his time in hunting and fiſhing but found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at a loſs in purſuit of thoſe important diverſions, by means of a long ſlip of marſh land, over grown with high reeds that lay between his houſe and the ſea. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving, at length, that it became not a man of his qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity to ſubmit to reſtraint in his pleaſures, for the eaſe and convenience of an obſtinate mechanic; and having often endeavoured in vain to buy out the owner, who was an honeſt poor baſket-maker, and whoſe livelihood depended on working up the flags of thoſe reeds, in a manner peculiar to himſelf, the gentleman took advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of a very high wind, and commanded his ſervants to burn down the barrier.</p>
               <p>The baſket-maker, who ſaw himſelf undone, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of the oppreſſion in terms more ſuited to his ſenſe of the injury, than the reſpect due to the rank of the offender: and the reward this imprudence procured him, was the additional injuſtice of blows and reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and all kinds of inſult and indignity.</p>
               <p>There was but one way to a remedy, and he took it; for going to the capital with the marks of his hard uſage upon him, he threw himſelf at the ſect of the King, and
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:029518_0014_0FE1CBE05A555158"/>
procured a citation for his oppreſſor's appearance; who, confeſſing the charge, proceeded to juſtify his behaviour by the poor man's unmindfulneſs of the ſubmiſſion due from the vulgar to gentlemen of rank and diſtinction.</p>
               <p>But pray, replied the King, what diſtinction of rank had the grandfather of your father; when, being a cleaver of wood in the palace of my anceſtors, he was raiſed from among thoſe vulgar you ſpeak of with ſuch contempt, in reward of an inſtance he gave of his courage and loyalty in defence of his maſter? Yet his diſtinction was nobler than yours: it was the diſtinction of ſoul, not of birth; the ſuperiority of worth, not of fortune! I am ſorry I have a gentleman in my kingdom, who is baſe enough to be ignorant, that caſe and diſtinction of fortune were beſtowed on him but to this end, that, being at reſt from all cares of providing for himſelf, he might apply his heart, head, and hand for the public advantage of others.</p>
               <p>Here the king, diſcontinuing his ſpeech, fixed an eye of indignation on a ſullen reſentment of mein which he obſerved in the haughty offender, who muttered out his diſlike of the encouragement this way of thinking muſt give to the commonalty, who, he ſaid, were to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as perſons of no conſequence, in compariſon of men who were born to be honored. Where reflection is wanting, replied the King, with a ſmile of diſdain, men muſt find their defects in the pain of their ſufferings. <hi>Yarbuma,</hi> added he, turning to a captain of his galleys, ſtrip the injured and the injurer; and conveying them to one of the moſt barbarous and remoteſt of the iſlands, ſet them aſhore in the night, and leave them both to their fortune.</p>
               <p>The place in which they were landed was a marſh: under cover of thoſe flags the gentleman was in hopes to conceal himſelf, and give the ſlip to his companion, with whom he thought it a diſgrace to be found: but the lights in the galley having given an alarm to the ſavages, a conſiderable body of them came down, and diſcovered in the morning, the two ſtrangers in their hiding-place. Setting up a diſmal yell, they ſurrounded them; and advancing nearer and nearer with a kind of clubs, ſeemed determined to diſpatch them, without ſenſe of hoſpitality or mercy.</p>
               <p>Here the gentleman began to diſcover, that the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:029518_0015_0FE1CBE283314A90"/>
of his blood was imaginary: for, between the conſciouſneſs of ſhame and cold, under the nakedneſs he had never been uſed to; a fear of the event from the fierceneſs of the ſavages' approach; and the want of an idea whereby to ſoften or divert their aſperity, he fell behind the poor ſharer of his calamity; and with an unſinewed, apprehenſive, unmanly ſneakingneſs of mein, gave up the poſt of honour, and made a leader of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> man whom he had thought it a diſgrace to conſider as a companion.</p>
               <p>The baſket-maker, on the contrary, to whom the pov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty of his condition had made nakedneſs habitual; to whom a life of pain and mortification repreſented death as not dreadful; and whoſe remembrance of his ſkill in arts, of which theſe ſavages, were ignorant, gave him hopes of becoming ſafe, from demonſtrating that he could be uſeful, moved with bolder and more open free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and, having plucked a handful of the flags, ſat down without emotion, and making ſigns that he would ſhew them ſomething worthy of their attention, fell to work with ſmiles and noddings; while the ſavages drew near, and gazed with expectation of the conſequence.</p>
               <p>It was not long before he had wreathed a kind of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onet, of pretty workmanſhip; and riſing with reſpect and fearfulneſs, approached the ſavage who appeared the chief, and placed it gently on his head; whoſe figure under this new ornament, ſo charmed and ſtruck his followers, that they threw down all their clubs, and formed a dance of welcome and congratulation round the author of ſo prized a favour.</p>
               <p>There was not one but ſhewed the marks of his impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to be made as fine as his captain: ſo the poor baſket-maker had his hands full of employment; and the ſavages obſerving one quite idle, while the other was ſo buſy in their ſervice, took up arms in behalf of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral juſtice, and began to lay on arguments in favour of their purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The baſket-maker's pity now effaced the remembrance of his ſufferings: ſo he aroſe and reſcued his oppreſſor, by making ſigns that he was ignorant of the art; but might, if they thought fit, be uſefully employed in wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the work, and fetching flags to his ſupply as faſt as he ſhould want them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="unknown:029518_0015_0FE1CBE283314A90"/>
This propoſition luckily fell in with a deſire the ſava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges expreſſed to keep themſelves at leiſure, that they might crowd round, and mark the progreſs of a work they took ſuch pleaſure in. They left the gentleman, therefore, to his duty in the baſket-maker's ſervice; and conſidered him, from that time forward, as one who was, and ought to be treated as inferiour to their benefactor.</p>
               <p>Men, wives, and children, from all corners of the iſland, came in droves for coronets; and, ſetting the gentleman to work to gather boughs and poles, made a fine hut to lodge the baſket-maker; and brought down daily from the country ſuch proviſions as they lived upon themſelves, taking care to offer the imagined ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant nothing till his maſter had done eating.</p>
               <p>Three months reflection in this mortified condition, gave a new and juſt turn to our gentleman's improved ideas; inſomuch, that, lying weeping, and awake, one night, he thus confeſſed his ſentiments in favour of the baſket-maker: I have been to blame, and wanted judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to diſtinguiſh between accident and excellence. When I ſhould have meaſured nature, I but looked to vanity. The preference which fortune gives is empty and imaginary; and I perceive, too late, that only things of uſe are naturally honourable. I am aſhamed, when I compare my malice, to remember your humanity: but if the gods ſhould pleaſe to call me to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>He promiſed, and performed his promiſe: for the King, ſoon after, ſent the Captain who had landed them, with preſents to the ſavages; and ordered him to bring both back again. And it continues to this day a cuſtom in that iſland, to degrade all gentlemen who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give a better reaſon for their pride, than that they were born to do nothing; and the word for this due puniſhment is, <hi>Send him to the baſket-maker.</hi>

There is ſomething unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral in painting, which a ſkilful eye will eaſily diſcern from native beauty and complexion.</p>
               <p>It is hard to perſonate, and act a part long; for where truth is not at the bottom, nature will always be endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to return, and will peep out and betray herſelf one time or another. Therefore, if any man think it convenient to ſeem good, let him be ſo indeed, and then his goodneſs will appear to every body's ſatisfaction; ſo that upon all accounts ſincerity is true wiſdom. Partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ularly as to the affairs of this world, integrity hath many advantages over all the fine and artificial ways of diſſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulation and deceit; it is much the plainer and eaſier, much the ſafer and more ſecure way of dealing in the world; it has leſs of trouble and difficulty, of entangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and perplexity, of danger and hazard in it; it is the ſhorteſt and neareſt way to our end, carrying us thither in a ſtrait line, and will hold out and laſt longeſt. The arts of deceit and cunning do continually grow weaker and leſs effectual and ſerviceable to thoſe that uſe them; whereas integrity gains ſtrength by uſe, and the more and longer any man practiſeth it, the greater ſervice it does him, by confirming his reputation, and encouraging thoſe with whom he hath to do, to repoſe the greateſt truſt and confidence in him, which is an unſpeakable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in the buſineſs and affairs of life.</p>
               <p>Truth is always conſiſtent with itſelf, and needs noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to help it out; it is always near at hand, and ſits up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our lips, and is ready to drop out before we are aware; whereas a lie is troubleſome, and ſets a man's invention upon the rack, and one trick needs a great many more to make it good. It is like building upon a falſe founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:029518_0016_0FE1CBE423E7ECD0"/>
which continually ſtands in need of props to ſhore it up, and proves at laſt to be more chargeable than to have raiſed a ſubſtantial building at firſt upon a true and ſolid foundation; for ſincerity is firm and ſubſtantial, and there is nothing hollow and unſound in it, and becauſe it is plain and open, fears no diſcovery; of which the crafty man is always in danger, and when he thinks he walks in the dark, all his pretences are ſo tranſparent, that he that runs may read them: he is the laſt man that finds himſelf to be found out: and while he takes it for granted that he makes fools of others, he renders him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ridiculous.</p>
               <p>Add to all this, that ſincerity is the moſt compendious wiſdom, and an excellent inſtrument for the ſpeedy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch of buſineſs; it creates confidence in thoſe we have to deal with, ſaves the labour of many inquiries, and brings things to an iſſue in a few words: it is like travelling in a plain beaten road, that commonly brings men ſooner to their journey's end, than by ways in which they often loſe themſelves. In a word, whatſoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience may be thought to be in falſehood and diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, it is ſoon over; but the inconvenience of it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual, becauſe it brings a man under an everlaſting jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy and ſuſpicion; ſo that he is not believed when he ſpeaks the truth, nor truſted when perhaps he means honeſtly. When a man hath once forfeited the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his integrity, he is ſet faſt, and nothing will then ſerve his turn, neither truth nor falſehood.</p>
               <p>I have often thought, that God hath, in his great wiſdom, hid from men of falſe and diſhoneſt minds, the wonderful advantages of truth and integrity, to the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity even of their worldly affairs; thoſe men are ſo blinded by their covetouſneſs and ambition, that they cannot look beyond a preſent advantage, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Were but this ſort of men wiſe and clear-ſighted enough to diſcern this, they would be honeſt out of very knavery, not out of any love to honeſty and virtue, but with a crafty deſign to promote and advance more effectually their own intereſts; and therefore the juſtice of the divine Providence hath hid
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:029518_0017_0FE1CBE5C4516860"/>
this trueſt point of wiſdom from their eyes, that bad men might not be upon equal terms with the juſt and upright, and ſerve their own wicked deſigns by honeſt and lawful means.</p>
               <p>Indeed, if a man were only to deal in the world for a day, and ſhould never have occaſion to converſe more with mankind, never more need their good opinion or good word, it were then no great matter (ſpeaking as to the concernments of this world) if a man ſpent his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation all at once, and ventured it at one throw: but if he be to continue in the world, and would have the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of converſation whilſt he is in it, let him make uſe of truth and ſincerity in all his words and actions; for nothing but this will laſt and hold out to the end: all other arts will fail; but truth and integrity will carry a man through, and bear him out to the laſt.</p>

The two circumſtances of being always at home from her lameneſs, and very attentive from her blindneſs, make her lodgings the receptacle of all that paſſes in town, good or bad; but for the latter, ſhe ſeems to have the better memory. There is another thing to be noted of her, which is, that as it is uſual with old people, ſhe has a livelier memory of things which paſſed when ſhe was very young, than of late years. Add to all this, that ſhe not only does not love any body, but ſhe hates every body. The ſtatue in <hi>Rome</hi> does not ſerve to vent malice half ſo well, as this old lady does to diſappoint it. She does not know the author of any thing that is told her; but can readily repeat the matter itſelf; therefore, though ſhe expoſes the whole town, ſhe offends no body in it. She is ſo exquiſitely reſtleſs and peeviſh, that ſhe quarrels with all about her, and ſometimes, in a freak, will inſtantly change her habitation. To indulge this humour, ſhe is led about the grounds belonging to the ſame houſe ſhe is in, and the perſons to whom ſhe is to remove, being in the plot, are ready to receive her at her own chamber again. At ſtated times the gentle woman at whoſe houſe ſhe ſuppoſes ſhe is at the time, is ſent for to quarrel with, according to her common cuſtom. When they have a mind to drive the jeſt, ſhe is immediately urged to that degree, that ſhe will board in a family with which ſhe has never yet been; and away ſhe will go this inſtant, and tell them all that the reſt have been ſaying of them. By this means ſhe has been an inhabitant of every houſe in the place; without ſtirring from the ſame habitation; and the many ſtories which every body furniſh her with to favour that deceit, make her the general intelligencer of the
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:029518_0018_0FE1CBF53AB76EE0"/>
town of all that can be ſaid by one woman againſt another. Thus, groundleſs ſtories die away, and ſometimes truths are ſmothered under the general word; when they have a mind to diſcountenance a thing, "Oh! that is in my Lady <hi>Bluemantle's</hi> memoirs."</p>
               <p>Whoever receives impreſſions to the diſadvantage of others without examination, is to be had in no other credit for intelligence than this good Lady <hi>Bluemantle,</hi> who is ſubjected to have her ears impoſed upon for want of other helps to better information. Add to this, that other ſcandal-bearers ſuſpend the uſe of thoſe faculties which ſhe has loſt, rather than apply them to do juſtice to their neighbours; and I think, for the ſervice of my fair readers, to acquaint them, that there is a voluntary Lady <hi>Bluemantle</hi> at every viſit in town.</p>

               <p>WERE all the vexations of life put together, we ſhould find, that a great part of them proceed from thoſe calumnies and reproaches which we ſpread abroad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning one another.</p>
               <p>There is ſcarce a man living who is not, in ſome degree, guilty of this offence; though, at the ſame time, however we treat one another, it muſt be confeſſed, that we all conſent in ſpeaking ill of the perſons who are notorious in this practice. It generally takes its riſe either from an ill will to mankind, a private inclination to make ourſelves eſteemed, an oſtentation of wit, a vanity of being thought in the ſecrets of the world, or from a deſire of gratifying any of theſe diſpoſitions of mind in thoſe perſons with whom we converſe.</p>
               <p>The publiſher of ſcandal is more or leſs odious to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and criminal in himſelf, as he is influenced by any one or more of the foregoing motives. But whatever may be the occaſion of ſpreading theſe falſe reports, he ought to conſider, that the effect of them is equally preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:029518_0019_0FE1CBF6DE0DD130"/>
and pernicious to the perſon at whom they are aimed. The injury is the ſame, though the principle from whence it proceeds may be different.</p>
               <p>As every one looks upon himſelf with too much indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence when he paſſes a judgment on his own thoughts of actions; and as very few would be thought guilty of this abominable proceeding, which is ſo univerſally practiſed, and, at the ſame time, ſo univerſally blamed, I ſhall lay down three rules, by which I would have a man examine and ſearch into his own heart, before he ſtands acquitted to himſelf of that evil diſpoſition of mind which I am here mentioning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Let him conſider whether he does not take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in hearing the faults of others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether he is not too apt to believe ſuch lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle blackening accounts, and more inclined to be cred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulous on the uncharitable than on the good natured ſide.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whether he is not ready to ſpread and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate ſuch reports as tend to the diſreputation of another.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the ſeveral ſteps by which this vice proceeds, and grows up into ſlander and defamation.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, a man who takes delight in hearing the faults of others, ſhews ſufficiently that he has a true reliſh of ſcandal, and conſequently the ſeeds of this vice within him. If his mind is gratified with hearing the reproaches which are caſt on others, he will find the ſame pleaſure in relating them, and be the more apt to do it, as he will naturally imagine every one he conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes with is delighted in the ſame manner with himſelf. A man ſhould endeavour therefore to wear out of his mind this criminal curioſity, which is perpetually heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened and inflamed by liſtening to ſuch ſtories as tend to the diſreputation of others.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, a man ſhould conſult his own heart, whether he is not apt to <hi>believe</hi> ſuch little black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening accounts; and more inclined to be credulous on the uncharitable, than on the good-natured ſide.</p>
               <p>Such a credulity is very vicious in itſelf, and generally ariſes from a man's conſciouſneſs of his own ſecret cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions. It is a pretty ſaying of <hi>Thales,</hi> Falſehood is juſt as far diſtant from truth, as the ears are from the eyes. By which he would intimate, that a wiſe man
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:029518_0019_0FE1CBF6DE0DD130"/>
ſhould not eaſily give credit to the reports of actions which he has not ſeen. I ſhall, under this head, mention two or three remarkable rules to be obſerved by the members of the celebrated Abbe <hi>de la Trappe,</hi> as they are publiſhed in a little <hi>French</hi> book.</p>
               <p>The fathers are there ordered, never to give an ear to any accounts of baſe or criminal actions; to turn off all ſuch diſcourſe if poſſible; but in caſe they hear any thing of this nature ſo well atteſted that they cannot diſbelieve it, they are then to ſuppoſe that the criminal actions may have proceeded from a good intention in him who is guilty of it. This is perhaps carrying chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to an extravagance; but it is certainly much more lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, than to ſuppoſe, as the ill-natured part of the world does, that indifferent and even good actions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from bad principles and wrong intentions.</p>
               <p>In the third place, a man ſhould examine his heart, whether he does not find in it a ſecret inclination to propagate ſuch reports as tend to the diſrepuation of another.</p>
               <p>When the diſeaſe of the mind, which I have hitherto been ſpeaking of, ariſes to this degree of malignity, it diſcovers itſelf in its worſt ſymptoms, and is in danger of becoming incurable. I need not therefore inſiſt upon the guilt in this laſt particular, which every one cannot but diſapprove, who is not void of humanity, or even common diſcretion; I ſhall only add, whatever pleaſure any man may take in ſpreading whiſpers of this nature, he will find an infinitely greater ſatisfaction in conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the temptation he is under, by letting the ſecret die within his own breaſt.</p>

               <p>I HAVE always preferred cheerfulneſs to mirth. The latter I conſider as an act, the former as an habit of the mind. Mirth is ſhort and tranſient; cheerfulneſs fixed and permanent. Thoſe are often raiſed into the greateſt tranſports of mirth, who are ſubject to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt depreſſions of melancholy. On the contrary, cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:029518_0020_0FE1CBF882DACDF0"/>
though it does not give the mind ſuch an exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite gladneſs, prevents us from falling into any depths of ſorrow. Mirth is like a flaſh of lightning, that breaks through a gloom of clouds, and glitters for a moment; cheerfulneſs keeps up a kind of day-light in the mind, and fills it with a ſteady and perpetual ſerenity.</p>
               <p>Men of auſtere principles look upon mirth as too wanton and diſſolute for a ſtate of probation, and as filled with a certain triumph and inſolence of heart that is inconſiſtent with a life which is every moment obnoxious to the greateſt dangers. Writers of this complexion have obſerved, that the ſacred Perſon, who was the great pattern of perfection, was never ſeen to laugh.</p>
               <p>Cheerfulneſs of mind is not liable to any of theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions: it is of a ſerious and compoſed nature, it does not throw the mind into a condition improper for the preſent ſtate of humanity, and is very conſpicuous in the character of thoſe who are looked upon as the greateſt philoſophers among the heathens, as well as among thoſe who have been deſervedly eſteemed as ſaints and holy men among Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>If we conſider cheerfulneſs in three lights, with regard to ourſelves, to thoſe we converſe with, and to the great Author of our being, it will not a little recommend itſelf on each of thoſe accounts. The man who is poſſeſſed of this excellent frame of mind, is not only eaſy in his thoughts, but a perfect maſter of all the powers and fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulties of his ſoul: his imagination is always clear, and his judgment undiſturbed: his temper is even and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruffled, whether in action or ſolitude: He comes with a reliſh of all thoſe goods which nature has provided for him, taſtes all the pleaſures of the creation which are poured about him, and does not feel the full weight of thoſe accidental evils which may befal him.</p>
               <p>If we conſider him in relation to the perſons whom he converſes with, it naturally produces love and good-will towards him. A cheerful mind is not only diſpoſed to be affable and obliging, but raiſes the ſame good humour in thoſe who come within its influence. A man finds himſelf pleaſed, he does not know why, with the cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of his companions: it is like a ſudden ſun-ſhine that awakens a ſecret delight in the mind without attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it. The heart rejoices of its own accord, and
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:029518_0020_0FE1CBF882DACDF0"/>
naturally flows out into friendſhip and benevolence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the perſon who has ſo kindly an effect upon it.</p>
               <p>When I conſider this cheerful ſtate of mind in its third relation, I cannot but look upon it as a conſtant habitual gratitude to the great Author of nature. An inward cheerfulneſs is an implicit praiſe and thankſgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Providence under its diſpenſations. It is a kind of acquieſcence in the ſtate wherein we are placed, and a ſecret approbation of the divine will in his conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards man.</p>
               <p>There are but two things, which, in my opinion, can reaſonably deprive us of this cheerfulneſs of heart. The firſt of theſe is the ſenſe of guilt. A man who lives in a ſtate of vice and impenitence, can have no title to that evenneſs and tranquillity of mind, which is the health of the ſoul, and the natural effect of virtue and innocence. Cheerfulneſs in an ill man deſerves a harder name than language can furniſh us with, and as many degrees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what we commonly call folly and madneſs.</p>
               <p>Atheiſm, by which I mean a diſbelief of the ſupreme Being, and conſequently of a future ſtate, under what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever title it ſhelters itſelf, may likewiſe very reaſonably deprive a man of his cheerfulneſs of temper. There is ſomething ſo particularly gloomy and offenſive to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature in the proſpect of non-exiſtence, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but wonder, with many excellent writers, how it is poſſible for a man to out-live the expectation of it. For my own part, I think the being of a God is ſo little to be doubted, that it is almoſt the only truth we are ſure of, and ſuch a truth as we meet with in every object, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry occurrence, and in every thought. If we look into the character of this tribe of infidels, we generally find, they are made up of pride, ſpleen, and cavil. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed no wonder, that men, who are uneaſy to themſelves, ſhould be ſo to the reſt of the world; and how is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for a man to be otherwiſe than uneaſy in himſelf, when he is in danger every moment of loſing his entire exiſtence, and dropping into nothing!</p>
               <p>The vicious man and Atheiſt have therefore no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to cheerfulneſs, and would act very unreaſonably, ſhould they endeavour at it. It is impoſſible for any one to live in good humour, and enjoy his preſent exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, who is apprehenſive either of torment, or annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; of being miſerable, or of not being at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="unknown:029518_0021_0FE1CBFA1FFF3150"/>
After having mentioned theſe two great principles which are deſtructive of cheerfulneſs in their own nature, as well as in right reaſon, I cannot think of any other that ought to baniſh this happy temper from a virtuous mind. Pain and ſickneſs, ſhame and reproach, poverty and old age, nay death itſelf, conſidering the ſhortneſs of their duration, and the advantage we may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> from them, do not deſerve the name of evils. A good mind may bear up under them with fortitude, with patience, and with cheerfulneſs of heart. The toſſing of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, does not diſcompoſe him, who is ſure it will bring him to a joyful harbour.</p>
               <p>A man who uſes his beſt endeavours to live according to the dictates of virtue and right reaſon, has two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual ſources of cheerfulneſs; in the conſideration of his own nature, and of that Being on whom he has a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence. If he look into himſelf, he cannot but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in that exiſtence, which is ſo lately beſtowed upon him, and which, after millions of ages, will be ſtill new, and ſtill in its beginning. How many ſelf-congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions naturally ariſe in the mind when it reflects on this its entrance into eternity, when it takes a view of thoſe improveable faculties, which in a few years, and even at his firſt ſetting out, have made ſo conſiderable a prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs and which will be ſtill receiving an increaſe of perfection, and conſequently an increaſe of happineſs! The conſciouſneſs of ſuch a Being ſpreads a perpetual diffuſion of joy through the ſoul of a virtuous man, and makes him look upon himſelf every moment as more happy than he knows how to conceive.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſource of cheerfulneſs to a good mind, is its conſideration of that Being on whom we have our dependence, and in whom, though we behold him, as yet but in the firſt faint diſcoveries of his perfections, we ſee every thing that we can imagine as great, glorious, or amiable. We find ourſelves every where upheld by his goodneſs, and ſurrounded with an immenſity of love and mercy. In ſhort, we depend upon a Being, whoſe power qualifies him to make us happy by an infinity of means, whoſe goodneſs and truth engage him to make tho <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> happy who deſire it of him, and whoſe unchangeableneſs will ſecure us in this happineſs to all eternity.</p>
               <p>Such conſiderations, which every one ſhould perpetually
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:029518_0021_0FE1CBFA1FFF3150"/>
cheriſh in his thoughts, will baniſh from us all that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret heavineſs of heart, which unthinking men are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to when they lie under no real affliction; all that anguiſh which we may feel from any evil that actually oppreſſes us, to which I may likewiſe add, thoſe little cracklings of mirth and folly that are apter to betray virtue than ſupport it; and eſtabliſh in us ſuch an even and cheerful temper, as will make us pleaſing to ourſelves, to thoſe with whom we converſe, and to him whom we were made to pleaſe.</p>

               <p>CHEERFULNESS is, in the firſt place, the beſt promoter of health. Repinings, and ſecret murmurs of heart, give imperceptible ſtrokes to thoſe delicate fibres of which the vital parts are compoſed, and wear out the machine inſenſibly; not to mention thoſe violent ferments which they ſtir up in the blood, and thoſe irregular, diſturbed motions which they raiſe in the animal ſpirits. I ſcarce remember; in my own obſervations, to have met with many old men, or with ſuch who, (to uſe our <hi>Engliſh</hi> phraſe) <hi>wear <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>well,</hi> that had not at leaſt a certain indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in their humour, if not a more than ordinary gaiety and cheerfulneſs of heart. The truth of it is, health and cheerfulneſs mutually beget each other; with this difference, that we ſeldom meet with a great degree of health which is not attended with a certain cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but very often ſee cheerfulneſs where there is no great degree of health.</p>
               <p>Cheerfulneſs bears the ſame friendly regard to the mind as to the body: it baniſhes all anxious care and diſcontent, ſoothes and compoſes the paſſions, and keeps the ſoul in a perpetual calm. But having already touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on this laſt conſideration, I ſhall here take notice, that the world in which we are placed is filled with innumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able objects, that are proper to raiſe and keep alive this happy temper of mind.</p>
               <p>If we conſider the world in its ſubſerviency to man, one would think it was made for our uſe; but if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:029518_0022_0FE1CC05BA4BACF0"/>
it in its natural beauty and harmony, one would be apt to conclude it was made for our pleaſure. The ſun, which is as the great ſoul of the univerſe, and produces all the neceſſaries of life, has a particular influence in cheering the mind of man, and making the heart glad.</p>
               <p>Thoſe ſeveral living creatures which are made for our ſervice or ſuſtenance, at the ſame time either fill the woods with their muſic, furniſh us with game, or raiſe pleaſing ideas in us by the delightfulneſs of their appearance. Fountains, lakes, and rivers, are as refreſhing to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agination, as to the ſoil through which they paſs.</p>
               <p>There are writers of great diſtinction, who have made it an argument for Providence, that the whole earth is covered with green, rather than with any other colour, as being ſuch a right mixture of light and ſhade, that it comforts and ſtrengthens the eye, inſtead of weakening or grieving it. For this reaſon, ſeveral painters have a green cloth hanging near them, to eaſe the eye upon, after too great an application to their colouring. A fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous modern philoſopher accounts for it in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner: all colours that are more luminous, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power and diſſipate the animal ſpirits which are employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſight; on the contrary, thoſe that are more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, do not give the animal ſpirits a ſufficient exerciſe; whereas the rays that produce in us the idea of green, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>all upon the eye in ſuch a due proportion, that they give the animal ſpirits their proper play, and by keeping up the ſtruggle in a juſt balance, excite a very pleaſing and agreeable ſenſation. Let the cauſe be what it will, the effect is certain; for which reaſon the poets aſcribe to this particular colour the epithet of <hi>cheerful.</hi>

               <p>To conſider farther this double end in the works of nature, and how they are at the ſame time both uſeful and entertaining, we find that the moſt important parts in the vegetable world are thoſe which are the moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful. Theſe are the ſeeds by which the ſeveral races of plants are propagated and continued, and which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways lodged in flowers or bloſſoms. Nature ſeems to hide her principal deſign, and to be induſtrious in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap> her great work, and intent upon her own preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The huſbandman, after the ſame manner, is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in laying out the whole country into a kind of
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:029518_0022_0FE1CC05BA4BACF0"/>
garden or landſcape, and making every thing ſmile about him, whilſt, in reality, he thinks of nothing but of the harveſt and increaſe which is to ariſe from it.</p>
               <p>We may further obſerve, how Providence has taken care to keep up this cheerfulneſs in the mind of man, by having formed it after ſuch a manner as to make it capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of conceiving delight from ſeveral objects which ſeem to have very little uſe in them; as from the wildneſs of rocks and deſarts, and the like groteſque parts of nature. Thoſe who are verſed in philoſophy may ſtill carry this conſideration higher, by obſerving, that if matter had appeared to us endowed only with thoſe real qualities which it actually poſſeſſes, it would have made but a very joyleſs and uncomfortable figure; and why has Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence given it a power of producing in us impreſſions of ſuch imaginary qualities as taſtes and colours, ſounds and ſmells, heat and cold; but that man, while he is converſant in the lower ſtations of nature, might have his mind cheered and delighted with agreeable ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? In ſhort, the whole univerſe is a kind of theatre, filled with objects that either raiſe in us pleaſure, amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or admiration.</p>
               <p>The reader's own thoughts will ſuggeſt to him the viciſſitude of day and night, the change of ſeaſons, with all that variety of ſcenes which diverſify the face of nature, and fill the mind with a perpetual ſucceſſion of beautiful and pleaſing images.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not here mention the ſeveral entertainments of art, with the pleaſures of friendſhip, books, converſation, and other accidental diverſions of life, becauſe I would only take notice of ſuch incitements to a cheerful temper as offer themſelves to perſons of all ranks and conditions, and which may ſufficiently ſhew us, that Providence did not deſign this world ſhould be filled with murmurs and repinings, or that the heart of man ſhould be involved in gloom and melancholy.</p>
               <p>I the more inculcate this cheerfulneſs of temper, as it is a virtue in which our countrymen are obſerved to be more deficient than any other nation. Melancholy is a Kind of demon that haunts our iſland, and often conveys itſelf to us in an eaſterly wind. A celebrated <hi>French</hi> Noveliſt, in oppoſition to thoſe who begin their romances with the flowery ſeaſon of the year enters on his ſtory,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:029518_0023_0FE1CC08FB36CC58"/>
thus: <hi>In the gloomy month of</hi> November, <hi>when the people of</hi> England <hi>hang and drown themſelves, a diſconſolate lover walked out into the fields,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Every one ought to fence againſt the temper of his cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate or conſtitution, and frequently to indulge in himſelf thoſe conſiderations which may give him a ſerenity of mind, and enable him to bear up cheerfully againſt thoſe little evils and misfortunes which are common to human nature, and which, by a right improvement of them, will produce a ſatiety of joy, and an uninterrupted happineſs.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time that I would engage my reader to conſider the world in its moſt agreeable lights, I muſt own there are many evils which naturally ſpring up amidſt the entertainments that are provided for us; but theſe if rightly conſidered, ſhould be far from overcaſting the mind with ſorrow, or deſtroying that cheerfulneſs of temper, which I have been recommending. This interſperſion of evil with good, and pain with pleaſure, in the works of nature, is very truly aſcribed by Mr. <hi>Locke,</hi> in his Eſſay on Human Underſtanding, to a moral reaſon, in the following words:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beyond all this, we may find another reaſon</hi> why <hi>God hath ſcattered up and down</hi> ſeveral degrees of pleaſure and pain, in all the things that environ and affect us, <hi>and blended them together, in almoſt all that our thoughts and ſenſes have to do with; that we, finding imperfection, diſſatisfaction, and went of complete happineſs in all the enjoyments which the creatures can afford us, might be led to ſeek it in the enjoyment of Him,</hi> with whom there is fulneſs of joy, and at whoſe right hand are pleaſures for evermore.</p>

               <p>I OUGHT hourly to be looking up with gratitude and praiſe to the Creator of my being, for having formed me of a diſpoſition that throws off every particle of ſpleen, and either directs my attention to objects of cheerfulneſs and joy, or enables me to look upon their contraries as I do on ſhades in a picture, which add force to the lights, and beauty to the whole. With this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of conſtitution I can behold the luxury of the
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:029518_0023_0FE1CC08FB36CC58"/>
times, as giving food and clothing to the hungry and the naked; extending our commerce, and promoting and encouraging the liberal arts. I can look upon the horrors of war, as productive of the bleſſings and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of peace; and upon the miſeries of mankind, which I cannot relieve, with a thankful heart that my own lot has been more favourable.</p>
               <p>There is a paſſage in that truly original poem, called the <hi>Spleen,</hi> which pleaſes me more than almoſt any thing I have read. The paſſage is this:

               </p>
               <p>The laughing philoſopher has always appeared to me a more eligible character than the weeping one: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſit down either to laugh or to cry at the follies of mankind, as I have publicly enliſted myſelf in their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, it becomes me to adminiſter every thing in my power to relieve or cure them. For this purpoſe I ſhall here lay before my readers ſome looſe hints on a ſubject, which will, I hope, excite their attention, and contribute towards the expelling from the heart thoſe malignant and ſullen humours, which deſtroy the harmony of ſocial life.</p>
               <p>If we make obſervations on human nature, either from what we feel in ourſelves, or ſee in others, we ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that almoſt all the uneaſineſſes of mankind owe their riſe to inactivity or idleneſs of body or mind. A free and briſk circulation of the blood is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary towards the creating eaſineſs and good humour; and is the only means of ſecuring us from a reſtleſs train of idle thoughts, which cannot fail to make us burthenſome to ourſelves, and diſſatisfied with all about us.</p>
               <p>Providence has therefore wiſely provided for the gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of mankind, by compelling them to uſe that labour which not only procures them the neceſſaries of life, but peace and health to enjoy them with delight. Nay far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:029518_0024_0FE1CC0A9C91E760"/>
we find how eſſentially neceſſary it is that the greateſt part of mankind ſhould be obliged to earn their bread by labour, from the ill uſe that is almoſt univerſally made of thoſe riches which exempt men from it. Even the advantages of the beſt education are generally found to be inſufficient to keep us within the limits of reaſon and moderation. How hard do the very beſt of men find it, to force upon themſelves that abſtinence or labour which the narrowneſs of their circumſtances does not immediately compel them to? Is there really one in ten, who, by all the advantages of wealth and leiſure, is made more happy in reſpect to himſelf, or more uſeful to mankind? What numbers do we daily ſee of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, either rioting in luxury, or ſleeping in ſloth, for one who makes a proper uſe of the advantages which riches give for the improvement of himſelf, or the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of others! And how many do we meet with, who, for their abuſe of the bleſſings of life, are given up to perpetual uneaſineſs of mind, and to the greateſt agonies of bodily pain?</p>
               <p>Whoever ſeriouſly conſiders this point, will diſcover, that riches are by no means ſuch certain bleſſings as the poor imagine them to be: on the contrary, he will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that the common labours and employments of life are much better ſuited to the majority of mankind, than proſperity and abundance would be without them.</p>
               <p>It was a merciful ſentence which the Creator paſſed on man for his diſobedience, <hi>By the ſweat of thy face thou ſhalt eat thy bread;</hi> for to the puniſhment itſelf he ſtands indebted for health, ſtrength, and all the enjoyments of life. Though the firſt paradiſe was forfeited for his tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, yet by the penalty inflicted for that tranſgreſſion the earth is made into a paradiſe again, in the beautiful fields and gardens which we ſee daily produced by the labour of man.</p>
               <p>And though the ground was pronounced curſed for his diſobedience, yet is that curſe ſo ordered, as to be the puniſhment, chiefly and almoſt ſolely of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe, who, by intemperance or ſloth, inflict it upon themſelves.</p>
               <p>Even from the wants and weakneſſes of mankind are the bonds of mutual ſupport and affection derived. The neceſſities of each, which no man himſelf can ſufficiently ſupply, compel him to contribute towards the benefit of others; and while he labours only for his own advantage, he is promoting the univerſal good of all around him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="unknown:029518_0024_0FE1CC0A9C91E760"/>
Health is the bleſſing that every one wiſhes to enjoy; but the multitude are ſo unreaſonable, as to deſire to purchaſe it at a cheaper rate than it is to be obtained. The continuance of it is only to be ſecured by exerciſe or labour. But the misfortune is, that the poor are too apt to overlook their own enjoyments, and to view with envy the eaſe and affluence of their ſuperiors, not conſidering that the uſual attendants upon great fortunes are anxiety and diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>If it be true, that thoſe perſons are the happieſt who have the feweſt wants, the rich man is more the object of compaſſion than envy. However moderate his inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be, the cuſtom of the world lays him under a kind of neceſſity of living up to his fortune. He muſt be ſurrounded by an uſeleſs train of ſervants: his appetite muſt be palled with plenty, and his peace invaded by crowds. He muſt give up the pleaſures and endearments of domeſtic life, to be the ſlave and party of faction. Or, if the goodneſs of his heart ſhould incline him to acts of humanity and benevolence, he will have the frequent mortification of ſeeing his charities ill beſtowed; and by his inability to relieve all, the conſtant one of making more enemies by his refuſals, than friends by his benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. If we add to theſe conſiderations a truth, which I believe few perſons will diſpute, namely, that the greateſt fortunes, by adding to the wants of their poſſeſſors, uſually render them the moſt neceſſitous of men, we ſhall find greatneſs and happineſs to be at a wide diſtance from one another. If we carry our inquiries ſtill higher; if we examine into the ſtate of a King, and even enthrone him, like our own, in the hearts of his people; if the life of a father be a life of care and anxiety, to be the father of a people is a pre-eminence to be honored, but not envied.</p>
               <p>This happineſs of life is, I believe, generally to be found in thoſe ſtations, which neither totally ſubject men to labour, nor abſolutely exempt them from it. Power is the parent of diſquietude, ambition of diſappointment, and riches of diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>I will conclude theſe reflections with the following fable:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Labour, the offspring of want, and the mother of Health and Contentment, lived with her two daughters in a little cottage by the ſide of a hill, at a great diſtance from town. They were totally unacquainted with
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:029518_0025_0FE1CC0C3B04E300"/>
the great, and had kept no better company than the neighbouring villagers: but having a deſire of ſeeing the world, they forſook their companions and habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and determined to travel. Labour went ſoberly along the road, with Health on her right hand, who, by the ſprightlineſs of her converſation, and ſongs of cheerfulneſs and joy, ſoftened the toils of the way; while Contentment went ſmiling on the left, ſupporting the ſteps of her mother, and, by her perpetual good humour, increaſing the vivacity of her ſiſter.</p>
                  <p>In this manner they travelled over foreſts, and through towns and villages, till at laſt they arrived at the capital of the kingdom. At their entrance into the great city, the mother conjured her daughters never to loſe fight of her; for it was the will of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> ſhe ſaid, that their ſeparation ſhould be attended with the utter ruin of all three; but Health was of too gay a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to regard the counſels of Labour: ſhe ſuffered her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be debauched by Intemperance, and at laſt died in childbed of Diſeaſe. Contentment, in the abſence of her ſiſter, gave herſelf up to the enticements of Sloth, and was never heard of after: while Labour, who could have no enjoyment without her daughters, went every where in ſearch of them, till ſhe was at laſt ſeized by a laſſitude in her way, and died in miſery.</p>

               <p>A GOOD temper is one of the principal ingredients of happineſs. This, it will be ſaid, is the work of nature, and muſt be born with us: and ſo in a good meaſure it is; yet oftentimes it may be acquired with art, and always improved by culture. Almoſt every ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that attracts our notice, has its bright and its dark ſide: he that habituates himſelf to look at the diſpleaſing ſide, will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>

                  <hi>Arachne</hi> and <hi>Meliſſa</hi> are two friends. They are both of them women in years, and alike in birth, fortune, edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and accompliſhments. They were originally alike in temper too; but by different management are grown the reverſe of each other. <hi>Arachne</hi> has accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed herſelf to look only on the dark ſide of every object. If a new play or poem makes its appearance, with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand brilliancies, and but one or two blemiſhes, ſhe ſlightly ſkims, over the paſſages that ſhould give her pleaſure, and dwells upon thoſe only that fill her with diſlike. If you ſhew her a very excellent portrait, ſhe looks at ſome part of the drapery that has been neglected, or to a hand or finger which has been left unfiniſhed. Her garden is a very beautiful one, and kept with great neatneſs and elegance; but if you take a walk with her into it, ſhe talks to you of nothing but blights and ſtorms, of ſnails and catterpillars, and how impoſſible it is to keep it from the litter of falling leaves, and worm caſts. If you ſit down in one of her temples, to enjoy a delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful proſpect, ſhe obſerves to you, that there is too much wood, or too little water; that the day is too ſunny, or too gloomy; that it is ſultry or windy; and finiſhes with a long harangue upon the wretchedneſs of our climate. When you return with her to the company, in hopes of a cheerful converſation, ſhe caſts a gloom over all, by giving you the hiſtory of her own bad health, or of ſome melancholy accident that has befallen one of her daughter's children. Thus, ſhe inſenſibly ſinks her own ſpirits, and the ſpirits of all around her, and at laſt diſcovers, ſhe knows not why, that her friends are grave.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Meliſſa</hi> is the reverſe of all this. By conſtantly habit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uating herſelf to look only on the bright ſide of objects, ſhe preſerves a perpetual cheerfulneſs in herſelf, which, by a kind of happy contagion, ſhe communicates to all about her. If any misfortune has befallen her, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders it might have been worſe, and is thankful to Prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence for an eſcape. She rejoices in ſolitude, as it gives her an opportunity of knowing herſelf; and in ſociety, becauſe ſhe can communicate the happineſs ſhe enjoys. She oppoſes every man's virtues to his failings, and can find out ſomething to cheriſh and applaud in the very worſt of her acquaintance. She opens every book with a deſire to be entertained or inſtructed, and therefore ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:029518_0026_0FE1CC185ADB2328"/>
miſſes what ſhe looks for. Walk with her, though it he but on a heath or a common, and ſhe will diſcover numberleſs beauties unobſerved before in the hills, the dales, the brooks, brakes, and the variegated flowers of weeds and poppies. She enjoys every change of weather and of ſeaſon, as bringing with it ſomething of health or convenience. In converſation, it is a rule with her, never to ſtart a ſubject that leads to any thing gloomy o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> diſagreeable; you therefore never hear her repeating her own grievances, or thoſe of her neighbours, or (what is worſt of all) their faults and imperfections. If any thing of the latter kind be mentioned in her hearing, ſhe has the addreſs to turn it into entertainment, by changing the moſt odious railing into pleaſant raillery. Thus <hi>Meliſſa</hi> like the bee, gathers honey from every weed; while <hi>Arachne,</hi> like the ſpider, ſucks poiſon from the faireſt flowers. The conſequence is, that of two tempers, once very nearly allied, the one is for ever ſour and diſſatisfied, the other always gay and cheerful: the one ſpreads an univerſal gloom; the other a continual ſunſhine.</p>
               <p>There is nothing more worthy of our attention th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> this art of happineſs. In converſation as well as life, happineſs very often depends upon the ſlighteſt inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. The taking notice of the badneſs of the weather, a north-eaſt wind, the approach of winter or any trifling circumſtance of the diſagreeable kind, ſhall inſenſibly rob a whole company of its good humour, and fling every member of it into the vapours. If, therefore, we would be happy in ourſelves, and are deſirous of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that happineſs to all about us, theſe <hi>minutiae</hi> of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation ought carefully to be attended to. The bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſky, the lengthening of the days, the increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing verdure of the ſpring, the arrival of any little piece of good news, or whatever carries with it the moſt diſtant glimpſe of joy, ſhall frequently be the parent of a ſocial and happy converſation. Good manners exact from us this regard for our company. The clown may repine at the ſunſhine that ripens his harveſt, becauſe his turnips are burnt up by it; but the man of refinement will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract pleaſure from the thunder ſtorm to which he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, by remarking on the plenty and refreſhment which may be expected from ſuch a ſhower.</p>
               <p>That does good manners, as well as good ſenſe, direct
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:029518_0026_0FE1CC185ADB2328"/>
us to look at every object on the bright ſide; and by thus acting, we cheriſh and improve both the one and the other.

               <p>A FRENCH author, giving an account of a very agreeable man, in whoſe character he mingles good qualities and infirmities, rather than vices and virtues, tells the following ſtory:</p>

The fellow was a perſon of diligence and capacity, and had for ſome time addreſſed himſelf to a decayed old gentlewoman, who had a young maiden to her daughter, beauteous as an angel, not ſixteen years of age. The mother's extreme poverty, and the inſinuations of this artful lacquey, concerning the ſoft diſpoſition, and generoſity of his maſter, made her conſent to deliver up her daughter. But many were the intreaties and repreſentations of the mother to gain the child's conſent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

with ladies, expecting to be, received in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by one as agreeable as the beſt of them. When he came home, his lacquey met him with a ſaucy and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful familiarity, crying out. She is as handſome as an angel, (for there is no other ſimile on theſe occaſions) but the tender fool has wept till her eyes are ſwelled and bloated; for ſhe is a maid and a gentlewoman. With that he conducted his maſter to the room where ſhe was, and retired. The Knight, when he ſaw her bathed in tears, ſaid in ſome ſurprize, Do you not know, young woman, why you are brought hither? The unhappy maid fell on her knees, and with many interruptions of ſighs and tears ſaid to him, I know, alas! too well, why I am brought hither: my mother, to get bread for her and myſelf, has ſent me to do what you pleaſed; but I wiſh it would pleaſe Heaven I could die, before I am added to the number of thoſe miſerable wretches who live without honour! With this reflection ſhe wept anew, and beat her boſom. The Knight, ſtepping back from her, ſaid, I am not ſo abandoned as to hurt your innocence againſt your will.</p>
               <p>"The novelty of this accident ſurpriſed him into vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; and covering the young maid with a cloak, he led her to a relation's houſe, to whoſe care he recommended her for that night. The next morning he ſent for her mother, and aſked her if her daughter was a maid? The mother aſſured him, that when ſhe delivered her to his ſervant, ſhe was a ſtranger to man. Are you not then, replied the Knight, a wicked woman, to contrive the debauchery of your own child? She held down her face with fear and ſhame, and in her confuſion uttered ſome broken words concerning her poverty. To your ſhame be it, ſaid the gentleman, that you ſhould relieve your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from want by a much greater evil: your daughter is a fine young creature; do you know of none that ever ſpoke of her for a wife? The mother anſwered, There is an honeſt man in the neighbourhood that loves her, who has often ſaid he would marry her with two hundred pounds. The Knight ordered his man to reckon out that ſum, with an addition of fifty to buy the bride clothes, and fifty more as an help to her mother."</p>

               <p>A DERVISE, venerable by his age, fell ill in the houſe of a woman who had been long a widow, and lived in extreme poverty in the ſuburbs of <hi>Balſora.</hi> He was ſo touched with the care and zeal with which ſhe aſſiſted him, that at his departure he ſaid to her, I have remarked that you have wherewith to ſubſiſt alone, but that you have not ſubſiſtence enough to ſhare it with your only ſon the young <hi>Abdallah.</hi> If you will truſt him to my care, I will endeavour to acknowledge, in his perſon, the obligations. I have to you for your care of me. The good woman received this propoſal with joy; and the Derviſe departed with the young man, advertiſing her, that they muſt perform a journey which would laſt near two years. As they travelled, he kept him in affluence, gave him excellent inſtructions, cured him of a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſeaſe with which he was attacked; in fine, he took the ſame care of him as if he had been his own ſon. <hi>Abdallah</hi> a hundred times teſtified his gratitude to him for all his bounties; but the old man always anſwered, <q>My ſon, it is by actions that gratitude is proved; we ſhall ſee, in a proper time and place, whether you are ſo grateful as you pretend.</q>
               </p>
               <p>One day, as they continued their travels, they found themſelves in a ſolitary place, and the Derviſe ſaid to <hi>Abdallah,</hi> 
                  <q>My ſon, we are now at the end of our jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; I ſhall employ my prayers to obtain from heaven, that the earth may open and make an entrance wide enough to permit thee to deſcend into a place, where thou wilt find one of the greateſt treaſures that the earth incloſes in her bowels. Haſt thou courage to deſcend into this ſubterraneous vault?</q> continued he, <hi>Abdallah</hi> ſwore to him, he might depend upon his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and zeal. Then the Derviſe lighted a ſmall fire.
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:029518_0028_0FE1CC1BA25FED40"/>
into which he caſt a perfume: he read and prayed for ſome moments, after which the earth opened, and the Derviſe ſaid to him, <q>Thou mayeſt now enter, my dear <hi>Abdallah;</hi> remember that it is in thy power to do me a great ſervice; and that this is, perhaps, the only op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But forgetting what had been expreſsly recommended to him, whilſt he was filling his veſt and his boſom with gold and jewels, which this ſubterraneous vault incloſed in prodigious heaps, the opening by which he entered cloſed of itſelf. He had, however, preſence of mind enough to ſeize upon the iron candleſtick, which the Derviſe had ſo ſtrongly recommended to him; and though the ſituation he was in was very terrible, he did not abandon himſelf to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair; and thinking only in what manner he ſhould get out of a place which might become his grave, he thought that the vault had cloſed only becauſe he had not follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the order of the Derviſe; he recalled to his memory the care and goodneſs he had loaded him with; reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf with his ingratitude, and finiſhed his medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by humbling himſelf before God. At length, after much pains and inquietude, he was fortunate enough to find a narrow paſſage which led him out of this obſcure cave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> though it was not till he had followed it a conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable way, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e perceived a ſmall opening covered with briars and thorns, through which he returned to the light of the ſun. He looked on all ſides, to ſee if he could perceive the Derviſe, but in vain; he deſigned to deliver to him the iron candleſtick he ſo much wiſhed for, and formed a deſign of quitting him, being rich enough with what he had taken out of the cavern, to live in affluence without his aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>Not perceiving the Derviſe, nor remembering any of the places through which he had paſſed, he went on as fortune had directed him, and was extremely aſtoniſhed to find himſelf oppoſite to his mother's houſe, which
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:029518_0028_0FE1CC1BA25FED40"/>
he imagined he was at a great diſtance from. She imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately inquired after the holy Derviſe. <hi>Abdallah</hi> told her frankly what had happened to him, and the danger he had run to ſatisfy his unrea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>onable deſires; he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſhewed her the riches with which he was loaded. His mother concluded, upon the ſight of them, that the Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe only deſigned to make trial of his courage and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and that they ought to make uſe of the happineſs which fortune had preſented to them; adding, that doubtleſs ſuch was the intention of the holy Derviſe. While they contemplated upon theſe treaſures with avid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity; while they were dazzled with the luſtre of them, and formed a thouſand projects in conſequence of them, they all vaniſhed away before their eyes. It was then that <hi>Abdallah</hi> ſincerely reproached himſelf for his ingrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itude and diſobedience; and perceiving that the iron candleſtick had reſiſted the inchantment, or rather the juſt puniſhment which thoſe deſerve who do not execute what they promiſe, he ſaid, proſtrating himſelf—<q>What has happened to me is juſt; I have loſt what I had no deſign to reſtore, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d the candleſtick which I intended to deliver to the Derviſe remains with me: it is a proof that it rightly belongs to him, and that the reſt was unjuſtly acquired.</q> As he finiſhed theſe words, he placed the candleſtick in the midſt of their little houſe.</p>
               <p>When the night was come, without reflecting upon it, he placed the light in the candleſtick. Immediately they ſaw a Derviſe appear, who turned round for an hour, and diſappeared, after having thrown them an aſper. The candleſtick had twelve branches. <hi>Abdallah,</hi> who was meditating all the day upon what he had ſeen the night before, was willing to know what would happen the next night, if he put a light in each of them; he did ſo, and twelve Derviſes appeared that inſtant; they turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed round alſo for an hour, and each of them threw an aſper as they diſappeared. He repeated every day the ſame ceremony, which had always the ſame ſucceſs, but he never could make it ſucceed more than once in twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four hours. This trifling ſum was enough to make his mother and himſelf ſubſiſt tolerably: there was a time when they would have deſired no more to be happy; but it was not conſiderable enough to change their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.

The ſight of what he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved he ſhould poſſeſs; the projects he had formed for the employment of it; all theſe things had left ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found traces in the mind of <hi>Abdallah,</hi> that nothing could efface them. Therefore, ſeeing the ſmall advantage he drew from the candleſtick, he reſolved to carry it back to the Derviſe, in hopes that he might obtain of him the treaſure he had ſeen, or at leaſt find again the riches which had vaniſhed from their ſight, by reſtoring to him a thing for which he teſtified ſo earneſt a deſire. He was ſo fortunate as to remember his name, and that of the city where he inhabited. He departed therefore imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately for <hi>Magrebi,</hi> carrying with him his candleſtick, which he lighted every night, and by that means fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed himſelf with what was neceſſary on the road, without being obliged to implore the aſſiſtance and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of the faithful.</p>

He repaired thither directly, and found fifty porters who kept the gate of his houſe, having each a ſtaff with a head of gold in their hands: the court of his palace was filled with ſlaves and domeſtics; in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

As to me, I never deſired it, but to place it in my chamber, as a taliſman compoſed by a ſage whom I revere, and am pleaſed to expoſe it ſometimes to thoſe who come to viſit me; and to prove to thee, added he, that curioſity was the only occaſion of my ſearch for it, here are the keys of my magazines, open them, and thou ſhalt judge of my riches; thou ſhalt tell me whether the moſt inſatiable miſer would not be ſatisfied with them.</q> 
                  <hi>Abdallah</hi> obeyed him, and examined twelve magazines of great extent, ſo full of all manner of riches, that he could not diſtinguiſh what merited his admiration moſt; they all deſerved it, and produced new deſires. The regret of having reſtored the candleſtick, and that of not having found out the uſe of it, pierced the heart of <hi>Abdallah. Abounadar</hi> ſeemed not to perceive it: on the contrary, he loaded him with careſſes, kept him ſome days in his houſe, and commanded him to be treated as himſelf. When he was at the eve of the day which he had fixed for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, he ſaid to him, <q>
                     <hi>Abdallah,</hi> my ſon, I believed, by what has happened to thee, thou art corrected of the frightful vice of ingratitude; however, I owe thee a mark of my affection, for having undertaken ſo long a journey, with a view of bringing me the thing I had deſired; thou mayeſt depart, I ſhall detain thee no longer. Thou ſhalt find to-morrow, at the gate of my palace, one of my horſes to carry thee; I make thee a preſent of it, as well as of a ſlave who ſhall conduct thee to thy houſe; and two camels loaded with gold and jewels, which thou ſhalt chuſe thyſelf out of my treaſures.</q> 
                  <hi>Abdallah</hi> ſaid to him all that a heart ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to avarice could expreſs, when its paſſion was ſatisfied, and went to lie down till the morning arrived which was fixed for his departure.</p>
               <p>During the night he was ſtill agitated, without being
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:029518_0030_0FE1CC2821B69D80"/>
able to think of any thing but the candleſtick, and what it had produced. <q>I had it, ſaid he, ſo long in my power; <hi>Abounadar,</hi> without me, had never been the poſſeſſor of it: what riſks did I not run in the ſubterraneous vault? Why does he now poſſeſs this treaſure of treaſures? Becauſe I had the probity, or rather the folly, to bring it back to him. He profits by my labour, and the danger I have incurred in ſo long a journey: and what does he give me in return? Two camels loaded with gold and jewels; in one moment the candleſtick will furniſh him with ten times as much. It is <hi>Abounadar</hi> who is ungrateful: what wrong ſhall I do him in taking this candleſtick? None certainly; for he is rich: and what do I poſſeſs?</q> Theſe ideas determined him, at length, to make all poſſible attempts to ſeize upon the candleſtick. The thing was not difficult, <hi>Abounadar</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truſted him with the keys of his magazines. He knew where the candleſtick was placed; he ſeized upon it, hid it in the bottom of one of the ſacks, which he filled with pieces of gold and other riches that he was allowed to take, and loaded it, as well as the reſt, upon his camels. He had no other eagerneſs now than for his departure; and after having haſtily bid adieu to the generous <hi>Abouna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar,</hi> he delivered him his keys, and departed with his horſe, and ſlave, and two camels.</p>
               <p>When he was ſome days journey from <hi>Balſora,</hi> he ſold his ſlave, reſolving not to have a witneſs of his former poverty, nor of the ſource of his preſent riches. He bought another, and arrived without any obſtacle, at his mother's, whom he would ſcarce look upon, ſo much was he taken up with his treaſure. His firſt care was to place the loads of his camels, and the candleſtick, in the moſt private room of the houſe; and, in his impatience to feed his eyes with his great opulence, he placed lights imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately in the candleſtick: the twelve Derviſes appearing, he gave each of them a blow with a cane with all his ſtrength, leſt he ſhould be failing in the laws of the taliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: but he had not remarked that <hi>Abounadar,</hi> when he ſtruck them, had the cane in his left hand. <hi>Abdallah,</hi> by a natural motion, made uſe of his right; and the Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes, inſtead of becoming heaps of riches, immediately drew from beneath their robes each a formidable club, with which they ſtruck him ſo hard and ſo long, that they

left him almoſt dead, and diſappeared, carrying with them all his treaſure, the camels, the horſe, the ſlave, and the candleſtick.</p>
               <p>Thus was <hi>Abdallah</hi> puniſhed by poverty, and almoſt by death; for his unreaſonable ambition, which perhaps might have been pardonable, if it had not been accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by an ingratitude as wicked as it was audacious; ſince he had not ſo much as the reſource of being able to conceal his perfidies from the too piercing eyes of his benefactor.</p>

               <p>THERE is not a common ſaying which has a better turn of ſenſe in it, than what we often hear in the mouths of the vulgar, that <hi>cuſtom is a ſecond nature.</hi> It is indeed able to form the man a new, and give him inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and capacities altogether different from thoſe he was born with. Dr. <hi>Plot,</hi> in his hiſtory of <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> tells us of an idiot that chanced to live within the ſound of a clock, and always amuſed himſelf with counting the hour of the day whenever the clock ſtruck; the clock being ſpoiled by ſome accident, the idiot continued to ſtrike and count the hour without the help of it, in the ſame manner as he had done when it was entire. Though I dare not vouch for the truth of this ſtory, it is very certain, that cuſtom has a mechanical effect upon the body, at the ſame time that it has a very extraordinary influence upon the mind.</p>
               <p>I ſhall in this paper conſider one very remarkable effect which cuſtom has upon human nature; and which, if rightly obſerved, may lead us into very uſeful rules of life. What I ſhall here take notice of in cuſtom, is its wonderful efficacy in making every thing pleaſant to us. A perſon who is addicted to play or gaming, though he took but little delight in it at firſt, by degrees contracts ſo ſtrong an inclination towards it, and gives himſelf up ſo entirely to it, that it ſeems the only end of his being. The love of a retired or buſy life will grow upon a man inſenſibly, as he is converſant in the one or the other, till he is utterly unqualified for reliſhing that to which he has
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:029518_0031_0FE1CC2B7177B240"/>
been for ſome time diſuſed. Nay, a man may ſmoke, or drink, or take ſnuff, till he is unable to paſs away his time without it, not to mention how our delight in any particular ſtudy, art, or ſcience, riſes and improves in proportion to the application which we beſtow upon it. Thus, what was at firſt an exerciſe, becomes at length an entertainment. Our employments are changed into our diverſions. The mind grows fond of thoſe actions ſhe is accuſtomed to; and is drawn with reluctancy from thoſe paths in which ſhe has been uſed to walk.</p>
               <p>Not only ſuch actions as were at firſt indifferent to us, but even ſuch as were painful, will, by cuſtom and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, become pleaſant. Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> obſerves in his Natural Philoſophy, that our taſte is never pleaſed better than with thoſe things which at firſt created a diſguſt in it. He gives particular inſtances of claret, coffee, and other liquors, which the palate ſeldom approves upon the firſt taſte; but when it has once got a reliſh of them, generally retains it for life. The mind is conſtituted after the ſame manner, and after having habituated herſelf to any particular exerciſe or employment, not only loſes her firſt averſion towards it, but conceives a certain fondneſs and affection for it. I have heard one of the greateſt geniuſes this age has produced, who had been trained up in all the polite ſtudies of antiquity, aſſure me, upon his being obliged to ſearch into ſeveral rolls and records, that notwithſtanding ſuch an employment was at firſt very dry and irkſome to him, he at laſt took an incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pleaſure in it, and preferred it even to the reading of <hi>Virgil</hi> or <hi>Cicero.</hi> The reader will obſerve, that I have not here conſidered cuſtom as it makes things eaſy, but as it renders them delightful; and though others have often made the ſame reflection, it is poſſible they may not have drawn thoſe uſes from it, with which I intend to fill the remaining part of this paper.</p>
               <p>If we conſider attentively this property of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it may inſtruct us in very fine morality.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, I would have no man diſcouraged with that kind of life or ſeries of action, in which the choice of others, or his own neceſſities, may have enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him. It may, perhaps, be very diſagreeable to him at firſt; but uſe and application will certainly render it not only leſs painful, but pleaſing and ſatisfactory.</p>

Perhaps this raillery is purſued too for, yet it is turned upon a very obvious remark, that a woman's ſtrongeſt paſſion is for her own beauty, and that ſhe values it as her favorite diſtinction. From hence it is, that all arts, which pretend to improve or preſerve it, meet with ſo general a reception among the ſex. To ſay nothing of many falſe helps, and contraband wares of beauty, which are daily vended in this great market, there is not a maiden gentlewoman, of a good family, in any county of <hi>South Britain,</hi> who has not heard of the virtue of <hi>May dew,</hi> or is unfurniſhed with ſome receipt or other in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of her complexion: and I have known a phyſician of learning and ſenſe, after eight years ſtudy in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, and a courſe of travels into moſt countries in <hi>Europe,</hi> owe the firſt riſing of his fortune to a coſmetic waſh.</p>
               <p>This has given me occaſion to conſider, how ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal a diſpoſition in woman-kind, which ſprings from a laudable motive, the deſire of pleaſing, and proceeds from an opinion not altogether groundleſs, that nature, helped by art, may be turned to their advantage. And, methinks, is would be an acceptable ſervice to take them out of the hands of quacks and pretenders, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their impoſing upon themſelves, by diſcovering to them the true ſecret and art of improving beauty.</p>
               <p>In order to do this, before I touch upon it directly, it will be neceſſary to lay down a few preliminary maxims, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
               </p>
               <p>That no woman can be <hi>handſome</hi> by the force of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures alone, any more than ſhe can be <hi>witty</hi> only by the help of ſpeech.</p>
               <p>That pride deſtroys all ſymmetry and grace, and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is a more terrible enemy to fine faces than the ſmall-pox.</p>
               <p>That no woman is capable of being <hi>beautiful</hi> who is not incap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ble of being <hi>falſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, that what would be <hi>odious</hi> in a friend, is <hi>deformity</hi> in a miſtreſs.</p>
               <p>From theſe few principles, thus laid down, it will be eaſy to prove, that the true art of aſſiſting beauty, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:029518_0034_0FE1BA0D1B023328"/>
in embelliſhing the whole perſon, by the proper ornaments of virtuous and commendable qualities. By this help alone it is, that thoſe who are the favourite work of nature, or, as Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> expreſſes it, the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celain clay of human kind, become animated, and are in a capacity of exerting their charms; and thoſe who ſeem to have been neglected by her, like models wrought in haſte, are capable, in a great meaſure, of finiſhing what ſhe has left imperfect.</p>
               <p>It is, methinks, a low and degrading idea of that ſex, which was created to refine the joys, and ſoften the cares of humanity, by the moſt agreeable participation, to conſider them merely as objects of ſight. This is abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them of their natural extent of power, to put them upon a level with their pictures at <hi>Knellers's.</hi> How much nobler is the contemplation of beauty heightened by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and commanding our eſteem and love, while it draws our obſervation! how faint and ſpiritleſs are the charms of a coquette, when compared with the real lovelineſs of <hi>Sophronia's</hi> innocence, piety, good-humour, and truth; virtues which add a new ſoftneſs to her ſex, and even beautify her beauty! that agreeableneſs, which muſt otherwiſe have appeared no longer in the modeſt virgin, is now preſerved in the tender mother, the prudent friend, and the faithful wife. Colours artfully ſpread upon canvas, may entertain the eye, but not affect the heart; and ſhe who takes no care to add to the natural graces of her perſon any excellent qualities, may be allowed ſtill to amuſe as a picture, but not to triumph as a beauty.</p>

               <p>A LATE converſation which I fell into, gave me an opportunity of obſerving a great deal of beauty in a very handſome woman, and as much wit in an ingenious man, turned into deformity in the one, and abſurdity in the other, by the mere force of affectation. The fair one had ſomething in her perſon upon which her thoughts were fixed, that ſhe attempted to ſhew to advantage in every lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k, word, and geſture. The gentleman was as diligent to do juſtice to his fine parts as the lady to her beauteous form. You might ſee his imagination on the ſtretch to find out ſomething uncommon, and what they call bright, to entertain her; while ſhe writhed herſelf into as many different poſtures to engage him. When ſhe laughed, her lips were to ſever at a greater diſtance than ordinary to ſhew her teeth: her fan was to point to ſomething at a diſtance, that in the reach ſhe might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the roundneſs of her arm; then ſhe is utterly miſtaken in what ſhe ſaw, falls back, ſmiles at her own folly, and is ſo wholly diſcompoſed, that her tucker is to be adjuſted, her boſom expoſed, and the whole woman put into new airs and graces. While ſhe was doing this, the gallant had time to think of ſomething very pleaſant to ſay next to her, or make ſome unkind obſervation on ſome other lady to feed her vanity. Theſe unhappy effects of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, naturally led me to look into that ſtrange ſtate of mind which ſo generally diſcolours the behaviour of moſt people we meet with.</p>
               <p>The learned Dr.<hi>Burnet,</hi> in his theory of the earth, takes occaſion to obſerve, that every thought is attended with
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:029518_0035_0FE1CC421191B9F8"/>
conſciouſneſs and repreſentativeneſs. The mind has nothing preſented to it, but what is immediately followed by a reflection or conſcience, which tells you whether that which was ſo preſented is graceful or unbecoming. This act of the mind diſcovers itſelf in the geſture by a proper behaviour in thoſe whoſe conſciouſneſs goes no further than to direct them in the juſt progreſs of their preſent thought or action; but betrays an interruption in every ſecond thought, when the conſciouſneſs is employed in too fondly approving a man's own conceptions; which ſort of conſciouſneſs is what we call Affectation.</p>
               <p>As the love of praiſe is implanted in our boſom as a ſtrong incentive to worthy actions, it is a very difficult taſk to get above a deſire of it for things that ſhould be wholly indifferent. Women, whoſe hearts are fixed upon the pleaſures they have in the conſciouſneſs that they are the objects of love and admiration, are ever changing the air of their countenances, and altering the attitude of their bodies, to ſtrike the hearts of their beholders with new ſenſe of their beauty. The dreſſing part of our ſex, whoſe minds are the ſame with the ſillier part of the other, are exactly in the like uneaſy condition to be regarded for a well tied cravat, a hat cocked with an unuſual briſkneſs, a very well choſen coat, or other inſtances of merit, which they are impatient to ſee unobſerved.</p>
               <p>But this apparent affectation, ariſing from an ill-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conſciouſneſs, is not ſo much to be wondered at, in ſuch looſe and trivial minds as theſe: but when you ſee it reign in characters of worth and diſtinction, it is what you cannot but lament, nor without ſome indignation. It creeps into the heart of the wiſe man, as well as that of the coxcomb. When you ſee a man of ſenſe look about for applauſe, and diſcover an it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ing inclination to be commended, lay traps for a little increaſe, even from thoſe whoſe opinion he values in nothing but his own favour; who is ſafe againſt this weakneſs? Or who knows whether he is guilty of it or not? The beſt way to get clear of ſuch a light fondneſs for applauſe, is, to take all poſſible care to throw off the love of it upon occaſions that are not in themſelves laudable; but, as it appears, we hope for no praiſe from them. Of this nature are all graces in men's p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ons, dreſs, and bodily deportments; which will naturally be winning and attractive if men think not of
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:029518_0036_0FE1CC4440071098"/>
them, but loſe their force in proportion to our endeavours to make them ſuch.</p>
               <p>When our conſciouſneſs turns upon the main deſign of life, and our thoughts are employed upon the chief pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, either in buſineſs or pleaſure, we ſhall never betray an affectation, for we cannot be guilty of it; but when we give the paſſion for praiſe an unbridled liberty, our pleaſure, in little perfections, robs us of what is due to us for great virtues and worthy qualities. How many excellent ſpeeches and honeſt actions are loſt for want of being indifferent where we ought! Men are oppreſſed with regard to their way of ſpeaking and acting, inſtead of having their thoughts bent upon what they ſhould do or ſay; and by that means bury a capacity for great things by their fear of failing in indifferent things. This, perhaps, cannot be called Affectation; but it, has ſome tincture of it, at leaſt, ſo far, as that their fear of erring in a thing of conſequence argues they would be too much pleaſed in performing it.</p>
               <p>It is only from a thorough diſregard to himſelf in ſuch particulars, that man can act with a laudable ſufficiency; his heart is fixed upon one point in view; and he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits no error, becauſe he thinks nothing an error but what deviates from that intention.</p>
               <p>The wild havoc affectation makes in that part of the world which ſhould be moſt polite, is viſible wherever we turn our eyes: it puſhes men not only into imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence in converſation, but alſo in their premeditated ſpeeches. At the bar it torments the bench, whoſe buſineſs it is to cut off all ſuperfluities in what is ſpoken before it by the practitioner; as well as ſeveral little pieces of injuſtice which ariſe from the law itſelf. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>MODESTY is not only an ornament, but alſo a guard to virtue. It is a kind of quick and delicate <hi>feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in the ſoul, which makes her ſhrink and withdraw herſelf from every thing that has danger in it. It is ſuch an exquiſite ſenſibility, as warns her to ſhun the firſt appearance of every thing that is hurtful.</p>
               <p>I cannot at preſent recollect either the place or time of what I am going to mention; but I have read ſomewhere in the hiſtory of ancient <hi>Greece,</hi> that the women of the
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:029518_0037_0FE1CC45DC9AAD78"/>
country were ſeized with an unaccountable melancholy, which diſpoſed ſeveral of them to make away with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The Senate, after having tried many expedients to prevent this ſelf-murder, which was ſo frequent among them, publiſhed an edict, that if any women whomſoever ſhould lay violent hands upon herſelf, her corpſe ſhould be expoſed naked in the ſtreet, and dragged about the city in the moſt public manner. This edict immediately put a ſtop to the practice which was before ſo common. We may ſee in this inſtance the ſtrength of female modeſty, which was able to overcome the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence even of madneſs and deſpair. The fear of ſhame, in the fair ſex, was, in thoſe days, more prevalent than that of death.</p>
               <p>If modeſty has ſo great an influence over our actions, and is in many caſes, ſo impregnable a fence to virtue, what can more undermine morality than that politeneſs which reigns among the unthinking part of mankind, and treats as unfaſhionable the moſt ingenious part of our behaviour; which recommends impudence as good-breeding, and keeps a man always in countenance, not becauſe he is innocent, but becauſe he is ſhameleſs?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seneca</hi> thought modeſty ſo great a check to vice, that he preſcribed to us the practice of it in ſecret, and adviſes us to raiſe it in ourſelves upon imaginary occaſions, when ſuch as are real do not offer themſelves: for this is the meaning of his precept, that when we are by ourſelves, and in our greateſt ſolitudes, we ſhould fancy that Can ſtands before us, and ſees every thing we do. In ſhort, if you baniſh modeſty out of the world, ſhe carries away with her half the virtues that are in it.</p>
               <p>After thoſe reflections on modeſty, as it is a virtue, I muſt obſerve, that there is a vicious modeſty, which juſtly deſerves to be ridiculed, and which thoſe perſons very often diſcover who value themſelves moſt upon a well-bre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

This happens when a man is aſhamed to act up to his reaſon, and would not, upon any conſideration, be ſurpriſed in the practice of thoſe duties, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of which he was ſent into the world. Many a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="73" facs="unknown:029518_0037_0FE1CC45DC9AAD78"/>
are carefully avoided by this ſet of ſhame faced people, as what would diſparage their gaiety of temper, and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly bring them to diſhonour.

               <p>An eminent citizen, who had lived in good faſhion and credit, was, by a train of accidents, and by an una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable perplexity in his affairs, reduced to a low con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. There is a modeſty uſually attending faultleſs poverty, which made him rather chuſe to reduce his manner of living to his preſent circumſtances, than ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icit his friends in order to ſupport the ſhew of an eſtate when the ſubſtance was gone. His wife, who was a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of ſenſe and virtue, behaved herſelf on this occaſion with uncommon decency, and never appeared ſo amiable
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:029518_0038_0FE1CC535AB35B90"/>
in his eyes as now. Inſtead of upbraiding him with the ample fortune ſhe had brought, or the many great offers ſhe had refuſed for his ſake, ſhe redoubled all the inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of her affection, while her huſband was continually pouring out his heart to her in complaints that he had ruined the beſt woman in the world. He ſometimes came home at a time ſhe did not expect him, and ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her in tears, which ſhe endeavoured to conceal, and always put on an air of cheerfulneſs to receive him. To leſſen their expences, their eldeſt daughter, (whom I ſhall call <hi>Amanda</hi>) was ſent into the country, to the houſe of an honeſt farmer, who had married a ſervant of the family. This young woman was apprehenſive of the ruin which was approaching, and had privately engaged a friend in the neighbourhood, to give her an account of what paſſed from time to time of her father's affairs. <hi>Amanda</hi> was in the bloom of her youth and beauty, when the lord of the manor, who often called in at the farmer's houſe as he followed his country ſports, fell paſſionately in love with her. He was a man of great generoſity; but from a looſe education, had contracted an hearty averſion to marriage. He therefore entertained a deſign upon <hi>Amanda's</hi> virtue, which at preſent he thought fit to keep private. The innocent creature, who never ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected his intentions, was pleaſed with his perſon; and having obſerved his growing paſſion for her, hoped, by ſo advantageous a match, ſhe might quickly be in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of ſupporting her impoveriſhed relations. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> day as he called to ſee her, he found her in tears over a letter ſhe had juſt received from her friend, which gave an account that her father had lately been ſtripped of every thing by an execution. The lover, who with ſome difficulty found out the cauſe of her grief, took this occaſion to make her a propoſal. It is impoſſible to expreſs <hi>Amanda's</hi> confuſion, when ſhe found his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were not honourable. She was now deſerted of all her hopes, and had no power to ſpeak: but ruſhing from him in the utmoſt diſturbance, locked herſelf up in a chamber. He immediately diſpatched a meſſenger to her father with the following letter:</p>

                     <p>Your father and I have juſt now received a letter from a gentleman who pretends love to you, with a propoſal that inſults our misfortunes, and would throw us to a lower degree of miſery than any thing which is come upon us. How could this barbarous man think, that the tendereſt of parents would be tempted to ſupply their wants, by giving up the beſt of children to infamy and ruin? It is a mean and cruel artifice, to make this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal at a time when he thinks our neceſſities muſt compel us to any thing; but we will not eat the bread of ſhame; and therefore we charge thee not to think of us, but to avoid the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I have been interrupted: I know not how I was moved to ſay things would mend. As I was going on, I was ſtartled by a noiſe of one that knocked at the door, and has brought us an unexpected ſupply of a debt which had long been owing. Oh! I will now tell thee all. It is ſome days I have lived almoſt without ſupport, having conveyed what little money I could raiſe to your poor father. Thou wilt weep to think where he is; yet be aſſured he will be ſoon at liberty. That cruel letter would have broken his heart; but I have concealed it from him. I have no companion at preſent beſide little <hi>Fanny,</hi> who ſtands watching my looks as I write, and is crying for her ſiſter: ſhe ſays ſhe is ſure you are not well, having diſcovered that my preſent trouble is about you. But do not think that I would thus repeat my ſorrows to

He would not part with it, but upon condition that ſhe would read it without leaving the room. While ſhe was peruſing it, he fixed his eyes on her face with the deepeſt attention: her concern gave a new ſoftneſs to her beauty; and when ſhe burſt into tears, he could no longer refrain from bearing a part in her ſorrow, and telling her, that he too had read the letter, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to make reparation for having been the occaſion of it.

               <p>I HAVE heard that nothing gives an author ſo great pleaſure as to find his works reſpectfully quoted by many learned authors. This pleaſure I have ſeldom enjoyed; for though I have been, if I may ſay it without vanity, an eminent author (of Almanacks) annually, now a full quarter of a century, my brother authors in the ſame way, for what reaſon I know not, have ever been very ſparing in their applauſes, and no other au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has taken the leaſt notice, of me; ſo that did not my writings produce me ſome ſolid pudding, the great deficiency of praiſe would have quite diſcouraged me.</p>
               <p>I concluded at length, that the people were the beſt judges of my merit, for they buy my works; and beſides, in my rambles, where I am not perſonally known, I have frequently heard one or other of my adages repeated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with, <hi>as poor Richard ſays,</hi> at the end of it; this gave me ſome ſatisfaction, as it ſhewed not only that my inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were regarded, but diſcovered likewiſe ſome reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect for my authority; and I own, that to encourage the practice of remembering and repeating thoſe wiſe ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, I have ſometimes quoted myſelf with great gravity.</p>
               <p>Judge then how much I muſt have been gratified by an accident I am going to relate to you. I ſtopt my horſe lately, where a great number of people were collected at a vendue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> merchant goods. The hour of ſale not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, they were converſing on the badneſs of the
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:029518_0040_0FE1CC56E7DFAFF8"/>
times, and one of the company called to a plain clean old man, with white locks, "Pray, father <hi>Abraham,</hi> what think you of the times? Will not theſe heavy taxes quite ruin the country? How ſhall we be ever able to pay them? What would you adviſe us to?" Father <hi>Abraham</hi> ſtood up, and replied, "If you would have my advice, I will give it you in ſhort; for a word to the wiſe is enough, and many words will not fill a buſhel, <hi>as poor Richard ſays."</hi> They joined in deſiring him to ſpeak his mind, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering round him, he proceeded as follows:</p>
               <p>"Friends, ſays he, and neighbours, the taxes are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed very heavy, and if thoſe laid on by government were the only ones we had to pay, we might more eaſily diſcharge them; but we have many others, and much more grievous to ſome of us. We are taxed twice as much by our idleneſs, three times as much by our pride, and four times as much by our folly; and from theſe taxes the commiſſioners cannot eaſe or deliver us by allowing any abatement. However, let us hearken to good advice, and ſomething may be done for us. "God helps them that help themſelves," <hi>as poor Richard ſays,</hi> in his Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack for 1733.</p>
               <p>"It would be thought a hard government that ſhould tax its people one tenth part of their time, to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in its ſervice: but idleneſs taxes many of us much more, if we reckon all that is ſpent in abſolute <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>loth, or in doing of nothing, with that which is ſpent in idle employments or amuſements, that amount to nothing. Sloth, by bringing on diſeaſes abſolutely ſhortens life. "Sloth, like ruſt, conſumes faſter than labour wears, while the uſed key is always bright," <hi>as poor Richard ſays.</hi> But doſt thou love life, then do not ſquander time, for this is the ſtuff life, is made of, <hi>as poor Richard ſays.</hi> How much more than is neceſſary do we ſpend in ſleep! for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting that, "the ſleeping fox catches no poultry, and that there will be ſleeping enough in the grave," <hi>as poor Richard ſays.</hi> "If time be of all things the moſt precious, waſting time muſt be, <hi>as poor Richard ſays,</hi> the greateſt prodigality; ſince, as he elſewhere tells us, "Loſt time is never found again; and what we call time enough, always proves little enough;" let us then up and be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and doing to the purpoſe; ſo by diligence ſhall we do more with leſs perplexity. "Sloth makes all things
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:029518_0040_0FE1CC56E7DFAFF8"/>
difficult, but induſtry eaſy, <hi>as poor Richard ſays;</hi> and he that riſeth late muſt trot all day, and ſhall ſcarce over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take his buſineſs at night. While lazineſs travels ſo ſlowly, that poverty ſoon overtakes him," <hi>as we read in poor Richard,</hi> who adds, "drive thy buſineſs, let not that drive thee; and early to bed, and early to riſe, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wiſe."</p>
               <p>So that what ſignifies wiſhing and hoping for better times? We may make theſe times better if we beſtir ourſelves. "Induſtry needs not wiſh, <hi>as poor Richard ſays;</hi> and he that lives upon hope, will die faſting." There are no gains without pains; "then help hands, for I have no lands," or if I have, they are ſmartly taxed. And, <hi>as poor Richard likewiſe obſerves,</hi> "He that hath a trade hath an eſtate; and he that hath a calling hath an office of profit and honour; but then the trade muſt be worked at, and the calling well followed, or neither the eſtate nor the office will enable us to pay our taxes. If we are induſtrious we ſhall never ſtarve; for, <hi>as poor Richard ſays,</hi> "At the working man's houſe hunger looks in, but dares not enter." Nor will the bailiff or the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable enter; for, "Induſtry pays debts, while Deſpair increaſeth them," <hi>ſays poor Richard.</hi> What though you have found no treaſure, nor has any rich relation left you a legacy. "Diligence is the mother of Good luck, <hi>as poor Richard ſays,</hi> and God giveth all things to induſtry." "Then plough deep while ſluggards ſleep, and you ſhall have corn to ſell and to keep," <hi>ſays poor Dick.</hi> "Work while it is called to-day, for you know not how much you may be hindered to-morrow;" which makes <hi>poor Richard ſay,</hi> "One to-day is worth two to-morrows;"—and farther, "Have you ſomewhat to do to-morrow, do it to-day." If you were a ſervant, would you not be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a good maſter ſhould catch you idle? Are you then your own maſter, "and not aſhamed to catch yourſelf idle?" <hi>as poor Dick ſays.</hi> When there is ſo much to be done for yourſelf, your family, your country, and your gracious king, be up by peep of day: "Let not the ſun look down and ſay, Inglorious here he lies." Handle your tools without mittens; remember, "that the cat in gloves catches no mice," <hi>as poor Dick ſays.</hi> 'Tis true, there is much to be done, and perhaps you are weak-handed, but ſtick to it ſteadily, and you will ſee great
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:029518_0041_0FE1CC588895CCB8"/>
effects; for, "conſtant dropping wears away ſtones, and by diligence and patience the mouſe eats into the cable; and little ſtrokes fell great oaks." <hi>as poor Richard ſays</hi> in his Almanack, the year I cannot juſt now remember.</p>
               <p>Methinks I hear ſome of you ſay, "Muſt a man afford himſelf no leiſure?" I will tell thee, my friend, what <hi>poor Richard ſays.</hi> "Employ thy time well, if thou meaneſt to gain leiſure; and ſince thou art not ſure of a minute, throw not away an hour." Leiſure is time doing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing uſeful; this leiſure the diligent man will obtain, but the lazy man never; ſo that <hi>as poor Richard ſays,"</hi> "A life of leiſure, and a life of lazineſs are two things." Do you imagine that ſloth will afford you more comfort than labour? No, for, <hi>as poor Richard ſays,</hi> "Trouble ſprings from idleneſs, and grievous toil from needleſs eaſe. Many, without labour, would live by their wits only, but they break for want of ſtock." Whereas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry gives comfort, and plenty, and reſpect: "Fly pleaſures, and they will follow you. The diligent ſpin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner has a large ſhift; and now I have a ſheep and a cow, every body bids me good-morrow;" all which is well ſaid by <hi>poor Richard.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>And again, "three removes are as bad as a fire;" and again, "keep thy ſhop, and thy ſhop will keep thee:" and again, "if you would have your buſineſs done, go; if not, ſend;" and again,

               <p>And again, "the eye of a maſter will do more work than both his hands;" and again, "want of care does us more damage than want of knowledge;" and again, "not to overſee workmen is to leave them your purſe open." Truſting too much to others care is the ruin of many; for, as the Almanack ſays, "In the affairs of this world, men are ſaved, not by faith, but by the want
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:029518_0041_0FE1CC588895CCB8"/>
of it; but a man's own care is profitable; for, <hi>ſaith poor Dick,</hi> "Learning is to the ſtudious, and riches to the careful, as well as power to the bold, and heaven to the virtuous." And further, "If you would have a faithful ſervant, and one that you like, ſerve yourſelf." And again, he adviſeth to circumſpection and care, even in the ſmalleſt matters, becauſe ſometimes, "A little neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect may breed great miſchief; adding, for want of a nail the ſhoe was loſt; and for want of a ſhoe the horſe was loſt; for want of a horſe the rider was loſt; being overtaken and ſlain by the enemy; all for want of care about a horſe ſhoe nail."</p>
               <p>So much for induſtry, my friends, and attention to one's own buſineſs; but to theſe we muſt add frugality, if we would make our induſtry more certainly ſucceſsful. A man may, if he knows not how to ſave as he gets, keep his noſe all his life at the grindſtone, and die not worth a groat at the laſt. "A fat kitchen makes a lean will," <hi>as poor Richard ſays;</hi> and,

               <p>"If you would be wealthy, ſays he in another Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, think of ſaving as well as getting: the <hi>Indies</hi> have not made <hi>Spain</hi> rich, becauſe her outgoes are greater than her incomes." Away then with your expenſive follies, and you will not have ſo much cauſe to complain of hard times, heavy taxes and chargeable families: for, <hi>as poor Dick ſays,</hi>
                  <q>

               <p>And farther, "What maintains one vice, would bring up two children." You may think, perhaps, that a little tea, or a little punch now and then, diet a little more coſtly, clothes a little finer, and a little entertainment now and then, can be no great matter; but remember what <hi>poor Richard ſays,</hi> "Many a little makes a mickle;" and farther, "Beware of little expences; a ſmall leak will ſink a great ſhip;" and again, "Who dainties love, ſhall beggars prove;" and moreover, "Fools make feaſts, and wiſe men eat them."</p>
               <p>Here you are all got together, at this vendue of fineries

and knicknacks. You call them goods, but if you do not take care, they will prove evils to ſome of you. You expect that they will be ſold cheap, and perhaps they may for leſs than they coſt, but if you have no occaſion for them, they muſt be dear to you. Remember what <hi>poor Richard ſays,</hi> "Buy what thou haſt no need of, and ere long thou ſhalt ſell thy neceſſaries." And again, "At a great pennyworth pauſe a while:" he means, that perhaps the cheapneſs is apparently only, and not real; or the bargain, by ſtraitening thee in thy buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, may do thee more harm than good. For in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place he ſays, "many have been ruined by buying good pennyworths." Again, <hi>poor Richard ſays,</hi> "'Tis fooliſh to lay out money in a purchaſe of repentance;" and yet this folly is practiſed every day at vendues, for want of minding the Almanack. "Wiſe men, <hi>as poor Dick ſays,</hi> learn by others harms, fools ſcarcely by their own; but <hi>felix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum."</hi> Many a one, for the ſake of finery on the back, have go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> with a hungry belly, and half-ſtarved their families: "Silks and ſattins, ſcarlets and velvets, <hi>as poor Richard ſays,</hi> put out the kitchen fire." Theſe are not the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of life; they can ſcarcely be called the convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and yet only becauſe they look pretty, how many want to have them! The artificial wants of mankind thus become more numerous than the natural; and, <hi>as poor Dick ſays,</hi> "For one poor perſon, there are an hundred indigent." By theſe and other extravagancies, the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel are reduced to poverty, and forced to borrow of thoſe whom they formerly deſpiſed, but who through induſtry and frugality have maintained their ſtanding: in which caſe it appears plainly, that "a ploughman on his legs is higher than a gentleman on his knees,"<hi>as poor Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard ſays.</hi> Perhaps they have had a ſmall eſtate left them, which they knew not the getting of; they think, "It is day, and will never be night; that a little to be ſpent out of ſo much is not worth minding:" a child and a fool, <hi>as poor Richard ſays,</hi> imagine twenty ſhillings and twenty years can never be ſpent; but, always taking out of the meal tub, and never putting in, ſoon comes to the bottom; then, <hi>as poor Dick ſays,</hi> "When the well is dry, they know the worth of water." But this they might have known before, if they had taken his advice: "If you would know
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:029518_0042_0FE1CC6647B4B3B8"/>
the value of money, go and try to borrow ſome; for he that goes a-borrowing goes a-ſorrowing; and indeed ſo he does that lends to ſuch people, when he goes to get it again." <hi>Poor Dick,</hi> farther adviſes, and ſays,
<q>
                     <l>

               <p>And again, "Pride is as loud a beggar as Want, and a great deal more ſaucy." When you have bought one fine thing, you muſt buy ten more, that your appearance may he all of a piece; but <hi>poor Dick ſays,</hi> "It is eaſier to ſuppreſs the firſt deſire, than to ſatisfy all that follow it. And that it is as truly folly for the poor to ape the rich, as the frog to ſwell, in order to equal the ox."</p>

And, after all, for what uſe is the pride of appearance, for which ſo much is riſked, ſo much is ſuffered? It cannot promote health, or eaſe pain; it makes no increaſe of merit in the perſon, it creates envy, it haſtens misfortune.</p>

               <p>But what madneſs muſt it be to run in debt for theſe ſuperfluities! we are offered, by the terms of this vendue, ſix months credit; and that perhaps has induced ſome of us to attend it, becauſe we cannot ſpare the ready money, and hope now to be fine without it. But, ah! think what you do when you run in debt; you give to another power over your liberty. If you cannot pay at the time, you will be aſhamed to ſee your creditor; you will be in fear when you ſpeak to him; you will make poor, pitiful, ſneaking excuſes, and by degrees come to loſe your verac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and ſink into baſe downright lying; for, <hi>as poor Richard ſays,</hi> "the ſecond vice is lying, the firſt is running into debt." And again, to the ſame purpoſe, "lying rides upon debt's back." Whereas a freeborn <hi>Engliſhman</hi> ought not to be aſhamed or afraid to ſee or ſpeak to any
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:029518_0043_0FE1CC681A9FFE88"/>
man living. But poverty often deprives a man of all ſpirit and virtue; "It is hard for an empty bag to ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right," <hi>as poor Richard truly ſays.</hi> What would you think of that prince, or that government, who would iſſue an edict forbidding you to dreſs like a gentleman, or gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, on pain of impriſonment or ſervitude? Would you not ſay, that you are free, have a right to dreſs as you pleaſe, and that ſuch an edict would be a breach of your privileges, and ſuch a government tyrannical? And yet you are about to put yourſelves under that tyranny, when you run in debt for ſuch dreſs! your creditor has authority at his pleaſure to deprive you of your liberty, by confining you in a jail for life, or by ſelling you for a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, if you ſhould not be able to pay him. When you have got your bargain, you may, perhaps, think little of payment; but "Creditors," <hi>as poor Dick tells us,</hi> "have better memories than debtors;" and, in another place, ſays, "Creditors are a ſuperſtitious ſect, great obſervers of ſet days and times." The day comes round before you are aware, and the demand is made before you are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to ſatisfy it. Or, if you bear your debt in mind, the term which at firſt ſeemed ſo long, will, as it leſſens, appear extremely ſhort. Time will ſeem to have added wings to his heels as well as his ſhoulders. "Thoſe have a ſhort Lent, <hi>ſaith poor Richard,</hi> who owe money to be paid at <hi>Eaſter.</hi>" Then ſince, as he ſays, "The borrower is a ſlave to the lender, and the debtor to the creditor, diſdain the chain; preſerve your freedom, and maintain your independency: be induſtrious and free; be frugal and free." At preſent, perhaps, you may think yourſelf in thriving circumſtances, and that you can bear a little extravagance without injury; but,

                  <hi>As poor Richard ſays.</hi>—And when you have got the phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſopher's ſtone, ſure you will no longer complain of bad times, or the difficulty of paying taxes.</p>
               <p>This doctrine, my friends, is reaſon and wiſdom; but, after all, do not depend too much upon your own induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and frugality, and prudence, though excellent things, for they may all be blaſted without the bleſſing of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and therefore aſk that bleſſing humbly, and be not uncharitable to thoſe that at preſent ſeem to want it, but comfort and help them. Remember <hi>Job</hi> ſuffered, and was afterwards proſperous.</p>
               <p>And now to conclude, "Experience keeps a dear ſchool, but fools will learn in no other, and ſcarce in that; for it is true, we may give advice, but we cannot give conduct," <hi>as poor Richard ſays.</hi> However, remember this, "They that will not be counſelled, cannot be helped," <hi>as poor Richard ſays.</hi> And farther, "That if you will not hear Reaſon, ſhe will ſurely rap your knuckles."</p>
               <p>Thus the old gentleman ended his harangue. The people heard it, and approved the doctrine; but imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately practiſed the contrary, juſt as if it had been a common ſermon; for the vendue opened, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to buy extravagantly, notwithſtanding all his cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and their own fear of taxes. I found the good man had thoroughly ſtudied my Almanacks, and digeſted all I had dropt on theſe topics during the courſe of five-and-twenty years. The frequent mention he made of me might have tired any one elſe, but my vanity was wonderfully delighted with it, though I was conſcious that not a tenth part of the wiſdom was my own which he aſcribed to me, but rather the gleanings I had made of the ſenſe of all ages and nations. However, I reſolved to be the better for the echo of it; and though I had at firſt determined to buy ſtuff for a new coat, I went away reſolving to wear my old one a little longer. Reader, if thou wilt do the ſame, thy profit will be as great as mine.</p>

               <p>I HAD occaſion to go a few miles out of town, ſome days ſince, in a ſtage-coach, where I had for my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-travellers, a dirty bean, and a pretty young Quaker woman. Having no inclination to tal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> much at that time, I placed myſelf backward with a deſign to ſurvey them, and to pick a ſpeculation out of my two compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions. Their different figures were ſufficient of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to draw my attention. The gentleman was dreſſed in a ſuit, the ground whereof had been black, as I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from ſome few ſpaces that had eſcaped the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which was incorporated with the greateſt part of his coat: his perriwig, which coſt no ſmall ſum, was after ſo ſlovenly a manner caſt over his ſhoulders, that it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to have been combed ſince the year 1712; his linen, which was not much concealed, was daubed with plain <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> from the chin to the loweſt button; and the diamond upon his finger (which naturally dreaded the water) put me in mind how it ſparkled amidſt the rubbiſh of the mine, where it was firſt diſcovered. On the other hand, the pretty Quaker appeared in all the elegance of cleanlineſs. Not a ſpeck was to be found upon her. A clear, clean, oval face, juſt edged <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> with little thin plaits of the pureſt can bric, received great advantages from the ſhade of her black hood; as did the whiteneſs of her arms from that ſober-coloured ſtuff, in which ſhe had clothed herſelf. The plainneſs of her dreſs was very well ſuited to the ſimplicity of her phraſes; all which put together, though they could not give me a great opinion of her religion, they did of her innocence.</p>
               <p>This adventure occaſioned my throwing together a few hints upon cleanlineſs, which I ſhall conſider as one of the <hi>half-virtues,</hi> as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls them, and ſhall rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ommend it under the three following heads: as it is a mark of politeneſs; as it produces love; and as it bears analogy to purity of mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is a mark of politeneſs. It is univerſally agreed upon, that no one unadorned with this virtue can go into company without giving a manifeſt offence. The eaſier or higher any one's fortune is, this duty riſe,
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:029518_0044_0FE1CC69B9B1FD30"/>
proportionally. The different nations of the world are as much diſtinguiſhed by their Cleanlineſs, as by their arts and ſciences. The more any country is civilized, the more they conſult this part of politeneſs. We need but compare our ideas of a female <hi>Hottentot</hi> and an <hi>Engliſh</hi> beauty, to be ſatisfied of the truth of what has been advanced.</p>
               <p>In the next place, cleanlineſs may be ſaid to be the foſter-mother of love. Beauty indeed moſt commonly produces that paſſion in the mind, but cleanlineſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves it. An indifferent face and perſon, kept in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual neatneſs, hath won many a heart from a pretty flattern. Age itſelf is not unamiable, while it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved clean and unſullied: like a piece of metal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly kept ſmooth and bright, we look on it with more pleaſure than on a new veſſel that is cankered with ruſt.</p>
               <p>I might obſerve farther, that as cleanlineſs renders us agreeable to others, ſo it makes us eaſy to ourſelves; that it is an excellent preſervative of health; and that ſeveral vices deſtructive both to mind and body, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the habit of it. But theſe reflections I ſhall leave to the leiſure of my readers, and ſhall obſerve in the third place, that it bears a great analogy to purity of mind, and naturally inſpires refined ſentiments and paſſions.</p>
               <p>We find from experience, that through the prevalence of cuſtom, the moſt vicious actions loſe their horror, by being made familiar to us. On the contrary, thoſe who live in the neighbourhood of good examples, fly from the firſt appearance of what is ſhocking. It fares with us much after the ſame manner, as to our ideas. Our ſenſes which are the inlets of all the images conveyed to the mind, can only tranſmit the impreſſions of ſuch things as uſually ſurround them. So that pure and unſullied thoughts are naturally ſuggeſted to the mind, by thoſe objects that perpetually encompaſs us, when they are beautiful and elegant in their kind.</p>
               <p>In the Eaſt, where the warmth of the climate makes cleanlineſs more immediately neceſſary than in colder countries, it is made one part of their religion: the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> law, (and the <hi>Mahometan,</hi> which in ſome things copies after it) is filled with bathings, purifications, and other rites of the like nature. Though there is the above-named convenient reaſon to be aſſigned for their cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:029518_0045_0FE1CC6B5D410380"/>
the chief intention undoubtedly was to typify inward purity and cleanlineſs of heart by thoſe outward waſhings. We read ſeveral injunctions of this kind in the book of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> which confirm this truth; and which are but ill accounted for by ſaying, as ſome do, that they were only inſtituted for convenience, in the deſart, which otherwiſe could not have been habitable for many years.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude this eſſay, with a ſtory which I have ſomewhere read in an account of <hi>Mahometan</hi> ſuperſtitions.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Derviſe</hi> of great ſanctity, one morning had the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, as he took up a cryſtal cup which was conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to the prophet, to let it fall upon the ground, and daſh it to pieces. His ſon coming in, ſome time after, he ſtretched out his hand to bleſs him, as his manner was every morning; but the youth going out, ſtumbled over the threſhold, and broke his arm. As the old man wondered at theſe events, a caravan paſſed by in its way from <hi>Mecca.</hi> The <hi>Derviſe</hi> approached it to beg a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; but as he ſtroked one of the holy camels, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a kick from the beaſt that ſorely bruiſed him. His ſorrow and amazement increaſed upon him, till he recollected, that through hurry and inadvertency, he had that morning come abroad without waſhing his hands.</p>

               <p>TO be courteous to all, but familiar to few, is a max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im which I once deſpiſed, as originally proceeding from a mean and contracted mind, the frigid caution of weakneſs and timidity. A tame and indiſcriminate civ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ility I imputed to a dread of the contempt or petulency of others, to fears from which the wit and the gentleman are exempted by a conſciouſneſs of their own dignity, by their power to depreſs inſolence, and ſilence ridicule and a general ſhyneſs and reſerve, I conſidered as the reproach of our country, as the effect of an illiberal edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, by which neither a polite addreſs, an eaſy confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, nor a general acquaintance with public life are to be acquired. This opinion, which continued to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the levity and pride that produced it, was ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened

by the example of thoſe whoſe manner in the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of youth I wiſhed to imitate, who entered a mixed, company with an air of ſerene familiarity, accoſted every man like an old acquaintance, and thought only of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſport of any of the reſt with whom their caprice ſhould happen to be offended, without regard to their age, character or condition.</p>
               <p>But now I wiſh that I had regulated my conduct by the maxims which I deſpiſed, for I ſhould then have eſcaped a misfortune which I ſhall never retrieve; and the ſenſe of, which I am now endeavouring to ſuſpend, by relating it to you as a leſſon to others, and conſidering my loſs of happineſs as an acquiſition of wiſdom.</p>
               <p>While I was in <hi>France</hi> with a travelling tutor, I receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a letter which acquainted me that my father, who had been long declining, was dead; and that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary I ſhould immediately return to <hi>England,</hi> to take poſſeſſion of his eſtate, which was not inconſiderable, though there were mortgages upon it to near half its value.</p>
               <p>When I arrived, I found a letter which the old gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman had written and directed to me with his own hand. It contained ſome general rules for my conduct, and ſome animadverſions upon his own: he took notice of the incumbrances under which he left me the pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal inheritance, which had deſcended through many generations; and expreſſed the moſt earneſt deſire that it might yet be tranſmitted entire to poſterity. With this view, he ſaid, he had negociated a marriage between me and the only daughter of his old friend Sir <hi>George Homeſtead,</hi> of the North; an amiable young lady, whoſe alliance would be an honour to my family, and whoſe fortune would much more than redeem my eſtate.</p>
               <p>He had given the Knight a faithful account of his affairs, who, after having taken ſome time to conſider the propoſals, and conſult his friends, had conſented to the match, upon condition that his daughter and I ſhould be agreeable to each other, and that my behaviour ſhould confirm the character that had been given of me. My father added, that he hoped to have lived till this alliance had taken place; but as Providence had other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe determined, he intreated, as his laſt requeſt, that as ſoon as my affairs ſhould be ſettled, and decency would permit, I would make Sir <hi>George</hi> a viſit, and neglect noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to accompliſh this purpoſe.</p>

               <p>In the morning, as I was mounting, a gentleman, who had juſt got on horſeback before me, ordered his ſervant to make ſome inquiry about the road, which I happened to overhear, and told him with great familiarity, that I was going the ſame way, and if he pleaſed we would tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel together: to this he conſented, with as much frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and as little ceremony; and I ſet forward, greatly delighted that chance had afforded me a companion.</p>
               <p>We Immediately entered into converſation, and I ſoon found that he had been abroad: we extolled the roads and the polity of <hi>France,</hi> the cities, the palaces, and the villas; entered into a critical examination of the moſt celebrated ſeats in <hi>England,</hi> the peculiarity of the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ſituation, croſs ways, market towns, the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of innkeepers, and the ſports of the field: topics, by which we mutually recommended ourſelves to each other, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>e put up, and many other queſtions of the ſame kind. The gentleman, who appeared to be near fifty, received our addreſs with great coldneſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned ſhort and indirect anſwers to our inquiries, and often looking with great attention on us both, ſometimes put forward that he might get before us, and ſometimes checked his horſe that he might remain behind. But we were reſolved to diſappoint him; and finding that his reſerve increaſed, and that he was viſibly diſpleaſed, we winked at each other, and determined the old Put ſhould afford us ſome ſport. After we had rode together upon very ill terms more than half an hour, my compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, with an air of ceremonious gravity, aſked him if he knew of any houſe upon the road where he might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated with a wench. The gentleman, who was I believe afraid of giving us a pretence to quarrel, did not reſent this inſult any otherwiſe than by making no reply. I then began to talk to my companion as if we had been old acquaintances, reminding him, that the gentleman extremely reſembled a perſon from whom we had taken a girl that he was carrying to the bagnio, and indeed, that his preſent reſerve made me ſuſpect him to be ſame; but that as we were willing to aſk his pardon, we hoped it would be forgotten, and that we ſhould ſtill have the pleaſure of dining together at the next inn. The gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was ſtill ſilent; but as his perplexity and reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment viſibly increaſed, he proportionably increaſed our entertainment, which did not, however, laſt long, for he ſuddenly turned down a lane; upon which we ſet up a horſe-laugh, that continued till he was out of hearing, and then purſuing our journey, we talked of the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which afforded us converſation and merriment for the reſt of the day.</p>
               <p>The next morning we parted, and in the evening I arrived at <hi>Homeſtead-Hall.</hi> The old Knight received me with great affection, and immediately introduced me to his daughter, whom I now thought the fineſt woman I had ever ſeen. I could eaſily diſcover that I was not unwelcome to her, merely upon her father's recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and I enjoyed by anticipation the felicity which I conſidered as within my graſp. But the pleaſing ſcene, in which I had ſuffered my imagination to wander, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly

I made many attempts to diſcover the cauſe of this misfortune, but without ſucceſs; and one morning, when I had drawn Sir <hi>George</hi> into the garden by himſelf, and was about to urge him upon the ſubject, he prevented me, by ſaying, that his promiſe to my father, for whom he had the higheſt regard, as I well knew, was condition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; that he had always reſolved to leave his daughter a free choice; and that ſhe had requeſted him to acquaint me, that her affections were otherwiſe engaged, and to intreat that I would therefore diſcontinue my addreſſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. My ſurpriſe and concern at this declaration, were ſuch as left me no power to reply; and I ſaw Sir <hi>George</hi> turn from me, and go into the houſe, without making any attempt to ſtop him, or to obtain a farther explanation. Afterwards indeed, I frequently expoſtulated, intreated, and complained; but, perceiving that all was ineffectual, I took my leave, and determined that I would ſtill ſolicit by letter; for the lady had taken ſuch poſſeſſion of my heart, that I would joyfully have married her, though I had been ſure that her father would immediately have left all his fortune to a ſtranger.</p>
               <p>I meditated on my epiſtolary project all the way to <hi>London;</hi> and before I had been three days in town, I wrote a long letter to Sir <hi>George,</hi> in which I conjured him, In the ſtrongeſt terms, to account for the change in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour; and inſiſted, that, on this occaſion, to conceal the truth, was in the higheſt degree diſhonourable to himſelf, and injurious to me.</p>

               <p>CHREMYLUS, who was an old and a good man, and withal exceeding poor, being deſirous to leave ſome riches to his ſon, conſults the oracle of <hi>Apollo</hi> upon the ſubject. The oracle bid him follow the firſt man he ſhould ſee upon his going out of the temple. The perſon he chanced to ſee was to appearance an old, ſordid, blind man; but upon his following him from place to place, he at laſt found, by his own confeſſion, that he was <hi>Plutus</hi> the god of riches, and that he was juſt come out of the houſe of a miſer. <hi>Plutus</hi> further told him, that when he was a boy he uſed to declare, that as ſoon as he came to age, he would diſtribute wealth to none but virtuous and juſt men; upon which <hi>Jupiter,</hi> conſidering the pernicious conſequences of ſuch a reſolution, took his ſight away from him, and left him to ſtroll about the world in the blind condition wherein <hi>Chremylus</hi> beheld him. With much ado <hi>Chremylus</hi> prevailed upon him to go to his houſe, where he met an old woman in a tattered raiment, who had been his gueſt for many years, and whoſe name was <hi>Poverty.</hi> The old woman refuſing to turn out ſo readily as he would have her, he threatened to baniſh her, not only from his own houſe, but cut of <hi>Greece,</hi> if ſhe made any more words upon the matter. <hi>Poverty</hi> on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion pleads her cauſe very notably, and repreſents to her old landlord, that ſhould ſhe be driven out of the country, all their trades, arts, and ſciences, would be driven out with her; and that if every one was rich, they would never be ſupplied with thoſe pomps, ornaments, and convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of life, which made riches deſirable. She likewiſe repreſented the ſeveral advantages which ſhe beſtowed upon her votaries, in regard to their ſhape, their health, and their activity, by preſerving them from gouts, dropſies,
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:029518_0048_0FE1CC7DE426E9D0"/>
unwieldineſs, and intemperance. But whatever ſhe had to ſay for herſelf, ſhe was at laſt forced to move off. <hi>Chremy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> immediately conſidered how he might reſtore <hi>Plutus</hi> to his ſight; and in order to do it, conveyed him to the temple of <hi>Eſoulapius,</hi> who was famous for cures and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of this nature. By this means the deity recovered his eyes, and began to make a right uſe of them, by enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every one that was diſtinguiſhed by piety towards the gods, and juſtice towards men; and at the ſame time by taking away his gifts from the impious and undeſerving. This produced ſeveral merry incidents 'till in the laſt act <hi>Mercury</hi> deſcends with great complaints from the gods, that ſince the good men were grown rich they had received no ſacrifices, which is confirmed by a prieſt of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> who enters with a remonſtrance, that ſince theſe late innovations he was reduced to a ſtarving condition, and could not live upon his office. <hi>Chremylus,</hi> who in the beginning of the play was religious in his poverty, concludes with a propoſal which was reliſhed by all the good men, who were now grown rich as well as himſelf, (i. e.) that they ſhould carry <hi>Plutus</hi> in ſolemn proceſſion to the temple, and inſtall him in the place of <hi>Jupiter.</hi> This allegory inſtructed the <hi>Athenians</hi> in two points; firſt, as it vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the conduct of Providence in its ordinary diſtribution of wealth; and, in the next place, as it ſhewed the great tendency of riches to corrupt the morals of thoſe who poſſeſſed them.</p>

               <p>He took his agreeable voyage, and ſent home every poſt freſh accounts of his ſucceſs in his affairs abroad; but at laſt (though he deſigned to return with the next ſhip) he lamented in his letters, that buſineſs ſhould detain him ſome time longer from home, becauſe he would give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the pleaſure of an unexpected arrival.</p>
               <p>The young lady, after the heat of the day, walked every evening on the ſea-ſhore, near which ſhe lived, with a familiar friend, her huſband's kinſwoman, and diverted herſelf with what objects they met with there, or upon diſcourſe of the future methods of life in the happy change of their circumſtances. They ſtood one evening on the ſhore together in a perfect tranquillity, obſerving the ſetting of the ſun, the calm face of the deep, and the ſilent heaving of the waves, which gently rolled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, and broke at their feet; when, at a diſtance, her kinſwoman ſaw ſomething floating on the water, which ſhe fancied was a cheſt; and, with a ſmile, told her, ſhe ſaw it firſt, and if it came aſhore full of jewels, ſhe had a right to it. They both fixed their eyes upon it, and entertained themſelves with the ſubject of the wreck, the couſin ſtill aſſerting her right; but promiſing, if it was a prize, to give her a very rich coral for her child, of which ſhe was then big, provided ſhe might be godmother. Their mirth ſoon abated when they obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, upon the nearer approach, that it was a human bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. The young lady, who had a heart naturally filled with pity and compaſſion, made many melancholy reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the occaſion. Who knows, (ſaid ſhe) but this man may be the only hope and heir of a wealthy houſe, the darling of indulgent parents, who are now in imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent mirth, and pleaſing themſelves with the thoughts of offering him a bride they have got ready for him? Or, may he not be the maſter of a family that wholly depended on his life? There may, for aught we know, be half a dozen fatherleſs children, and a tender wife, now expoſed to poverty by his death. What pleaſure might he have promiſed himſelf in the different wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes

The kinſwoman immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſhrieked out. Oh, my couſin! and fell upon the ground. The unhappy wife went to help her friend, when ſhe ſaw her own huſband at her feet, and dropt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſwoon upon the body. An old woman, who had been the gentleman's nurſe, came about this time to call the ladies into ſupper, and found her child (as ſhe always called him) dead on the ſhore, her miſtreſs and kinſwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man both lying dead by him. Her loud lamentations, and calling her young maſter to life, ſoon awaked the friend from her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The villagers were aſſembled about the church, and the happy couple took a walk in a private garden. The bridegroom's man knew his maſter would leave the place on a ſudden after the wedding, and ſeeing him draw his piſtols the night before, took this opportunity to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the chamber and charge them. Upon their return from the garden, they went into the room; and after a little fond raillery on the ſubject of their courtſhip, the lover took up a piſtol, which he knew he had unloaded the night before, and preſenting it to her, ſaid with the moſt graceful air, while ſhe looked pleaſed with his agreeable flattery, Now, Madam, repent of all theſe cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties you have been guilty of to me; conſider, before you die, how often you have made a poor wretch freeze under your caſement; you ſhall die, you tyrant! you ſhall die, with all thoſe inſtruments of death and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about you, with that inchanting ſmile, thoſe killing ringlets of your hair!—Give fire, ſaid ſhe, laughing. He did ſo, and ſhot her dead. Who can ſpeak his condition! but he bore it ſo patiently as to call up his man. The poor wretch entered, and his maſter locked the door up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. <hi>Will,</hi> ſaid he, did you charge theſe piſtols! He anſwered Yes. Upon which he ſhot him dead with that remaining.—After this, amidſt a thouſand broken ſobs, piercing groans, and diſtracted motions, he wrote the following letter to the father of his dead miſtreſs:</p>

               <p>I CANNOT think it extravagant to imagine, that mankind are no leſs, in proportion, accountable for the ill uſe of their dominion over creatures of the lower rank of beings, than for the exerciſe of tyranny over their own ſpecies. The more intirely the inferior crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſubmitted to our power, the more anſwerable we ſhould ſeem for our miſmanagement of it; and the rather, as the very condition of nature renders theſe creatures incapable of receiving any recompence in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life for their ill treatment in this.</p>
               <p>It is obſervable of thoſe noxious animals which have qualities more powerful to injure us, that they naturally avoid mankind, and never hurt us, unleſs provoked or neceſſitated by hunger. Man, on the other hand, ſeeks out and purſues even the moſt inoffenſive animals, on purpoſe to perſecute and deſtroy them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montaigne</hi> thinks it ſome reflection upon human nature itſelf, that few people take delight in ſeeing beaſts careſs or play together, but almoſt every one is pleaſed to ſee them lacerate and worry one another. I am ſorry this temper has become almoſt a diſtinguiſhed character of our own nation, from the obſervation which is made by foreigners of our beloved paſtimes, bear-beating, cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fighting, and the like. We ſhould find it hard to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the deſtroying any thing that has life, merely out of wantonneſs; yet in this principle our children are bred up, and one of the firſt pleaſures we allow them is the licence of inflicting pain upon poor animals; almoſt as ſoon as we are ſenſible what life is ourſelves, we make it our ſport to take it from other creatures. I cannot but believe a very good uſe might be made of the fancy which children have for birds and inſects. Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> takes notice of a mother who permitted them to her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:029518_0051_0FE1CD105F4A9AD8"/>
but rewarded or puniſhed them as they treated them well or ill. This was no other than entering them be times into a daily exerciſe of humanity, and improving their very diverſion into a virtue.</p>
               <p>I fancy too, ſome advantage might be taken of the common notion, that it is ominous or unlucky to deſtroy ſome ſorts of birds, as ſwallows or martins; this opinion might poſſibly ariſe from the confidence theſe birds ſeem to put in us by building under our roofs, ſo that it is a kind of violation of the laws of hoſpitality to murder them. As for robin red-breaſts in particular, it is not improbable they owe their ſecurity to the old ballad of the <hi>Children in the Woods.</hi> However it be, I do not know, I ſay, why this prejudice, well improved and carried as far as it would go, might not be made to conduce to the preſervation of many innocent creatures, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

               <p>There are other animals that have the miſfortune, for no manner of reaſon, to be treated as common enemies, Wherever found. The conceit that a cat has nine lives, has coſt at leaſt nine lives in ten of the whole race of them: ſcarce a boy in the ſtreet but has in this point outdone <hi>Hercules</hi> himſelf, who was famous for killing a monſter that had but three lives. Whether the unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable animoſity againſt this uſeful domeſtic may be any cauſe of the general persecution of owls, (who are a ſort of feathered cats) or whether it be only an unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able pique the moderns have taken to a ſerious counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, I ſhall not determine; though I am inclined to believe the former; ſince I obſerve the whole reaſon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for the deſtruction of frogs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> becauſe they are like roads. Yet amidſt all the misfortunes of theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendly creatures, it is ſome happineſs that we have not yet taken a fancy to eat them; for ſhould our country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men refine upon the <hi>French</hi> ever ſo little, it is not to be conceived to what unheard-of torments, owls, cats, and frogs may yet be reſerved.</p>
               <p>When we grow up to man, we have another ſucceſſion of ſanguinary ſports; in particular hunting. I dare not attack a diverſion, which has ſuch authority and cuſtom to ſupport it, but muſt have leave to be of opinion, that the agitations of that exerciſe, with the example and number of the chaſers, not a little contribute to reſiſt thoſe checks,
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:029518_0051_0FE1CD105F4A9AD8"/>
which compaſſion would naturally ſuggeſt in behalf of the animal purſued. Nor ſhall I ſay with Monſieur <hi>Fleury,</hi> that this ſport is a remain of <hi>Gothic</hi> barbarity; but I muſt animadvert upon a certain cuſtom yet in uſe with us, and barbarous enough to be derived from the <hi>Goths,</hi> or even the <hi>Scythians;</hi> I mean the ſavage compliment our huntſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men paſs upon the ladies of quality, who are preſent at the death of a ſtag, when they put the knife into their hand to cut the throat of a helpleſs, trembling, and weeping creature,
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>—That lies beneath the knife,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Looks up, and from her butcher begs her life.</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But if our <hi>ſports</hi> are deſtructive, our <hi>gluttony</hi> is more ſo, and in a more in human manner. Lobſters roaſted alive-pigs whipt to death, fowls ſewed up, are teſtimonies of our outrageous luxury. Thoſe who (as <hi>Seneca</hi> expreſſes it) divide their lives betwixt an anxious conſcience, and a nauſeated ſtomach, have a juſt reward of their gluttony in the diſeaſes it brings with it: for human ſavages, like other wild beaſts, find ſnares and poiſons in the proviſions of life, and are allured by their appetites to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. I know nothing more ſhocking or horrid than the proſpect of one of their kitchens covered with blood, and filled with the cries of creatures expiring in tortures. It gives one an image of the <hi>Giant's</hi> den in a romance, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> with the ſcattered heads and mangled limbs of thoſe who were ſlain by his cruelty.</p>
               <p>The excellent <hi>Plutarch,</hi> (who has more ſtrokes of good-nature in his writings than I remember in any author) cites a ſaying of <hi>Cato</hi> to this effect, "That it is no eaſy taſk to preach to the belly, which has no ears. Yet if (ſays he) we are aſhamed to he ſo out of faſhion, as not to offend, let us at leaſt offend with ſome diſcretion and meaſure. If we kill an animal for our proviſion, let us do it with the meltings of compaſſion; and without tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting it. Let us conſider that it is in its own nature cruelty to put a living creature to death; we at leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy a ſoul that has ſenſe and perception." In the life of <hi>Cato</hi> the cenſor, he takes occaſion, from the ſevere diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in man, to diſcourſe in this manner: it thought to be eſteemed a happineſs to mankind, that our humanity has a wider ſphere to exert itſelf in, than bare juſtice. It
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:029518_0052_0FE1BA15EEA6DF00"/>
is no more than the obligation of our very birth to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe equity to our kind; but humanity may be extended through the whole order of creatures, even to the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt: ſuch actions of charity are the overflowings of a mild good nature on all below us. It is certainly the part of a well-natured man to take care of his horſes and dogs, not only in expectation of their labour, while they are foals and whelps, but even when their old age has made them incapable of ſervice.</p>
               <p>Hiſtory tells of a wiſe and polite nation that rejected a perſon of the firſt quality, who ſtood for a juſticiary office, only becauſe he had been obſerved in his youth to take pleaſure in tearing and murdering birds. And of another, that expelled a man out of the ſenate, for daſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a bird againſt the ground which had taken ſhelter in his boſom.</p>
               <p>Every one knows how remarkable the <hi>Turks</hi> are for their humanity of this kind: I remember an <hi>Arabian</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, who had written a treatiſe, to ſhew how far a man, ſuppoſed to have ſubſiſted in a deſart iſland, without any inſtruction, or ſo much as the ſight of any other man, may, by the pure light of nature, attain the knowledge of philoſophy and virtue. One of the firſt things he makes him obſerve, is that univerſal benevolence of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the protection and preſervation of its creatures. In imitation of which, the firſt act of virtue he thinks this ſelf-taught philoſopher would of courſe fall into, is to relieve and aſſiſt all the animals about him in their wants and diſtreſſes.</p>

               <p>I WAS laſt week taking a ſolitary walk in the gardens of <hi>Lincoln's Inn;</hi> (a favour that is indulged me by ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral of the benchers who are my intimate friends, and grown old with me in this neighbourhood) when, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the nature of men in years who have made but little progreſs in the advancement of their fortunes or their ſame, I was repining on the ſudden riſe of many perſons who are my juniors, and indeed at the unequal diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of wealth, honour, and all other bleſſings 'of life. I was loſt in this thought, when the night came upon me, and drew my mind into a far more agreeable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation. The heaven above me appeared in all its glories, and preſented me with ſuch a hemiſphere of ſtars, as made the moſt agreeable proſpect imaginable to one who delights in the ſtudy of nature. It happened to be a freezing night, which had purified the whole body of air into ſuch a bright tranſparent aether, as made every
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:029518_0053_0FE1CC8F10AD2E28"/>
conſtellation viſible; and at the ſame time, gave ſuch a particular glowing to the ſtars, that I thought it the richeſt ſky I had ever ſeen. I could not but behold a ſcene ſo wonderfully adorned and lifted up (if I may be allowed that expreſſion) without ſuitable meditations on the Author of ſuch illuſtrious and amazing objects. For, on theſe occaſions, philoſophy ſuggeſts motives to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and religion adds pleaſure to philoſophy.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as I had recovered my uſual temper and ſeren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of ſoul, I retired to my lodgings, with the ſatisfaction of having paſſed away a few hours in the proper employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a reaſonable creature; and promiſing myſelf that my ſlumbers would be ſweet; I no ſooner fell into them, but I dreamed a dream, or ſaw a viſion, (for I knew not which to call it) that ſeemed to riſe out of my even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meditation, and had ſomething in it ſo ſolemn and ſerious, that I cannot forbear communicating it; though I muſt confeſs the wildneſs of imagination (which in a dream is always looſe and irregular) diſcovers itſelf too much in ſeveral parts of it.</p>
               <p>Me thought I ſaw the ſame azure ſky diverſified with the ſame glorious luminaries which had entertained me a little before I fell aſleep. I was looking very atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively on that ſign in the heavens which is called by the name of the <hi>Balance,</hi> when on a ſudden there appeared in it an extraordinary light, as if the ſun ſhould riſe at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night. By its increaſing in breadth and luſtre, I ſoon found that it approached towards the earth; and at length could diſcern ſomething like a ſhadow hovering in the midſt of a great glory, which in a little time after I diſtinctly perceived to be the figure of a woman. I fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied at firſt it might have been the angel, or intelligence, that guided the conſtellation from which it deſcended; but, upon a nearer view, I ſaw about her all the emblems with which the Goddeſs of Juſtice is uſually deſcribed. Her countenance was unſpeakably awful and majeſtic, but exquiſitely beautiful to thoſe whoſe eyes were ſtrong enough to behold it; her ſmiles tranſported with rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; her frowns terrified to deſpair. She held in her hand a mirror, endowed with the ſame qualities as that which the painters put into the hand of Truth.</p>
               <p>There ſtreamed from it a light, which diſtinguiſhed itſelf from all the ſplendor that ſurrounded her, more
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:029518_0053_0FE1CC8F10AD2E28"/>
than a flaſh of lightning ſhines in the midſt of day-light. As ſhe moved it in her hand, it brightened the heavens, the air, or the earth. When ſhe had deſcended ſo low as to be ſeen and heard by mortals, to make the pomp of her appearance more ſupportable, ſhe threw darkneſs and clouds about her, that tempered the light into a thouſand beautiful ſhades and colours, and multiplied that luſtre, which before was too ſtrong and dazzling, into a variety of milder glories.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the world was in alarm, and all the inhabitants of it gathered together upon a ſpacious plain; ſo that I ſeemed to have the whole ſpecies before my eyes. A voice was heard from the clouds, declaring the intention of this viſit, which was to reſtore and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate to every one living what was his due. The fear and hope, joy and ſorrow, which appeared in that great aſſembly after this ſolemn declaration, are not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. The firſt edict was then pronounced, <hi>that all titles and claims to riches and eſtates, or to any part of them, ſhould be immediately veſted in the rightful owner.</hi> Upon this the inhabitants of the earth held up the inſtruments of their tenures, whether in parchment, paper, wax, or any other form of conveyance; and as the goddeſs moved the mirror of truth, which ſhe held in her hand, ſo that the light which flowed from it fell upon the multitude, they examined the ſeveral inſtruments by the beams of it: the rays of the mirror had a particular quality of ſetting fire to all forgery and falſehood. The blaze of papers, the melting of ſeals, and the crackling of parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, made a very odd ſcene. The fire very often ran through two or three lines only, and then ſtopped. Though I could not but obſerve the flames chiefly broke out among the interlineations, and codicils: the light of the mirror, as it was turned up and down, pierced into all the dark corners and receſſes of the univerſe, and by that means detected many writings and records which had been hidden or buried by time, chance, or deſign. This occaſioned a wonderful revolution among the people. At the firſt time, the ſpoils of extortion, fraud, robbery, with all the fruits of bribery and corruption, were thrown together in a prodigious pile, that almoſt reached to the clouds, and was called <hi>the mount of reſtitution;</hi> to which all injured perſons were invited, to receive what belonged to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="unknown:029518_0054_0FE1CC90B11E66E0"/>
One might ſee crowds of people in tattered garments come, up, and change cloaths with others that were dreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with lace and embroidery. Several who were plumbs, or very near it, became men of moderate fortunes; and many others, who were overgrown in wealth and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, had no more left than what they uſually ſpent. What moved my concern moſt, was to ſee a certain ſtreet of the greateſt credit in <hi>Europe,</hi> from one end to the other become bankrupt.</p>
               <p>The next command was for the whole body of mankind to ſeparate themſelves into their proper families: which was no ſooner done, but an edict was iſſued requiring all children <hi>to repair to their true and natural fathers.</hi> This put a great part of the aſſembly in motion; for as the mirror was moved over them, it inſpired every one with ſuch a natural inſtinct, as directed them to their real parents. It was a very melancholy ſpectacle to ſee the fathers of very large families become childleſs, and bach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elors undone by a charge of ſons and daughters. You might ſee a preſumptuous heir of a great eſtate aſk bleſſings of his coachman; and a celebrated toaſt paying her duty to a valet de chambre. Many, under vows of celibacy, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſurrounded with a numerous iſſue. The change of parentage would have cauſed great lamentation, but, that the calamity was pretty common; and that gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thoſe who loſt their children had the ſatisfaction of ſeeing them put into the hands of their deareſt friends. Men were no ſooner ſettled in their right to their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions and their progeny, but there was a third order proclaimed, <hi>that all the poſts of dignity and honour in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe ſhould be conferred on perſons of the greateſt merit, abilities, and perfections.</hi> The handſome, the ſtrong, and the weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, immediately preſſed forward; but not being able to bear the ſplendor of the mirror which played upon their faces, they immediately fell back upon the crowd: but as the goddeſs tried the multitude by her glaſs, as the eagle does its young ones by the luſtre of the ſun, it was remarkable, that every one turned away his face from it who had not diſtinguiſhed himſelf either by virtue, knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge, or capacity in buſineſs, either military or civil. This ſelect aſſembly was drawn up in the centre of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious multitude, which was diffuſed on all ſides, and ſtood obſerving them as idle people uſed to gather about
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:029518_0054_0FE1CC90B11E66E0"/>
a regiment that were exerciſing their arms. They were drawn up in three bodies: in the firſt were the men of virtue, in the ſecond the men of knowledge, and in the third the men of buſineſs. It was impoſſible to look at the firſt column without a ſecret veneration, their aſpects were ſo ſweetened with humanity, raiſed with contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, emboldened with reſolution, and adorned with the moſt agreeable airs, which are thoſe that proceed from ſecret habits of virtue, I could not but take notice, that there were many faces among them which were unknown, not only to the multitude, but even to ſeveral of their own body.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond column, conſiſting of the men of knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge, there had been great diſputes before they fell into their ranks, which they did not do at laſt, without the poſitive command of the goddeſs who preſided over the aſſembly. She had ſo ordered it, that men of the greateſt genius and ſtrongeſt ſenſe were placed at the head of the column: behind theſe were ſuch as had formed their minds very much on the thoughts and writings of others. In the rear of the column were men who had more wit than ſenſe, or more learning than underſtanding. All living authors of any value were ranged in one of theſe claſſes; but I muſt confeſs I was very much ſurpriſed to ſee a great body of editors, critics, commentators, and grammarians meet with ſo ill a reception. They had formed themſelves into a body, and, with a great deal of arrogance, demanded the firſt ſtation in the column of knowledge; but the goddeſs, inſtead of complying with the requeſt, clapped them all into liveries, and bid them know themſelves for no other but the lacquies of the learned.</p>
               <p>The third column were men of buſineſs, and conſiſted of perſons of military and civil capacities. The former marched out from the reſt, and placed themſelves in the front; on which the other ſhook their heads at them, but did not think fit to diſpute the poſt with them. I could not but make ſeveral obſervations upon this laſt column of people; but I have certain private reaſons why I do not think fit to communicate them to the public. In order to fill up all the poſts of honour, dignity, and profit, there was a draught made out of each column of men, who were maſters of all the three qualifications in ſome degree,
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:029518_0055_0FE1CC9254A946B0"/>
and were preferred to ſtations of the firſt rank. The ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ond draught was made out of ſuch as were poſſeſſed of any two of the qualifications, who were diſpoſed of in ſtations of a ſecond dignity. Thoſe who were left, and were endowed only with one of them, had their ſuitable poſts. When this was over, there remained many places of truſt and profit unfilled, for which there were freſh draughts made out of the ſurrounding multitude, who had any appearance of thoſe excellencies, or were recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by thoſe who poſſeſſed them in reality.</p>
               <p>All were ſurpriſed to ſee ſo many new faces in the moſt eminent dignities; and, for my own part, I was very well pleaſed to ſee that all my friends either kept their preſent poſts, or were advanced to higher.</p>
               <p>Having filled my paper with thoſe particulars of my viſion which concerned the male part of mankind, I muſt reſerve for another occaſion the ſequel of it, which relates to the fair ſex.</p>

               <p>THE male world were diſmiſſed by the goddeſs of juſtice, and diſappeared, when on a ſudden the whole plain was covered with women. So charming a multitude filled my heart with unſpeakable pleaſure; and as the celeſtial light of the mirror ſhone upon their faces, ſeveral of them ſeemed rather perſons deſcended in the trai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of the goddeſs, than ſuch as were brought before her for their trial. The clack of tongues, and confuſion of voices, in this new aſſembly, were ſo very great, that the goddeſs was obliged to command ſilence ſeveral times, and with ſome ſeverity, before ſhe could make them atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the edicts. They were all ſenſible, that the moſt important affair among womankind was then to be ſettled, which every one knows to be the point of place. This had raiſed innumerable diſputes among them, and put the whole ſex into a tumult. Every one produced her claim, and pleaded her pretenſions. Birth, beauty, wit, or wealth, were words that rang in my ears from all parts
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:029518_0055_0FE1CC9254A946B0"/>
of the plain. Some boaſted of the merit of their huſbands, others of their own power in governing them. Some pleaded their unſpotted virginity; others their numerous iſſue. Some valued themſelves as they were the mothers, and others as they were the daughters of conſiderable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. There was not a ſingle accompliſhment, unmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, or unpractiſed. The whole congregation was full of ſinging, dancing, toſſing, ogling, ſpeaking, ſmiling, ſighing, fanning, frowning, and all thoſe other irreſiſtible arts which women put in practice to captivate the hearts of reaſonable creatures. The goddeſs, to end the diſpute, cauſed it to be proclaimed, That every one ſhould take place according as ſhe was more or leſs beautiful.</p>
               <p>This declaration gave great ſatisfaction to the whole aſſembly, which immediately bridled up, and appeared in all its beauties. Such as believed themſelves graceful in their motions, found an occaſion of falling back, advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forward, or making a falſe ſtep, that they might ſhew their perſons in the moſt becoming air. Such as had fine necks and boſoms, were wonderfully curious to look over the heads of the multitude, and obſerve the moſt diſtant parts of the aſſembly. Several clapped their hands on their foreheads, as helping their ſight to look upon the glories that ſurrounded the goddeſs, but in reality to ſhew their fine hands and arms. The ladies were yet better pleaſed when they heard, that in the deciſion of this great controverſy, each of them ſhould be her own judge, and take her place according to her own opinion of herſelf, when ſhe conſulted her looking-glaſs.</p>
               <p>The goddeſs, then let down the mirror of truth in a golden chain, which appeared larger in proportion as it deſcended, and approached nearer to the eyes of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders. It was the particular property of this looking-glaſs to baniſh all falſe appearances, and ſhew people what they really are. The whole women were repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented without regard to the uſual external features, which were made entirely conformable to their real cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters. In ſhort, the moſt accompliſhed (taking the whole circle of female perfections) were the moſt beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and the moſt defective, the moſt deformed. The goddeſs ſo varied the motion of the glaſs, and placed it in ſo many different lights, that each had an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſeeing herſelf in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="unknown:029518_0056_0FE1CC93F2A68998"/>
It is impoſſible to deſcribe the rage, the pleaſure, or aſtoniſhment, that appeared in each face upon its repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation in the mirror; multitudes ſtarted at their own form, and would have broken the glaſs if they could have reached it. Many ſaw their blooming features wither as they looked upon them, and their ſelf-admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion turning into a loathing and abhorrence. The lady who was thought ſo agreeable in her anger, and was ſo often celebrated for a woman of fire and ſpirit, was fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at her own image, and fancied ſhe ſaw a fury in the glaſs. The intereſted miſtreſs beheld a Happy, and the ſubtle jilt a Sphynx. I was very much troubled in my own heart, to ſee ſuch a deſtruction of fine faces; but at the ſame time had the pleaſure of ſeeing ſeveral improved, which I had before looked upon as the greateſt maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces of nature. I obſerved that ſome few were ſo hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as to be ſurprized at their own charms; and that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a one, who had lived in the retirement and ſeverity of a veſtal, ſhined forth in all the graces and attractions of a Syren. I was raviſhed at the ſight of a particular image in the mirror, which I thought the moſt beautiful object that my eyes ever beheld. There was ſomething more than human in her countenance; her eyes were ſo full of light that they ſeemed to beautify every thing they looked upon. Her face was ſo enlivened with ſuch a florid bloom, as did not ſo properly ſeem the mark of health as of immortality. Her ſhape, her ſtature, and her whole mein, were ſuch as diſtinguiſhed her even there, where the whole fair ſex were aſſembled.</p>
               <p>I was impatient to ſee the lady repreſented by ſo divine an image, whom I found to be the perſon that ſtood at my right hand, and in the ſame point of view with myſelf. This was a little old woman, who in her prime had been about five feet high, though at preſent ſhrunk to about three quarters of that meaſure; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>IT pleaſed the mighty ſovereign <hi>Abbas-Caraſcan,</hi> from whom the kings of the earth derive honour and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, to ſet <hi>Mirza</hi> his ſervant over the province of <hi>Tauris.</hi> In the hand of <hi>Mirza</hi> the balance of diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ſplendid with impartiality; and under his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration the weak were protected, the learned receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed honour, and the diligent became rich: <hi>Mirza,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, was beheld by every eye with complacency, and every tongue pronounced bleſſings on his head. But it was obſerved that he derived no joys from the benefits which he diffuſed; he became penſive and melancholy; he ſpent his leiſure in ſolitude: In his palace he ſat motion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs upon a ſofa; and when he went out, his walk was ſlow, and his eyes were fixed upon the ground: he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the buſineſs of ſtate with reluctance; and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to relinquiſh the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> government, of which he could no longer enjoy the reward.</p>
               <p>He therefore obtained permiſſion to approach the throne of his Sovereign; and being aſked what was his requeſt, he made this reply, "May the Lord of the world forgive the ſlave whom he has honoured, if <hi>Mirza</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume he again to lay the bounty of <hi>Abbas</hi> at his feet. Thou haſt given me the dominion of a country, fruitful as the gardens of <hi>Damaſcus;</hi> and of a city, glorious above all others, except that only which reflects the ſplendor of thy preſence. But the longeſt life is a period ſcarce ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to prepare for death: all other buſineſs is vain and trivial, as the toil of emmets in the path of the trav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eller, under whoſe foot they periſh for ever; and all enjoyment is unſubſtantial and evaneſcent, as the colours of the bow that appear in the interval of a ſtorm. Suffer me therefore, to prepare for the approach of eternity; let me give up my ſoul to meditation; let ſolitude and ſilence acquaint me with the myſteries of devotion; let me forget the world, and by the world be forgotten, till the moment arrives in which the veil of eternity ſhall fall, and I ſhall be found at the bar of the Almighty." <hi>Mirza</hi> then bowed himſelf to the earth, and ſtood ſilent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="unknown:029518_0058_0FE1CCA45021F970"/>
By the command of <hi>Abbas</hi> it is recorded, that at theſe words he trembled upon that throne at the footſtool of which the world pays homage. He looked round upon his nobles; but every countenance was pale, and every eye was upon the earth. No man opened his mouth; and the King firſt broke ſilence, after it had continued an hour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>"Mirza,</hi> terror and doubt are come upon me: I am alarmed, as a man who ſuddenly perceives that he is near the brink of a precipice, and is urged forward by an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible force; but yet I know not whether my danger is a reality or a dream. I am, as thou art, a reptile of the earth; my life is a moment; and eternity, in which days and years, and ages are nothing; eternity is before me, for which I alſo ſhould prepare: but by whom the muſt the faithful be governed? By thoſe only who have no fear of judgment; by thoſe alone whoſe life is brutal; becauſe, like brutes, they do not conſider that they ſhall die. Or who, indeed, are the faithful? Are the buſy multitudes that crowd the city in a ſtate of perdition? And is the cell of the Derviſe along <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>
                  <hi>Mirza</hi> departed, and on the third day, having receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no commands, he again requeſted an audience, and it was granted. When he entered the royal preſence, his countenance appeared more cheerful; he drew a letter from his boſom, and having kiſſed it, he preſented it with his light hand.</p>
               <p>"My Lord, ſaid he, I have learned by this letter, which I received from <hi>Coſrou</hi> the Iman, who now ſtands before thee, in what manner life may be beſt improved. I am enabled to look back with pleaſure, and forward with hope; and I ſhall now rejoice ſtill to be the ſhadow of thy power at <hi>Tauris,</hi> and to keep thoſe honours which I ſo lately wiſhed to reſign." The king, who had liſtened to <hi>Mirza</hi> with a mixture of ſurprize and curioſity, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately gave the letter to <hi>Coſrou,</hi> and commanded that it ſhould be read. The eyes of the court were at once
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:029518_0058_0FE1CCA45021F970"/>
turned on the hoary ſage, whoſe countenance was ſuffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with an honeſt bluſh; and it was not without ſome heſitation that he read theſe words:</p>
               <p>"To <hi>Mirza,</hi> whom the wiſdom of <hi>Abbas</hi> our mighty Lord has honoured with dominion, be everlaſting health! When I heard thy purpoſe to withdraw the bleſſings of thy government from the thouſands of <hi>Tauris,</hi> my heart was wounded with the arrow of affliction, and my eyes became dim with ſorrow. But who ſhall ſpeak before the King, when he is troubled? And who ſhall boaſt of knowledge, when he is diſtreſſed by doubt? To thee I will relate the events of my youth, which thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed before me; and thoſe truths which they taught me, may the Prophet multiply to thee.</p>
               <p>"Under the inſtruction of the phyſician <hi>Aluazer,</hi> I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained an early knowledge of his art. To thoſe who were ſmitten with diſeaſes, I could adminiſter plants which the ſun had impregnated with the ſpirit of health. But the ſcenes of pain, languor, and mortality, which were perpetually riſing before me, made me often trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for myſelf. I ſaw the grave open at my feet: I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined therefore, to contemplate only the regions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it, and to deſpiſe every acquiſition which I could not keep. I conceived an opinion, that as there was no merit but a voluntary poverty, and ſilent meditation, thoſe who deſired money were not proper objects of boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; therefore money was deſpiſed. I buried mine in the earth; and renouncing ſociety, I wandered into a wild and ſequeſtered part of the country; my dwelling was a cave by the ſide of a hill; I drank the running water from the ſpring, and eat ſuch fruits and herbs as I could find. To increaſe the auſterity of my life, I frequently watched all night, ſitting at the entrance of the cave with my face to the eaſt, reſigning myſelf to the ſecret influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the Prophet, and expecting illumination from above. One morning after my nocturnal vigil, juſt as I perceived the horizon glow at the approach of the ſun, the power of ſleep became irreſiſtible, and I ſunk under it. I imagined myſelf ſtill ſitting at the entrance of my cell; that the dawn increaſed, and that as I looked earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly for the firſt beam of day, a dark ſpot appeared to intercept it. I perceived that it was in motion: it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in ſize as it drew near, and at length I diſcovered
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:029518_0059_0FE1CCA5EBFD2778"/>
it to be an eagle. I ſtill kept my eye fixed ſtedfaſtly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and ſaw it alight at a ſmall diſtance; where I now deſcried a fox, whoſe two fore legs appeared to be broken. Before this fox the eagle laid part of a kid, which it had brought in its talons, and then diſappeared. When I awoke, I laid my forehead upon the ground, and bleſſed the Prophet for the inſtruction of the morning. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewed my dream, and ſaid thus to myſelf, <hi>"Coſrou,</hi> thou haſt done well to renounce the tumult, the buſineſs, and the vanities of life; but thou haſt as yet only done it in part: thou art ſtill every day buſied in ſearch of food; thy mind is not wholly at reſt, neither is thy truſt in Providence complete. What art thou taught by this viſion? If thou haſt ſeen an eagle commiſſioned by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to feed a fox that was lame, ſhall not the hand of heaven alſo ſupply thee with food; when that which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents thee from procuring it to thyſelf is not neceſſity, but devotion?" I was now ſo confident of a miraculous ſupply, that I neglected to walk out for my repaſt, which, after the firſt day, I expected with an impatience that left me little power of attending to any other object: this impatience, however, I laboured to ſuppreſs, and perſiſted in my reſolution; but my eyes at length began to fail me, and my knees ſmote each other: I threw my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf backward, and hoped my weakneſs would ſoon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe to inſenſibility. But I was ſuddenly rouſed by the voice of an inviſible being, who pronounced theſe words: <hi>"Coſrou,</hi> I am the angel who, by the command of the Almighty, have regiſtered the thoughts of thy heart, which I am now commiſſioned to reprove. Whilſt thou waft attempting to become wiſe above that which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, thy fully has perverted the inſtructions which were vouchſafed to thee. Art thou diſabled as the fox <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Haſt thou not rather the powers of the eagle? Ariſe, let the eagle be the object of thy emulation. To pain and ſickneſs be thou again the meſſenger of eaſe and health. Virtue is not reſt, but action. If thou doſt good to man, as an evidence of thy love to God, thy virtue will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted from moral to divine; and that happineſs, which is the pledge of paradiſe, will be thy reward upon earth."</p>
               <p>"At theſe words, I was not leſs aſtoniſhed than if a mountain had been overturned at my feet. I humbled myſelf in the duſt; I returned to the city. I dug up
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:029518_0059_0FE1CCA5EBFD2778"/>
my treaſure; I was liberal, yet I became rich. My ſkill in reſtoring health to the body gave me frequent opportunities of curing the diſeaſes of the ſoul. I put on the ſacred veſtments; I grew eminent beyond my merit; and it was the pleaſure of the King that I ſhould ſtand before him. Now, therefore, be not offended; I boaſt of no knowledge that I have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. As the ſands of the deſart drink up the drops of rain, or the dew of the morning; ſo do I alſo, who am but duſt, imbibe the inſtructions of the Prophet. Believe, then, that it is he who tells thee, all knowledge is profane which terminates in thyſelf; and by a life waſted in ſpeculation, little even of this can be gained. When the gates of paradiſe are thrown open before thee, thy mind ſhall be irradiated in a moment. Here thou canſt little more than pile error upon error; there thou ſhall build truth upon truth. Wait, therefore, for the glorious viſion; and, in the mean time, emulate the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle. Much is in thy power, and therefore much is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of thee. Though the Almighty only can give virtue; yet, as a prince, thou mayſt ſtimulate thoſe to beneficence, who act from no higher motive than imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate intereſt; thou canſt not produce the principle, but mayſt enforce the practice. The relief of the poor is equal, whether they receive it from oſtentation or charity; and the effect of example is the ſame, whether it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to obtain the favour of God or man. Let thy virtue be thus diffuſed; and if thou believeſt with rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, thou ſhalt be accepted above. Farewell.—May the ſmile of <hi>him</hi> who reſides in the Heaven of heavens be upon thee! and againſt thy name, in the volume of <hi>his</hi> will, may Happineſs be written!"</p>
               <p>The King, whoſe doubts, like thoſe of <hi>Mirza,</hi> were now removed, looked up with a ſmile that communicated the joy of his mind. He diſmiſſed the prince to his gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment; and commanded thoſe events to be recorded, to the end that poſterity may know, "That no life is pleaſing to God, but that which is uſeful to mankind!"</p>

The great hurry and fatigue of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs made <hi>Minos</hi> (who then ſat as judge) to be deſirous of ſome reſpite; for which reaſon he left <hi>Common Senſe,</hi> lately arrived from the upper world, to officiate in his room.</p>
               <p>The firſt who appeared before this new ſubſtitute of <hi>Minos,</hi> was a figure that approached with an eaſy aſſurance in his countenance; he ſmiled on the court with a ſeeming complacency; and laid-claim to <hi>Elyſium,</hi> from the many generous and friendly actions of his life. No public ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription was attempted, but he was among the firſt to encourage it; no acquaintance in diſtreſs, but he contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to their relief: In ſhort, he was looked upon, while on earth, as a humane, generous man; beloved by his neighbours, and eſteemed by his acquaintances; but on further examination, it was proved, that this very perſon was mean enough to become a ſlave to a party for a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; that though ſeemingly humane to individuals, he was a betrayer and ruiner of his country's intereſt; and his ſeeming virtues proceeded not from any goodneſs of heart, but an oſtentation to keep up the empty ſhews of conſequential grandeur. On which <hi>Common Senſe</hi> with a look of ſeverity, telling him, that of all cruelty, that towards the public was the moſt unpardonable, nodded towards a black officer on the left to take him into cuſtody. This was no ſooner done, than another ghoſt was brought forward, who amazed the whole court with his unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable behaviour. When aſked to what purpoſe he had lived fifty-three years and ſome odd months; in the moſt careleſs, pick-tooth manner, with his eyes half ſhut, he replied, None: and being told that was not a ſatisfactory anſwer, he retorted with a gape—Perhaps ſo. In
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:029518_0060_0FE1CCA78DBBF5F0"/>
a word, he was found to be ſuch a one as <hi>Prior</hi> deſcribes:
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>He ſoundly ſlept the night away,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>And juſt did nothing all the day.</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This pretty gentleman being informed that indolence was not the road to <hi>Elyſium,</hi> was ordered to caſt off to the left. To him ſucceeded a firſt miniſter of ſtate: but it being proved, on his trial, that nature had deſigned him for a juggler, and that he had by miſtake been forced to animate the wrong body, he was remanded back again to earth, to ſhine in his proper ſphere. I was buried in thought for ſome time at what I ſaw, when I awakened out of my reverie, at the appearance of a ghoſt with a bloated countenance; who, on being aſked what ſort of a life he had led; anſwered, A very harmleſs one; that from the moment he had come to his eſtate, he had never known what it was to be thoroughly ſober; and that he had conſequently been a friend to his country by promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the exciſe; and as it was his fortune to be taken off in a drunken fit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he humbly hoped he might be ranked among thoſe who died in the ſervice of their country. The court was ſome time puzzled to find out a proper puniſhment for a life ſo ſcandalouſly miſpent: they knew flames would be thrown away upon him: but at length his ſtation was fixed among the ſuicides, the moſt diſmal, melancholy ſpot in hell.</p>
               <p>Quite different from the former was the next that was called upon. It was a young creature, with an unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able innocence and ſweetneſs in her countenance, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a melancholy and wanneſs, which ſeemed deeply rooted in her. When the uſual queſtion was put, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of anſwering, ſhe burſt into a flood of tears, nor was ſhe able to utter one word; but a neighbouring ghoſt, who happened to arrive about the ſame time, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed <hi>Common Senſe</hi> that ſhe had an unblemiſhed cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and was univerſally eſteemed for her good nature and ſenſe, till unfortunately ſhe had given credit to the proteſtations of a young gentleman, who had avowed in the moſt ſacred manner to make her his bride; but after gaining his ends, had baſely deſerted her, which flung her into a melancholy that ſoon put an end to her life. The whole court was moved at the relation; but <hi>Common Senſe</hi> telling her ſhe had already ſufficiently expiated for
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:029518_0061_0FE1CCB12FD49548"/>
her credulity, and that the villain who betrayed her was principally to anſwer for the crime, ordered the keeper of <hi>Elyſium</hi> to take her into his protection; which he had no ſooner done, than ſorrow fled away, her bloom return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and modeſty and lovelineſs ſhone with the moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming ſweetneſs. Upon ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eing this a whole ſhoal of coquettes flocked to their trial, not doubting to meet with the ſame good fortune; but their gambols had no other effect on <hi>Common Senſe</hi> than to haſten their filing off to the left. As for Fops, Methodiſts, Janſeniſts, Humbuggers, and others of the ſame ſpecies, as they were known enemies to <hi>Common Senſe,</hi> their trials were deferred till the return of <hi>Minos,</hi> left juſtice from him might ſeem partial. What ſeemed to me remarkable was, that <hi>Common Senſe</hi> often miſtook Methodiſts for Janſeniſts, and Janſeniſts for Methodiſts; ſo greatly ſeemed to him the reſemblance between thoſe two ſectaries.</p>
               <p>Room was now made for a lady of figure, who preſſed forward with an eaſy freedom in her air, that beſpoke her uſed to the beſt of company. The queſtion being put, ſhe declared ſhe had led a life quite gay and polite; that drums, routs, balls, intrigues, dreſs, &amp;c. had taken up her whole time; and that in the end ſhe had died a martyr to her politeneſs, by a violent cold ſhe had got at a maſquerade. On being demanded what good ſhe had done? What charities beſtowed, &amp;c. &amp;c. What good! what charities! replied ſhe; theſe are very odd ſort of queſtions: why, my dear, dear Sir, do you think we fine ladies can have time to think of ſuch things? No, no; our whole life is taken up with the more important arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of cards, ſcandal, dreſs, &amp;c. Away with her, cries <hi>Common Senſe;</hi> to the left with her; make room for her ladyſhip. Hey-day, what have we got here, continues he to a <hi>Harlequin,</hi> who entered playing his antic tricks, to the great amuſement, as he expected, of the ſpectators; but no ſooner did the keeper of <hi>Tartarus</hi> ſpy him, than (without waiting for orders) he laid his clutches on him, and poor <hi>Lunn</hi> was immediately dragged from the bar, amidſt the repeated hiſſes of the whole court. Pray, friend, ſays <hi>Common Senſe</hi> to the next, why that dejected countenance? I lived thirty ſeven years a farmer, (anſwered the ghoſt) had three ſons and one daughter, by a wife whom I tenderly loved, as I did my poor children

whoſe education I was particularly careful of, and ſhould have been the happieſt of mankind, had not the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per among the cattle, in a few weeks deprived me of my whole ſtock; my landlord threw me into priſon for a debt he knew it was impoſſible for me at that time to pay. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> this ſituation I did what I could to contribute to the maintenance of my family, by making nets, purſes, &amp;c. but it was inſufficient, and I died for want of common neceſſaries.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>This was exactly the caſe of a poor farmer, who died in a miſerable condition in YORK</hi> Caſtle.</note> Pray take care of him, cried <hi>Common Senſe</hi> to the <hi>Elyſium</hi> keeper, and convince him, that the more unfortunate virtue is in the other world, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the reward here; and though your children are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of you, they are more particularly the care of a ſuperior power and better parent, who never fails, ſooner or later, to reward goodneſs. The keeper of <hi>Elyſium</hi> ſmiling, bid him enter the happy portal; telling him he would meet with his wife there, whom it ſeems, a broken heart had kindly delivered from a troubleſome world about ſix months before.</p>
               <p>The next who mounted was a grave looking gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who no ſooner mentioned his being of the ſacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotal order, than <hi>Common Senſe</hi> cut him ſhort, by telling him it was a rule of court, when a band of caſſocks appeared, to have inquiry made through <hi>Elyſium</hi> if any were in the leaſt indebted to the reverend claimant for the happineſs they enjoyed; and if ſuch evidence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in his behalf, he was to be admitted; if not, he was obliged to take the contrary road. Upon his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion appeared two duelliſts, who had honourably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired in their vocation; no ſooner were they known than <hi>Common Senſe</hi> acquainted the black officer, that duelliſts were always his property, and deſired he would lend them his hand. On their diſappearing, a gay young fellow was introduced, hallooing and ſhouting with the moſt impudent ſtare, and ſettled aſſurance imaginable, in his countenance: hey day, ſays <hi>Common Senſe,</hi> who have we go here? Pray, good baſhful Sir, what may you be? D—e, old gentleman, returns the ſpark, do you know what a buck, what a wit is?

               <p>CARAZAN, the merchant of <hi>Bagdat,</hi> was eminent throughout all the Eaſt for his avarice and wealth; his original is obſcure as that of the ſpark, which by the colliſion of ſteel and adamant is ſtruck out of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and the patient labour of perſevering diligence alone had made him rich. It was remembered, that when he was indigent he was thought to be generous; and he was ſtill acknowledged to be inflexibly juſt. But whether in his dealings with men he diſcovered a perfidy which tempted him to put his truſt in gold; or whether in proportion as he accumulated wealth, he-diſcovered his own importance by increaſe, <hi>Carazan</hi> prized it more as he uſed it leſs: he gradually loſt the inclination to do good, as he acquired the power; and as the hand of time ſcattered ſnow upon his head, the freezing influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence extended to his boſom.</p>
               <p>But though the door of <hi>Carazan</hi> was never opened by hoſpitality, nor his hand by compaſſion, yet fear led him conſtantly to the moſque at the ſtated hours of prayer: he performed all the rites of devotion with the moſt ſcrupulous punctuality, and he had thrice paid his vows at the temple of the Prophet. That devotion which ariſes from the love of God, and neceſſarily includes the love of man, as it connects gratitude with beneficence, and exalts that which was mortal to divine, confers new dignity upon goodneſs, and is the object not only of affection but of reverence. On the contrary, the devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſelfiſh, whether it be thought to avert the puniſhment which every one wiſhes to be inſlicted, or to inſure it by the complication of hypocriſy with guilt, never fails to excite indignation and abhorrence. <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zan,</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="unknown:029518_0063_0FE1BA1468400808"/>
therefore, when he had 'locked his door, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round with a look of circumſpective ſuſpicion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the moſque, was followed by every eye with ſilent malignity; the poor ſuſpended their ſupplications when he paſſed by; though he was known by every man, yet no man ſaluted him.</p>
               <p>Such had long been the life of <hi>Carazan,</hi> and ſuch was the character which he had acquired, when notice was given by proclamation, that he was removed to a magnificent building in the center of the city; that his table ſhould be ſpread for the hungry, and that the ſtranger ſhould be welcome to his bed. The multitude ſoon ruſhed like a torrent to his door, where they beheld him diſtributing bread to the hungry, and apparel to the naked, his eye ſoftened with compaſſion, and his cheeks glowing with delight. Every one gazed with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the prodigy; and the murmur of innumerable voices increaſing like the ſound of approaching thunder. <hi>Carazan</hi> beckoned with his hand: attention ſuſpended the tumult in a moment; and be thus gratified the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity which procured him audience.</p>
               <p>To Him who touches the mountains and they ſmoke, the Almighty and the moſt merciful, be everlaſting hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our!—he hath ordained ſleep to be the miniſter of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, as his viſions have reproved me in the night. As I was ſitting alone in my Haram, with my lamp burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before me, computing the product of my merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, and exulting in the increaſe of my wealth, I fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a deep ſleep, and the hand of him who dwells in the third heaven was upon me. I beheld the angel of death coming forward like a whirlwind, and he ſmote me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I could deprecate the blow. At the ſame moment I found myſelf lifted from the ground, and tranſported with aſtoniſhing rapidity through the region of the air. The earth was contracted to an atom between; and the ſtars glowed round me with a luſtre that obſcured the ſun. The gate of paradiſe was now in ſight; and I was intercepted by a ſudden brightneſs which no human eye could behold: the irrevocable ſentence was now to be pronounced: my day of probation was paſt, and from the evil of my life nothing could be taken away, nor could any thing be added to the good. When I reflected that my lot for eternity was caſt, which not all the powers of

nature could reverſe, my con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>ence totally forſook me; and while I ſtood trembling and ſilent, covered with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and chilled with horror, I was thus addreſſed by the radiance that flamed before me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>"Carazan,</hi> thy worſhip has not been accepted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was not prompted by the love of God; neither can thy righteouſneſs be rewarded, becauſe it was not produced by the love of man: for thy own ſake only haſt thou rendered to every man his due: and thou haſt approached the almighty only for thyſelf. Thou haſt not looked up with gratitude, nor round thee with kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Around thee thou haſt indeed beheld vice and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but if vice and folly could juſtify thy parſimony, would they not condemn the bounty of heaven? If not upon the fooliſh and the vicious, where ſhall the ſun dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe his light, or the clouds diſtil their dew? Where ſhall the lips of the ſpring breathe fragrance, or the hand of autumn diffuſe plenty? Remember, <hi>Carazan</hi> that thou haſt ſhut compaſſion from thy heart, and graſped thy treaſures with an hand of iron: thou haſt lived for thyſelf; and, therefore, henceforth for ever thou ſhalt ſubſiſt alone. From the light of heaven, and from the ſociety of all beings, ſhalt thou be driven; ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itude ſhall protract the lingering hours of eternity, and darkneſs aggravate the horror of deſpair."</p>
               <p>At this moment I was driven, by ſome ſecret and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible power, through the glowing ſyſtem of creation, and paſſed innumerable worlds in a moment. As I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the verge of nature, I perceived the ſhadows of total and boundleſs vacuity deepen before me, a dreadful region of eternal ſilence, ſolitude, and darkneſs! unutterable horror ſeized me at the proſpect, and this exclamation burſt from me with all the vehemence of deſire: <hi>Oh! that I had been doomed for ever to the common receptacle of impenitence and guilt! their ſociety would have alleviated the torment of deſpair, and the rage of fire could not have excluded the comfort of light. Or, if I had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to reſide on a comet, that would return but once in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years to the regions of light and life, the hope of theſe periods, however diſtant, would cheer me in the dreary interval of cold, and darkneſs, and the viciſſitude would divide eternity into time.</hi> While this thought paſſed over my mind, I loſt ſight of the remoteſt ſtar, and the laſt glimmering of light was
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:029518_0064_0FE1CCB6F02BD150"/>
quenched in utter darkneſs. The agonies of deſpair in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed every moment, as every moment augmented my diſtance from the laſt habitable world. I reflected with intolerable anguiſh, that when ten thouſand thouſand years had carried me beyond the reach of all but that power who fills infinitude, I ſhould ſtill look forward into an immenſe abyſs of darkneſs, through which I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rther ſtill, for ever and ever. I then ſtretched out my hands towards the regions of exiſtence, with an emotion that awaked me. Thus have I been taught to eſtimate ſociety, like every other bleſſing, by its loſs. My heart is warmed to liberality; and I am zealous to communicate the happineſs which I feel, to thoſe from it is derived; for the ſociety of one wretch, whom, in the pride of proſperity, I would have ſpurned from my door, would, in the dreadful ſolitude to which I was condemned, have been more highly prized than the gold of <hi>Afric,</hi> or the gems of <hi>Golconda.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At this reflection upon his dream, <hi>Carazan</hi> became ſuddenly ſilent, and looked upwards in an ecſtacy of gratitude and devotion. The multitude was ſtruck at once with the precept and the example; and the Caliph, to whom the event was related, that he might be liberal beyond the power of gold, commanded it to be recorded for the benefit of poſterity.</p>

               <p>THOUGH there is a great deal of pleaſure in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating the material world, by which I mean that ſyſtem of bodies into which nature has ſo curiouſly wrought the maſs of dead matter, with the ſeveral rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which thoſe bodies bear to one another; there is ſtill, methinks, ſomething more wonderful and ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in contemplations on the world of life, by which I mean all thoſe animals with which every part of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe is furniſhed. The material world is only the ſhell of the univerſe: the world of life are its inhabitants.</p>
               <p>If we conſider thoſe parts of the material world which
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:029518_0065_0FE1CCB892961A38"/>
lie the neareſt to us, and are therefore ſubject to our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations and inquiries, it is amazing to conſider the infinity of animals with which it is ſtocked. Every part of matter is peopled: every green leaf ſwarms with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants. There is ſcarce a ſingle humour in the body of man, or of any other animal, in which our glaſſes do not diſcover myriads of living creatures. The ſurface of animals is alſo covered with other animals; which are in the ſame manner the baſis of other animals that live upon them: nay, we find in the moſt ſolid bodies, as in marble itſelf, innumerable cells and cavities, that are crowded with ſuch imperceptible inhabitants, as are too little for the naked eye to diſcover. On the other hand, if we look into the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ore bulky parts of nature, we ſee the ſeas, lakes, and rivers, teeming with numberleſs kinds of living creatures, we find every mountain and marſh, wilderneſs and wood, plentifully ſtocked with birds and beaſts, and every part of matter affording proper neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and conveniencies for the livelihood of multitudes which inhabit it.</p>
               <p>The author of the <hi>Plurality of Worlds</hi> draws a very good argument from this conſideration for the <hi>peopling</hi> of every planet; as indeed it ſeems very probable, from the anal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogy of reaſon, that if no part of matter which we are acquainted with lies waſte and uſeleſs, thoſe great bodies, which are at ſuch a diſtance from us, ſhould not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart and unpeopled, but rather that they ſhould be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with beings adapted to their reſpective ſituations.</p>
               <p>Exiſtence is a bleſſing to thoſe beings only which are endowed with perception, and is in a manner thrown away upon dead matter, any farther than as it is ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to beings which are conſcious of their exiſtence. Accordingly we find, from the bodies which lie under our obſervation, that matter is only made as the baſis and ſupport of animals; and that there is no more of the one than what is neceſſary to the exiſtence of the other.</p>
               <p>Infinite goodneſs is of ſo communicative a nature, that it ſeems to delight in the conferring of exiſtence upon every degree of perceptive being. As this is a ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which I have often purſued with great pleaſure to myſelf, I ſhall enlarge farther upon it, by conſidering that part of the ſcale of being which comes within our knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="unknown:029518_0065_0FE1CCB892961A38"/>
There are ſome living creatures which are raiſed but juſt above dead matter. To mention only that ſpecies of ſhell fiſh which is formed in the faſhion of a cone, that grow to the ſurface of ſeveral rocks, and immediately die upon their being ſevered from the place where they grow. There are many other creatures but one remove from theſe, which have no other ſenſe beſides that of feeling and taſte. Others have ſtill an additional one of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: others of ſmall, and others of ſight. It is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to obſerve, by what a gradual progreſs the world of life advances through a prodigious variety of ſpecies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a creature is formed that is complete in all its ſenſes; and even among theſe there is ſuch a different degree of perfection in the ſenſe which one animal enjoys, beyond what appears in another, that though the ſenſe in differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent animals be diſtinguiſhed by the ſame common denom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inations, it ſeems almoſt of a different nature. If, after this, we look into the ſeveral inward perfections of cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ſagacity, or what we generally call inſtinct, we find them riſing after the ſame manner imperceptibly one above another, and receiving additional improvements according to the ſpecies in which they are implanted. This progreſs in nature is ſo very gradual, that the moſt perfect of an inferior ſpecies comes very near to the moſt imperfect of that which is immediately above it.</p>
               <p>The exuberant and overflowing goodneſs of the ſupreme Being, whoſe mercy extends to all his works, is plainly ſeen, as I have before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>inted, from his having made ſo very little matter, at leaſt what falls within our knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge, that does not ſwarm with life: no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> is his goodneſs leſs ſeen in the diverſity, than in the multitude of living creatures. Had he only made one ſpecies of animals, none of the reſt would have enjoyed the happineſs of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence; he has, therefore, <hi>ſpecified</hi> in his creation every degree of life, every capacity of beings. The whole chaſm of nature, from a plant to a man, is filled up with diverſe kinds of creatures, riſing one over another, by ſuch a gentle and eaſy aſcent, that the little tranſitions and deviations from one ſpecies to another are almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible. This intermediate ſpace is ſo well huſbanded and managed, that there is ſcarce a degree of perception which does not appear in ſome one part of the world of life. Is the goodneſs or wiſdom of the divine Being more manifeſted in this his proceeding?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="unknown:029518_0066_0FE1CCC423BA6C60"/>
There is a conſequence, beſides thoſe I have already mentioned, which ſeems very naturally deducible from the foregoing conſiderations. If the ſcale of being riſes by ſuch a regular progreſs ſo high as a man, we may, by a parity of reaſon, ſuppoſe that it ſtill proceeds gradually through thoſe beings which are of a ſuperior nature to him; ſince there is an infinitely greater ſpace and room for different degrees of perfection between the ſupreme Being and man, than between man and the moſt deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inſect. This conſequence of ſo great a variety of beings which are ſuperior to us, from that variety which is inferior to us, is made by Mr. <hi>Locke,</hi> in a paſſage which I ſhall here ſet down, after having premiſed, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding there is ſuch infinite room between man and his Maker for the creative power to exert itſelf in, it is impoſſible that it ſhould ever be filled up, ſince there will be ſtill an infinite gap or diſtance between the higheſt created being, and the great power which produced them.</p>
               <p>"That there ſhould be more <hi>ſpecies</hi> of intelligent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures above us than there are of ſenſible and material below us, is probable to me from hence, that in all the viſible corporeal world, we ſee no chaſms or gaps. All quite down from us, the deſcent is by eaſy ſteps, and a continued ſeries of things, that each remove differs very little one from the other. There are fiſhes that have wings, and are no ſtrangers to the airy region: and there are ſome birds, that are inhabitants of the water, whoſe blood is cold as fiſhes, and their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ſh ſo like in taſte, that the ſcrupulous are allowed them on fiſh days. There are animals ſo near akin both to birds and beaſts, that they are in the middle between both: amphibious ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals link the terreſtrial and aquatic together: ſeals live on land and at ſea, and porpoiſes have the warm blood and entrails of a hog; not to mention what is confidently reported of mermaids, or ſea-men. There are ſome brutes that ſeem to have as much knowledge and reaſon as ſome that are called men; and the animal and vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table kingdoms are ſo nearly joined, that if you will take the loweſt of the one, and the higheſt of the other, there will ſcarce be perceived any great difference between them: and ſo on, until we come to the loweſt and the moſt inorganical parts of matter, we ſhall find every where that the ſeveral ſpecies are linked together, and
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:029518_0066_0FE1CCC423BA6C60"/>
differ but in almoſt inſenſible degrees. And when we conſider the infinite power and wiſdom of the Maker, we have reaſon to think, that it is ſuitable to the magnif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icent harmony of the univerſe, and the great deſign and infinite goodneſs of the Architect, that the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſhould alſo, by gentle degrees, aſcend upwards from us towards his infinite perfection, as we ſee they gradually deſcend from us downwards: which, if it be probable, we have reaſon then to be perſuaded, that there are far more ſpecies of creatures above us than there are beneath; we being in a degree of perfection much more remote from the infinite being of God than we are from the loweſt ſtate of being, and that which approaches neareſt to nothing; and yet of all thoſe diſtinct <hi>ſpecies</hi> we have no clear diſtinct ideas."</p>
               <p>In this ſyſtem of being there is no creature ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in its nature, and which ſo much deſerves our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular attention as man, who fills up the middle ſpace between the animal and the intellectual nature, the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and inviſible world, and is that link in the chain of beings which has been often termed the <hi>Nexus utriuſque Mundi.</hi> So that he who in one reſpect is aſſociated with angels and archangels, may look upon a being of infin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite perfection as his father, and the higheſt order of ſpirits as his brethren; may, in another reſpect, ſay to <hi>corruption, Thou art my father; and to the worm, Thou art my mother and ſiſter.</hi>

               <p>THOSE who were ſkilled in anatomy among the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients concluded, from the outward and inward make of a human body, that it was the work of a being tranſcendently wiſe and powerful. As the world grew more enlightened in this art, their diſcoveries gave them freſh opportunities of admiring the conduct of providence in the formation of a human body. <hi>Galen</hi> was converted by his diſſections; and could not but own a ſupreme
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:029518_0067_0FE1CCC6E92C34F8"/>
Being upon a ſurvey of this his handy-work. There were, indeed, many parts of which the old anatomiſts did not know the certain uſe; but as they ſaw that moſt of thoſe which they examined were adapted with admirable art to their ſeveral functions, they did not queſtion but thoſe whoſe uſes they could not determine were contrived with the ſame wiſdom for reſpective ends and purpoſes. Since the circulation of the blood has been found out, and many other great diſcoveries have been made by our modern anatomiſts, we ſee new wonders in the human frame, and diſcern ſeveral important uſes for thoſe parts which the ancients knew nothing of. In ſhort, the body of man is ſuch a ſubject as ſtands the utmoſt teſt of exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ination. Though it appears formed with the niceſt wiſdom, upon the moſt ſuperficial ſurvey of it, it ſtill mends upon the ſearch, and produces our ſurpriſe and amazement in proportion as we pry into it. What I have here ſaid of a human body may be applied to the body of every animal which has been the ſubject of an anatomical obſervation.</p>
               <p>The body of an animal is an object adequate to our ſenſes. It is a particular ſyſtem of providence, that lies in a narrow compaſs. The eye is able to command it, and by ſucceſſive inquiries can ſearch into all its parts. Could the body of the whole earth, or indeed the whole univerſe, be thus ſubmitted to the examination of our ſenſes, were it not too big and diſproportioned for our inquiries, too unwieldy for the management of the eye and hand, there is no queſtion but it would appear to us as curious and well-contrived a frame as that of a human body. We could ſee the ſame concatenation and ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vience, the ſame neceſſity and uſefulneſs, the ſame beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and harmony in all and every of its parts, as what we diſcover in the body of every ſingle animal.</p>
               <p>The more extended our reaſon is, and the more able to grapple the immenſe objects, the greater ſtill are thoſe diſcoveries which it makes of wiſdom and providence in the works of the creation. A Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton,</hi> who ſtands up as the miracle of the preſent age, can look through a whole planetary ſyſtem; conſider it in its weight, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and meaſure; and draw from it as many demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of infinite power and wiſdom, as a more confined underſtanding is able to deduce from the ſyſtem of a human body.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="unknown:029518_0067_0FE1CCC6E92C34F8"/>
But to return to our ſpeculations on anatomy. I ſhall here conſider the frabic and texture of the bodies of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals in one particular view; which, in my opinion, ſhews the hand of a thinking and all-wiſe Being in their forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with the evidence of a thouſand demonſtrations. I think we may lay this down as an inconteſtible principle, that chance never acts in a perpetual uniformity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency with itſelf. If one ſhould always fling the ſame number with ten thouſand dice, or ſee every throw juſt five times leſs, or five times more in number than the throw which immediately preceded it, who would not imagine there is ſome inviſible power which directs the caſt? This is the proceeding which we find in the oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of nature. Every kind of animal is diverſified by different magnitudes, each of which gives riſe to a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſpecies. Let a man trace the dog or lion kind, and he will obſerve how many of the works of nature are publiſhed, if I may uſe the expreſſion, in a variety of editions. If we look into the reptile world, or into thoſe different kinds of animals that fill the element of water, we meet with the ſame repetitions among ſeveral ſpecies, that differ very little from one another but in ſize and bulk. You find the ſame creature that is drawn at large, copied out in ſeveral proportions, and ending in minia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It would be tedious to produce inſtances of this regular conduct in Providence, as it would be ſuperfluous to thoſe who are verſed in the natural hiſtory of animals. The magnificent harmony of the univerſe is ſuch, that we may obſerve innumerable <hi>diviſions</hi> running upon the ſame ground. I might alſo extend this ſpeculation to the dead parts of nature, in which we may find matter diſpoſed into many <hi>ſimilar</hi> ſyſtems, as well in our ſurvey of ſtars and planets, as of ſtones, vegetables, and other ſublunary parts of the creation. In a word, Providence has ſhewn the richneſs of its goodneſs and wiſdom, not only in the production of many original ſpecies, but in the multiplicity of deſcents which it has made on every original ſpecies in particular.</p>
               <p>But to purſue this thought ſtill farther: every living creature conſidered in itſelf has many very complicated parts that are exact copies of ſome other parts which it poſſeſſes, and which are complicated in the ſame manner. One eye would have been ſufficient for the ſubſiſtence
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:029518_0068_0FE1CCC88C0E5590"/>
and preſervation of an animal; but, in order to better his condition, we ſee another placed with a mathematical exactneſs in the ſame moſt advantageous ſituation, and in every particular of the ſame ſize and texture. Is it poſſible for chance to be ſo uniform in her operations? Should a million of dice turn up twice together the ſame number, the wonder would be nothing in compariſon of this. But when we ſee this ſimilitude and reſemblance in the arm, the hand, the fingers; when we ſee one half of the body entirely correſpond with the other in all thoſe minute ſtrokes, without which a man might very well have ſubſiſted: nay, when we often ſee a ſingle part repeated an hundred times in the ſame body, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it conſiſts in the moſt intricate weaving of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs fibres, and thoſe parts differing ſtill in magnitude, as the convenience of their particular ſituation requires; ſurely man muſt have a ſtrange caſt of underſtanding, who does not diſcover the finger of God in ſo wonderful a work. Theſe duplicates in thoſe parts of the body, without which a man might have very well ſubſiſted, though not ſo well as with them, are a plain demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an all-wiſe Contriver; as thoſe more numerous copyings, which are found among the veſſels of the ſame body, are evident demonſtrations that they could not be the work of chance. This argument receives additional ſtrength, if we apply it to every animal and inſect within our knowledge, as well as to thoſe numberleſs living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that are objects too minute for the human eye: and if we conſider how the ſeveral ſpecies in this whole world of life reſemble one another in very many particulars, ſo far as is convenient for their reſpective ſtates of exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, it is much more probable, that an hundred million of dice ſhould be caſually thrown a hundred million of times in the ſame number, than that the body of any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle animal ſhould be produced by the fortuitous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of matter. And that the like chance ſhould ariſe in innumerable inſtances, requires a degree of credulity that is not under the direction of common ſenſe. We may carry this conſideration yet farther, if we reflect on the two ſexes in every living ſpecies, with their reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances to each other, and thoſe particular diſtinctions that were neceſſary for the keeping up of this great world of life.</p>

               <p>I WAS yeſterday about ſun-ſet walking in the open fields, till the night inſenſibly fell upon me. I at firſt amuſed myſelf with all the richneſs and variety of colours which appeared in the weſtern parts of heaven: in proportion as they faded away and went out, ſeveral ſtars and planets appeared, one after another, until the whole firmament was in a glow. The blueneſs of the aether was exceedingly heightened and enlivened by the ſeaſon of the year, and by the rays of all thoſe luminaries that paſſed through it. The <hi>Galaxy</hi> appeared in its moſt beautiful white. To complete the ſcene, the full moon roſe at length in that clouded majeſty which <hi>Milton</hi> takes notice of, and opened to the eye a new picture of nature, which was more finely ſhaded, and diſpoſed among ſofter lights, than that which the ſun had before diſcovered to us.</p>
               <p>As I was ſurveying the moon walking in her bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and taking her progreſs among the conſtellations, a thought aroſe in me, which I believe very often perplexes and diſturbs man of a ſerious and contemplative nature. <hi>David</hi> himſelf fell into it in that reflection, "When I conſider the heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the ſtars, which thou haſt ordained; what is man, that thou art mindful of him! and the ſon of man, that thou regardeſt him!" In the ſame manner, when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the infinite hoſt of ſtars, or, to ſpeak more philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phically, of ſuns, which were then ſhining upon me, with thoſe innumerable ſets of planets or worlds which were moving round their reſpective ſuns; when I ſtill enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:029518_0069_0FE1CCCA29B67780"/>
the idea, and ſuppoſed another heaven of ſuns, and worlds riſing ſtill above this which we diſcovered, and theſe ſtill enlightened by a ſuperior firmament of lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, which are planted at ſo great a diſtance, that they may appear to the inhabitants of the former as the ſtars do to us: in ſhort, while I purſued this thought, I could not but reflect on that little inſignificant figure which I myſelf bore amidſt the immenſity of God's works.</p>
               <p>Were the ſun, which enlightens this part of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with all the hoſts of planetary worlds that move about him, utterly extinguiſhed and annihilated, they would not be miſſed more than a grain of ſand on the ſea ſhore. The ſpace they poſſeſs is ſo exceeding little in compariſon of the whole, that it would ſcarce make a <hi>blank</hi> in the creation.—The chaſm would be impercept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible to an eye that could take in the whole compaſs of nature, and paſs from one end of creation to the other, as it is poſſible there may be ſuch a ſenſe in ourſelves hereafter, or in creatures which are at preſent more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted than ourſelves. We ſee many ſtars by the help of glaſſes, which we do not diſcover with our naked eye; and the finer our teleſcopes are, the more ſtill are our diſcoveries. <hi>Huygenius</hi> carries this thought ſo far, that he does not think it impoſſible but there may be ſtars whoſe light has not yet travelled down to us ſince their firſt creation. There is no queſtion but the univerſe has certain bounds ſet to it; but when we conſider that it is the work of infinite power, prompted by infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with an infinite ſpace to exert itſelf in, how can our imagination ſet any bounds to it?</p>
               <p>To return therefore to my firſt thought, I could not but look upon myſelf with ſecret horror, as a being that was not worthy the ſmalleſt regard of one who had ſo great a work under his care and ſuperintendency. I was afraid of being overlooked amidſt the immenſity of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and loſt among that infinite variety of creatures which in all probability ſwarm through all thoſe immea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable regions of matter.</p>
               <p>In order to recover myſelf from this mortifying thought, I conſidered that it took its riſe from thoſe narrow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions which we are apt to entertain of the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. We ourſelves cannot attend to many different objects at the ſame time. If we are careful to inſpect
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:029518_0069_0FE1CCCA29B67780"/>
ſome things, we muſt of courſe neglect others. This im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection which we obſerve in ourſelves, is an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which cleaves in ſome degree to creatures of the higheſt capacities, as they are creatures, that is, beings of finite and limited natures. The preſence of every cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated being is confined to a certain meaſure of ſpace, and conſequently his obſervation is ſtinted to a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of objects. The ſphere in which we move, and act, and underſtand, is of a wider circumference to one crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture than another, according as we riſe one above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſcale of exiſtence. But the wideſt of theſe our ſpheres has its circumference. When therefore we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on the divine nature, we are ſo uſed and accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this imperfection in ourſelves, that we cannot for-hear in ſome meaſure aſcribing it to Him in whom there is no ſhadow of imperfection. Our reaſon, indeed, aſſures us, that his attributes are infinite; but the poorneſs of our conceptions is ſuch, that it cannot forbear ſetting bounds to every thing it contemplates, until our reaſon comes again to our ſuccour, and throws down all thoſe little prejudices which riſe in us unawares, and are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to the mind of man.</p>
               <p>We ſhould therefore utterly extinguiſh this melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thought, of our being overlooked by our Maker in the multiplicity of his works, and the infinity of theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects among which he ſeems to be inceſſantly employed; if we conſider, in the firſt place, that he is omnipreſent; and that, in the ſecond place, he is omniſcient.</p>
               <p>If we conſider him in his omnipreſence, his being paſſes through, actuates, and ſupports the whole frame of nature; his creation, and every part of it, is full of him. There is nothing he has made that is either ſo diſtant, ſo little, or ſo inconſiderable, which he does not eſſentially inhabit. His ſubſtance is within the ſubſtance of every being, whether material or immaterial, and as intimately preſent to it as that being is to itſelf. It would be an imperfection in him, were he able to remove out of one place into another, or to withdraw himſelf from any thing he has created, or from any part of that ſpace which is diffuſed and ſpread abroad to infinity. In ſhort, to ſpeak of him in the language of the old philoſopher, he is a Being whoſe center is every where, and his circumference no where.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="unknown:029518_0070_0FE1CCD60CA0D190"/>
In the ſecond place, he is omniſcient as well as omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent. His omniſcience indeed, neceſſarily and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally flows from his omnipreſence; he cannot but be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of every motion that ariſes in the whole material world, which he thus eſſentially pervades, and of every thought that is ſtirring in the intellectual world, to every part of which he is intimately united. Several moraliſts have conſidered the creation as the temple of God, which he has built with his own hand, and which is filled with his preſence. Others have conſidered infinite ſpace as the receptacle, or rather the habitation of the Almighty: but the nobleſt and moſt exalted way of conſidering this infinite ſpace, is that of Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton,</hi> who calls it the <hi>Senſorium</hi> of the Godhead. Brutes and men have their <hi>ſenſoriola,</hi> or little <hi>ſenſoriums,</hi> by which they apprehend the preſence, and perceive the actions of a few objects that lie contiguous to them. Their knowledge and obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion turn within a very narrow circle. But as God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty cannot but perceive and know every thing in which he reſides, infinite ſpace gives room to infinite knowledge, and is, as it were, an organ to omniſcience.</p>
               <p>Were the ſoul ſeparated from the body, and with one glance of thought could ſtart beyond the bounds of the creation; ſhould it for millions of years continue its progreſs through infinite ſpace with the ſame activity, it would ſtill find itſelf within the embrace of its Creator, and encompaſſed round with the immenſity of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. Whilſt we are in the body, he is not leſs preſent with us, becauſe he is concealed from us. "O that I knew where I might find him! (ſays Job) Behold I go forward, but he is not there! and backward, but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perceive him. On the left hand, where he does work, but I cannot behold him. He hides himſelf on the right hand that I cannot ſee him." In ſhort, reaſon, as well as revelation aſſure us, that he cannot be abſent from us, notwithſtanding he is undiſcovered by us.</p>
               <p>In this conſideration of God Almighty's omnipreſence and omniſcience, every uncomfortable thought vaniſhes. He cannot but regard every thing that has being, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſuch of his creatures who fear they are not regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him. He is privy to all their thoughts, and to that anxiety of heart in particular, which is apt to trouble them on this occaſion: for, as it is impoſſible he ſhould
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:029518_0070_0FE1CCD60CA0D190"/>
overlook any of his creatures, ſo we may be confident that he regards, with an eye of mercy, thoſe who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to recommend themſelves to his notice, and in an unfeigned humility of heart think themſelves unworthy that he ſhould be mindful of them.</p>

               <p>I WAS yeſterday walking alone in one of my friend's woods, and loſt myſelf in it very agreeably; as I was running over in my mind the ſeveral arguments that eſtabliſh the great point which is the baſis of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, and the ſource of all the pleaſing hopes and ſecret joys that can ariſe in the heart of a reaſonable creature, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the immortality of the ſoul. I conſidered theſe ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral proofs, drawn,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> From the nature of the ſoul itſelf, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly its immateriality; which, though not abſolutely neceſſary to the eternity of its duration, has, I think, been evinced to almoſt a demonſtration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> From its paſſions and ſentiments, as particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly from its love of exiſtence, its horror of annihilation, and its hopes of immortality; with that ſecret ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which it finds in the practice of virtue, and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs which follows in it upon the commiſſion of vice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> From the nature of the Supreme Being, whoſe juſtice, goodneſs, wiſdom, and veracity, are all concerned in this great point.</p>
               <p>But amongſt theſe and other excellent arguments for the immortality of the ſoul, there is one drawn from the perpetual progreſs of the ſoul to its perfection, without a poſſibility of ever arriving at it; which is a hint that I do not remember to have ſeen opened and improved by others who have written on this ſubject, though it ſeems to me to carry a great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>blown, and capable of no farther enlargement, I would imagine it might fall away inſenſibly, and drop at once into a ſtate of annihil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. But can we believe a thinking being, that is in a perpetual progreſs of improvement, and travelling on from perfection to perfection, after having juſt looked abroad into the works of its Creator, and made a few diſcoveries of his infinite goodneſs, wiſdom, and power, muſt periſh at its firſt ſetting out, and in the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of its inquiries?</p>
               <p>A man, conſidered in his preſent ſtate, ſeems only ſent into the world to propagate his kind. He provides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a ſucceſſor, and immediately quits his poſt to make room for him. He does not ſeem born to enjoy life, but to deliver it down to others. This is not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing to conſider in animals which are formed for our uſe, and can finiſh their buſineſs in a ſhort life. The ſilk-worm after having ſpun her taſk, lays her eggs, and dies. But a man can never have taken his full meaſure of knowledge; has not time to ſubdue his paſſions, eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh his ſoul in virtue, and come up to the perfection of his nature, before he is hurried off the ſtage. Would an infinitely wiſe being make ſuch glorious creatures for ſo mean a purpoſe? Can be delight in the production of ſuch abortive intelligencies, ſuch ſhort-lived reaſonable beings? Would he give us talents that are not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted? Capacities that are not to be gratified? How can we find that wiſdom, which ſhines through all his works, in the formation of man, without looking on this world as only a nurſery for the next, and believing that the ſeveral generations of rational creatures, which riſe up and diſappear in ſuch quick ſucceſſions, are only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their firſt rudiments of exiſtence here, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to be tranſplanted into a more friendly climate, where they may ſpread and flouriſh to all eternity?</p>
               <p>There is not, in my opinion, a more pleaſing and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant conſideration in religion, than this of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual progreſs which the ſoul makes towards the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of its nature, without ever arriving at a period in
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:029518_0071_0FE1CCD82EFC6D58"/>
it. To look upon the ſoul as going on from ſtrength to ſtrength; to conſider that it is to ſhine for ever with new acceſſions of glory, and brighten to all eternity; that it will ſtill be adding virtue to virtue, and knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge to knowledge; carries in it ſomething wonderfully agreeable to that ambition which is natural to the mind of man. Nay, it muſt be a proſpect pleaſing to God himſelf, to ſee his creation for ever beautifying in his eyes, and drawing nearer to him by greater degrees of reſemblance.</p>
               <p>Methinks this ſingle conſideration of the progreſs of a finite ſpirit to perfection, will be ſufficient to extinguiſh all envy in inferior nature, and all contempt in ſuperior. That cherubim which now appears as a God to a human ſoul, knows very well that the period will come about in eternity, when the human ſoul will be as perfect as he himſelf now is; nay, when it ſhall look down upon that degree of perfection as much as it now falls ſhort of it. It is true, the higher nature ſtill advances, he by that means preſerves the diſtance and ſuperiority in the ſcale of beings; but he knows, how high ſoever the ſtation is of which he ſtands poſſeſſed at preſent, the inferior nature will at length mount up to it, and ſhine forth in the ſame degree of glory.</p>
               <p>With what aſtoniſhment and veneration may we look into our own ſouls, where there are ſuch hidden ſtores of virtue and knowledge, ſuch inexhauſted ſources of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection! we know not yet what we ſhall be; nor will it ever enter into the heart of man to conceive the glory that will be always in reſerve for him. The ſoul, conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered with its Creator, is like one of thoſe mathematical lines that may draw nearer to one another to all eternity, without a poſſibility of touching it: and can there be a thought ſo tranſporting, as to conſider ourſelves in theſe perpetual approaches to him, who is not only the ſtandard of perfection, but of happineſs?</p>

               <p>IN a late converſation among ſome of the great and the wiſe, <hi>Theron,</hi> a man of wealth and figure, but unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the philoſophic ſcience, ſat in the midſt of his friends of both ſexes in a ſtately room, with rich variety of furniture. <hi>Theron</hi> complained, that he had often heard it ſaid <hi>how much we were all indebted to the country and the plough:</hi> but, for his part, he knew no obligation that we had to that low rank of mankind, whoſe life is taken up in the fields, the woods, and the meadows; but that they paid their rents well, that the gentlemen might live at their eaſe. <hi>Crito</hi> was pleaſed to ſeize the occaſion, and entertained the gay audience with a ſurpriſing lecture of philoſophy.</p>
               <p>"Permit me, <hi>Theron,</hi> ſaid he, to be an advocate for the peaſant, and I can draw up a long account of particulars for which you are indebted to the field and the foreſt, and to the men that cultivate the ground, and are engaged in rural buſineſs. Look around you on all the furniture of the room, ſurvey your own clothing, caſt your eyes on all the ſplendid array of <hi>Therina</hi> and <hi>Perſis,</hi> and the other ladies near them, and you will find, that, except a few glittering ſtones, and a little gold and ſilver which were dug out of the bowels of the earth, you can ſcarce ſee any thing that was not once growing green upon the ground, through the various labours of the planter and the ploughman. Whence came the floor you tread on, part where of is inlaid with wood of different colours? Whence theſe fair pannels of wainſcot, and the cornice that encompaſſes and adorns the room? Whence this lofty room of cedar, and the carved ornaments of it? Are they not all the ſpoils of the trees of the foreſt? Were not theſe once the verdant ſtandard of the grove or mountain? What are your hangings of gay tapeſtry? Are they not owing to the fleece of the ſheep, which borrowed their nouriſhment from the graſs of the mead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ows? Thus the finery of your parlour once was graſs: and ſhould you favour me with a turn into your bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, I could ſhew that the curtains, and the linen, and
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:029518_0072_0FE1CCD9D1338C98"/>
coſtly coverings, where you take your nightly repoſe, were ſome years ago all growing in the fields.</p>
               <p>But I need not retire from the place where we are ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to give you abundant diſcoveries of this truth: is not the hair of camels a part of the materials which compoſe thoſe rich curtains which hang down by the windows, and the eaſy chairs which accommodate your friends? And if you think a little, you will find that camels, with their hair, were made of graſs, as well as the ſheep with their wool. What are the books that lie in the window, and the little implements of paper and wax, pens, and wafers, which I preſume may be found in the eſcrutore? They have all the ſame original; they were once more vegetables. Paper and books owe their being to the tatters of linen which were woven of the threads of flax, or hemp. The paſteboard covers are compoſed of paper, and the leather is the ſkin of the calf, that drew its life and ſuſtenance from the meadows. The pen that you write with was plucked from the wing of the gooſe, which lived upon the graſs of the common: the inkhorn was borrowed from the front of the grazing ox: the wafer is made of the paſte of bread-corn; and the wax is originally plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered from the bee, who ſtole it out of a thouſand flowers.</p>
               <p>Permit me, ladies, ſaid the philoſopher, to mention your dreſs; too nice a ſubject indeed for a ſcholar to pretend any ſkill in: but I perſuade myſelf your candour will not reſent my naming the rich materials, ſince I leave thoſe more important points, the faſhion and the air, to be decided entirely by your ſuperior ſkill. Shall I inquire, then, who gave <hi>Perſis</hi> the ſilken habit which ſhe wears? Did ſhe not borrow it from the worm that ſpun thoſe ſhining threads? And whence did the worm borrow it? From the leaves of the Mulberry-tree, which was planted and nouriſhed for this purpoſe by the country ſwain. May I aſk again, How came <hi>Therina</hi> by the fine linen which ſhe is pleaſed to appear in, and the coſtly lace of <hi>Flanders</hi> that ſurrounds it? Was it not made of the ſtalks of flax that grew up in the field like other vegetables? And are not the fineſt of your muſlins owing to the <hi>Indian</hi> cotton-tree? Nor can you tell me, <hi>Theron,</hi> one upper garment you have, whether co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, cloak, or night gown, from your ſhoulders to your very feet, as rich and as new as you think it, which the ſheep, or the poor ſilk-worm has not
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:029518_0073_0FE1CCDB6CDBEEB8"/>
worn before you. It is certain the beaver bore your hat upon his ſkin; that ſoft fur was his covering before it was yours: and the materials of your very ſhoes, both the upper part and the ſoles of them, cover the calf of the heifer before they were put on your feet: all this was graſs at firſt; for we have ſeen that all the animal world owes its being to vegetables.</p>
               <p>Give me leave, Madam, ſaid he to <hi>Therina,</hi> without offence, to lead you into further wonder. You have ſeen that the furniture of the place where we are, as well as precious attire in which you are dreſſed, were lately the production, and the ornament of the foreſt, the meadow, or the garden. But could you forgive me, if I ſhould attempt to perſuade you, that this beautiful body of yours, thoſe lovely limbs, were once growing alſo in the fields and meadows? I ſee, Ladies, you are a little ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſurpriſed at the thought. I confeſs the idea and ſentiments of philoſophy are not always ſo courtly and ſo favourable to huma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> nature, as to be addreſſed to the tender ſex: but pardon me, <hi>Therina,</hi> if I inquire, Was not your infancy nurſed with milk and bread-corn? Have you not been fed with wheat, though it was of the fineſt kind? And your drink, what has it been, but either the infuſion of barley, or the juice of the grape? Or, for variety, perhaps the cyder grove has ſupplied you. The fleſh with which you have been nouriſhed to ſuch a well proportioned ſtature, belonged to four footed animals, or to the fowls of the air; and each of theſe have been either fed with corn or graſs. Whence then, Madam, has your body been ſupported, and what do you think it is made of?</p>
               <p>But it is ſafer to transfer the argument to myſelf. Theſe limbs of mine, <hi>Therina,</hi> owe themſelves entirely to the animal and vegetable food, to the roots, or the ſtalks, or the leaves, or the fruit of plants, or the fleſh of the brute creatures, which have paſſed through my mouth for theſe fifty years, or the mouth of my parents before me. This hand would have been worn to a mere ſkele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, my arms had been dry bones, and my trunk and ribs the ſtatue of death, had they not all received per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual recruits from the field. Theſe lips which now addreſs you, are of the ſame materials, and they were once growing like the graſs on the earth. This very
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:029518_0073_0FE1CCDB6CDBEEB8"/>
fleſh, which I call mine now, did belong to the ſheep or the ox before it was part of me; and it ſerved to clothe thoſe bones before it covered mine. You know, <hi>Theron,</hi> you are a gentleman who delight in rural ſports, when you reſide at your country ſeat, and you love to feaſt on the game that you have purſued. Did you ever ſuppoſe that any part of yourſelf was once hurried through the air in the breaſt of a frightened partridge, which came before night into your net? Or that any piece of you was driven through the fields before the full-mouthed hounds on the legs of a hunted hare, which was the next day prepared for your table? Had you ever ſo ſtrange a thought as this? And can you believe it now? Or, upon a ſurvey of that argument, can you tell how to deny it? And what are hares and partridges made of, but growing herbage, or ſhattered corn?</p>
               <p>It is true, you have ſometimes taſted fiſh, either from the ſea or rivers, but even thoſe in their original are alſo ſorts of graſs; they have been fed partly by ſea-weeds, and partly by leſſer fiſh, which they have devoured, whoſe prime and natural nouriſhment was from ſome vegetable matter in the watery world. In ſhort, Sir, I am free to declare, that whether I have eaten cheeſe or butter, bread or milk, whether I have fed on the ox or the ſheep, or the fowls of the air, I am certain that this body, and theſe limbs of mine, even to my teeth and nails, and the hairs of my head, are all borrowed origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally from the vegetable creation. Every thing of me that is not a <hi>thinking power,</hi> that is not <hi>mind,</hi> or <hi>ſpirit,</hi> was once growing like graſs on the ground, or was made of the roots which ſupported ſome green herbage.</p>
               <p>And now, <hi>Theron,</hi> What do you think of all theſe para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes? Which of them do you cavil at? Which leaves you room for doubt or queſtion? Is not philoſophy an entertaining ſtudy, that teaches us our original, and the aſtoniſhing operations of divine Wiſdom and Providence? But it teaches us alſo to have humble thoughts of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to remember from whence we came. <hi>Theron,</hi> to conclude the diſcourſe, confeſſed his ſurprize and conviction; he acknowledged the juſtice of <hi>Crito'</hi>s whole argument, gave him hearty thanks for his inſtructive lecture, and reſolved to remember thoſe amazing ſcenes of the operations of nature, and the adorable wiſdom of
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:029518_0074_0FE1CCE8CC2AF998"/>
God his Maker. Nor ſhall I ever forget, ſaid he, the ſtrange and unexpected dependence of man on all the meaner parts of the creation. I am convinced, that <hi>pride was never made for man,</hi> when I ſee how much a-kin his body is to the fowls of the air and brutes of the earth. And I think, ſaid he, I am more indebted to my tenants than ever I could have imagined; nor will I caſt ſuch a ſcornful eye again on the grazier and the farmer, ſince this fleſh and blood of mine, as well as the furniture of my houſe, and the clothes I wear, were once growing in the fields or woods, under their care and cultivation; and I find I am nearer a-kin to them, ſince this ſelf of mine, with all the finery that covers it, was made origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of the ſame materials with them and their coarſer coverings.</p>

               <p>ALEWD young fellow ſeeing an aged Hermit go by him barefooted, <hi>Father,</hi> ſays he, <hi>you are in a very miſerable condition, if there is not another world. True, ſon,</hi> ſaid the Hermit, <hi>but what is thy condition if there is?</hi> Man is a creature deſigned for two different ſtates of being, or rather for two different lives. His firſt life is ſhort and tranſient; his ſecond permanent and laſting. The queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we are all concerned in is this. In which of theſe two lives is it our chief intereſt to make ourſelves happy? Or, in other words, whether we ſhould endeavour to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to ourſelves the pleaſures and gratifications of a life which is uncertain and precarious, and at its ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt length of a very inconſiderable duration; or ſecure to ourſelves the pleaſures of a life which is fixed and ſettled, and will never end? Every man, upon the firſt hearing of this queſtion, knows very well which ſide of it he ought to cloſe with. But, however right we are in theory, it is plain that in practice we adhere to the wrong ſide of the queſtion. We make proviſion for this life, as
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:029518_0074_0FE1CCE8CC2AF998"/>
though it were never to have an end; and for the other life, as though it were never to have a beginning.</p>
               <p>Should a ſpirit of ſuperior rank, who is a ſtranger to human nature, accidentally alight upon the earth, and take a new ſurvey of its inhabitants; what would his notions of us be? Would not he think that we are a ſpecies of beings made for quite different ends and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes than what we really are; muſt not he imagine, that we are placed in this world to get riches and honours? Would not he think that it was our duty to toil after wealth, and ſtation, and title? Nay, would not he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve we are forbidden poverty by threats of eternal pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, and enjoined to purſue our pleaſures under pain of damnation? He would certainly imagine, that we are influenced by a ſcheme of duties quite oppoſite to thoſe which are indeed preſcribed to us. And truly, according to ſuch an imagination, he muſt conclude, that we are a ſpecies of moſt obedient creatures in the univerſe; that we are conſtant to our duty; and that we keep a ſteady eye on the end for which we were ſent hither.</p>
               <p>But how great would be his aſtoniſhment, when he learned that we were beings not deſigned to exiſt in this world above thre ſcore and ten years; and that the greateſt part of this buſy ſpecies fall ſhort even of that age? How would he be loſt in horror and admiration, when he ſhould know that this ſet of creatures, who lay out all their endeavours for this life, which ſcarce de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the name of exiſtence; when, I ſay, he ſhould know that this ſet of creatures are to exiſt to all eternity in another life for which they make no preparations? Nothing can be a greater diſgrace to reaſon, than that men, who are perſuaded of theſe two different ſtates of being, ſhould be perpetually employed in providing for a life of threeſcore and ten years, and neglecting to make proviſion for that which, after many myriads of years, will be ſtill new, and ſtill in its beginning, eſpecially when we conſider that our endeavours for making our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves great, rich, or honourable, or whatever elſe we place our happineſs in, may after all prove unſucceſsful; whereas, if we conſtantly and ſincerely endeavour to make ourſelves happy in the other life, we are ſure that our endeavours will ſucceed, and that we ſhall not be diſappointed of our hope.</p>

The following queſtion is ſtarted by one of the ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:—Suppoſing the whole body of the earth were a great ball or maſs of the fineſt ſand, and that a ſingle grain or particle of this ſand ſhould be annihilated every thouſand years. Suppoſing then that you had it in your choice to be happy all the while this prodigious maſs of ſand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s conſuming by this ſlow method, till there was no grain of it left, on condition you were to be miſerable ever after, or ſuppoſing that you might be happy for ever after; on condition you ſhould be miſerable till the whole maſs of ſand were thus annihilated at the rate of one grain in a thouſand years: which of theſe two caſes would you make your choice?</p>
               <p>It muſt be confeſſed, in this caſe, ſo many thouſands of years are to the imagination as a kind of eternity, though in reality they do not bear ſo great a proportion to that duration which is to follow them, as an unit does to the greateſt number which you can put together in figures, or as one of thoſe grains of ſand to the ſuppoſed heap. Reaſon, therefore tells us, without any manner of heſitation, which would be the better part in this choice. However, as I have before intimated, our reaſon might in ſuch a caſe be ſo overſet by the imagination, as to diſpoſe ſome perſons to ſink under the conſideration of the great length of the firſt part of this duration, and of the great diſtance of that ſecond duration which is to ſucceed it. The mind, I ſay, might give itſelf to that happineſs which is at hand, conſidering that it is ſo very near, and that it would laſt ſo very long. But when the choice we actually have before us is this, Whether we will chuſe to be happy for the ſpace of only threeſcore and ten, nay perhaps of only twenty or ten years, I might ſay of only a day or an hour, and miſerable to all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; or, on the contrary, miſerable for this ſhort term of years, and happy for a whole eternity? What words are ſufficient to expreſs that folly and want of conſideration, which in ſuch a caſe would make a wrong choice!</p>
               <p>I here put a caſe even at the worſt, by ſuppoſing (what ſeldom happens) that a courſe of virtue makes us miſerable in this life: but if we ſuppoſe (as it generally happens) that virtue would make us more happy, even in this life, than a contrary courſe of vice, how can we ſufficiently condemn the ſtupidity or madneſs of thoſe
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:029518_0075_0FE1CCEAC2AE2070"/>
perſons who are capable of making ſo abſurd a choice?</p>
               <p>Every wiſe man therefore will conſider this life only as it may conduce to the happineſs of the other, and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſacrifice the pleaſures of a few years to thoſe of an eternity.</p>

               <p>IT is a celebrated thought of <hi>Socrates,</hi> That if all the misfortunes of mankind were caſt into a public ſtock, in order to be equally diſtributed among the whole ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, thoſe who now think themſelves the moſt unhappy, would prefer the ſhare they are already poſſeſſed of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that which would fall to them by ſuch a proper diviſion. <hi>Horace</hi> has carried this thought a great deal further; which implies, that the hardſhips or misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes we lie under, are more eaſy to us than thoſe of any other perſon would be, in caſe we ſhould change conditions with him.</p>
               <p>As I was ruminating on theſe two remarks, and ſeated in my elbow chair, I inſenſibly fell aſleep; when, on a ſudden, me thought there was a proclamation made by <hi>Jupiter,</hi> that every mortal ſhould bring in his griefs and calamities, and throw them together in a heap. There was a large plain appointed for this purpoſe. I took my ſtand in the centre of it, and ſaw with a great deal of pleaſure the whole human ſpecies marching one after another, and throwing down their ſeveral loads, which immediately grew up into a prodigious mountain, that ſeemed to riſe above the clouds.</p>
               <p>There was a certain lady, of a thin airy ſhape, who was very active in this ſolemnity. She carried a magnifying glaſs in one of her hands, and was clothed in a looſe flowing robe embroidered with ſeveral figures of fiends and ſpectres, that diſcovered themſelves in a thouſand chimerical ſhapes, as her garment hovered in the wind. There was ſomething wild and diſtracted in her looks. Her name was <hi>Fancy.</hi> She led up every mortal to the appointed place, after having very officiouſly aſſiſted him
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:029518_0076_0FE1CCEC5FE0B0B8"/>
in making up his pack, and laying it upon his ſhoulders. My heart melted within me to ſee my fellow creatures groaning under their reſpective burdens, and to conſider that prodigious bulk of human calamities which lay before me.</p>
               <p>There were, however, ſeveral perſons who gave, me great diverſion upon this occaſion. I obſerved one bringing in a fardel very carefully concealed under an old embroidered cloak, which, upon his throwing it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the heap, I diſcovered it to be Poverty. Another, after a great deal of puffing, threw down his luggage; which, upon examining, I found to be his wife.</p>
               <p>There were multitudes of lovers ſaddled with very whimſical burdens, compoſed of darts and flames; but what was very odd, though they ſighed as if their heart would break under theſe bundles of calamities, they could not perſuade themſelves to caſt them into the heap when they came up to it; but after a few faint efforts ſhook their heads, and marched away as heavy loaded as they came. I ſaw multitudes of old women throw down wrinkles, and ſeveral young ones who ſtripped themſelves of a tawny ſkin. There were very great heaps of red noſes, large lips, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ty teeth. The truth of it is, I was ſurpriſed to ſee the greateſt part of the mountain made up of bodily deformities. Obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one advance towards the heap with a larger cargo than ordinary upon his back, I found upon his nearer approach, that it was only a natural hump, which he diſpoſed of with great joy of heart among this collection of human miſeries. There were likewiſe diſtempers of all ſorts, though I could not but obſerve that there were many more imaginary than real. One little packet I could not but take notice <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which was a complication of all the diſeaſes incident to human nature, and was in the hand of a great many fine people: this was called the Spleen. But what moſt of all ſurpriſed me, was a remark I made, that there was not a ſingle vice or folly thrown into the whole heap: at which I was very much aſtoniſhed, having concluded within myſelf, that every one would take this opportunity of getting rid of his paſſions, prejudices, and frailties.</p>
               <p>I took notice in particular of a very profligate fellow, who I did not queſtion came loaded with his crimes;
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:029518_0076_0FE1CCEC5FE0B0B8"/>
but upon ſearching into his bundle, I found, that inſtead of throwing his guilt from him, he had only laid down his memory. He was followed by another worthleſs rogue, who flung away his modeſty inſtead of his ignorance.</p>
               <p>When the whole race of mankind had thus caſt down their burdens, the <hi>Phantom,</hi> which had been ſo buſy on this occaſion, ſeeing me an idle ſpectator of what paſſed, approached towards me. I grew uneaſy at her preſence, when on a ſudden ſhe held her magnifying glaſs full before mine eyes. I no ſooner ſaw my face in it, but was ſtartled at the ſhortneſs of it, which now appeared to me in the utmoſt aggravation. The immoderate breadth of the features made me very much out of humour with my own countenance, upon which I threw it from me like a maſk. It happened very luckily that one who ſtood by me had juſt before thrown down his viſage, which it ſeems was too long for him. It was indeed extended to a moſt ſhameful length: I believe the very chin was, (modeſtly ſpeaking) as long as my whole face. We had both of us an opportunity of mending ourſelves; and all the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions being now brought in, every man was at liberty to change his misfortunes for thoſe of another perſon. But as there aroſe many new incidents in the ſequel of my viſion, I ſhall reſerve them for the ſubject of my next paper.</p>

                  </gap>; but they were incapable either of them to recede from the choice they had made. A poor galley-ſlave, who had thrown down his chains, took up the gout in their ſtead; but made ſuch wry faces, that one might eaſily perceive he was no great gainer by the bargain. It was pleaſant enough to ſee the ſeveral exchanges that were made for ſickneſs againſt poverty, hunger againſt want of appetite, and care againſt pain.</p>
               <p>The female world were very buſy among themſelves in bartering for features: one was trucking a lock of grey hairs for a carbuncle; another was making over a ſhort waiſt for a pair of round ſhoulders, and a third cheapening a bad face for a loſt reputation: but on all theſe occaſions, there was not one of them who did not think the new blemiſh, as ſoon as ſhe had got it into her poſſeſſion much more diſagreeable than the old one. I made the ſame obſervation on every other misfortune or calamity, which every one in the aſſembly brought upon himſelf, in lies of what he had parted with: whether it be that all the evils which befall us are in ſome meaſure ſuited and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to our ſtrength, or that every ill becomes more ſupportable by our being accuſtomed to it, I ſhall not determine.</p>
               <p>I could not from my heart forbear pitying the poor
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:029518_0077_0FE1CCEDFB75FC20"/>
humpbacked gentleman mentioned in the former paper, who went off a very well-ſhaped perſon with a ſtone in his bladde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; nor the fine gentleman who had ſtruck up a bargain with him that limped through the whole aſſembly of ladies, who uſed to admire him, with a pair of ſhoulders peeping over his head.</p>
               <p>I muſt not omit my own particular adventure. My friend with the long viſage had no ſooner taken upon him my ſhort face, but he made ſuch a groteſque figure in it, that as I looked upon him I could not forbear laughing at myſelf, inſomuch that I put my own face out of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. The poor gentleman was ſo ſenſible of the ridicule, that I found he was aſhamed of what he had done: on the other ſide, I found that I myſelf had got no great reaſon to triumph; for as I went to touch my fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, I miſſed the place, and clapped my finger on my upper lip. Beſides, as my noſe was exceeding prominent, I gave it two or three unlucky knocks, as I was playing my hand about my face, and aiming at ſome other part of it. I ſaw two other gentlemen by me, who were in the ſame ridiculous circumſtances. Theſe had made a fooliſh ſwap between a couple of thick bandy legs, and two long trap-ſticks that had no calves to them. One of theſe looked like a man walking upon ſtilts, and was ſo lifted up in the air above his ordinary height, that his head turned round with it; while the other made ſuch auk-ward circles as he attempted to walk, that he ſcarce knew how to move forward upon his new ſupporters. Obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to be a very pleaſant kind of a fellow, I ſtuck my cane into the ground, and told him I would lay him a bottle of wine that he did not march up to it on a line, that I drew for him, in a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>The heap was at laſt diſtributed among the two ſexes, who made a moſt piteous ſight, as they wandered up and down under the preſſure of their ſeveral burdens. The whole plain was filled with murmurs and complaints, groans and lamentations. <hi>Jupiter</hi> at length, taking com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion upon the poor mortals, ordered them a ſecond time to lay down their loads, with a deſign to give every one his own again. They diſcharged them with a great deal of pleaſure; after which the <hi>Phantom,</hi> which had led them into ſuch groſs deluſion, was commanded to diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. There was ſent in her ſtead a goddeſs of a quite
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:029518_0078_0FE1CCFA227380F8"/>
different figure: Her motions were ſteady and compoſed, and her aſpect ſerious and cheerful. She every now and then caſt her eyes towards heaven, and fixed them upon <hi>Jupiter.</hi> Her name was <hi>Patience.</hi> She had no ſooner, placed herſelf by the Mount of Sorrows, but, what I thought very remarkable, the whole heap ſunk to ſuch a degree, that it did not appear a third part ſo big as it was before. She after wards returned every man his own proper calamity, and teaching him how to bear it in the moſt commodious manner, he marched off with it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly, being very well pleaſed that he had not been left to his own choice as to the kind of evils which fell to his lot.</p>
               <p>Beſides the ſeveral pieces of morality to be drawn out of this viſion, I learnt from it, never to repine at my own misfortunes, or to envy the happineſs of another, ſince it is impoſſible for any man to form a right judgment of his neighbour's ſufferings; for which reaſon alſo I have determined never to think too lightly of another's complaints, but to regard the ſorrows of my fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with ſentiments of humanity and compaſſion.</p>

whom the hand of Proſperity has overwhelmed with wretchedneſs. Whatever I once deſired as the means of happineſs I now poſſeſs; but I am not yet happy, and therefore I deſpair. I regret the lapſe of time, becauſe it glides away without enjoyment; and as I expect noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the future but the vanity of the paſt, I do not wiſh it ſhould arrive. Yet I tremble leſt it ſhould be cut off; and my heart ſinks when I anticipate the moment, in which eternity ſhall cloſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>over the vacuity of my life, like the ſeas upon the path of a ſhip, and leave no traces of my exiſtence more durable than the furrow which remains after the waves have united. If, in the treaſures of wiſdom, there is any precept to obtain felicity, vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe it to me: for this purpoſe have I come; a purpoſe which yet I fear to reveal, left, like all the former, it ſhould be diſappointed." <hi>Almet</hi> liſtened with looks of aſtoniſhment and pity, to this complaint of a being, in whom reaſon was known to be a pledge of immortality: but the ſerenity of his countenance ſoon returned; and ſtretching out his hands towards heaven, "Stranger," ſaid he, "the knowledge which I have received from the prophet I will communicate to thee."</p>
               <p>"As I was ſitting once at the porch of the temple, penſive and alone, mine eyes wandered among the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude that was ſcattered before me; and while-I remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the warineſs and ſolicitude which was viſible in every countenance, I was ſuddenly ſtruck with a ſenſe of their condition.

Is the fineneſs of the texture, or the ſplendor of the tints, regarded with delight by thoſe to whom cuſtom has rendered them familiar? Or can the power of habit render others inſenſible of pain, who live only to traverſe the deſart; a ſcene of dreadful uniformity, where a barren level is bounded only by the horizon; where no change of proſpect nor variety of images, relieve the traveller from a ſenſe of toil, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of whirlwinds, which in a moment may bury him in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

diamonds ſparkle with unregarded luſtre, gain from the poſſeſſion what is loſt by the wretch who ſeeks them in the mine?—Who lives excluded from the common bounties of nature; to whom even the viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of day and night is not known; who ſigns in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual darkneſs, and whoſe life is one mournful alterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of inſenſibility and labour? If thoſe are not happy who poſſeſs in proportion as thoſe are wretched who beſtow, how vain a dream is the life of man! and if there is indeed ſuch difference in the value of exiſtence, how ſhall we acquit of partiality the hand by which this difference has been made?</p>
               <p>"While my thoughts thus multiplied, and my heart burnt within me, I became ſenſible of a ſudden influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from above. The ſtreets and the crowds of <hi>Mecca</hi> diſappeared. I found myſelf ſitting on the declivity of a mountain, and perceived at my right hand an angel, whom I knew to be <hi>Azoran,</hi> the miniſter of reproof. When I ſaw him I was afraid. I caſt my eyes upon the ground, and was about to deprecate his anger, when he commanded me to be ſilent. <hi>"Almet,</hi> ſaid he, thou haſt devoted thy life to meditation, that thy counſel might deliver ignorance from the mazes of error, and deter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption from the precipice of guilt; but the book of nature thou haſt read without underſtanding: it is again open before thee; look up, conſider it, and be wiſe."</p>
               <p>"I looked up, and beheld an incloſure, beautiful as the gardens of paradiſe, but of a ſmall extent. Through the middle there was a green walk; at the end a wild deſart; and beyond, impenetrable darkneſs. The walk was ſhaded with trees of every kind, that were covered at once with bloſſoms and fruit; innumerable birds were ſinging in the branches; the graſs was intermingled with flowers, which impregnated the breeze with fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grance, and painted the path with beauty: on the one ſide flowed a gentle tranſparent ſtream, which was juſt heard to murmur over the golden ſands that ſparkled at the bottom; and on the other were walks and bowers, fountains, grottos, and caſcades, which diverſified the ſcene with endleſs variety, but did not conceal the bounds."</p>
               <p>"While I was gazing in a tranſport of delight and wonder on this enchanting ſpot, I perceived a man ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along the walk with a thoughtful and deliberate
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:029518_0079_0FE1CCFBC5E05948"/>
pace: his eyes were fixed upon the earth, and his arms croſſed on his boſom; he ſometimes ſtarted as if a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den pang had ſeized him; his countenance expreſſed ſolicitude and terror: he looked round with a ſigh, and having gazed a moment on the deſart that lay before him, he ſeemed as if he wiſhed to ſtop, but was impelled forward by ſome inſenſible power: his features, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſoon ſettled again into a calm melancholy; his eyes were again fixed on the ground, and he went on as before with apparent reluctance, but without emotion. I was ſtruck with this appearance; and turning haſtily to the angel, was about to inquire what could produce ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felicity in a being ſurrounded with every object that could gratify every ſenſe; but he prevented my requeſt: "The book of nature, ſaid he, is before thee; look up, conſider it and be wiſe." I looked, and beheld a valley between two mountains that were craggy and barren: on the path there was, no verdure, and the mountains afforded no ſhade: the ſun burnt in the zenith, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſpring was dried up: but the valley terminated in a country that was pleaſant and fertile, ſhaded with woods, and adorned with buildings. At a ſecond view, I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered a man in this valley, meagre indeed and naked, but his countenance was cheerful, and his deportment active: he kept his eye fixed upon the country before him, and looked as if he would have run, but that he was reſtrained, as the other had been impelled, by ſome ſecret influence: ſometimes, indeed, I perceived a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den expreſſion of pain, and ſometimes he ſtepped ſhort as if his foot was pierced by the aſperities of the way; but the ſprightlineſs of his countenance inſtantly return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and he paſſed forward without appearance of repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or complaint."</p>
               <p>I turned again towards the angel, impatient to inquire from what ſecret ſource happineſs was derived, in a ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation ſo different from that in which it might have been expected? But he again prevented my requeſt: <hi>"Almet,</hi> ſaid he, remember what thou haſt ſeen, and let this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial be written upon the tablet of thine heart. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, <hi>Almet,</hi> that the world in which thou art placed is but the road to another; and that happineſs depends not upon the path, but the end. The value of this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of thy exiſtence is fixed by hope and fear. The
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:029518_0080_0FE1CCFD66ED9380"/>
wretch who wiſhed to linger in the garden, who looked round upon its limits with terror, was deſtitute of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe he was deſtitute of hope, and was perpet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually tormented by the dread of loſing that which he did not enjoy. The ſong of the birds had been repeated till it was not heard, and the flowers had ſo often recurred, that their beauty was not ſeen; the river glided by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noticed, and he feared to lift his eye to the proſpect, left he ſhould behold the waſte that circumſcribed it. But he that toiled through the valley was happy, becauſe he looked forward with hope. Thus, to the ſojourner upon earth, it is of little moment, whether the path he treads be ſtrewed with flowers or with thorns, if he perceive himſelf to approach thoſe regions, in compariſon of which the thorns and the flowers of this wilderneſs loſe their diſtinction, and are both alike impotent to give pleaſure or pain.</p>
               <p>"What then has Eternal Wiſdom unequally diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? That which can make every ſtation happy, and without which every ſtation muſt be wretched, is acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by virtue; and virtue is poſſible to all. Remember, <hi>Almet,</hi> the viſion which thou haſt ſeen; and let my words be written on the tablet of thy heart, that thou mayſt direct the wanderer to happineſs, and juſtify God to man."</p>
               <p>While the voice of <hi>Azoran</hi> was yet founding in my ear, the proſpect vaniſhed from before me, and I found my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf again ſitting at the porch of the temple. The ſun was gone down, the multitude was retired to reſt, and the ſolemn quiet of midnight concurred with the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my doubts to complete the tranquillity of my mind.</p>
               <p>Such, my ſon, was the viſion which the prophet vouchſafed me, not for my ſake only, but for thine. Thou haſt ſought felicity in temporal things; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou art diſappointed.

               <p>GOING yeſterday to dine with an old acquaintance, I had the misfortune to find his whole family very much dejected. Upon aſking him the occaſion of it, he told me that his wife had dreamt a very ſtrange dream the night before, which they were afraid portended ſome misfortune to themſelves or to their children. At her coming into the room I obſerved a ſettled melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in her countenance, which I ſhould have been troubled for, had I not heard from whence it proceeded. We were no ſooner ſet down, but after having looked upon me a little while, "My dear, ſays ſhe, turning to her huſband, you may now ſee the ſtranger that was in the candle laſt night." Soon after this, as they began to talk of family affairs, a little boy at the other end of the table told her, that he was to go into joining hand on <hi>Thurſday: "Thurſday!</hi> ſays ſhe, no child, if it pleaſe God, you ſhall not begin upon <hi>Childer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>as-day;</hi> tell your writing-maſter that <hi>Friday</hi> will be ſoon enough." I was reflecting within myſelf on the oddneſs of her fancy, and wondering that any body would eſtabliſh it as a rule to loſe a day in every week. In the midſt of theſe my mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, ſhe deſired me to reach her a little ſalt upon the point of my knife, which I did, in ſuch a trepidation and hurry of obedience, that I let it drop by the way; at which ſhe immediately ſtartled, and ſaid it fell towards her.</p>
               <p>Upon this I looked very black; and obſerving the concern of the whole table, began to conſider myſelf, with ſome confuſion, as a perſon that had brought a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſter upon the family. The lady, however, recovering herſelf, after a little ſpace, ſaid to her huſband, with a ſigh, "My dear, misfortunes never come ſingle." My friend, I found, acted but an under part at his table, and being a man of more good nature than underſtanding, thinks himſelf obliged to fall in with all the paſſions and

                  </gap>oſt brought us an account of the battle of <hi>Almanza."</hi> The reader may gueſs at the figure I made, after having done all this miſchief. I diſpatched my dinner as faſt as I could, with my uſual taciturnity; when, to my utter confuſion, the lady ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me quitting my knife and fork, and laying them acroſs one another upon my plate, deſired me that I would humour her ſo far as to take them out of that fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, and place them ſide by ſide. What the abſurdity was which I had committed I did not know, but I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe there was ſome traditionary ſuperſtition in it; and therefore, in obedience to the lady of the houſe, I diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of my knife and fork in two parallel lines, which is a figure I ſhall always lay them in for the future, though I do not know any reaſon for it.</p>
               <p>It is not difficult for a man to ſee that a perſon has conceived an averſion to him. For my own part, I quickly found, by the lady's looks, that ſhe regarded me as a very odd kind of a fellow, with an unfortunate aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect: for which reaſon I took my leave immediately after dinner, and withdrew to my own lodgings. Upon my return home, I fell into a profound contemplation on the evils that attend thoſe ſuperſtitious follies of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; how they ſubject us to imaginary afflictions, and additional ſorrows, that do not properly come within our lot. As if the natural calamities of life were not ſufficient for it, we turn the moſt indifferent circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces into miſfortunes, and ſuffer as much from trifling accidents as from real evils. I have known the ſhooting of a ſtar ſpoil a night's reſt; and have ſeen a man in love grow pale and loſe his appetite, upon the plucking of a merry thought. A ſcreech owl at midnight has alarmed a family more than a band of robbers; nay, the voice of a cricket has ſtruck more terror than the roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a lion. There is nothing ſo inconſiderable, which may not appear dreadful to an imagination filled with omens and prognoſtics. A ruſty nail, or crooked pin, ſhoots up into prodigies.</p>

unluckily obſerved there were thirteen of us in company. The remark ſtruck a panic of terror into ſeveral who were preſent, inſomuch that one or two of the ladies were going to leave the room; but a friend of mine taking notice that one of our female companions was big with child, affirmed there were fourteen in the room, and that inſtead of portending that one of the company ſhould die, it plainly foretold that one of them ſhould be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>An old maid, that is troubled with the vapours, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces infinite diſturbances of this kind among her friends and neighbours.

               <p>With the ſame kind of anxious veneration I have, for many years, been making obſervations on the life of <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus,</hi> a man whom all his acquaintances have, from his firſt appearance in the world, feared for the quickneſs of his diſcernment, and admired for the multiplicity of his attainments; but whoſe progreſs in life, and whoſe uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to mankind, have perhaps been hindered by the ſuperfluity of his knowledge, and the celerity of his mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polyphilus</hi> was remarkable at the ſchool for ſurpaſſing all his companions, without any viſible application. And at the univerſity was diſtinguiſhed equally for his ſucceſsful progreſs, as well through the rough and thorny mazes of ſcience, as the ſmooth and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

               <p>When <hi>Polyphilus</hi> was at the age in which men uſually chuſe their profeſſion, and prepare to enter into a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic character, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> eye was fixed upon him; and all were curious to inquire what this univerſal genius would fix upon for the employment of life: and no doubt was made but that he would leave all his cotem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries behind him; and mount to the higheſt honours of that claſs in which he ſhould enliſt himſelf, without thoſe delays and pauſes which muſt always be endured by meaner abilities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polyphilus,</hi> though by no means inſolent or aſſuming, had been ſufficiently encouraged by uninterrupted ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, to place great confidence in his own parts; and was not below his companions in the indulgence of his hopes, and expectations of the aſtoniſhment with which the world would be ſtruck, when firſt his luſtre ſhould break ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

their feeble luſtre, were now doomed to fade away before him.</p>
               <p>It is natural for a man to catch advantageous notions of the condition which thoſe with whom he converſes, are ſtriving to attain. <hi>Polyphilus,</hi> in a ramble to <hi>London,</hi> fell accidentally among the phyſicians; and was ſo much pleaſed with the proſpect of turning philoſophy to profit, and ſo highly delighted with a new theory of fevers, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> into his imagination, and which, after having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in a few hours, he found himſelf able to maintain againſt all the advocates for the ancient ſyſtem, that he reſolved to apply himſelf to anatomy, botany, and chym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtry; and to leave no part unconquered, either of the animal, mineral, or vegetable kingdoms.</p>
               <p>He therefore read authors, conſtructed ſyſtems, and fried experiments. But unhappily, as he was going to ſee a new plant in flower at <hi>Chelſea,</hi> he met, (in croſſing <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to take the water,) the chancellor's coach. He had the curioſity to follow him into the hall; where a remarkable cauſe happened to be tried; he found himſelf able to produce ſo many arguments which the lawyers had omitted on both ſides, that he determined to quit phyſic for a profeſſion in which he found it would be ſo eaſy to excel; and which promiſed higher honors and larger profits, without melancholy attendance upon miſery, mean ſubmiſſion to peeviſhneſs, and continued interruption to reſt and pleaſure.</p>
               <p>He immediately took chambers in the <hi>Temple,</hi> bought a common place book, and confined himſelf for ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to the peruſal of the ſtatutes, year-books, plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and reports. He was a conſtant hoarer of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in the courts, and began to put caſes with reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able accuracy.—But he ſoon diſcovered, by conſidering the fortune of lawyers, that preferment was not to be got by acuteneſs, learning, and eloquence. He was perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the abſurdities of attornies, and miſrepreſentations made by his clients of their own cauſes; by the uſeleſs anxiety of one, and the inceſſant importunity of another. He began to repent of having devoted himſelf to a ſtudy, which was ſo narrow in its comprehenſion, which could never carry his name to any other country; and thought it unworthy of a man of parts, to ſell his life only for money. The barrenneſs of his fellow-ſtudents forced
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:029518_0084_0FE1CD0EBB406560"/>
him generally into other company, at his hours of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment: and, among the varieties of converſation through which his curioſity was daily wandering, he, by chance, mingled at a tavern with ſome intelligent officers of the army. A man of letters was eaſily dazzled with the gaiety of their appearance, and ſoftened into kindneſs by the politeneſs of their addreſs. He therefore cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this new acquaintance; and when he ſaw how readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they found, in every place, admiſſion and regard, and how familiarly they mingled with every rank and order of men, he began to feel his heart beat for military hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours; and wondered how the prejudices of the univerſity ſhould have made him ſo long inſenſible of that ambition, which had fired ſo many hearts in every age, and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of that calling, which is above all others, univerſally and invariably illuſtrious, and which gives, even to the exterior appearance of its profeſſors, a dignity and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom unknown to the reſt of mankind.</p>
               <p>Theſe favourable impreſſions were made ſtill deeper by his converſation with the ladies; whoſe regard for ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers he could not obſerve without wiſhing himſelf one of that happy fraternity, to which the female world ſeem to have devoted all their charms and their kindneſs. The love of knowledge, which was ſtill his predominant inclination, was gratified by the recital of adventures, and accounts of foreign countries; and therefore he thought there was no way of life in which all his views could ſo completely concenter as in that of a ſoldier. In the art of war, he thought it not difficult to excel, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obſerved his new friends not very much verſed in the principles of tactics or fortification: and therefore he ſtudied all the military writers, both ancient and modern; and in a ſhort time, could tell how to have gained every remarkable battle that had been loſt from the beginning of the world. He often ſhewed at a table, how <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhould have been checked in his conqueſts; what was the fatal error at <hi>Pharſalia;</hi> how <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Sweden</hi> might have eſcaped his ruin at <hi>Poltowa,</hi> and how <hi>Marlborough</hi> might have been made to repent his temerity at <hi>Blenheim.</hi> He entrenched armies upon paper, ſo that no ſuperiority of numbers could force them; and modelled in clay ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny impregnable fortreſſes, on which the preſent arts of attack would be exhauſted without effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="unknown:029518_0084_0FE1CD0EBB406560"/>
                  <hi>Polyphilus</hi> in a ſhort time obtained a commiſſion; but before he could rub off the ſolemnity of a ſcholar, and gain the true air of military vivacity, a war was declared, and forces ſent to the continent. Here <hi>Polyphilus</hi> unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily found, that ſtudy alone would not make a ſoldier: for, being much accuſtomed to think the ſenſe of danger ſunk into his mind, he felt at the approach of any action tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> terror which a ſentence of death would have brought upon him. He ſaw, that inſtead of conquering their fears, the endeavours of his gay friends were only to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape them: but his philoſophy chained his mind to its object; and rather loaded him with ſhackles, than fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him with arms. He however ſuppreſſed his miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in ſilence, and paſſed through the campaign with honour; but found himſelf utterly unable to ſupport another.</p>
               <p>He then had recourſe again to his books, and contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ange from one ſtudy to another. As I uſually viſit him once a month, and am admitted to him without previous notice, I have found him within this laſt half year decyphering the <hi>Chineſe</hi> language, making a farce, collecting a vocabulary of the obſolete terms of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> law, writing an Inquiry concerning the ancient <hi>Corinthian</hi> braſs, and forming a new ſcheme of the varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the needle.</p>
               <p>Thus his powerful genius which might have extended the ſphere of any ſcience, or benefited the world in any profeſſion, is diſſipated in a boundleſs variety, without any profit to others or to himſelf. He makes ſudden irruptions into the regions of knowledge, and ſees all obſtacles give way before him; but he never ſtays long enough to complete his conqueſt, to eſtabliſh laws, or bring away the ſpoils.</p>
               <p>Such is often the folly of thoſe men, whom nature has enabled to obtain ſkill and knowledge on terms ſo eaſy, that they have no ſenſe of the value of the acquiſition; who are qualified to make ſuch ſpeedy progreſs in learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they think themſelves at liberty to loiter in the way: and often, by turning aſide after every new object like <hi>Atalanta,</hi> loſe the race to ſlower competitors, who preſs diligently forward, and whoſe force is directed to a ſingle point.</p>
               <p>I have often thought them happy that have been fixed,
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:029518_0085_0FE1BA1284FAEAE8"/>
from the firſt dawn of thought, in a determination to ſome ſtate of life, by the choice of one whoſe authority may preclude caprice, and whoſe influence may prejudice them in the favour of his opinion. The general precept of conſulting the genius is of little uſe, unleſs we are told how the genius can be known. If it is to be diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered only by experiment, life will be loſt before the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution can be fixed; if any other inclinations are to be found, they may perhaps be very early diſcerned. At leaſt, if to miſcarry in an attempt be a proof of having miſtaken the direction of the genius, men appear not leſs frequently deceived with regard to themſelves than to others: and therefore no one has much reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that his life was planned out by friends; or to be confident that he ſhould have had either more honor or happineſs, by being abandoned to the chance of his own fancy.</p>
               <p>It was ſaid of the learned <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> that when he was preparing his lectures, he heſitated ſo much, and rejected ſo often, that at the time of reading he was often forced to produce, not what was beſt, but what happened to be at hand. This will be the ſtate of every man, who, in the choice of his employment, balances all the arguments on every ſide. The complication is ſo intricate, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and objections ſo numerous; there is ſo much play for the inclination, and ſo much remains in the power of others, that (reaſon forced at laſt to reſt in neutraility) the deciſion devolves into the hands of chance; and after a great part of life ſpent in inquiries which can never be reſolved, the reſt muſt often paſs in repenting the unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary delay; and can be uſeful to few other purpoſes, than to warn others againſt the ſame folly; and to ſhew that of two ſtates of life, equally conſiſtent with religion and virtue, he who chuſes earlieſt, and perſeveres in it, chuſeſt beſt.</p>
               <p>It is therefore of the utmoſt importance, that all who have any intention of doing well for themſelves or others, and of acquiring a reputation ſuperior to the common names which are hourly ſinking into oblivion, and ſwept away by time among the refuſe of fame, ſhould add to their reaſon and ſpirit the power of perſiſting in their purpoſe; ſince all the performances of human art, at which we look with praiſe or wonder, are inſtances of the
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:029518_0085_0FE1BA1284FAEAE8"/>
reſiſtleſs force of perſeverance. It is by this that the quarry becomes a pyramid, and that diſtant countries are united by canals. If a man were to compare the effects of a ſingle ſtroke of the pick axe, or of one im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the ſpade, with the general deſign and laſt effect, he would be overwhelmed by the ſenſe of their diſproportion: Yet thoſe petty operations, inceſſantly continued, at laſt ſurmount the greateſt difficulties; and mountains are levelled, and oceans bounded by the ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der force of human beings.</p>

               <p>I HAVE ſometimes heard it diſputed in converſation, whether it be more laudable or deſirable, that a man ſhould think too highly or too meanly of himſelf: it is on all hands agreed to be beſt, that he ſhould think right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but ſince a falliable being will always make ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viations from exact rectitude, it is not wholly uſeleſs to inquire towards which ſide it is ſafer to incline.</p>
               <p>The prejudices of mankind ſeem to favour him who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>The opinion which a man entertains of himſelf, ought to be diſtinguiſhed, in order to an accurate diſcuſſion of this queſtion, as it relates to perſons or to things. To think highly of ourſelves in compariſon with others, to aſſume by our own authority that precedence which none are willing to grant, muſt be always invidious and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive; but to rate our powers high in proportion to things, and imagine ourſelves equal to great undertakings, while we leave others in poſſeſſion of the ſame abilities, cannot with equal juſtice provoke cenſure.</p>
               <p>

It muſt be confeſſed, that ſelf-love may diſpoſe us to decide too haſtily in our own favour; but who is hurt by the miſtake? If we are incited by this vain opinion to attempt more than we can perform, ours is the labour, and ours is the diſgrace.</p>
               <p>But he that dares to think well of himſelf, will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways prove to be miſtaken; and the good effects of his confidence will then appear in great attempts, and great performances: if he ſhould not fully complete his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, he will at leaſt advance it ſo far, as to leave an eaſy taſk for him what ſucceeds him; and even though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But from the oppoſite error, from torpid deſpondency can come no advantage; it is the froſt of the ſoul which binds up all its powers, and congeals life in perpetual ſterility. He that has no hopes of ſucceſs, will make no attempts; and where nothing is attempted, nothing will be done.</p>
               <p>Every man ſhould, therefore, endeavour to maintain in himſelf a favourable opinion of the powers of the human mind; which are, perhaps, in every man greater than they appear, and might, by diligent cultivation, be exalted to a degree beyond what their poſſeſſor preſumes to believe. There is ſcarce any man but has found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf able, at the inſtigation of neceſſity, to do what in a ſtate of leiſure and deliberation he would have concluded impoſſible; and ſome of our ſpecies have ſignalized themſelves by ſuch atchievements, as prove there are few things above human hope.</p>
               <p>It has been the policy of all nations to preſerve, by ſome public monuments, the memory of thoſe who have ſerved their country by great exploits <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>Among the favourites of nature that have from time to time appeared in the world, enriched with various endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and contrarieties of excellence, none ſeems to have been more exalted above the common rate of humanity, than the man known about two centuries ago by the

appellation of the Admirable <hi>Crichton;</hi> of whoſe hiſtory, whatever we may ſuppreſs as ſurpaſſing credibility, yet we ſhall, upon inconteſtible authority, relate enough to rank him among prodigies.</p>
               <p>Virtue, ſays <hi>Virgil,</hi> is better accepted when it comes in a pleaſing form. The perſon of <hi>Crichton</hi> was eminently beautiful; but his beauty was conſiſtent with ſuch activ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and ſtrength, that in fencing he would ſpring at one bound the length of twenty feet upon his antagoniſt; and he uſed the ſword in either hand with ſuch force and dexterity, that ſcarce any one had courage to engage him.</p>
               <p>Having ſtudied at St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> he went to <hi>Paris</hi> in his twenty-firſt year, and affixed on the gate of the college of <hi>Navarre,</hi> a kind of challenge to the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of that univerſity, to diſpute with them on a certain day; offering to his opponents, whoever they might be, the choice of ten languages, and of all the faculties and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

After a diſputation of nine hours, he was preſented by the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and profeſſors with a diamond and purſe of gold, and diſmiſſed with repeated acclamations.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Paris</hi> he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he made the ſame challenge, and had in the preſence of the Pope and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals the ſame ſucceſs. Afterwards he contracted at <hi>Venice</hi> an acquaintance with <hi>Aldus Manutius,</hi> by whom he was introduced to the learned of that city; he then viſited <hi>Padua,</hi> where he engaged in another public diſputation, beginning his performance with an extempore poem in praiſe of the city and the aſſembly then preſent, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding with an oration equally unpremeditated in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of ignorance.</p>
               <p>He afterwards publiſhed another challenge, in which he declared himſelf ready to detect the errors of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and all his commentators, either in the common forms of logic, or in any which his antagoniſts ſhould propoſe, of an hundred different kinds of verſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe acquiſitions of learning, however ſtupendous,

The Duke with ſome reluctance conſented; and on the day fixed, the combatants appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: their weapons ſeemed to have been the ſingle rapier, which was then newly introduced into <hi>Italy.</hi> The prize-fighter advanced with greater violence and fierceneſs, while <hi>Crichton</hi> contented himſelf calmly to ward his paſſes, and ſuffered him to exhauſt his vigour by his own fury.

                  <hi>Crichton</hi> then became the aſſailant; and preſſed upon him with ſuch force and agility, that he thruſt him thrice through the body, and ſaw him expire. He then divided the prize he had won, among the windows whoſe huſbands had been killed.</p>

               <p>The Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> having received ſo many proofs of his various merit, made him tutor to his ſon <hi>Vincentia de Conzaga,</hi> a prince of looſe manners and turbulent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.

               <p>BODILY labour is of two kinds, either that which a man ſubmits to for his livelihood, or that which
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:029518_0088_0FE1CD2279F017A0"/>
he undergoes for his pleaſure. The latter of them gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally changes the name of labour for that of exerciſe, but differs only from ordinary labour as it riſes from another motive.</p>
               <p>A country life abounds in both theſe kinds of labour, and for that reaſon gives a man a greater ſtock of health, and conſequently a more perfect enjoyment of himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than any other way of life. I conſider the body as a ſyſtem of tubes and glands; or, to uſe a more ruſtic phraſe, a bundle of pipes and ſtrainers, fitted to one another after ſo wonderful a manner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as to make a prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er engine for the ſoul to work with. This deſcription does not only comprehend the bowels, bones, tendons, veins, nerves, and arteries, but every muſcle, every liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is a compoſition of fibres, that are ſo many imperceptible tubes or pipes interwoven on all ſides with inviſible glands or ſtrainers.</p>
               <p>The general idea of a human body, without conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in the niceties of anatomy, lets us ſee how abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary labour is for the right preſervation of it. There muſt be frequent motions and agitations, to mix, digeſt, and ſeparate the juices contained in it, as well as to clear and cleanſe that infinitude of pipes and ſtrainers of which it is compoſed, and to give their ſolid parts a more firm and laſting tone. Labour or exerciſe ferments the humours, caſts them into their proper channel, throws off redundancies, and helps nature in thoſe ſecret diſtributions, without which the body cannot ſubſiſt in its vigour, nor the ſoul act with cheerfulneſs.</p>
               <p>I might here mention the effects which this has upon all the faculties of the mind, by keeping the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clear, the imagination untroubled, and refining thoſe ſpirits that are neceſſary for the proper exertion of our intellectual faculties, during the preſent laws of union between ſoul and body. It is to a neglect in this particular that we muſt aſcribe the ſpleen, which is ſo frequent in men of ſtudious and ſedentary tempers; as well as the vapours, to which thoſe of the other ſex are ſo often ſubject. Had not exerciſe been abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for our well-being, nature would not have made the body ſo proper for it, by giving ſuch an activity to the limbs, and ſuch a plenty to every part, as neceſſarily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce theſe compreſſions, extenſions, contortions, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

and all other kinds of motions, that are neceſſary for the preſervation of ſuch a ſyſtem of tubes and glands, as haſt been before mentioned. And that we might not want inducement to engage us in ſuch an exerciſe of the body as is proper for its welfare, it is ſo ordered, that nothing valuable can be procured without it. Not to mention riches and honour, even food and raiment are not to be come at, without the toil of the hands and ſweat of the brow. Providence furniſhes materials, but expects that we ſhould work them up ourſelves. The earth muſt be laboured before it gives its increaſe; and when it is forced into its ſeveral products, how many hands muſt they paſs through before they are fit for uſe! manufactures, trade, and agriculture, naturally employ more than nineteen parts of the ſpecies in twenty; and as for thoſe who are not obliged to labour, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in which they are born, they are more miſerable than the reſt of mankind, unleſs they indulge themſelves in that voluntary labour which goes by the name of Exerciſe.</p>
               <p>As I am a compound of ſoul and body, I conſider my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as obliged to a double ſcheme of duties; and I think I have not fulfilled the buſineſs of the day, when I do not thus employ the one in labour and exerciſe, as well as the other in contemplation and ſtudy.</p>

               <p>THERE is a ſtory in the <hi>Arabian Nights Tales,</hi> of a king who had long languiſhed under an ill habit of body, and had taken abundance of remedies to no purpoſe. At length, ſays the fable, a phyſician cured him by the following method: he took a hollow ball of wood, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

early in the morning with thoſe rightly prepared in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, till ſuch time as he ſhould ſweat. When, as the ſtory goes, the virtue of the medicaments perſpiring through the wood, had ſo good an influence on the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's conſtitution, that they cured him of an indiſpoſition which all the compoſitions he had taken inwardly had not been able to remove. This eaſtern allegory is finely contrived to ſhew us how beneficial bodily labour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to health, and that exerciſe is the moſt effectual phyſic. I ſhall in this place recommend another great preſervative of health, which in many caſes produces the ſame effect as exerciſe, and may, in ſome meaſure, ſupply its place where opportunities of exerciſe are wanting. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative I am ſpeaking of is temperance, which has thoſe particular advantages above all other means of health, that it may be practiſed by all ranks and conditions, at any ſeaſon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> exerciſe throws off all ſuperfluities, temperance prevents them; if exerciſe clears the veſſels, temperance neither ſatiates nor overſtrains them; if exerciſe raiſe proper ferments in the humours, and promotes the circulation of the blood, temperance gives nature her full play, and enables her to exert herſelf in all her force and vigour. If exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe diſſipates a growing diſtemper, temperance ſtarves it.</p>
               <p>Phyſic, for the moſt part, is nothing elſe but the ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of exerciſe or temperance. Medicines are indeed abſolutely neceſſary in acute diſtempers, that cannot wait the ſlow operations of theſe two great inſtruments of health; but did men live in an habitual courſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe and temperance, there would be but little occaſion for them. Accordingly we find that thoſe parts of the world are moſt healthy, where they ſubſiſt by the chace; and that men lived longeſt when their lives were employed in hunting, and when they had little food beſides what they caught. Bliſtering, cupping, and bleeding, are ſeldom of uſe but to the idle and intemperate; as all thoſe inward applications, which are ſo much in practice among us, are for the moſt part nothing elſe but expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents to make luxury conſiſtent with health. The apoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecary is perpetually employed in countermining the cook and the vintner. It is ſaid of <hi>Diogenes,</hi> that meeting a

Would not he have thought the maſter of a family mad, and have begged his ſervants to tie down his hands, had he ſeen him devour fowl, fiſh, and fleſh; ſwallow oil and vinegar, wines and ſpices; throw down ſallads of twenty different herbs, ſauces of an hundred ingredients, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>Nature delights in the moſt plain and ſimple diet. Every animal, but man, keeps to one diſh. Herbs are the food of this ſpecies, fiſh of that, and fleſh of a third. Man falls upon every thing that comes in his way; not the ſmalleſt fruit or excreſcence of the earth, ſcarce a berry or muſhroom can eſcape him.</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible to lay down any determinate rule for temperance, becauſe what is luxury in one may be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance in another; but there are few that have lived any time in the world who are not judges of their own conſtitution, ſo far as to know what kinds and what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of food do beſt agree with them. Were I to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider my readers as my patients, and to preſcribe ſuch a kind of temperance as is accommodated to all perſons, and ſuch as is particularly ſuited to our climate and way of living, I would copy the following rules of a very em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inent phyſician. Make your whole repaſt out of one diſh. If you indulge in a ſecond, avoid drinking any thing ſtrong until you have finiſhed your meal: at the ſame time, abſtain from all ſauces, or at leaſt from ſuch as are not the moſt plain and ſimple. A man could not well be guilty of gluttony, if he ſtuck to theſe few obvious and eaſy rules. In the firſt caſe there would be no variety of taſtes to ſolicit his palate, and occaſion exceſs; nor in the ſecond, any artificial provocatives to relieve ſatiety, and create a falſe appetite. Were I to preſcribe a rule for
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:029518_0090_0FE1CD2DCF03F6B0"/>
drinking, it would be formed upon a ſaying quoted by Sir <hi>William Temple; The firſt glaſs for myſelf, the ſecond for my friends, the third for good humour, and the fourth for my enemies.</hi> But becauſe it is impoſſible for one who lives in the world to diet himſelf always in ſo philoſophical a manner, I think every man ſhould have his days of abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, according as his conſtitution will permit. Theſe are great reliefs to nature, as they qualify it for ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling with hunger and thirſt, whenever any diſtemper or duty of life puts it upon ſuch difficulties; and at the ſame time give it an opportunity of extricating itſelf from its oppreſſions, and recovering the ſeveral tones and ſprings of its diſtended veſſels. Beſides, that abſtinence well-timed often kills a ſickneſs in embrio, and deſtroys the firſt ſeeds of an indiſpoſition. It is obſerved by two or three ancient authors, that <hi>Socrates,</hi> notwithſtanding he lives in <hi>Athens</hi> during the great plague which has made ſo much noiſe throughout all ages, and has been celebrated at different times by ſuch eminent hands: I ſay, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that he lived in the time of this devouring peſtilence, he never caught the leaſt infection, which thoſe writers unanimouſly aſcribe to that uninterrupted temperance which he always obſerved.</p>
               <p>And here I cannot but mention an obſervation which I have often made, upon reading the lives of the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and comparing it with any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

If we conſider theſe ancient ſages, a great part of whoſe philoſophy conſiſted in a temperate and abſtemious courſe of life, one would think the life of a philoſopher and the life of a man, were of two different dates: for we find the generality of theſe wiſe men were nearer an hundred than ſixty years of age at the time of their reſpective deaths.</p>

received by the maſter of it. <hi>Cremes,</hi> for that was the maſter's name, though but a young man, was infirm and ſickly.—Of ſeveral diſhes ſerved up to ſupper, <hi>Cremes</hi> obſerved that his gueſt eat but of one, and that the moſt ſimple; nor could all his intreaties prevail on him to do otherwiſe. He was, nothwithſtanding, highly delighted with <hi>Eſculapius'</hi> converſation, in which he obſerved a cheerfulneſs and knowledge ſuperior to any thing he had hitherto met with. The next morning <hi>Eſculapius</hi> took his leave, but not till he had engaged his good-natured hoſt to pay him a viſit at a ſmall villa, a few miles from thence, where he informed him of his dwelling. <hi>Cremes</hi> came accordingly, and was moſt kindly received; but how great was his amazement, when ſupper was ſerved up, to ſee nought but milk, honey, and a few roots, dreſſed in the plaineſt but neateſt manner, to which hunger, cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and good ſenſe, were the only ſauces. <hi>Eſculapius</hi> ſeemed to eat with pleaſure, while <hi>Cremes</hi> ſcarce taſted of them. On which a repaſt was ordered more ſuitable to our gueſt's taſte. Immediately there ſucceeded a banquet compoſed of the moſt artful diſhes that luxury could invent, with great plenty and variety of the richeſt and moſt intoxicating wines.

Would you be happy, be temperate: temperance is the parent of health, virtue, wiſdom, plenty, and every thing that can make you happy in this, or the world to come. It is indeed the true luxury of life; for without it life cannot be enjoyed." This ſaid, he diſappeared, and left <hi>Cremes</hi> (inſtead of an elegant apartment) in an open plain, full of ideas quite different from thoſe he had brought with him. On his return home, from the moſt luxurious he became one of the moſt temperate men, by which wiſe method he ſoon regained health.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of cries as aſtoniſhed the philoſopher. Upon his aſking what they meant, <hi>Jupiter</hi> told him they were the prayers that were ſent up to him from the earth. <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipus,</hi> amidſt the confuſion of voices, which was ſo great that nothing leſs than the ear of <hi>Jove</hi> could diſtinguiſh them, heard the words <hi>riches, honour, long life,</hi> repeated in ſeveral different tones and languages. When the firſt hubbub of ſounds was over, the trap-door being left open, the voices came up more ſeparate and diſtinct. The firſt prayer was a very odd one; it came from <hi>Athens,</hi> and deſired <hi>Jupiter</hi> to increaſe the wiſdom and the beard of his humble ſuppliant. <hi>Mennipus</hi> knew it, by the voice, to be the prayer of his friend <hi>Lycander,</hi> the philoſopher. This was ſucceeded by the petition of one who had juſt
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:029518_0091_0FE1CD31AF51D0B8"/>
laden a ſhip, and promiſed <hi>Jupiter,</hi> if he took care of it, and returned it home again full of riches, he would make him an offering of a ſilver cup. <hi>Jupiter</hi> thanked him for nothing; and bending down his ear more attentively than ordinary, heard a voice complaining to him of the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of an <hi>Epheſian</hi> widow, and begging him to breed compaſſion in her heart: this, ſays <hi>Jupiter,</hi> is a very hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt fellow. I have received a great deal of incenſe from him; I will not be ſo cruel to him as to hear his prayers. He was then interrupted with a whole volley of vows, which were made for the health of a tyrannical prince by his ſubjects, who prayed for him in his preſence. <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipus</hi> was ſurpriſed, after having liſtened to prayers offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up with ſo much ardour and devotion, to hear low whiſpers from the ſame aſſembly, expoſtulating with <hi>Jove</hi> for ſuffering ſuch a tyrant to live, and aſking how his thunder could lie idle? <hi>Jupiter</hi> was ſo offended at theſe prevaricating raſcals, that he took down the firſt vows, and puffed away the laſt. The philoſopher, ſeeing a great cloud mounting upwards, and making its way di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the trap-door, inquired of <hi>Jupiter</hi> what it meant. This, ſays <hi>Jupiter,</hi> is the ſmoke of a whole hecatomb that is offered me by the general of an army, who is very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate with me to let him cut off an hundred thouſand men that are drawn up in array againſt him: what does the impudent wretch think I ſee in him, to believe that I will make a ſacrifice of ſo many mortals as good as himſelf, and all this to his glory, forſooth?—But hark, ſays <hi>Jupiter,</hi> there is a voice I never heard but in time of danger; it is a rogue that is ſhipwrecked in the <hi>IonianSea:</hi> I ſaved him upon a plank but three days ago, upon his promiſe to mend his manners; the ſcoundrel is not worth a groat, and yet has the impudence to offer me a temple if I will keep him from ſinking. But yonder, ſays he, is a ſpecial youth for you; he deſires me to take his father, who keeps a great eſtate from him, out of the miſeries of human life. The old fellow ſhall live till he make his heart ache, I can tell him that for his pains. This was followed by the ſoft voice of a pious lady, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring <hi>Jupiter</hi> that ſhe might appear amiable and charming in the ſight of her Emperor. As the philoſopher was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting on this extraordinary petition, there blew a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle wind through the trap-door, which he at firſt miſtook
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:029518_0092_0FE1CD3350E14618"/>
for a gale of <hi>zephyrs,</hi> but afterwards found it to be a breeze of ſighs: they ſmelt ſtrong of flowers and incenſe, and were ſucceeded by moſt paſſionate complaints of wounds and torment, fire and arrows, cruelty, deſpair, and death. <hi>Mennipus</hi> fancied that ſuch lamentable cries aroſe from ſome general execution, or from wretches ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the torture; but <hi>Jupiter</hi> told him, they came to him from the iſle of <hi>Paphos,</hi> and that he every day received complaints of the ſame nature from that whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical tribe of mortals who are called Lovers. I am ſo trifled with, ſays he, by this generation of both ſexes, and find it ſo impoſſible to pleaſe them, whether I grant or refuſe their petitions, that I ſhall order a weſtern wind for the future to intercept them in their paſſage, and blow them at random upon the earth. The laſt petition I heard was from a very aged man, near a hundred years old, begging but for one year more of life, and then promiſed to die contented. This is the rareſt old fellow, ſays <hi>Jupiter;</hi> he has made this prayer to me for above twenty years together. When he was but fifty years old he deſired only that he might live to ſee his ſon ſettled in the world; I granted it. He then begged the ſame favour for his daughter, and afterwards that he might ſee the education of a grandſon. When all this was brought about, he put up a petition that he might live to finiſh a houſe he was building. In ſhort, he is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable old cur, and never wants an excuſe; I will hear no more of him. Upon which he flung down the trap-door in a paſſion, and was reſolved to give no more audiences that day.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the levity of this fable, the moral of it very well deſerves our attention. The vanity of men's wiſhes, which are the natural prayers of the mind, as well as many of thoſe ſecret devotions which they offer up to the Supreme Being, are ſufficiently expoſed by it. Among other reaſons for ſet forms of prayer, I have often thought it a very good one, that by this means the folly and extravagance of men's deſires may be kept within due bounds, and not break out in abſurd and ridiculous petitions on ſo great and ſolemn an occaſion.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Velaſco,</hi> who was no ſtranger to the paſſions of his ſons, and who dreaded every thing from their violence, to prevent conſequences, obliged them by his authority to decide their pretenſions by lots; each previouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging in a ſolemn oath to marry the nymph that ſhould fall to his ſhare.

               </p>
               <p>Soon after the celebration of theſe nuptials, <hi>Velaſco</hi> died, having bequeathed to his eldeſt ſon <hi>Felix,</hi> the houſe wherein he dwelt, together with the greateſt part of his large fortune and effects.</p>
               <p>The huſband of <hi>Proſperity</hi> was ſo tranſported with the gay diſpoſition and enchanting beauties of his bride, that he cloathed her in gold and ſilver, and adorned her with jewels of ineſtimable value. He built a palace for her in the wood; he made rivers in his gardens, and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified their banks with temples and pavilions. He enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at his table the nobles of the land, delighting their ears with muſic, and their eyes with magnificence.

bounded by Economy. In a few years the eſtate of <hi>Felix</hi> was waſted by extravagance, his merchandize failed him by neglect, and his effects were ſeized by the mercileſs hands of creditors. He applied himſelf for ſupport to the nobles and great men, whom he had feaſted and made preſents to: but his voice was as the voice of a ſtranger, and they remembered not his face. The friends whom he had neglected derided him in their turn; his wife alſo inſulted him, and turned her back upon him, and fled. Yet was his heart ſo bewitched with her ſorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that he purſued her with intreaties, till by her haſte to abandon him, her maſk fell off, and diſcovered to him a face as withered and deformed, as before it had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared youthful and engaging.</p>
               <p>What became of him afterwards tradition does not relate with certainty. It is believed that he fled into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Adverſity,</hi> though hateful to his heart, and a ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre to his eyes, was the conſtant attendant upon his ſteps: and, to aggravate his ſorrow, he received certain intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence that his richeſt veſſel was taken by a <hi>Sardinian</hi> pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; that another was loſt upon the <hi>Lybian Syrtes;</hi> and, to complete all, that the banker with whom the greateſt part of his ready money was entruſted, had deſerted his creditors, and retired into <hi>Sicily.</hi> Collecting therefore the ſmall remains of his fortune, he bade adieu to <hi>Tyre;</hi> and, led by <hi>Adverſity,</hi> through unfrequented roads and foreſts overgrown with thickets, he came at laſt to a ſmall village at the foot of a mountain: here they took up their abode ſome time; and <hi>Adverſity,</hi> in return for all the anxiety he had ſuffered, ſoftening the ſeverity of her looks, adminiſtered to him the moſt faithful counſel, weaning his heart from the immoderate love of earthly things, and teaching him to revere the gods, and to place his whole truſt and happineſs in their government and protection. She humanized his ſoul, made him modeſt and humble, taught him to compaſſionate the diſtreſſes of his fellow-creatures, and inclined him to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

"I am ſent, ſaid ſhe, by the gods, to thoſe only whom they love: for I not only train them up by my ſevere diſcipline to future glory, but alſo prepare them to receive with greater reliſh all ſuch moderate enjoyments as are not inconſiſtent with this probationary ſtate.

                  <hi>Uranio</hi> liſtened to her words with great attention; and as he looked earneſtly on her face, the deformity of it ſeemed inſenſibly to decreaſe. By gentle degrees his averſion to her abated; and at laſt he gave himſelf whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly up to her counſel and direction. She would often repeat to him the wiſe maxims of the philoſopher<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "That thoſe who want the feweſt things, approach near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to the gods, who want nothing." She admoniſhed him to turn his eyes to the many thouſands beneath him, inſtead of gazing on the few who live in pomp and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor; and in his addreſſes to the gods, inſtead of ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating for riches and popularity, to pray only for a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous mind, a quiet ſtate, an unblameable life, and a hopeful death.</p>
               <p>Finding him to be every day more and more compoſed, and reſigned, though neither enamoured of her face, nor delighted with her ſociety, ſhe at laſt addreſſed him in the following manner:</p>
               <p>"As the gold is purged and refined from the droſs by the fire, ſo is <hi>Adverſity</hi> ſent by Providence to try and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the virtue of mortals. The end obtained, my taſk is finiſhed; and now I leave you to go and give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my charge.

As ſhe pronounced theſe words, ſhe vaniſhed from his fight. But though her features at that moment, inſtead of inſpiring their uſual horror, ſeemed to diſplay a kind of languiſhing beauty; yet as <hi>Uranio,</hi> in ſpite of his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt efforts, could not prevail on himſelf to love her, he neither regretted her departure, nor wiſhed for her return. But though he rejoiced in her abſence, he treaſured up her counſels in his heart, and grew happy by the practice of them.</p>
               <p>He afterwards be took himſelf again to merchandize; and having in a ſhort time acquired a competency ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for a real enjoyment of life, he retreated to a little farm, which he had bought for that purpoſe, and where he determined to continue the remainder of his days. Here he employed his time in planting, gardening, and husbandry, in quelling all diſorderly paſſions, and in forming his mind by the leſſons of <hi>Adverſity.</hi> He took great delight in a little cell or hermitage in his garden, which ſtood under a tuft of trees, encompaſſed with eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantine and honey-ſuckles. Adjoining it, was a cold bath, formed by a ſpring iſſuing from a rock, and over the door was written in large characters, the following inſcription.</p>

               <p>The converſation of moſt men is diſagreeable, not ſo much for want of wit and learning, as of good-breading and diſcretion.</p>
               <p>If you reſolve to pleaſe, never ſpeak to gratify any particular vanity or paſſion of your own, but always with a deſign either to divert or inform the company. A man who only aims at one of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> whether what he was ſaying could either divert or inform them.</p>
               <p>A modeſt perſon ſeldom fails to gain the good-will of thoſe he converſes with, becauſe no body envies a man who does not appear to be pleaſed with himſelf.</p>
               <p>We ſhould talk extremely little of ourſelves. Indeed what can we ſay? It would be as imprudent to diſcover our faults, as ridiculous to count our fancied virtues. Our private and domeſtic affairs are no leſs improper to be introduced in converſation. What does it concern the company how many horſes you keep in your ſtable? Or whether your ſervant is more knave or fool?</p>
               <p>A man may equally affront the company he is in, by ingroſſing all the talk, or by obſerving a contemptuous ſilence.</p>
               <p>Before you tell a ſtory, it may be generally not amiſs to draw a ſhort character, and give the company a true idea of the principal perſons concerned in it. The beauty of moſt things conſiſts not ſo much in their being ſaid or done, as in their being ſaid or done by ſuch a particular perſon, or on ſuch a particular occaſion.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all the advantages of youth, few young people pleaſe in converſation; the reaſon is, that want of experience makes them poſitive, and what they ſay is rather with a deſign to pleaſe themſelves than any one elſe.</p>
               <p>It is certain that age itſelf will make many things paſs well enough, which would have been laughed at in the mouth of one much younger.</p>
               <p>Nothing however is more inſupportable to men of
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:029518_0096_0FE1CD4B24ED9D00"/>
ſenſe, than an empty formal man, who ſpeaks in proverbs, and decides all controverſies with a ſhort ſentence. This piece of ſtupidity is the more inſufferable, as it puts on the air of wiſdom.</p>
               <p>A prudent man will avoid talking much of any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſcience, for which he is remarkably famous. There is not, methinks, a handſomer thing ſaid of Mr. <hi>Cowley,</hi> in his whole life, than that none but his intimate friends ever diſcovered that he was a great poet by his diſcourſe: beſides the decency of this rule, it is certainly founded on good policy. A man who talks of any thing he is already famous for, has nothing to get, but a great deal to loſe. I might add, that he who is ſometimes ſilent on a ſubject where every one is ſatisfied he could ſpeak well, will often be thought no leſs knowing in other matters, where perhaps he is wholly ignorant.</p>
               <p>Women are frightened at the name of argument, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e ſooner convinced by a happy turn, or a witty expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, than by demonſtration.</p>
               <p>Whenever you commend, add your reaſons for doing ſo; it is this which diſtinguiſhes the approbation of a man of ſenſe from the flattery of ſycophants and the admiration of fools.</p>
               <p>Raillery is no longer agreeable than while the whole company is pleaſed with it. I would leaſt of all be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to except the perſon railed at.</p>
               <p>Though good humour, ſenſe, and diſcretion can ſeldom fail to make a man agreeable, it may be no ill policy ſometimes to prepare yourſelf in a particular manner for converſation, by looking a little farther than your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours into whatever is become a reigning ſubject. If our armies are beſieging a place of importance abroad, or our Houſe of Commons debating a bill of conſequence at home, you can hardly fail of being heard with pleaſure, if you have nicely informed yourſelf of the ſtrength, ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and hiſtory of the former, or of the reaſons for and againſt the latter. It will have the ſame effect, if, when any ſingle perſon begins to make a noiſe in the world, you can learn ſome of the ſmalleſt incidents in his life or converſation; which, though they are too fine for the obſervation of the vulgar, give more ſatisfaction to men of ſenſe, (as they are the beſt openings to a real character) than the recital of his moſt glaring actions. I know but
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:029518_0097_0FE1CD4CC8AE4270"/>
one ill conſequence to be feared from this method, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that coming full charged into company, you ſhould reſolve to unload, whether a handſome opportunity offers itſelf or not.</p>
               <p>Though aſking of queſtions may plead for itſelf the ſpecious name of modeſty, and a deſire of information, it affords little pleaſure to the reſt of the company who may not be troubled with the ſame doubts; beſides which, he who aſks a queſtion would do well to conſider that he lies wholly at the mercy of another before he receives an anſwer.</p>
               <p>Nothing is more ſilly than the pleaſure ſome people take in what they c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll <hi>ſpeaking their minds.</hi> A man of this make will ſay a rude thing for the mere pleaſure of ſaying it, when an oppoſite behaviour, full as innocent, might have preſerved his friend, or made his fortune.</p>
               <p>It is not impoſſible for a man to form to himſelf as exquiſite a pleaſure in complying with the humours and ſentiments of others, as of bringing others over to his own; ſince it is the certain ſign of a ſuperior genius, that it can take and become whatever dreſs it pleaſes.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only add, that beſides what I have here ſaid, there is ſomething which can never be learned but in the company of the polite. The virtues of men are catching as well as their vices; and your own obſervations added to theſe, will ſoon diſcover what it is that commands attention in one man, and makes you tired and diſpleaſed with the diſcourſe of another.</p>

               <p>IN the days of knight-errantry and paganiſm, one of our old <hi>Britiſh</hi> princes ſet up a ſtatue to the goddeſs of Victory, in a point where four roads met together. In her right hand ſhe held a ſpear, and reſted her left upon a ſhield: the outſide of this ſhield was of gold, and the inſide of ſilver. On the former was inſcribed, in the old <hi>Britiſh</hi> language, <hi>To the goddeſs ever favourable;</hi> and on the other, <hi>For four victories obtained ſucceſſively over the</hi> Picts, <hi>and other inhabitants of the Northern Iſlands.</hi>

                  <pb n="193" facs="unknown:029518_0097_0FE1CD4CC8AE4270"/>
It happened one day that two knights completely armed, the one in <hi>black</hi> armour, and the other in <hi>white,</hi> arrived from oppoſite parts of the country at this ſtatue, juſt about the ſame time; and as neither of them had ſeen it before, they ſtopped to read the inſcriptions, and obſerve the excellence of its workmanſhip. After con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating it for ſome time, This <hi>golden</hi> ſhield, ſays the <hi>black</hi> knight—<hi>Golden</hi> ſhield, cried the <hi>White</hi> knight, (who was ſtrictly obſerving the oppoſite ſide) why, if I have my eyes, it is ſilver. I know nothing of your eyes, replied the <hi>black</hi> knight; but if ever I ſaw a <hi>golden</hi> ſhield in my life, this is one: yes, returned the <hi>White</hi> knight ſmiling, it is very probable indeed, that they ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a ſhield of gold in ſo public a place as this: for my part, I wonder even a ſilver one is not too ſtrong a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for the devotion of ſome people that paſs this way; and it appears by the date, that this has been here above three years. The <hi>black</hi> knight could not bear the ſmile with which this was delivered, and grew ſo warm in the diſpute, that it ſoon ended in a challenge; they both therefore turned their horſes, and rode back ſo far as to have ſufficient ſpace for their career, then fixed their ſpears in their reſts, and flew at each other with the greateſt fury and impetuoſity. Their ſhock was ſo rude, and the blow on each ſide ſo effectual, that they both fell to the ground, much wounded and bruiſed and lay there for ſome time, as in a trance. A good <hi>Druid,</hi> who was travelling that way, found them in this condition. The <hi>Druids</hi> were the phyſicians of thoſe times, as well as the <hi>prieſts.</hi> He had a ſovereign balſam about him, which he had compoſed himſelf, for he was very ſkilful in all the plants that grew in the fields, or in the foreſts; he ſtaunched their blood, applied his balſam to their wounds, and brought them as it were from death to life again. As ſoon as they were ſufficiently recovered, he began to inquire into the occaſion of their quarrel. "Why, this man, cried the <hi>black</hi> knight, will have it, that that ſhield yonder is ſilver." "And he will have it, replied the <hi>white</hi> knight, that it is gold;" and then told him all the particulars of the affair. "Ah! ſaid the <hi>Druid,</hi> with a ſigh, you are both of you, my brethren, in the right, and both of you in the wrong: had either of you given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf time to look upon the oppoſite ſide of the ſhield, as

well as that which firſt preſented itſelf to his view, all this paſſion and bloodſhed might have been avoided; however, there is a very good leſſon to be learned from the evils that have befallen you on this occaſion. Permit me therefore to intreat you, by all our gods, and by this goddeſs of victory in particular, <hi>Never to enter into any diſpute for the future, till you have fairly conſidered both ſides of the queſtion."</hi>

               <p>IT is obſervable that <hi>Mahomet,</hi> in a particular manner, forbade gaming and drunkenneſs to his followers, when at the ſame time he indulged them with plurality of women. The laſt of which he looked upon as a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the ſeeds of which are implanted as it were in our nature: whereas gaming and drunkenneſs he abſolutely forbade, as acquired and unnatural vices; as vices pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of the moſt dreadful conſequences. I will not at preſent examine the juſtneſs of the compliment paid to amorous libertiniſm, which he certainly carried too far; but ſhall obſerve, that his ſtrict commands in regard to gaming and drunkenneſs, have contributed more than any of his other injunctions to the happineſs of his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers.</p>
               <p>Gaming (which I ſhall at preſent conſider) ſeems to me of all vices the greateſt enemy of happineſs: its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable attendants are envy, deceit, profuſeneſs, impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and a whole train of diabolical aſſociates. Health, peace of mind, love, family, friends, country, and in ſhort every thing valuable or deſirable, are ſacrificed to it. And to what then are they ſacrificed? Why, to ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice: avarice, the meaneſt of vices. The love of gaming is nothing more than the love of other people's money. It is not the avarice of a miſer; it is the avarice of a thief, a robber; or rather the cowardly avarice of a pick-pocket. It is avarice and profuſion join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together; a moſt unnatural conjunction, and productive of more terrible conſequences than either of them ſingly can poſſibly be: like <hi>Aaron'</hi>s rod, it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbs, it ſwallows up, and contains within itſelf all other vices and may juſtly among vices be ſtiled <hi>Legion;</hi> and
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:029518_0098_0FE1CD5E9A899058"/>
of all baits made uſe of by the grand enemy of mankind, to tempt us from our duty, and make us unhappy here-after, gaming ſeems the moſt dangerous, and the beſt to anſwer his diabolical ends.</p>
               <p>It is ridiculous to hear the votaries of gaming term it an amuſement, an inoffenſive relaxation, . Thoſe who ſo miſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>al it, muſt notwithſtanding allow it to be an irrational, or unimproving diverſion; and that at the beſt it is but murdering time. But upon examination, every obſerver may find, that dallying with the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion draws on imperceptibly to the moſt deſtructive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences. But what ſhall be ſaid of thoſe who take no delight in gaming, yet give into it on almoſt every occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? Surely complaiſance is a poor excuſe for doing a fooliſh or a wicked action, and that every gameſter is a knave or a fool, is a moſt palpable truth. A certain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman, hearing a gentleman ſpoken of, who was ſaid to be a great gameſter: he is a moſt incorrigible blockhead, cries my Lord. But on being aſſured he was a man of very brilliant parts: if ſo, replies my Lord, he muſt be a rank ſcoundrel. Not ſo, my Lord, replies the other, he bears the character of a gentleman of great worth and <hi>honour</hi> "That cannot be, retorts the nobleman; every gameſter is either a <hi>rogue</hi> or <hi>fool, pike</hi> or <hi>gudgeon;</hi> and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our never makes a nearer approach to the heart of ſuch a one than the <hi>tip of his tongue."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All converſation, all improvement, is put a ſtop to the moment gaming commences; friendſhip and ſociety, benevolence and humanity ceaſe, and nothing further is thought of, but the ruin of thoſe you are in company with; the ruin of thoſe you often make the ſtrongeſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations of friendſhip to: the gameſter's happineſs (like the devil's) depends on the miſery of others; and, like Satan too, he ſmiles on thoſe whom in his heart he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votes to deſtruction.</p>
               <p>The life of a gameſter is a life of uncertainty (conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of unhappineſs;) he can never properly call any thing his own, not being aſſured of its poſſeſſion one moment longer than till his next ſitting down to the gaming table. The thriving gameſter, (how precarious is his thriving!) is the worſt of robbers; and the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, the worſt of ſelf-murderers: a murderer who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves all thoſe innocents, who unfortunately have any
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:029518_0099_0FE1CD6036CA5A18"/>
connection with him, in the diſmal gulph of beggery and wretched dependence.</p>
               <p>If covetouſneſs of another's property, and diſcontent with our own, be a breach of the divine command, <hi>"Thou ſhalt not covet thy neighbour's goods, &amp;c."</hi> the game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is ever and ſuperlatively guilty. The late Duke of <hi>A--------e,</hi> who had an averſion to all ſorts of gaming, being urged to no purpoſe by a nobleman to ſport a little money: <hi>Sure, my Lord,</hi> cries the nobleman, <hi>you muſt love your money vaſtly, to be afraid of venturing a trifle of it. It is true, my Lord,</hi> (replies his Grace) <hi>I do love my own money; yet no perſon had ever reaſon to ſay I was fond of another man's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The male part of mankind who give into this vice, proſtitute their talents to the moſt vicious purpoſes; they become entirely abſorbed by it; they ſtand like ſlaves in the market, to be bought and ſold; for neceſſity often glares them in the face, and betrays them to venality.</p>
               <p>If married, how can they reflect on the hazards they put the happineſs of wife, children, friends, . to? And when ill fortune ſtares them in the face, how often are they ſo cowardly as to have recourſe to a piſtol, and by ſuicide leave thoſe innocents to confront a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they themſelves were afraid of facing? But when gaming, ſeizes the female breaſt, to all the above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned miſfortunes we may juſtly add, <hi>loſs of beauty,</hi> which is ever the conſequence of late hours, ruffled paſſions, and a corroding heart. Her honour, her chaſtity, can no longer be called her own, when ſhe commences game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. The manſion of gracefulneſs and beauty is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into a foul and darkſome dungeon. Attracting ſoftneſs and modeſty (the amiable characteriſtics of the ſex) are changed for unbecoming fierceneſs and acerbity of temper, and the whole picture brings to our mind the different ſituation and figure of <hi>Satan</hi> before and after the fall. Theſe reflections (looſe and undigeſted as they are) were occaſioned by the two following relations, which lately happened and which probably ſeveral of my readers know to have but too much truth in them.</p>
               <p>In one of the principal cities in <hi>England</hi> lived <hi>Lucius</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> bleſſed with a moderate fortune. Health, love, peace of mind, and two little darlings, a ſon and daughter. They ſeemed to want for nothing as an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to their happineſs, nor were they inſenſible of
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:029518_0099_0FE1CD6036CA5A18"/>
what they enjoyed; but with gratitude to Heaven, were inſtruments of good to all about them. Towards the cloſe of laſt ſummer, <hi>Lucius</hi> happening to be in company with ſome neighbouring gentleman<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, more in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance to others' taſte than his own. Like other ſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, he met with a variety of fortune, (a variety more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing than a continuance either of good or bad) and warmed with liquor, he was inconſiderately drawn in before the company broke up, to involve himſelf more than his fortune could bear. The next day, on ſober reflection, he could not ſupport the thoughts of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs his folly had brought on his <hi>Sapphira</hi> and the little innocents; he had not courage to acquaint her with what had happened; and whilſt in the midſt of pangs he had hitherto been a ſtranger to, he was viſited again, and again tempted by one of the laſt night's company to try fortune once more. In order to drown reflection, and in hopes of recovering his loſs, he flew to the fatal place, nor did he le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> it till he had loſt his all. The conſequence of which was, that the next day, in deſpair indeſcribeable, after writing to acquaint <hi>Sapphira</hi> with what had happened, he ſhot himſelf through the head; the news of which deprived <hi>Sapphira</hi> of her ſenſes: ſhe is at preſent confined in a mad houſe, and the two little innocents, deſtitute of parents and fortune, have a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome world to ſtruggle through, and are likely to feel all the miſeries that poverty and ſervile dependence en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail on the wretched.</p>
               <p>A young lady who lived in the North, was on the point of marriage with a young gentleman whom ſhe was doat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly fond of, and by whom ſhe was as greatly beloved: ſhe was at the ſame time admired by a perſon of high rank, but whoſe paſſion, as he was already married, was conſequently diſhonourable. He was determined, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, at any rate to indulge his vicious flame; but as ſhe was a perſon of the ſtricteſt honour, he was obliged to act cautiouſly, and keep his love a ſecret. Knowing her propenſity to gaming, he laid a ſnare for her, into which ſhe fell, to the great diminution of her fortune. This he took care to have repreſented with the moſt aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting circumſtances to the gentleman to whom ſhe was engaged. His friends painted to him the dreadful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience

of his taking a gameſter to wife: poverty, diſeaſe, and probably diſhonour to his bed, were the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſequences; in a word, they managed matters ſo as to break off the match. The villain who occaſioned the breach between the lovers, notwithſtanding, miſſed his wicked ends; his addreſſes and propoſals met with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and abhorrence; yet though ſhe preſerved her chaſtity, (a circumſtance very uncommon among female gameſters) the loſs of her intended ſpouſe, whom ſhe was diſtractedly fond of, threw her into a decline, which in a few months put an end to her life.</p>

               <p>THE following is a letter from a father to his only ſon, in which he lays open the deteſtable crime of drunkenneſs, and its ſhocking conſequences, in ſtriking colours. As the ſubject of the letter is a vice not very uncommon in <hi>England,</hi> I hope the inſerting of it will need no further apology.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Tom,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>It is with the greateſt concern I hear you have lately (more than once) been guilty of getting fuddled in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with ſome of your youthful companions; you can ſcarce think what a ſhock this account gave me. I know, my dear boy, you have a great flow of ſpirits, a lively imagination, and great good-nature; but thoſe qualities, inſtead of guarding you againſt that odious fault, are, I am afraid, moſt likely to hurry you into it: other vices generally have their riſe, and take deepeſt root in the meaneſt diſpoſitions. Drunkenneſs on the contrary, is often, too often obſerved to flouriſh in the richeſt and moſt promiſing ſoils: this, <hi>Tom,</hi> is a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal reaſon why I feel for you. A ſocial good-natured youth is drawn in by degrees; if he is lively, ſmart, and witty, his company is ſought for by others; if wit in another captivates him, the company he doats on draws him to the tavern, and though he ſteps cautiouſly at firſt, he ſoon, from habit and example, loſes all ſenſe of what he is doing; the ſenſe of danger daily wears off; fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:029518_0149_0FE2F6B8E07FA808"/>
for company by degrees draws on fondneſs for liquor; he becomes more ſottiſh, and conſequently more ſtupid, till at laſt his underſtanding, (an underſtanding that might have done honour to his country, and benefited his fellow-creatures) becomes clouded and muddled, and inſtead of the promiſing expectations that his youth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded, he becomes a burden to himſelf, and deſpicable to all the world.</p>
                     <p>Drunkenneſs, <hi>Tom,</hi> ſtupifies the ſenſes, deſtroys the memory, blunts the underſtanding, fills men with diſeaſes, and makes them incapable of buſineſs of any kind: that this is the conſequence of habitual drunkenneſs, too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inſtances in every part of this kingdom will evidence. What a deſpicable character that of a ſot is I need not deſcribe to you; and depend upon it, every perſon who is fond of the company of topers, is in a fair way of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a ſot. If your inclination tends that way, check it immediately, nor deceive yourſelf with the hopes of having the power to conquer it whenever you pleaſe; in ſuch a caſe, habit daily adds new ſtrength to the vicious bent: the brute part of us (appetite) ſoon poſſeſſes the whole man, and reaſon, which may be called the angelic part, becomes quite ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>othered and deſtroyed: you know, my lad, it is a common expreſſion to ſay, He is as drunk as a beaſt. We do not ſuppoſe that beaſts get drunk; we mean by it, that man by inebriation drowns his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; and when his reaſon is gone, he is upon a level with, nay really far beneath the brute, irrational creation. Brutes are certainly equally rational with ſuch a wretch, if not more ſo, with the ſuperior advantage of a ſound body, and an inſtinct to guide them.</p>
                     <p>I am not afraid of your giving into vices which flow from an illiberal genius or ſtupidity; as ſwearing, for example, which ſhews a barrenneſs of underſtanding, and a want of words; a want in reality of common ſenſe in the blaſphemer. This, my dear boy, is far from being the caſe with you at preſent; yet ſhould you ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an habitual drunkard, the company you muſt then be often reduced to herd with, and the leſs of your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, will, you may depend upon it, bring on that ſtupid vice as an additional od<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

and then; they think the conſequences innocent and trifling, but they ſoon find themſelves wofully miſtaken. Getting fuddled is the high road to habitual drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the oftener you are guilty of it, the more you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice your health and underſtanding; and the leſs capable you are to guard againſt that abominable vice: it ſteals upon you inſenſibly, and you are ſeldom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of the danger till you are incapable of reſiſting it.</p>
                     <p>Conſider, my dear lad, the firſt deviation from the level paths of virtue, is the gradual imperceptible deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent: the entrance is bewitching, as it lies through the flowery regions of pleaſure; but as you advance, the way ſoon becomes rougher and leſs pleaſing: the proſpect by degrees grows dreary, gloomy, and frightful: each ſtep you advance grows ſteeper and ſteeper; your power of reſiſtence grows fainter and fainter; and you are hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried down, in ſpite of the feeble efforts you are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>A drunkard is the worſt of ſuicides; he is a deliber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, determined ſelf murderer; he hurries himſelf out of the world; and for the ſhort time he crawls on the earth, he makes himſelf miſerable, by loading himſelf with racking diſtempers. Company, which he was ſo fond of, avoid and deſpiſe him, when he can no longer contribute to their irrational mirth, (for you muſt never truſt to friendſhip commenced over a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>You ſeem, <hi>Tom,</hi> to have ſome ambition in you, a laudable ambition, I hope, to diſtinguiſh yourſelf, and cut a figure in the world: all that, my dear boy, is over with you, if you once ſuffer drunkenneſs to become your
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:029518_0100_0FE1CE24ADC1E9B8"/>
maſter: that emulation which might have made you illuſtrious, will of courſe be reverſed into an abaſement that muſt degrade you below rationality; and ſcarce, as I have hinted before, leave you on a level with the loweſt order of groveling brutes.</p>
                     <p>Whenever you hear any perſon brag in company (which drunkards generally do with great pleaſure and ſelf-conſequence) that he got drunk, moſt damnably drunk, ſet that fellow down for a fool at the beſt. It is a fooliſh, nay a wicked way of priding himſelf, of what he ſhould be aſhamed of. What then muſt we think of company, who by their behaviour ſeem to approve ſuch folly; and as to the ridiculous cuſtom of drinking healths, nothing certainly can be a greater enemy to health than that is. I am ſure it were as abſurd to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud a perſon for eating to exceſs, as for drinking to exceſs; they are equally deſpicable, gluttonous, mean, and hoggish.</p>
                     <p>A man may enjoy company infinitely to more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in walking, riding, . than in a tavern over a bottle. Moderate exerciſe contributes to health and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the faculties; and converſation at ſuch times muſt be more edifying from the variety of ſcenes that are continually preſenting themſelves to the eye: or if the weather will not permit that, enjoy yourſelf in your own or your friend's chamber, with an agreeable companion or two, which muſt be much preferable to fuddling in a tavern, or an alehouſe; where the longer you remain, the leſs entertaining and improving muſt the converſation be. Beſides, I know you have a taſte both for muſic and painting, and certainly any perſon ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed can never be at a loſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I am far, <hi>Tom,</hi> from being one of that rigid claſs of mortals, who decay cheerfulneſs and mirth; I love mirth, you know I do: and cheerfulneſs (as the <hi>Spectator</hi> ſays) is the very health of the ſoul; to preſerve which, is one great reaſon why I would have you avoid drinking; for drinking is in reality an enemy to cheerfulneſs, good-nature, and mirth. In drinking, it is hard, nay almoſt impoſſible, to ſtop at a certain mark; and when you once go beyond it, you are hurried you know not whither; quarrelling, ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="202" facs="unknown:029518_0101_0FE1BA2201111DF8"/>
and in regard to converſation, <hi>Tom,</hi> I would appeal to yourſelf, whether, from the little you have ſeen of drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (I ſincerely hope it is but little) whether in your cool moments you would not have been aſhamed of the words and actions which you applauded when warm with liquor: in a word, unleſs you moſt carefully guard againſt drunkenneſs in your youth, it will inſenſibly ſteal on you; it will make you miſerable both in body and mind; it will prove an inſuperable bar to your becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eminent in any profeſſion; it will make you odious to yourſelf, and deſpicable to others; it will afford a perpetual opening for the grand tempter to make you miſerable both here and hereafter; and indeed, and in truth, I would rather hear of your being no more, than your becoming a drunkard. You know I love you, <hi>Tom;</hi> yet the more I love you the more deſirous I would be of your deſcending to the grav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> than to hear of your giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing way to that ſcandalous, mean, deteſtable vice. I ſhall conclude my letter with a little ſtory I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where read, and which I think much to the purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>"A certain young fellow had been drawn into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract with the devil, that in conſideration of ſome impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſervices from his diabolical majeſty, the young fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low was to comply with one of three requeſts the devil ſhould think proper to make him. It is to be obſerved, the devil had before tempted him in vain to commit ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral crimes; but the young fellow had hitherto with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood his temptations, and was ſtill determined to refuſe him in every thing but the one requeſt he was obliged by his contract to comply with: when it came to <hi>Beelzebub's</hi> turn to command, he left it to the youth's choice, either to murder his father, debauch his own ſiſter, or get drunk. The young man choſe the laſt, as by far the leaſt ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but when he had got drunk, the devil took that opportunity of tempting him (which till he was drunk he never could effectually do) to commit both the other crimes. Thus he was drawn in to commit all the devil wanted; whereas if either of the other had been his choice, he would probably have eſcaped ſo complicated guilt."</p>

               <p>THERE was formerly a <hi>Santon,</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Barſiſa,</hi> who, for the ſpace of an hundred years, very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently applied himſelf to prayer; and ſcarce ever went out of the grotto in which he made his reſidence, for fear of expoſing himſelf to the danger of offending God. He faſted in the day time, and watched in the night; all the inhabitants of the country had ſo great a veneration for him, and ſo highly valued his prayers, that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly applied to him when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hey had any favours to beg of heaven. When he made vows for the health of a ſick perſon, the patient was immediately cured.</p>
               <p>It happened that the daughter of the king of that country fell into a dangerous diſtemper, the cauſe of which the phyſicians could not diſcover, yet they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued preſcribing remedies by gueſs; but inſtead of helping the Princeſs, they only augmented her diſeaſe. In the mean time, the King was inconſolable, for he paſſionately loved his daughter: wherefore one day, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all human aſſiſtance vain, he declared it as his opinion, that the Princeſs ought to be ſent to the <hi>Santon Barſiſa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the <hi>Beys</hi> applauded his ſentiment, and the King's officers conducted her to to the <hi>Santon;</hi> who, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his frozen age, could not ſee ſuch a beauty, without being ſenſibly moved. He gazed on her with pleaſure; and the devil taking this opportunity, whiſpered in his ears thus "Oh, <hi>Santon!</hi> do not let ſlip ſuch a fortunate minute: tell the King's ſervants, that it is requiſite for the Princeſs to paſs this night in the grotto, to ſee whether it will pleaſe God to cure her; that you will put up a prayer for her, and that they need only come to fetch her to-morrow.</p>
               <p>How weak is man! the <hi>Santon</hi> followed the devil's advice, and did what he ſuggeſted to him. But the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, before they would yield to leave the Princeſs, ſent one of their number to know the King's pleaſure. That
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:029518_0102_0FE1CD61D92A2B50"/>
monarch, who had an entire confidence in <hi>Barſiſa,</hi> never in the leaſt ſcrupled the truſting of his daughter with him. <hi>I conſent, ſaid he, that ſhe ſtay with that holy man, and that he keep her as long as he pleaſes: I am wholly ſatisfied on that head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the officers had received the King's anſwer, they retired, and the Princeſs remained alone with the Hermit. Night being come, the devil preſented himſelf to the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> ſaying, "Canſt thou let ſlip ſo favourable an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity with ſo charming a creature? Fear not her telling of the violence you offer to her; if ſhe were even ſo indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet as to reveal it, who will believe her? The court, the city, and all the world are too much prepoſſeſſed in thy favour, to give any credit to ſuch a report. You may do any thing unpuniſhed, when armed by the great reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for wiſdom which you have acquired." The unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate <hi>Barſiſa</hi> was ſo weak as to hearken to the enemy of mankind. He approached the Princeſs, took her into his arms, and in a moment cancelled a virtue of an hundred years duration.</p>
               <p>He had no ſooner perpetrated the crime, than a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand avenging horrors haunted him night and day. He thus accoſted the devil: "Oh wretch, ſays he, it is thou who haſt deſtroyed me! thou haſt encompaſſed me for a whole age, and endeavoured to ſeduce me; and now thou haſt at laſt gained thy end." "Oh. <hi>Santon!</hi> anſwered the devil, do not repro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch me with the pleaſures thou haſt enjoyed. Thou mayeſt repent: but what is unhappy for thee is, that the Princeſs is impregnate, and thy ſin will become public: thou wilt become the laughing-ſtock of thoſe who admire and reverence thee at preſent, and the King will put thee to an ignominious death."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Barſiſa,</hi> terrified by this diſcourſe, ſays to the devil, "What ſhall I do to prevent the publication of my ſhame?" "To hinder the knowledge of your crime, you ought to commit a freſh one, anſwered the devil. Kill the Princeſs, bury her in a corner of the grotto, and when the King's meſſengers come to-morrow, tell them you have cured her, and that ſhe went from the grotto very early in the morning: they will believe you, and ſearch for her all over the city and country; and the King her father will be in great pain for her; but after ſeveral vain ſearches, it will wear off."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="205" facs="unknown:029518_0102_0FE1CD61D92A2B50"/>
The Hermit, abandoned by God, purſuant to this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; killed the Princeſs, buried her in a corner of the grotto, and the next day told the officers what the devil bade him ſay. They made diligent inquiry for the King's daughter; but not being able to hear of her, they deſpaired of finding her, when the devil told them that all their ſearches for the Princeſs were in vain; and relating what had paſſed betwixt her and the <hi>Santon,</hi> he told them the place where ſhe was interred. The officers immediately went to the grotto, ſeized <hi>Barſiſa,</hi> and found the Princeſs's body in the place to which the devil had directed them; whereupon they took up the corpſe, and carried it and the <hi>Santon</hi> to the palace.</p>
               <p>When the King ſaw his daughter dead, and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the whole event, he broke out into tears and bitter lamentations; and aſſembling the doctors, he laid the <hi>Santon's</hi> crime before them, and aſked their advice how he ſhould be puniſhed. All the doctors condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to death; upon which the gibbet was erected. When the Hermit went up the ladder, and was going to be turned off, the devil whiſpered in his ear theſe words, O <hi>Santon!</hi> if you will worſhip me, I will extricate you out of this difficulty, and tranſport you two thouſand leagues from hence, into a country where you ſhall be reverenced by men, as much as you were before this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture." "I am content, ſays <hi>Barſiſa;</hi> deliver me, and I will worſhip thee." "Give me firſt a ſign of adoration," replied the devil; whereupon the <hi>Santon</hi> bowed his head, and ſaid, "I give myſelf to you." Then the devil raiſing his voice, ſaid, "O, <hi>Barſiſa,</hi> I am ſatisfied; I have obtained what I deſired:" and with theſe words, ſpitting in his face, he diſappeared; and the deluded <hi>Santon</hi> was hanged.</p>
               <p>From this may be inferred, that evil thoughts will ſometimes ſtart up even in the beſt of minds, which, when checked as ſoon as noticed, can never be deemed crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inal, but ought to be carefully ſtified in <hi>embrio,</hi> as the firſt incitements to ſin; for vice naturally begets vice, and the leaſt digreſſion from virtue is frequently ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſuch a train of evils, as leads on imperceptibly to certain ruin.</p>

               <p>The angel of death cloſed the eyes of the Sultan <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din,</hi> my father, and his empire deſcended to me in the eighteenth year of my age. At firſt my mind was awed to humility, and ſoftened with grief; I was inſenſible to the ſplendor of dominion; I heard the addreſſes of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery with diſguſt, and received the homage of dependent greatneſs with indifference. I had always regarded my father, not only with love, but reverence; and I was now perpetually recollecting inſtances of his tenderneſs, and reviewing the ſolemn ſcene, in which he recommended me to heaven in imperfect language, and graſped my hand in the agonies of death.</p>
               <p>One evening, after having concealed myſelf all day in my chamber, I viſited his grave: I proſtrated myſelf on his tomb; ſorrow overflowed my eyes, and devotion kindled in my boſom. I felt myſelf, ſuddenly ſmitten on the ſhoulder as with a rod; and looking up, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a man whoſe eyes were piercing as light, and his beard whiter than ſnow. "I am, ſaid he, the Genius <hi>Syndarac,</hi> the friend of thy father <hi>Abradin,</hi> who was the fear of his enemies, and the deſire of his people; whoſe ſmile diffuſed gladneſs like the luſtre of the morning,
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:029518_0103_0FE1CD6376303140"/>
and whoſe frown was dreadful as the gathering of a tempeſt: reſign thyſelf to my influence, and thou ſhalt be like him." I bowed myſelf to the earth in token of gratitude and obedience, and he put a ring on the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle finger of my left hand, in which I perceived a ruby of a deep colour and uncommon brightneſs. "This ring, ſaid he, ſhall mark out to thee the boundaries of good and evil; that, without weighing remote conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, thou mayeſt know the nature and tendency of every action. Be attentive therefore to the ſilent admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition; and when the circle of gold ſhall, by a ſudden contraction, preſs thy finger, and the ruby ſhall grow pale, deſiſt immediately from what thou ſhalt be doing, and mark down that action in thy memory as a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the rule of right: keep my gift as a pledge of happineſs and honour, and take it not off for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment." I received the ring with a ſenſe of obligation which I ſtrove to expreſs, and an aſtoniſhment that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled me to be ſilent. The <hi>Genius</hi> perceived my confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and turning from me with a ſmile of complacency, immediately diſappeared.</p>
               <p>During the firſt moon I was ſo cautious and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that the pleaſure of reflecting that my ring had not once indicated a fault, was leſſened by a doubt of its virtue. I applied myſelf to the public buſineſs. My melancholy decreaſed, as my mind was diverted to other objects; and, leſt the youth of my court ſhould think that recreation was too long ſuſpended, I appointed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eat the lion. But though I went out to the ſport to gratify others rather than myſelf, yet my uſual ardour returned in the field; I grew warm in the purſuit, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the chace, which was unſucceſsful, too long, and returned fatigued and diſappointed.</p>
               <p>As I entered the ſeraglio, I was met by a little dog that had been my father's, who expreſſed his joy at my return by jumping round me, and endeavouring to reach my hand: but as I was not diſpoſed to receive his careſſes, I ſtruck him, in the fretfulneſs of my diſpleaſure, ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere a blow with my foot, that it left him ſcarce power to crawl away, and hide himſelf under a ſofa in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the apartment. At this moment I felt the ring preſs my finger, and looking upon the ruby, I perceived the glow of its colour abated.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="208" facs="unknown:029518_0104_0FE1CD6F1B1AFAE8"/>
I was at firſt ſtruck with ſurpriſe and regret; but ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe and regret quickly gave way to diſdain. "Shall not the Sultan <hi>Amurath,</hi> ſaid I, to whom a thouſand kings pay tribute, and in whoſe hand is the life of nations, ſhall not <hi>Amurath</hi> ſtrike a dog that offends him, without being reproached for having tranſgreſſed the rule of right?" My ring again preſſed my finger, and the ruby became more pale: immediately the palace ſhock with a burſt of thunder, and the Genius <hi>Syndarac</hi> again ſtood before me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>"Amurath,</hi> ſaid he, thou haſt offended againſt thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the duſt; a being who, like thee, has received from the ALMIGHTY a capacity of pleaſure and pain: pleaſure which caprice is not allowed to ſuſpend, and pain which juſtice only has a right to inflict. If thou art juſtified by power in afflicting inferior beings, I ſhould be juſtified in afflicting thee: but my power yet ſpares thee, becauſe it is directed by the laws of ſovereign good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and becauſe thou mayeſt yet be reclaimed by admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition. But yield not to the impulſe of quick reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor indulge in cruelty the forwardneſs of diſguſt, leſt by the laws of goodneſs I be compelled to afflict thee; for he that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> reproof, muſt be reformed by puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or loſt for ever."</p>
               <p>At the preſence of <hi>Syndarac</hi> I was troubled, and his words covered me with confuſion: I fell proſtrate at his feet, and heard him pronounce with a milder accent, "Expect not henceforth that I ſhould anſwer the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of arrogance, or gratify the curioſity of ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; confide in my friendſhip, and truſt implicitly to thy ring."</p>
               <p>As the chace had produced ſo much infelicity, I did not repeat it, but invited my nobles to a banquet, and entertained them with dancing and muſic. I had given leave that all ceremony ſhould be ſuſpended, and that the company ſhould treat me, not as a ſovereign, but an equal, becauſe the converſation would otherwiſe be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbered or reſtrained; and I encouraged others to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantry, by indulging the luxuriancy of my own imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. But though I affected to throw off the trappings of royalty, I had not ſufficient magnanimity to deſpiſe them. I enjoyed the voluntary deference which was paid me, and was ſecretly offended at <hi>Alibeg,</hi> my viſier,
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:029518_0104_0FE1CD6F1B1AFAE8"/>
who endeavoured to prevail upon the aſſembly to enjoy the liberty that had been given them, and was himſelf an example of the conduct that he recommended. I ſingled out as the object of my raillery the man who alone deſerved my approbation: he believed my conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion to be ſincere, and imagined that he was ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my favour by that behaviour which incurred my diſpleaſure; he was, therefore, grieved and confounded to perceive that I laboured to render him ridiculous and contemptible: I enjoyed his pain, and was elated at my ſucceſs; but my attention was ſuddenly called to my ring, and I perceived the ruby change colour. I deſiſted for a moment; but ſome of my courtiers having diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered and ſeconded my intention, I felt my vanity and reſentment gratified; I endeavoured to waſh away the remembrance of my ring with wine; my ſatire became more bitter, and <hi>Alibeg</hi> diſcovered yet greater diſtreſs. My ring again reproached me; but I ſtill perſevered. The viſier was at length rouſed to his defence; probably he had diſcovered and deſpiſed my weakneſs: his replies were ſo poignant, that I became outrageous, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from raillery to invectives: at length, diſguiſing the anguiſh of his mind with a ſmile, "<hi>Amurath,</hi> ſaid he, If the <hi>Sultan</hi> ſhould know, that after having invited your friends to feſtivity and merriment, you had aſſumed this authority, and inſulted thoſe who were not aware that you diſdained to be treated with the familiarity of friendſhip, you would certainly fall under his diſpleaſure." The ſeverity of this ſarcaſm, which was extorted by long pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ocations from a man warmed with wine, ſtung me with intolerable rage: I ſtarted up, and ſpurning him from the table, was about to draw my poignard; when my at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was again called to my ring, and I perceived with ſome degree of regret, that the ruby had fallen almoſt to a perfect white.</p>
               <p>But inſtead of being reſolved to be more watchful againſt whatever might bring me under the ſilent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, I comforted myſelf, that the <hi>Genius</hi> would no more alarm me with his preſence. The irregularities of my conduct increaſed almoſt imperceptibly, and the intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of my ring became proportionably more frequent, though leſs forcible; till at laſt they were ſo familiar, that I ſcarce remarked when they were given and when ſuſpended.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="210" facs="unknown:029518_0105_0FE1CD71E674A290"/>
It was ſoon diſcovered that I was pleaſed with ſervility; ſervility therefore was practiſed, and I rewarded it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with a penſion, and ſometimes with a place. Thus the government of my kingdom was left to petty tyrants, who oppreſſed the people to enrich themſelves. In the mean time I filled my ſeraglio with women, among whom I abandoned myſelf to ſenſuality, without enjoying the pure delight of that love which ariſes from eſteem. But I had not yet ſtained my hands with blood, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>My reſentment againſt <hi>Alibeg,</hi> however unjuſt, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible, and terminated in the moſt perfect hatred. I degraded him from his office; but I ſtill kept him at court, that I might embitter his life by perpetual indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and practiſe againſt him new ſchem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Selima,</hi> the daughter of this Prince, had been intended by my father for my wife, and the marriage had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed only by his death: but the pleaſure and the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity that <hi>Alibeg</hi> would derive from this alliance had now changed with my purpoſe. Yet ſuch was the beauty of <hi>Selima,</hi> that I gazed with deſire; and ſuch was her wit, that I liſtened with delight. I therefore reſolved, that I would, if poſſible, ſeduce her to voluntary proſtitution; and that when her beauty ſhould yield to the charms of variety, I would diſmiſs her with marks of diſgrace. But in this attempt I could not ſucceed; my ſolicitations were rejected ſometimes with tears, and ſometimes with reproaches. I became every day more wretched, by ſeeking to bring calamities upon others; I conſidered my diſappointment as the triumph of a ſlave, whom I wiſhed, but did not dare to deſtroy; and I regarded his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as the inſtrument of my diſhonour. Thus the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, which before had ſhaken my purpoſe, was weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened; my deſire for beauty became <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>She reſided by my command in an apartment of the ſeraglio, and I entered her chamber at midnight by a private door, of which I had the key; but with inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible vexation I found it empty. To be thus diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed

They ran in pale and trembling; I demanded the lady; they gazed at me aſtoniſhed and terrified, and then looking upon each other, ſtood ſilent: I repeated my demand with fury and execration, and to enforce it, called aloud for the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters of death: they then fell proſtrate at my feet, and declared with one voice that they knew not where ſhe was; that they had left her, when they were diſmiſſed for the night, ſitting on a ſofa, penſive and alone; and that no perſon had ſince, to their knowledge, paſſed in or out of her apartment.</p>

               <p>IN this account, however incredible, they perſiſted without variation; and having filled the palace with alarm and confuſion, I was obliged to retire, without gaining any intelligence by what means I had been baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled, or on whom to turn my reſentment. I reviewed the tranſactions of the night with anguiſh and regret, and bewildered myſelf among the innumerable poſſibilities that might have produced my diſappointment. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered that the windows of <hi>Selima's</hi> apartments were open, and I imagined that ſhe might that way have eſcaped into the gardens of the ſeraglio. But why ſhould ſhe eſcape who had never been confined? If ſhe had deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to departed, ſhe might have departed by day. Had ſhe an aſſignation? And did ſhe intend to return, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being known to have been abſent?

               <p>My ring, which during this ſeries of events had given perpetual intimation of guilt, and which was always diſregarded, now preſſed my finger ſo forcibly, that it gave me great pain, and compelled my notice. I imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately retired, and gave way to the diſcontent that ſwelled my boſom. "How wretched a ſlave is <hi>Amurath</hi> to an inviſible tyrant! a being, whoſe malevolence or envy has reſtrained me in the exerciſe of my authority as a Prince, and whoſe cunning has contrived perpetually to inſult me, by intimating that every action of my life is a crime! how long ſhall I groan under this intolerable oppreſſion? This accurſed ring is the badge and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of my ſubjection and diſhonour: he who gave it, is now perhaps in ſome remote region of the air; perhaps he rolls ſome planet in its orbit, agitates the ſouthern ocean with a tempeſt, or ſhakes ſome diſtant region with an earthquake: but wherever he is, he has ſurely a more important employ than to watch my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. Perhaps he has contrived this taliſman, only to reſtrain me from the enjoyment of ſome good, which he wiſhes to withhold; I feel that my deſires are controuled; and to gratify theſe deſires is to be happy." As I pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="5 letters">
                     <desc>•••••</desc>
                  </gap>ed theſe words I drew off the ring, and threw it to the ground with diſdain and indignation: immediately the air grew dark; a cloud burſt in thunder over my head, and the eye of <hi>Syndarac</hi> was upon me. I ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him motionleſs and ſilent: horror thrilled in my
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:029518_0106_0FE1CD73897EF820"/>
veins, and my hair ſtood upright. I had neither power to deprecate his anger, nor to confeſs my faults. In his countenance there was a calm ſerenity; and I heard him pronounce theſe words: "thou haſt now, as far as is in thy own power, thrown off humanity, and degraded thy being; thy form therefore ſhall no longer conceal thy nature. nor thy example render thy vices contagious." He then touched me with his rod; and while the ſound of his voice yet vibrated in my ears, I found myſelf in the midſt of a deſart, not in the form of a man, but of a monſter, with the ſore parts of my body like a wolf, and the hinder parts like a goat. I was ſtill conſcious to every event of my life, and my intellectual powers were continued, though my paſſions were irritated to frenzy. I now rolled in the ſand in an agony not to be deſcribed; and now haſtily traverſed the deſart, impelled only by the vain deſire of flying from myſelf: I now bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with rage, and now howled in deſpair; this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I breathed execrations againſt the <hi>Genius,</hi> and the next reproached myſelf for having forfeited his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
               <p>By this violent agitation of mind and body, the powers of both were ſoon exhauſted: I crawled into a den which I perceived near me, and immediately ſunk down in a ſtate of inſenſibility. I ſlept; but ſleep, inſtead of prolong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, put an end to this interval of quiet. The <hi>Genius</hi> ſtill terrified me with his preſence; I heard his ſentence repeated, and felt again all the horrors of my transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. When I awaked, I was not refreſhed: calamity, though it compelled me to admit ſlumber, yet could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude feſt. But I was now rouſed with hunger; for hunger, like ſleep, is irreſiſtible.</p>
               <p>I went out in ſearch of prey; and if I felt any allevia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of miſery, beſides the hope of ſatisfying my appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, it was in the thought of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But while I was thus meditating the deſtruction of others, I trembled, left by ſome ſtronger ſavage I ſhould be deſtroyed myſelf.</p>

In the midſt of this variety of torment I heard the cry of dogs, the trampling of horſes, and the ſhouts of the hunters, and ſuch is the love of life, however wretched, that my heart ſunk within me at the ſound. To hide my, ſelf was impoſſible, and I was too much enfeebled either to fly or reſiſt. I ſtood ſtill till they came up. At firſt they gazed at me with wonder, and doubted whether they ſhould advance; but at length a ſlave threw a net over me, and I was dragged to the city.</p>
               <p>I now entered the metropolis of my empire, amidſt the noiſe and tumult of the rabble, who the day before would have hid themſelves at my preſence. I heard the ſound of muſic at a diſtance; the heralds approached and <hi>Alibe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> was proclaimed in my ſtead. I was now deſerted by the multitude, whoſe curioſity was diverted by the pomp of the proceſſion; and was conducted to the place where other ſavages are kept, which cuſtom has conſidered as part of the regalia.</p>
               <p>My keeper was a black ſlave, whom I did not remember ever to have ſeen, in whom it would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> given me food, and the vigour of nature was reſtored, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> covered in me ſuch tokens of ferocity, that he ſuffered me to faſt many hours before I was again fed. I was ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged at this delay, that, forgetting my dependence, I roared horribly when he again approached me; ſo that he found it neceſſary to add blows to hunger, that he might gain ſuch an aſcendency over me as was, ſuitable to his office. By this ſlave, I was alternately beaten and famiſhed, till the fierceneſs of my diſpoſition being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by fear and langour, a mild temper inſenſibly ſtole upon me and a demeanor that was begun by conſtraint was continued by habit.</p>
               <p>I was now treated with leſs ſeverity, and ſtrove to expreſs ſomething like gratitude, that might encourage my keeper to yet greater kindneſs. His vanity was flattered by my ſubmiſſion; and, to ſhew as well his courage as the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of his diſcipline, he ventured ſometimes to careſs me in the preſence of thoſe whoſe curioſity brought them to ſee me. A kind of friendſhip thus imperceptibly grew between us, and I felt ſome degree of the affection I had feigned. It happened that a tyger which had been lately <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

giving me my proviſion, and leaping upon him, would inſtantly have torn him to pieces, if I had not ſeized the ſavage by the throat, and dragged him to the ground: the ſlave inſtantly diſpatched him with his dagger, and turned about to careſs his deliverer; but ſtarting ſuddenly backward, he ſtood motionleſs with aſtoniſhment, perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I was no longer a monſter, but a dog.</p>
               <p>I was myſelf conſcious of the change which had again paſſed upon me, and leaping out of my den, eſcaped from my confinement. This transformation I conſidered as a reward for my fidelity, and was perhaps never more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py than in the firſt moments of my eſcape; for I reflected, that as a dog, my liberty was not only reſtored, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> I was no longer ſuſpected of qualities which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered me unfit for ſociety; I had ſome faint reſemblance of human virtue, which is not found in other animals, and therefore hoped to be more generally careſſed. But it was not long before this joy ſubſided in the remembrance of that dignity from which I had fallen, and from which I was ſtill at an immeaſurable diſtance. Yet I lifted up my heart in gratitude to the power who had once more brought me within the circle of nature. As a brute, I was more thankful for a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

               <p>As ſoon as the firſt tumult of my mind was paſt, I felt an irreſiſtible inclination once more to viſit the apartments of my ſeraglio. I placed myſelf behind an emir, whom I knew to have been the friend of <hi>Alibeg,</hi> and was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to follow him into the preſence. The perſons and the place, the retroſpection of my life which they produced, and the compariſon of what I was with what I had been, almoſt over whelmed me. I went unobſerved into the garden, and lay down under the ſhade of an almond-tree, that I might indulge thoſe reflections which, though they oppreſſed me with melancholy, I did not wiſh to loſe.</p>
               <p>I had not been long in this place before a little dog, which I knew to be the ſame I had ſpurned from me when he careſſed me at my return from hunting, came and fawned at my feet. My heart ſmote me, and I ſaid to myſelf, "Doſt thou know me under this diſguiſe? Is thy fidelity to thy Lord unſhaken? Cut off as I am from

the converſe of mankind, haſt thou preſerved for me an affection, which I once ſo ſlightly eſteemed, and requited with evil? This forgetfulneſs of injury, and this ſteady friendſhip, are they leſs than human, or are they more?" I was not prevented by theſe reflections from returning thoſe careſſes that I received; and <hi>Alibeg,</hi> who juſt entered the garden, took notice of me, and ordered that I ſhould not be turned out.</p>
               <p>In the ſeraglio, I ſoon learned, that a body which was thought to be mine was found dead in the chamber; and that <hi>Alibeg</hi> had been choſen to ſucceed me, by the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous voice of the people. But I gained no intelligence of <hi>Selima,</hi> whoſe apartment I found in the poſſeſſion of another, and for whom I had ſearched every part of the palace in vain. I became reſtleſs; every place was irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; a deſire to wander prevailed; and one evening I wont out at the garden-gate, and travelling till midnight, I lay down at the foot of a ſycamore tree and ſlept.</p>
               <p>In the morning, I beheld with ſurpriſe a wall of marble that ſeemed to reach to heaven, and gates that were ſculptured with every emblem of delight. Over the gate was inſcribed in letters of gold, "Within this wall liberty is unbounded, and felicity complete: nature is not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the tyranny of religion, nor is pleaſure awed by the frown of virtue The gate is obedient to thy wiſh, whoſoever thou art: enter therefore, and be happy."</p>
               <p>When I read this inſcription, my boſom throbbed with tumultuous expectation: but my deſire to enter was repreſſed by the reflection that I had loſt the form in which alone I could gratify the appetites of a man. Deſire and curioſity were notwithſtanding predominants, The door immediately opened inward: I entered, and it cloſed after me.</p>

               <p>BUT my ears were now ſtunned with the diſſonance of riot, and my eyes ſickened at the contortions of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery: diſeaſe was viſible in every countenance, however

impreſſed with the character of rage, of drunkenneſs, or of luſt; rape and murder, revelling and ſtrife, filled every ſtreet and every dwelling.</p>
               <p>As my retreat was cut off, I went forward with timidity and circumſpection; for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> imagined that I could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe eſcape injury, than by eluding the notice of wretches whoſe propenſity to ill was reſtrained by no law; and I perceived too late, that to puniſh vice is to promote hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
               <p>It was now evening; and that I might paſs the night in greater ſecurity. I quitted the public way; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a houſe that was incircled by a moat, I ſwam over to it, and choſe an obſcure corner of the area for my aſylum. I heard from within, the ſound of dancing and muſic; but after a ſhort interval, was alarmed with the menaces of rage, the ſhrieks of terror, and the wail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of diſtreſs. The window of the banquetting room flew open, and ſome veniſon was thrown out which fell juſt at my feet. As I had eaten nothing ſince my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the ſeraglio, I regarded this as a fortunate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident: and after the pleaſure of an unexpected repaſt, I again lay down in expectation of the morning, with hope and fear: but in a ſhort time many perſons ruſhed from the houſe with lights, and ſeemed ſolicitons to gather up the veniſon which had been thrown out; but not being able to find it, and at the ſame time perceiving me, they judged I had devoured it. I was immediately ſeized, and led into the houſe: but as I could not diſcover that I was the object either of malignity or kindneſs, I was in a doubt what would be the iſſue of the event. It was not long before this doubt was ſolved; for I ſoon learned from the diſcourſe of thoſe about me, that I was ſuſpected to have eaten poiſon which had been intended for another, and was ſecured, that the effect might either remove or confirm the ſuſpicion. As it was not expected that the poiſon would immediately operate. I was locked up in a room by myſelf, where I reflected upon the cauſe and event of my confinement with inexpreſſible anguiſh, anxiety, and terror.</p>

ſaid he, and the angel of death ſhall teach thee, that the wants of nature cannot be ſupplied with ſafety, where the inordinate appetites of vice are not reſtrained. Thy hunger required food; but the luſt and revenge of others have given thee poiſon." My blood grew chill as he ſpoke, I diſcovered and abhorred my folly: but while I wiſhed to expreſs my contrition, I fell down in an agony; my eyes failed me, I ſhivered, was convulſed, and expired.</p>
               <p>That ſpark of immaterial fire, which no violence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

On this new ſtate of exiſtence I entered with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible delight: I imagined that my wings were not only a pledge of ſafety, but of the favour of <hi>Syndarac</hi> whom I was now more than ever ſolicitous to pleaſe. I flew immediately from the window, and turning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the wall through which I entered, I endeavoured to riſe above it, that I might quit for ever a place in which guilt and wretchedneſs were complicated in every object, and which I now deteſted as much as before I had deſired. But over this region a ſulphurous vapour hovered like a thick cloud, which I no ſooner entered than I fell down panting for breath, and had ſcarce ſtrength to keep my wings ſufficiently extended to break my fall. It was now midnight, and I alighted near the mouth of a cave, in which I thought there appeared ſome faint glimmerings of light. Into this place I entered without much appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion: as it rather appeared to be the retreat of pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itence, than the receſs of luxury: but leſt the noiſe of my wings ſhould diſcover me to any hateful or miſchiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inhabitant of this gloomy ſolitude, I entered in ſilence, and upon my feet. As I went forward the cave grew wider; and by the light of a lamp which was ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended from the roof, I diſcovered a Hermit liſtening to a young lady, who ſeemed to be greatly affected with the events which ſhe was relating. Of the Hermit I had no knowledge; but the lady I diſcerned to be <hi>Selima.</hi> I was ſtruck with amazement at this diſcovery; I remembered with the deepeſt contrition my attempts upon her virtue, and I now ſecretly rejoiced that ſhe had rendered them ineffectual: I watched her lips with the utmoſt impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of curioſity, and ſhe continued her narrative thus.</p>
               <p>"I was ſitting on a ſofa one evening, after I had been

                  </gap>y. I deſcended, the cloud diſſipated, and I found my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſitting in an alcove, by the ſide of a canal that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circled a ſtately edifice and a ſpacious garden. I ſaw many perſons paſs along; but diſcovered in all either ſomething diſſolute or wretched, ſomething that alarmed my fear, or excited my pity. I ſuddenly perceived ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men with their ſwords drawn, contending for a woman, who was forced almoſt irreſiſtibly by the crowd, which moved directly towards the place in which I was ſitting. I was terrified, and looked round me with eagerneſs to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> where I could retreat for ſafety. A perſon richly dreſſed perceived my diſtreſs, and invited me into the houſe, which the canal ſurrounded. This invitation I haſtily accepted with gratitude and joy; but I ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked ſeveral incidents which filled me with now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity and apprehenſion. I was welcomed to a place in which infamy and honour were equally unknown; where every wiſh was indulged without the violation of my law, and where the will was therefore determined only by appetite. I was preſently ſurrounded by women, whoſe behaviour covered me with bluſhes; and though I rejected the careſſes of the perſon into whoſe power I was delivered, yet they became jealous of the diſtinction with which he treated me. My expoſtulations were not heard, and my tears were treated with merriment: prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were made for revelling and jollity: I was invited to join the dance, and upon my refuſal was entertained with muſic. In this dreadful ſituation, I ſighed thus to myſelf: how ſevere is that juſtice which tranſports thoſe who form licentious wiſhes, to a ſociety in which they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

friends of <hi>virtue</hi> are mighty; reject not their protection, and thou art ſafe. "As I renounced the preſumptuous wiſh which had once polluted my mind, I exulted in this intimation with aſſurances of relief; and when ſupper was ſet before me, I ſuffered the principal lady to ſerve me with ſome veniſon; but the friendly voice having warned me that it was poiſoned, I fell back in my ſeat, and turned pale: the lady inquired earneſtly what had diſordered me; but inſtead of making a reply, I threw the veniſon from the window, and declared that ſhe had intended my death. The maſter of the table, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that the lady to whom I ſpoke changed counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, was at once convinced that ſhe had indeed at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to poiſon me, to preſerve that intereſt which as a rival ſhe feared I ſhould ſubvert. He roſe up in a rage, and commanded the veniſon to be produced: a dog that was ſuppoſed to have eaten it was brought in; but before the event could be known the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>"In the midſt of this confuſion I found means to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, and wandered through the city in ſearch of ſome obſcure receſs, where, if I received not the aſſiſtance which I hoped, death at laſt might ſecure my perſon from violence, and cloſe mine eyes on thoſe ſcenes which, wherever I turned, filled me not only with diſguſt, but with horror.

               <p>I gazed upon <hi>Selima,</hi> while I thus learned the ardour of that affection which I had abuſed, with ſentiments that can never be conceived but when they are felt. I was touched with the moſt bitter remorſe, for having produced one wiſh that could ſtain ſo amiable a mind; and abhorred myſelf for having uſed the power which I derived from her tenderneſs, to effect her deſtruction.

<pb n="222" facs="unknown:029518_0111_0FE1CD98A9414780"/>
after having waſhed myſelf, and offered up my morning devotions, I aſcended the high hills of <hi>Bagdad,</hi> in order to paſs the reſt of the day in meditation and prayer. As I was there airing myſelf on the top of the mountains, I fell into a profound contemplation on the vanity of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man life; and paſſing from one thought to another, Surely, ſaid I, man is but a ſhadow, and life a dream. Whilſt I was thus muſing, I caſt my eye towards the ſummit of a rock that was not far from me, where I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered one in the habit of a ſhepherd, with a muſical inſtrument in his hand. As I looked upon him, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied it to his lips, and began to play upon it. The ſound of it was exceeding ſweet, and wrought into a vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of tones that were inexpreſſibly melodious, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether different from any thing I had ever heard. This put me in mind of thoſe heav'nly airs that are played to the departed ſouls of good men upon their firſt arrival in Paradiſe, to wear out the impreſſions of their agonies, and to qualify them for the pleaſures of that happy play. My heart melted away in ſecret rapture.</p>
               <p>I had often been told that the rock before me was the haunt of a Genius; and that ſeveral had been entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with muſic who had paſſed by it, but never heard that the muſician had before made himſelf viſible. When he had raiſed my thoughts by thoſe tranſporting air which he played, to taſte the pleaſures of his converſation, as I looked upon him like one aſtoniſhed, he beckoned to me, and by the waving of his hand directed me to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the place where he ſat. I drew near with that reverence which is due to a ſuperior nature; and as my heart was entirely ſubdued by the captivating ſtrains I had heard, I fell down at his feet, and wept. The Genius ſmiled upon me with a look of compaſſion and affability, that familiarized him to my imagination, and at once diſpelled all the fears and apprehenſions with which I approached him. He lifted me from the ground, and taking me by the hand, <hi>Mirza,</hi> ſaid he, I have heard thee in thy ſoliloquies, follow me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>He then led me to the higheſt pinnacle of the rock, and placed me on the top of it: caſt thine eye eaſtward, ſaid he, and tell me what thou ſeeſt. I ſee, ſaid I, a huge valley, and a prodigious tide of water rolling through it. The valley that thou ſeeſt, ſaid he, is the vale of miſery;
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:029518_0111_0FE1CD98A9414780"/>
and the tide of water that thou ſeeſt is part of the great tide of eternity. What is the reaſon, ſaid I, that the tide I ſee rises out of a thick miſt at one end, and again <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Upon a more deliberate ſurvey of it, I found that it conſiſted of threeſcore and ten entire arches, with ſeveral <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Genius told me, that this bridge conſiſted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of a thouſand arches; but that a great flood ſwept <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> the reſt, and left the bridge in the ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous condition I now beheld it. But tell me further, ſaid he, what that diſcovereſt on it. I ſee multitudes of people paſſing over it, ſaid I, and a black cloud hanging on each end of it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. As I looked more attentively, I ſaw ſeveral of the paſſengers dropping through the bridge into the great tide that flowed under it; and, upon further examination, perceived there were innumerable trap-doors that lay concealed in the bridge, which the paſſengers no ſooner trode upon, but they fell through them into the tide, and immediately diſappeared. Theſe hidden pit-falls were ſet very thick at the entrance of the bridge, ſo that throngs of people no ſooner broke through the cloud, but many of them fell into them. They grew thinner towards the middle, but multiplied and lay cloſer towards the end of the arches that were entire.</p>
               <p>There were indeed ſome perſons, but their numbers were very ſmall, that continued a kind of hobbling march on the broken arches, but fell through one after another, being quite tired and ſpent with ſo long a walk.</p>
               <p>I paſſed ſome time in the contemplation of this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful ſtructure and the great variety of objects which it preſented. My heart was filled with a deep melancholy, to ſee ſeveral dropping unexpectedly in the midſt of mirth and jollity, and catching at every thing that ſtood by them to ſave themſelves. Some were looking upwards
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:029518_0112_0FE1CD87D3889858"/>
towards the heavens in a thoughtful poſture, and in the midſt of a ſpeculation ſtumbled and fell out of ſight. Multitudes were very buſy in the proſpect of bubbles that glittered in their eyes, and danced before them; but often, when they thought themſelves within the reach of them, their footing failed, and down they ſunk. In this confuſion of objects, I obſerved ſome with ſcyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in their hands, and others with urinals, who ran to and fro upon the bridge, thruſting ſeveral perſons on trap-doors, which did not ſolem to lie in their way, and which they might have eſcaped had they not thus been forced upon them.</p>
               <p>The Genius ſeeing me indulge myſelf in this melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly proſpect, told me I had dwelt long enough upon it: take thine eye off the bridge, ſaid he and tell me if thou ſeeſt any thing thou doſt not comprehend. Upon look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, What mean, ſaid I, theſe great flights of birds that are perpetually hovering about the bridge, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling upon it, from time to time? I ſee vultures, harpies, ravens, cormorants, and among many other feathered creatures, ſeveral little winged boys, that perch in great numbers upon the middle arches. Theſe, ſaid the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, are envy, avarice, ſuperſtition, deſpair, love, with the like cares and paſſions that infeſt human life.</p>
               <p>I here fetched a deep ſigh: alas, ſaid I, man was made in vain! how is he given away to miſery and mortality, tortured in life, and ſwallowed up in death! the Genius being moved with compaſſion towards me, bid me quit to uncomfortable a proſpect. Look no more, ſaid he, on man in the firſt ſtage of his exiſtence, in his ſetting out for eternity; but caſt thine eye on that thick miſt into which the tide bears the tide bears the ſeveral generations of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals that fall into it. I directed my ſight as I was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and (whether or not the good Genius ſtrengthened it with any ſupernatural force, or diſſipated part of the miſt that was before too thick for the eye to penetrate) I ſaw the valley opening at the further end, and ſpreading forth into an immenſe ocean, that had a huge rock of adamant running through the midſt of it, and dividing it into two equal parts. The clouds ſtill reſted on one half of it, inſomuch that I could diſcover nothing in it: but the other appeared to me a vaſt ocean, planted with innumerable iſlands that were covered with fruits and
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:029518_0112_0FE1CD87D3889858"/>
flowers, and interwoven with a thouſand little ſhining ſeas that ran among them. I could ſee perſons dreſſed in glorious habits, with garlands upon their heads, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing among the trees, lying down by the ſides of foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, or reſting on beds of flowers: and could hear a confuſed harmony of ſinging birds, falling waters, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man voices, and muſical inſtruments. Gladneſs grew in me upon the diſcovery of ſo delightful a ſcene. I wiſhed for the wings of an eagle that I might fly away to thoſe happy ſeas: but the Genius told me there was no paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to them, except through the gates of death, that I ſaw opening every moment upon the bridge. The iſlands, ſaid he, that lie ſo freſh and green before thee, and with which the whole face of the ocean appears ſpotted as far as thou canſt ſee, are more in number than the ſands of the ſea ſhore. There are myriads of iſlands beyond thoſe which thou here diſcovereſt reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing farther than thine eye, or even thine imagination can extend itſelf. Theſe are the manſions of good men after death, who, according to the degrees and kinds of virtue in which they excelled, are diſtributed among thoſe ſeveral iſlands, which abound with pleaſures of different kinds and degrees, ſuitable to the reliſhes and perfections of thoſe who are ſettled in them: every iſland is a paradiſe accommodated to its reſpective inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants. Are not theſe, O <hi>Mirza,</hi> habitations worth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending for? Does life appear miſerable, that gives thee opportunities of earning ſuch a reward? Is death to be feared, that will convey thee to ſo happy an exiſtence? Think not man was made in vain, who has ſuch an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity reſerved for him. I gazed with inexpreſſible plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure on theſe happy iſlands. At length, ſaid I, ſhew me now, I beſeech thee, the ſecrets that he hid under thoſe dark clouds which cover the ocean on the other ſide of the rock of adamant. The Genius making me no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, I turned about to addreſs myſelf to him a ſecond time, but I found that he had left me; I then turned again to the viſion which I had been ſo long contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but inſtead of the rolling tide, the arched bridge, and the happy iſlands, I ſaw nothing but the low hollow valley of <hi>Bagdad,</hi> with oxen, ſheep, and camels grazing upon the ſides of it.</p>

               <p>IT has been obſerved by many writers, that nothing makes a more ridiculous figure in a man's life, than the diſparity we often find in him, ſick and well. Thus one of an unfortunate conſtitution is perpetually exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a miſerable example of the weakneſs of his mind, or of his body, in their turns. I have had frequent opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of late to conſider myſelf in theſe different views, and hope I have received ſome advantage by it. If what Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> ſays be true, that
<q>

                        <hi>The ſoul's dark cottage, batter'd and decoy'd,</hi>

Then ſurely ſickneſs, contributing no leſs than old age to the ſhaking down this ſcaffolding of the body, may diſcover the incloſed ſtructure more plainly—Sickneſs is a ſort of early old age; it teaches us a diffidence in our earthly ſtate, and inſpires us with the thoughts of a future, better than a thouſand volumes of philoſophers and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines. It gives ſo alarming a concuſſion to thoſe props of our vanity, our ſtrength and youth, that we think of fortifying ourſelves within, when there is ſo little depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on our outworks. Youth, at the very beſt, is but a betrayer of human life in a gentler and ſmoother manner than age. It is like a ſtream that nouriſhes a plant upon its bank, and cauſes it to flouriſh and bloſſom to the ſight, but at the ſame time is undermining it at the root in ſecret. My youth has dealt more fairly and openly with me; it has afforded me ſeveral proſpects of my dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and given an advantage not very common to young men, ſo that the attractions of the world have not daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled me very much; and I began when moſt people end, with a full conviction of the emptineſs of all ſorts of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the unſatisfactory nature of all human pleaſures.</p>
               <p>When a ſmart fit of ſickneſs tells me this ſcurvy tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my body will fall in a little time, I am even as unconcerned as was that honeſt <hi>Hibernian,</hi> who (being in bed in a great ſtorm ſome years ago, and told that the houſe would tumble over his head) made anſwer, <hi>What care I for the houſe, I am only a lodger.</hi> I fancy it is the beſt

               <p>I HAD lately a very remarkable dream, which made ſo ſtrong an impreſſion on me, that I remember it every word; and if you are not better employed, you may read the relation of it as follows:</p>
               <p>Methought I was in the midſt of a very entertaining ſet of company, and extremely delighted in attending to a lively converſation; when on a ſudden I perceived one of the moſt ſhocking figures imagination can frame, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing towards me. She was dreſſed in black; her ſkin was contracted into a thouſand wrinkles; her eyes deep ſunk in her head; and her complexion pale and livid as the countenance of death. Her looks were filled with terror and unrelenting ſeverity; and her hands armed with whips and ſcorpions. As ſoon as ſhe came near with a horrid frown, and a voice that chilled my very,
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:029518_0114_0FE1CD9D915B9698"/>
blood, ſhe bade me follow her. I obeyed; and ſhe led me through rugged paths, beſet with briars and thorns, into a deep ſolitary valley. Wherever ſhe paſſed, the fading verdure withered beneath her ſteps, her peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial breath infected the air with malignant vapours, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured the luſtre of the ſun, and involved the fair face of heaven in univerſal gloom. Diſmal howlings reſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the foreſt; from every baleful tree the night-raven uttered his dreadful note, and the proſpect was filled with deſolation and horror. In the midſt of this tremendous ſcene, my execrable guide addreſſed me in the following manner:</p>
               <p>"Retire with me, O raſh, unthinking mortal! from the vain allurements of a deceitful world, and learn that pleaſure was not deſigned the portion of human life. Man was born to mourn and to be, wretched: this is the condition of all below the ſtars; and whoever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to oppoſe it, acts in contradiction to the will of heaven. Fly then from the fatal inchantments of youth and ſocial delight, and here conſecrate the ſolitary hours to lamentation and woe. Miſery is the duty of all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary beings; and every enjoyment is an offence to the Deity, who is to be worſhipped only by the mortification of every ſenſe of pleaſure, and the everlaſting exerciſe of ſighs and tears."</p>
               <p>This melancholy picture of life quite ſunk my ſpirits, and ſeemed to annihilate every principle of joy within me. I threw myſelf beneath a blaſted yew, where the winds blew cold and diſmal round my head, and dreadful appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions chilled my heart. Here I reſolved to lie till the hand of death, which I impatiently invoked, ſhould put an end to the miſeries of a life ſo deplorably wretched. In this ſad ſituation, I eſpied on one hand of me a deep muddy river, whoſe heavy waves rolled on in ſlow, ſullen murmurs. Here I determined to plunge; and was juſt upon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rink, when I found myſelf ſuddenly drawn back. I turned about, and was ſurpriſed by the ſight of the lovelieſt object I had ever beheld. The moſt engaging charms of youth and beauty appeared in all her form; effulgent glories ſparkled in her eyes, and their awful ſplendors were ſoftened by the gentleſt looks of compaſſion and peace. At her approach, the frightful ſpectre, who had before tormented me, vaniſhed away, and with her
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:029518_0114_0FE1CD9D915B9698"/>
all the horrors ſhe had cauſed. The gloomy clouds brightened into cheerful ſunſhine, the groves recovered their verdure, and the whole region looked gay and blooming as the garden of <hi>Eden.</hi> I was quite tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at this unexpected change, and reviving pleaſure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to gladden my thoughts; when, with a look of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible ſweetneſs, my beauteous deliverer thus uttered her divine inſtructions:</p>
               <p>"My name is <hi>Religion.</hi> I am the offspring of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and the parent of <hi>Benevolence, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Joy.</hi> That monſter, from whoſe power I have freed you, is called <hi>Superſtition:</hi> ſhe is the child of <hi>Diſcontent,</hi> and her followers are <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Sorrow.</hi> Thus, different as we are, ſhe has often the inſolence to aſſume my name and character, and ſeduces unhappy mortals to think us the ſame, till ſhe at length drives them to the borders of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, that dreadful abyſs into which you were juſt going to ſink.</p>
               <p>"Look round, and ſurvey the various beauties of this globe, which heaven has deſtined for the ſeat of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race; and conſider whether a world, thus exquiſitely framed, could be meant for the abode of miſery and pain. For what end has the laviſh hand of Providence diffuſed ſuch innumerable objects of delight, but that all might rejoice in the priviledge of exiſtence, and be filled with gratitude to the beneficent Author of it? Thus to enjoy the bleſſings he has ſent, is virtue and obedience; and to reject them merelyas means of pleaſure, is pitiable ignorance, or abſurd perverſeneſs. Infinite goodneſs is the ſource of created exiſtence.

to immoral pleaſure corrupts the mind; living to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal and trifling ones, debaſes it; both in their degrees diſqualify it for its genuine good, and conſign it over to wretchedneſs. Whoever would be really happy, muſt make the diligent and regular exerciſe of his ſuperior powers his chief attention; adoring the perfections of his Maker, expreſſing good-will to his fellow-creatures, and cultivating inward rectitude. To his lower faculties he muſt allow ſuch gratifications as will, by refreſhing them, invigorate his nobler purſuits. In the regions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by angelic natures, unmingled felicity for ever blooms; joy flows there with a perpetual and abundant ſtream, nor needs there any mound to check its courſe. Beings conſcious of a frame of mind originally diſeaſed, as all the human race has cauſe to be, muſt uſe the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of a ſtricter ſelf-government. Whoever has been guilty of voluntary exceſſes, muſt patiently ſubmit both to the painful workings of nature, and needful ſeverities of medicines, in order to his cure. Still he is entitled to a moderate ſhare of whatever alleviating accommodations this fair manſion of his merciful Purent affords, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with his recovery. And in proportion as his recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery advances, the livelieſt joy will ſpring from his ſecret ſenſe of an amended and improved heart. So far from the horrors of deſpair is the condition even of the guilty. Shudder, poor mortal, at the thought of the gulph into which thou waſt juſt now going to plunge.</p>
               <p>"While the moſt faulty have every encouragement to mend, the more innocent ſoul will be ſupported with ſtill ſweeter conſolations under all its experience of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man infirmities; ſupported by the gladdening aſſurances, that every ſincere endeavour to outgrow them ſhall be aſſiſted, accepted, and rewarded. To ſuch a one, the loweſt ſelf-abaſement is but a deep-laid foundation for the moſt elevated hopes; ſince they who faithfully exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and acknowledge what they are, ſhall be enabled, under my conduct, to become what they deſire. The Chriſtian and the hero are inſeparable; and to the aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of unaſſuming truſt and filial confidence, are ſet no bounds. To him who is animated with a view of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing approbation from the Sovereign of the univerſe, no difficulty is inſurmountable. Secure in his purſuit of every needful aid, his conflict with the ſevereſt pains and
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:029518_0115_0FE1CD9F2DAAEEE8"/>
trials is little more than the vigorous exerciſes of a mind in health. His patient dependence on that Providence which looks through all eternity, his ſilent reſignation, his ready accommodation of his thoughts and behaviour to its inſcrutable ways, is at once the moſt excellent ſort of ſelf-denial, and ſource of the moſt exalted tranſports. Society is the true ſphere of human virtue. In ſocial active life, difficulties will perpetually be met with; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints of many kinds will be neceſſary; and ſtudying to behave right in reſpect of theſe, is a diſcipline of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man heart, uſeful to others, and improving to itſelf. Suffering is no duty, but where it is neceſſary to avoid guilt, or to do good; nor pleaſure a crime, but where it ſtrengthens the influence of bad inclinations, or leſſens the generous activity of virtue. The happineſs allotted to man in his preſent ſtate, is indeed faint and low, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with his immortal proſpects and noble capacities: but yet, whatever portion of it the diſtributing hand of heaven offers to each individual, is a needful ſupport and refreſhment for the preſent moment, ſo far as it may not hinder the attaining his final deſtination.</p>
               <p>"Return then with me from continual miſery, to mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate enjoyment, and grateful alacrity; return from the contracted views of ſolitude, to the proper duties of a rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative and dependent being. <hi>Religion</hi> is not confined to cells and cloſets, nor reſtrained to ſullen retirement.

               <p>FOR the benefit of thoſe who are diſſatisfied with their preſent ſituations, and to illuſtrate the folly and madneſs of their ambition, I beg leave to offer the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of my own life.</p>
               <p>I am the ſon of the younger brother of a good family, who at his deceaſe left me a little fortune of a hundred a year. I was put early to <hi>Eaton</hi> ſchool, where I learned <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> from whence I went to the Univerſity,
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:029518_0116_0FE1CDABAF9B0300"/>
where I learned not totally to forget them. I came to my fortune when I was at the college; and having no inclination to follow any profeſſion, I removed myſelf to town, and lived for ſome time, as moſt young fellows do, by ſpending four times my income. But it was my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, before it was too late, to fall in love with, and marry a very amiable young creature, whoſe fortune was juſt ſufficient to repair the breach made in my own. With this agreeable companion I retreated to the country, and endeavoured, as well as I was able, to ſquare my wiſhes to my circumſtances. In this endeavour I ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſo well, that, excepting a few private hankerings after a little more than I poſſeſſed, and now and then a ſigh when a coach and ſix happened to drive by me in my walks, I was a happy man.</p>
               <p>I can truly aſſure you, Sir, that though our family-economy was not much to be boaſted of, and in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of it we were frequently driven to great ſtraits and difficulties, I experienced more real ſatisfaction in this humble ſituation, than I have ever done ſince in more enviable circumſtances. We were ſometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a little in debt, but when money came in, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of diſcharging what we owed was more than an equiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alent for theſe pains it put us to; and though the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs of our circumſtances ſubjected us to many cares and anxieties, it ſerved to keep the body in action as well, as the mind: ſor as our garden was ſomewhat large, and required more hands to keep it in order than we could afford to hire, we laboured daily in it ourſelves, and drew health from our neceſſities.</p>
               <p>I had a little boy, who was the delight of my heart, and who probably might have been ſpoiled by nurſing, if the attention of his parents had not been otherwiſe employed. His mother was naturally of a ſickly conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, but the affairs of her family, as they engroſſed all her thoughts, gave her no time for complaint. The ordinary troubles of life, which to thoſe who have noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing elſe to think of, are almoſt inſupportable, were leſs terrible to us than to perſons of eaſier circumſtances; for it is a certain truth, however your readers may pleaſe to receive it, that where the mind is divided among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cares, the anxiety is lighter than when there is only one to contend with. Or even in the happieſt ſituation,
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:029518_0117_0FE1CDAD544FCC70"/>
in the midſt of eaſe, I health, and affluence, the mind is generally ingenious at tormenting itſelf, loſing the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate enjoyment of thoſe invaluable bleſſings, by the painful ſuggeſtion that they are too great for continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the reflections that I have made ſince; for I do not attempt to deny that I ſighed frequently for an addition to my fortune. The death of a diſtant relation, which happened five years after our marriage, gave me this addition, and made me for a time the happieſt man living. My income was now increaſed to ſix hundred a year; and I hoped, with a little oeconomy, to be able to make a figure with it. But the ill health of my wife, which in leſs eaſy circumſtances had not touched me ſo nearly, was now conſtantly in my thoughts, and ſoured all my enjoyment. The conſciouſneſs too of having ſuch an eſtate to leave my boy, made me ſo anxious to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve hire, that inſtead of ſuffering him to run at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure when he pleaſed, and to grow hardy by exerciſe, I almoſt deſtroyed him by confinement. We now did nothing in our garden, becauſe we were in circumſtances to have it kept by others: but as the air and exerciſe were neceſſary for our healths, we reſolved to abridge ourſelves in ſome unneceſſary articles, and ſet up an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page. This in time brought with it a train of expences, which we had neither prudence to foreſee, nor courage to prevent. For as it enabled us to extend the circuit of our viſits, it greatly increaſed our acquaintance, and ſubjected us to the neceſſity of making continual enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments at home, in return for all thoſe to which we were invited abroad. The charges that attended this new manner of living were much too great for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come we poſſeſſed; inſomuch that we found ourſelves in a very ſhort time more neceſſitous than ever. Pride would not ſuffer us to lay down our equipage; and to live in a manner ſuitable to it, was what we could not bear to think of. To pay the debts I had contracted, I was ſoon forced to mortgage, and at laſt to ſell the beſt part of my eſtate; and as it was utterly impoſſible to keep up the parade any longer, we thought it adviſeable to remove of a ſudden, to ſell our coach in town, and to look out for a new ſituation, at a greater diſtance from our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="235" facs="unknown:029518_0117_0FE1CDAD544FCC70"/>
But, unfortunately for my peace, I carried the habit of expence along with me, and was very near being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to abſolute want, when, by the unexpected death of an uncle and his two ſons, who died within a few weeks of each other, I ſucceeded to an eſtate of ſeven thouſand pounds a year.</p>
               <p>And now, Sir, both you and your readers will call me a very happy man; and ſo indeed I was; I ſet about the regulation of my family with the moſt pleaſing ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the ſplendour of my equipages, the magnificence of my plate, the crowd of ſervants that attended me, the elegance of my houſe and furniture, the grandeur of my park and gardens, the luxury of my table, and the court that was every where paid me, gave me inexpreſſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, ſo long as they were novelties, but no ſooner were they become habitual to me, than I loſt all manner of reliſh for them; and diſcovered, in a very little time, that by having nothing to wiſh for, I had nothing to enjoy. My appetites grew pallid by ſatiety, a perpetual crowd of viſitors robbed me of all domeſtic enjoyment, my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants plagued me, and my ſteward cheated me.</p>
               <p>But the curſe of greatneſs did not end here. Daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience convinced me that I was compelled to live more for others than for myſelf. My uncle had been a great party man, and a zealous oppoſer of all miniſterial mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; as his eſtate was the largeſt of any gentleman in the county, he ſupported an intereſt in it beyond any of his competitors. My father had been greatly obliged by the court party, which determined me, in gratitude, to declare myſelf on that ſide; but the difficulties I had to encounter were too many and too great for me; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that I have been baffled and defeated in almoſt every thing I have undertaken. To deſert the cauſe I have embarked in, would diſgrace me; and to go great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er lengths in it will almoſt undo me. I am engaged in a perpetual ſtate of warfare with the principal gentry of the county, and am curſed by my tenants and dependants, for compelling them at every election to vote (as they are pleaſed to tell me) contrary to their conſciences.</p>
               <p>My wife and I once pleaſed ourſelves with the thoughts of being uſeful to the neighbourhood, by dealing out our charity to the poor and Induſtrious; but the perpet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual hurry in which we live, renders us incapable of look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:029518_0118_0FE1CDAEF0637380"/>
out for objects ourſelves; and the agents we entruſt are either pocketing our bounty, or beſtowing it upon the undeſerving. At night, when we retire to reſt, we are venting our complaints on the miſeries of the day, and praying heartily for the return of that peace, which was the only companion of our humbleſt ſituation.</p>
               <p>Where pain, ſickneſs, and abſolute want are out of the queſtion, no external change of circumſtances can make a man more laſtingly happy than he was before. It is to an ignorance of this truth, that the univerſal diſſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mankind is principally to be aſcribed. Care is the lot of life; and he that aſpires to greatneſs, in hopes to get rid of it, is like one who throws himſelf into a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace to avoid the ſhivering of an ague.</p>
               <p>The only ſatisfaction I can enjoy in my preſent ſituation is, that it has not pleaſed heaven in its wrath to make me a King.</p>

               <p>A CERTAIN <hi>Cardinal,</hi> who for the multitude of his generous actions was ſtyled the Patron of the Poor, had a conſtant cuſtom, once or twice a week, to give public audience to all indigent people in the hall of his palace, and to relieve every one according to their various neceſſities, or the motives of his own bounty.</p>
               <p>One day a poor woman, encouraged by the fame of his generoſity, came into the hall of this <hi>Cardinal</hi> with her only daughter, a beautiful maid about fifteen years of age. When her turn came to be heard among the crowd of petitioners, the <hi>Cardinal</hi> diſcerning the marks of an extraordinary modeſty in her face and carriage, as alſo in her daughter's encouraged her to tell her wants freely. She bluſhing, and not without tears, thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed herſelf to him: "My Lord, I owe for the rent of my houſe five crowns, and ſuch is my misfortune, that I have no other means to pay it, ſave what would break my heart, ſince my landlord threatens to force me to it; that is, to proſtitute this my only daughter, whom I have hitherto with great care educated in virtue, and an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of that odious crime.

is, that you would be pleaſed to interpoſe your ſacred authority, and protect us from the violence of this cruel man, till by our honeſt induſtry we can procure the money for him."</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cardinal,</hi> moved with admiration of the woman's virtue and innocent modeſty, bid her be of good courage.

               <p>The poor woman overjoyed, and returning the <hi>Cardinal</hi> a thouſand thanks, went directly to the ſteward, and gave him the note; which, when he had read, he told her out fifty crowns.

               <p>On the other hand, the ſteward inſiſted on his maſter's order, not daring to call it in queſtion. But all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments he could uſe were inſufficient to prevail on her to take any more than five crowns. Whereupon, to end the controverſy, he offered to go back with her to the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> and refer it to him.

FLAVILLA, juſt as ſhe had entered her fourteenth year, was left an orphan to the care of her mother, in ſuch circumſtances as diſappointed all the hopes which her education had encouraged. Her father, who lived in great elegance upon the ſalary of a place at court, died ſuddenly, without having made any proviſion for his family, except an annuity of one hundred pounds, which he had purchaſed for his wife with part of her marriage portion; nor was he poſſeſſed of any property, except the furniture of a large houſe in one of the ſquares, an equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, a few jewels, and ſome plate.</p>
               <p>The greater part of the furniture and the equipage were ſold to pay his debts; the jewels, which were not of great value, and ſome uſeful pieces of the plate, were reſerved; and <hi>Flavilla</hi> removed with her mother into lodgings.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding this change in their circumſtances, they did not immediately loſe their rank. They were ſtill viſited by a numerous and polite acquaintance; and though ſome gratified their pride, by aſſuming an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of pity, and rather inſulted than alleviated their diſtreſſes by the whine of condolence, and a minute com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of what they had loſt with what they poſſeſſed; yet from others they were continually receiving preſents, which ſtill enabled them to live with a genteel frugality; they were ſtill conſidered as people of faſhion, and treated by thoſe of a lower claſs with diſtinct reſpect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Flavilla</hi> thus continued to move in a ſphere to which ſhe had no claim; ſhe was remarkably tall for her age, and was celebrated not only for her beauty, but her wit: theſe qualifications ſhe conſidered, not only as ſecuring whatever ſhe enjoyed by the favour of others, but as a pledge of poſſeſſing them in her own right by an advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous marriage.</p>
               <p>There was a faſhionable levity in her carriage and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which her mother, who knew the danger of her ſituation, laboured to reſtrain, ſometimes with anger, and ſometimes with tears, but always without ſucceſs. <hi>Flavilla</hi> was ever ready to anſwer, That ſhe neither did nor ſaid any thing of which ſhe had reaſon to be aſhamed; and therefore did not know why ſhe ſhould be reſtrained, except in mere courteſy to envy, which it was an honor to provoke; or to ſlander which it was a diſgrace to fear.
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:029518_0119_0FE1CDB0940D2DC0"/>
In proportion as <hi>Flavilla</hi> was more flattered and careſſed, the influence of her mother became leſs; and though ſhe always treated her with reſpect from a point of good-breeding, yet ſhe ſecretly deſpiſed her maxims, and applauded her own conduct.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Flavilla</hi> at eighteen was a celebrated toaſt; and among other gay viſitants who frequented her tea table was <hi>Clodio,</hi> a young Baronet, who had juſt taken poſſeſſion of his title and eſtate. There were many particulars in <hi>Clodio'</hi>s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, which encouraged <hi>Flavilla</hi> to hope that ſhe ſhould obtain him for a huſband; but ſhe ſuffered his aſſiduities with ſuch apparent pleaſure, and his familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with ſo little reſerve, that he ſoon ventured to diſcloſe his intention, and make her what he thought, a very genteel propoſal of another kind: but, whatever were the artifices with which it was introduced, or the terms in which it was made, <hi>Flavilla</hi> rejected it with the utmoſt indignation and diſdain. <hi>Clodio,</hi> who notwithſtanding his youth, had long known, and often practiſed the art ſeduction, gave way to the ſtorm, threw himſelf at her feet, imputed his offence to the frenzy of his paſſion, flattered her pride by the moſt abject ſubmiſſion, and extravagant praiſe, intreated her pardon, aggravated his crime, but made no mention of atonement by marriage. This particular, which <hi>Flavilla</hi> did not fail to remark, ought to have determined her to admit him no more: but her vanity and her ambition were ſtill predominant, ſhe ſtill hoped to ſucceed in her project. <hi>Clodio's</hi> offence was tacitly forgiven, his viſits were permitted, his familiarities were again ſuffered, and his hopes revived. He had long entertained an opinion that ſhe loved him, in which, however, it is probable, that his own vanity and her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion concurred to deceive him; but this opinion, though it implied the ſtrongeſt obligation to treat her with generoſity and tenderneſs, only determined him again to attempt her ruin, as it encouraged him with a probability of ſucceſs. Having therefore reſolved to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her as a miſtreſs, or at once to give her up, he thought he had little more to do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>han to convince her that he had taken ſuch a reſolution, juſtifying it by ſome plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſophiſtry, and give her ſome time to deliberate upon a final determination. With this view he went a ſhort journey into the country; having put a letter into her
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:029518_0120_0FE1CDBE1DE68A80"/>
hand at parting, in which he acquainted her, "That he had often reflected, with inexpreſſible regret upon her reſentment to his conduct in a late inſtance; but that the delicacy and the ardour of his affections were inſuperable obſtacles to his marriage. That where there was no liberty there could be no happineſs: that he ſhould become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to the endearments of love, when it could no longer be diſtinguiſhed from the officiouſneſs of duty: that while they were happy in the poſſeſſion of each other, it would be abſurd to ſuppoſe they would part: and if this happineſs ſhould ceaſe, it would not only enſure, but aggravate their miſery to be inſeparably united: that this event was leſs probable, in proportion as their cohabita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was voluntary; but that he would make ſuch provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for her upon the contingency, as a wife would expect upon his death."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Flavilla</hi> had too much underſtanding as well as virtue to deliberate a moment upon this propoſal. She gave immediate orders that <hi>Clodio</hi> ſhould be admitted no more. But his letter was a temptation to gratify her vanity, which ſhe could not reſiſt; ſhe ſhewed it firſt to her mother, and then to the whole circle of her female acquaintance, with all the exultation of a hero who expoſes a vanquiſhed enemy at the wheels of his chariot in triumph; ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered it as an indiſputable evidence of her virtue, as a reproof to all who had dared to cenſure the levity of her conduct, and a licence to continue it without apology or reſtraint.</p>
               <p>It happened that <hi>Flavilla,</hi> ſoon after this accident, was ſeen in one of the boxes of the play-houſe by <hi>Mercator,</hi> a young gentleman who had juſt returned from his firſt voyage, as a captain of a large ſhip in the <hi>Levant</hi> trade, which had been purchaſed for him by his father, whoſe fortune enabled him to make a genteel proviſion for five ſons, of whom <hi>Mercator</hi> was the youngeſt, and who expected to ſhare his eſtate, which was perſonal, in equal proportion at his death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mercator</hi> was captivated with her beauty, but diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged by the ſplendor of her appearance, and the rank of her company. He was urged, rather by curioſity than hope, to inquire who ſhe was; and he ſoon gained ſuch a knowledge of her circumſtances, as relieved him from deſpair.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="241" facs="unknown:029518_0120_0FE1CDBE1DE68A80"/>
As he knew not how to get admiſſion into her company, and had no deſign upon her virtue, he wrote in the firſt ardour of his paſſion to her mother; giving a faithful account of his fortune and dependence, and intreating that he might be permitted to viſit <hi>Flavilla,</hi> as a candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date for her affections. The old lady, after having made ſome inquiries, by which the account that <hi>Mercator</hi> had given her was confirmed, ſent him an invitation, and received his firſt viſit alone. She told him, that as <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villa</hi> had no fortune, and as a conſiderable part of his own was dependent upon his father's will, he ought therefore to obtain his conſent before any other ſtep was taken. To this counſel, ſo ſalutary, <hi>Mercator</hi> was heſitating what to reply, when <hi>Flavilla</hi> came in, an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent which he was now only ſolicitous to improve. <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villa</hi> was not diſpleaſed either with his perſon or addreſs; the frankneſs and gaiety of her diſpoſition ſoon made him forget that he was a ſtranger; a converſation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced, during which they became yet more pleaſed with each other; and having thus ſurmounted the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of a firſt viſit, he thought no more of the old lady, as he believed her auſpices were not neceſſary to his ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>His viſits were often repeated, and he became every hour more impatient of delay: a thought of his father would now and then indeed intervene; but being deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to gratify his wiſhes at all events, he concluded with a ſagacity almoſt univerſal upon theſe occaſions, that of two evils, to marry without his conſent, was leſs than to marry againſt it; and one evening, after the lovers had ſpent the afternoon by themſelves, they went out in a kind of frolic, which <hi>Mercator</hi> had propoſed in the vehemence of his paſſion, and to which <hi>Flavilla</hi> had conſented in the giddineſs of her indiſcretion, and were married at <hi>May-Fair.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the firſt interval of recollection after this precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate ſtep, <hi>Mercator</hi> conſidered, that he ought to be the firſt who acquainted his father of the new alliance which had been made in his family. But as he had not forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude enough to do it in perſon, he expreſſed it in the beſt terms he could conceive by a letter; and after ſuch an apology for his conduct as he had been uſed to make for himſelf, he requeſted that he might be permitted to
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:029518_0121_0FE1CDBB765633B8"/>
preſent his wife for the parental benediction, which alone was wanting to complete his felicity.</p>
               <p>The old gentleman, whoſe character I cannot better expreſs than in the faſhionable phraſe which has been contrived to palliate falſe principles and diſſolute man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, had been a gay man, and was well acquainted with the town. He had often heard <hi>Flavilla</hi> toaſted by rakes of quality, and had often ſeen her at public places. Her beauty and her dependence, the gaiety of her dreſs, and the multitude of her admirers, the levity of her conduct, and all the circumſtances of her ſituation, had concurred to render her character ſuſpected; and he was diſpoſed to judge of it with leſs charity, when ſhe had offended him by marrying his ſon, whom he conſidered as diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and impoveriſhed, and whoſe misfortune, as it was irretrievable, he reſolved not to alleviate, but increaſe; a reſolution by which fathers, who have fooliſh and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient ſons, uſually diſplay their own kindneſs and wiſdo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As ſoon as he had read <hi>Mercator's</hi> letter, he curſed him for a fool, who had been gulled by the artifice of a ſtrumpet, to ſcreen her from public infamy, by fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering her children, and ſecuring her from a priſon by appropriating her debts. In an anſwer to his letter, which he wrote only to gratify his reſentment, he told him, that "if he had taken <hi>Flavilla</hi> into keeping, he would have overlooked it; and if her extravagance had diſtreſſed him, he would have ſatisfied his creditors; but that his marriage was not to be forgiven; that he never ſhould have another ſhilling of his money; and that he was determined to ſee him no more."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mercator,</hi> who was more provoked by this outrage than grieved at his loſs, diſdained to reply; and believing that he had now moſt reaſon to be offended, could not be perſuaded to ſolicit a reconciliation.</p>
               <p>He hired a genteel apartment for his wife of an uphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterer, who, with a view to let lodgings, had taken and furniſhed a large houſe near <hi>Leiceſter Fields,</hi> and in about two months left her to make another voyage.</p>
               <p>He had received viſits of congratulation from her nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous acquaintance, and had returned them, as a pledge of his deſire that they ſhould be repeated. But a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the gay multitude, which while he was at home had flattered his vanity, as ſoon as he was abſent
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:029518_0121_0FE1CDBB765633B8"/>
alarmed his ſuſpicion: he had, indeed, no particular cauſe of jealouſy; but his anxiety aroſe merely from a ſenſe of the temptations to which ſhe was expoſed, and the impoſſibility of his ſuperintending her conduct.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, <hi>Flavilla</hi> continued to flutter round the ſame giddy circle in which ſhe had ſhone ſo long; the number of her viſitants was rather increaſed than diminiſhed; the gentlemen attended her with greater aſſiduity, and ſhe continued to encourage their civilities by the ſame indecent familiarity: ſhe was one night at the maſquerade, and another at the opera; ſometimes at a rout, and ſometimes rambling in a party of pleaſure in ſhort excurſions from town; ſhe came home ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at midnight, ſometimes in the morning, and ſometimes ſhe was abſent ſeveral nights together.</p>
               <p>This conduct was the cauſe of much ſpeculation and uneaſineſs to the good man and good woman of the houſe. At firſt they ſuſpected that <hi>Flavilla</hi> was no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a woman of pleaſure; and that the perſon who had hired the lodgings for her as his wife, (and had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared upon preſence of going a voyage to ſea) had been employed to impoſe upon them, by concealing her character, in order to obtain ſuch accommodations for her as ſhe could not ſo eaſily have procured had it been known: but as theſe ſuſpicions made them watchful and inquiſitive, they ſoon diſcovered, that many ladies by whom ſhe was viſited were of good character and faſhion. Her conduct, however, ſuppoſing her to be a wife, was ſtill inexcuſable, and ſtill endangered her credit and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence: hints were often dropped by the neighbours to the diſadvantage of her character; and an elderly maiden lady, who lodged in the ſecond floor, had given warning; the family was diſturbed at all hours of the night, and the door was crowded all day with meſſengers and viſitants to <hi>Flavilla.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One day, therefore, the good woman took an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to remonſtrate, though in the moſt diſtant and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectful terms, and with the utmoſt diffidence and caution, ſhe told <hi>Flavilla,</hi> "That ſhe was a fine young lady; that her huſband was abroad; that ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

be ruined by thoſe ſlanders which could have no influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the great, and which therefore, they were not ſolicitous to avoid."</p>
               <p>This addreſs, however ambiguous, and however gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, was eaſily underſtood, and fiercely reſented.<hi>Flavilla,</hi> proud of her virtue, and impatient of controul, would have deſpiſed the counſel of a philoſopher, if he had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied an impeachment of her conduct: before a perſon ſo much her inferior, therefore, ſhe was under no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint; but anſwered with a mixture of contempt and indignation, "That thoſe only who did not know her would dare to take any liberty with her character; and warned her to propagate no ſcandalous report, at her peril." <hi>Flavilla</hi> immediately roſe from her ſeat, and the woman departed without reply, though ſhe was ſcarce leſs offended than her lodger; and from that moment ſhe determined when <hi>Mercator</hi> returned, to give her warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mercator's</hi> voyage was proſperous, and after an abſence of about ten months, he came back. The woman, to whom her huſband left the whole management of the lodgings, and who perſiſted in her purpoſe, ſoon found an opportunity to put it in execution.<hi>Mercator,</hi> as his part of the contract had been punctually fulfilled, thought he had ſome cauſe to be offended, and inſiſted to know her reaſons for compelling him to leave her houſe. Theſe, his hoſteſs, who was indeed a very friendly wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, was very unwilling to give; and as he perceived that ſhe evaded his queſtion, he became more ſolicitous to obtain an anſwer. After much heſitation, which perhaps had a worſe effect than any tale which malice could have invented, ſhe told him, that, "Madam kept a great deal of company, and had often ſtaid out very late: that ſhe had always been uſed to quietneſs and regularity: and was determined to let her apartments to ſome perſon in a more private ſtation."</p>
               <p>At this account <hi>Mercator</hi> changed countenance; for he Inferred from it juſt as much more than truth as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it to be leſs. After ſome moments of ſuſpence, he conjured her to conceal nothing from him, with an emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which convinced her ſhe had already ſaid too much. She then aſſured him, "That he had no reaſon to be alarmed; for that ſhe had no exception to his lady, but
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:029518_0122_0FE1CDBFC10D7860"/>
thoſe gaieties which her ſtation and the faſhion ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly authorized." <hi>Mercator's</hi> ſuſpicions, however, were not wholly removed; and he began to think he had found a confidante, whom it would be his intereſt to truſt: he therefore, in the folly of his jealouſy, confeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, "That he had ſome doubts concerning his wife, which it was of the utmoſt importance to his honour and his peace to reſolve: he intreated her that he might continue in the apartment another year: that as he ſhould again leave the kingdom in a ſhort time, ſhe would ſuffer no incident, which might confirm either his hopes or fears, to eſcape her notice in his abſence; and that at his return, ſhe would give him ſuch an account as would at leaſt deliver him from the torment of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and determine his future conduct."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mercator,</hi> however, concealed his ſuſpicions from his wife; and, indeed, in her preſence they were forgotten. Her manner of life he began ſeriouſly to diſapprove; but being well acquainted with her temper, in which great ſweetneſs was blended with a high ſpirit, he would not embitter the pleaſure of a ſhort ſtay by altercation, chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and tears: but when her mind was melted into tenderneſs at his departure, he claſped her in an ecſtaſy of fondneſs to his boſom, and intreated her to behave with reſerve and circumſpection: "becauſe, ſaid he, I know that my father keeps a watchful eye upon your conduct, which may, therefore, confirm or remove his diſpleaſure, and either intercept or beſtow ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in our fortune, as will prevent the pangs of ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which muſt otherwiſe ſo often return, and in a ſhort time unite us to part no more." To this caution ſhe had then no power to reply; and they parted with mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual proteſtations of unalterable love.</p>

               <p>FLAVILLA, ſoon after ſhe was thus left in a kind of widowhood a ſecond time, found herſelf with child; and within ſomewhat leſs than eight months after <hi>Merca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's</hi> return from his firſt voyage, ſhe happened to ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as ſhe was going up ſtairs, and being immediately taken ill, ſhe was brought to bed before the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The child, though its birth had been precipitated
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:029518_0123_0FE1CDC15DDAAB70"/>
more than a month, was not remarkably ſmall, nor had any infirmity which endangered its life.</p>
               <p>It was now neceſſary that the vigils of whiſts, and the tumults of balls and viſits ſhould, for a while, be ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and in this interval of languor and retirement, <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villa</hi> firſt became thoughtful. She often reflected upon <hi>Mercator's</hi> caution when they laſt parted, which had made an indelible impreſſion upon her mind, though it had produced no alteration in her conduct: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the manner in which it was expreſſed, and the reaſon upon which it was founded, ſhe began to fear that it might have been ſecretly prompted by jealouſy. The birth, therefore, of her firſt child in his abſence, at a time when, if it had not been premature, it could not poſſibly have been his, was an accident which greatly alarmed her: but there was yet another, for which it was ſtill leſs in her power to account, and which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alarmed her ſtill more.</p>
               <p>It happened that ſome civilities which ſhe received from a lady who ſat next her at an opera, and whom ſhe had never ſeen before, introduced a converſation, which ſo greatly delighted her, that ſhe gave her a preſſing invitation to viſit her: this invitation was accepted, and in a few days the viſit was paid. <hi>Flavilla</hi> was not leſs pleaſed at the ſecond interview than ſhe had been at the firſt; and without making any other inquiry concerning the lady, than where ſhe lived, took the firſt opportunity to wait upon her. The apartment in which ſhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, was the ground-floor of an elegant houſe, at a ſmall diſtance from St. <hi>James's.</hi> It happened that <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villa</hi> was placed near the window; and a party of the horſe—guards riding through the ſtreets, ſhe expected to ſee ſome of the royal family, and haſtily threw up the faſh. A gentleman who was paſſing by at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, turned about at the noiſe of the window, and <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villa</hi> no ſooner ſaw his face, than ſhe knew him to be the father of <hi>Mercator.</hi> After looking firſt ſteadfaſtly at her, and then glancing his eye at the lady whom ſhe was viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he affected a contemptuous ſneer, and went on. <hi>Flavilla,</hi> who had been thrown into ſome confuſion, by the ſudden and unexpected ſight of a perſon who ſhe knew conſidered her as the diſgrace of his family, and the ruin of his child, now changed countenance, and
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:029518_0123_0FE1CDC15DDAAB70"/>
haſtily retired to another part of the room: ſhe was touched both with grief and anger at this ſilent inſult, of which, however, ſhe did not then ſuſpect the cauſe. It is, indeed, probable, that the father of <hi>Mercator</hi> would no where have looked upon her with complacency; but as ſoon as he ſaw her companion, he recollected that ſhe was the favourite miſtreſs of an old courtier, and that this was the houſe in which he kept her in great ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, though ſhe had been by turns a proſtitute to many others. It happened that <hi>Flavilla,</hi> ſoon after this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, diſcovered the character of her new acquaintance; and never remembered by whom ſhe had been ſeen in her company, without the utmoſt regret and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>She now reſolved to move in a leſs circle, and with more circumſpection. In the mean time her little boy, whom ſhe ſuckled, grew very faſt; and it could no longer be known by his appearance that he had been born too ſoon. His mother frequently gazed on him till her eyes overflowed with tears; and though her pleaſures were now become domeſtic, yet ſhe feared leſt that which had produced, ſhould deſtroy them. After much deliberation, ſhe determined that ſhe would conceal the child's age from its father, believing it prudent to prevent a ſuſpicion, which, however ill founded, it might be difficult to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, as her juſtification would depend wholly upon the teſtimony of her dependants; and her mother's and her own would neceſſarily become doubtful, when every one would have reaſon to conclude, that it would ſtill have been the ſame, ſuppoſing the contrary to have been true.</p>
               <p>Such was the ſtate of <hi>Flavilla'</hi>s mind, and her little boy was ſix months old when <hi>Mercator</hi> returned. She received him with joy indeed, but it was mixed with a viſible confuſion; their meeting was more tender, but on her part it was leſs cheerful; ſhe ſmiled with inexpreſſible complacency, but at the ſame time the tears guſhed from her eyes, and ſhe was ſeized with an univerſal tremor. <hi>Mercator</hi> caught the infection; and careſſed firſt his <hi>Flavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> and then his boy, with an exceſs of fondneſs and delight that before he had never experienced. The ſight of the child made him more than ever wiſh a reconciliation with his father; and having heard at his firſt landing that he was dangerouſly ill, he determined to go immediately
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:029518_0124_0FE1CDCC8EACC278"/>
and attempt to ſee him, promiſing that he would return to ſupper. He had in the midſt of his careſſes more than once inquired the age of his ſon, but the queſtion had been always evaded; of which, however, he took to notice, nor did it produce any ſuſpicion.</p>
               <p>He was now haſtening to inquire after his father; but as he paſſed through the hall, he was officiouſly laid hold of by the landlady. He was not much diſpoſed to inquire how ſhe had fulfilled his charge; but perceiving by her looks that ſhe had ſomething to communicate, which at leaſt in her own opinion was of importance, he ſuffered her to take him into her parlour. She immediately ſhut the door, and reminded him, that ſhe had undertaken an office with reluctance which he preſſed upon her; and that ſhe had done nothing in it to which he had not bound her by a promiſe; that ſhe was exceeding ſorry to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate her diſcoveries; but that he was a worthy gentleman indeed, and ought to know them. She then told him, <q>That the child was born within leſs than eight months after his laſt return from abroad; that it was ſaid to have come before its time, but that having preſſed to ſee it, ſhe was refuſed.</q> This indeed was true, and confirmed the good woman in her ſuſpicion; for <hi>Flavilla,</hi> who had ſtill reſented the freedom which ſhe had taken in her remonſtrance, had kept her at a great diſtance; and the ſervants, to gratify their miſtreſs, treated her with the utmoſt inſolence and contempt.</p>
               <p>At this relation <hi>Mercator</hi> turned pale. He now recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected that his queſtion concerning the child's birth had been evaded; and concluded, that he had been ſhedding tears of tenderneſs and joy over a ſtrumpet and a baſtard, who had robbed him of his patrimony, his honor, and his peace. He ſtarted up with the furious wildneſs of ſudden frenzy; but ſhe with great difficulty prevailed upon him not to leave the room. He ſat down, and remained ſome time motionleſs, with his eyes fixed on the ground, and his hands locked in each other. In proportion as he believed his wife to be guilty, his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs for his father revived; and he reſolved, with yet greater zeal, to proſecute his purpoſe of immediately attempting a reconciliation.</p>
               <p>In this ſtate of confuſion and diſtreſs, he went to the houſe, where he learned that his father had died early in
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:029518_0124_0FE1CDCC8EACC278"/>
the morning, and that his relations were then aſſembled to read his will. <hi>Fulvius,</hi> a brother of <hi>Mercator's</hi> mother, with whom he had always been a favourite, happening to paſs from one room to another, heard his voice. He accoſted him with great ardour and friendſhip; and ſoothing him with expreſſions of condolence and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, inſiſted to introduce him to the company. <hi>Mercator</hi> tacitly conſented: he was received at laſt with civility by his brothers, and ſitting down among them, the will was read. He ſeemed to liſten like the reſt; but was indeed muſing over the ſtory which he had juſt heard, and loſt in the ſpeculations of his own wretchedneſs. He awaked as from a dream, when the voice of the perſon who had been reading was ſuſpended; and finding that he could no longer contain himſelf, he ſtarted up, and would have left the company.</p>
               <p>Of the will which had been read before him, he knew nothing: but his uncle believing that he was moved with grief and reſentment at the manner in which he had been mentioned in it, and the bequeſt only of a ſhilling, took him into another room; and, to apologize for his father's unkindneſs, told him, "That the reſentment which he expreſſed at his marriage, was every day increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the conduct of his wife, whoſe character was now become notoriouſly infamous, for that ſhe had been ſeen at the lodgings of a known proſtitute, with whom ſhe appeared to be well acquainted." This account threw <hi>Mercator</hi> into another agony: from which he was, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, at length recovered by his uncle, who, as the only expedient by which he could retrieve his misfortune, and ſooth his diſtreſs, propoſed that he ſhould no more return to his lodgings, but go home with him; that he would himſelf take ſuch meaſures with his wife as would ſcarce fail of inducing he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Mercator,</hi> in the mean time, was expected by <hi>Flavilla</hi> with the moſt tender impatience. She had put her little boy to bed, and decorated a ſmall room in which they had been uſed to ſup by themſelves, and which ſhe had ſhut up in his abſence; ſhe counted the moments as they paſſed, and liſtened to every carriage and every ſtep that
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:029518_0125_0FE1CDCFC99C57A8"/>
ſhe heard. Supper was now ready. Her impatience was increaſed; terror was at length mingled with regret, and her fondneſs was only buſied to afflict her: ſhe wiſhed, ſhe feared, ſhe accuſed, ſhe apologized, and ſhe wept. In the height of theſe eager expectations, and this tender diſtreſs, ſhe received a billet which <hi>Mercator</hi> had been perſuaded by his uncle to write, in which he up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided her in the ſtrongeſt terms with abuſing his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and diſhonouring his bed: "Of this, he ſaid, he had now obtained ſufficient proof to do juſtice to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and that he was determined to ſee her no more."</p>
               <p>To thoſe whoſe hearts have not already acquainted them with the agony which ſeized <hi>Flavilla</hi> upon the ſight of the billet, all attempts to deſcribe it would not only be ineffectual, but abſurd. Having paſſed the night without ſleep, and the next day without food, diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in every attempt to diſcover what was become of <hi>Mercator,</hi> and doubting, if ſhe could have found h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>, whether it would be poſſible to convince him of her inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence: the violent agitation of her mind produced a ſlow fever, which, before ſhe conſidered as a diſeaſe, ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the child while ſhe cheriſhed it at her boſom, and wept over it as an orphan whoſe life ſhe was ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with her own.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Mercator</hi> had been abſent about ten days, his uncle, having perſuaded him to accompany ſome friends, to a country-ſeat at the diſtance of near ſixty miles, went to his lodgings in order to diſcharge the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The woman of the houſe, into whoſe hands ſhe had juſt put her repeating-watch and ſome other orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as a ſecurity for her rent, was ſo touched with her diſtreſs, and ſo firmly perſuaded of her innocence by the manner in which ſhe had addreſſed her, and the calm ſolemnity with which ſhe abſolved thoſe by whom ſhe had been traduced, that as ſoon as ſhe had diſcovered <hi>Fulvius's</hi> buſineſs, ſhe threw herſelf on her knees, and intreated, that if he knew where <hi>Mercator</hi> was to be found, he would urge him to return, that, if poſſible, the life of <hi>Flavilla</hi> might be preſerved, and the happineſs of both be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

The woman, as ſoon as ſhe obtained his promiſe, ran up and communicated it to <hi>Flavilla,</hi> who, when ſhe had recovered from the ſurpriſe and tumult which it occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned, was ſupported in her bed, and in about half an hour, after many efforts, and many intervals, wrote a ſhort billet, which was ſealed, and put into the hands of <hi>Fulvius.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Fulvius</hi> immediately incloſed and diſpatched it by the poſt, reſolving that in a queſtion ſo doubtful and of ſuch importance, he would no farther interpoſe. <hi>Mercator,</hi> who the moment he caſt his eye upon the letter, knew both the hand and ſeal, after pauſing a few moments in ſuſpence, at length tore it open, and read theſe words:</p>
               <p>"Such has been my folly, that perhaps I ſhould not be acquitted of guilt in any circumſtances but thoſe in which I write. I do not, therefore, but for your ſake, with them otherwiſe than they are. The dear infant, whoſe birth has undone me, now lies dead at my ſide, a victim to my indiſcretion and your reſentment.

               <p>
                  <hi>Mercator,</hi> whom an earthquake would leſs have affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than this letter, felt all his tenderneſs revive in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and reflected with unutterable anguiſh upon the raſhneſs of his reſentment. At the thought of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from <hi>London,</hi> he ſtarted as if he had felt a dagger in his heart: he lifted up his eyes to heaven, with a look that expreſſed at once an accuſation of himſelf, and a petition for her; and then ruſhing out of the houſe without taking leave of any, or ordering a ſervant to attend him, he took poſt-horſes in a neighbouring inn, and in leſs than ſix hours was in <hi>Leiceſter Fields.</hi> But notwithſtanding his ſpeed, he arrived too late; <hi>Flavilla</hi> had ſuffered the laſt agony, and her eyes could behold him no more. Grief and diſappointment, remorſe and

deſpair, now totally ſubverted his reaſon. It become neceſſary to remove him by force from the body, and after a confinement of two years in a mad-houſe, he died.</p>
               <p>May every lady on whoſe memory compaſſion ſhall record theſe events, tremble to aſſume the levity of <hi>Flavilla!</hi> for perhaps it is not in the power of any man in <hi>Mercator'</hi>s circumſtances to be leſs jealous than <hi>Mercator.</hi>

following true narrative may plead in my behalf to an injured woman, reconcile me to myſelf, and reſtore that tranquility of mind, which I have ſo lately forfeited by my own folly and indiſcretion.</p>
               <p>You muſt know that I am the ſon of an honeſt tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, was by him brought up at a public ſchool, and from thence went to the univerſity. Soon after my arrival there, a gentleman came down with his family to enter his ſon, who had been my ſchool-fellow, at one of the colleges: they ſent for me, and deſired I would ſhew them the univerſity; a requeſt which I readily complied with, as it gratified my vanity of being ſeen with his daughter, a young lady of great beauty and fortune; advantages which often ſupply the want of every other real good, but ſerved in her only to adorn the ſuperior qualities of the mind, and ſet off the charms of virtue.</p>
               <p>I ſtrove to make their time as agreeable as poſſible, by that aſſiduity which never fails to pleaſe, and all thoſe little ſervices which are ſure to conciliate affection: I united on my fair viſitor, as you may imagine, with more than ordinary diligence, gratified her curioſity by the fight of every thing that I thought worthy of her atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and endeavoured by being uſeful, to make myſelf agreeable. I ſucceeded ſo well, in ſhort, with the whole family, that when they left the place, I received a preſſing invitation from the father to ſpend a week with them in <hi>London.</hi> Accordingly I waited on them, and was received with great politeneſs; the morning we chiefly ſpent in diverſions within doors, and in the evening went to the play. This gave me an opportunity of frequent inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>views with the young lady, in which I could not help paying that tribute of praiſe to her accompliſhments which I know ſhe deſerved, and which I imagined ſhe expected; I ſpoke the language of love, without feeling the power of it, and inſenſibly raiſed a paſſion in her breaſt, which was yet a ſtranger to my own. Little did I indeed at that time imagine, that with an intention merely to amuſe, I was laying ſnares to deceive; and that whilſt I thought myſelf only playing the innocent Art of a fine gentleman, I was undermining the peace of an amiable woman, and deſtroying the future happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a whole family.</p>
               <p>When I took my leave, my friends told me they would
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:029518_0127_0FE1CDE41DA30D28"/>
not conſent to part with me ſo ſoon, unleſs I would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, on the firſt leiſure I had, to return; with which propoſal I readily acquieſced. As I had no great deſire to change a ſcene of gaiety and pleaſure for the gloom of a college, the reflection of it threw a melancholy on my features, which the lady attributed to a different cauſe. I fetched a deep ſigh at parting, and retired from her with a ſilent ſorrow, which I afterwards found had left a ſtronger impreſſion on her heart than all the fine things I had ſaid; and confirmed her in the opinion ſhe had conceived of my inviolable attachment to her. I returned to the univerſity, where my attention was ſoon called off to other views, and my thoughts fixed on ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of a different nature: nor ſhould I, perhaps, from that hour, have called to mind the now forgotten fair one, had not a letter, which I received from her about three months afterwards, greatly ſurpriſed and diſturbed me.</p>
               <p>"She would not, ſhe there informed me, have broken through the preſcribed forms of her ſex, but that, as ſhe well knew my deſigns were honourable, and nothing but my own diffidence had concealed them, ſhe looked on herſelf as bound in honour to let me know that it would be acceptable to her; and that it would appear like af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation in her to ſuppoſe I had meant merely to flatter and amuſe her; and as ſhe had ſpared me the confuſion of firſt mentioning this, ſhe hoped I would ſoon come to a more clear explanation." In a poſtſcript, ſhe added, "That her father was a man who had, what we call, ſeen the world, was determined to marry her at all events, up to her rank; and choſe rather to ſee her ſplendidly miſerable, than obſcurely happy: that unleſs I ſaved her, ſhe was ruined; and that a ſhort time muſt determine her late."</p>
               <p>I need not tell you how I was confounded to find myſelf involved in an intrigue, before I had ſo much as once ſeriouſly thought upon it; I therefore anſwered her in the moſt ſubmiſſive manner I could; repreſented to her, that it would be the higheſt ingratitude in me to marry the daughter of a man who had ſhewn me ſuch uncommon civilities, without his conſent; beſides, that the diſparity of our fortunes muſt be an unſurmountable object to a thinking perſon; that ſhe might one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> or other reproach me with breach of truſt herſelf, or inſult
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:029518_0127_0FE1CDE41DA30D28"/>
me on account of that very inequality which ſhe now ſeemed to diſregard; that, in ſuch a caſe, the deſire of pleaſing muſt ſink into the fear of offending, and thus put an end to all viſionary ſchemes of laſting happineſs; that I was ſorry ſhe had ſo miſtaken my behaviour as to attribute that to love which is but the effect of gallantry. I then talked to her of a prieſt and marriage in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of <hi>Lothario;</hi> and concluded by adviſing her, for both our ſakes, to think no more of it.</p>
               <p>This, you may imagine, was an anſwer, which, whilſt my hand wrote it, my heart very ſeverely reproached me for. I could not but tacitly blame myſelf for that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular regard and attachment to her which I had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly expreſſed, and was not determined, whether I ſhould not make a little ſerious love to her the very next opportunity; when, in the midſt of theſe reflections, I received the following letter, which beſt can tell the ſtory of her miſfortune, and expoſe the weakneſs of my paſt conduct.</p>
               <p>"It is over; and I am a ſlave! yet the only hour that I can call my own I give to you, the only one that a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's authority has no right to interrupt. To ſum up all my miſeries, in a word, know, my father has this morning given me up to ſorrow and Mr.—. Alas! what deluſive viſions of felicity did not your flattering tongue once give me leave to form! ſuch as no turn of fortune can again recal. I tremble to think what a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's rage may inflict, when he finds, inſtead of the happineſs he expected, ſo poor an entertainment as love compelled will afford him. It is impoſſible for different maſters to ſhare one poor heart. With me he may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy as much as the unwilling victim to brutal violence, and have as warm a return of fondneſs from the ſheeted dead. But what am I ſaying, and to whom? To him that has robbed me of my peace! can he now dry up thoſe tears which himſelf alone could bid to flow? Or can he heal thoſe wounds which himſelf has made? But the worſt is paſt; all the paſſions that have racked me ſince I received you laſt are huſhed; and what little ſpirit remains will ſoon give way to the ſilent eating ſorrow after this. Think that you have robbed me of what not all my fortune can purchaſe for me, nor the whole world beſide hath power to beſtow. Ever ſince I was taught to
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:029518_0128_0FE1CDE5BAE5FCD8"/>
form a wiſh, it was that of being a happy mother, and a tender wife. I may now have a child whom its father's vices will exclude from that exceſs of fondneſs which I would otherwiſe have poured over it; and you know too well his character to hope any alteration in him: and yet this man my religion henceforth binds me to be true to, and obey. Farewell! and know, however I condemn your conduct, that would my brother, jealous of this hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our as he is, this moment revenge me, I had rather for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give than reſent it. Live then, and be happy; and may that happineſs never be ſuſpended a moment by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of her whom your falſehood has made for ever miſerable."</p>
               <p>If your heart has not already informed you what I felt on this, it will be needleſs to tell you how ſeverely I now accuſe my own weak conduct; nor can I ſoon forgive myſelf the wanton ſacrifice of youth, innocence, beauty and virtue, to faſhionable levity, and polite perfidiouſneſs. It is I that have given the wound inflicted by her father a deeper ſmart, though it is himſelf who has made that miſery laſting. I can only wiſh this may be a uſeful leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to warn all young gentlemen, my fellow profligates, never to expreſs a particular regard where they have not ſerious thoughts of love; and to teach parents whom heaven has bleſt with dutiful children, rather to make them happy than great; or by their authority never to violate thoſe hearts which they have only a right to guide.</p>

wild berries nor a ſingle ſpring in this forlorn uninhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited deſart; and begging the protection of Heaven againſt the tygers that would now certainly deſtroy him, ſince he had conſumed the laſt fuel he had collected to make nightly fires to affright them. He then caſt a caſket of jewels on the ſand as trifles of no uſe; and crept feeble and trembling to an eminence, where he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to ſit every evening to watch the ſetting ſun, and to give a ſignal to any ſhip that might happily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the iſland.</p>
               <p>"Inhabitant of heaven, cried <hi>Bozaldab,</hi> ſuffer not this wretch to periſh by the fury of wild beaſts." "Peace, ſaid the angel, and obſerve."</p>
               <p>He looked again, and beheld a veſſel arrived at the deſolate iſle. What words can paint the rapture of the ſtarving merchant, when the captain offered to tranſport him to his native country, if he would reward him with half the jewels of his caſket. No ſooner had this pitiful commander received the ſtipulated ſum, than he held a conſultation with the crew, and they agreed to ſeize the remaining jewels, and leave the unhappy exile in the ſame helpleſs and lamentable condition in which they diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered him. He wept and trembled, intreated and implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in vain.</p>
               <p>"Will Heaven permit ſuch injuſtice to be practiſed?" exclaimed <hi>Bozaldab.</hi> "Look again, ſaid the angel, and behold the very ſhip in which, ſhort-ſighted as thou art, thou wiſhedſt the merchant might embark, daſhed in pieces on a rock: doſt thou not hear the cries of the ſinking ſailors?

diſtreſs has taught wiſdom! but turn thine ayes to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and more intereſting ſcene."—The Caliph inſtantly beheld a magnificent palace, adorned with ſtatues of his anceſtors wrought in jaſper; the ivory doors of which turning on hinges of the gold of <hi>Golconda,</hi> diſcovered a throne of diamonds, ſurrounded by the rajas of fifty na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and with ambaſſadors in various habits, and of different complexions; on which ſat <hi>Aboram,</hi> the much-lamented ſon of <hi>Bozaldab,</hi> and by his ſide a princeſs fairer than a Houri.</p>
               <p>"Gracious <hi>Alla!</hi>—It is my ſon! cried the Caliph, O let me hold him to my heart!" "Thou canſt not graſp an unſubſtantial viſion, replied the angel: I am now ſhewing thee what would have been the deſtiny of thy ſon, had he continued longer on the earth." "And why, returned <hi>Bozaldab,</hi> why was he not permitted to continue? Why was he not ſuffered to be a witneſs of ſo much felicity and power?" "Conſider the ſequel," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied he that dwells in the fifth heaven. <hi>Bozaldab</hi> looked earneſtly, and ſaw the countenance of his ſon, on which he had been uſed to behold the placid ſmile of ſimplicity, and the vivid bluſhes of health, now diſtorted with rage, and now fixed in the inſenſibility of drunkenneſs: it was again animated with diſdain, it became pale with apprehenſion, and appeared to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered with intemperance; his hands were ſtained with blood, and he trembled by turns with fury and terror. The palace ſo lately ſhining with Oriental pomp, changed ſuddenly into the cell of a dungeon, where his ſon lay ſtretched out on a cold pavement, gagged and bound, and his eyes put out. Soon after he perceived the favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite ſultana, who before was ſeated by his ſide, enter with a bowl of poiſon, which ſhe compelled <hi>Aboram</hi> to drink, and aftewards married the ſucceſſor to his throne.</p>
               <p>"Happy, ſaid <hi>Coloc,</hi> is he whom Providence has, by the angel of death, ſnatched from guilt! from whom that power is withheld, which, if he had poſſeſſed, would have accumulated upon himſelf yet greater miſery than it could have done upon others."</p>
               <p>"It is enough, cried <hi>Bozaldab;</hi> I adore the inſerntable ſchemes of omniſcience!—From what dreadful evils has my ſon been reſcued, by a death which I raſhly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed as unfortunate and premature! a death of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence

and peace, which has bleſſed his memory on earth, and tranſmitted his ſpirit to the ſkies."</p>
               <p>"Caſt away the dagger, replied the heavenly meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which thou waſt preparing to plunge into thine own heart. Exchange complaint for ſilence, and doubt for adoration. Can a mortal look down without giddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſtupefaction into the vaſt abyſs of eternal wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? Can a mind that ſees not infinitely, perfectly comprehend any thing among an infinity of objects mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually relative?

Remember, that perfect happineſs cannot be conferred on a creature; for perfect happineſs is an attribute as incommunicable as perfect power and eternity."</p>
               <p>The angel, while he was ſpeaking thus, ſtretched out his pinions to fly back to the empyreum, and the ſlutter of his wings was like the ruſhing of a cataract.</p>

Nothing can be <hi>honourable</hi> that is not <hi>virtuous:</hi> among the <hi>Romans,</hi> the entrance of the temple of <hi>honor</hi> always lay through the temple of <hi>virtue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Example is a leſſon all can read.</p>
               <p>No man can be ſaid to die ſuddenly who has lived long. If we do not govern our paſſions, we may be ſure our paſſions will govern us.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who are given to tell <hi>all</hi> they know, generally tell <hi>more</hi> than they know.</p>
               <p>The man who loves not praiſe, will ſcarce do any thing to deſerve it.</p>
               <p>We ſhould not talk to pleaſe ourſelves, but thoſe who hear us.</p>
               <p>Obſtinate people are never ſo much ſo, as when they are in the wrong.</p>
               <p>Of all brutes, none are ſo very brutiſh as <hi>human</hi> brutes.</p>
               <p>To pleaſe, we muſt reſemble the <hi>willow,</hi> and not the <hi>oak.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He who is <hi>fond</hi> of <hi>giving</hi> advice, wants it <hi>himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Advice ſhould fall as the <hi>dew,</hi> not overwhelm is a <hi>ſhower.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſometimes feel what we <hi>fear,</hi> much more than that we <hi>really ſuffer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hard to be <hi>pleaſed,</hi> and eaſy to be <hi>diſpleaſed,</hi> is an odious character.</p>
               <p>The meaneſt way of <hi>praiſing ourſelves</hi> is <hi>finding fault with others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The man who is aſhamed of being <hi>poor,</hi> would be <hi>proud</hi> if he were <hi>rich.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When we ſpeak of the <hi>dead,</hi> we ſhould tread ſoftly over their <hi>graves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Praiſe children for being <hi>pretty,</hi> and they will endeavour to be <hi>beautiful</hi> praiſe them for being <hi>good,</hi> and they will endeavour to he <hi>virtues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Avarice</hi> is of all characters the moſt oppoſite to that of the <hi>Almighty;</hi> whoſe alone it is to <hi>give,</hi> and not to <hi>receive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe who give no body a good word, deſerve no body's good word.</p>
               <p>An affected <hi>gravity</hi> that covers folly, is like a waſhed ſhilling that paſſes for a guinea, till it comes to be tried.</p>

                  <l>Too roughly kind to pleaſe a lady's ear;</l>
                  <l>Unlike the flatt'ries of a lover's pen,</l>
                  <l>Such truths as women ſeldom learn from men.</l>
                  <l>Nor think I praiſe you ill, when thus I ſhew</l>
                  <l>What female vanity might fear to know;</l>
                  <l>Some merit's mine, to dare to be ſincere,</l>
                  <l>But greater your's ſincerity to bear.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>Hard is the fortune that your ſex attends;</l>
                  <l>Women, like princes, find few real friends:</l>
                  <l>All who approach them, their own ends purſue,</l>
                  <l>Lovers and miniſters are never true.</l>
                  <l>Hence oft from reaſon, heedleſs beauty ſtrays,</l>
                  <l>And the moſt truſted guide the moſt betrays:</l>
                  <l>Hence by fond dreams of fancy'd pow'r amus'd,</l>

                  <l>For this hands, lips, and eyes are put to ſchool,</l>
                  <l>And each inſtructed feature has its rule:</l>
                  <l>And yet how few have learn'd, when this is given,</l>
