            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Newton, of Norwich.</note> Reply of the ſame Author, I think myſelf in ſome Degree obliged to appear a ſecond Time, ſtill further to ſhew, according to my Underſtanding, the Neceſſity, Univerſality and real Senſibility of the Work of God's Holy Spirit upon the immortal Soul of Man, as the vital Source, and Support of true Religion in him; and therefore the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Guide of his Life and Conduct.</p>
            <p>My Intention is not mere Controverſy, but Explanation and Doctrine. I have therefore taken the Liberty to uſe divers Expreſſions from the Apocrypha, and other writings, where their Pertinence and Clearneſs entitled them to a Place.</p>

I take little Notice of the numerous declamatory Parts of my Oppoſer's Performance. It concerns not the ingenuous Reader, who can be moſt keen or moſt petulent, but on which Side of the Queſtion the Truth lies, and by which Doctrine his Mind is moſt likely to be beſt and moſt profitably informed. This he may better judge for himſelf, than others for him; for be they ever ſo ingenious, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe learned, they cannot be competent Judges in Things they have not experienced, and which are not to be known but by Experience.</p>
            <p>I have no Animoſity towards my Antagoniſt; but his Work appears to me founded in Miſtakes, both concerning the Senſe of Scripture, and the Intention of our Writings. To proceed minutely to unravel and clear, what he has been at ſo much Pains to perplex and confuſe, would be more tedious than difficult, and could by no Means com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate either for the Reader's Time or my own. My firſt Endeavour therefore ſhall be, to ſhew the Verity of our true leading Principles, from the original, and preſent State of Mankind, with the Aſſiſtance requiſite thereunto, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to add ſome Remarks upon divers Parts of the Treatiſe before me.</p>

            <div n="1" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>1.</hi> Man was originally created in Purity, and in a State of due Order and Rectitude. <hi>2.</hi> He was inſpired with a Senſe of his Duty; and <hi>3</hi> and <hi>4,</hi> impowered to perform it. <hi>5.</hi> Being tempted, he lapſed from his proper Guard, the preſerving Power of God, into Sin. <hi>6.</hi> He fell from the Image of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, into the Image of the Earthly. How unlawful Self roſe in him. <hi>7.</hi> That he really ſuffered Death in Spirit, in the Day of his Tranſgreſſion. What the Life and Death of the Soul are.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. IN the Beginning God created all Things good. Inherently and immutably good himſelf, every Production of his muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be ſo, according to the ſeveral Kinds wherein he created them. As Man was wholly made by him, he muſt have been made wholly good; his Nature clear of all Impurity, and free from all Defect and Diſorder. His Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:021391_0006_0FB3690E2346E628"/>were not imperfect, but limited to their proper Sphere, and every Part of his Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition conſtituted in its due Rectitude; the Body placed in Subſervience to his rational Spirit, or Soul, as to the more noble and excellent, and therefore the ſuperior Part, made for Immortality, and in Subjection only to the Guidance of its Creator.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The human Faculties, or Powers of Capacity, muſt then be clear, unprejudiced, and fit to receive Impreſſions, yet void of any but thoſe of immediate Senſe. Man, merely as Man, could not originally bring any real Knowledge into the World with him. That muſt either be immediately communicated to him by his Maker, or afterwards acquired by himſelf, through Obſervation and Experience. The latter required Time to effect; and as it was requiſite to his Situation, that he ſhould be immediately endued with ſuch an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of himſelf, and his Creator, as related to his preſent Duty, and affected his Felicity, he certainly was, by Divine Wiſdom and Goodneſs, timely furniſhed with it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Man muſt not only <hi>then</hi> be ſupplied with a due Degree of Light and Underſtanding, but he muſt alſo be impowered to act up to it, elſe his Knowledge would have been afforded him in vain. Yet, though he certainly was thus impowered, the Sequel manifeſted he was placed in a State of Probation, otherwiſe, he could never have been guilty of the leaſt Failure; for his Maker being eſſentially and unchangeably good, muſt have fixed him in a State of immutable Virtue and Goodneſs, had be determined to fix him at all.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="3" facs="unknown:021391_0007_0FB3690F23A66760"/>
4. As the omniſcient Creator moſt certainly foreſaw what a ſubtle Adverſary Man would have to encounter, he as ſurely furniſhed him with Means ſufficient to diſcover his Snares, and reſiſt his Aſſaults. If Satan was ſuffered to uſe his Subtlety and Influence to deceive him, doubtleſs he was not only warned, but alſo endued with a Sufficiency of Divine Light and Influence to withſtand his Attempts, as he kept duly upon his Watch.</p>
               <p>Nothing but the Divine Nature can enable any intelligent Creature to reſiſt Temptation, and act up to the Divine Will. If therefore any created Being is required to keep up there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, it muſt be aſſiſted by Divine Power ſo to do. God created Man for a Purpoſe of his own Glory. To glorify God, and to partake of his Glory, Man muſt walk in Obedience to his Will. Man could neither infallibly know his Will, nor conſtantly perform it, merely by the Strength of his own Faculties; he muſt therefore, neceſſarily have been aſſiſted by the Spirit of God, to enable him to perform his Will, and ſo to obey him as to glorify him, and enjoy a bleſſed Inheritance in him; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the End of Man's Creation could not be anſwered. Hence it is concluded, the firſt Man <hi>Adam</hi> was made a <hi>living Soul</hi> by the Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> Chriſt, who is a <hi>quickening Spirit;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. xv. 45, 46.</note> for <q>that was not firſt which is ſpiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is ſpiritual.</q> That is, <hi>Adam</hi> was firſt created a natural Man, and then rendered a ſpiritual One by the quickening Power of the Spirit of Chriſt, which is the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:021391_0008_0FB3691160D2D8E8"/>true Life, and proper Element for immortal Spirits to live and move in.</p>
               <p>Thus the Parents of Mankind, in their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal uncorrupted State, being fit Temples for the Holy Ghoſt to dwell in, were, as well as the Sanctified in Chriſt afterwards, <hi>Partakers of the Divine Nature,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Pet. i. 4.</note> by the internal quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening of Divine Life. The Author of the Book of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> obſerves,<note place="margin">Wiſd. vii.</note> that <hi>Wiſdom in all Ages,</hi> and certainly in the firſt and pureſt, <hi>entereth Holy Souls:</hi> Which Wiſdom he deſcribes to be <hi>the Breath of the Power of God, a pure Influence flowing from the Glory of the Almighty, the Brightneſs of the everlaſting Light, the unſpotted Mirrour of the Power of God, and the Image of his Goodneſs.</hi> This clearly denotes the Spirit of the eternal Son of God himſelf, and evidently concurs with thoſe Parts of the New Teſtament which declare him to be,<note place="margin">1 Cor. i. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>the Power of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. i. 15.</note> and <hi>the Wiſdom of God,</hi>

                  <hi>the true Light, and Life of Men,<note place="margin">2 Cor. iv. 4.</note> the Brightneſs of the Father's Glory, and the Image of the inviſible God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was undoubtedly in the Light of this <hi>pure Influence</hi> that <hi>Adam</hi> had ſuch an intuitive Diſcerning of the Creation, as enabled him to give Names to them according to their ſeveral Natures.<note place="margin">Gen. ii. 19.</note> For we read, <q>The Lord God formed every Beaſt of the Field, and every Fowl of the Air, and brought them unto <hi>Adam,</hi> to ſee what he would call them; and whatſoever <hi>Adam</hi> called every living Creature that was the Name thereof.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Under this celeſtial Enduement, the ſcared Impreſſion of the Divine Image conſpicuouſly appeared in the firſt of Mankind.<note place="margin">Gen. i. 27.</note> 
                  <q>In the Image of God created he them.</q>

5. Had Man kept in faithful Obedience to his Heavenly Guide, and rejected the Efforts of the Tempter, he might undoubtedly, in due Time, have been advanced to a Degree of Eſtabliſhment beyond all Poſſibility of falling; but not continuing ſtrictly upon his Watch, and, contrary to the Warning before given him, turning his Attention towards the Temptation, when alluringly preſented, he ſlipped from his proper Guard; leaving hold of that Spirit wherein his Life and Strength lay, he fell from it, and all its Advantages, out of the Liberty of the Sons of God, into the Bondage of Corruption: A ſure Introduction to Miſery. For as Holineſs and Happineſs are inſeparably united, ſo Sin and Miſery are indiviſibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected.</p>
               <p>To ſuppoſe, that the Almighty Author of all Good, originally ſubjected Man under a moral Neceſſity to tranſgreſs upon the Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Temptation, is an Imagination too injurious to the Divine Character to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Our firſt Parents were unqueſtionably enabled by their Maker to abide in due Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, which would have entitled them to Preſervation; their Defection from which, was certainly not of him, but of themſelves. Had their Lapſe been thro' his Will, or intentional Diſpoſition of Circumſtances, ſo that it muſt inevitably follow, he could not conſiſtently have ſentenced them to Puniſhment for it; becauſe in ſo doing, they performed his Will, which could not be a Sin againſt him.</p>
               <p>A dangerous Fondneſs to become knowing in Things hurtful, and no Way neceſſary, ſeems to have an early Entrance into the human
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:021391_0010_0FB36914F04AA7D8"/>Mind.<note place="margin">Gen. iii. 5.</note> 
                  <q>In the Day ye eat, your Eyes ſhall be opened, and ye ſhall be as Gods, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Good and Evil.</q> By the Suggeſtion of this flattering Falthood, <hi>Eve</hi> was deceived. Knowing nothing but Good, ſhe might have remained happy; but experiencing Evil, ſhe became otherwiſe. This Knowledge is as oppoſite to that of the Divine Wiſdom, as Darkneſs is to Light. It is certain the Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcient knows both Good and Evil, but he knows the firſt by immutable Poſſeſſion, and perfect Enjoyment, and the laſt he beholds with Abhorrence, in eternal Oppoſition to, and infinite Diſtance from the Purity of his Nature. With ſinful Man the Caſe is reverſe, Evil having immediate Poſſeſſion of him, and Good being out of his Reach, without divine Mercy, he muſt be completely wretched. This is the neceſſary Conſequence of that boaſted Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the World, which Men acquire by taſting the pernicious and poiſonous Sweets of Temptation.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Conſequences of this primary Lapſe were immediately affecting to the actual Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors, and remotely to all their Poſterity. 1. They loſt the bright Impreſſion of the Divine Image, and the Felicity attending it. Forfeiting the immediate indwelling and pure Influence of GOD's Holy Spirit, they loſt that Divine Similitude, wherein they had enjoyed internal Light, Life, Love, Goodneſs, Righteouſneſs, Holineſs, and Happineſs. That omnipreſent Spirit of Power, Truth and Virtue, which in their original State had been their Comforter, diſunited from them through Tranſgreſſion, now became their Accuſer and

Thus probably inordinate Self-love and Self-will originated in Man, and they always ſtand in a Will ſeparate from the Will of God, and a Spirit contrary to his Holy Spirit. This mental Separation opened an eaſy Road of Acceſs for the Evil Spirit to influence the human Mind towards exterior Objects, and rendered them the Subjects of Temptation. By giving way to carnal Inclinations, Man became carnally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded, and "to be carnally-minded <hi>is Death."</hi>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. IT appears from holy Writ, that previous to our own actual Offences, we are all naturally affected by the Tranſgreſſion of our Primo-genitors. <q>By one Man,<note place="margin">Rom. v. 12.</note> Sin entered into the World, and Death by Sin, ſo Death paſſed upon all Men, for that all have ſinned</q> This is not to be underſtood of the Death of the Body only; for all come into the World in the Image of the earthly, or, void of the quickening and ſenſible Influence of Divine Life. But this Diſadvantage, through the Supreme Goodneſs, is amply provided for, and there appears no Neceſſity to conclude, that we all come into the World juſtly obnoxious to Divine Vengeance, for an Offence committed by our Primo-genitors, before we came into the World. With what Propriety can an Infant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of committing any Crime, be treated as an Offender? The Scripture poſitively aſſures us,<note place="margin">Ezek. xviii.</note>

               <p n="2">2. The immortal reaſonable Soul of Man, in every Individual, appears to be the immediate Production of its Creator; for the Prophet <hi>Zechariah,</hi> ſpeaking of the great Acts of God in Creation,<note place="margin">Zech. xii. 1.</note> aſſerts, that <q>he formeth the Spirit of Man within him.</q> And in <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> xii. 7. we read upon the Death of the Body, <q>Then ſhall the Duſt return to the Earth as it was, and the Spirit ſhall return unto God who gave it.</q> The Soul therefore, receiving its Exiſtence immediately from the Perfection of unchangeable Purity, can have no original Impurity or Intemperature in its Nature; but being immediately and intimately connected with a ſenſitive Body, and of itſelf, unable conſtantly to withſtand the Eagerneſs of the animal Paſſions after Gratifications of a carnal Nature, is liable to be ſo influenced by them, as to partake with them in their ſenſual Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies. In this State the Deſcendants of <hi>Adam</hi> come into the World, unendued with that divine Life which <hi>Adam</hi> fell from. And who can ſay, this might not be admitted in Mercy to all the future Generations of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind? Iſt. That each ſucceding Individual might be prevented from incurring the Guilt of repeating the Sin of our prime Anceſtors, and falling from the ſame Degree of Innocence, Purity and Divine Enjoyment. 2d. That, by feeling the Infirmity of our own Nature, and the Want of Divine Aſſiſtance, we might
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:021391_0015_0FB3692176A960B0"/>become the more ſenſible of our Danger, and neceſſary Dependence on our Creator, and thence be continually excited to ſeek after, and cleave to him, in Watchfulneſs, Circumſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Prayer, in order to obtain a State of Reſtoration. 3d. That having in Part attained ſuch a State, our Prudence might be uſeful towards our Preſervation and Growth therein; ſince we ſhould certainly be more aſſidiouſly concerned, to ſecure to ourſelves a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, obtained through Pains and Difficulty, than one we might have been originally placed in without any Care or Trouble to ourſelves.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whatever were the Peculiarities attending the Fall of the firſt Man and Woman, or thoſe conſequent upon it, this is certain, that their Progeny do not come into the World in that ſame State of Brightneſs themſelves were conſtituted in after their Creation. It cannot eſcape the Notice of thoſe who have had the Care of Infants, that the earlieſt Exertions obſervable in them, evidently ariſe from the Powers of animal Deſire, and animal Paſſion; how prone theſe are to increaſe in them, and to predominate as they grow up, and the Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude it requires to keep Children out of Unrulineſs and Intemperature, as they advance to Youth's Eſtate; how much too potent their inordinate Propenſities are for the Government of the rational Faculty; what Pains are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to regulate, and often but to paliate them, by a virtuous Education, and improving Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe; and the Impoſſibility they ſhould ever be radically ſubdued and ruled, without the Application of a ſuperior Principle.</p>

4. In the preſent State of our Nature, the ſenſitive Powers take the Lead of the rational in the firſt Stage of Life, as the Soul brings only a Capacity, without any real Knowledge, or Potency, into the World with it. It acquires its Knowledge by Degrees, enlarging alſo in Capacity to receive it gradually. Every one knows, it is not capable at five or ten Years of Age, to comprehend the ſame Ideas in the ſame Extent, as in riper and more advanced Years. It firſt becomes impreſſed with the Images of external Things, preſented through the corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Organs, and afterwards with thoſe mental Ideas inculcated by its primary Inſtructors, whether true or ſalſe. Hence the Bias of Education becomes ſtrong, either to Right or Wrong, according as the Inſtructions received are agreeable to either, and the Paſſions being inliſted in their Service, occaſionally exerciſe their Warmth in Favour of the prevalent Idea, or Impreſſion, however wrong it may be; unleſs the Mind, through Divine Illumination, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover its Error, and ſubmit to its Rectification.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Previous to the Reception of Knowledge, the Soul is joined to the Body, by the Power of its Creator, who, in Conſequence of the Fall,<note place="margin">Rom. viii. 20, 21.</note> ſaw fit it ſhould be ſo. "For," ſaith the Apoſtle, <q>the Creature was made ſubject to Vanity, not willingly, but by Reaſon of him who hath ſubjected the ſame in Hope; becauſe the Creature itſelf alſo ſhall be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the Bondage of Corruption, into the glorious Liberty of the Children of God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The rational Soul is here intended by <hi>the Creature,</hi> and properly denominates the Man.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:021391_0017_0FB3692685158768"/>Herein the true Diſtinction lies, betwixt the human Species and Creatures of inferior Kinds. This deſcends not with the Body, from Parents to Children; the Soul being an indiviſible im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material Subſtance, cannot be generated. The Soul of the Child never was in the Parent, and therefore could never ſin in him, nor derive Guilt from his Tranſgreſſion. Neither can Guilt accrue to it, merely from its being joined to a Body deſcended from him, becauſe that Junction is the Act of the Creator.</p>
               <p>To account a Child guilty, or obnoxious to Puniſhment, merely for an Offence committed by its Parents, before it could have any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of Being, is inconſiſtent both with Juſtice and Mercy; therefore no Infant can be born with Guilt upon its Head.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. WHATEVER we may have derived from our Parents, we certainly accumulate to ourſelves additional Corruption. <q>All Fleſh hath corrupted his Way upon the Earth.<note place="margin">Gen. vi. 12</note>
                  </q> Every adult Perſon, in his common natural State, muſt, upon ſerious Introverſion, find in himſelf a Proneneſs to the Gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Self,</hi> and the <hi>ſenſual Part,</hi> an eager Inclination at Times to forbidden Pleaſure, an Averſion to Piety and Holy Walking, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of Guilt, and a fearful Apprehenſion of the Approach of Death. Men generally confeſs they have erred and ſtrayed, like loſt Sheep, from the ſalutary Paths of Virtue and Duty, and that, ſuch is their Frailty, it is an eaſy Thing for them to fall in with Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but hard, if not impoſſible, effectually
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:021391_0019_0FB36932D705C4B0"/>to reſiſt it. Nay, even the high Rewards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to Virtue and a good Life, and the ſore Puniſhments annexed to Vice and Folly, are altogether inſufficient to retain them in the Practice of the former, or to enable them to conquer the Force of their Inclination to the latter. This demonſtrates the Corruption of their Nature; and,<note place="margin">Mat. xii. 34.</note> as <q>out of the Abudance of the Heart, the Mouth ſpeaketh;</q> ſo from what lodges or preſides within, the exterior Practice ariſes. The Corruption in the Heart corrupts the Actions, Manners, and Language. Hence all the Irregularities in Conduct, all the prophane and untrue Speeches, all the common complimental Falſhoods, to gratify the Pride and Folly of vain Minds.</p>
               <p>As the Origin of Evil in Man, came by transferring his Attention and Deſire from his Creator to the Creature, dividing his Will from the Will of God, and his Spirit from the Spirit of God; ſo the Continuation of Evil in Man is by the Continuance of this Separation, and muſt abide ſo long as that remains. In this Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, commonly called <hi>the State of Nature,</hi> we are both unfit for, and unable to enter the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Kingdom,<note place="margin">Eph. v. 5.</note> which admits of <hi>nothing ſinful</hi> or <hi>unclean.</hi> It is therefore abſolutely requiſite that Man ſhould be made Holy, in order to be happy. Holineſs cannot unite with Unholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; nor can Ability ariſe from Infirmity. If Pollution can cleanſe itſelf, if Evil can produce Good, if Death can bring forth Life; Man thus corrupted, debilitated and deadened, may diſengage, reform, quicken, and reſtore him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. But it is not in the Power of Man, as ſuch, to extricate himſelf from the Bonds of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:021391_0020_0FB36934A226DBE0"/>Sin and Death. Yet, as Impurity is the Bar, it muſt be removed.<note place="margin">Iſa. lix. 2.</note> As <hi>Sin ſeparates Man from his Maker,</hi> Man muſt be ſeparated from Sin, or he cannot be reconciled, and united to him. Without Reſtoration to a State of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he cannot enjoy the Felicity pertaining to that State;<note place="margin">Heb. xii. 14.</note> for, <q>without Holineſs no Man ſhall ſee the Lord.</q>
               </p>
               <p>How then ſhall corrupt Man become Holy? How ſhall he, in a State of utter Incapacity, enter into and maintain a Warfare againſt his many and mighty Adverſaries, which beſet him within and without? What Ability has he to fight his Enemy who is already enchained by him? A Power too ſtrong for Man has got Poſſeſſion; it muſt be a ſuperior Power to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs him, to reſcue and reſtore Man; and who is ſufficient for theſe Things? None but his <hi>Omnipotent Creator</hi> was able to unbind and extricate him. But <hi>his Will Adam</hi> had ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from, <hi>his Law</hi> he had tranſgreſſed, <hi>his Command</hi> he had diſobeyed, and againſt <hi>him alone</hi> he had committed this high Offence. Yet, behold the aſtoniſhing Compaſſion and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of infinite Goodneſs! An all-ſufficient Means was ſtraightway provided, for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption both of the actual Offenders and all their Progeny. The eternal Word, the Son, the Lamb of God Almighty, gave inſtant Demonſtration of the Greatneſs of Divine Love and Mercy, in then concurring with the Father, to yield himſelf up in due Time to take <hi>the Nature of Man upon him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid ii. 16.</note> and, by reſigning it to Suffering and Death, to make it a Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation for the whole Species; and alſo, in immediately,<note place="margin">1 Cor. xii. 7.</note> and all along, affording <hi>a Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:021391_0021_0FB369362466B5D8"/>of his Holy Spirit to every Man to profit withal,</hi> in order to their preſent Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from the Power of Sin, and their everlaſting Salvation from the certain Effect of abiding therein to the laſt, namely, the ſecond Death.</p>
               <p>That Man ſhould, of himſelf, empower him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to live in the conſtant Practice of croſſing his natural Inclinations and Propenſities, is a wild Preſumption; but that a Spirit infinitely good, and more powerful than all his Enemies, ſhould ſo influence, incline, and enable him, is highly reaſonable to believe, becauſe abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary. By the Help of God's Spirit, Man may, like the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">1 Cor. ix. 27.</note> be aſſiſted to <hi>keep his Body under,</hi> and <hi>bring it into Subjection,</hi> before the Strength of its Paſſions and Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions leſſen by Decay of Nature; which the rational Faculty can never effectually accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh, even under that Decay, without ſuperior Aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Neither the Poſſibility, nor Probability, of Man's Purification and Sanctification by the Holy Spirit, can reaſonably be doubted; for, <hi>Firſt,</hi> as phyſical Evil, or bodily Pain, has no <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> Exiſtence of its own, but is purely <hi>incidental</hi> to corporeal Nature; ſo <hi>moral Evil</hi> is to the Soul, a Diſorder which it has impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly lapſed into. It is no Part of God's Creation, nor has any real Exiſtence by itſelf; but is the fallen, defective, diſtempered Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Beings, once created without Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature, or Defect. Evil therefore, though it be in Man, is no conſtituent Part of Man, but an Imperfection adventitious to his Nature, which by an all-powerful Principle, he may
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:021391_0022_0FB36938C16B6B28"/>be recovered from, and his Nature reſtored to a State of Fitneſs for Union with his Maker. <hi>Secondly,</hi> uncreated Omnipotence is certainly more able to cleanſe, than the creaturely, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, and fallen Powers of Darkneſs are to defile; and Infinite Goodneſs muſt be as willing and ready to effect the firſt, as limited Envy the laſt. Did not the Sovereign Lord intend Man ſhould be made Holy, he would not require it; nor would he require it without affording him the Aſſiſtance requiſite to accompliſh it, for he enjoins no Impoſſibilities. That he doth require it, the ſacred Writings ſufficiently wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. "God,"<note place="margin">1 Theſ. iv. 7.</note> ſaith an apoſtolic Writer, <q>hath not called us unto Uncleanneſs, <hi>but unto Holineſs.</hi>

It is always requiſite that the Means be adequate to the End, the Cauſe ſufficient to the Effect; therefore, as all Men throughout all Nations, and every Generation, originally ſtand in equal Relation to their Creator, have been, and muſt naturally be, in abſolute Need of his Help, in order to Purification and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, the Means afforded for this Purpoſe muſt be <hi>univerſal</hi> to reach all. It muſt be a Principle of real and powerful Holineſs and Goodneſs, to change the Condition of Man, from Evil to Good. It muſt be Omnipotent, to enable him to overcome his Adverſaries, the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil. Nothing but a Spirit ſuperior to all theſe can effectually cleanſe the Soul, and operate to the Expulſion, and Excluſion of thoſe ſubtil and powerful Enemies which continually ſeek to hold Men in the Bondage of Corruption; therefore nothing but God's Holy, Univerſal, Almighty Spirit can effect this neceſſary Alteration in Man, rectify the Diſorder Sin has introduced into his Nature, and raiſe him up from a State of ſpiritual Death, by producing a new and Heavenly Birth of Divine Life in him, by which he may be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated anew in Chriſt Jeſus unto good Works, and reſtored to the Image of God in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and true Holineſs.</p>

All exterior Forms, however miſtakenly exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or celebrated amongſt Mankind, are but outward and viſible Signs, and altogether inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual towards any real Change or Reformation of the Subject.

The vital Part of Man's Religion and Duty ſtands, principally, in a right Attention to, and a faithful Obedience of the Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit of Chriſt in the Heart and Conſcience.

For who is a Servant of Chriſt but he that willingly obeys him? Is he who willingly acts according to his <hi>verbal Precepts,</hi> a Follower of Chriſt; and is not he who, without the Knowledge <hi>of theſe,</hi> with equal Willingneſs follows <hi>the Leadings of his Spirit,</hi> alſo his Servant? Of this Spirit the truly
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:021391_0030_0FB3694BE76DDF40"/>Virtuous and Religious amongſt the Gentiles were,<note place="margin">Rom. ii. 14, 15.</note> in Degree, Partakers; "For," ſaith Holy Writ, <q>when the Gentiles which have not the Law, do by Nature the Things contained in the Law, theſe, having not the Law, are a Law unto themſelves; which ſhew the Work of the Law written in their Hearts, their Conſcience alſo bearing Witneſs, and their Thoughts the mean While accuſing or elſe excuſing one another.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Words <hi>by Nature</hi> here, I apprehend, are not to be underſtood as if the Apoſtle intended the Gentiles became virtuous by any Goodneſs in <hi>their fallen Nature,</hi> which muſt be the ſame as all other Mens. The Context ſhews, he was here diſtinguiſhing between thoſe who enjoyed the Miniſtration of the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Law, and thoſe who had it not; and he uſeth the Expreſſion, <hi>by Nature,</hi> in the ſame Senſe as if he had ſaid, <hi>without an Education under the Law,</hi> and proceeds to ſhew, that though they had it not, yet they practiſed the Subſtance intended by the Law. This ſhewed not, that their own Hearts were their Law, but as the Apoſtle explains it, that <hi>the Work of the Law was written in their Hearts,</hi> and that they had a Part in the New Covenant, in Reference to which it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Jer. xxxi. 33.</note> 
                  <q>I will put my Law in their inward Parts, and write it in their Hearts.</q> Though they were without the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> they were not without Law to God. For, by receiving and retaining the Divine Impreſſions in their Conſciences, they were under the Law to Chriſt, or ſubject to the Manifeſtation of his Spirit in their Hearts, and in Proportion to their Obedience, Partakers
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:021391_0031_0FB3694F0C4EECB8"/>of <hi>the Nature of the Divine Principle</hi> within them. By the internal Operation of <hi>this Nature</hi> it was that they became reformed in Heart, and rectified in Life and Practice, ſo far as they were ſo; or as the Text has it, enabled <q>to do the Things contained in the Law.</q> Originally diſordered, and actually depraved, <hi>their own Nature</hi> as Men could never have led and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered them to this; for, ſince the primary Lapſe, <hi>it is prone to Evil,</hi>

                  </gap>erſally ſown in every Heart, by the great and good Huſbandman for that End. Were it not for the Notices and Powers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by this internal Principle, Man muſt have continued to proceed in the Increaſe of Corruption, Irreligion and Miſery; as appears too evidently by the Conduct of ſuch as diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it. Not by following <hi>their own Nature</hi> therefore, but by Obedience to the inward Law of <hi>the Divine Nature</hi> written in the Heart, the conſcientiouſly Virtuous amongſt the Gentiles, as well as others, were enabled to perform the Things, or <hi>juſt Morals</hi> contained in the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Law, and thereby to evidence in their Meaſures, the effectual Operation and Authority of the Divine Lawgiver within them.</p>
               <p>The Gentiles therefore partaking of the Law written in the Heart, cannot properly be ſaid to be excluded from all Share in the New Covenant, or Diſpenſation of the Goſpel. The Goſpel, taken in its full Extent, is the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Love and Mercy, and the Offer and Operation of the Grace of God, through
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:021391_0032_0FB3695239405388"/>Chriſt, to fallen Man in his natural and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible State, in order to his Reſtoration and Salvation. It is not wholly contracted into the <hi>more Tidings;</hi> but, including theſe, goes deeper, and <hi>eſſentially</hi> conſiſts in the Thing declared by them;<note place="margin">Ibid i. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>the Power of God adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered to the Salvation of the Soul.</hi> By this the outward Coming of Chriſt is rendered truly and fully effectual to each Individual. Thoſe who believe in, and obey him in his inward and ſpiritual Manifeſtations, by which the Goſpel is preached in every rational Creature under Heaven, may come to be Partakers of his Life, and be ſaved by him from the ſecond Death of eternal Miſery, though providentially incapacitated to know the exterior Hiſtory of his Incarnation, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>That virtuous and devout Gentiles were approved of God, appears in the Caſe of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius,</hi> for we find that before his Reception of hiſtorical and verbal Chriſtianity,<note place="margin">Acts x. 2, 3, 4.</note> his ſincere Devotion, and Reverence towards his Creator, and charitable Acts to the Needy, <q>came up for a Memorial before God,</q> who alſo now taught <hi>Peter,</hi> Verſe 15, the Gentiles he had thus cleanſed were no more to be eſteemed <hi>common</hi> or <hi>unclean</hi> than the believing <hi>Jews,</hi> and gave him,<note place="margin">Ibid 34, 35.</note> 
                  <hi>of a Truth,</hi> to perceive, <q>that <hi>God is no Reſpecter of Perſons:</hi> but in every Nation, he that ſeareth him, and worketh Righteouſneſs, is accepted with him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it appears, thoſe who conſcientiouſly obey the ſpiritual Manifeſtations of Chriſt in them, are internally, though not by outward Profeſſion, his Diſciples and Followers, and truly believe in him ſo far as he is revealed to
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:021391_0033_0FB36955234E77A8"/>them; for Obedience is the certain Proof of a right Faith. And I make no Queſtion, but thoſe in any Part of the Globe, who, from invincible Obſtacles, have not the Opportunity of hiſtorical Chriſtianity, in their Obedience to the ſpiritual Appearance of Chriſt in their Hearts, are accepted, and partake of the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of his Death. Why ſhould they not be as capable of receiving Advantage by the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſt, as Diſadvantage by the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> whilſt they are equally Strangers to the Hiſtory of both? But certainly, thoſe to whom the ſacred Writings are providentially com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, are under double Obligation, ſince they are favoured with that additional inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Advantage; and it will tend to their greater Condemnation, if they believe not unto Obedience. For, however high the Profeſſion of ſuch may be, they are but imperfect, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial, ineffectual Believers, who hold with the external Part, and experience not the internal: Chriſtians <hi>in Name,</hi> but <hi>not in Deed</hi> and <hi>in Truth.</hi> It is eſſential to us who have the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to believe both in the outward Coming, and inward Miniſtration of our Saviour, reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, and truſting in him, with that Faith of the Operation of God, which works by Love to the Purification of the Heart, and is the ſaving Faith of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Complete Chriſtianity has both an Inſide and an Outſide; a Profeſſion or bodily Appearance, and a Life and Virtue, which is as a Soul to that Body. Thoſe who are in Poſſeſſion of both, are complete Chriſtians. Thoſe who have the inward Part without the outward, though incomplete in that Reſpect, will, in
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:021391_0034_0FB36957228C1DC0"/>the Sight of perfect Equity, certainly be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to ſuch as have the latter without the former; and it would be well for all who have the Hiſtory, and profeſs the Chriſtian Religion, yet walk contrary to its Requirings, could they change Conditions at laſt with ſuch conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Gentiles. Let thoſe who are ſo deeply affected with Abſurdity, as to believe or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that Infinite Wiſdom, Goodneſs and Equity, has confined Salvation to ſuch of his Creatures as happen, without any Choice of their own, to inhabit particular Spots of the Globe, are formalized after a peculiar Manner, or entertain one particular Set of Articles and Opinions, let ſuch duly conſider the following Texts.<note place="margin">Mat. viii. 10, 11, 12.</note>

The ſame Power that cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, requiſite to the Support of his Creation, and his continual Superintendance neceſſary to Mankind.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. MANKIND are not left to Satan, nor to their own Luſts, nor to live without God in the World. A Way is caſt up. A Means is provided. Beſides the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and traditional Conſciouſneſs of mere moral Good and Evil in every Breaſt, God hath a Divine Witneſs in the Heart of each Individual, which will truly manifeſt Right and Wrong in the Conſciences of thoſe who faithfully attend thereunto, afford Light and Power to ſet them free from the Miſts of Prepoſſeſſion and Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, and become to them a ſafe Conductor, and an able Supporter in the Paths of Religion and Virtue.</p>
               <p>What Inſtructor can we have equal to this moſt intimate Witneſs? A Monitor ſo near, ſo conſtant, ſo faithful, ſo infallible! This is the
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:021391_0040_0FB3696562EDBA08"/>great Goſpel-privilege of every Man: The Advantage of having it preached Day by Day in his own Heart, without Money, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Price, yet with Certainty. Is it reaſonable to conclude, this nice, true, and awful Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerner, ſhould be leſs than Divine? Can any Perſon, upon ſerious Conſideration, imagine it to be the Nature of the fallen Man himſelf? Is there the leaſt Probability that any Thing ſo corrupted and clouded, ſhould ſo clearly and inſtantly diſtinguiſh, and would the Heart of Man, which is declared by Inſpiration to be <hi>deceitful above all Things,<note place="margin">Jer. xvii. 9.</note> and deſperately wicked,</hi> ſo faithfully reprove itſelf? Would that which delights in its own Indulgence, and is impatient of Reſtraint, act in daily Control to its own Inclinations? Is it the Property of Evil to do Good? Here is a juſt Criterion. That which is natural, leads according to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; that which is ſpiritual according to the Spirit. Theſe are diſtinguiſhed in Scripture by the Terms <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. vii. 23.</note> and are truly ſaid to war againſt each other in Man.<note place="margin">Gal. v. 17.</note> As Sin wars againſt the Spirit to deſtroy the Soul, the Spirit wars againſt Sin to ſave the Soul.</p>
               <p>Let me query with you, who, inſtead of embracing in Humility, Love, and Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, this upright Principle <hi>as Divine,</hi> are exerting your Abilities to depreciate and revile it. Whilſt you confeſs it diſtinguiſhes Right from Wrong in your own Breaſts, by its Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the firſt, and rebuke of the laſt; can you thus acknowledge it to be infallibly Good, and at the ſame Time attribute it to yourſelves? "I know,"<note place="margin">Rom. vii. 18.</note> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 
                  <q>that in me, that is in my Fleſh,"(or belonging to my Nature)

Is there <hi>any</hi> good Thing in yours, yet was there <hi>none</hi> in his? He confeſſed he had none as Man. I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume you have no more than he had. Whence then this quick and righteous Diſcriminator appearing in your Conſciences? You will not ſay, it is of Satan; it muſt therefore either be of Man, or of God. For the Reaſons above hinted, it cannot be of Man; it muſt therefore be of God. Wonderful is the Mercy, and great the Advantage to every Man, that God himſelf, according to the Scriptures, thus condeſcends to be <hi>the Teacher of his People,</hi>

3. Every productive Power brings forth its own Likeneſs; the evil Spirit an evil Birth, and the good Spirit a Birth anſwerable to its Goodneſs; and as every natural Birth admits of a Growth, ſo doth this ſpiritual Birth in the Soul.<note place="margin">Luke xiii. 18, 22.</note> Our Saviour repreſents its gradual Progreſſion,<note place="margin">John iv. 14.</note> in thoſe Similies of the Increaſe the Muſtard-ſeed, the Proceſs of Leaven, and the ſpringing up of <hi>living Water</hi> into everlaſting Life.

                  <note place="margin">Rom. viii. 2.</note> yet he was ſenſible of higher Degrees of Attainment ſtill before him, and therefore, after he had been near thirty Years in the Apoſtleſhip, he makes this Acknowledgment; <q>Not as though I had already attained,<note place="margin">Phil. iii. 12, 13, 14.</note> either were already perfect, but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which alſo I am apprehended of Chriſt Jeſus. Brethren, I count not myſelf to have apprehended; but this one Thing I do, forgetting thoſe Things which are behind, and reaching forth unto thoſe Things which are before, I preſs toward the Mark, for the Prize of the high Calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Thoſe who treat this Doctrine, of the Neceſſity of Man's being renewed, led, and guided by the Spirit of his Maker, as a Diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:021391_0043_0FB3696F283912C8"/>to human Reaſon, put the higheſt Indignity upon the ſupreme Wiſdom, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Power. The Dignity of human Nature conſiſts not in Self-ſufficiency. The moſt exalted of created Beings neither exiſt, nor act independent of their Creator; much leſs Man,<note place="margin">Heb. ii. 7.</note> who in his primitive Purity was <hi>made lower than the Angels.</hi> He ſtands in continual Need of Divine Help; and his true Dignity conſiſts in being, by his Reaſon, above all inferior Creatures capable of <hi>conſciouſly receiving</hi> that Aſſiſtance, and of being thereby preferred to, and preſerved in a bleſſed Union and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with his Maker. It cannot be any leſſening to an Inferior to be directed and guided by a ſuperior Being; eſpecially by the Supreme Lord, and ſole Author of all Exiſtence, Infinite in Excellency, Power and Wiſdom, and Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in Glory. Endued with his Spirit, in any Degree, the Creature is raiſed above the higheſt Elevation of its own Nature; and the more it is clothed with it, the more it is dignified and exalted.</p>
               <p>No created Being, by its natural Powers, can riſe above its natural Sphere. To reach a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limer Station, it muſt be aſſiſted by Strength ſuperior to its own; a Power equal to the Height of its Aſcent. It is only when the Sun of Righteouſneſs ſheds forth its quickening Beams upon the Spirit of Man, that the poor Worm is capacitated in Reality, to take Wing and mount above its ſublunary Limits, towards the Regions celeſtial.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Some Writers of the Epicurian Caſt, have imagined it beneath the Divine Greatneſs, for the Sovereign Lord of all, to ſtoop ſo low as
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:021391_0044_0FB36970C77DB1B0"/>to make Man a peculiar Object of his Notice and Regard. To ſuch as miſtake thoſe ſure Marks of Degeneracy, <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Haughtineſs,</hi> for Greatneſs of Soul, this may ſeem reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; but in him to whom <hi>Pride is Abomination,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro. xvi. 5.</note> and as diſtant from his Similitude as Darkneſs is to Light, it cannot have any Place. What it is not below him to create, it cannot be beneath him to regard, proportionably to the End he made it for; and ſeeing Man was created <hi>for a Purpoſe of his Glory,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. xliii. 7.</note> and to partake of his Felicity, it would derogate from his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodneſs, to ſuppoſe he ſhould look upon it as below him to enable Man to anſwer the great Ends of his Creation; which he could not by any Means do, without a competent Aſſiſtance from his Maker. Pride was the Cauſe of the Degeneracy of Angels, and its natural Conſequence is the Deſtruction of Peace and Felicity to all that entertain it. By being ſomething in our own Conceit, attributing any Good to ourſelves, or aſpiring above our Place and due Order, we center in Pride and Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance. Created Beings may be guilty of this; but it is impoſſible to that all-perfect Exiſtence, who is Infinite, Omnipotent, and Immutable.</p>
               <p>This viſible World demonſtrates, it was made by an Omnipotent Power, and is preſerved by the ſame Power. Without Power it could not be made, and as <hi>Tho. Sherlock</hi> juſtly obſerves, <q>That which owes its very Being to Power,<note place="margin">Diſcourſe on Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> muſt depend upon the Power that made it, for it can have no Principle of Self-ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence independent on its Cauſe.</q> What doth not neceſſarily exiſt, muſt both be origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally created, and continually upheld by the
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:021391_0045_0FB369721F6A7718"/>Power, that made it. It had no Being before its Creation. It cannot retain its Being againſt the Will of its Creator. Its Exiſtence and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ſtand equally in the Power of its Maker, without whom it was nothing, could never have exiſted, nor can continue in Exiſtence. It was made by his Power, is preſerved by his Power, and upon the Withdrawment of his Power would diſſolve and evaniſh into its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Nothing. There is no Medium between Self-exiſtence and Dependence on its Cauſe; therefore a Ceſſation from it of the Power that made it, is Annihilation to it. Thus, as all created Things were made, and ſtill ſubſiſt ſoley by the Energy of the Creator's Will and Power, he muſt neceſſarily, whilſt they exiſt, be omni-preſent with them, in them, and thro' them; therefore cannot be ignorant of any Thing relating to them, nor unconcerned about them, or any Part of them.</p>
               <p>The continual Interpoſition and Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendence of the Spirit of God, was always requiſite to Man, both to preſerve him whilſt in Innocence, and to recover him from under his fallen Eſtate, by governing the Effects of natural Cauſes; and to counteract the Wiles, and oppoſe the Influences of the evil Spirit. Therefore the great Mediator for, and Redeemer of Men, was from the Beginning, not only incarnately and corporeally given for a Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation for the Sins of the whole World, to be teſtified, or verified, in due Time; but he was alſo as univerſally given, in a ſpiritual Manner, to be <hi>a Witneſs, a Leader,</hi> and <hi>Commander.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. lv. 4.</note> 1. He is ſpiritually given for <hi>a Witneſs,</hi> to teſtify againſt Sin in every Breaſt, by his Smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings

For <hi>a Leader</hi> and <hi>Commander,</hi> to ſuch as pay due Regard to his Convictions, by turning from Iniquity to him that ſmites them, and cleaving to him in that Faith and Love he produces in them.

               <p>Chap. vii. 5. he ſaith, <q>When we were in the Fleſh,</q> (under the Dominion of the carnal Nature) <q>the Motions of Sins which were</q> (manifeſted) <q>by the Law, did work in our Members to bring forth Fruit unto Death.</q> Here he refers back to that State
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:021391_0049_0FB3697D4925FAE0"/>of Sin and Death, they had formerly been enthralled in, but were now paſt, as fully appears by the ſucceeding Verſe, which ſaith, <q>But now we are delivered from the Law, <hi>that being dead wherein we were held,</hi> that we ſhould ſerve in Newneſs of Spirit, and not in the Oldneſs of the Letter.</q> Verſe 7, he returns to the former State again, and becomes more particular. "I had not known Sin," ſaith he, "but by the Law." Before he became ſenſibly convicted in his own Conſcience, where the Senſe of the Law was opened to him; he remained in his firſt State of natural Blindneſs, yet knew it not to be ſuch, notwithſtanding his <hi>learned Education,</hi> and <hi>legal Strictneſs.</hi> Though dead as to any Senſe of Divine Life, yet he was alive in the Spirit of the World;<note place="margin">Rom. vii. 9</note> "For" ſaith he, <q>I was alive without the Law once; but when the Commandment came, Sin revived, and I died.</q> Oppoſed by the internal Adminiſtration of the ſpiritual Law, which brought Conviction, the ſinful Nature was afreſh excited by the Powers of Evil, and ſprung up as with new Life and Vigour, to obſtruct his Eſcape from it; <q>For,<note place="margin">Verſ. 8.</note> without the Law Sin was dead.</q> That is, its Nature remained quiet and undiſturbed, enjoying its Indulgence without Interruption, till the Law of Life was adminiſtered againſt it.

                     </gap>. For Sin taking Occaſion by the Commandment, deceived me, and by it ſlew me.</q> Or, darkened me, and brought a Senſe of Death over me. It ſeems to have deceived him at firſt into a Belief
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:021391_0050_0FB3697E240CFD18"/>that the Law brought forth Death, becauſe he found a Senſe of Death enſue upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of this Law; but Death is the Fruit of Sin, which is condemned by the Law: For ſaith he,<note place="margin">Verſ. 12, 15</note> 
                  <q>the Law is Holy, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment Holy, Juſt, and Good. Was then that which is Good made Death unto me? God forbid.</q> He found it was that which ſo violently oppoſed it that produced Death, and occaſioned the Condemnation of the Law to come upon him, which diſcovered this Death in him. This was permitted <hi>that Sin might appear Sin,</hi> and that <hi>by the</hi> convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Force of the Commandment <hi>it might become exceeding ſinful</hi> in his View, or be held by him in Abhorrence.

                  <q>
                     <hi>The Law is ſpiritual,</hi> but I am carnal, ſold under Sin.</q> That is, he found himſelf as really in Captivity under Sin, as thoſe are to their Purchaſers who are ſold into Slavery.<note place="margin">Verſ. 15.</note> 
                  <q>For that which I do, I allow not.</q> I am convinced it is Evil, and would gladly be delivered from it, but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding my Convictions, am under its Power, and unable to extricate myſelf.<note place="margin">Verſ. 19.</note> 
                  <q>For the Good that I would, I do not; but the Evil which I would not, that I do.</q> Yet, in patient Submiſſion, and fervent cleaving to God, ſome Conſolation attends this awakened Condition;<note place="margin">Verſ. 20, 21, 22, 23.</note> for, <q>If I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but Sin that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in me.

               </p>
               <p>He then,<note place="margin">Verſ. 25.</note> ſtill perſonating One in this ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling Situation, thanks God, through Jeſus Chriſt, for having brought him thus far on his Chriſtian Courſe and Warfare, that he could <hi>will</hi> to do Good, though yet <hi>unable</hi> actually to perform it. Hence he had a Ground of Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, in Hope that he who had wrought <hi>the Will</hi> in him, would alſo in due Time perfect <hi>the Deed</hi> by him. In Concluſion, he proceeds to ſhew, though this had <hi>once</hi> been his Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he <hi>now</hi> experienced perfect Deliverance, from all the perplexing and afflicting Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cances of this, and the ſeveral exerciſing States he had formerly paſſed through, and had juſt been giving ſo lively a Deſcription of.<note place="margin">Rom. viii. 1, 2.</note> 
                  <q>There is therefore," ſaith he, "now no Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to them which are in Chriſt Jeſus," (as he then certainly was) "who walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit: For the Law of <hi>the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus, hath ſet me free from the Law of Sin and Death.</hi>
                  </q> This again teſtifies his Deliverance, and anſwers to that firſt cited,<note place="margin">Chap. vii. 6.</note> 
                  <q>Now we are delivered from the Law,</q> (which condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for Sin) "that," (ſinful Nature) <q>being dead wherein we were held, that we ſhould ſerve in Newneſs of Spirit, and not in the Oldneſs of the Letter.</q> With theſe accords that of <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1. 12, 13. <q>Giving Thanks

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>In the Paſſages above cited from <hi>Rom.</hi> vii. and viii. the experienced Apoſtle evidently includes a Repreſentation of three very different Conditions, in their Courſe of Progreſſion, and State of Diſparity from each other. Firſt, a natural blind unconvicted State; which is that of Darkneſs and Death, anſwering to the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Chaos before Light was brought forth. Second, a State of Illumination and Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, of Conviction and internal Warfare, in order to a complete Converſion; which partakes of a Mixture, and ſhews Light and Darkneſs in the Act of Separation, like that in <hi>Gen.</hi> i. 3, 4, 5. Third, a State of Redemption from the Power of Sin, through Purification, and a Tranſlation into the ſpiritual Kingdom of Chriſt; which is the State of the perfect Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, and completes the new Creation, wherein every Thing takes its due Place, and moves in its proper Order. I now refer it to the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Reader, whether it is not an Abſurdity to imagine, that theſe three diverſe, and in ſome Reſpects contrary States ſhould all ſubſiſt together, at the ſame Time, in the ſame Subject.</p>
               <p>By this Repreſentation, which contains a brief and comprehenſive Delineation of the Work of the New-birth, the Apoſtle ſhews to ſuch as are young in the Faith, what different States they have to paſs through in that prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory Travel, and alſo reminds the Regenerate
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:021391_0053_0FB3698670408A00"/>of what they have witneſſed, in the Lines of his own Experience. He deſcribes the various Steps, and principal Leadings of the Holy Spirit, till by its effectual Operation, the Soul is rendered a new Creature, and introduced into the Kingdom of God; which being inward and ſpiritual, is entered by an inward and ſpiritual Way. Hence it is clear, a Man may acquire all the Learning, and receive all the Degrees that Schools and Colleges can beſtow, with all the Authority Men can afford him, and may be ſtrict in the Practice of all the Forms and Exteriors of Religion; and yet remain <hi>the natural Man</hi> ſtill. Theſe can bring him no nearer to true Regeneration, than he was the Moment of his Birth; for the New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth is the Work of the Holy Spirit only. Nothing but the Spirit of Holineſs can make a Man Holy; for nothing can communicate what it hath not. Nothing can ſet Men free from the Power of Sin, and its Wages, Death, but the Law, or Power, of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus individually adminiſtered. This, which turneth Sinners into Saints, by a real Purgation, and renders them, as to their inward State, new Creatures, remains to be their Light and Leader, and the primary Guide of their Life and Conduct, by its immediate Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations in the Heart; whereby it frequently brings Scripture-Truths to their Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and opens the Senſe of them profitably to their Underſtandings, at the ſame Time influencing the Mind to a Practice anſwerable.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Evident as it is, that the Apoſtle in the foregoing Scriptures, deſcribes divers Changes of Condition, which through the Operation
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:021391_0054_0FB36987DED353B0"/>and Effect of the Holy Spirit, he had <hi>certainly known</hi> and <hi>ſenſibly felt;</hi> yet ſome have appeared even amongſt the Leaders of the People, who acknowledge,<note n="*" place="bottom">See a Quotation from Sermons publiſhed under the ludicrous Title of <hi>Yorick</hi>'s, in the Gentleman's Magazine for <hi>April,</hi> 1766.</note> 
                  <q>The Influence of God's Spirit enables us to render him an acceptable Service,</q> but aſſert, <hi>that it is in a Way imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible to us; that the Sacred Writings are utterly ſilent concerning any ſenſible Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of its Workings within us, that they cannot be diſtinguiſhed from the Efforts of our own Reaſon; that all Pretences to it are ſuggeſted by an enthuſiaſtic or diſtempered Fancy; and that there never was a Chriſtian with a cool Head, and a ſound Judgment, that in any Inſtance of a Change of Life, would preſume to ſay, which Part of his Reformation was owing to Divine Help.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The truly ſound reformed Chriſtian knows and acknowledges, every Part of his Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is owing to Divine Help; and whoever propagate the above-cited anti-ſcriptural Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, demonſtrate their Ignorance of true Regeneration, and that their Wiſdom is but the ſuperficial Wiſdom of Words, which can only enable them to make a Shew of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, by talking about the Things of God, without any right Underſtanding of them. The Pomp of Science, and the Flouriſh of Eloquence, have no more Alliance to Truth than the Pride of Life. They belong to the Wiſdom of this World, by which God is not to be known;<note place="margin">1 Cor. i. 21.</note> 
                  <q>For the World by Wiſdom knew not God,<note place="margin">Ibid. ii. 11.</note> nor the Things of God.</q> All the Knowledge of <hi>the natural Man, the
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:021391_0055_0FB3698BF4D26278"/>Man whoſe Nature remains unchanged,</hi> whether called <hi>Pagan, Jew,</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and whether it be ſtiled Philoſophy or Divinity, is but the ineffectual ideal Wiſdom of this World: The vaunting Head-knowledge. It is not the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from above, by which alone God, and the Things of God are to be <hi>known,</hi> that is, <hi>experienced.</hi> Theſe are out of the Reach of Arts, Languages, and Sciences, and are diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered only by the Manifeſtation of the Spirit of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Heart.<note place="margin">Col. ii. 3.</note> 
                  <q>In <hi>whom</hi> are hid all the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge.</q> Yet though the World by all its admired and celebrated Wiſdom, knows not God, there is a Wiſdom communicated by which he is known. "For God," ſaith Holy Writ,<note place="margin">2 Cor. iv. 6, 7.</note> 
                  <q>who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Light to ſhine out of Darkneſs, <hi>hath ſhined in our Hearts,</hi> to give <hi>the Light of the Knowledge</hi> of the Glory of God in the Face</q> (or inward Appearance) <q>of Jeſus Chriſt.</q> The Apoſtle adds, <q>We have this Treaſure in earthen Veſſels,</q> (we enjoy it now whilſt in theſe Bodies of Clay) <q>that the Excellency of <hi>the Power</hi> may be of God, and not of us.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This luminous and excellent Power operates upon the humble thankful Acceptor, ſo as to open an Underſtanding of what he reads, both in Scripture and other experimental Writings, often giving him to feel <hi>that</hi> concerning which he reads, and rendering it of improving Effect to him. But he who rejects the Means, can never attain the End. He who refuſes or flies from the Light of Life, when it offers itſelf to him by Reproof and Conviction, not believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be of God, nor receiving it as ſuch,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:021391_0056_0FB36991239033C8"/>ſtops its Operation, prevents it from opening itſelf to him, and enlarging in him. For <hi>the unbelieving Heart ſhuts up its own Way,</hi>

               <p n="4">4. What Man upon Earth can ſay, he has not had Convictions? Or, that he has had them without any Senſe of them? Who could have a Senſe of them, and not diſtinguiſh it from the Efforts of his own Reaſon; not diſtinguiſh the Reprover from the Reproved? Unfelt Convictions are Impoſſibilities. In what Manner is the Work of Renovation known, without any Preception of it in its Progreſs? Did the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſo patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally deſcribe the painful States he had travelled through, and the oppoſite Powers engaged within him, without ever having a certain Senſe of them? Or is the Coolneſs of his Head, and the Soundneſs of his Judgment now to be arraigned, and are his Chriſtian Experiences to be treated, only as the Iſſues of an inthuſiaſtic or diſtempered Fancy?</p>
               <p>How could any witneſs <hi>Repentance unto Life, Remiſſion of Sins,</hi> and the <hi>Times of Refreſhing</hi> from the Preſence of the Lord, without an inward Senſe of them? Where all the Cries, the Pantings and Thirſtings after the Divine Preſence, uttered by the ſacred Writers <hi>without a Senſe</hi> of that Want; and were all their triumphant Rejoicings in the Conſolation of his Preſence, expreſſed under <hi>a total Inſenſibility</hi> of it?

<pb n="53" facs="unknown:021391_0057_0FB36993EB403078"/>Where can ſuch blind Leaders bring their blind Followers to? Thoſe who turn their Backs on the Light, muſt walk in Darkneſs. It is the ſole Property of the Spirit of Chriſt, the Light of Men, to make true Diſcoveries to the Mind, both reſpecting itſelf, and every Thing elſe that concerns it. Hence he is rightly ſtiled <hi>the Sun of Righteouſneſs;</hi> the ſame Thing to the Soul of Man, that the Sun in the Firmament is to his Body.

                  <q>The natural Man," ſaith the Apoſtle, "receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the Things of the Spirit of God, for they are Fooliſhneſs unto him, neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually diſcerned.</q>
               </p>
               <p>What! ſaith the mighty Man of Reaſon, muſt I put out my Eyes in order to ſee? Muſt I lay aſide and renounce my Reaſon, to obtain a better Underſtanding? It is impoſſible, abſurd and prepoſterous. Very true; and it is equally true, that no ſuch Abſurdity is required. It is neither right Reaſon, nor the proper Uſe of Man's Reaſon, that is objected to and adviſed againſt. For right Reaſon is Truth, and is ever correſpondent with the inward Motions of the Spirit of Truth; and Man's rational Faculty is what renders him capable of receiving divine Influence and Inſtruction, without which it is
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:021391_0058_0FB369956A7C4050"/>impoſſible to conceive he could be a fit Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for it; and was his Reaſon in ſuch a perfect State, as to merit the Name of <hi>right Reaſon,</hi> he would not ſtand in ſuch abſolute Need of it. But it evidently appears, from the various Biaſſes and Prepoſſeſſions Men are generally under, the Weakneſs and Mutability of their Underſtandings, and the innumerable and irreconcilable Differences amongſt them, eſpecially the learned and leading Part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that human Reaſon is far from being always agreeable to right Reaſon, which is unchangeably true. What is cautioned againſt therefore, is the ſetting up human Reaſon above its due Place in Religion, making it the Leader inſtead of the Follower of Revelation, the Teacher, inſtead of the Learner; and eſteeming it veſted with a Kind of <hi>Self-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency,</hi> independent of the Direction and Help of God's Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>We are not required to <hi>lay aſide</hi> our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, either in order to, or under the Influences of the Spirit; but, as prudent and docile Scholars, to ſubmit them to the neceſſary Inſtruction and Improvement of that infallible Maſter of Infinite Wiſdom and Knowledge, who is the<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſa. liv. 13.

The Holy Men of God were not deprived of their Underſtandings,<note place="margin">1 Pet. i. 21.</note>

                  <q>This <hi>is Life eternal,</hi> that they might <hi>know thee</hi> the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</q> Truly to know him, is to participate of the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening Senſe of his Life, through the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated Influence of his eternal Spirit. Thus to know him, is to partake of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> or <hi>true Goſpel Diſpenſation;</hi> for <hi>therein</hi> it is declared,<note place="margin">Jer xxxi. 34.</note> 
                  <q>They ſhall <hi>all know me</hi> from the leaſt of them to the greateſt of them.</q> Accordingly the living Chriſtian has a <hi>certain Senſe</hi> of Divine Life in his own Breaſt, which
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:021391_0062_0FB3699DA0861C60"/>affords him Inſtruction, Strength and Comfort, in ſuch a Manner, as he waits in Faithfulneſs upon it, that he is under no abſolute Neceſſity to lean upon the Teachings of other Men; yet when they come in a Degree of the ſame Life, he accepts them as inſtrumentally from God.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Life of God</hi> in Chriſt, is the very Soul of Chriſtianity; without which the beſt Forms and higheſt Profeſſions are but as Members of a dead Body, unavailable and unacceptable. <q>He that hath the Son <hi>hath Life,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 John v. 12.</note> and he that hath not the Son of God <hi>hath not Life."</hi> Becauſe I live,"<note place="margin">John xiv. 19, 20.</note> ſaith he, "ye ſhall live alſo. <hi>At that Day, ye ſhall know,</hi> that I am in my Father, and <hi>you in me,</hi> and <hi>I in you.</hi>
                  </q> It is becauſe he lives in, and communicates of his Life to his ſpiritual Followers, that they live alſo. Of theſe the true Church, the adopted Body of Chriſt, under all Denominations, is compoſed. Theſe alone are his peculiar <hi>Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,</hi> or <hi>Clergy.</hi> This Eccleſiaſtical Body of Chriſt, is a living Body, rendered ſuch by the Inſpiration of his Life.<note place="margin">Col. iii. 4.</note> He is the Life com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all his true Members. By his vital Influence he communicates a living Senſe of Truth to them, inclines them to himſelf, and inſpires them both with the Deſire and Power of Obedience, and as they advance in Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, he favours them with increaſing Taſtes of Divine Grace and Love, the Savour of the Holy Unction, and the indwelling Virtue and Glory of his Heavenly Preſence.<note place="margin">Eph. iv. 4.</note> 
                  <q>There is one Body, and one Spirit.</q> Was there not one and the ſame Spirit throughout the whole Church, it could not be one Body, nor a living Body.<note place="margin">In Joh. Tract. 26.</note> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>Non poteſt vivere corpus Chriſti niſi
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:021391_0063_0FB3699FDEEF1910"/>de ſpiritu Chriſti,</hi>
                  </q> ſaith <hi>Auguſtine: The Body of Chriſt cannot live but by the Spirit of Chriſt.</hi> He who partakes not of the ſame Spirit with the Head, is no true Member of the Body. His ſpiritual Influence is the precious Blood, or Spring of Life which renders all his Members living, and what gives Life gives a Senſe of that Life;<note place="margin">Col. iii. 3.</note> but though their Life is <hi>moſt ſurely known to themſelves,</hi> it <hi>is hid with Chriſt in God,</hi> from the Knowledge of thoſe who remain unquickened by it; and hence ariſeth all their Oppoſition to it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We are all by Nature Strangers to this Divine Life, and we cannot, by any Means, obtain it for ourſelves. It is not of Man's Acquirement, but God's Communication; and as far out of the Reach of the moſt Learned, as of the moſt Illiterate. It is hid from the Wiſe and Prudent (in their own Eyes) and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to thoſe who are as Babes (to the World's Wiſdom.) It is not the high Learned, but the Humble that God teaches, and the Meek that he guides in the Paths of Truth and Judgment. Every one's Eye therefore ought to be humbly to God alone, and not to be fixed upon the Wiſe, the Scribe, the Diſputer of this World; for <hi>God hath,</hi> by the powerful Simplicity and Purity of his Goſpel Diſpenſation,<note place="margin">1 Cor. i. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>made fooliſh the Wiſdom of this World.</hi> Yet ſo fond is the World of <hi>its own Wiſdom,</hi> that it has in great Meaſure detruded the Croſs of Chriſt, and true ſpiritual Religion, and erected and ſupported <hi>this Idol</hi> in its Room. After this Image the World has wondered, and indeed it hath been a Means wonderfully to blind, enſnare and deceive its Worſhippers, whoſe Faith ſtands <hi>in
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:021391_0064_0FB369A49D2DAE48"/>the Wiſdom of Men,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. ii. 5.</note> and <hi>not in the Power of God;</hi> and is therefore the Reverſe of the Faith of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="4">4. From a due Conſideration of the debaſed and corrupt State of Mankind, ſince the Fall, and of the great and good End of their Creation, it muſt evidently appear, that Regeneration hath ever been the <hi>one Thing needful;</hi> a Work eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial for all to experience. And as the Birth of the Spirit cannot be brought forth by any Thing but the Spirit, ſo it muſt alſo be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in its Growth and Accompliſhment by the Spirit. Hence the abiding, or indwelling of the Spirit, remains to be of abſolute Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to the Regenerate, that as their Souls are quickened into the Divine Life by it, they may continue to live, move, and have their Being as Chriſtians therein, and be ſuſtained in a ſpiritual Union, and bleſſed Communion with their Maker.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Eſſentiality of true Religion hath ever been the ſame, primarily conſiſting in the Life of God being raiſed up, and the Love of God ſhed abroad in the Heart, operating therein to its Renovation, and to every virtuous and benevolent End. Whatever of Externals or Ceremonials have, at ſundry Times, been ſuper-added by Divine Direction or Command, were not intended to alter, or unſettle Men from due and conſtant Attention to <hi>vital ſpiritual Religion;</hi> but when they were become greatly degenerated from it, and darkened concerning it, the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Creator was pleaſed, by Means ſuited to their eſtranged and carnal Condition, to point it out to them, and lead them by Signs and Symbols towards it. Thus the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Law
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:021391_0065_0FB369A750A1B0C0"/>was not meant to be the Whole of Religion to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. iii. 24.</note> or to ſupercede the internal Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of Grace; but only to be as <hi>a Schoolmaſter to bring them to Chriſt</hi> in Spirit, in whom all is included and fulfilled, and whoſe Preſence was then with the Faithful amongſt them, who had ſpiritual Communion with him; for, according to Scripture,<note place="margin">1 Cor. x. 3, 4.</note> 
                  <q>They did all eat the ſame ſpiritual Meat, and did all drink the ſame ſpiritual Drink; for they drank of that ſpiritual Rock that followed them; and <hi>that Rock was Chriſt.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It is a vain Thing to imagine, that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ever wholly conſiſted in Mode or Form; or that the All-perfect Lord at any Time diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed with the Subſtance for the Sake of the Shadow; or ever made any Alteration therein, by Diverſity of Inſtitutions, from arbitrary Will and Pleaſure, merely to exerciſe his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, as though Power was a darling Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, and more regarded by him than Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, and Goodneſs; or as though his Attributes could be divided in him. No; he is God, and changeth not. His Law is <hi>his own Spirit of eternal Rectitude,</hi> and his Retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution according to every Man's State and Works. The different Modifications that have appeared amongſt Men in Point of Religion, have been occaſioned by the different Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Conditions of Mankind. The All-wiſe God hath directed ſome for a Time, in Condeſcenſion, for the good End above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned; and divers Combinations of Men have invented and enjoined Abundance more, according to their own carnal Miſapprehenſions
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:021391_0066_0FB369A845162F60"/>of ſpiritual Things, or to advance their own ſiniſter Purpoſes.</p>
               <p>Exterior Forms are but temporary Matters. They are no Eſſentials of true Chriſtianity. The great Author of it repreſents it <hi>as a Well of Water in Man ſpringing up into everlaſting Life.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John iv. 14.</note> It radically ariſeth from a living, abiding, increaſing Principle in Man, of a pure, ſpiritual and heavenly Nature. As this is cordially embraced, it enlarges in the Soul, expels the Works and Power of Darkneſs, and produceth its own genuine Fruits of Humility, Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial, Patience, Reſignation to God, and Truſt in him alone; Righteouſneſs, Holineſs, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Gentleneſs, Temperance, Goodneſs, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly-kindneſs, Charity. It derives its Origin from Heaven, and leads to Heaven. It carries the Soul out of all Formalities and falſe Reſts, up to the Supreme Good himſelf. It breaks down all our own Self-will, and brings into perfect Reſignation to the Divine Will. In this humble contrited Frame, and no other, can we ſincerely and truly ſay, <hi>Thy Kingdom come! Thy Will be done!</hi> For whilſt our Wills ſtand in Separation from the Will of God, we cannot addreſs him in theſe Terms with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety; or <hi>in Spirit and Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. The Pride of Man is naturally averſe to this abaſed and broken Situation. It knows not how to ſubmit to be, or to think itſelf, <hi>nothing;</hi> though it is worſe than nothing. It would fain erect and plume itſelf upon ſome Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſome Eſtimation, or Deſerving of its own; yet all its Pretences to <hi>Merit</hi> are falſe and vain. Man being nothing as ſuch, but what God has made him, and poſſeſſing nothing but
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:021391_0067_0FB369AA84F06398"/>what he affords him, is wholly God's, and not his own, and is therefore in Duty bound to walk in Obedience to him, every Moment of his Life, which is given him for that End. And ſeeing Man has fallen ſhort of his Duty, and hath ſinned againſt his Sovereign by Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, it is neither in his Power, by any Thing he can perform, to merit Heaven, nor to purchaſe Remiſſion for himſelf. He can neither undo what he has miſdone, nor render to his Maker an Equivalent for the Treſpaſſes he hath committed againſt him. But ſuch is the merciful Goodneſs, and <hi>Free Grace</hi> of God towards his helpleſs Creatures, that he offers both Forgiveneſs and Felicity upon the moſt reaſonable Terms of Repentance and Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. To the Willing and Obedient, to him who is faithful unto Death, to him that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh, through Divine Aſſiſtance, are the Promiſes of eternal Life. Upon the Foundation of theſe free and voluntary Offers of the Divine Goodneſs, and Man's Compliance with the Conditions, ſtands his Title.<note place="margin">Rev. xxii. 14.</note> 
                  <q>Bleſſed are they that <hi>do his Commandments,</hi> that they <hi>may have Right</hi> to the Tree of Life, and may enter in through the Gates into the City.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. The Laws and Requiſitions of God to Man, are in Scripture often ſtiled <hi>Covenants.</hi> Not meaning that Man has perſonally bound himſelf, on his Part to perform the Conditions, but that he is really in Duty as deeply obliged, and as firmly bound to do the Will of his Creator, as if he had voluntarily bound himſelf in the ſtrongeſt Obligations poſſible. The Reaſon is, Man owes his very Being, and all the Good he receives, ſpiritual and temporal,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:021391_0068_0FB369ABDFE8FDB8"/>to his Maker, to whom he ſtands indebted for all, and who therefore hath an unqueſtionable Right to claim all Affection, Gratitude, and Obedience from him; and more eſpecially as it is all for his own everlaſting Advantage. There is alſo an internal <hi>ſpiritual Covenant,</hi> a <hi>Divine Connection,</hi> which the Heart of Man feels, in his Faithfulneſs, to his Creator: The Spirit of Life, in Chriſt Jeſus, which ſets free from the Bonds of Sin and Death, and <hi>unites the Soul to its Saviour</hi> in the powerful Covenant of Divine Love. By this, through Faith, it becomes engrafted into Chriſt; and by Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, it remains in him as a Branch in the Vine; or is incorporated with him as its Head; for <q>he that is joined unto the Lord is one Spirit.</q>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. RELIGION here, and Salvation hereafter, are as much the Concern and Duty of the Illiterate and Ignorant, as of the Wiſe and Learned. And as thoſe are by much the greater Number, religious Duty muſt undoubtedly conſiſt in ſomething equally attainable and practicable by all; for God is no Reſpecter of Perſons. It cannot lie eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially in literal Knowledge, nor in any peculiar Mode of Education; for theſe are the Lot of few, in Compariſon of the whole of Mankind. Happineſs being the End of Man's Creation, and the univerſal indiſpenſable Concern of every Man, the effective Means of Regeneration and Salvation muſt be attainable by every Man.
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:021391_0070_0FB369B440938D70"/>Nothing but the Omnipreſent, and All-effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Spirit of God can be this Means; for nothing elſe is univerſal, nor any Way adequate to the Work. The Spirit of God therefore, being neceſſary to every Man, is afforded to every Man, by him who with-holds nothing neceſſary.</p>
               <p>This Holy operative Spirit, <hi>Solomon,</hi> under its Influence, with great Propriety, ſtiles <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and repreſents it, in familiar Language, as calling upon Mankind, <hi>to turn at its Reproofs,</hi> with a Promiſe,<note place="margin">Prov. i.</note> to <hi>pour out its Spirit unto them.</hi> He alſo impleads thoſe as <hi>Fools</hi> who reject or ſlight its Reproofs, or Convictions in their Conſciences;<note place="margin">Verſe 20, 21.</note> by which he ſhews, <hi>it accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies them even in the Streets and Places of Concourſe.</hi> Recounting the great Works of this Spirit of Wiſdom, he elſewhere teſtifies, <q>She preſerved the firſt formed Father of the World,<note place="margin">Wiſd. x. 1.</note> that was created alone, and brought him out of his Fall.</q> She was not only his <hi>Preſerver</hi> before his Fall, but his Requickener and Reſtorer out of that Death, he through Tranſgreſſion fell into; and ſeeing the whole rational Progeny of <hi>Adam</hi> are naturally under the like Neceſſity of being born of the Spirit, its Adminiſtration is offered to all, in due Degrees, and every Individual in all Ages, who have experienced the New-birth, by which right Reformation is wrought, have known it to be effected by the Operation of the Spirit. This the wiſe Author above-cited witneſſeth, in his Acknowledgment to Almighty Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when he ſaith,<note place="margin">Wiſd. ix. 17, 18.</note> 
                  <q>Thy Council who hath known, except thou give <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>ſend thy Holy Spirit from above?</hi> For <hi>ſo</hi> the
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:021391_0071_0FB369B5A34CD998"/>Ways of them who lived on the Earth <hi>were reformed,</hi> and Men <hi>were taught</hi> the Things that are pleaſing unto thee, <hi>and were ſaved through Wiſdom.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">Evident Tokens of internal Religion, and the <hi>immediate Manifeſtations</hi> of the Spirit for that End, appear throughout both the Old Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament and the New. Before the Flood, the old World was favoured with the Manifeſtation of the Holy Spirit, as it is implied <hi>Gen.</hi> vi. 3. My Spirit ſhall not always ſtrive with," or rather <hi>in,</hi> "Man." For ſo <hi>Hebreans</hi> ſay it ought to be rendered. And indeed, where could the Spirit ſo properly ſtrive as in the Soul of Man, where the Seat of Corruption is, and to which the Suggeſtions of Evil are applied? And to what End ſhould it ſtrive with them, but to bring them to Repentance and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and to become, through their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, the Kingdom, or ruling Power of God in them.</p>
               <p>Renovation of Heart by the Holy Spirit, and its genuine Fruits of Repentance towards God, Faith in him, and Obedience to him, was the principal and eſſential Part of Religion alſo among the <hi>Iſraelites. Deut.</hi> xxx. 10. <hi>Moſes</hi> repreſents the Conditions on the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of which they ſhould be entitled to the Promiſes. <q>If thou ſhalt hearken unto the Voice of the Lord thy God, to keep his Commandments and his Statutes, which are written in this Book of the Law, and if thou turn unto the Lord thy God, with all thine Heart, and with all thy Soul.</q> Theſe are the Terms; firſt, that they ſhould keep the Law; this was the external and legal Part
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:021391_0072_0FB369B720BB2E50"/>of their Duty. Second, that <hi>they ſhould turn their whole Hearts and Souls to God;</hi> this was the internal and evangelical Part. He leaves them not here in a State of Uncertainty, but proceeds to ſhew them to what their inward Attention ſhould be turned.<note place="margin">Verſe 11, &amp;c.</note> "For," ſaith he, <q>this Commandment which I command thee this Day,</q> (or this which I command thee to turn thine Heart unto) <q>is <hi>not hidden from thee,</hi> neither is it far off. It is not in Heaven that thou ſhouldſt ſay, who ſhall go up for us to Heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it and do it? Neither is it beyond the Sea, that thou ſhouldſt ſay, who ſhall go over the Sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it and do it? But the <hi>Word is very nigh unto thee,</hi> in thy Mouth, and in thy Heart, that thou mayſt do it.</q> The Apoſtle aſſumes and explains this Paſſage, <hi>Rom.</hi> x. 6, 7, 8. <q>The Righteouſneſs <hi>which is of Faith,</hi> ſpeaketh on this wiſe, Say not in thine Heart, who ſhall aſcend into Heaven?</q> (that is to bring <hi>Chriſt</hi> down from above.) <q>Or, who ſhall deſcend into the Deep?</q> (that is to bring up <hi>Chriſt</hi> again from the Dead) <q>But what ſaith it? The <hi>Word</hi> is nigh thee, even in thy Mouth, and in thy Heart. <hi>That is the Word of Faith which we preach.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>By this Explanation of the Apoſtle, it appears, 1ſt, That beſides the Law, <hi>Moſes then</hi> preached to <hi>Iſrael the ſame Words of Faith,</hi> which himſelf, and his evangelical Brethren did. 2d, That <hi>this Word is Chriſt</hi> in Spirit, calling for Attention and Obedience in the Heart, or Conſcience, of Man, in order to effect his Reſtoration and Salvation. 3d, This
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:021391_0073_0FB369BD84C9DC50"/>is not a local, or temporary, but anward Viſitation of the Saviour of Mankind, by his Spirit in the Heart.</p>
               <p>The Word of Faith is the Word of Truth, the Word of the everlaſting Goſpel; and not a Compoſition of Letters. The Term <hi>Word,</hi> like many other Words, is uſed in various Senſes; as a Speech or Saying, an Engagement, a Report, a Command, an Exhortation, an Inſtruction, &amp;c. becauſe theſe are compoſed of Words. And as Men uſe to convey <hi>their Senſe</hi> to one another by Words, ſo God conveys <hi>his</hi> to Men by Chriſt, who is peculiarly and empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically ſtiled in Scripture, the <hi>Word of God;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John i. and Rev. xix. 13.</note> and as the Way Men receive Words from the Mouths of one another is by <hi>hearing,</hi> ſo the Manner by which the Soul receives internal Inſtruction, Reproof, &amp;c. from the Holy Spirit, is metaphorically called <hi>Hearing.</hi> Thus Faith, which is <hi>the Gift of God,</hi> is ſaid to come by <hi>hearing,</hi> and <hi>hearing</hi> by <hi>the Word of God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. x. 17</note> That is, I apprehend, the <hi>internal Senſe</hi> itſelf is opened in the Soul, as well as <hi>Subjects</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, by the Spirit of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence we ſee, the <hi>Divine Legation</hi> to the <hi>Jews,</hi> conſiſted not in the outward written Law only. Nor were they kept in Ignorance of inward ſpiritual Religion, or of a future State of Rewards and Puniſhments. For, if ſo, to what Purpoſe did <hi>Moſes</hi> preſs the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their latter End upon them, with ſo much Fervency? <q>O that they were wiſe,<note place="margin">Deut. xxxii. 29.</note> that they underſtood this, that they would conſider their <hi>latter End.</hi>
                  </q> What material Conſideration ſhould their latter End, or Time of Death, be of, to ſuch as know no better
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:021391_0074_0FB369C054070788"/>but that it would be the Period of their Exiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence? Or why ſhould he <hi>command</hi> their Attention to the <hi>living Word of Faith, Chriſt</hi> in the Heart, as well as to the written Code? He was an eminently inſpired Prophet, and well knew that Salvation is <hi>by Chriſt alone;</hi> and that his inward ſpiritual Law, is as preferable to the exterior one, as the Subſtance is to the Shadow. Obedience to the outward temporal Law, had outward and temporal Promiſes; but Obedience to the inward ſpiritual Law, hath Promiſes of an internal and eternal Nature. By the Works of the firſt, no Man could be juſtified; but by the Operation of the laſt, Sanctification is wrought, and Salvation expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced. <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Type of Chriſt, and the temporal Law, with its temporal Rewards, a Type of the Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus, and its eternal Recompence.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But it may be queried; if the ſpiritual Law was always afforded, what Occaſion was there for the Addition of temporal Statutes? Anſw.

               <p>Seeing their habitual Attachment to the Forms and Superſtitions of <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> was too ſtrong to admit of their being willingly and clearly brought out of them at once, Divine Wiſdom condeſcended to meet them in the State they were in, and to proceed gradually with them, by allowing them ſome Forms and Ceremonies like to thoſe they had been inured to; but more regular and ſignificant.

               <p n="1">1. AFTER the Wonders of Creation and Providence were diſplayed, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing and eſtabliſhing the ſtupendous Syſtem of external Nature, its great Author was pleaſed, at diſtant Periods, to ſhew forth the viſible Effects of his miraculous Power amongſt the Sons of Men; but when the Time came wherein he ſaw fit to recal the degenerate World from the Corruptions it was immerſed in, by a public Aſſumption and Manifeſtation of his own juſt Dominion amongſt a People <hi>choſen</hi> for that Purpoſe, he raiſed up the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> as an Exemplar to the reſt of Mankind. He brought them out of their <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Bondage by an high Hand, and through many admirable Strokes of his Power; and upon his Inſtitution of the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Law, which being the Introduction of a new Form of <hi>Theocracy,</hi> unknown to the World, it was requiſite it ſhould be attended by ſuch extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Marks of Divine Authority, as might
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:021391_0083_0FB369D5E5855CA8"/>be ſufficient to authenticate and inforce it, as coming from himſelf. He therefore, on that great Occaſion, appeared to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in a Manner anſwerable to his Almighty Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty; and alſo to the Nature and Solemnity of that Law; which being a Miniſtration of Condemnation, was uſhered in by the moſt dreadful and aſtoniſhing Tokens of Terror; with Thundrings and Lightnings, Blackneſs, Darkneſs, and Tempeſt, the Mountain flaming with Fire, the alarming Sound of the Trumpet, waxing louder and louder, and the Voice of Words ſo terrible, that not only the People, but the whole Mountain quaked exceedingly. This being an obvious, and moſt ſolemn Act of the ſupreme Legiſlator of the Univerſe, no leſs Authority than his own, could either aboliſh, or alter it, and when the Period arrived, wherein he ſaw fit to ſet aſide, and ſuperſede this Law of outward and carnal Ordinances, by bringing forward into full View, and <hi>ſole Obligation,</hi> the Subſtance pointed to by it, his ſpiritual and more excellent Covenant; it was neceſſary that it ſhould appear to be done, by clear Demonſtrations of the ſame ſovereign Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in as public a Manner, and at the moſt proper Seaſon for it. Accordingly the gracious Diſpenſation of the Goſpel was introduced by Evidences of Divine Authority equally extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, and equally ſuited to its placid and falutary Nature.</p>
               <p>Beſides the numerous Predictions of the Prophets concerning the Meſſiah, the Advent of his Forerunner the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Conception of our Saviour by the bleſſed Virgin, witneſs the many wonderful Works
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:021391_0084_0FB369D75DF49058"/>he performed, the unaccountable Darkneſs, and the rending of the Veil of the Temple throughout from Top to Bottom, upon his giving up the Ghoſt, denoting the Separation, Concluſion, and paſſing away of all Sign and Ceremony, and the Diſcloſure of the Subſtance in Spirit and Truth; his aſtoniſhing Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and that of the Bodies of buried Saints which aroſe and went into the City; and his viſible Aſcenſion, attended with the glorious Miniſtration of Angels. After all this, at the Time of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Feaſt of <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt,</hi> annually obſerved in Memorial of the giving forth of the Law on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> the Apoſtles and Diſciples, Male and Female, being aſſembled together, according to the Lord's Command, the Holy Spirit gave a two-fold Demonſtration of its Advent, as the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrative Power of the Chriſtian Diſpenſation, then to commence without any Mixture of a legal or ſhadowy Nature; firſt, by the Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of cloven Tongues, as of Fire, which ſate upon <hi>each</hi> of them. Second, by filling their Hearts with the Holy Ghoſt,<note place="margin">Acts ii.</note> to ſuch a Degree, that they began to ſpeak with other Tongues, or in other Languages beſides their own, as the Spirit gave them Utterance. Indued with Heavenly Wiſdom and Power, and infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with Divine Love and Fervour, they were now qualified to put in Practice the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion before given, in a verbal Manner, by the great Lord and Lawgiver. To <hi>divers</hi> of them were likewiſe added, the miraculous Powers of healing all Manner of Diſeaſes; the Dumb were made to ſpeak, the Deaf to hear, the Lame to walk, the Blind to ſee; Demoniacs
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:021391_0085_0FB369E02DABB620"/>were diſpoſſeſſed, and the Dead were raiſed and reſtored to Life.</p>
               <p>But theſe extraordinary Powers were neither conferred upon all, nor confined to the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles only; yet <hi>a Meaſure of the ſame Spirit</hi> was communicated to <hi>every one of them, Women as well as Men;</hi> otherwiſe <hi>Peter</hi>'s Application of the Prophecy of <hi>Joel</hi> had not been true. They were <hi>all</hi> filled with the Holy Ghoſt, but diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently gifted, and qualified by it, for different Services, according to the Will and Wiſdom of the great Diſpenſer.<note place="margin">1 Cor. xii. 8, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <q>To one is given <hi>by the Spirit</hi> the Word of Wiſdom; to another the Word of Knowledge by the ſame Spirit; to another Faith by the ſame Spirit; to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Gift of Healing by the ſame Spirit; to another the working of Miracles; to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prophecy; to another diſcerning of Spirits; to another divers Kinds of Tongues; to another the Interpretation of Tongues. But <hi>all theſe</hi> worketh that <hi>one and the ſelf ſame Spirit, dividing to every Man ſeverally as he will.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it appears, that what are commonly called Miracles, are not neceſſary or eſſential to Divine Inſpiration, but only <hi>adjunctive Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi> of the Spirit thereto, which have been occaſionally ſuper-added, and therefore may either totally ceaſe, when the Occaſions for which they were added are over, or continue to be uſed as it ſhall appear requiſite to Divine Wiſdom. When therefore the Goſpel was ſo far ſpread and eſtabliſhed, in the Parts then intended, that the End for which thoſe extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Powers were afforded was anſwered they were gradually withdrawn from the Church;
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:021391_0086_0FB369E1E02DA7D8"/>which was left, in the general, upon its proper and permanent Bottom, the <hi>immediate Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Holy Spirit.</hi> No Neceſſity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can be pleaded for the conſtant Continuance of miraculous Powers, or ſuch a Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, as ſignifies a peculiar Gift of foretelling future Events; but only of thoſe <hi>ſupernatural Influences,</hi> which are requiſite to enlighten, quicken, regenerate, ſanctify, bring forth the Fruits of the Spirit in Man, enable him to fill up his Duty, and finally prepare him for a Coeleſtial Manſion. <hi>Theſe</hi> are indiſpenſably neceſſary to be continued. They are of moral Conſideration, and immediately influential to the Preparation and Salvation of every Man, which Miracle and Prediction are not.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Notwithſtanding manifeſt Appearances of extraordinary Power were added, both to the Introduction of the Law, and that of the Goſpel, they are not to be conſidered <hi>as Parts</hi> of either, but <hi>as Sanctions</hi> requiſite to their Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; ſo I believe, ſome divine Exertions of a miraculous Nature have been evidenced, at Times, under both Adminiſtrations, as well as before them; either for the Convincement of doubtful Perſons, or to give additional Weight and Authority to the Miniſtry of ſome inſpired Servants of God, amongſt thoſe preſent with them, or to encourage and confirm them in their Service. Though I doubt not but this hath ſometimes been the Caſe ſince the firſt Century, and may remain to be ſo to the End of Time, for neither the Power nor Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Almighty is ſhortened; yet I am alſo of Opinion, that miraculous Appearances have been leſs publick, and more ſparingly
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:021391_0087_0FB369E397CEA678"/>afforded ſince the firſt Century than before it; which may be in Part owing to the Declenſion of the profeſſing Churches. I alſo believe, according to the prophetic Declarations of the. Apoſtles, that under the declined and darkened State of both Teachers and Hearers, many ſtrange Signs, and lying Wonders have been, and ſtill may be ſuffered to be impoſed upon the Credulity of a diſobedient People, by falſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders, for the Support of a corrupt Intereſt, and the Aggrandiſement of the Conductors. Undoubtedly, thoſe myſterious Deluſions have been abundantly more numerous for many Centuries paſt, than the Exertions of Divine Power in an extraordinary Way.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Continuation of exterior Miracles is not eſſential to the Miniſtration of the Goſpel; for was it ſo, Chriſtianity could not ſubſiſt without them. Yet, though they are not of abſolute Neceſſity thereunto, they may be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally uſed, or not, as the Sovereign Wiſdom ſees meet. But that they are ſtill conſtantly, or periodically continued in any particular Church, as a peculiar Mark of its being the only true Church of Chriſt, above all others, I find no Warrant to believe. Pretenſions of this Kind, naturally put thinking Minds upon looking for a ſuperior Excellency in the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, and Practices of ſuch a Church; and when they find it abound in Superſtition and Pomp, coercive Impoſition, proud Hierarchy, Craft, Lucre, and Idolatry, even bordering upon Politheiſm; for what elſe is the Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saints, and Sinners under that Title, by attributing a Kind of Omnipreſence, and Influence in the Court of Heaven to them?
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:021391_0088_0FB369E563936FE8"/>When they find theſe, and other monſtrous Abſurdities in the eſtabliſhed Doctrines of ſuch a Church, inſtead of the Simplicity, Purity, Humility, Love and Life of the Goſpel; what can they conclude of thoſe Pretenſions, but that they are the deceitful Juggles of Impoſture, and the Legends of Folly? The very Ends moſt of them are calculated to anſwer, ſufficiently evidence their Falſhood, and ſhew, whatever they are, that they are not Divine.</p>
               <p>It doth not appear, that in the primitive Age of Chriſtianity, thoſe who were ſometimes attended with miraculous Powers, were always ſo accompanied in their Miniſtry; nor that all inſpired Miniſters were ever enabled to work Miracles in the Sight of the People. Seeing therefore it is evident, that theſe extraordinary Powers are not eſſential to an inſpired Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, they are not the neceſſary Proofs of it; nor the Want of them an Argument, that a Miniſter is not inſpired. But though theſe are not eſſential to Chriſtianity, <hi>immediate Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is conſtitutionally ſo.</hi> The <hi>Excellency</hi> of the Goſpel Diſpenſation is, that it is not a Mixture of Sign and Subſtance, as that of the <hi>Jews</hi> was, nor a temporary, but <hi>a ſtanding Miniſtration of the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Seeing no further Change of Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is ever to be made, nor any other Doctrine to be preached, but that of our Saviour and his Apoſtles, which upon its Commencement, received a miraculous Confirmation, ſufficient for its laſting Eſtabliſhment, People are not now to expect, or call for Miracles from thoſe who preach the Chriſtian Doctrine; but to turn to, and attend upon that Divine Principle
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:021391_0089_0FB369E967555218"/>pointed out in the Scriptures, as manifeſted in the Breaſt of each Individual, the Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt in Spirit. This will give the ſincere and humble Receiver more clear and particular Demonſtration than outward Signs and Tokens could do; for the Powers whence theſe proceed, may be diſputed, but the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Evidence of the Light of Chriſt, the Life of Men, as rightly waited for, and adhered to, leaves no Doubt in the Mind concerning its Divine Nature and Authority. Hence <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> aſſerts, in the Words of the primitive Proteſtants, there is no Need now of outward Miracles to avouch the Doctrines of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; yet acknowledges, that ſome did appear upon its Revival in the laſt Century. But to return.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> iii. ſhews that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Goſpel far excels that of the Law, and that its Excellency ſtands in its <hi>Spirituality.</hi> Having ſpoken of the Law,<note place="margin">2 Cor. iii. 8, 9, 10, 11.</note> Verſe 7, he ſubjoins, <q>How ſhall not the <hi>Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit</hi> be rather glorious? For if the Miniſtration of Condemnation be Glory, much more doth the Miniſtration of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs exceed in Glory. For even that which was made glorious, had no Glory in this Reſpect, by Reaſon of the Glory which excelleth. For if that which <hi>was done away</hi> was glorious, much more <hi>that which remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> is glorious.</q> Why is the Goſpel thus ſuper-eminent above the Law, ſeeing that was a Divine Inſtitution? Principally, becauſe it is not an outward Code as the Law was,<note place="margin">2 Cor. iii. 3.</note> but an inward Law of Life, <q>written, not with Ink, but with the Spirit of the living God,

               <p>Without being born again of the Spirit,<note place="margin">John iii.</note> no Man can enter the Kingdom of God, and without the Spirit, no Man can be born of it; conſequently the Spirit is altogether as requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to us as it could be to the Primitives. It is no more in our Ability to regenerate and prepare ourſelves for the Kingdom, than it was in theirs. No Powers, natural or acquired, in our unregenerate State, are ſufficient for ſo great a Purpoſe, and to enable us truly to ſay, with the People of God in former Times,

               <p>Without the Spirit, no Man can be a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Spirit. The apoſtolic Direction is, <q>As every Man hath received the Gift,<note place="margin">1 Peter iv. 10, 11.</note> even ſo miniſter the ſame one to another, as good Stewards of the manifold Grace of God.

               <p n="6">6. Every true Believer and faithful Follower of Chriſt, in the apoſtolic Age, received a Portion of the ſame Holy Spirit which the Prophets and Apoſtles did, though in leſs Degrees; "for," ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. xii. 13.</note> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>by one Spirit are we all baptized into one Body,</hi> whether we be <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> whether we be bond or free; and have been <hi>all made to drink into one Spirit.</hi>
                  </q> This one Spirit rendered them one Body, and joined them to the one living Head. <q>There is one Body and one Spirit,<note place="margin">Eph. iv. 4, 5, 6.</note> even as ye are called in one Hope of your Calling; one Lord, one Faith, one Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and <hi>in you all.</hi>
                  </q> Thus, according to the ſeveral Meaſures allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, they were all Partakers of the ſame Holy Spirit, and as it was then, ſo it is now, and ever muſt be in the true ſpiritual univerſal Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Goſpel Sun aroſe in great Splendor, yet it appeared not in its full Meridian at once, to any. The Openings of Truth in the Minds of the primitive Chriſtians, Apoſtles as well
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:021391_0092_0FB369EE5A231DC8"/>as others, were gradual. As they advanced forward in the new Nature, they ſaw further and further. For a Time, they occaſionally circumciſed, entered into Vows, anointed with Oil, baptized with <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm; all which were of an external and legal Nature. Nay, at firſt, they perceived not the Holy Ghoſt was to be given to <hi>Gentiles</hi> as well as <hi>Jews,</hi> though <hi>Joel</hi> had plainly propheſied, it ſhould be poured out <hi>upon all Fleſh.</hi> But afterwards, as their Concern continued to preſs forward, they were led beyond the firſt initiatory Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Things; they ſaw clearly and declared, that <hi>the Holy Spirit fell upon the</hi> Gentiles,<note place="margin">Acts xi. 18.</note> as well as <hi>Jews;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. v. 6.</note> that <hi>neither Circumciſion nor Uncircumciſion availeth;</hi>

               <p n="8">8. It is no uncommon Thing to hear the apoſtolic Age ſtiled the <hi>Infancy</hi> of Chriſtianity; and ſo it was in Point of Time, and alſo in Reſpect to the temporary Continuation of a few Exteriors, not immediately ſeen through, and afterwards retained for a Seaſon, in Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcention to thoſe new Believers, who had been ſo much attached to ſymbolical Practices, they could not readily be brought to diſuſe them. And, in our Day, many of the preſent Leaders
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:021391_0093_0FB369F2F50647A0"/>and Rulers, in divers of the moſt numerous Churches profeſſing the Chriſtian Name, ſeem to imagine, that though the Aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt was neceſſary to the Introduction, and Support of the Chriſtian Religion in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Times, it has no Need of it now. It is become ſo matured by Man's Wiſdom and Learning, which had no Share in its Origin, that it is fully capable to go alone. So that <hi>now</hi> it is, in great Meaſure, become another Thing, and ſtands upon another Foundation, than formerly. Though it ſtill calls Chriſt its Head, and accounts itſelf his Body, it receives no immediate Direction from him, nor feels the Circulation of his Blood, which is the Life and Virtue of true Religion. Thus deſervedly incurring the Reproof of the Apoſtle implied in this Query, <q>Having begun in the Spirit,<note place="margin">Gal. iii. 3.</note> are ye now made perfect by the Fleſh?</q> In Truth, it too evidently appears, in a general View, the profeſſed Chriſtian Churches, inſtead of being in the Maturity of Chriſtianity, are greatly in the Decline from that State; or they could not be ſo inſenſible, nor durſt appear ſo oppoſite to the Life of Religion, as to reject and decry the <hi>vital Part</hi> of it, and treat it as <hi>extinct, unneceſſary,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>inſenſibly,</hi> to be now received; as too many of their Leaders and Members do. Surely a Church in this Condition, is properly entitled to that Addreſs of the Spirit, to the degenerate Church of <hi>Sardis;</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>I know thy Works,</hi>

<pb n="92" facs="unknown:021391_0094_0FB369F5A03FF370"/>with a ſuperficial Kind of Chriſtianity, I hope, and verily believe, there are many living and ſenſible Members of the Body of Chriſt in thoſe Churches.</p>
               <p>The Vitality and Glory of Chriſtianity lies in the clear Adminiſtration of the Holy Spirit, without any Veil of legal or ritual Adumbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. School-learning is but an human Accompliſhment, and though very uſeful as a Servant, is no Part of Chriſtianity. Neither the Acquirements of the College, nor the Formalities of human Authority, can furniſh that Humility which fitteth for God's Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Poſſeſſed of Arts and Languages, weak People are puffed up with a Conceit of Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority, which leads from Self-denial and the daily Croſs, into Pride and Self-ſufficiency; and inſtead of waiting for, and depending upon the Wiſdom and Power of God, into a Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the Wiſdom of this World, and a devotional Satisfaction in the Rote of external Forms and Ordinances. Whereas thoſe that <hi>worſhip God in the Spirit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. iii. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>rejoice in Chriſt Jeſus, and have no Confidence in the Fleſh.</hi> And why? Becauſe <hi>it is the Spirit that quickeneth;</hi>

                  <hi>the Fleſh profiteth nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whoſoever deny that the Holy Spirit, and its internal Operations, are now to be ſenſibly experienced, only demonſtrate their own Inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility thereof. The true People of God in all Ages, have declared their own undoubted Senſe of Divine Illumination and Help, and the Apoſtle, in <hi>Rom.</hi> vii. and viii. before cited, teſtifies he had a ſtrong, clear, diſtinguiſhing Senſe of the Holy Spirit throughout its Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. As it was then, it now is, and muſt
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:021391_0095_0FB369F6F2724878"/>remain to be, ſo long as Men are upon Earth. The ſame Work, in due Meaſure, is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to every one, and the like Senſe of it proportionably clear and certain to all who experience Regeneration. No Man can obtain Felicity out of God's Kingdom, nor can any enter the Kingdom without being born of the Spirit, neither is the Work of the New-birth wrought inſenſibly in any. Whatever <hi>Medium incognitum,</hi> or <hi>unknown Means</hi> Men imagine, inſenſible Operation is not Regeneration. It is a mere Deception. The Holy Ghoſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it operate by Words and Inſtruments, or without them, always comes <hi>in Power;</hi> a Power which gives an undeniable Senſe of it, perfectly diſtinct from, and above all other Powers, and with a Perſpicuity, at Times, as far exceeding all natural Lights, as the radiant Sun does the faint Glimmer of the Glow-worm.</p>
               <p>This Holy Spirit of Divine Light, and Power of Life, is the great fundamental Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of the reproached <hi>Quakers,</hi> and the only true ſaving Principle for all Mankind.

                     <hi>1. S.

This largely ſhewn in Variety of Matter to the End of this Chapter.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. HAVING endeavoured plainly to ſhew what the leading Principles of the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> are, and that they are the genuine Doctrines of true Chriſtianity, I ſhall now proceed to take more particular Notice of
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:021391_0097_0FB369F9F07C1818"/>divers material Parts of my Opponent's Treatiſe.</p>
               <p>His inſiſting that the <hi>Quakers</hi> Doctrine cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the reprobationary Scheme, and that <hi>Barclay</hi> was <hi>as much</hi> a Predeſtinarian as <hi>John Calvin,</hi> is merely his own Miſtake. He grounds it not upon their Doctrine, but what he improperly imagines to be ſo. Page 14, he ſays, <q>
                     <hi>Barclay</hi> and his Friend <hi>ſpeak of no Divine Aſſiſtance which enables Perſons to be paſſive,</hi> that the Light within may operate and ſave.</q> Whereas, in my Obſervations, P. 82, I quote <hi>Barclay,</hi> ſaying, <q>As Man is <hi>wholly unable</hi> of himſelf to work with the Grace, neither <hi>can he move one Step</hi> out of the natural Condition, <hi>until the Grace of God lay hold upon him,</hi> ſo, it is poſſible to him to be paſſive, and not reſiſt it, as it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for him to reſiſt it.</q> That is, <hi>by the Power of Divine Grace laying hold of, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluencing the Spirit of Man, it firſt becomes poſſible for him to be paſſive, and not reſiſt its Operation;</hi> which is the <hi>firſt Step</hi> Man takes in the Way of Salvation. "Without me,"<note place="margin">John xv. 5.</note> ſaith our Saviour, "ye can do nothing." I therefore added, <q>Man cannot ſet <hi>one ſingle Step</hi> towards his Salvation, without the Aſſiſtance of the Grace of God, as the <hi>firſt moving,</hi> and <hi>continually enabling Cauſe,</hi> both of the <hi>Will</hi> and the <hi>Deed.</hi>
                  </q> So that though <hi>Paſſiveneſs</hi> is the Beginning of the Work, he is <hi>previouſly diſpoſed to it</hi> by Virtue of the Holy Spirit. This manifeſts the Untruth of <hi>S. N</hi>'s Aſſertion, P. 212, and the Nullity of all his Reaſonings from it, that <q>the Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſt <hi>will not ſuffer</hi> the Honour of the firſt
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:021391_0098_0FB36A00235B9AF0"/>Step of the Soul towards Salvation to be aſcribed to the Light or Grace within.</q> On the contrary we attribute the Whole of Man's Salvation to it, firſt and laſt, without at all placing Man's Deſtruction to the Account of his Maker; which <hi>John Calvin</hi> directly doth.</p>
               <p>What our Doctrine teacheth is, 1. That Man has no Ability to ſave himſelf, is not naturally in a State of equal Freedom to Good or Evil at his Pleaſure, nor is in Poſſeſſion of that Faith which is neceſſary to his Salvation. 2. That the Redeemer affords a Manifeſtation of his Spirit to the Soul of every Man, by which, at Seaſons, he checks his corrupt Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, ſtops them in their Career, and puts it in his Power to reflect upon his preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and <hi>become paſſive</hi> to the Operation of this inward Principle. If he reſiſt it not, but ſtant in Submiſſion, it takes further Hold of him, gives him ſo <hi>to believe in it,</hi> as to ſuffer it in ſome Degree to unite with, abide in, and operate upon him. In this Situation, he feels Strength and Comfort ſpring up from it, which increaſeth his <hi>Faith and Truſt</hi> therein, and gradually enables and engages him to <hi>become active;</hi> that is, to join heartily in Concurrence with its Operations, and to proceed from Faith to Faith, and from one Degree of Grace to another, till he attain to know the New-birth of the Spirit, and to participate in Degree of the glorious Light, Life, and Nature of the Heavenly Kingdom.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God hath made Man a reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and therefore requires a willing Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of him, in order to the high Reward of
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:021391_0099_0FB36A015E28CF58"/>eternal Felicity; and if he repeatedly viſits all with the Reaches of his Grace, and continues Time after Time to convict, perſuade, and wooe, as the Scriptures declare, that he may prevail upon him to come to Repentance; doth he not go as far as reaſonable Creatures can claim, without violating the rational Liberty he affords? Let Man but yield Obedience to his Convictions, and ſee if he can charge his Creator with Partiality, or hard Meaſure. It is the unprofitable and unprofiting Servant that doth this.</p>
               <p>Education and Tradition do certainly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs, and give a Bias to the Mind againſt every Doctrine different to thoſe it hath been taught; but the Divine Light, at Times, darts in upon the Soul unawares, as quick as Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, penetrates through all its Darkneſs and every falſe Colour, diſturbs it in its polluted Reſts, and carnal Gratifications, ſhews its Bondage under them, and inſpires the ſecret Wiſh and heaving Sigh to be delivered, attended with ſome Degree of Reſolution againſt them. This being the opening of Divine Light upon the Mind, is called <hi>the Day of God's Viſitation,</hi> the <hi>Time of Grace unto Man;</hi> wherein <hi>Life and Death</hi> are diſtinguiſhed in him, and Liberty is not only given him to chuſe Life, which he could not do before, but alſo a ſuitable Meaſure of Ability to love and cleave to the <hi>Grace,</hi> he is viſited with, and thereby to come to Repentance, and be ſaved.<note place="margin">Tit. ii. 11.</note> For this <hi>Grace</hi> is the Spirit of the Saviour, and <hi>brings the Power of Salvation in it.</hi>

When Perſons are thus judicially hardened, and given up to their own Hearts Luſts, and beloved Deluſions, and leſt in a State of Inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of the Divine Principle, they may blindly miſtake it for Peace and Security. To ſuch, Conſcience becomes, for the preſent, obſcured, and as a Book ſhut up, wherein they cannot read; but in the Day of the righteous Retribution of the great Judge of Quick and Dead, this hidden Volume will again be unfolded, by him who openeth, and none can ſhut, and a juſt Diſtribution made to every one according to what is written therein (for it will prove either a Book of Life or of Death to every Man) to them who, by patient Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in well-doing, have ſought the Glory of God, their own Salvation, and the Good of others, Immortality and eternal Life; but to thoſe who have continued in Diſobedience and Rebellion againſt God, Tribulation and Anguiſh both inexpreſſible and interminable.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Can any reaſonable Creature think it poſſible, that the ſame Spirit and Power of Goodneſs which condeſcended to take our low Nature upon him, ſuffer in, and ſacrifice that Nature whilſt connected with it,<note place="margin">1 John ii. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>a Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Sins of the whole World,</hi> could ever intentionally conſign the Majority, or any Part of the ſame World, to unavoidable or uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Miſery? It appears from his Attributes of Truth, Equity, Wiſdom, Mercy, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, impoſſible that he ſhould either actually oblige any of his Creatures to ſin, that they might be miſerable; or, when he has created them, to deſert them to Sin and Miſery, by entirely with-holding from them that which is
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:021391_0102_0FB36A0873EEBD20"/>neceſſary to their Help and Preſervation. We therefore rationally conclude, that he doth not only ſet Good and Evil before Man in their juſt Diſtinctions, but at the ſame Time, enables him to <hi>chuſe</hi> which he will follow; and further, that he ſtirs up and aſſiſts Man to <hi>deſire</hi> after true Felicity, and as he abides in this Deſire, he <hi>empowers</hi> him to ſtrive, preſs, and wreſtle effectually for Deliverance and Preſervation.</p>
               <p>The primary Motions of Volition in the Mind being very nice and delicate, are not eaſy, if poſſible, for Men to form a preciſe Idea of, without the Light of God's Spirit; whence ſome have taken Occaſion to charge the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Diſpoſitions of Men towards the Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Divine Grace, to God's Account, by which they render him <hi>the primary Author of Evil,</hi> who by the ſpecial Peculiarity of his Eſſence, is too unchangeably perfect in all his Attributes, ever to warp from perfect Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. But is it not abſurd to ſuppoſe, that any intelligent Being can <hi>voluntarily</hi> produce what is contrary to its Nature; eſpecially an Omnipotent Exiſtence, whoſe Power muſt be irreſiſtable by all Objects and Occurrences? Is not Sin the Tranſgreſſion of God's Will, and Vice contrary to his Nature? How then could theſe be produced by an Act of his Will, or be the genuine Fruit of his Power, either mediately or immediately? Can a right Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding lead any Man to think, that <hi>the Will of God</hi> is poſſible at any Time to be <hi>contrary to his Nature?</hi>

               <p>From Purity, Goodneſs, and Virtue, no Impurity, Vice, or Evil could naturally ariſe. But that Text hath been objected,<note place="margin">Luke xvii. 1.</note> 
                  <q>It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:021391_0103_0FB36A09A2A406D8"/>but that Offences will come.</q> True; but whence come they? Not from God, but from that Root of Corruption, which hath entered and overſpread the World. Whilſt this corrupt Root remains, they will naturally ſpring from it; and the ſame Text pronounces, "Woe unto him through whom they come." "But God ſaith, I create Evil."<note place="margin">Iſa. xlv. 7.</note> And the Prophet ſaith, <q>Shall there be Evil in a City,<note place="margin">Amos iii. 6.</note> and the Lord hath not done it?</q> Moral Evil is not here intended, but the natural Evil of Pain and Diſtreſs, through Hoſtility, Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Famine, &amp;c. which are the Judgments of God upon Men for Diſobedience, and the Commiſſion of moral Evil.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To ſay, <hi>that God originally ſo conſtituted and ordered Things, that Evil muſt neceſſarily enſue in Conſequence of ſuch Conſtitution,</hi> is to treat him both as <hi>the deſigning</hi> and <hi>potential</hi> Author of all Evil. Wherein then are the wickedeſt Creatures, whether angelical or human, to blame? If they cannot be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than they are, nor act otherwiſe than they do; in Point of Equity, all their <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> is juſtified by the Neceſſity they are originally ſubjected to by their Creator; whom this Doctrine renders the real Author of <hi>it,</hi> either immediately or remotely. If God himſelf laid the Ground-work of all Evil, he muſt be the Author of all that follows by neceſſary Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence upon it.</p>
               <p>According to my Apprehenſion, <hi>Sin conſiſis in the Creature's preferring the Indulgence of its depraved Nature, to the Obedience of Divine Grace;</hi> which Indulgence leads it to the Abuſe of that Grace, and to think, ſpeak and act
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:021391_0104_0FB36A0B84412068"/>againſt the <hi>maniſeſted Will</hi> of its Creator. Neither the Origin, nor Continuance of Sin in the World, can be the Fruit of <hi>God's Will;</hi> for it always brings <hi>his Diſpleaſure</hi> upon the Creature. It is not the Effect, but the Cauſe of his Diſpleaſure. A Being perfectly Holy, Juſt, and Good, can neither do Evil, nor Delight in ſeeing his Creatures do it. It is contrary to his Nature, therefore againſt his Will, and what he could not ſuffer to originate without offering Means to prevent it, and ſhewing his Diſpleaſure with it; nor can he conſiſtently be conceived to extend perſonal Approbation or Averſion to any, excluſive of the State of the Parties reſpecting Good and Evil.</p>
               <p>That ſome obey, and others refuſe Obedience to the Manifeſtations of Divine Grace, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly true; and we believe, the Cauſe of this Difference is not of God, but entirely owing to the Man. Let him that doubts it, enquire in his own Conſcience. The faithful witneſs there, by its Condemnations for Evil, will plainly ſhew him, that the Fault is his own. What Man is there upon Earth without theſe compunctive Strokes? Who has not, alſo, felt at Times, Inclinations and Diſpoſitions excited in him towards Virtue and a good Life; and who knows not, that when he followed them, he found Peace in his Obedience; and when he turned from this ſalutary Purſuit to one of a contrary Nature, he incurred Trouble and Condemnation? Can a reaſonable Creature need further Proofs, that both thoſe convicting Reprehenſions and Comforts, are the internal immediate Adjudications of a juſt, good, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful,
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:021391_0105_0FB36A0CD867D550"/>omni-preſent, all-intelligent Principle? And <hi>what is this but God;</hi> and <hi>for what End doth he thus attend every Soul and Conſcience, but that all may come to Repentance, and experience Salvation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The firſt moving, true, and proper Cauſe of Man's Salvation, is the <hi>Goodneſs and Love of God</hi> to him. The <hi>eſſential Means</hi> by which he effects it, is the Operation of his own Holy Spirit on the Soul of Man, often immediately, and ſometimes inſtrumentally, by making uſe of exterior and incidental Things, and working by them as <hi>ſecondary</hi> Means; ſuch as Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reading the Scriptures, and other good Books, pious Converſation, Worſhip, Mercies, Diſtreſſes, &amp;c. After this Manner it pleaſeth Divine Wiſdom to exerciſe the Body in the Service of the Soul, whereby both are bettered divers Ways. It is God by his Holy Spirit, who worketh all Good in Man, both as to the <hi>Will</hi> and the <hi>Deed.</hi> It is by Grace we are ſaved, through Faith; or in the Way of Faith. That Faith which worketh by the Love of God to the Purifying of the Heart, and the Production of good Works. Theſe are the genuine Fruits of it, and inſeparable from it: Therefore without Works we cannot be ſaved. Yet it is not by the Works that we are ſaved, as <hi>the Cauſe</hi> of Salvation to us, but <hi>by Grace,</hi> through the Root of them, the Faith, by which we believe in God, open to, and receive him, cleave to him, truſt in him, and ſo lay hold of eternal Life. This Faith is not our Faculty, but the Gift of God to us. It comes by Grace, the free Grace of God, who is <q>

                  <q>Shew me thy Faith without thy Works, and I will ſhew thee my Faith by my Works,</q> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>James.</hi> Yet theſe Works do not render us <hi>meritorious</hi> of Salvation, for they are not to be attributed to us, but wholly to him who through his Grace, hath brought us into this bleſſed State of living Faith wherein they are produced.<note place="margin">Eph. ii. 8, 9, 10.</note>

               <p>I think I have already ſhewn, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Part of this Diſcourſe, that it is not only <hi>poſſible,</hi> but <hi>moſt probable</hi> to be otherwiſe; and now ſhall proceed to ſhew, it is impoſſible to be according to this Author's Aſſertion.</p>

               <p>If the Almighty, from the Beginning, <hi>ſo ordered his Creation,</hi> that Evil muſt neceſſarily enſue in it, it muſt be <hi>deſigned by him,</hi> or he would not have <hi>ſo ordered it,</hi> and every ſuppoſed Tranſgreſſor neceſſarily acts according to the Divine Will, in every Sin he commits, and the Divine Being takes Pleaſure firſt in his Sin, and

               <p>If Man be allowed no Choice, he can incur no Guilt. He muſt at ſome Time be at Liberty, or he can never do amiſs. If he do only what he is obliged to do, by a Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Things fixt by his Creator, he cannot ſin againſt him; for what he <hi>obliges</hi> him to do, he <hi>wills</hi> him to do, and it can be no Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion againſt him to do his Will; becauſe to ſin, is to offend him, and to offend him, is to act contrary to his Will. Whatever a Man doth from the Neceſſity of his Nature, let that Neceſſity be the Conſequence of the Lapſe of his firſt Parents, or not, if a Remedy be not in his Power, it is the ſame Thing to him. It was <hi>not himſelf</hi> that ſubjected himſelf to ſuch a faulty or defective Nature; therefore he cannot, in Equity, be condemned for what he could <hi>no Way help, or avoid.</hi> To aſſert, that a Perſon may be juſtly puniſhed for being what he is obliged to be, or doing what he is inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably forced to do by his Maker, may paſs upon blind inconſiderate People for <hi>Myſtery;</hi> but to others it muſt appear a manifeſt Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, and a moſt daring one, when attributed to the eternal Fountain of all Truth and Juſtice, a <hi>Reproach</hi> to him, and <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> againſt him.</p>

All that can be allowed is, that by forming reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and conſtituting them in a State of rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Freedom, he afforded them the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of making their Duty their Choice; but never willed them to abuſe it, by lapſing from the Grace he favoured them with for their Preſervation, dividing their Wills from his Will, and counteracting his ſalutary Laws; to whom they owed their Being, and on whom they muſt abſolutely depend for all the Good they ever could enjoy. And notwithſtanding he foreſaw they might be prevailed on to make a wrong Uſe of their Liberty, he certainly intended to favour them with Means amply ſufficient for their Recovery and Reſtoration. Though he forbore forcibly to hinder them from falling into Iniquity, he did all that could be done to prevent it in rational Creatures. He forewarned them againſt it, ſhewed them the dreadful Conſequence of it, and unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably armed them with Power, by his Spirit, to withſtand all Temptation to it, had they kept under it. He never could <hi>ſo permit,</hi> as <hi>to licence</hi> their Departure from their reaſonable Duty, and true Intereſt. By the Power and Goodneſs diſpenſed to Man, he might have ſtood without Sin; and now that he has fallen into it, by a Renewal of the ſame Power and Goodneſs ſtill afforded him, he may be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from it, and brought to Felicity.

10. We are told, <hi>The Will is always deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the ſtrongeſt Motive.</hi> Has the Will no Liberty then, at any Time? Is it always ſo forcibly determined, in all its Motions, by Circumſtances and Motives ſucceſſively ariſing upon it, from the original Conſtitution of Things, that every Man is neceſſarily obliged to think, ſpeak, and act juſt as he doth? <hi>No,</hi> it is anſwered, <hi>In temporal Matters the Mind has a Liberty of Choice.</hi> Why not in Spirituals as well as Temporals? How are the Motives and Circumſtances which determine the Will in temporal Concerns, more in its Power than thoſe that determine it in ſpiritual ones; and how do we know it to be ſo? Was this really the Caſe, our inevitable Acts would certainly render us no proper Subjects of Reward and Puniſhment; of Come, ye Bleſſed, or Go, ye Curſed. We muſt be equally unintitled to Approbation and Cenſure.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who alledge, that Motives ariſe from the Circumſtances we are placed in, and the Occurrences we meet with, which neceſſarily oblige us to think, ſpeak, and act as they impreſs our Minds, do not appear ſufficiently to conſider, that there is a Supreme All-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Controller of Circumſtances and Events, who can, and unqueſtionably doth, in due Seaſon, by his potential Influence upon the Mind of Man, counterbalance every other Influence. Can we think that he placeth Good and Evil, Life and Death before Men, as the Sacred Records teſtify, and calleth them repeatedly to chuſe Life and Good, and yet that he doth not enable them ſo to do? Every Divine Precept, every Exhortation, every
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:021391_0112_0FB36A1EA988A8F0"/>Command, every Commination, implies a Liberty afforded to the Subject, to comply or refuſe; to obey, or diſobey.</p>
               <p n="11">11. In the Suppoſition before us, the Will of Man is effectually deprived of all Freedom in his main Concern. For it is the ſame Thing to the Sufferer, whether the ſuperior Power ſubject him under this irreſiſtible Fata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, by an immediate and unalterable Decree, or by the Means of Motives and Inducements, ſo powerfully ſuited to his natural Inclinations and Paſſions, that he muſt neceſſarily be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with them. The Man is equally in Bondage either Way. To tell him, that his Will is free, becauſe he doth as he pleaſes when he acts agreeable to thoſe Motives, and the Diſpoſitions they neceſſarily excite, or enlarge, whilſt at the ſame Time, they are unvoidable by him, and ſo irreſiſtibly influential to his corrupt Inclinations, that they are rendered eagerly concurrent with them; to argue in this Caſe, that becauſe the Party purſues the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of his preſent Deſires, he acts upon a Principle of Freedom, is to aſſert an evident Falſhood. For, the Man is firſt deceived, overpowered, and ſo unwittingly captivated, that he cannot avoid willing the Evil he is inſnared into; and though he wills it, it is becauſe his Will is not at Liberty, but previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly deceived and captivated, though he ſees not how, and inſtead of being <hi>a moral Agent,</hi> is merely the <hi>Inſtrument</hi> of an unſeen ſuperior Power, who artfully obliges him to an evil Courſe, and to the Infelicity conſequent upon it.</p>

The Nature of Liberty ſuppoſes no abſolute Neceſſity, but ſuch a Freedom as may admit of Choice, without a pre-determining Power obliging one Way only. 'Tis true, the Powers of Men, as well as thoſe of all other Creatures, are neceſſarily limitted to their proper Sphere. No Creature can exceed the Bounds of its proper Element, yet it can act with Freedom therein, as a Bird in the Air, or a Fiſh in the Water; ſo Man, though unable to ſtretch beyond the Compaſs of Humanity, is enabled to act at Liberty within it; and I conceive, a wiſe and good Being, though Omnipotent, would not put any Reſtraint or Force upon him there, but for his Good. It is barbarous to ſuppoſe, he would reſtrain him from Good in order to his Hurt. <q>Far be it from God,<note place="margin">Job xxxiv. 10, 11, 23.</note> that he ſhould do Wickedneſs; and from the Almighty, that he ſhould commit Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. For the Work of a Man ſhall he render unto him, and cauſe every Man to find according to his Ways.—For he will not lay upon Man more than Right; that he ſhould enter into Judgment with God.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. I cannot perceive any Ground for a deſtructive Partiality in Almighty Wiſdom, and perfect Equity. Can he who prefers Mercy to Sacrifice, exalt Cruelty above Mercy? To ſppoſe, that the Supreme Excellence ſhould create all the Millions of Mankind of one Nature, and for eternal Duration, and that he ſhould, either immediately or remotely, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate a Minority of them to everlaſting Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and at the ſame Time determine to give the major Part no other Opportunity, but to be inevitably and eternally miſerable; is to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:021391_0114_0FB36A257B96B708"/>that there is more Cruelty than Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, more Rigour than Wiſdom, and more Inequality than Mercy in the Divine Nature. I therefore muſt conclude, that the Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is irrational, unjuſt, and groſsly injurious to the Divine Character.</p>
               <p>It is to be underſtood, that he who is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to act in this contrary Manner, towards his Creatures in the ſame State and Nature, doth it <hi>from one and the ſame Nature in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi> or that he is differently determined towards them, from two different Natures of contrary Diſpoſitions in himſelf? I am utterly unable to conceive how <hi>oppoſite Wills</hi> can ſubſiſt <hi>in the ſame Nature,</hi> and how two contrary Natures can exiſt in a Being of perfect and immutable Simplicity and Purity; or that ſuch contrary Procedures concerning his rational Creatures, can ariſe from Unity, Equity, and Goodneſs, in the utmoſt Perfection? But no Difficulty attends the Suppoſition, that <hi>the ſame Nature</hi> ſhould operate <hi>to different Effects</hi> upon Subjects in different Conditions. It is evident to every Man's Obſervation, that the moſt glorious inanimate Object of Creation, the Sun, by its Beams will ſoften Pitch and harden Clay; but theſe contrary Effects ariſe not from different Natures in its own Rays, but are different Effects of the ſame Beams, occaſioned by the contrary Diſpoſitions of the Pitch and Clay to receive them. So, I apprehend, the Holy Spirit operates differently on different Perſons, by reaſon of their different States and Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions to receive its Influences.</p>
               <p>It is not a little affecting, to behold Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations ſo injurious to the great Diſpenſer of
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:021391_0115_0FB36A26E2CAD088"/>all Good, ſet forth with Subtlety of Sentiment, and Elegance of Language, which can hardly fail to operate to the Deception and Hurt of thoſe who embrace and allow them a Place in their Minds. To aſſert, that God either or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally, or afterwards, <hi>diſpoſed the Courſe of Things, and State of Events in ſuch a Manner, that Sin muſt certainly and infallibly follow,</hi> is to render him the <hi>intentional</hi> and <hi>primary Author</hi> of all the Evil that enſues. For he that raiſes a Building, cauſeth it to be filled with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtibles, and ſets Fire to it by a Fuze, or a Train of Powder of the greateſt Extent, which muſt infallibly burn it down, is as certainly <hi>the Deſtroyer</hi> of the Edifice, as if he fired it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately without ſuch Means.</p>
               <p n="13">13. It hath been alledged, <hi>If God had not given Man Liberty, he could not have abuſed it.</hi> Very true. If the Artificer had not made, nor the Shop-keeper furniſhed the Suicide with the <hi>Knife</hi> he cut his Throat with, he could not have miſuſed <hi>it;</hi> but is he who made or ſold it him, <hi>for better Purpoſes,</hi> intitled to any Part of his Guilt? Without Liberty Man could not have ſinned, and without the Knife the Suicide could not have made ſuch a ſelf-injurious Uſe of it; yet it is not the Knife, nor thoſe who furniſhed it; neither is it the Liberty, nor he who afforded it; but the ill-conceived Diſpoſition of the Perpetrator from whence the Default ariſeth, and to which it is in Juſtice, wholly to be imputed.</p>
               <p n="14">14. All the Souls that God has made, are equally his; and he <hi>whoſe Mercies are over all his Works,</hi> overlooks none of his Creatures in the Diſtribution of his Mercies. He with|
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:021391_0116_0FB36A285EED4838"/>holds his Talents from none, but diſpenſeth them in different Portions to different Perſons; that ſocial Communication and Connection may be preſerved amongſt us in this Life. To One he gives five Talents; to a Second, two; to a Third, one; but to every one a Degree of Divine Manifeſtation ſufficient, if believed in and obeyed, to operate to his Salvation. He juſtly requires a Profiting anſwerable to the Meaſure he affords; and as he perfectly knows to what Degree of Improvement each might have attained, he will finally judge all accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Increaſe, their Negligence, or their Rejection of the Talent received.</p>
               <p n="15">15. The rational immortal Soul, is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally and eſſentially the Man. This, as I have already ſhewn, is the immediate Creation of God, and deſcended not from <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> nor paſſeth from Parents to Children, like the mortal Body; and ſeeing it never was in them, it never ſinned in them. The Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of <hi>Preterition</hi> therefore, which ſuppoſes, that all ſinned when <hi>Adam</hi> tranſgreſſed, and <hi>deſerve Condemnation</hi> for the Sin he committed, and thence concludes, that God doth juſtly with-hold his ſaving Grace from the Majority of Mankind; is a Concluſion drawn from <hi>untrue Premiſes,</hi> and conſequently <hi>a falſe Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.</hi> Firſt to create the rational Soul, and then to forſake it, is not <hi>Preterition,</hi> but <hi>Dereliction.</hi> And this Doctrine is not only <hi>falſe,</hi> but <hi>dangerous.</hi> For when ſome feel the comfortable Touches of Divine Viſitation, inſtead of humbling themſelves under it, that the Work of Regeneration may go forward, <hi>this Opinion</hi> leads them to imagine it to be a Mark
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:021391_0117_0FB36A29DDA89338"/>of their Election, and perhaps to add other Marks to themſelves from miſtaken Scriptures; by which they increaſe their natural Pride, Self-conceit, and Preſumption, which defeat the good Intention of God's Grace towards them. Others of a melancholy Turn, when convicted and diſtreſſed in their Minds for Sin, are led by <hi>this Opinion,</hi> to think it a Mark of perſonal Reprobation, and thence into De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence, with all its diſmal Conſequences. Thus, what the merciful Creator intends for Men's Benefit, they turn to their own great Diſadvantage.</p>

It anſwers no good Purpoſe to increaſe Diſputation about Things hidden, or Texts obſcure and ambiguous; but this is certain, and certainly to be relied upon, that where the Almighty plainly declares his Will, reſpecting his Creatures, he who cannot be miſtaken, is ſurely to be credited in Preference to the Contra-poſitions of miſtaken Men, who preſume to interpret his Words ſo as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict his moſt clear, and moſt ſolemn Aſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verations.</p>

               <p>From all theſe expreſs Declarations, it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appears,<note place="margin">Lam. iii. 33.</note> that the Almighty <q>doth not afflict <hi>willingly,</hi> nor grieve the Children of Men;</q> that he is <hi>not willing</hi> that <hi>any</hi> ſhould periſh, but that <hi>all</hi> ſhould come to Repentance.<note place="margin">2 Pet. iii. 9.</note> Theſe are all plain Manifeſtations of the Mind of God profeſſedly on the Point, and to all who intend not to deny his Uprightneſs and Veracity they ought to be deciſive.

It is clear, he doth all that can be done by fair Means to prevent it.

               <p>Men are not deſtroyed through any Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence in their Creator towards them; but are ſaved by his Grace, which he diſpenſeth to all from that unparalleled Benevolence, which ariſeth purely from his Infinite Goodneſs.

Detachments of various Texts and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Scripture, though indirect to the Subject, and alluding to different Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, have been preſſed, and martialled under divers Colours, to fix a cruel Partiality on our common Creator and Benefactor.<note place="margin">Edwards, P. 358, &amp;c.</note> We are told, that he <hi>ordered</hi> the Obſtinacy of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> the Sin and Folly of <hi>Sihon,</hi> and the Kings of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the treacherous Rebellion of <hi>Zede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> againſt the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Rapine and Ravages of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> &amp;c. But properly conſidered, this was ordering Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Sin, not Sin for Puniſhment. He hardeneth none till they have hardened them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves paſt all Probability of Repentance, and then he leaves them to the Miſ-rule of their own beloved Luſts and Vices; and what are treated as unrighteous Ravages, though really ſuch in the Committers of them, are, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Almighty, the righteous Execution of his Juſtice againſt thoſe who have filled up
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:021391_0121_0FB36A3408CAAFC8"/>their Meaſure of Iniquity and abuſed his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Goodneſs and long Forbearance towards them, till he ſees fit no longer to continue it to them. Thus he puniſheth the <hi>ſettled Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs</hi> of ſome, by the Wickedneſs of their Enemies, which he permits to be turned upon them; and afterwards proceeds in like Manner with their Chaſtiſers, when they alſo have filled up their Meaſure.</p>
               <p>I ſhall omit at preſent to proceed further with the Scriptures alledged againſt the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Extenſion of Divine Goodneſs to the Souls of Men, and acknowledge my Inability to conceive, what <hi>wiſe, holy, and moſt excellent Ends and Purpoſes</hi> could be anſwered, by the <hi>Almighty's diſpoſing the State of Events in ſuch a Manner, that Sin will moſt certainly and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly follow,</hi> and eternal Miſery to innumerable Multitudes of his Creatures in Conſequence; and alſo <hi>what Glory</hi> can accrue to a Being infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in Wiſdom, Power and Goodneſs, from his <hi>continually</hi> creating immortal and reaſonable Creatures, with no better Intention towards them but that moſt barbarous one of irredeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Infelicity. I am alſo at a Loſs to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, what Comfort can ariſe to an humane, virtuous and charitable Mind from ſuch a cruel Conſideration. Thoſe Hearts muſt be very unfeeling for others, and their Conceit in their own Favour very ſtrong, who, fancying to themſelves a perſonal Election, can pride and conſole themſelves in their own imagined Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the inequitable Deſtruction of the major Part of their Species. Miſled Men, like the unprofitable Servant, may imagine ſuch unjuſt Severity in the unchangeable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:021391_0122_0FB36A35760BEC18"/>of Equity, but thoſe who have the Love of God ſhed abroad in their Hearts, by the Holy Ghoſt, find it to flow freely towards all Mankind without Exception, and to engage them to wiſh the Salvation of all. This is a ſtronger Proof to them of the Univerſality of God's good Will to Men, than all the ſophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Reaſonings of thoſe who remain inſenſible of it, to the contrary.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Before I leave this Subject, let me obſerve, that my Opponent, P. 198, after his uſual Manner of <hi>making Meanings</hi> for me, will have it, that according to ſome of my Expreſſions; <q>Mankind are by Nature, in ſuch a State, that if God does not afford them ſufficient Means of Salvation, <hi>he is unjuſt;</hi> ſurely then, there <hi>can be no Grace</hi> in his giving them theſe, for, whatſoever he is <hi>bound</hi> in Juſtice and Equity to beſtow, cannot be Grace. This is an Obſervation which carries <hi>its own Evidence</hi> with it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Every Obſervation carries <hi>its own Evidence</hi> with it, but it may not be a true Evidence. What I aſſert is, that as it would be an Act of Injuſtice and Cruelty, to create rational and ſenſible Souls, with no better Purpoſe towards them, than to render them inexpreſſibly and eternally miſerable, by continually ſupporting them in Being, and as continually with-hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that from them without which they never can be relieved; <hi>ſo it is impoſſible</hi> for God, who is moſt eſſentially and immutably Juſtice and Goodneſs itſelf, to act otherwiſe by his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures than according to Juſtice and Goodneſs; and therefore, that he cerrainly doth not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, but affords his Creatures the Means
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:021391_0123_0FB36A3711DFA348"/>neceſſary to their Felicity. I believe his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are over all, and to all, with a <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>gracious</hi> Intent towards them; and that the univerſal Redeemer purchaſed Gifts for thoſe who prove rebellious, as well as others, and that all are viſited with a Manifeſtation of his Spirit, that they may profit by it; and though they do lapſe from the viſiting Power, and often loſe the diſpoſing Aſſiſtances afforded them, he ſtill follows them, Time after Time, in long Forbearance, and often reviſits them, of his freely-abounding Grace and Mercy, that they may be prevailed upon to come to Repentance and be ſaved. Hence, according to common Phraſeology, we ſtile his univerſal primary Aſſiſtance an Act of Equity, and his nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Repetitions thereof Acts of Goodneſs; yet neither is the Firſt without Grace and Mercy, nor are the Latter void of Equity. As to that of God's being <hi>bound</hi> in Juſtice and Equity, I do not ſee the Propriety of that Language. I apprehend, he is not <hi>bound</hi> by any thing, but that he always acts in the <hi>perfect Freedom of his own Nature;</hi> which is that of <hi>Equity, Truth and Goodneſs.</hi> For, ſtrictly ſpeaking, I think it leſs proper to ſay, that he <hi>has</hi> what we mean by theſe Terms, than that he <hi>is</hi> what we intend by them; and as his Eſſence can never admit of the leaſt Imperfection, it is impoſſible he ſhould ever be, or act otherwiſe. It is therefore by a ſtrained and unjuſt Inuendo, that <hi>S. N.</hi> would infer from my Words, that irreverent upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kind of Expreſſion, <q>If God does not afford them ſufficient Means of Salvation, <hi>he is unjuſt.</hi>
                  </q> Should I follow his Manner
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:021391_0124_0FB36A3A40E1D868"/>of Reaſoning, I might as properly infer, that he holds Grace and Juſtice are incompatible with each other, and cannot poſſibly concur in the ſame Act; which, I think, he will hardly affirm. Doth not he, as well as I, aſſert that God's Acts are according to Juſtice? Will he allow me to ſay, that he therefore denies there is either Grace or Mercy in them? Should I put ſuch an Abuſe upon his Expreſſions, he would unqueſtionably beſtow the Severity of his Juſtice upon me; which I acknowledge he has often done with great Freedom, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any juſt Merit on my Part.</p>

The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they ground upon this imaginary Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, are ſufficient to impeach their Baſis; for they carry an evident Face of Falſhood.

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>1.</hi> The <hi>Quakers</hi> cleared of the Charge of their holding Anti-ſcriptural Principles. <hi>2. S. Newton</hi>'s reiterated Pretence to try their Doctrine by Right Reaſon, and the true Senſe of Scripture, a preſumptuous Vanity. The Scripture not clearly and fully underſtood without the Illumination of the Spirit that gave them forth. <hi>3.</hi> Authors cited to this Purpoſe. <hi>4. Barclay's</hi> Aſſertion defended. <hi>5.</hi> No Diſagreement or Claſhing in the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Degrees of Divine Evidence. <hi>6.</hi> The Infallibility of the Scriptures as given forth by the Spirit, and the Fallibility of human Underſtanding concerning them. <hi>7.</hi> None but the Divine Author able to aſcertain his own Senſe in the Scriptures. <hi>8.</hi> The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures rightly underſtood, a Rule; but not the ſole, the primary, and univerſal Rule. The Holy Spirit alone is ſuch. <hi>9.</hi> The Scriptures allowed to be the primary written Rule, to which, in all Diſputes, we therefore refer, as well as others; but the immediate Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of God's Spirit, is a more certain Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terion to each Individual in his own Breaſt.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. MY Opponent, in his Introduction, P. 3, and in ſeveral other Places, inſinuates, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> Syſtem is founded upon <hi>a ſuppoſed</hi> ſaving Influence of the Holy Spirit, <hi>without</hi> the Inſtrumentality of the Scriptures; and Page 4, he charges it upon them as an Anti-ſcriptural Principle. This he poſitively aſſerts, from which I muſt diſſent,
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:021391_0128_0FB36A429DDB2488"/>becauſe I underſtand the Religion of the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> ſtands not <hi>in Syſtem,</hi> nor is a <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> ſaving Influence of the Spirit any Part of their Doctrine, but <hi>a real experimental one;</hi> not <hi>always without,</hi> but <hi>often with</hi> the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentality of the Scriptures. I'll own myſelf obliged to him, if he will ſhew me where the Scripture either ſays, or fairly implies, that the Spirit is not to be received without their Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentality. How was the Spirit received by the Pen-men of the Scriptures, from Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to End,<note place="margin">2 Peter i. 20, 21.</note> when they <hi>wrote and ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt?</hi> I look upon this Aſſertion of <hi>S. N.</hi> as a fundamental Error; for, it is not only true, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures aſſert no ſuch Thing, but alſo that they plentifully inculcate the contrary, as will appear anon.</p>
               <p>Chriſt is with his true Followers, and will be to the End of the World. To ſay, he is always with them in the Scriptures, appears to me, too great a Strain of Language for Truth to accompany. If the Spirit of Chriſt be ſo connected with the Text, as always to attend it, I apprehend, no ſincere and ſenſible Reader could miſtake the Senſe of it, nor any ſuch differ to an Oppoſition of each other about it; yet what is more common? We have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently experienced, and <hi>always</hi> allowed, that the Spirit of Truth often uſeth, and openeth Truth by the Scriptures, as an inſtrumental Means; and we alſo aſſert, that the ſame Spirit often hath opened Truths, given a Senſe of their Conditions, and adminiſtered Help, to ſincere and attentive Minds, without the Inſtrumentality of the Scriptures. This is the
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:021391_0129_0FB36A46BA5CC7D8"/>univerſal Goſpel-privilege, foretold by <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi> through Divine Inſpiration.<note place="margin">Jer. xxxi. 33, 4.</note> 
                  <q>I will put my Law in their inward Parts, and write it in their Hearts, and will be their God, and they ſhall be my People. And they ſhall teach no more" (of Neceſſity) "every Man his Neighbour, and every Man his Brother, ſaying, know ye the Lord; for they ſhall all know me," (each Man for himſelf) <hi>from the leaſt of them to the greateſt of them,</hi> ſaith the Lord.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Is it rationally to be underſtood, that this Divine Internal Teacher, is ſo <hi>abſolutely bound</hi> to the Inſtrumentality of Scripture, in his <hi>immediate Legation</hi> to the Soul of Man, that he never opens or inſtructs without it? The Text implies no ſuch Matter. The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> (Anno Dom. 90) treats of this imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Teacher under the Title of <hi>an Unction from the Holy one.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 John ii. 20. 27.</note> 
                  <q>Ye have an Unction from the Holy one, and <hi>ye know all Things.</hi>
                  </q> That is, I take it, <hi>ye have the Spirit, which, as you "attend to it, gives you a right Diſcerning of all Things that concern you;</hi> for, <q>The Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which ye have received of him, <hi>abideth in you,</hi> and ye need not that any Man teach you; but as <hi>the ſame Anointing teacheth you of all Things,</hi> and <hi>is Truth,</hi>
                  </q> (the Spirit of Truth) <q>and is no Lie; and even, as <hi>it hath taught you,</hi> ye ſhall <hi>abide in him</hi> or <hi>it.</hi>
                  </q> This ſhews the complete <hi>Sufficiency</hi> of this inward, immediate Inſtructor, without any Inſtrumentality of an exterior Kind. The eternal <hi>Spirit of Truth</hi> cannot ſtand in Need of any ſuch Aſſiſtance; conſequently, is not to be underſtood as confined to any, but operates
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:021391_0130_0FB36A47E496BEB8"/>either by the Scriptures, or without them, at his Pleaſure.</p>
               <p>God hath always afforded Inſtruction to his People; but his Teachings by the Law to the <hi>Jews,</hi> were through inſtrumental Means. The Prophet declares,<note place="margin">Jer. xxxi. 31, 32.</note> this New Convenant of the Goſpel ſhould <hi>not be</hi> according to the Old Covenant of the Law; it ſhould not <hi>conſiſt</hi> of inſtrumental Teaching, though that might be <hi>occaſionally uſed;</hi> for <hi>God himſelf would put his Law in their inward Parts.</hi> This implics his own immediate Communication to the Soul, of that Law which is not according to the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Nature of the Old Covenant, but is really and truly, <hi>the Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> the illuminating quickening Law, immediately and mentally given to Man by <hi>the Spirit of Life itſelf;</hi> which therefore is, and ever muſt be, the <hi>conſtitutional Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the Goſpel-diſpenſation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> in a prophetic Addreſs to the Goſpel Church,<note place="margin">Iſa. liv. 13.</note> ſaith, <q>All thy Children ſhall be taught of the Lord.</q> In Reference to this, and other like Prophecies, our Saviour ſaith, <q>It is written in the Prophets,<note place="margin">John vi. 45.</note> and they ſhall be <hi>all</hi> taught of God. Every Man therefore that <hi>hath heard,</hi> and <hi>hath learned of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> cometh unto me." And in the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Verſe he ſaith,<note place="margin">V. 44.</note> "No Man can come to me except the Father who hath ſent me, draw him.</q> This <hi>drawing, hearing</hi> and <hi>learning</hi> of the Father, and <hi>coming to Chriſt,</hi> are all ſpiritually to be underſtood; as I have ſhewn in the former Part of this Diſcourſe.

But as touching Brotherly-love, ye need not that I write unto you; for <hi>ye yourſelves are taught of God,</hi> to love one another.</q> The Apoſtle was then writing to them <hi>mediately from God;</hi> by Divine Inſpiration, and he makes a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Difference between this mediate Manner of Teaching, and what he intended by <hi>their being taught of God;</hi>

               <p>By neceſſary Conſequence from theſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and Abundance more that might be added from the Scriptures, it appears to be both an experimental and a ſcriptural truth, that <hi>God teacheth immediately by his Spirit, as well as Inſtrumentally by external Means;</hi> and that this is an <hi>indiſpenſable Doctrine of the Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>S. N.</hi> ſets out, in his Letter, P. 4, with a Profeſſion to try the leading Principles of the <hi>Quakers</hi> by <hi>Right Reaſon, and Scripture,</hi> or as he afterwards expreſſes it, <hi>the true Senſe</hi> of Scripture. Upon this, I obſerved, that without Divine Illumination, Man has not ſufficient Ability to aſcertain the genuine Senſe of doubtful and diſputed Texts, which are very numerous, and mentioned in Proof, the Diverſity of Senſes wherein thoſe Texts, are underſtood, by Perſons apparently of equal Sincerity, and of the beſt natural and acquired Parts, under the ſame, as well as different Denominations, as plain Indications, that the
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:021391_0132_0FB36A4ADF34C500"/>Aſſiſtance of the Divine Author himſelf is requiſite to the right Underſtanding of them. I alſo ſhewed, that Man's Reaſon is too much clouded, and biaſſed by his Paſſions and Prepoſſeſſions, to be juſtly denominated <hi>Right Reaſon,</hi> and inſtanced its Diverſity concerning ſpiritual Matters, and its Mutability in the ſame Perſons; alſo that <hi>Right Reaſon is Truth, unchangeably the ſame, and incapable of Error,</hi> and therefore exiſts only in <hi>the Divine Nature,</hi> which Men muſt, in Meaſure, become Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of in order to the Rectification of their fallen and fallible Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Inſtead of either acknowledging, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving this, <hi>S. N.</hi> now profeſſes to bring the leading Sentiments of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> a ſecond Time, to the Bar of <hi>Right Reaſon</hi> and <hi>the true Senſe of Scripture;</hi> but he forgot that he ought, <hi>in the firſt Place,</hi> to prove, that he hath theſe <hi>infallible Criterions</hi> in Poſſeſſion. "A Man," ſays Sir <hi>William Temple,</hi> 
                  <q>that tells me my Opinions are abſurd or ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, impertinent or unreaſonable, <hi>becauſe they differ from his,</hi> ſeems to intend a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel inſtead of a Diſpute, and calls me Fool or Madman with a little more Circumſtance; though perhaps I paſs for One as well in my Senſes as he; as pertinent in Diſcourſe, and as prudent in Life.

Reſpecting the Scriptures, we are ſo far from leſſening them, or oppoſing the true Senſe of them, that we verily believe, and ſincerely aſſert, that the Holy Spirit, in what Degree of Illumination ſoever it appears, never can contradict them; for Difference in Degree makes no Contrariety. It is the <hi>private,</hi> or particular, <hi>Interpretation of Man without Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Illumination,</hi> that we object to, as inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to aſſure the Senſe of diſputed Scriptures. Beſides Man's natural Inability, the various Prejudices, the prevailing Paſſions, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Intereſts, and the diverſe Leaders of the People, all contribute to give different, and ſometimes oppoſite Senſes of the Sacred Text. Many have the Words of the Spirit in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who have not the Mind of the Spirit in their Hearts.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Neither Nature nor Education can give a Man the Senſe of the Holy Ghoſt, nor, of Conſequence, interpret its Expreſſions with Certainty. It is therefore truly aſſerted, not only by the <hi>Quakers,</hi> but alſo by Abundance of diſtinguiſhed Writers of various Profeſſions, ancient and modern, that the internal Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of God's Holy Spirit is abſolutely neceſſary to every Man, in order to his right Underſtanding of the Scriptures.

N.</hi> P. 5, ſeems ſo out of Temper with, that he treats them as bold Dictates, terrible Impoſitions, and enthuſiaſtic Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of fatal Tendency.</p>

                  <pb n="136" facs="unknown:021391_0138_0FB36A579D624338"/>
5. P. 7. He profeſſes to untie what he calls <hi>the Gordian Knot</hi> of <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> by obſerving, that the <hi>true Senſe</hi> of the Scriptures, is of equal Authority with Divine Manifeſtations, and that, as the Scriptures were given forth by the Apoſtles, whom we allow had the Spirit in a greater Degree than any in this Age, therefore he concludes, upon our Principles, the <hi>true Senſe</hi> of the Scriptures, is a nobler Rule of Judgment in Religion, than <hi>our own pretended</hi> inward Divine Revelations.</p>
               <p>We are well apprized of, and have always aſſerted, greater and leſſer Degrees of Divine Illumination have been communicated to diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Perſons; but we alſo believe there cannot be any Contrariety, Claſhing, or Diſſonance in any of its Degrees; becauſe it is from one and the ſame Spirit, and in what Degree ſoever it appears, it ſpeaks one and the ſame Thing, in point of Congruity, and carries its own Divine Authority with it in every Degree. Hence, to ſuppoſe a <hi>Diſagreement</hi> between one Degree of it and another, whilſt it can differ in nothing but Degree, is <hi>untrue</hi> and <hi>abſurd.</hi> As to <hi>our own,</hi> or <hi>any Man's own pretended,</hi> or <hi>any pretended</hi> Divine Revelations, we utterly and equally diſclaim, as being of any Authority, or Advantage whatſoever; for ſuch mere Pretenſions are altogether as unequal to diſcover and aſſure the <hi>true Senſe</hi> of dubious Parts of Scripture, as the unenlightened Reaſon of the natural Man. It is a vain Thing in any Perſon <hi>to pretend</hi> he has the <hi>true Senſe</hi> of the Holy Scriptures, whilſt his Performances demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate his Miſtakes concerning it; which is
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:021391_0139_0FB36A5B6E9D74D8"/>evidently the Caſe with our preſent Oppoſer, as I ſhall make more fully appear by and by.</p>
               <p n="6">6. When any preſs their own particular Opinion of the Senſe of any Part of Scripture, as the <hi>true Senſe</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt, yet deny all Senſe of the Holy Ghoſt in their Hearts, who that obſerves a Diverſity of Senſes amongſt theſe, can give Credit to their Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? But they alledge, <hi>the Scripture is infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible.</hi> I allow it; but how is its true Senſe to be infallibly conveyed to every Reader? By human Study and Inſtruction? That has led into all the Differences and Diſagreements about it. The plain Truth of the Matter is, nothing but the Spirit of Divine Wiſdom, whence the Scripture came, can give the genuine Senſe of it. For,<note place="margin">1 Cor. ii. 11.</note> 
                  <q>The Things of God knoweth no Man, but the Spirit of God.</q> What is the Infallibility of Scripture to him, who has not the infallible Senſe of it? If all had <hi>this,</hi> who have the Scriptures, none could miſtake them, nor differ with each other about them; yet it is too manifeſt, by the Differences among Chriſtians, they do miſtake them. This is not to be imputed to any Defect in the Sacred Writings, but to the common Unfitneſs of Men's Underſtandings to diſcover the right Senſe of them. What then can open it to Man's Capacity but the Holy Spirit?</p>
               <p>The Queſtion is not, whether the Scriptures, as written by Divine Inſpiration, are infallibly right, for ſuch muſt be ſo, but whether every one that reads them, is able infallibly to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them? To pretend, if they are not clearly to be underſtood without the Aſſiſtance of the Spirit, they are given in vain, is to contradict
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:021391_0140_0FB36A5D6B7F9AD8"/>the Scripture,<note place="margin">1 Cor. xii. 7.</note> which declares that, <q>The Manifeſtation of the Spirit is given to every Man to profit withal.</q> It may as truly be aſſerted, that the Divine Being, whilſt he knows we are in Darkneſs, gives us a Chart to direct our Way, and at the ſame Time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds the Light, by which alone we can diſcover its true Contents; which is merely to mock and tantalize us, and alſo to render our Situation worſe than that of the <hi>Jews;</hi> for all the written Precepts of their Law were plain and evident;<note place="margin">Neh. ix. 7.</note> yet <hi>God gave them of his good Spirit to inſtruct them; all</hi> the written Doctrines of the Goſpel <hi>are not ſo,</hi> and is not the Holy Spirit as requiſite to us as it was to them?</p>
               <p n="7">7. Scripture Doctrines are of divers Claſſes. They exhibit juſt Morals, and benevolent Conduct between Man and Man, in a Manner ſuperior to the beſt Ethic Writers in all Ages and Nations. Theſe are generally and juſtly allowed to be of natural, univerſal, and unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable Obligation, and are ſuſſiciently plain and clear to the common Senſe of every Man. But Matters relating to Faith and Worſhip, having admitted of many circumſtantial Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Alterations, according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Diſpenſations of Divine Wiſdom, have not been ſo level to Men's Underſtandings, nor have they been ſo united in Judgment concerning them, as in the Caſe of moral Duties. Ever ſince the collected Publication of the New Teſtament, Differences in Opinion about the true Senſe, eſpecially in Matters of Faith, have ſubſiſted and abounded; and what can determine theſe Differences? The learned <hi>A.</hi> ſaith, ſuch a Text means ſo and ſo. The
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:021391_0141_0FB36A5E61FB2478"/>learned <hi>B.</hi> aſſerts, it is to be accepted in a different, perhaps a contrary Senſe. They apply to the Context, and remain ſtill as diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in Opinion, and as poſitive of being in the Right. They recur from Text to Text, and from Critic to Commentator, till they have exhauſted every one they can find, or force to their Purpoſe, and ſtill remain equally, if not more at a Diſtance than at the Beginning. What is there left to determine the Matter? Will Churches or Councils do it? They jangle from Year to Year, or from Age to Age, and leave the Difference as wide as they found it. The <hi>true Senſe</hi> ſtill remains only with the Divine Author of the diſputed Texts, and he alone is able to communicate it. Would it not be a wild Preſumption in either <hi>A.</hi> or <hi>B.</hi> to boaſt that he'll try his Opponent's Opinion by the <hi>true Senſe</hi> of the Spirit, and at the ſame Time deny, that either himſelf, or Man, <hi>can have any real Senſe</hi> of the Spirit? I have not here ſuppoſed a Nonentity, but a Caſe that has ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted for a great many Centuries, and which muſt always continue, whilſt Men prefer their own Prejudices, Imaginations, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings, to the internal Leadings of the Spirit of Truth.</p>
               <p n="8">8. We hold the Scriptures to be <hi>a Rule</hi> to all that have them, ſo far as they have a right Underſtanding of them, and alſo that they are adequate to the Purpoſe intended by them; but we cannot aver, they are <hi>the ſole, the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary,</hi> and <hi>the univerſal Director</hi> of Mankind in Matters of religious Duty. 1. They are not the <hi>ſole Director;</hi> becauſe the Spirit of God in the Heart and Conſcience of Man is alſo an
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:021391_0142_0FB36A60353A4438"/>undeniable Director. 2. They are not the <hi>primary Director;</hi> becauſe the Illumination of the Holy Spirit that gave them forth, is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to open the true Senſe of thoſe numerous Parts of them, about which the Apprehenſions of Men ſo much differ. The Spirit alſo from which the Scriptures came, is <hi>original,</hi> and therefore <hi>primary</hi> to them; and as the Spirit only can open its own true Senſe included in them, they are <hi>ſecondary</hi> to the Spirit, as an Inſtrument in its Hand. 3. They are not <hi>the univerſal Director;</hi> becauſe it is not probable that One in Ten, if one in Twenty, of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, have ever had the Opportunity of poſſeſſing them. Seeing therefore this is the Caſe, they cannot properly be pronounced, the <hi>complete, adequate, univerſal Rule of Mankind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence we eſteem them the <hi>ſecondary</hi> Rule or Guide of Chriſtians, which being Divinely communicated for the Uſe of all to whom they may come; and alſo being intrinſically ſuperior in Excellence to all other Writings, we prefer them above all others, and as thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accept, and as comfortably uſe them, as any People upon Earth; verily believing, with the Holy Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Rom. xv. 4</note> that they <q>were written for our Learning, that we, through Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Comfort of the Sciptures might have Hope.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is not to depreciate the Scriptures, but to hold them in their proper Place, and due Superiority to the Works of Men, and Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to their Supreme Communicator, and only ſure Expounder. For the Holy Spirit is requiſite to the right Uſe of them, as the Agent to the Inſtrument; and what is an
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:021391_0143_0FB36A616D8AE3C8"/>Inſtrument without a Hand to guide and enforce it? And which is ſuperior, the Agent or the Inſtrument? The Holy Spirit is the <hi>original Wiſdom</hi> whence the Scriptures came, and the ſole Power that can open, and give right Effects to them.<note place="margin">John xv. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>The Spirit of Truth is given to guide into all Truth;</hi> is the only Thing that can do it, and conſequently <hi>the Supreme Guide</hi> afforded to Mankind. It is both unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable and irrational, to aſſert any Thing elſe is the <hi>ſole,</hi> or <hi>primary Director,</hi> whilſt the Spirit of God is communicated for that Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The ſame Scripture-Truths appear as diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently to each Perſon, as their Underſtandings differ one from another. Human Intellects therefore muſt be rectified, to enable them to ſee thoſe Truths in the ſame Senſe. The Rectifier is the Spirit of Truth, which alone can unite them in the true Senſe.</p>
               <p>We ſtick not to ſtyle the Scriptures collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, <hi>a Divine,</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian Rule;</hi> but we object to call them, <hi>The Rule of Faith and Practice,</hi> leſt that ſhould be underſtood to imply we are to look for nothing further to be our Guide or Leader. The Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves abundantly teſtify, there is ſomething ſuperior to them, which all ought to look for, and attend unto; that is, the Holy Spirit of the Supreme Legiſlator of Men, and Prime Author of the ſacred Writings; in and by whoſe Light and Power they are made inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally uſeful, and adequate to the Purpoſes intended by them. Like a good Sun-dial, they are true and perfect in their Kind, that is, as Writings; but, reſpecting the Parts differently
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:021391_0144_0FB36A68B21676C8"/>underſtood, they may juſtly bear the ſame Motto with the Dial, * <hi>Non ſine Lumine.</hi> For as the Dial without the Caſt of the Sun-beams, has not its proper Uſe, to tell the Time of the Day; neither doth the ambiguous Text anſwer its true End, infallibly to communicate the Mind of the Holy Spirit to different Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, except the luminous Beams of the Sun of Righteouſneſs diſcover it to the attentive Mind.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Our Oppoſers call the Scriptures <hi>the primary Rule.</hi> We allow it is <hi>the prmiary written Rule,</hi> and in all Diſputes betwixt them and us, we abide by its Deciſion, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our underſtanding of the Senſe of it, which they profeſs to do likewiſe by theirs. In all public Differences therefore we refer intentionally to the ſame Rule with them. But we have both plain Scripture and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience to ſupport our Belief, that reſpecting the particular Duty of Individuals, every one hath in his own Breaſt, a nearer and more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rule or Guide of Conſcience than the Scriptures; <hi>the Manifeſtation of the Spirit given to every Man to profit withal,</hi> which duly obſerved, gives a right Interpretation of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo far as is neceſſary for them, and alſo the trueſt Senſe of each particular Perſon's Duty to him. When a Perſon feels the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Witneſs of God in his Conſcience, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning him for what is wrong, and approving him for what is right, does he not find it to ſpeak more clearly, particularly, and convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to his Caſe and State, than he can read it in the Scriptures? Can he then conclude,
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:021391_0145_0FB36A6A7543AE60"/>that this truly-diſtinguiſhing and moſt ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Witneſs, is leſs than that <hi>Spirit of Truth,</hi> or <hi>Comforter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John xvi. 8.</note> which <hi>convinceth the World of Sin, of Righteouſneſs, and of Judgment?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Speaking of Perſons unenlightened, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that <q>every Man's Senſe of Scripture, is his Scripture, and when he propoſes his Opponent ſhall be determined by Scripture, he means according to his own Apprehenſion of the Senſe of it.</q> This <hi>S. N.</hi> applies equally to Mens Apprehenſions of the Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of the Spirit within them; and I allow, it holds equally againſt thoſe Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to the Spirit's Illuminations, who are in Reality void of them; but it will by no Means conclude againſt the really Enlightened; nor will his following Argument prove that no Man is enlightened. "For," ſaith he, P. 10. <q>what <hi>John Reeve</hi> and <hi>Lodowick Mugleton</hi> thought to be the Mind of the Spirit within them, <hi>William Penn</hi> and his Brethren de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied; and what theſe thought to be the Mind of the Holy Ghoſt, the former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected as ſpurious.</q> This ſhews, that the Pretenſions of <hi>both</hi> Parties could not be right, but not that <hi>neither</hi> of them were ſo, any more than it would prove the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi>

               <p>When Chriſt, after his Reſurrection,<note place="margin">Luke xxiv. 45.</note> 
                  <hi>opened the Underſtandings of his Diſciples that they might underſtand the Scriptures,</hi> was not the Divine Illumination in their Underſtandings, a more clear, certain and ſuperior Evidence of the Senſe of them, than all their Reading and Study could have afforded them, without ſuch
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:021391_0146_0FB36A6BDE2A4270"/>Illumination? Are Mankind now become ſo much more wiſe and penetrating, than thoſe who for Years had the Benefit of hearing him who is perfect in Wiſdom, that they have no Need of his Aſſiſtance to open their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings? Or is their School and College Learning ſo perfect, as to render God's Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination quire needleſs? Are the innumerable Claſhings and Janglings of the Book-learned about the Senſe of Scripture, a Proof of the Unity of their Sentiments, and the Verity of their Senſe of diſputed Texts? If ſo, Diſcord may be a Proof of Harmony, and Fighting of Agreement.</p>
               <p>From what is paſt, I truſt, it will appear that our Oppoſer's <hi>more certain Criterion,</hi> P. 3. is only ſuch in his own Imagination. How can that be the <hi>certain Criterion,</hi> about the Meaning of which all the Uncertainty ariſes? It is certain, without Divine Illumination, every Reader of Texts of a dubious Senſe, accepts them in the Senſe his Prepoſſeſſions make for him; which is the Cauſe of the innumerable Differences amongſt profeſſing Chriſtians. <hi>R.

               </p>
               <p>Ibid. <q>It is not conceived, however, that they can find out his <hi>Eſſence.</hi>
                  </q> Anſw. They do not preſume to find out his <hi>Eſſence.</hi> They are content with, and thankful for, the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations he is pleaſed to make of his <hi>Influence;</hi> which this Author, P. 8. injudiciouſly jum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles together with Views, Sentiments, Effects, Production, Creature, &amp;c. Whereas the <hi>Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
                  <pb n="146" facs="unknown:021391_0148_0FB36A7383CC9860"/>ſhed by the <hi>Eſſence</hi> is not of its Creation, but an Emanation of its own Nature, Power and Quality, which produceth thoſe Effects in the Creature, as the Potential Influence of the Sun, is of the Nature and Quality of the Sun, producing its ſalutary Effects in external Nature, and ſenſibly operating upon ſenſitive Creatures, ſo as to enable them to ſee by its Light, and to feel the comforting Warmth of its Preſence, as well as truly to diſcover its Productions in and around them.</p>
               <p>Having indiſcriminately confounded Things that differ, <hi>S. N.</hi> proceeds thus to ſyllogize upon it.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>That which is not known, felt or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in its real Nature, cannot be a Rule of Action to any One, ſuperior to its own Influence, Effects or Productions.</p>
                  <p>The Holy Spirit is not known, felt or diſcerned in his real Nature, by any <hi>Quaker</hi> or others, but <hi>only his Influence,</hi> Effects, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Therefore he cannot be in his own real Nature a Rule of Action to them, ſuperior to his own Productions, Effects and Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               </q>
               <p>This demonſtrates how void of Truth and Probability Logic may be in a ſophiſtical Hand. For, How ſhould any Thing be a Rule ſuperior to its Influence, when its Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is that by which it rules? And with what Propriety is its Influence, and the Effects and Productions of that Influence placed under the ſame Predicament? This Argument evidently inſinuates, 1. That the Influence of the Holy Spirit is no more of its real Nature, than the Works and Effects produced by it; which is
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:021391_0149_0FB36A74E98424B0"/>the ſame Thing as to ſay, The Influence of the Sun in the Firmament, that is, <hi>his Beams,</hi> which irradiate his diſtinguiſhing Light, and ſhed his animating Warmth, are no more of his real Nature, than the Wax he ſoftens, or the Clay he hardens. 2. That the rational Soul feels and diſcerns the Influence of the Spirit, without any real Senſe of the Nature of the Spirit. This appears to me juſt as true, as that we ſee by the Light of the Sun, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Perception of that Light, and are corporeally animated by its Warmth, without ever feeling it. 3. That if the eſſential Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Divine Being do not come into immediate Contact with the Soul of Man, he cannot have any ſenſible Perception of God's Nature by his Divine Influence; which is like aſſerting, that the powerful Influence of the Sun cannot be ſenſibly perceived by a Man, unleſs the Body of the Sun immediately touch his Body.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Having noted in my Obſervation, P. 14, 15, from <hi>John</hi> v. 39, that the Phariſees reſted upon the Scriptures, and would not apply to Chriſt, my Opponent anſwers, P. 11. <q>Our Saviour, however, ſeems to give a different Account of the Matter; for he frequently tells them, <hi>Mat.</hi> xv. 6. <hi>Mark</hi> vii. 13. that they made the Word of God of none Effect, through their Traditions; how then could they be ſaid to reſt upon it?</q> Anſw. The Reaſon our Saviour gives, why they ſhould, or did ſearch the Scriptures, is, For, in them "ye think ye have eternal Life." If <hi>they thought</hi> to have eternal Life in the Scriptures, they certainly, in that Senſe, <hi>reſted upon them</hi>
                  <pb n="148" facs="unknown:021391_0150_0FB36A7662954968"/>for it, and not upon Chriſt, the only Saviour, to whom they would not come that they might have it. As to their making the Word, or Command of God, of none Effect through their Traditions, that was ſpoken at a different Time, and appears not to relate to the Object of their Dependence for eternal Life, therefore cannot either with Propriety or Prudence, be urged in Contradiction to what he here aſſerted. The Text, I apprehend, may be thus under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. <hi>Search,</hi> or rather, <hi>ye ſearch the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for in them ye think ye have eternal Life.</hi> You think ſo, but are miſtaken, for they are not the Life, but come from the Life, <hi>and they are they which teſtify of me,</hi> who am the Life; yet ye ſtick in them as your Life, <hi>and ye will not come to me,</hi> the Life, <hi>that ye might have Life;</hi> therefore, notwithſtanding your Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon the Scriptures, ye remain in a State of Death, reſting upon the Letter only, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Knowledge of the Spirit.</p>

               <p>What true Goſpel-Faith is, let us a little conſider.

                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. iv. 13.</note> which is not a bare Belief of Truths concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt,<note place="margin">2.

Goſpel-Faith in Man believes the Truth of all that is revealed by the Spirit, both in the Heart, and in the Sacred Writings; becauſe it feels it, ſavours it, and is one with it. It not only <hi>aſſents to</hi> the ſcriptural Accounts of the Incarnation and whole Proceſs of Chriſt in <hi>Judea;</hi> but it alſo <hi>receives</hi> his internal Appearance, <hi>conſents to</hi> his Operation, and <hi>concurs</hi> with it.</p>

                  <pb n="155" facs="unknown:021391_0157_0FB36A8C1F8A14D8"/>
That Faith which ſtands wholly upon Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay, Tradition, Reading, or Imagination, is but a diſtant Kind of ineffectual Credence, which permits the Soul to remain in the Bondage of Corruption. The Wicked may go this Length towards Goſpel-Faith; but the true Faith lays hold of, and cleaves to the Spirit of Truth, in its inward Manifeſtations, wherein it ſtands, and whereby it grows, till the Heart is purified, the World overcome, and Salvation obtained.</p>
               <p>This Faith is as a Flame of pure Love in the Heart to God. It preſſeth towards him, panteth after him, reſigns to him, confides and lives in him.<note place="margin">1 Tim. iii. 9.</note> The <hi>Myſtery of it is held in a pure Conſcience,</hi> and in the effective Power of the Everlaſting Goſpel; whence <hi>the Chriſtian Diſpenſation</hi> in Holy Writ, is often diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the exterior Diſpenſation of the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Law, and the prior Adminiſtration of Angels in viſible Appearances, by the Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of FAITH.</p>
               <p>Though the Term Faith is occaſionally uſed by the Pen-men of Scripture in divers, yet not contrary, but conſiſtent Senſes, this ſeems to be the <hi>One</hi> ſtanding Faith mentioned, <hi>Eph.</hi> iv. 5. which <hi>is in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> as it is the Fruit of his Grace and good Spirit in the Heart.

What <hi>Barclay,</hi> therefore, urges in this Caſe, is the reciprocal Teſtimony of the Spirit with the Scriptures, as the cleareſt and beſt Convincement of both to the Mind of Man, and this not ſo much by Way of Argument to the Head, as Appeal to the Conſcience.</p>

               </p>
               <p>If <hi>G. Fox</hi> had from a Divine Impulſe, found it his Concern <hi>to go naked</hi> for three Years together, as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> did;<note place="margin">Iſai. xx.</note> or <hi>to lay Siege to a Tile,</hi> in a cumbent Poſture,<note place="margin">Ezek. iv.</note> and bake his Bread with Dung, for the Space of fifteen Months, as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> did; it would as ſurely have drawn down the Reſentment of <hi>S. N.</hi> upon him, and would have been altogether as juſt a Foundation for his Aſperity.</p>
               <p>With Reſpect to miraculous Teſtimonials; when I conſider the many groſs Impoſitions of that Kind, under Names delivered down to us with great Veneration, and ſainted in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, I do not admire that thinking Perſons, not ſufficiently experienced in the Divine Life, ſhould be inclined to diſbelieve any modern Narratives of ſupernatural Tokens. But this Difference is evidently obſervable, between the ſew related by <hi>George Fox,</hi> and his Friends, and the many by <hi>Popiſh</hi> Writers. Theſe induſtriouſly propagated their miraculous Legends for a Name; for the Support of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural Superſtition, and ſeparate Intereſts, monaſtic Inſtitutions, the Adoration of Relicks, and of the bleſſed Virgin, the Invocation of Saints, real or nominal, Prayers for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, Image-worſhip, their deified Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the formal Sign of the Croſs, conſecrated
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:021391_0164_0FB36A9F37305B60"/>Oil, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> But <hi>G. Fox</hi> never once pretended to a Power of working Miracles to the People where he came, to open a Door amongſt them for the Reception of himſelf, or the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples he ſpread; nor was it neceſſary he ſhould, ſince they had been already miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly atteſted, in the firſt planting of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. For, the Fundamentals he preached were, Chriſt once in the Fleſh, and always in Spirit, as the Light and Life of Men, the Mediator, the Propitiation, the Interceſſor, the potential and actual Redeemer, offered for all, and to all, and the eſpecial Saviour of all that believe in him ſo as to obey him; with the Neceſſity of Regeneration in Man, and the Practice of every Moral and Chriſtian Virtue.</p>
               <p>Is it nothing extraordinary, that a Perſon ſo obſcure and illiterate, ſo little converſant amongſt Men, ſo uneducated in Arts, Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages and Sciences, ſo unverſed in the various Modes of Divinity, by Turns in Faſhion, uninſtructed, unprovided, unprotected by Men, ſhould ſingly and alone, launch into the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Sea of a tempeſtuous fluctuating World, and in direct Oppoſition to all the Pride, Policy and Power of a learned and lucrative Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and a prejudiced People with a bigotted Magiſtracy at their Head; that ſuch an One, by the ſimple Doctrine of the Croſs of Chriſt, ſhould be made inſtrumental to the turning of Thouſands, not from Form to Form, but from Darkneſs to Light; from the Power of Satan, to the Power of God; from a Death in Sin, to the Life of Righteouſneſs; from habitual Vice, to a Courſe of Virtue; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that ſome judicious Magiſtrates declared,
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:021391_0165_0FB36AA22E0A1648"/>the People raiſed through his Miniſtry, eaſed their Hands of much Trouble, and had it not been for the Spreading of this Principle of Divine Light, the Nation would have been over-run with Ranteriſm, and Licentiouſneſs! In this great and good Work, <hi>G. Fox,</hi> with the People he had been inſtrumental to raiſe, ſtood with unabated Courage and Conſtancy, and were enabled, with undaunted Fortitude, to bear up againſt near forty Years cruel Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, with ſmall Intervals, both from royal and republican Parties, as each aſcended the Scale of national Power. This he was favoured to ſee an End of, before his Removal beyond the Noiſe of Archers, and out of the Reach of Envy and Malignity.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the inviduous Miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations made concerning him, no Marks of Inſincerity, Artifice or Impoſture appeared in his Conduct, nor of Intereſt or Ambition in his Views. He ſought not to gather People to himſelf, but <hi>to Chriſt alone.</hi> He made no Pretences to work Miracles, in Confirmation of his Miſſion, whilſt he travelled and laboured amongſt his Fellow-creatures; but, in his Journal, which he left behind him in Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript, he acknowledges the Goodneſs and Power of God, in giving extraordinary Proofs at Times, according to his Pleaſure, that he attended ſome of them, with a Meaſure of the ſame Divine Power, which formerly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied divers of the primitive Miniſters in a much larger degree.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding the Principles we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, are evidently ſcriptural,<note place="margin">Page 29.</note> and <hi>depend not upon,</hi> nor as <hi>S. N.</hi> miſtakenly aſſerts, <hi>ſtand or
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:021391_0166_0FB36AA375958B68"/>fall together</hi> with any Relations of miraculous Appearances, either in <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s Journal, or the Writings of his Co-temporaries; which Relations are <hi>purely incidental,</hi> and appeared not till many Years after the Settlement of the Society. Yet, as he was an uſeful, eminent, and honourable Member of our religious Body, we are not unconcerned in his Veracity, and therefore require better Proofs againſt it than the Surmiſes, Preſumptions, and Diſguiſes of Prejudice. What he relates of the Facts, he aſſerts upon his own Knowledge of them, and divers are witneſſed to by others as well as himſelf. Can <hi>S. Newton</hi> aſſert the Contrary, upon his certain Knowledge of the Falſhood of thoſe Relations; or has he demonſtrated the Truth of them to be impoſſible? No ſuch Matter. They are ſuch as have always been; and what have been may be. <hi>George Fox</hi>'s Integrity is too well atteſted, to be deſtroyed by Imaginations, Innuendoes, and Invectives. Lucre, Preferment, the Avoidance of Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, Diſtreſs, or Abuſe, have operated upon the Hopes and Fears of many; but never appeared to have ſhaken, or weighed with him. Such was the Strength of his Faith, and the internal Support which attended him. He was no Sect-maſter. He ſought neither exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Benefits, nor the Honour that is from below. He traded not in Religion. He truckled not to the corrupt Humours or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of any. He called the People out of that Apoſtacy from the Holy Spirit of God they were too generally ſunk into, and out of thoſe carnal Ordinances which could not truly profit them, nor contribute to Renovation of
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:021391_0167_0FB36AA5AD539F58"/>Heart, and Reformation in Life and Practice. Neither did himſelf, nor thoſe who became connected with him, divide from others for Separation-ſake, but to join together in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>the One Everlaſting Shepherd</hi> of the true Sheep. To <hi>him</hi> they gathered, and in the Life and Love of the Goſpel, became united to him in Spirit, as <hi>their only Head,</hi> and one to another as Brethren. They learnt to call no Man <hi>Maſter</hi> in a religious Senſe, and to know that the true Church is not the Church of <hi>Peter,</hi> of <hi>Paul,</hi> or of <hi>Apollos;</hi> that it owns but one Head, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; whoſe Followers they profeſſed to be, and not the Followers of <hi>G. Fox, R. Barclay, W. Penn,</hi> or any other, further than they followed him. Theſe they never looked upon as Heads of, but Brethren in the Society, never ſtiled themſelves by their Names, nor allowed them any other Eſtimation, than that <hi>double Honour</hi> required by the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">1 Tim. v. 17.</note> to thoſe who are doubly ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable.</p>
               <p>It is too probable from the Sacred Writings to be denied, that the Almighty, both before the Inſtitution of the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Law, and during its Continuance, all along, at Seaſons, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally manifeſted apparent Tokens of his ſupernatural Power, through thoſe he parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly concerned to hold up the Mirror of true Religion in its genuine Purity, and to revive and reſtore it when loſt, or to a great Degree obſcured amongſt its Profeſſors; and why ſhould it appear an Abſurdity to ſuppoſe, that ſince the primitive Age of Chriſtianity, he ſhould ſee fit ſometimes on like Occaſions, to add Sanctions of like Nature? When I find
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:021391_0168_0FB36AA72B1A4958"/>ſuch Inſtances teſtified to by Men of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, Integrity, and diſintereſted Chriſtian Piety, upon their own Knowledge of the Facts, I ſee no juſt Ground to diſcredit their Atteſtations, becauſe Perſons manifeſtly preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced againſt them, and confeſſedly inſenſible of the Influence and Operation of the Holy Spirit, have ſettled themſelves in an Opinion, that they are to remain for ever to be diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued under the Adminiſtration of the Goſpel, though continued occaſionally throughout all former Diſpenſations. I have met with no Reaſon ſufficient to warrant me to conclude, that the great Miniſter of the Sanctuary might not ſee proper, in the laſt Century, to add ſome Inſtances of this Kind, to the Services of his diſintereſted and devoted Servants, for their Encouragement, to ſtem the Torrent of Oppoſition againſt the Revival of his Truth in its Purity, when Formality and Hypocriſy on one Hand, Licentiouſneſs and Prophaneneſs on the other, with Jarring and Violence on all Sides raged againſt them; as if nothing leſs was meant than their utter Extinction.</p>

                     <hi>1. S. N.</hi>'s Inſinuation, that I prefer the Apology to the New Teſtament, with the Imaginations be grounds it upon, anſwered.

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. S. N. in his Letter, Page 9, indirectly inſinuated, that the <hi>Quakers read more, and form their Sentiments more</hi> from the Apology than the New Teſtament. Knowing this to be untrue, I denied it of the Generality of that People, and queried with him, <q>If he intended it of particular Perſons, who are they?</q> In Anſwer to this Queſtion, P. 47, he now aſſumes the Charge of <hi>Nathan</hi> upon <hi>David,</hi> and roundly aſſerts to me, <q>thou art the Man.</q> But how I ſhould be the Man he meant when he penned that Suggeſtion, is myſterious to me, ſeeing <hi>then</hi> he certainly was
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:021391_0170_0FB36AADBB861D08"/>perfectly unacquainted with me. But it ſeems, for Want of another, I muſt be the Man, becauſe <hi>he can't help thinking,</hi> P. 46, that I aſſert or inſinuate, 1. <q>What <hi>the Apoſtles</hi> have ſpoken and written is not the Goſpel." 2. That <hi>the real Meaning</hi> of their Writings is <hi>only a dry Theory.</hi>" 3. That the Goſpel in Fact is <hi>an inexplicable Subſtane</hi> within all Men, whether they know any Thing of the Character and Redemption of Chriſt, as repreſented in the New Teſtament, or not." 4. That <hi>the Whole</hi> of our Salvation <hi>depends ſolely</hi> upon an inward Power and Virtue, without <hi>the Influence of the inſpired Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of the Book of God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>If I may be allowed to ſpeak my own Senſe, what I have aſſerted, and do believe, reſpecting theſe Points, is, 1. That the evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelic and apoſtolic Writings are <hi>deſcriptive and declarative</hi> of the Goſpel,<note place="margin">Rom. i. 16.</note> which <hi>therein</hi> is defined to be <hi>the Power of God unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. i. 24.</note> that <hi>Chriſt is the Power of God,</hi> who ſpiritually and internally adminiſters Light and Life to the Souls of Men, which <hi>ſpiritual and powerful Adminiſtration,</hi> is the <hi>eſſential Goſpel;</hi> and that, both thoſe Parts of Scripture, which bear Teſtimony to the Incarnation and outward Proceſs of Chriſt, and thoſe that witneſs to his inward Miniſtration in Spirit, whether narrative or doctrinal, being the beſt and moſt eminent <hi>written Teſtifications</hi> of the Goſpel, are therefore, by a Metonymy, uſually called by its Name.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In my Obſervations, from P. 36 to 43, I fully made appear, that <hi>the real Meaning</hi> of the apoſtolic Writings is <hi>not a dry Theory,</hi> but
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:021391_0171_0FB36AB021C14028"/>a ſtrong Recommendation of the living and ſenſible Operation of the Power of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Reader may ſee in my Anſwers to the firſt of theſe Articles, and other Parts of this Treatiſe, that <hi>I do not hold the Goſpel to be in Fact an inexplicable Subſtance,</hi> &amp;c. But that it is not to be truly and certainly known without Divine Illumination; for,<note place="margin">1 Cor. ii. 11.</note> 
                  <q>The Things of God knoweth no Man, but the Spirit of God.</q> We read,<note place="margin">2 Tim. i. 10.</note> that <q>Life and Immortality are brought to Light by the Goſpel.</q> But what is this Life and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality? Did not Mankind believe in a future State, before the Incarnation of Chriſt? Yes, certainly: Both Jews and Gentiles believed and held the Truth of it. What Life and Immortality then is that which is <hi>peculiar to the Goſpel,</hi> and which it is <hi>its particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty to unvail?</hi> It conſiſts not wholly in the Relation of the external Procedure and Doctrines of our Lord, but mainly in that ſpiritual Gift he procured for us through his Sufferings, which is <hi>the Life and Power</hi> that the immortal Spirit of God manifeſts in the believing and obedient Soul, that Spirit which quickens thoſe who have been dead in Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes and Sins,<note place="margin">Epheſ. iv. 18.</note> and <hi>therein alienated from the Life of God.</hi> The very, Eſſence of the Goſpel, is the iſſuing forth of this Spirit of Life to the Hearts of Men.<note place="margin">Prov. iv. 23.</note> 
                  <q>Keep thy Heart with all Diligence,</q> ſaith the wiſe Man, <q>for out of it are <hi>the Iſſues of Life.</hi>
                  </q> This teacheth that <hi>theſe living Iſſues</hi> ariſe <hi>in</hi> the Heart of Man, but not <hi>from</hi> the Heart itſelf. Was it ſo, the Heart or Soul would be its own Quickener and Saviour, and Chriſt would be excluded as
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:021391_0172_0FB36AB1E8C3EDA8"/>ſuch;<note place="margin">John xiv. 6.</note> but <hi>he</hi> alone <hi>is the Way, the Truth, and the Life,</hi> therefore the Iſſuings of Life to the Heart are from the Spirit, and in and through it by his Spirit. The Divine Influence of it is the Life of the Soul, that which renders it living, and void of this, it cannot be in a Goſpel Senſe, <hi>a living Soul.</hi> It may endure to Eternity; but mere Duration is not this Divine Life. To exiſt without this Life, is to be ſcripturally dead; it is therefore requiſite for the Soul to wait for, feel after, and find this immortal Life, and alſo to keep to it <hi>with all Diligence,</hi> that it may experience the daily <hi>Iſſues</hi> thereof to its Comfort and Preſervation, and to be as <q>a Well of Water ſpringing up into everlaſting Life.</q>

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The Pretence that I aſſert, the Salvation of thoſe who have the Privilege of peruſing the Scriptures, depends <hi>ſolely</hi> upon an inward Power and Virtue, without thoſe as a Means, is no Aſſertion of mine; for my Words plainly indicate the contrary. I ſay, P. 14, <q>We <hi>do not pretend,</hi> that the internal Motion of the Spirit <hi>is the only Means</hi> of Reformation and Religion, to thoſe who are likewiſe favoured with the Scriptures; but highly prize, thankfully accept, and uſe them as the <hi>beſt ſecondary Means extant.</hi>
                  </q> I alſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the propitiatory Sacrifice of our Saviour, by which he opens the Door of Reconciliation for us, to be the initiatory Part of Man's Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and the internal Work of Regeneration by his Spirit, to be its actual Completion; for thereby an Entrance is adminiſtered into the Heavenly Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="unknown:021391_0173_0FB36AB59987B4A0"/>
Laſtly, no Man can have <hi>the Influence of the inſpired Sentiments</hi> of the Book of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>receiving thoſe inſpired Sentiments,</hi> which I have ſufficiently ſhewn, no Man hath who reads without the inſpiring Power. Every Reader hath only <hi>his own Conceptions</hi> about the Sentiments inſpired of God, and <hi>not thoſe real Sentiments,</hi> without a Degree of Inſpiration from him; which the manifeſt Miſtakes and Contradictions of many demonſtrate they are Strangers to.</p>
               <p>By all this, it muſt evidently appear, that <hi>S. N.</hi>'s Premiſes are ſo many Perverſions, and his <hi>Thou art the Man,</hi> a groundleſs Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>In his two next Paragraphs, <hi>S.

               <list>
                  <item>1. The <hi>Quakers</hi> neither read the Scriptures, nor any Thing elſe, during the Time of their Worſhip, or as a Part of it, but after that is over, they uſually once in the Year, take the Opportunity, before the Congregation ſeparate, to read thoſe ſhort Informations and Advices which are tranſmitted from the Yearly-meeting in <hi>London.</hi> Theſe Advices always conſiſt of Scripture-quotations, and Doctrines agreeable to Scripture, according to the beſt of their Knowledge; but the reading of them is no more a Part of their Worſhip, than the reading Teſtimonies of Denial againſt immoral Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,

                  <item>2. They give ſuch Preference to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures above all other Writings, that they ſtrictly preſs the frequent reading of them, and call for Anſwers at every Quarterly-meeting throughout the Society, and at the general Yearly-meeting in <hi>London</hi> from every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Quarterly-meeting, whether the Holy Scriptures are conſtantly read in their Families, or not; which they neither do, nor ever did, reſpecting any of their own Writings, or any others.</item>
                  <item>3. The Society doth occaſionally preſent, or recommend ſuch of their Books as they think proper to give Information concerning their Principles, to obviate the Prejudices conceived, and induſtriouſly propagated againſt them; which they apprehend, they have as much Right to do, as their Adverſaries have to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſent and calumniate them; and indeed, the Abuſes of thoſe are ſufficient to oblige them to this Practice.</item>
                  <item>4. They do recommend Silence and Still<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in their religious Aſſemblies; and as our Manner of Worſhip is miſunderſtood by many, and often treated with Ridicule, I ſhall take this Opportunity to offer ſome Explanation of it.</item>

               <p>We look upon Divine Worſhip to be the moſt ſolemn Act the Mind of Man is capable of being engaged in; and in Conſideration of the high and inconceivable Majeſty of Almighty God, think it our Duty to approach him with the greateſt Reverence.

                  <q>Without me ye can do nothing.</q> We, therefore, cannot perform Divine Worſhip acceptably but by his Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. This muſt be received in Spirit; for, ſaith the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Rom. viii. 26.</note> 
                  <q>The Spirit alſo helpeth our Infirmities; for <hi>we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought.</hi>
                  </q> This being as certainly our Caſe, as it was that of the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles and primitive Believers, it is incumbent on us to wait for that Spirit which is requiſite to help our Infirmities, in order to pray as we ought. No Forms of Devotion of Mens Invention can ſupply the Place of the Spirit. The ſame Apoſtle further ſaith,<note place="margin">Eph. ii. 18.</note> 
                  <q>Through him we both <hi>have an Acceſs, by one Spirit</hi> unto the Father.</q> Seeing therefore, that both our <hi>Help</hi> and <hi>Acceſs</hi> is through the Spirit of Chriſt, the Renewal of which is at his Pleaſure, and not ours, we muſt neceſſarily wait for it. This Waiting muſt be in <hi>Still<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:021391_0176_0FB36ABAC946B5C8"/>of Mind</hi> from the common Courſe of our own Thoughts, from all wandering Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and alſo in <hi>Silence</hi> from the Expreſſion of Words; for the Utterance of Words is not <hi>waiting,</hi> but acting.</p>
               <p>Words are requiſite to convey the Senſe of one Perſon to another, but not to that Omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Being, who is an univerſal Spirit, and every where Almighty, who therefore ſtands not in Need, either of the Uſe of corporeal Organs, Inſtruments, or the Sound of Words, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with the Spirit of Man.</p>
               <p>If, in order to worſhip, the Mind do not ſettle into Stillneſs, the Paſſions will be at work, and may agitate it into enthuſiaſtic Heats, and vague Imaginations. But in true Stillneſs, and Singleneſs of Soul towards God, they are ſilenced and ſubjected. The ſtill ſmall Voice of the Inſpirer of all Good then comes to be heard, and the Mind being cloſely engaged in Attention thereunto, and anſwering it in Faith and humble Submiſſion, feels Divine Life and Love ſpring up, and receives Ability therein, truly to worſhip the great Author of its Exiſtence, and Heavenly Supplier of its Wants, with a Devotion no Forms can reach.</p>
               <p>This Worſhip is not entered upon by totally laying aſide our Faculties, and falling into a ſenſeleſs Stupor, as ſuperficial Obſervers have imagined, but by a real Introverſion of Mind, and an Attention fixed ſingly upon the alone Object of all Adoration, in patient, yet fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Deſire after him.

               </p>
               <p>Silent Waiting was in Practice among the Prophets, and thoſe that attended them, as appears in the Prophecy of <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> We find the Spirit of the Prophet was engaged in Divine Viſion, whilſt the Elders of <hi>Judah</hi> ſate before him, as it is deſcribed from the 1ſt Verſe of the viiith Chapter, to the 4th of the xith Chapter. During the Time of which Viſion, it cannot be conſiſtently ſuppoſed, that he was either ſpeaking to them, or they to him, or to each other. This was not a ſingular
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:021391_0178_0FB36AC2690E77B0"/>Inſtance of their meeting together, for it was the Manner of God's People to congregate with the Prophets, as that cloſe Reprehenſion plainly indicates.<note place="margin">Eze. xxxiii. 31.</note> 
                  <q>They come unto thee <hi>as the People cometh,</hi> and <hi>they ſit before thee as my People,</hi> and they hear thy Words, but they will not do them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In this ſolemn Practice, we have often been enabled thankfully to acknowledge, the Verity of that gracious Declaration of our Lord, <q>Where Two or Three are gathered together in my Name,<note place="margin">Mat. xviii. 20.</note> there am I in the Midſt of them;" the Fulfilling of that Promiſe. They that wait upon the Lord ſhall renew their Strength;"<note place="margin">Iſa. xl. 31.</note> the Certainty of that Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, The Lord is good unto them that <hi>wait for him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lam. iii. 25.</note> to the Soul that <hi>ſeeketh him;</hi>
                  </q> and the Neceſſity and Authority of that juſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, "Be ſtill,<note place="margin">Pſal. xlvi. 10.</note> and know that I am God."</p>
               <p>As ſilent Waiting appears to us, in the firſt Place, requiſite to the Worſhip of God in Spirit and Truth, it is always our Practice, for we believe he ought to have the Direction of our Hearts therein; and if he pleaſe to influence any One under due Preparation, vocally to appear, either by Way of Addreſs to himſelf in Prayer, or to us in Preaching, we never preclude ſuch Appearances, but ſilently aſſiſt according to our Meaſures. If it prove that none are ſo concerned to ſpeak, we ſit the Time through in Silence, wherein true mental Worſhip is often experienced; but never appoint any Meeting with Intent, that it ſhall be held throughout in Silence, as ſome have miſtakenly imagined; for we believe, that all ought to be led and guided by the good
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:021391_0179_0FB36AC5720724E8"/>Spirit of God, more eſpecially in the ſolemn Acts of Divine Worſhip. It would be an happy Thing, were all ſo led, amongſt us as well as others, but the Caſe appears otherwiſe with too many, who ſit unconcerned, in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of hearing the Miniſtry, inſtead of waiting upon God, and therefore often meet with Diſappointment. The Apoſtle ſaid in his Age, <q>they are not all <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. ix. 6.</note> which are of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  </q> So we muſt acknowledge, all who have deſcended from faithful Anceſtors, are not themſelves faithful; but the Defect is in themſelves, and not in the Principle.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We profeſs, that the Spirit of Truth ought to be ours, and every Man's Leader, and that this Spirit is an infallible Principle, and that ſo far as any faithfully follow it, they are infallibly led, and no further; but we <hi>never did, nor do</hi> profeſs, that all in Society with us <hi>are ſo led,</hi> or even ſufficiently ſeek to be ſo. Nor was it the Caſe amongſt the primitive Chriſtians themſelves. We well know, and freely own, that we have all ſinned, and come ſhort of the Glory of God, and that without Repentance and Regeneration, we muſt for ever fall ſhort of it. We are alſo ſenſible, that upon due Confeſſion, Submiſſion, and ſincere Obedience to the Manifeſtations of Chriſt, the Light of Men,<note place="margin">1 John i. 9.</note> 
                  <q>he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our Sins, and to cleanſe us from all Unrighteouſneſs;</q>
                  <note place="margin">Verſe 7.</note> and if we <q>walk in the Light, as he is in the Light, we have Fellowſhip one with another, and the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth us from all Sin.</q> Could any Thing but either groſs Ignorance, captious Envy, or Malevolence infer from this,
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:021391_0180_0FB36AC6A43E36A8"/>that we profeſs, <hi>we all are,</hi> or that any of us <hi>always are</hi> infallible? Yet ſo have our Doctrines been diſcoloured by our Adverſaries from the Beginning, and in the ſame Track our preſent Oppoſer follows his Predeceſſors, repeatedly upbraiding us by Allegation, that there is ſome Difference both in Sentiment and Practice among us; but is it poſſible to be otherwiſe with any Body of People, whether leſs or more, whilſt different Degrees of Capacity and Experience remain amongſt them, as they ever muſt, and whilſt any are deficient in pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that due Regard to the Principles they profeſs, which they ought to do?</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>S. N</hi>'s ſubſequent Query, Page 47, has Reference to an Expreſſion of mine, in Anſwer to his common, though improper, Manner of Reaſoning, that is, drawing gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Concluſions from particular Premiſes, and charging the Faults of particular Perſons upon the general Body, which never eſpouſed nor countenanced them. This I ſhewed to be a fallacious Practice, and inſtanced, that by this Manner of Arguing, the Theft and Treachery of <hi>Judas</hi> might be charged upon the whole twelve Apoſtles, ſeeing he was one of them. Upon this my Opponent impertinently aſks, <q>Did <hi>our Lord,</hi> and his Apoſtles countenance Theft or Treachery, as the <hi>Quakers</hi> do pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly and privately a Neglect of a <hi>primary</hi> and <hi>principal Attention</hi> to the Scriptures, as the <hi>beſt Standard</hi> of Faith and Practice?</q>

               <p>This appears intended to deceive the unwary Reader into a Notion, that in the preceding Remark. I have drawn a Reflection injurious to the Character of the Apoſtles, and to

               <p n="5">5. Page 64, he cites this Paſſage from my Obſervations, <q>
                     <hi>Barclay</hi>'s Doctrine is, that the Holy Spirit communicates not a natural Faculty, but itſelf to the faithful Soul, and becomes to it a new Principle wherein, or as an Organ whereby, it is capacitated rightly to underſtand religious Truth.</q> My Inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertence in leaving an Expreſſion ſo ſhort of my real Intention, perhaps may have led my Opponent to miſunderſtand my Meaning.

                  </q> By <hi>this</hi> he might have gathered, that I intended not a Communication of its <hi>Eſſence,</hi> but its <hi>Influence;</hi> like as the Sun in the Firmament doth not ſhed its <hi>Body,</hi> but its <hi>Radiance</hi> upon the Earth; by the unvailing Light, and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating Warmth of which, the Faculties of Men receive a clearer and ſtronger Perception, both of that glorious Luminary itſelf, and alſo of what it reveals and diſcovers, than it is poſſible for them to do without its Aſſiſtance, by all other Means whatſoever. As to the

N.</hi> knows it is only a Metaphor, a ſhort Simile in one Word, often uſed in Diſcourſe, not as Argument, but for Illuſtration; and as no Simile runs on all Four, it is not reaſonable to expect it in this. I meant to be underſtood by the Words, <hi>as an Organ,</hi> its operating <hi>to like Purpoſe</hi> as a corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Organ, or a Means of conveying Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence from the Divine Eſſence to the Soul of Man; as an Eye doth from the Object to the Underſtanding. I hope this Explanation will ſufficiently obviate all the Inferences and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections occaſioned by my Inadvertence.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Page 69 and 70, <hi>S. N.</hi> infers, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> Notion of Revelation ſeems to imply, <hi>that it muſt be a Revelation of ſomething not underſtood, or a Communication of ſomething to the Mind, of which the Soul has no Conception; and that it is a manifeſt Contradiction,—no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation at all,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Barclay</hi> diſtinguiſhes Revelation into <hi>objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> and <hi>ſubjective,</hi> and ſometimes he ſpeaks of the one, and ſometimes of the other. In order to ſhew the Propriety of this Diſtinction, let me obſerve, that the Soul of Man hath not only a Faculty of Cogitation, by which it ordinarily thinks, unites, divides, compares, or forms Ideas, but alſo a <hi>latent Power</hi> of internal Senſation, or of perceiving Spiritual Objects by an inward and ſpiritual Senſe, when pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented through a proper Medium; which, till the Beams of Divine Light ſhine upon it, it muſt be as totally unacquainted with, as the Child in its Mother's Womb is with its Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Sight and Hearing. For, though in that Situation, it may be completely formed,
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:021391_0184_0FB36AD2A4C1CA40"/>and poſſeſs every Organ proper to corporeal Senſation, yet it is not empowered <hi>to exerciſe them,</hi> or really <hi>to know</hi> it hath them, till it be brought forth into the Medium neceſſary to the Uſe of them, compoſed of the Light and Air of this World. Then it firſt finds the peculiar Senſe, and Exerciſe of thoſe natural Powers which, before its Birth, it could not have the leaſt Underſtanding or proper Uſe of. In like Manner, the natural Man muſt be delivered out of his natural Darkneſs, into the luminous and quickening Influence of that Divine Word, or Spirit, which is moſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically ſtiled <hi>the true Light and Life of Men.</hi> Thus born of the Spirit, into this proper Medium of Divine Knowledge, the Soul is made acquainted with that ſpiritual Senſe it could neither diſcover, nor believe pertained to it, whilſt in its natural State. This is no <hi>new natural Faculty</hi> added, but its own mental Power newly opened, and brought into its due Place and Uſe.</p>
               <p>Words are inadequate to the Expreſſion of this internal Senſe felt in the Soul under Divine Influence. It cannot be ideally conveyed to the Underſtanding of the Unexperienced; for it is not <hi>an Image,</hi> but <hi>a Senſation,</hi> impoſſible to be conceived but by its own Impreſſion. So true is that of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">1 Cor. ii. 9, 10.</note> 
                  <q>Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, neither have entered into the Heart of Man, the Things which God hath prepared for them that love him; but God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit.</q> It was upon this Conſideration that I ſaid, Divine Light is the Subject of inward Senſation, <q>and is not to be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:021391_0185_0FB36AD41E331FF8"/>from one to another by Reaſoning, or verbal Deſcription.</q> For, ſhould any Perſon give the moſt clear and lively Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion poſſible of the Light of the Sun, to a Man blind from his Birth, it would only be communicating an <hi>ideal Notion</hi> of the Light, but not <hi>the Light itſelf.</hi> It might be called a ſubjective Revelation concerning the Light to him, but not an objective one of the Light itſelf. This no Man can have but by his own immediate Senſation.</p>
               <p>Divine Revelation is a Diſcloſure of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the rational Mind by the Holy Ghoſt, not in the Mind's own Power to diſcover. This the Holy Spirit doth, either by unvailing of itſelf by its Influence in ſome Degree to the Soul, and giving it an internal Senſe of its Preſence; or by favouring it with the Viſion of other Objects, real or repreſentative, through the Communication of Divine Light and Power; or by giving the Soul a clear Senſe of its own State and Condition. All this being <hi>a Diſcovery of Objects,</hi> is called <hi>objective Revelation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Subjective Revelation</hi> is a Diſcloſure of <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> or Things relative, through the Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Holy Spirit; by which the Mind is opened into the Knowledge of the Divine Will concerning Perſons or Things, led into the true Senſe of Scriptures, or into a deeper Underſtanding of Doctrines than it could ever reach without Divine Illumination. Of this Kind was the original Revelation of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to thoſe who penned them.</p>
               <p>All this, both objective and ſubjective, is truly internal immediate Revelation. What
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:021391_0186_0FB36ADA98058940"/>is now modiſhly treated as the only Revelation ſtill exiſting, and to exiſt, is rather the Fruit of Revelation than the Thing itſelf, a ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Record of Things revealed; for they certainly were ſo to thoſe to whom they were immediately diſcloſed; but the different Senſes put upon the many diſputed Parts of them, for many Generations paſt, demonſtrate thoſe Parts are not truly a Revelation to thoſe who miſtake them; nor can they ever become ſuch to them, till they know the Holy Author to be their Interpreter.<note place="margin">1 Pet. i. 20, 21.</note> For, <q>No Prophecy of Scripture is of any <hi>private Interpretation.</hi> For the Prophecy came not in old Time," or rather, at any Time, "by the Will of Man, but Holy Men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>P. 75 and 76, <hi>S. N.</hi> argues, that the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate internal Revelation of the Holy Ghoſt <hi>is not</hi> in all <hi>ſufficient to ſave,</hi> becauſe <hi>Barclay</hi> allows, that ſome who have once had it, may be, and have been damned; to which I anſwer, if all were ſaved, it would be a certain Proof that God is able to ſave all, but are we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore warranted to deny or diſpute <hi>the Ability</hi> of Almighty Power to ſave all, becauſe all are not ſaved? A flowing Spring is certainly <hi>ſufficient</hi> to quench my Thirſt, if I drink <hi>ſufficiently</hi> of it; but if I refuſe, the <hi>Inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency</hi> is not in the Spring, but entirely owing to my Refuſal. But <hi>Balaam</hi> is adduced as an Inſtance <hi>quite in Point;</hi> becauſe he had internal Revelation, yet taught <hi>Balak</hi> to ſeduce the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to ſin. That he ſometimes had inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Revelation, is true, and whilſt he adhered thereunto, it preſerved him from teaching
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:021391_0187_0FB36ADC659B9040"/>Seduction. It was when he departed from it, or ſuffered himſelf to be ſo far overcome with <hi>a Love to the Wages of Unrighteouſneſs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Pet. ii. 15, and Jude 11.</note> that the Holy Spirit departed from him, as an Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minator and Preſerver, that he joined <hi>Balak</hi> in his evil Purpoſes. This has been the Caſe of all Apoſtates, the Grace of God is <hi>all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient,</hi> but they diſobey, divide from, and thereby prevent it from operating <hi>ſufficiently</hi> to their Salvation.</p>

               <p n="3">3. P. 106, he cites me as follows, Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, P. 44, <q>The <hi>Confidence</hi> of a true Chriſtian is not in what he hears, or reads,

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>real Uſe</hi> of the Scriptures is to afford Inſtruction and Comfort, and their <hi>chief Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance</hi> is to recommend to the Spirit of Chriſt from whence they came, that his People may be enabled rightly to <hi>put their Truſt in him.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. P. 109. <hi>S. N.</hi> thus entitles his 7th Article, <q>The religious Opinions and Practices of <hi>Mr. Phipps's Brethren,</hi> whom he has ſelected from among <hi>the Heathens,</hi> recapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulated, that he may ſee what their ſuppoſed Divine Inſpiration taught them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Inſtances I adduced from the <hi>Pagans,</hi> were to ſhew, that it was evident from ſome of their own Expreſſions, they had an internal Senſe of that <hi>Grace of God</hi> which the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>brings Salvation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tit.ii. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>and hath appeared to all Men.</hi> The Citations I made, appear to me Proofs of it. Our Opponent appearing prepoſſeſſed with an Opinion, that eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is confined to the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of the Hiſtory and Doctrines of our Saviour, is neceſſarily led to think, that all who are not providentially furniſhed with this, are intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally left under an Impoſſibility of entering the Kingdom of Heaven; and thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, that the Generality of the <hi>Pagan</hi> World muſt be void of any Share of the ſaving Grace of God; and that we muſt be wrong in ſuppoſing otherwiſe concerning them. Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of theſe Notions, he ſeems to infer, that the ſame Principle which taught them, they had at Times a Manifeſtation of ſomething of a Divine Nature within them, alſo led them into their Polytheiſm, Idolatry, falſe Theology,
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:021391_0192_0FB36AE79D9C2B70"/>and Immoralities. But I apprehend, this is as far from being true of the <hi>Pagans,</hi> as it is of thoſe Patriarchs, <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and Chriſtians, who have defaulted or degenerated. For I can no more believe, that Principle which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times gave <hi>Plato</hi> a Senſe that <q>the Light and Spirit of God raiſeth up the Soul into a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Communion with him,</q> led him alſo to teach a Plurality of Deities, than I believe the Spirit which led <hi>Noah</hi> to preach Righteouſneſs, led him alſo to over-charge and diſguiſe himſelf with Wine; or that the Spirit which at Seaſons inſpired <hi>Aaron,</hi> led him alſo to make a Golden Calf, for the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to worſhip, or at all concurred with him in it. Nor do I think it reaſonable to conclude, that becauſe <hi>Aaron</hi> aſſiſted in an idolatrous Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and offended the Spirit of God in other Reſpects, as alſo <hi>Miriam, David, Solomon,</hi> and many other inſpired Perſons did, that he <hi>never had</hi> a Senſe of Divine Influence.</p>
               <p>But it ſeems, both myſelf, and the People I am religiouſly connected with, are <hi>Brother-Pagans,</hi> becauſe we hold one like Opinion with ſome of the beſt and moſt intelligent Heathens. Is it either juſt or charitable, to ſuppoſe thoſe Heathens held no ſound or ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Truths? If they did hold any ſuch, how can any ſound or ſenſible Mind do otherwiſe, than to acknowledge the ſame Truths? And, if ſuch a One deteſt their Polytheiſm, Idolatry, and Immorality, as truly as <hi>S. N.</hi> himſelf can do, is he juſtly to be ſtigmatized with the reproachful Title of <hi>Brother-Pagan?</hi> What is it that conſtitutes <hi>Paganiſin?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. xii. 7.</note> Is it a Belief, that <q>the Manifeſtation of the Spirit is given

                     <hi>to every Man</hi> to profit withal?" Or,<note place="margin">Acts x. 34.35.</note> to perceive of a Truth, "that God is no Reſpecter of Perſons, but in every Nation, he that feareth him, and worketh Righteouſneſs, is accepted with him?</q> Then both <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> were <hi>Brother-Pagans</hi> too. If we hold the ſame Doctrine with the <hi>Pagans</hi> where their Tenets are agreeable to Truth, is it equit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to be inferred, that we are one with them where they are not? Should I return my Antagoniſt his Compliment, by produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Points, wherein he accords with <hi>Papiſts, Deiſts, Enthuſiaſts, Antinomians,</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> and charge their Errors and Extravagancies upon him, would he not tell me, it is treating him with <hi>haughty Contempt and virulent Invec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> as he doth without any ſuch Reaſon? Let him look to the Beam in his own Eye.</p>
               <p>The Sentences I quoted from a few <hi>Pagan</hi> Writers demonſtrate what I adduced them for; that they were ſenſible of a Divine Principle in their Conſciences, and knew ſomewhat of its Operation. Their abiding ſtill in ſome Part of the Polytheiſm, &amp;c. they had been educated in, and the Cuſtoms they had been taught to hold as ſacred and inviolable, only indicate, they had not come ſo fully under the Guidance of this Principle, as to be led into all Truth by it; but not that they were void of all Senſe of it.</p>
               <p>P. 119, 120, <hi>S.

The Text doth not peremptorily ſay, <hi>they knew not God,</hi> but that <hi>they knew him not by their own Wiſdom;</hi> and the ſame Apoſtle ſaith, <q>They are without Excuſe;<note place="margin">Rom. i. 20, 21, 22.</note> becauſe that <hi>when they knew God,</hi> they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their Imaginations, and <hi>their fooliſh Heart was dearkened.</hi> Profeſſing themſelves Wiſe, they became Fools.</q> This ſhews, <hi>they had ſome Time a Knowledge of him,</hi> but through Inattention and Diſobedience loſt that Knowledge; as is the Caſe with too many profeſſing Chriſtians as well as they. And when the Apoſtle was among the <hi>Athenians,</hi> he acquainted them,<note place="margin">Acts xvii. 27.</note> that <hi>God made all Nations of Men, that they might feel after him and find him;</hi> intimating, for their Encouragement ſo to do, that <hi>he was not far from every one of them.</hi> If they might <hi>feel after and find him,</hi> it muſt be by <hi>the immediate Revelation</hi> of his Spirit to their Spirits; which when <hi>found and felt,</hi> would, as adhered to in Obedience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>a Divine and ſaving Principle in them.</hi> As to that of <hi>Eph.</hi> ii. 12, it does not appear to relate to the Gentile-World of all Ages and Qualities, but to the carnal State of thoſe Gentile Believers the Apoſtle was then writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to, before their Converſion to Chriſtianity, as the preceding Verſe evidences. Reſpecting I <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 21, it is particularly levelled againſt <hi>all</hi> who depend upon their carnal Wiſdom, their natural or acquired Parts, for the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God.

               <p>I deny all ſuch to be either Brethren, or any Thing elſe, <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>ſavingly influenced</hi> by the Spirit of God.

                  <note place="margin">Rom. i. 28.</note> after long Forbearance, <hi>he gives them over to a reprobate Mind.</hi> Our Principle teaches, that <hi>the Grace of God that bringeth Salvation, hath appeared to all Men,</hi> firſt as a Convictor, or Convincer of Sin. Thus it ſtands at the Door of Man's Heart, and knocks for En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, and if the Heart opens to it, and abides <hi>in the Ability it furniſhes,</hi> ſincerely deſiring, and ſeeking to obey its Motions, it will, by due Degrees, increaſe <hi>that Ability</hi> therein, till it prove itſelf <hi>the Power of God unto Salvation</hi> to it. Then, and not till then, the Mind is ſenſible of <hi>the ſaving Knowledge</hi> of this Divine Principle; yet, before this, whilſt the Soul knew nothing more of it than merely its Convictions, it could not be faid to be totally ignorant of an internal immediate Senſe of that Grace which <hi>is ſaving,</hi> both <hi>in

               </p>
               <p>I appeal to that Senſe of the Grace of God, in every conſcientious Breaſt, whether thoſe uncandid Reflections, and the Inſinuation of my Oppoſer, that <hi>I may exult in the religious Spirit of impure immoral Idolators,</hi> be doing Juſtice to the ſcriptural Doctrine I declare, and becoming his Pretenſions as a Miniſter of the Goſpel?</p>

               <p n="7">7. In all theſe Reſpects the Holy Spirit operated in common amongſt the primitive Believers. For the Continuation of the ſame ſpiritual Operations, it is that we plead, and not that of miraculous Gifts; which were always extraordinary, and afforded but to few in Compariſon of the whole Number of the Primitives. Yet our Examiner all along chuſes, that we ſhall mean what he pleaſes, and what may beſt anſwer the End he ſo artificially labours to accompliſh. Upon this Ground, P. 122, &amp;c. he proceeds againſt us, as though we diſputed the Convincement of the Chriſtian Converts through the Preaching of the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles; which we are as far from denying as any People upon Earth. What I oppoſed him in was, the Inference he appeared to make, <hi>that becauſe it pleaſed God to teach them ſometimes inſtrumentally, he never taught them immediately at any Time; or, that none were ever converted or taught of God but through external Means;</hi> which the very Convictions of God's Grace in every Man's Conſcience diſprove.</p>
               <p>He allows, <hi>all Men have the Spirit,</hi> but denies they have any more Senſe of it, than a Vegetable of the Sap that nouriſhes it. But his own repeated Confeſſion, that when he does Right Conſcience approves, and when he does Wrong it condemns him, ſhews the Contrary. This is generally called Conſcience,
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:021391_0200_0FB36AFC05B987C8"/>becauſe it is ſomething of God appearing in the Mind, and giving it a conſcious Senſe of Right and Wrong reſpecting its own Acts. No Man could know it makes theſe juſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions without a Senſe of them. What is inward Conviction for Evil, but a Senſe of Guilt? And, what is the genuine Effect of Guilt, but Remorſe? What does Remorſe lead to, but Repentance? And what is Repentance, but the Doctrine of the Goſpel? Every rational Creature under Heaven, therefore, having this Senſation, hath the Goſpel preached in him or her by this righteous Principle, agreeable to <hi>Col.</hi> i. 3.</p>
               <p>Our Lord ſhewed his Diſciples, that the Spirit of Truth,<note place="margin">John xv. and xvi.</note> the Comforter, ſhould <hi>not only bring to their Remembrance what he had told them, ſhow them Things to come, and lead them into all Truth;</hi> but it ſhould likewiſe, <hi>reprove the World of Sin, of Righteouſneſs, and of Judgment.</hi> Whether this Divine Viſitor appears to the Mind of Man, in Words, or without Words, by the Senſations of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction and Remorſe; whether in the Sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Reproof, or the healing Touches of Conſolation; whether it manifeſts itſelf as Light, or ſheds its Life and Love into the Heart; whether it darts upon it as Lightning, or ſettles it in a Holy Serenity; fills it with Faith, or inflames it with Zeal; in all theſe Ways, ſeeing it proceeds not by Meſſenger, but by its own immediate Communication to the rational Soul of Man, it is properly ſtiled <hi>internal immediate Revelation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Divine Principle is a living Source of Truth and Virtue in Man, without which
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:021391_0201_0FB36AFF53A2D718"/>Laws and Precepts would little avail, and when, through Faithfulneſs thereunto, it is enlarged and advanced over all in the Soul, it is found to be a ſure Foundation, which neither the Wiſdom of the Wiſe, the Reaſonings of the Conſident, the Jugglings of the Crafty, the Deriſion of the Reviler, the Rage of the Perſecutor, nor even the Gates of Hell can prevail againſt.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>S. N.</hi>'s repeated Allegations that this Principle is inexplicable and unintelligible, and calling for particular Definitions of its peculiar Eſſence, with his inſulting Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions thereupon, amount to nothing more than this Argument. <hi>If you are really ſenſible of this Principle, you can clearly deſine what it is; but you are not able thus to define it; therefore you have no Senſe of it.</hi> To ſhew this Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proves nothing, take the following Parallel. <hi>If you are really ſenſible there is a magnetic Power in the Loadſtone, you can clearly define what that Power is; but you are not able clearly to define it; therefore you have no Senſe of it.</hi> What experienced Navigator would prefer this Reaſoning to the Facts he has had occular Demonſtration of; to the certain Experience he has daily profited by? That a Man muſt be able to define to others, the peculiar Eſſence of whatever he ſenſibly knows to be true, is beyond the Power of Logic to prove. It is enough for us to know, that it is God that worketh in us, and to yield Obedience to his Operations; the Truth of which is not at all affected by a Want of nice and eſſential Definitions of that which effects them. We plainly behold the aſtoniſhing natural Virtue
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:021391_0202_0FB36B05C22489C8"/>of the Magnet, both reſpecting its Attraction and polar Adheſion. It is an undeniable effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power, yet eſſentially undefinable by the Wit of Man. All the Attempts that have been, or can be made to diſcover it, whether juſt or erroneous, cannot in the leaſt affect the Reality and Verity of it; becauſe a Cloud of Witneſſes have found it to be true by a ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Evidence. So it is with the Work and Power of the Holy Spirit. All the painful Reſearches of the moſt ingenious and penetrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Mankind, demonſtrate that the intimate Eſſences, and intrinſic Differences of natural Things, are out of the Reach of human Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery; much more ſo are thoſe of a ſpiritual Nature.</p>
               <p n="9">9. In his Note, P. 123, he ſuſpects, I can't conſcientiouſly believe, what I cannot but conſcientiouſly believe; which is, that to be <hi>fervent in Spirit,</hi> relates to the Fervency of a Man's own Spirit;<note place="margin">Acts xviii. 25.</note> and that to be <hi>fervent in the Spirit,</hi> as expreſſed of <hi>Apollos,</hi> intends a Fervency inſpired by the Spirit. It is true, our Tranſlators have rendered the like Phraſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> xii. 11. <hi>fervent in Spirit;</hi> but probably, what led them to that might be the contraſting Expreſſion preceding it, <hi>not ſlothful in Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> yet I think unwarrantably.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>S. N.</hi> ſaith, <q>Mr. <hi>Phipps</hi> alſo is for making a Syllogiſm for me, that he might the more eaſily refute it.</q> The Syllogiſm I made for him is founded upon his own Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; that <q>God had many People at <hi>Corinth,</hi> but he did not chuſe to teach them the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel by immediate Revelation. No,</q> &amp;c. His new ſubſtituted Syllogiſm is founded
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:021391_0203_0FB36B074D9A6048"/>upon a different Poſition, to which I do not object; that is, <q>they were not taught the Goſpel by internal immediate Revelation <hi>alone.</hi>
                  </q> By his Addition of the Word <hi>alone,</hi> he alters from his former Doctrine to ours. What the Apologiſt aſſerts, is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently proved; for I have ſhewn, Words, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Divine Influence, are not to be depended on for the true Senſe of ambiguous Expreſſions, becauſe they are ſo liable to be differently underſtood by different Perſons.</p>
               <p n="10">10. What <hi>S. N.</hi> gives out as our Terms of Admiſſion, P. 128, are not our Terms of Admiſſion. We receive our Members upon a better Foundation than he appears to be acquainted with. Our Terms of Admiſſion, are, a free and unforced conſcientious Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcence upon Principle, with the eſſential Doctrines of Truth and real Chriſtianity, and the Rules of the Society founded thereon, and not upon mere external Appearances. The Divine Principle itſelf is our Bond of Union, and the Holy Scriptures are our Articles. Chriſt once in the Fleſh, and always in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, are Fundamentals with us. We require no Subſcription to Articles of human Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>As to Differences in Opinion amongſt us; whilſt Profeſſors of the ſame Faith differ in Years and Experience, in Capacity and Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, in Education and Aſſociates, in Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs or Unfaithfulneſs to their Principles, there muſt be different Opinions and Practices. When the Believers in the primitive Age of Chriſtianity grew numerous, it was the Caſe amongſt them, and in all Societies ever ſince.
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:021391_0204_0FB36B08ABF34C08"/>What we aſſert is, that the One Holy Spirit leads all that faithfully follow it into Same<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Doctrine, and Unity of Love; and that all who profeſs to be Followers of Chriſt, <hi>ought</hi> to be led by his Spirit; but that <hi>all,</hi> either of our own Society, or any other, <hi>are ſo led,</hi> we are far from aſſerting or believing.</p>
               <p>The Quotatation made from <hi>Barclay,</hi> Page 131, amounts to no more than this; <hi>that the Spirit of God is ſufficient of itſelf, without any Thing elſe; but nothing elſe is ſufficient without that.</hi> To infer from this undeniable Truth, that we mean every Thing but the Holy Spirit <hi>is uſeleſs</hi> to Man's Salvation, whether the Spirit pleaſe to uſe them or not, is a mere Perverſion. Whatever the Spirit is pleaſed to uſe, it ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders uſeful; what it uſes not in the Work of Salvation, cannot be uſeful towards it; for <hi>Salvation is of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſ. xxxvii. 39.</note> and <hi>there is no Saviour beſides him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. lxiii. 11.</note> To parallel this with ſuch an Huddle of Falſhoods, as my Oppoſer cites from the deiſtical Author of <hi>Chriſtianity not founded on Argument,</hi> is only a Repetition of one of his cuſtomary Abuſes.</p>
               <p n="11">11. P. 135. He thinks <q>
                     <hi>Barclay</hi>'s Time or Day of Viſitation, which does not always continue through a Man's Life,</q> a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and melancholy Opinion. "For," ſays he, <q>were a Man properly affected with his miſerable Condition by Sin, and once ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined his Day of Grace to be over, neither the Light within him, nor the Goſpel with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, can give him any Relief.</q> For this Reaſon Men ought carefully to embrace the Day of their Viſitation, and follow the Advice of our Saviour,<note place="margin">John xii. 36.</note> who ſaith, <q>While
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:021391_0205_0FB36B0BA046BDB8"/>ye have the Light, believe in the Light, that ye may be the Children of Light.</q> This is the only Way to eſcape the dreadful Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of continuing in Rebellion againſt it. And, is it not a Comfort to all Men, that they are allowed this Opportunity? If he think ſo unfavourably of this Doctrine, what does he teach others to think of his favourite Doctrine of <hi>Preterition,</hi> which allows of <hi>no Condition,</hi> or <hi>Time of Viſitation-at all,</hi> nor even <hi>one ſingle Chance</hi> for Salvation, to the Majority of Mankind?</p>
               <p>That there is ſuch a Time and Opportunity as <hi>Barclay</hi> inculcates, and that it may be loſt to Apoſtatizers paſt Redemption, is evident from that awful Paſſage, <hi>Heb.</hi> vi. 4, 5, 6. <q>It is impoſſible for thoſe <hi>who were once enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened,</hi> and have <hi>taſted</hi> of the Heavenly Gift, and were made <hi>Partakers</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt, and have <hi>taſted</hi> of the <hi>good Word</hi> of God, and <hi>the Powers</hi> of the World to come; if <hi>they ſhall fall away, to renew them again unto Repentance;</hi> ſeeing they crucify to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Son of God afreſh, and put him to an open Shame.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Paſſage evinces, 1ſt. that Perſons may become ſenſible Partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, and taſte of that Divine Power which is the eternal Life of the Bleſſed in the World to come. 2d. That they may apoſtatize from this Condition to ſuch a Degree, that Repentance, and conſequently Salvation, ſhall become impoſſible to them. 3d. That they bring this upon themſelves, becauſe they cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify to themſelves the Son of God afreſh, and put him to an open Shame; they reject and rebel
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:021391_0206_0FB36B1345224520"/>againſt the Invitations of his Spirit in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, till they occaſion it to forſake them, whereby the Divine Witneſs is ſpiritually crucified and ſlain as to its Life in them, and the Chriſtian-name openly reproached through their evil Conduct and Example. This is further illuſtrated by a Simile in the two ſucceeding Verſes.<note place="margin">Heb. vi. 7 and 8.</note> 
                  <q>For the Earth which drinketh in the Rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth Herbs meet for them by whom it is dreſſed, receiveth Bleſſing from God. But that which beareth Thorns and Briars, is rejected, and is nigh unto curſing, whoſe End is to be burned.</q> 
                  <hi>The Rain that cometh oft upon the Earth,</hi> denotes that the Divine Viſitation is frequently renewed to the Soul of Man; and <hi>the Earth which drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it up, and bringeth forth Herbs,</hi> the Soul that affectionately receives, and faithfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains it, ſo as to bring forth the Fruits of the Spirit; whereby it inherits the Bleſſing of God's Salvation. By <hi>the Earth which beareth Thorns and Briars,</hi> is pointed out the Soul that ſo repeatedly continues to reſiſt, and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlide from the Divine Viſitor, as to bring forth, and abide in, wicked Works, which occaſions him to reject and forſake it; the Conſequence whereof muſt be its final Condemnation and Deſtruction.</p>
               <p>This Portion of Scripture thus demonſtrates, both the Certainty of a Day of Divine Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Souls of Men, and the Poſſibility of its being diſcontinued, whilſt they remain in the Body.</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>S. N.</hi> in his Letter, P. 29, having ſaid, <q>Whether God would pardon my Iniquities,

                     <hi>No Matter who,</hi> is in a State of Divine Acceptance and Approbation?</q> Herein I had no Intention to inſinuate, that he meant to exclude all others from an equal Share with him, nor will my Words bear ſuch a Conſtruction. But apprehending, upon his <hi>Predeſtinarian</hi> Principles, that he flattered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he was one of <hi>the perſonally elected,</hi> from ſomething he had read in the New Teſtament, and willing he ſhould not deceive himſelf, I enquired where he found himſelf <hi>particularly</hi> pointed out as one of the Elect.

What I intended was to put him upon Conſideration, that if what he read in the New Teſtament was a <hi>true Relief</hi> to him, his Comfort muſt ariſe either from an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that all Men univerſally have, or that himſelf in particular hath certainly a Share in <hi>the glad Tidings</hi> of the Goſpel; and that, if he did not believe all Men therein comprehended, this comfortable Evidence to himſelf muſt ſpring either from the Holy Spirit bearing Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

               <p n="13">13. He cites <hi>Barclay</hi>'s Definition of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in the Abſtract, and then improperly treats it as in the Concrete, to make it ſuit with the deiſtical Notions of <hi>Tindal,</hi> and prove the <hi>Quakers</hi> Deiſts: A Point he as arduouſly as ineffectually labours. We always under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the natural Conſcience, and the Light of God's Spirit appearing in the Conſcience, as different Principles. The very Eſſence of Deiſm conſiſts in a Denial of Revelation. A Denial of all Divine Revelation is perfect Deiſm. A Denial of it in Part is partial Deiſm. The <hi>Quakers</hi> deny no Part of Divine Revelation; therefore are in no Reſpects to be ſtiled Deiſts. They believe both in the Inſpiration of the Scriptures, and that of the Holy Spirit. Thoſe who diſbelieve either the one or the other, are ſo far deiſtical. He who believes the Sacred Writings were penned by Men inſpired for that Purpoſe, and yet holds that all immediate Inſpiration is now totally with-held, doth, in peruſing the Scriptures, reſt upon his own <hi>private Interpretations,</hi> or that of his Party, as the true Senſe intended by the Holy Ghoſt, and is at beſt a Semi-Deiſt. Such a One has no Right to reproach thoſe with the Name of Deiſts, who believe the Penmen of Scripture
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:021391_0209_0FB36B19600B1C18"/>to have been Inſpired as well as he, and alſo acknowledge the Continuance of Inſpiration, which he doth not. To pretend, that the inſpired Records muſt be needleſs to, and therefore ſet aſide by, thoſe who believe the Continuance of internal Inſpiration, is falſly inferred; for, the Scriptures of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were uſeful to, and uſed by the inſpired Apoſtles; and thoſe who have at Times expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced the Renewals of Inſpiration, know that the Scriptures are often thereby brought to their Remembrance, more clearly opened, and rendered more uſeful and comfortable to them, than it is poſſible for them to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.

It is evident from his own Words, P. 91, that he did not mean the Soul was a Part of the Divine Eſſence; for he there ſpeaks of its being in a State of Death whilſt in Tranſgreſſion, which is not poſſible to the Divine Eſſence, and afterwards adds, <q>Every Man that cometh into the World, having a Light from Chriſt Jeſus (the Way out of the Fall, the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi>) receiving the Light, they receive Redemption and Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, whereby their Spirits, Bodies, and Souls are ſanctified.</q> Here he plainly diſtinguiſhes between the Soul, and that which it receives of the Divine Nature which ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies it.</p>

                  <hi>G.

But I ſhould think it beneath any Perſon of a liberal Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and Character, to copy from thoſe Ill-intenders, or to follow them in ſuch a diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Line.

               <p>P. 155, <hi>S.

Or, Second, if we were actually brought to the Place of Execution, and the King's Son, in his Father's Name, there declared a free and full Pardon to us, on practical Conditions.

                  </q> Here the Apoſtle teaches, that the Goſpel they preached was Chriſt, ſhewing his Face, or <hi>manifeſting himſelf</hi> as the Image of God <hi>in their Hearts;</hi> and that it was only hid, or obſcured in the Minds of thoſe, who through Unbelief therein, or Unfaithfulneſs thereto, were become blinded towards it by him who is called <hi>the God of this World,</hi>

And, amongſt thoſe who are favoured with them, the Variety, and even Contrariety of Opinions and Practices which have all along ſubſiſted, eſpecially among the high Pretenders to, and Poſſeſſors of Literature, all contribute to demonſtrate, that though the Sacred Records, opened by the ſpiritual Key of <hi>David,</hi> are profitable and excellent above all other Writings, yet a more adequate univerſal Guide than themſelves, ever hath been, and now is, abſolutely neceſſary to the Salvation of Mankind.</p>

               <p>When Perſons read, and preſume to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, the Scriptures with School and College Methods uppermoſt in their Heads, it is no Wonder they miſtake them. The inſpired Writers obſerved no ſuch Rules, even thoſe of them who might have a competent Share of Literature; which moſt of them had not. Learned, or unlearned, the Light and Motion of the Holy Spirit was their Guide; not the Rules of Rhetoric, Logic, or Grammar. Is not the Apoſtle <hi>John's Greek</hi> as ordinary as <hi>G.

Hence ariſe Diſagreement, Claſhing, and Jangling about the true Senſe of Scripture; and trying it by the <hi>Notions of Syſtems</hi> they have eſpouſed, inſtead of trying <hi>them</hi> by the Truth, it is no Wonder there is ſo much Controverſy.

               <p>When a Writer, who profeſſes ſo high an Eſteem for the Holy Scriptures, takes ſuch unwarrantable Freedoms with them, as openly to falſify them to ſerve his Purpoſe; his Efforts, inſtead of accompliſhing the Refutation of others, muſt terminate in Self-confuſion.
