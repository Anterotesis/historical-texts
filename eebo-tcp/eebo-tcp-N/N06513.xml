            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>THESE SERMONS</hi> were preached to my own Congregation, without any Deſign of making them pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic; but was induced hereto, as follows: In <hi>March</hi> laſt, I received a Letter from the <hi>COLLEGE</hi> of <hi>NEW-JERSEY,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming me of an extraordinary Appearance of the divine <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Preſence</hi> there, and requeſting I would come and ſee; with this kind Motion I gladly complied, and having been there ſome Time, had all the Evidence of the Reallity of the aforeſaid Report, which
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:008266_0003_102DDD772703A3F0"/>
could be in Reaſon deſired. Of this my dear Brother <hi>WILLIAM</hi> writes thus, <q>I went to the College laſt <hi>Monday,</hi> and ſaw a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable Diſplay of God's Power and Grace in the <hi>Conviction</hi> of <hi>Sinners,</hi> the whole Houſe was a <hi>BOCHIM;</hi> a Senſe of God's Holineſs was ſo impreſſed on the Hearts of its Inhabitants, that all of them, excepting <hi>two</hi> (eſteemed religious) were greatly ſhaken reſpecting the <hi>State</hi> of their <hi>Souls.</hi> This <hi>gracious Ray</hi> reached the <hi>LATIN SCHOOL,</hi> and much affected the <hi>MASTER,</hi> and a Number of the <hi>SCHOLARS;</hi> nor was it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the Students, ſome others were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe awakened: I diſcourſed with all the preſent Members of the College (excepting one) who generally <hi>enquired</hi> with <hi>Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, what they ſhould do to be ſaved;</hi> nor did I ever ſee any, in that Caſe, who had more clear Views of <hi>GOD</hi> and <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> or in any Houſe, more genuine Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for Sin, and Longing for <hi>JESUS;</hi> this bleſſed <hi>Work</hi> of the <hi>MOST HIGH,</hi> ſo far exceeded my Expectation, that I was loſt in Surprize, and conſtrained to ſay, is it ſo, can it be ſo? Nor was my being, Eye and Ear witneſs from <hi>Monday</hi> to <hi>Friday,</hi> able to recover me from my Aſtoniſhment! I felt, as the Apoſtles, when it was told them the Lord had riſen, they could not believe, through
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:008266_0004_102E50D278C1BD48"/>
Fear and great Joy! My Reverend Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and Self, were like thoſe that dream: The Lord hath done great Things for us, whereof we are glad <hi>(Pſ. 126.)</hi> This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Concern was not begun by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Mean of Preaching, or promoted by any alarming Methods, yet ſome were ready to ſink under its Weight; it ſpread like the increaſing Light of the Morning, a wiſe and gracious Providence, had brought about a Concurrence of different Incidents, which tended to engage them to Thoughtfulneſs about their Souls <note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>Incidents</hi> (refered to by my Brother) were eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Several <hi>Letters</hi> reſpecting the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> and <hi>Excellency</hi> of <hi>internal Religion,</hi> ſent to ſome of the <hi>Students,</hi> with practical <hi>Books</hi> of like Tendency: The <hi>Sickneſs</hi> of one of the <hi>Scholars,</hi> in the <hi>College;</hi> his being <hi>awakened</hi> out of Security, at that Time, and ſpeaking to others; together with other Students <hi>ſpeaking</hi> to thoſe about them concerning divine Things.</note>; theſe Things, viewed in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection, manifeſt the Finger of God. The <hi>Freeneſs</hi> of whoſe Grace appears by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that a little before this merciful Viſitation, ſome of the Youth had given a greater Looſe to their <hi>Corruptions,</hi> than was common among them; a Spirit of <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Contention</hi> prevailed, to the great Grief, and almoſt Diſcouragement of the worthy <hi>PRESIDENT.</hi> There was little or

            <p>HERE is an Account of the Creation of Man, in which three Particulars are remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>viz.</hi> The Time, Author, and Manner. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt, AS to the <hi>Time,</hi> it was on the Sixth Day after the other Creatures were made, then Man was formed, to be as it were the <hi>End</hi> and <hi>Compend</hi> of them; in him God deſigned peculiarly to manifeſt the Glory of his Wiſdom, Mercy, and Juſtice: There was a Sort of a Climax or Gradation in the Works of Creation, from Things leſs perfect, to Things more ſo; Man, the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt
<pb n="xxii" facs="unknown:008266_0021_102E51026AFCD260"/>
Creature of this lower World, was made laſt, that the Glory of God, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his other Works, might be declared by him, who was fitted for that Deſign: He was made when all Things were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for his Entertainment and Delight, that ſo he might be the more induced to celebrate the divine Praiſe, for ſo diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing a Benefit. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2d, THE <hi>Author</hi> of his Creation, was the holy <hi>Trinity,</hi> Three in One, and One in Three; <hi>and God ſaid let us make Man.</hi> The Word <hi>ſaid,</hi> being in the ſingular Number, ſhews the Unity of God's Eſſence, and the Word God<note n="‡" place="bottom">Elohim.</note>, being in the Plural, ſhews a Plurality of Perſons in the Godhead. But,</p>
            <p n="3">3d, THE <hi>Manner</hi> of Man's <hi>Creation</hi> was, 1ſt, With <hi>Council; let us make Man.</hi> The Narrative of this is introduced, with a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Diſtinction from the Reſt of the Creation Works: Hitherto only a Word of <hi>Command</hi> had been given for producing the other Works; <hi>and God ſaid, let there be Light, and there was Light,</hi> &amp;c. But now a Council is called, when Man is to be formed; who, under GOD, was the Scope of the Reſt. Some pretend, that God ſpeaks here, after the Manner of <hi>Princes,</hi> in the plural Number, who uſe to ſay, we will, and require, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But hereto it may
<pb n="xxiii" facs="unknown:008266_0022_102E5103F0CEB870"/>
be replied, that this is only the Invention and Practice of latter Times, and no ways agrees with the Simplicity of the firſt Ages, or the Cuſtom of the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> The Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> uſed to ſpeak of themſelves in the ſingular Number, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.28. and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and ſo did the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Monarchs too; <hi>Ezra</hi> 6.8. <hi>I, Darius, make a Decree. Ezra</hi> 7.21. <hi>I, even I, Artaxerexes, the King, do make a Decree.</hi> It is therefore unreaſonable to thruſt the Uſages of modern Stile, into the ſacred Scriptures: Beſides the Lord doth generally ſpeak of himſelf in the ſingular Number, ſome few Places excepted, which are deſigned to ſignify the Myſtery of the Trinity; as particularly, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.22. <hi>The Lord ſaid, the Man is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as one of us;</hi> which ſhews that there are more Perſons than one in the Godhead. Man was to be a Creature, different from all that had been hitherto made, Fleſh and Spirit, Heaven and Earth, muſt be united in him: He muſt be allied to both Worlds, and therefore the Almighty (as it were) calls a Council to the making of him; to repreſent to us his ſuperior Excellency, as well as the Care of God concerning him.</p>
            <p>AND, 2d, Man was made in God's <hi>Image, and after his Likeneſs;</hi> theſe two Words import the ſame Thing (<hi>Gen.</hi> 5.3.) and
<pb n="xxiv" facs="unknown:008266_0023_102E510575BF1050"/>
repreſent to us the exact Likeneſs to God that was in Man originally; he was certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a nearer Reſemblance, than any other of the viſible Creatures, but yet there ever was, and ever will be, an infinite Diſtance between God and him, in reſpect of Dignity and Excellency, CHRIST only <hi>is the expreſs Image of the Father's Perſon,</hi> being of the ſame <hi>Nature</hi> with him: Man is God's Image only, as the Shadow in the Glaſs, or the King's Impreſs upon the Coin. Now the Image of God in Man, was Three-fold, <hi>viz.</hi> Natural, Moral, Political. And 1ſt, The <hi>natural Image</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in Man, conſiſts in the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Faculties</hi> of the <hi>Soul:</hi> The Nature of the Soul was and ſtill is Spiritual, Simple, Inviſible, Immortal, which Properties, do in ſome Meaſure, reſemble the Spirituallity, Simplicity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the ſupream Being: Beſides, the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Soul, <hi>viz.</hi> Underſtanding, Will, and active Power, do reſemble the Mind, Will, and Power of God; add to this, that a Variety of Faculties in one and the ſame Soul, ſeem to ſhadow forth a Plurality of Perſons in the divine Eſſence; ſo that the Soul, conſidered in the aforeſaid Faculties, is, perhaps, the brighteſt Looking-Glaſs in Nature, wherein we may, in ſome Sort, behold God.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="xxv" facs="unknown:008266_0024_102E5108106B27D0"/>2d, The <hi>political Image</hi> of <hi>God</hi> conſiſts in that <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> over the lower Creation which God gave to innocent Man; <hi>and let them have Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over the Fiſh of the Sea, and over the Fowls of the Air, and over all the Earth, and over every creeping Thing that creepeth on the Earth.</hi> The Almighty made innocent Man his <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> upon Earth; he gave him Authority to uſe the inferior Creatures for his Support and Comfort, and to receive Homage from them: An Evidence of this was their coming to him, and receiving Names from him as their Lord. Now the Foundation of this <hi>Dominion,</hi> was the free Gift of God the Creator, as appears from the Words before recited, the reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of which is manifeſt from the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence of Man's Nature to the other Creatures over which he was to preſide; it was fit that that which was leſs perfect, ſhould ſubmit to that which was more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. And the Mean by which this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion was brought to paſs, was the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, by which all the Creatures had a Faculty and Inclination to obey Man: And doubtleſs, the End was God's Glory, that as Man had received all from God, ſo he ſhould refer all the Homage and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice he got from the Creatures to him. But,</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="xxvi" facs="unknown:008266_0025_102E510AF48ACE40"/>3d, THE <hi>moral Image</hi> of <hi>God</hi> conſiſts in a <hi>habitual Conformity</hi> of all the <hi>Powers</hi> of the <hi>Soul</hi> to the whole <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which <hi>Solomon</hi> calls <hi>Uprightneſs;</hi> or, in thoſe divine Gifts of <hi>Knowledge, Righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> which were poſſeſſed by them; the <hi>Mind</hi> was adorned with <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> or the Knowledge of Things, divine and human, which appeared in our firſt Parents giving Names to all the living Creatures, ſuited to their Natures, and in his knowing, at firſt Sight, that <hi>Eve</hi> was formed out of a Rib of his Side; and indeed, without Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he would have been unfit to govern the Creatures, unfit to take <hi>Occaſion</hi> from them, to glorify the Creator, and ſo unfit for the Uſe deſigned him, and conſequently Evil: Surely therefore the <hi>Mind</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi> had a true and clear Knowledge of divine Things, without Error or Miſtake; his <hi>Will</hi> alſo was <hi>pliant</hi> to the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> without the leaſt Reluctance; Holineſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and Righteouſneſs towards Man, poſſeſſed the Will (<hi>Eph.</hi> 4.24.) by which it was diſpoſed to deſire what was good, and to receive what was true; and thus, <hi>Adam</hi> not only acknowledged and loved his Creator, but was inclined to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe a <hi>Dominion</hi> only, and not a <hi>Tyranny</hi>
               <pb n="xxvii" facs="unknown:008266_0026_102E510EA1848160"/>
over the Creatures ſubjected to him: And his <hi>Affections</hi> were <hi>regular,</hi> free from inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Appetite, ready to obey the Conduct of his Mind; his Thoughts were free from Vanity, and eaſily fixed upon the beſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; thus beautiful and harmonious was the original State of Man!</p>
            <p>NOW, <hi>Original Righteouſneſs</hi> conſiſted in, or ſprung from all the aforeſaid Particulars; it is called <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> in a large Senſe, foraſmuch as it ſignifies the <hi>habitual Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> of the whole <hi>Man</hi> to GOD and his <hi>Law;</hi> it is termed <hi>Original,</hi> becauſe it was confered on <hi>Adam,</hi> as a <hi>public Perſon,</hi> or upon the whole human Nature in him; from whom it would have been propagated to all his Offspring, if he had ſtood. It is likewiſe called <hi>Original,</hi> by Way of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, from all that actual Holineſs, which has been ſince confered upon any of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Offspring. Original Righteouſneſs was no <hi>Subſtance,</hi> as ILLIRICUS dreamed, but a <hi>Quality;</hi> which was, as it were, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed through all the Subſtance, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was common to Soul and Body, to the Mind, Will, and Affections; by this Man had a Capacity of Subjection to God, and of perſiſting in Obedience to him; ſo that he was not obliged by any
<pb n="xxviii" facs="unknown:008266_0027_102E5111814F6748"/>
Neceſſity of Nature, to rebel againſt God, and ruin himſelf.</p>
            <p>IT is a very abſurd and dangerous Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which ſome entertain, from the Abuſe of that Paſſage of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> where we are ſaid to be <hi>Partakers of the divine Nature;</hi> that Original Righteouſneſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in Man's having a Part of the divine Being; for, as this ſuppoſes the Almighty to be diviſible, ſo it makes Man equal to his Maker, both which are blaſphemous; all therefore that is intended by the Phraſe, is that good People do partake of holy Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, reſembling the moral Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> but it ſhould be ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, that all the Perfections of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, are finite, dependant, variable;— whereas thoſe of God, are independant, invariable, infinite.</p>
            <p>THE Scriptures poſitively declare, that Man was made originally <hi>upright, Ecleſ.</hi> 7.29. Yea <hi>good,</hi> very <hi>good, Gen.</hi> 1.31. But how could this be, unleſs he had that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual moral Goodneſs, which is proper to Man, and neceſſary to enable him to love and obey his Creator; ſurely ſuch as the Tree is, ſuch are its Fruits, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.18.</p>
            <p>FARTHER, our being renewed after God (by Converſion) in Knowledge, Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Holineſs, <hi>Coll.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.23,
<pb n="xxix" facs="unknown:008266_0028_102E51159C6EB3A8"/>
24. neceſſarily ſuppoſes, that the Image of God conſiſts therein, and that this was Man's original State. It is reaſonable to conclude, from the Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and Purity of God, that Man was made perfect in his Kind, as well as the Angels, <hi>John</hi> 8.44. <hi>Jud.</hi> 6 Ver. But how could this be, if he wanted Wiſdom, Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Holineſs? And indeed, ſeeing the Want of Holineſs in a rational Creature is Sin, if Man was made ſo, God would be the Author of Sin.—The Diſorder of the Fleſh, or <hi>Law of the Members, warring againſt the Law of the Mind,</hi> the Apoſtle calls Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.20, 23. Now if this was con-created with Man, the Almighty would be the Author of Sin, which is as abſurd, as blaſphemous to imagine, of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Pefection, and abſolute Purity!</p>
            <p>ADAM'S <hi>being made a little lower than the Angels,</hi> his free Acceſs to God before his Apoſtacy, the Fear and Shame he diſcovered immediately after it, and his Expulſion from <hi>Eden</hi> on Account of it, evidently ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that he originally enjoyed God's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Image. Farther,</p>
            <p>WE are informed, that <hi>Man was made Male and Female,</hi> and this was doubtleſs for the Comfort of human Life, and the Propagation of the human Race. <hi>Adam</hi>
               <pb n="xxx" facs="unknown:008266_0029_102E511831A79BE0"/>
was firſt formed, which ſhews the Prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence of his Sex, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.11. His <hi>Body was formed of the Duſt of the Ground,</hi> which is indeed a humbling Conſideration, <hi>Duſt we are, and unto Duſt we muſt ſoon return;</hi> the <hi>Woman was formed of a Rib of the Side of the Man,</hi> to ſhew the near Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and tender Affection which ſhould ſubſiſt between them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.5. God made but one Male and Female, that all Nations being of one <hi>Blood,</hi> Deſcendants from one Stock, might thereby be enduced to love each other, and likewiſe to ſhew the Unlawfulneſs of Divorce at Pleaſure, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.4, 5. God having made our firſt Parents, pronounced a <hi>Bleſſing</hi> upon them, in Virtue of which, their Poſterity were to extend to the utmoſt Corners of the Earth, and continue to the final Period of Time.</p>
            <p>BUT before I proceed to the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Subject, let me obſerve ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what upon the two conſtituent Parts of the compound Man, <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Soul;</hi> and, 1ſt, As to the Body, I may ſay, with the Pſalmiſt, that it is <hi>wonderfully made,</hi> if we conſider its erect Stature, Symetry, or Uſe; while the Beaſts have a groveling Aſpect. Man is ſo formed that he can with Eaſe contemplate the Heavens whence he has derived his Original, and ſuch is the
<pb n="xxxi" facs="unknown:008266_0030_102E511AF290A038"/>
               <hi>Symetry</hi> of the Parts of a human Body, that <hi>Architects</hi> refer all their Workmanſhip to be tried by it, as a Rule. Beſides, the Parts are in their Form and Situation, not only <hi>fitted</hi> for <hi>Beauty,</hi> but for all Kinds of <hi>Operations,</hi> natural, moral, and ſpiritual: Add to this, the amazing <hi>Variety</hi> in human Faces, where the Compaſs is ſo ſmall, the Parts, Figure, and Colour the ſame (which is neceſſary to preſerve the Honour and Comfort of ſocial Life, and prevent our Degenerating into a Herd of Beaſts.) The <hi>Preſervation</hi> of <hi>natural Heat,</hi> for ſo long a Time, without inflaming the tender Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals; the <hi>Circulation</hi> of the <hi>Blood,</hi> ſcreen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the noble Parts, from the Ignoble, by the Diaphragma, and from external Injuries, by a ſtrong Incloſure.</p>
            <p>THE Body of Man being formed, it pleaſed God to infuſe into it an immortal <hi>Soul (Gen.</hi> 2.7.) which as to its <hi>Nature,</hi> is an immaterial, incompleat Subſtance, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with Underſtanding and Will, which by its Union with the Body, is the Cauſe of a three-fold Life to Man. And, 1ſt, It is a <hi>Subſtance,</hi> not a mere <hi>Thought,</hi> as <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſe</hi> imagined, becauſe Thought is an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which preſuppoſes an Agent; it appears likewiſe to be a Subſtance, becauſe it ſubſiſts after the Death of the Body. 2d, It is
<pb n="xxxii" facs="unknown:008266_0031_102E511C77FDF818"/>
               <hi>immaterial,</hi> which is evident from its Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, it perceives immaterial Things, and that after an immaterial Manner, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring one Thing with another, and infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one Thing from another. 3d, It is <hi>incompleat,</hi> in reſpect of its being ordained for, and <hi>diſpoſed</hi> to a <hi>Union</hi> with the <hi>Body,</hi> as a Part of the Compound; by which, it differs from the Being of <hi>Angels.</hi> 4th, It is endowed with certain Faculties of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and Will, by which it perceives what is true, and embraces what is good. 5th, By its <hi>Union</hi> with the <hi>Body,</hi> it is the inſtrumental Cauſe of that manifold <hi>Life</hi> which Man lives, <hi>viz.</hi> 1ſt, <hi>Vegetative;</hi> by which we are nouriſhed, grow, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pogate our Kind. 2d, <hi>Senſitive;</hi> by which we diſcern and judge of ſenſible Things, by the Help of the Five outward Senſes, Hearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as well as of the three inward, <hi>viz.</hi> Common Senſe, Fancy, and Memory. 3d, <hi>Rational;</hi> by which we diſcern ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Objects, and are able to reaſon about them. On the Account of that three-fold Life mentioned, the Soul is termed the Spirit of Lives, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.7. It may be far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obſerved, that the compound Man was ſo made, as to have no direct Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to a Diſſolution, he would have been preſerved for ever from Death, had he not
<pb n="xxxiii" facs="unknown:008266_0032_102E511F1974A1D0"/>
ſinned; and therefore Death is threatened as the Reward of Sin, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.20.</p>
            <p>I NEED not add, that the Deſign of Man's Creation, was doubtleſs the Glory of the great God; for that was the End of all his Works, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.4. The ſtupendous Workmanſhip of GOD, throughout the vaſt Univerſe, was ſummed up in Man, as a Compend of the Whole! Man was fitted with a Capacity to Experience the Goodneſs of all the Creatures in himſelf, and to return to God the Glory of it. But I haſten to the Improvement. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt, THE Conſideration of our Creation, ſhould invite our Gratitude to our Creator, becauſe he has made us, whom he could have left in the State of Nothing; and eſpecially, becauſe he adorned us with his <hi>Image,</hi> hereby diſtinguiſhing us from, and advancing us above all the lower Creation, and that out of pure and unexcited Affection towards us. How holy, and how happy was the original State of Man, he was not only conformed to the divine <hi>Nature,</hi> but had the Enjoyment of the divine <hi>Love,</hi> in Conſequence thereof; both Body and Soul were beautified with ſingular Endowments, and enriched with a Variety of Honours and Delights! O therefore let us eſteem, love, and ſerve our great, our good Creator, let
<pb n="xxxiv" facs="unknown:008266_0033_102E51209EC9BE90"/>
us remember him from our early Age, <hi>Ecle.</hi> 12.1. let us ſpeak of his Goodneſs, ſubject ourſelves to his Government, and refer our All to his Glory: This is juſt, for God has abſolute Dominion over us, he is our Potter; this is grateful, for <hi>Jehovah</hi> is our Benefactor; this is reaſonable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is a Being of infinite Excellency, and hereby we are like to obtain his Favour, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 103.13.</p>
            <p n="2">2d, THE Thoughts of Man's <hi>original State,</hi> may excite us to bewail our preſent apoſtate Condition, <hi>The Crown is fallen from our Heads, woe is us that we have ſinned:</hi>— Our antient Conformity to God, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him, are now loſt, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Diſorders have ſeized our whole Frame; the original <hi>Craſis</hi> of the Humours of our Bodies is broken, and now they are expoſed to all Manner of Diſeaſes and Deaths, of various Form! Darkneſs poſſeſſes our Minds, Obſtinacy our Wills, and great Irregularity our Affections; we who were at firſt Lords of the inferior Creatures, are now become Slaves to them! we are deprived of the Sweets of the divine Love by Sin, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the dreadful Diſpleaſure of our Creator! (<hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3.) O therefore let us bitterly bewail our preſent woeful State! If <hi>Rachael,</hi> when baniſhed with her Children,
<pb n="xxxv" facs="unknown:008266_0034_102E51256840E6B0"/>
from the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Country, and carried Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Borders, did ſo lament a ſmall Miſery, that ſhe refuſed to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, ſhall not we lament, who are ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from Paradiſe, diſrobed of Innocence, berieved of Happineſs, and thruſt into a State of the moſt miſerable Captivity, by our own Default!</p>
            <p n="3">3d, THE Thoughts of our primitive Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and Happineſs, ſhould excite us with all Earneſtneſs to ſeek the Recovery of it. Let us remember whence we are fallen, and do our firſt Works; it will not avail us to cry, O miſerable Man! without this be added to it, who ſhall deliver me? If the Woman that loſt the Piece of Silver, light a Candle, ſwept the Houſe, and ſought diligently for it till ſhe found it; ſhall not we be diligent, who have loſt our All at a Stroke, eſpecially conſidering that there is great Hopes of our obtaining it, in the Way of humble and unwearied Labour; and ſurely the Good we ſeek, will infinitely over-ballance our Pains in Queſt of it! It may be recovered in Part in this Life, by Regeneration and Juſtification, and with Advantage in the Life to come, by eternal Glorification. But how ſhould we ſeek it? 1ſt, By lamenting our Loſs, and eſpecially Sin, the Cauſe of it. 2d, By embracing
<pb n="xxxvi" facs="unknown:008266_0035_102E51282D669AB8"/>

               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:008266_0038_102E512FF89E1C30"/>NOW the dangerous and mortal DISEASE we labour under, is SIN; which is two-fold, <hi>viz.</hi> ORIGINAL and ACTUAL; it is the former of theſe that the Text under our preſent Conſideration treats; to underſtand which, let it be conſidered; that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle is therein comparing the Firſt and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam,</hi> in reſpect of the World's being corrupted by the one, and reſtored by the other.</p>
            <p>WHEREFORE it is as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, ſeeing Things are ſo in reſpect of the Benefits received by Chriſt, as I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in the preceeding Verſes, then it is evident that what was loſt by <hi>Adam,</hi> is reſtored by CHRIST: This he proceeds to illuſtrate, by ſhewing particularly what the Loſs was, which we ſuſtain by our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents Treſpaſs, both in reſpect of Integrity and Happineſs; <hi>by one Man Sin entered into the World, and Death by Sin;</hi> here obſerve, that Man is the Parent of Corruption; altho' the Devil ſinned before Man, yet he did not Sin to Man, but to himſelf; he was indeed the Procurer of Man's Sin by his Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but not the Committer of it; and therefore it was not from his Seduction, but Man's Tranſgreſſion, that Sin entered into the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:008266_0039_102E51329B1E8CF8"/>BUT who was this Man? <hi>A.</hi> ADAM, and EVE; though theſe were two in reſpect of Sex, yet they were but one by Nature and Mariage; <hi>Eve</hi> began the Sin, and <hi>Adam</hi> finiſhed it; nor does it paſs to Poſterity till it be finiſhed (<hi>Gen.</hi> ii. 17.) But why is not <hi>Eve</hi> named? <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe the <hi>Hebrews</hi> do not cite Genealogies by Women, and becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> was conſtituted the Parent and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal of the human Race, and was one with <hi>Eve,</hi> not only oeconomically but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally; for ſhe was made out of him, and depended upon him: But why is one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

            <p>SIN <hi>entered;</hi> the Word is not taken here improperly, for the Puniſhment of Sin, as it is in ſome other Places of Scripture, but properly for moral Impurity, becauſe it is diſtinguiſhed from Death, from Puniſhment; <hi>Sin entered into the World, and Death by Sin:</hi> Sin is ſpoken of in the ſingular Number, as it is frequently in the following Verſes, to ſhew that one Sin of our firſt Parents paſſed to their Poſterity; one Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> only was natural, the reſt were perſonal: But what was that one Sin of which the Apoſtle
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:008266_0040_102E51341DE03180"/>
ſpeaks? <hi>A.</hi> It was that actual Sin, which our firſt Parents committed by eating the forbidden Fruit, and the Guilt thereof which are charged upon <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity, becauſe the Prohibition did not reſpect him only, but them alſo whom he repreſented; this is commonly called original Sin imputed; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Polution conſequent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, conſiſting in a want of original Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and Propenſity to all Evil; this has ſtained the whole human Nature, as both Scripture and ſad Experience witneſs, and from this fatal Fountain all actual Evils flow; this Polution or Depravity, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called Original Sin inherent.</p>
            <p>NOW the Apoſtle aſſures us, that this Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> has entered into the World; by the Word <hi>World,</hi> we are to underſtand all the Inhabitants of the World, or all Men, as the Apoſtle himſelf expreſſes it, in the following Part of the Verſe: The Thing containing, is put for the Perſons contained, by a uſual Metonimy; but how did Sin enter into the World? I anſwer, not by <hi>Imitation,</hi> for then it would not paſs upon thoſe, that had not ſinned after the Similitude of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Tranſgreſſion, which the Scriptures aſſure us it did: It therefore entered into the World at firſt by the <hi>Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs</hi> of our firſt Parents, and is therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:008266_0041_102E5137D1B30D38"/>
propagated by natural Generation; as appears by the next Words of the Text, <hi>and ſo Death paſſed upon all Men.</hi> What Death? <hi>A.</hi> All that Death which was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, to the three-fold Life that Man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, while in a State of Innocence, <hi>viz.</hi> Natural, Spiritual, Eternal. This Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, the Law of Contraries, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Form of Expreſſion give Ground for.</p>
            <p>NOW ſurely the Puniſhment could not paſs upon all, without the Cauſe thereof, the Sin together with it; for the Judge of all the Earth muſt needs do right: And hence we may learn, that Original Sin is propagated after the ſame Manner, that Death is, <hi>viz.</hi> by natural Generation; Men are begotten ſinful, and ſo by conſequence mortal, for by Sin came Death.</p>
            <p>IN the following Words of the Text, we have an Account of the reaſon of the Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Sin and Death to all Mankind, and it is this, <hi>for that all have ſinned;</hi> ſome ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Words, <hi>Eph o,</hi> in which, and ſo theſe Words are taken in many Places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.2, 3.8. 3. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.5. and divers other Places which it is needleſs to mention; and that it is to be taken ſo in our Text, the Apoſtle informs us, by that parallel Place of Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22. <hi>for as in</hi> Adam <hi>all die, ſo in Chriſt all ſhall be
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:008266_0042_102E513A642036F8"/>
made alive:</hi> This ſacred Paſſage is a preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Proof, that <hi>Adam</hi> was a Repreſentative of his whole Poſterity, and it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that the aforeſaid Words are ſo ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the Margin of our Bibles, IN WHOM: But if our Tranſlation be retained, it is much to the ſame Senſe, for if the Wages of Sin be Death, and ſuch do die, as never committed actual Sin themſelves, as Infants do; then it will follow neceſſarily, that they ſinned in this one Man, in whoſe Loins they were; as <hi>Levi</hi> is ſaid to have paid Tithes in the Loins of <hi>Abram (Heb.</hi> 7.9.) and hence it is as expreſly and categorically aſſerted, in the following Verſes (<hi>viz.</hi> 15. and 18) as any Thing can be, that <hi>by the Offence of one many are Dead,</hi> and that <hi>by the Offence of one, Judgment came on all to Condemnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS apoſtolical Concluſion, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>by the Offence of one, Judgment has come upon all Men to Condemnation,</hi> or, in other Words, that the Guilt of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin is imputed to all his Offspring, is the important Point, that I would eſſay to evince in this Diſcourſe, by Scripture and Reaſon, and to anſwer Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections to the contrary; but previous there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, give me Leave to offer ſome Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that tend to caſt Light upon the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Subject.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:008266_0043_102E513D036264E0"/>HERE let it be obſerved, that there are two Things conſiderable in Sin, <hi>viz.</hi> its Guilt and Polution, the former binds us to ſuffer Puniſhment while Impenitent, by the Threatning annexed to the Violation of the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>the Soul that ſinneth ſhall die,</hi> which divine Juſtice and Truth are engaged to iſſue; but the latter, <hi>viz.</hi> the Polution of Sin, degrades and corrupts the Soul, by making it (in its general Temper and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition) contrary to GOD'S Nature and Law; the firſt is removed by Juſtification, through the Righteouſneſs of CHRIST, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted and received by Faith; and the latter by Regeneration and Sanctification, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by pious Principles or Habits are infuſed and confirmed, through the bleſſed Influence of the Holy Spirit, co-operating with the Means of Grace, and Dealings of Providence: Both theſe Graces are neceſſary to Salvation, the one to give a Title to it, and the other to make us meet to enjoy it; and though they are different, yet they are inſeparable; all that are juſtified by Faith, are regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and ſanctified by the Holy Spirit; for that Faith which juſtifies, purifies the Heart, and works by Love. In order to make what I have now offered eaſy to be underſtood, by thoſe that are weak and ignorant, give me Leave to uſe this humble Simile, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:008266_0044_102E513FA369F2D0"/>
ſuppoſing a Leprous Perſon was condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be burnt for ſome atrocious Crime, the Prince's Pardon would not cure the Leproſy, no, there muſt be another Sort of Medicine uſed to that Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>BUT what is SIN? I anſwer in the Words of the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> that it is <hi>a Tranſgreſſion of the Law,</hi> or a being without the Law, or not conformed to it; theſe Things the original Word <hi>anomia,</hi> ſignifies.</p>
            <p>A LAW in general may be thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is a Rule of Things to be done, and avoided, enacted by compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Authority, and enforced by the Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Rewards and Puniſhments.</p>
            <p>THE Law of GOD in this, differs from the Laws of ſecular Princes, that it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes Limits to the Temper and Acts of the Mind, as well as to the Speech and overt Actions of the Life: For the Mind is the Man, the internal Principles that Men act from, as well as their Views and Frames in acting, are indeed the chief Things that conſtitute the Goodneſs or Badneſs of Action; and they being all open to the Eye of God, it is but right, that the Father of Spirits (from whom the Law proceeds) the juſt Judge of the Univerſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhould preſcribe Rules for, take Cognizance of, and reward or puniſh them according to
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:008266_0045_102E5142379C9A50"/>
their different Natures, and Degrees of Goodneſs or Malignity: But earthly Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates having no Knowledge of the Heart, or Empire over it, are utterly diſqualified for ſo arduous a Province; and the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of civil Laws being only to preſerve external Order and Right in the State, if theſe Things be obſerved, its End is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: But it is not ſo in Reſpect of the Laws of GOD, there the Spring and Scope of Action, which are concealed from, and impenetrable to human Cognizance, are principally regarded; there the leaſt Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in the Temper of the Soul, or in any of its Acts, Diſpoſitions, and Deſigns, to that perfect and univerſal Purity the Law requires of all intelligent Beings, is a Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Limits preſcribed by it, and therefore Sin.</p>
            <p>THE original right of Power among Men, ariſes either from Generation in Nature, Preſervation in War, or ſome public Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice done to Society: Thus the Juriſdiction and Dominion of <hi>Jehovah</hi> over Mankind, is founded in his Propriety in them, and that ariſes from his giving to them their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and all their Benefits; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.21. <hi>Remember O</hi> Iſrael, <hi>for thou art my Servant, I have formed thee.</hi> From hence a ſupream Right of Legiſlation naturally iſſues; in a
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:008266_0046_102E514645D6EF20"/>
Word, GOD'S right to Rule over us, is founded on Juſtice, for <hi>he has made us, and not we ourſelves, we are the People and Sheep of his Paſture;</hi> his abſolute Property: It is alſo founded on Gratitude and Reaſon, for from him we have received innumerable and very valuable Benefits; and the infinite and tranſcendant Excellency of his Nature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the higheſt Eſteem, and qualifies him for ſupream Rule; hence it appears, that every Sin is unjuſt, ungrateful, and irrational, for it robs God of his Right (of the Homage and Service due to him) vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the Laws of Gratitude, and ſlights tranſcendant Excellency. Now</p>
            <p>THE Laws of Religion are of two Kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> moral and poſitive; the former are founded in Reaſon and Equity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are immutable and perpetual; enjoined becauſe they are intrinſically Good; but the latter, <hi>viz.</hi> poſitive Laws, proceed from God's ſovereign Pleaſure, without regard had to the intrinſic Goodneſs and Value of Things, and therefore are good only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are enjoined, and alterable by the Authority that enjoined them, being in themſelves indifferent: An Example of the former we have in the moral Law, and of the latter, in the Precepts to abſtain
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:008266_0047_102E5147CBE28AA0"/>
from the Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.</p>
            <p>MAN, at his firſt Creation, was ſubject to the Law of Nature; which contains theſe Rules or Maxims concerning moral Good and Evil, which have an intrinſic, invari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Equity in them, and are the Meaſure, Standard, and Scale of the Offices he owes to God, his Neighbour, and himſelf: This Law is Holy, as it enjoins an Imitation of thoſe divine Attributes, which are the Source and Pattern of Purity; Juſt, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires us to give to every one his Due, and, Good, as it recommends Charity and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, and is profitable to the Obſerver of it; for in keeping this Law, there is a great Reward, even in this Life.</p>
            <p>TO the Law of Nature, was annexed the poſitive Precept to abſtain from eating the Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Reaſons, <hi>viz.</hi> to manifeſt God's Sovereignty, and to try the Creature's Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
            <p>JEHOVAH being the Almighty Creator, is of Conſequence the abſolute Proprietor, and Sovereign Lord of all; and therefore Man could have but a ſecondary right of Uſe to his Poſſeſſions, founded on the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Beneficence, and limited by his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; for which he is obliged to render
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:008266_0048_102E51494EAD37A8"/>
Homage: As Princes when they give Eſtates to their Subjects, ſtill retain the Royalty, and receive a ſmall Rent, which though inconſiderable in itſelf, perhaps but a Barley Corn, is nevertheleſs an Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of their Sovereignty, and of the Tenants Dependance on them: Thus it was in regard of the Tree of Knowledge, abſtaining from the Fruit thereof, was a Token of Man's Subjection to, and Depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on his great and glorious Sovereign; nor could any Thing be better adapted to try Obedience, than the Prohibition of what was in itſelf indifferent, and only became unlawful by the Creator's Pleaſure: For in this View the Precept had no other Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency to recommend it, but the Authority or Will of God, and therefore to abſtain was pure Obedience to divine Sovereignty, without any Motive from the intrinſic Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Things enjoined, whereby the Creature's natural Liberty was reſtrained.</p>
            <p>THIS Law of Nature being in a great Degree effaced by the Sin of Man, a new Edition was given of it upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> on Tables of Stone, wrote by the Finger of GOD himſelf, which is called the moral Law, becauſe it preſcribes Rules for the Conduct of Life, or Regulation of Mens Manners, and likewiſe to diſtinguiſh it from
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008266_0049_102E514ADD7DAAD8"/>
Laws purely poſitive: I ſay, this Law of Nature, or moral Law, which is the ſame in Subſtance, in Conjunction with a poſitive Precept of abſtaining from the Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, was delivered to our firſt Parents in the Form of a Covenant, which was a Fruit of ineffable Wiſdom and Goodneſs.</p>
            <p>FOR the COVENANT being mutual be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween GOD and Man, as it gave an Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the reward to coroberate his Faith, ſo it was the ſureſt Bond to preſerve his Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dility: It is true, the Precept alone binds by the Authority that impoſes it, but the Conſent of the Creature increaſes and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dears the Obligation!</p>
            <p>THE Almighty might have demanded the Creature's Obedience to his Sovereign Pleaſure, meerly by way of abſolute Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; but he was pleaſed to deal with Man in a more condeſcending, engaging Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by uſing ſuch Arguments to enforce his Authority, as were adapted to Influence his Reaſon and Ingenuity, his Fear and Love!</p>
            <p>NOW the Terms of the firſt Covenant, my Brethren, are rational, for they eſtabliſh an inſeparable Connection between Sin and Ruin expreſly, and between Duty and Happineſs implicitly, as appears by the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:008266_0050_102E51514B997B80"/>
Sanction, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. <hi>In the Day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die;</hi> in that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Species of Sin, the whole Genus was included, according to the Apoſtle's Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Curſed is every one, that continueth not in all Things, that are written in the Book of the Law to do them:</hi> The Death deſigned was not only a Diſſolution of the vital Union between the Soul and Body, together with all the painful Preludes which uſher in this King of Terrors; but likewiſe a Diſſolution of the myſtical (or ſpiritual) Union between God and the Soul, whereby his moral Image, and Communion in his Love were loſt; together with a final Separation from his gracious Preſence for ever; under all which our apoſtate Nature labours: Thus the Law is interpreted by the Lawgiver, <hi>the Soul that Sins ſhall die, Ezek.</hi> 18.4. and elſewhere the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> declares, that <hi>the Wages of Sin is Death, but the Gift of</hi> GOD <hi>eternal Life, through</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>our Lord (Rom.</hi> 6.23.) Here obſerve, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of Sin indefinitely, without any Reſtriction, and therefore intends every Sin, and ſets the Wages of Sin (<hi>viz.</hi> Death) in Contraſt with, or Oppoſition to eternal Life, and therefore declares by the Antithesis or Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that it is Eternal; and this is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:008266_0051_102E5152D06ACDF8"/>
in particular to the Sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> in the laſt Verſe of the Chapter, from whence our Text is taken, in theſe memorable Words; <hi>That as Sin reigned unto Death, even ſo might Grace reign through Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto eternal Life, by</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>our Lord:</hi> Now inaſmuch as the Miſeries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent upon our Apoſtacy, are in divers Verſes of this Chapter, ſet in Oppoſition to the Benefits received by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to reſtrict the Word Death to that which is Temporal only, is in Effect to deny all the Spiritual and Eternal Benefits purchaſed by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam,</hi> which is ſuch a ſhocking Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, as tends to overſet at once the whole Goſpel, and all the Chriſtians Hope and Joy! and elſewhere we are informed, that <hi>the Letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth Life,</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6.) <hi>i. e.</hi> the Law condemns the Sinner to eternal Death, but the Goſpel gives eternal Life: Was not this the Deſign of Chriſt's coming into the World, that <hi>thoſe who believe in him ſhould not periſh, but obtain eternal Life? (John</hi> 3.16.)</p>
            <p>AND indeed it is highly reaſonable, that eternal Death ſhould be the Wages of Sin, conſidering it oppoſes all the immenſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the Deity, and violates all the innumerable, endearing and infinite Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations we are laid under to ſerve him, by

Reaſon of his Eminence, and his Love: If the Threatning of eternal Puniſhment, has but little Influence upon the moſt of Men, how much leſs would that of Temporary? And if the Sinner who deſerves Death, ſhould enjoy Life, without Satisfaction made for his Offence, divine Wiſdom would be eclipſed, the Rights of Juſtice infringed, the Purity of GOD diſparaged, and his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Authority inſulted and contemned!</p>
            <p>BUT becauſe many have too ſlight Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of the Heinouſneſs of our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents Treſpaſs, it may not be improper to obſerve, that the following awful Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients are contained in it, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. UNBELIEF, or Diſtruſt of GOD, who had ſaid, that if they Eat of the Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, they ſhould ſurely die; the Truth of which Declaration they queſtioned, and ſo <hi>made God a Liar,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> obſerves, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.16. ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Blaſphemy! As Obedience is the Fruit of Faith, ſo is Diſobedience of Unbelief; and as the Former comes by hearing the Word of GOD, ſo the Latter by liſtning to the Devil.</p>
            <p n="2">2. ANOTHER Iniquity included in the Sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> is a BELIEF of the DEVIL, who in order to weaken the Faith of our firſt Parents, ſuggeſted that they ſhould not
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:008266_0053_102E51561D0060A0"/>
ſurely die: Obſerve, he did not directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the divine Threatning, by an expreſs Contradiction, for that might have ſhocked them, but laboured ſlyly by Degrees to weaken their Aſſent to it, by ſaying, <hi>ye ſhall not ſurely die,</hi> as if he had ſaid, the Execution of the Threatning is not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely certain, you may poſſibly eſcape with Impunity, though you do tranſgreſs; this Suggeſtion of the Father of Lies, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and conſequently preferred a Liar, and a Murderer, before the GOD of Truth and Love!</p>
            <p n="3">3. THEY charged the bleſſed GOD with the greateſt Cruelty and Meanneſs, as tho' he ENVIED their HAPPINESS, after all his Benignity, Indulgence and Gentleneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them; this was repreſenting him to be like a Devil; the Enemy ſuggeſted, that in the Day they eat thereof, they ſhould be as Gods, knowing Good and Evil, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. this they believed, and were ſeduced.</p>
            <p n="4">4. IN the Sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> was included amazing ARROGANCE; he who had but juſt ſtarted out of a State of Nothing, aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be a God; not content with the Image of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> he affected to rival him in his Attributes, and of Conſequence to uſurp his Throne, and grapple with him for his Crown and Scepter! Strange that a
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:008266_0054_102E515C6BF63620"/>
Worm of the Earth who was but of Ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday, ſhould ſo ſoon forget his humble Original, and contend with the Deity, for his incommunicable Prerogatives!</p>
            <p n="5">5. ANOTHER Ingredient graſped in that many headed HYDRA, is INGRATITUDE; one of the worſt of Evils, the Heinouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of which encreaſes in Proportion to the Number and Moment of the Benefits ſlighted by it; the Almighty had ſhewn more Kindneſs to Man, than to all his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Works beſides; he made him laſt of all, as the Crown to the whole material Syſtem, adorned him with his own Image, ſeated him in EDEN, a Paradiſe of Delight; gave him Liberty to eat of the Fruit of all the Trees thereof, but of one (which he needed not) gave him Power to obey his Laws, and Communion in his Love; and in fine, advanced him to the higheſt Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, by making him Lord of the Lower Creation; now in the Midſt of all this rich Profuſion of the Divine Benignity, this vaſt Variety of the moſt deſirable and valuable Benefits, to violate a Precept ſo equal and of ſo eaſy Obſervance, is ſuch a Prodigy of Ingratitude, as is without compare. But,</p>
            <p n="6">6. ANOTHER Ingredient included in that pregnant Impiety, is REBELLION againſt the Authority of GOD; the Almighty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:008266_0055_102E515E54A34F58"/>
declared his Will, that our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, <hi>ſhould not Eat of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, upon Pain of Death:</hi> Yet they impudently ſet up their Will againſt GOD, and preferred their Pleaſure to his; agreeable to that impious and obſtinate Maxim, <hi>Sic volo, ſic jubeo, ſtet pro ratione voluntas;</hi> My Will and Pleaſure ſhall be Law, and take the Place of Reaſon and Argument; in a Word, they made their Necks as an Iron Sinew, and their Brow Braſs! Again,</p>
            <p n="7">7. SORDID DISCONTENT, Covetouſneſs, and Robbing of GOD were contained in that original complicated Treſpaſs: They were diſſatisfied with all the Affluence of Good they enjoyed, they inordinately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to have more than God gave them, any how; <hi>(per fas nefaſ<expan>
                     <am>

                  </expan>)</hi> and did actually take of the Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, which they had no right to, without Leave of the Owner, yea contrary to his expreſs Prohibition. Farther,</p>
            <p n="8">8. IT included provoking IDOLATRY, and a haughty Contempt of God's Majeſty, they turned from God to the Creature, loved it more than him, and deſired to have it rather than the Continuance of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: Yea they made an Idol of a little Fruit, ſet it up in the Place of God, and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:008266_0056_102E515FDBF64788"/>
preferred it before him, who is the firſt Truth, the ſupream Good, GOD over all, bleſſed for ever; they were not awed by the Greatneſs of his Power, nor influenced by the Riches of his Gentleneſs, of his Love and Goodneſs; the former did not awake their Fear, nor the latter excite their Ingenuity; the Thoughts of <hi>Jehovah</hi>'s Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and the Severity of his Threatnings, they inſolently deſpiſed, and would tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, even under the Eye of God; they bid Defiance to Omnipotence, and ruſhed upon the thick Boſſes of his Bucklers; they mocked at Fear, and were not affrighted, yea, like the <hi>Leviathan,</hi> they laughed at the ratling of the Spear, and the Shield, as if they had an Arm like God, and could Thunder with a Voice like him; who if he but touch the Mountains they ſmoke, yea, the Hills tremble at his Preſence. But to proceed,</p>
            <p n="9">9. IN the Sin of our firſt Parents are contained, perfidious BREACH of COVE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NANT, and deviliſh APOSTACY; they had but lately entered into Covenant with the Divine Majeſty, and promiſed to ſerve him, and abſtain from the forbidden Fruit; but behold in an Inſtant, and on a ſlight Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, they break Friendſhip with GOD, revolt from his Allegiance, and conſpire
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:008266_0057_102E516160CE25C8"/>
with the grand Enemy, againſt his Crown and Dignity: O horrid Treaſon, O mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Impiety! Once more,</p>
            <p n="10">10. I may add to the aforeſaid malignant and crimſon Ingredients, graſped in the Sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſtupid FOLLY, and bloody CRUELTY, to all his numerous Progeny, in ſelling his and their Salvation for a Thing of Nought; in Bartering away the Favour of GOD, which is better than Life, for the Pleaſures of Taſte and Curioſity; what but voluntary Madneſs, could enduce him to deſire that which ſhould have been the Object of his conſtant Fear, <hi>viz.</hi> the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Evil, ſeeing nothing but the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of this, could deſtroy his Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Thus <hi>Men being in Honour, abode not, but become like the Beaſts that periſh, (Pſ.</hi> 49.12). <hi>Adam</hi> was entruſted with the inexpreſſibly, important, and precious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitum of his own eternal Happineſs, and that of all his Numberleſs Deſcendants, in every Clime and Nation, and through every Succeſſion of Time, to its final Period: This immenſe Truſt of greater Value than Millions of Worlds, though turned into the fineſt Gold, and richeſt Jewels, he knowingly and wilfully betrayed; and thus he commenced a Murderer before a Parent! Thus he diſenherited all his unhappy Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:008266_0058_102E5162E55E6800"/>
before they were born! and made them Slaves, before they knew the Value of Liberty! an Inſtance this of Perfidy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Parallel; an Inſtance this of Cruelty, which no Words, no Colours are ſufficient, (adequately) to delineate or expreſs!</p>
            <p>AND yet, my Brethren, that Iniquity, with all its Ingredients and Aggravations, is ours, becauſe committed by our Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative, and foederal Head, acting in our Room and Place. <hi>Wherefore as by one Man Sin entered into the World, and Death by Sin, and ſo Death paſſed upon all Men, for that all have ſinned:</hi> O mournful Tragedy, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be deplored with Tears and Blood! But becauſe ſome inſtead of acknowledging this complicated Guilt, and bewailing this fatal Source of every Sin and Woe, to which both their Duty and their Intereſt oblige them; yet through the Ignorance, Pride, and Deceitfulneſs of their Hearts, they diſpute or deny the Point, to their own unſpeakable Prejudice; I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the following Part of this Diſcourſe, endeavour to prove the Charge againſt all the human Race, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT THE GUILT OF THE SIN OF ADAM, IS IMPUTED TO ALL HIS OFF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SPRING.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:008266_0059_102E5169DA5ADF38"/>THIS appears from the following Places of ſacred Scripture, <hi>viz. Epheſ.</hi> 2.3. <hi>and were by Nature Children of Wrath, even as others;</hi> here obſerve, that there is a Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between Nature and Practice; now if we be by Nature Children of Wrath, we muſt be by Nature guilty of ſome Sin that deſerves it; for ſurely the Judge of all the Earth muſt needs do right; and what can this natural Evil be, but the aforeſaid Sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> for from him we derived our Nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Whatſoever the Law ſays, it ſays to thoſe that are under the Law, that every Mouth may be ſtopped, and the whole World become guilty before God;</hi> compared with <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>for we have before proved, both</hi> Jews <hi>and</hi> Gentiles, <hi>that they are all under Sin;</hi> here obſerve, that the whole World are guilty before GOD; how? not all of them by actual Sin; for all of them have not committed it, Infants are incapable of it, and they are a conſiderable Part of the World; then ſurely the Sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> in Eating the forbidden Fruit, muſt be imputed or reckoned to all; ſee likewiſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.21, 22. <hi>for ſince by Man came Death, by Man came alſo the Reſurrection of the Dead; for as in</hi> Adam <hi>all die, ſo in</hi> CHRIST <hi>ſhall all be made alive;</hi> now if we compare with this, what the Apoſtle ſays elſewhere, <hi>viz.
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:008266_0060_102E516C752F3048"/>
Rom.</hi> 6.23. <hi>for the Wages of Sin is Death:</hi> Will it not plainly prove that we are ſome how guilty of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin? For how elſe ſhould the Wages due for it, be inflicted on us? Yea, <hi>upon thoſe that have not ſinned after the Similitude of</hi> Adam; that is, who have not ſinned actually in their own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: See <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.13, 14, 15. <hi>for until the Law, Sin was in the World, but Sin is not imputed where there is no Law;</hi> the Apoſtle is there proving, that Sin was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, before the moral Law was given upon Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> becauſe Man had the ſame for Subſtance written in his Heart; and adds theſe Words, <hi>nevertheleſs Death reigned from</hi> Adam <hi>to</hi> Moſes, <hi>even over them who had not ſinned after the Similitude of</hi> Adam<hi>'s Tranſgreſſion, who is the Figure of him that was to come;</hi> i. e. though the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law was not given outwardly by <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet Death, the Wages of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over ſuch as did not actually imitate it; the Apoſtle certainly points to Infants, in the aforeſaid Expreſſion, who die before the Uſe of Reaſon; Death reigns over them, though they have not ſinned after the Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Tranſgreſſion; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Guilt of his Sin is imputed to them; this is indeed the Drift of the Apoſtle's rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning in our Context, and therefore he calls
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:008266_0061_102E516DF8D34590"/>
               <hi>Adam, a</hi> FIGURE <hi>of him that was to come;</hi> i. e. of CHRIST; now wherein is the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> a FIGURE of the Second, but in theſe Things following, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. IN his being a Covenant Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, of foederal Head of his natural Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, as Chriſt is of his Spiritual. And,</p>
            <p n="2">2. THAT as by the Sin of the Firſt, Guilt and Death were imputed to, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on his natural Offspring, ſo by the Obedience of the Second, Righteouſneſs and Life are imputed to, and conferred upon his ſpiritual Offspring.</p>
            <p>IT appears with the cleareſt Light and Evidence, from the following Verſes, that what I have ſaid is the Apoſtle's Scope and Meaning; ſee Verſes 16, 18, 19. <hi>For the Judgment was by one to Condemnation, but the free Gift is of many Offences to Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; therefore as by the Offence of one, Judgment came upon all Men to Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even ſo by the Righteouſneſs of one, the free Gift came upon all to Juſtification of Life; for as by one Man's Diſobedience many were made Sinners, ſo by the Obedience of one, ſhall many be made Righteous;</hi> what can be expreſſed in plainer and ſtronger Terms than this Truth in theſe Verſes, <hi>viz.</hi> that we are after the ſame Manner condemned by the Sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> as we are juſtified by
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:008266_0062_102E516F7AC987B0"/>
the Righteouſneſs of CHRIST? and this the ſacred Scriptures aſſert to be by Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6. <hi>even as</hi> David <hi>deſcribeth the Bleſſedneſs of the Man, unto whom God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth Righteouſneſs without Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Antitheſis between CHRIST and <hi>Adam</hi> will not hold, if <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin be not imputed to us; for as the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is ſo imputed to Believers, that every one of them may ſay truly it is his own; and hence Chriſt is called by the Prophet, <hi>the Lord our Righteouſneſs;</hi> and is ſaid by the Apoſtle, to be <hi>made of God to us, Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification, and Redemption;</hi> ſo every Child of <hi>Adam</hi> may ſorrowfully ſay, reſpecting his Tranſgreſſion, that Iniquity is mine, and I am righteouſly puniſhed for it.</p>
            <p>NEITHER is there any Thing unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in the Doctrine of the Imputation of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin to his Poſterity, if it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that he had a Capacity to keep the Covenant made with him; and that the Conſequences of his doing ſo, which were equal to the Loſs that he and his Offspring ſuffered by his Fall, would have been as certainly conferred upon them, as if they were perſonally obedient.</p>
            <p>NAY, we may ſafely ſay, that <hi>Adam</hi>'s being conſtituted the foederal Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:008266_0063_102E51733658E720"/>
of his Poſterity, had a more probable Tendency to promote their Intereſt, than if every one of them had ſtood for himſelf perſonally and particularly; the Reaſon is this, <hi>Adam</hi> had not only as great a Capacity to ſtand, and was under as great Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to do ſo upon his own Account, as any other could for himſelf; even in this reſpect, the Caſes were equal, the Chances parallel, but beſides this, he had a very important Excitement to Obedience, as he was a public Repreſentative, which private Perſons could not have, <hi>viz.</hi> that of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the Salvation of his whole Offspring by his Standing, and on the Contrary, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving them in unſpeakable Ruin and Miſery, by his Fall.</p>
            <p>THIS Argument muſt be in reaſon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have conſiderable Influence upon a pious and generous Mind, a good Parent is full of Bowels towards his Offspring, and is apt to be tenderly moved with the Proſpect of their Happineſs or Miſery, and this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern is like to be proportioned, to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Duration of them, as well as to the Number or Extent of his Deſcendants, who are deeply intereſted in, and whoſe Fate is determined by thoſe different and contrary Events; the Conſideration of which tends to affect him in a great Degree,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:008266_0064_102E51774A041640"/>
unleſs his Mind be ignorant, and his Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions irregular, which cannot be ſuppoſed to be the Caſe of our firſt Parents, before the abuſe of their Liberty, without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting the expreſs Teſtimony of Scripture, reſpecting their original Integrity, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting, in Effect, that GOD himſelf is the Author of Sin; Conſequences abſurd and blaſphemous! Moſt certainly, upon the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis of a Covenant Tranſaction with <hi>Adam,</hi> the firſt Man, the Father of the human Species, for his whole Poſterity, his Conduct muſt be big with the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Conſequences, towards all the human Race! this Conſideration vaſtly turns the Balance in Favour of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Headſhip.</p>
            <p>WHAT the Apoſtle ſays of LEVI, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.9, 10. ſerves to illuſtrate the Point of Truth, which I am diſcourſing upon; it is ſaid in theſe Verſes, <hi>that</hi> Levi <hi>paid Tithes in, or by</hi> Abram, <hi>when</hi> Melchizedeck <hi>met him; while he was yet in the Loins of his Father;</hi> and ſo, much more, may the Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Adam</hi> be reckoned to have ſinned in him, ſeeing they were not only included in him, as Branches in the Root, and Members in the Head naturally, but were repreſented by him foederally, or in a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant Way.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:008266_0065_102E5178CCC38C30"/>IT ſhould be alſo obſerved, that when the Imputation of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin is denied, the principal Foundation of the Propagation of Sin is taken away, nor can any ſufficient Reaſon be given for the Propagation of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin to his Poſterity; I mean the Pollution of it, or, in other Words, Original Sin inherent, if the Caſe be ſo: For ſurely it is not only a Sin, but a Puniſhment, to want Original Righteouſneſs; now Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment neceſſarily ſuppoſes Sin, for the Guilt of which, divine Juſtice inflicts it only; but all have not ſinned actually in their own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as is evident from the Caſe of Infants, and yet all are puniſhed with the Loſs of God's Image, and therefore the Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> muſt be imputed to all his Poſterity; otherwiſe there is no accounting for the Juſtice of God, in ſuffering this Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which he could eaſily prevent; it will not remove the Difficulty to ſay, that God only ſuffers one corrupt Creature to beget another, according to the Law of Nature, as a Lepper begets a Lepper, ſeeing that the Almighty could hinder this Propagation of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, by creating them immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately as the Angels, and many other Ways which we know not; we have no reaſon to think that a righteous and good GOD would ſuffer it, to the Puniſhment of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:008266_0066_102E517B62BB3088"/>
who are ſuppoſed to be intirely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent.</p>
            <p>IF the Guilt of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin be not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, whence is it that Pollution ſhould be from thence tranſmitted to his Poſterity, rather than from the particular Sins of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Parents to their immediate Offspring? And ſeeing the Souls of Men are not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, but immediately created by God, whence is it that they are diſrobed of the Ornaments of Original Righteouſneſs at their Creation, if Original Sin be not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted?</p>
            <p>NOW that we are polluted from our Birth, with the Stain of Sin, the ſacred Scriptures poſitively declare, by aſſerting, that <hi>the Imagination of Man's Heart is evil from his Youth, (Gen.</hi> 8.21.) <hi>that Man is born like a wild Aſſes Colt (Job</hi> 11.12.) <hi>that none can bring a clean Thing, out of an unclean, not one (Job</hi> 14.4.) <hi>that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be clean, who is born of a Woman (Job</hi> 25.4.) <hi>that we are ſhapen in Iniquity, and conceived in Sin (Pſ.</hi> 51.5.) <hi>that he that is born of the Fleſh, is Fleſh (John</hi> 3.6.) <hi>and that the fleſhly Mind is Enmity againſt God;</hi> that before Converſion, all are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually <hi>blind</hi> and <hi>dead</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.1.) that there is a Neceſſity of being <hi>born again (John</hi> 3.3.) which ſuppoſes
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:008266_0067_102E517E2C82B6E0"/>
a Corruption in the firſt Birth, without which a Second would be needleſs; and that this new Birth is a <hi>Quickning of the Dead (Epheſ.</hi> 2.1.) and farther, that while we are in a State of Nature, we are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpiritual Strength, and without a Will to ſpiritual Good (<hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Job</hi> 5.40.) and indeed univerſal Experience proves this Point, the whole World is corrupt without ſo much as one Exception (<hi>Rom.</hi> 3.10, 11, 12.) <hi>nemo ſine crimine vivit.</hi>

            <p>FARTHER, how can the Death of Infants be reaſonably reconciled to the Juſtice of GOD, without acknowledging the Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Guilt to them; eſpecially if it be conſidered, that Death is repreſented by God himſelf, to be the Wages of Sin, and that it puts a Period to the Creature's Duration here.</p>
            <p>TO ſuppoſe that the Guilt of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, is only propagated by Imitation, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front the expreſs Teſtimony of ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which aſſures us that <hi>Death,</hi> and therefore the Sin that procured it, <hi>reigned over thoſe that had not ſinned after the Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of</hi> Adam<hi>'s Tranſgreſſion, (Rom.</hi> 5.14.) <hi>who was the Figure of him that was to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF Original Sin was only propagated by Imitation, then the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> would never have ſaid, that Sin entered the World by <hi>Adam,</hi> but by Satan, for he ſet the firſt Example of Sinning.</p>
            <p>MOREOVER it cannot, with any Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of reaſon, be thought that Baptiſm is adminiſtred to Infants, to blot out Sins of Imitation, for they have them not, and yet the Apoſtle calls it the <hi>Levour of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

               </note> Surely if there was no Stain, there would be no need of a Laver to waſh in; and here you may obſerve, that Infant Baptiſm is a ſtanding Teſtimony to the important Doctrine of Original Sin, and therefore of great Uſe in the Church of GOD.</p>
            <p>BUT it is objected againſt what has been ſaid, that <hi>the Son ſhall not bear the Iniquity of the Father, Ezek.</hi> 18.4, 20.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> THIS Paſſage of Scripture relates to the perſonal Sins of private Parents, which ſhould not be imputed to their Offspring, unleſs they followed their Footſteps, and not to the Sin of Nature, which all have ſinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> as our Text aſſerts.</p>
            <p>IT is likewiſe objected, that Children in Covenant are ſaid to be <hi>Holy, Humble,</hi> and that <hi>of ſuch is the Kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> WHATEVER good Properties any Children have, they have them not by Nature, but by Grace; for <hi>by Nature we are all Children of Wrath, even as others, Eph.</hi> 2.1, 3.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER Objection is drawn from theſe Places, <hi>viz. Rom.</hi> 5.18. <hi>as by the Offence of one, Judgment came upon all Men to Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, even ſo by the Righteouſneſs of one,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:008266_0070_102E5185454580A8"/>
the free Gift came upon all Men to Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Life;</hi> and elſewhere, CHRIST is ſaid to <hi>take away the Sin of the World</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22.) and we are farther aſſured, that <hi>as in</hi> Adam <hi>all die, ſo in</hi> CHRIST <hi>all ſhall be made alive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> THE firſt Place of Scripture, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by the following Verſe, thus, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>as by one Man's Diſobedience many were made Sinners, ſo by the Obedience of one, ſhall many be made Righteous;</hi> obſerve, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation is here repreſented as a paſt Fact, but the Juſtification as future, <hi>ſhall be made Righteous,</hi> i. e. when they believe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.20, 22, 23, 24. it is ſaid of <hi>Abram,</hi> that <hi>he ſtaggerd not at the Promiſe of God through Unbelief, but was ſtrong in Faith, giving Glory to God; and therefore it was imputed to him for Righteouſneſs; now it was not written for his ſake alone, that it was imputed to him; but for us alſo, to whom it ſhall be imputed, if we believe on him.</hi> The Apoſtle draws a Parallel between the firſt and ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> which holds good not only as to the Manner of conveying Death and Life to thoſe they repreſented, <hi>viz.</hi> by Imputation, but alſo as to the Extent of the Loſs and Benefit to their different Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprings: The ſeeming Difficulty is removed, by conſidering that <hi>Adam</hi> was a natural
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:008266_0071_102E518932DB5920"/>
Head of a natural Offspring, and Chriſt a ſpiritual Head of a ſpiritual Offspring; and hence the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>of the Earth earthly,</hi> and <hi>the ſecond</hi> Adam, <hi>the Lord from Heaven;</hi> now as <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin reached all his natural Offspring (i. e. all Mankind) ſo Chriſt's Righteouſneſs extends to all his ſpiritual Seed, <hi>viz.</hi> all that believe in him (or are regenerated) and we are aſſured by expreſs Teſtimony of Scripture, that the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt extends to the Juſtification of none elſe, <hi>John</hi> 3.18. for <hi>he that believes not, is condemned already.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AS to <hi>Chriſt's taking away the Sin of the World,</hi> we can underſtand that Place of Scripture, in Conſiſtency with other Places, and with the Dictates of right Reaſon, in no other Senſe but this, <hi>viz.</hi> that Chriſt takes away the Guilt of all Sin of every Kind, upon our believing in him, but not before: To ſuppoſe the Guilt of Original Sin is taken away, and that in the mean Time the Guilt of Actual remains, or that the Guilt of any Sin is removed without Faith, is antiſcriptural, abſurd, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of the whole Goſpel; for this ſignifies that Perſons receive ſaving Benefits by Chriſt, without a vital Union to him; and likewiſe that they are both juſtified and condemned at the ſame Time; the former of which is
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:008266_0072_102E518C0C6FC6E0"/>
falſe, and the latter impoſſible in the Nature of Things, ſee <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.6. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.36.</p>
            <p>AND pray obſerve, that the Words refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to, <hi>John</hi> 1.29. are in the preſent Tenſe, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away the Sin of the World, (ho airoon)</hi> JESUS CHRIST as the paſcal Lamb, a Type of him, to which this Paſſage alludes, expiates all the Sins of all that believe in him, of every Nation, whether <hi>Jewiſh</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi> by the Sacrifice of himſelf, or by transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their Guilt upon him, and ſuſtaining the Puniſhment due for them; which are here called Sin, in the ſingular Number, by an Analogy of Number, or Synecdche of a Part, to ſignify the Body of Sin and Death, containing all Kinds of Impiety, to atone for which the Lamb of God was ſlain (<hi>Rom.</hi> 6.12.7.24. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7.) the dear Redeemer takes away the Guilt of Sin, by the Merit of his Blood, and the Dominion of it, by the Power of his Spirit: <hi>He taketh away,</hi> obſerve it is a preſent Thing, a continued Act, which will never be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated till the End of Time; he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly taking away the Guilt and Power of every Sin from thoſe that believe, by the Interceſſion of his Blood in Heaven, and the Influence of his Grace on Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:008266_0073_102E518D90BF6E08"/>ONCE more, ſeeing the Place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the Objection, refers to the whole Efficacy of the Sacrifice of Chriſt, in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Sin, it will follow, that if it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricted to Original Sin only, then Chriſt's Satisfaction for Actual is denied, and if ſo, then Sinners muſt ſatisfy for them them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or periſh; but how they will pay an infinite Debt, who are but finite and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Creatures, I cannot conceive; they had beſt ſee to it that are immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, in the abſurd Hypotheſis I oppoſe, before it be too late! But to proceed,</p>
            <p>AS to that Place of Scripture in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians, viz. That as in</hi> Adam <hi>all die, ſo in Chriſt all ſhall be made alive,</hi> it evidently reſpects the Reſurrection of the Body at the laſt Day; it ſpeaks not of the Time preſent, nor ſays that they are made alive, but of the Time to come, and ſignifies that they ſhall be made alive; the Apoſtle in that Chapter, proves the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Dead, by the Argument of Chriſt's Reſurrection (this is the Scope of the Place) and ſhews particularly the Order in which the Dead ſhall be raiſed, <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>Firſt thoſe that belong to Chriſt, then cometh the End, when he ſhall have delivered up the Kingdom to the Father</hi> (i. e. in its preſent Form of Adminiſtration) and indeed to
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:008266_0074_102E519023B3FFD8"/>
ſuppoſe that all are ſpiritually alive, is to oppoſe the expreſs Teſtimony of Scripture, which declares the Unconverted to be dead in Sins and Treſpaſſes, and it likewiſe ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Converſion needleſs, becauſe on this Plan Men would be born converted, for what is Converſion but a Quickning of the Dead (as before obſerved) or the Infuſion of a Principle of ſpiritual Life into them? Surely if the firſt Birth was good, there would be no need of a Second, and thus the Wiſdom of God would have miſſed the Matter, in inculcating that important Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Maſter, who to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of himſelf and his Order, was groſly Ignorant of its Nature and Neceſſity! But I proceed,</p>
            <p>ANOTHER Objection is this, <hi>viz.</hi> that our Lord told his Diſciples, <hi>That neither the blind Man, or his Parents, had ſinned, but that the Works of God ſhould be made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in him (Joh.</hi> 9.23.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> THE Meaning of the Place, is no more than this, that the Almighty did not inflict that Diſorder of Blindneſs upon the Man, as a Puniſhment of any particular Evil committed by him, or his private Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; but chiefly with deſign to manifeſt his own Power in the Cure of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:008266_0075_102E5195315DE8B0"/>BUT it is farther objected, that the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Original Sin, is contrary to the Juſtice and Truth of GOD.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> IT is contrary to Juſtice, to puniſh him that has ſinned in no reſpect, either actually or virtually, but it is not unjuſt to puniſh thoſe that have ſinned virtually only, or in their Cauſe, as we have in <hi>Adam;</hi> the Caſe is certainly ſo, that GOD does puniſh for that Evil now; and from Fact we may argue to Right, reſpecting the Almighty; for ſurely he does nothing but what he has a Right to do; add to this, what has been ſaid before, concerning the reaſonableneſs of <hi>Adam</hi>'s being made a Repreſentative of his Poſterity, and the Objection vaniſhes.</p>
            <p>FARTHER, the Charge of Injuſtice may be with Advantage retorted upon our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents, who according to their Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, are obliged to acknowledge, that the Wages of Sin, <hi>viz.</hi> Death, are inflicted upon ſuch as are entirely innocent (<hi>viz.</hi> Infants) neither guilty of Original or Actual Sin; a Sentiment very harſh and ſevere, and manifeſtly contrary to the Dictates of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Maxims of Juſtice: Pray is it not more equitable to believe, that God puniſhes for ſome Sin, though it be Original, than for none at all? Whether it be modeſt and conſiſtent, for theſe Gentlemen to raiſe a
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:008266_0076_102E5196B70F9C90"/>
Hu-and-cry of Injuſtice, againſt their Neighbours Opinion, while they are ſo deep in the Dirt themſelves, is left to others to determine.</p>
            <p>NEITHER is it contrary to the Omnicience and Truth of GOD, to reckon him to have ſinned virtually, or interpretatively in his Cauſe, who has not ſinned actually in his own Perſon.</p>
            <p>IT is again objected, that the Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> does not exiſt, and therefore that it cannot be imputed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> ALTHOUGH it does not exiſt Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, yet it does exiſt Morally; though the Act of Sin be tranſient, yet the Guilt it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts is permanent, and cannot be removed but by the Application of Chriſt's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to the Soul.</p>
            <p>NEITHER is the following Objection of any Validity, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is unreaſonable that the Sin which was pardoned in <hi>Adam,</hi> ſhould be imputed to his Poſterity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> THOUGH <hi>Adam</hi> perſonated us in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, he did not do ſo in repenting and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, by which he obtained Remiſſion; for the State from which he fell, was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and therefore involved all, but the State to which he was reſtored was gracious, and ſupernatural, and therefore concerned his own Perſon only, and not his Poſterity;
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:008266_0077_102E51994CD9E2F0"/>
for though <hi>Adam</hi> was conſtituted the Head or Repreſentative of his Poſterity, in the Covenant of Nature or of Works; yet he was made no Head or Repreſentative of the Covenant of Grace, by which he was reſtored: No; this was the Place of the ſecond <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ANOTHER Objection againſt the labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Point is this, that it is not agreeable to the divine Perfections, for the Almighty to appoint <hi>Adam</hi> to be the Repreſentative of his Poſterity, without their Conſent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> SEEING the Plan of the firſt Covenant was in itſelf reaſonable, and more to our Advantage, than if every Man had ſtood for himſelf perſonally, as was obſerved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; there is no Foundation for the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, unleſs our Opponents ſay, that it is unjuſt for God to confer Benefits upon any without their Conſent, which is ridiculous and abſurd. So proper a Perſon as <hi>Adam,</hi> the common Father of all, and conſequently the moſt honourable (in the ordinary Way of Generation) of all the human Race, could not be found to repreſent his Poſterity, and therefore had all Mankind exiſted, it would have been both their Intereſt and Duty, to have choſe him for their Repreſentative.</p>
            <p>BESIDES it ſhould be conſidered, that the Benefit propoſed to <hi>Adam</hi> in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:008266_0078_102E519CF4BC03E8"/>
of Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> a Confirmation of his preſent State of Happineſs, was what he had no natural Right to, antecedent to the divine Will and Pleaſure; and therefore JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOVAH might without the Charge of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice ſuſpend the Grant of it, upon a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to be performed by him, his Failure in which, might cauſe a Forfeiture of the Benefit propoſed, both to him and his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants, who cannot be with reaſon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have a greater Right to it then he.</p>
            <p>AND although when our firſt Parents ſinned, we did not exiſt and conſent actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, yet we exiſted and conſented virtually in our Cauſe, Progenitor and foederal Head, in one <hi>Adam,</hi> as our Text aſſerts; <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as by one Man Sin entered into the World, and Death by Sin, and ſo Death paſſed upon all Men, for that all have ſinned:</hi> But our Opponents modeſtly give the Lye to the Apoſtle, and the Spirit with which he was inſpired, and ſay that all have not ſinned.</p>
            <p>I might add, that the Covenant of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or of Works, was not INTER PARES, AMONG EQUALS, but between the Almighty Creator, abſolute Proprietor and Sovereign Lord of all, and poor Worms of the Earth, who are but of Yeſterday, cruſhed before the Moth, and have no abiding; Creatures whoſe Goodneſs extends not to Immenſity
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:008266_0079_102E519FD4924FC8"/>
and Self-ſufficiency; and therefore it is the higheſt Inſolence for ſuch inſignificant Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who are as Nothing, and leſs than Nothing, and Vanity, to preſcribe to their Sovereign, and inſiſt upon the uſual For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities of human Covenants (among Equals) in tranſacting with the ſupream Being, who has abſolute Empire over them, and whoſe Beck they are bound by the ſtrongeſt Obligations inſtantly to obey; and therefore, inſtead of diſputing, they ſhould admire and revere the divine Condecenſion, in treating with ſuch Criminals, Inferiors, and Dependants, in a Way that reſembles a Covenant Tranſaction in any Thing, which is in very Deed, a prodigious Stoop of glorious Sovereignty, and condeſcending Majeſty!</p>
            <p>IT is not contrary, my Brethren, to the Law of Nature, or of Nations, for the Children of Traitors to ſuffer for their Crimes; or for the Iniquity of ſome public Perſons, to be puniſhed in many others; whole Cities and Countries have ſuffered on their Account: Was not the Sin of the <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lekites</hi> puniſhed in their Children, by the expreſs Order of God, ſome Hundreds of Years after it was committed? (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.2, 3.) for this a War was to be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt them, from Generation to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:008266_0080_102E51A159C92A70"/>
(<hi>Ex.</hi> 17.16.) The Inſtance of <hi>Achan</hi> is alſo remarkable, for his coveting the Wedge of Gold, he ſuffered not alone, but his Sons and Daughters were ſtoned and burned with Fire, together with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (<hi>Joſ.</hi> 7.24, 25.) to what has been ſaid, many Examples might be added, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Sons of <hi>Saul</hi> (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.) of <hi>Jereboam</hi> (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.9, 10.) of <hi>Ahab</hi> (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.21, 23) and others, and hence the Church mourns, <hi>Lam.</hi> 5.7. <hi>our Fathers have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and we have born their Iniquities;</hi> and our Lord himſelf threatens the <hi>Jews, Mat.</hi> 23.35. that upon them ſhould come all the righteous Blood ſhed upon the Earth, from <hi>Abel</hi> to <hi>Zecharias,</hi> and does not Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty GOD threaten in the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the moral Law, that <hi>he will viſit the Sins of the Fathers, upon the third and fourth Generation of thoſe that hate him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THOUGH none but the Guilty are puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their Parents Sins, yet inaſmuch as the Almighty takes <hi>Occaſion</hi> from their Sins to puniſh their Poſterity (in temporal reſpects) it plainly ſhews, that they are in ſome Sort imputed to them; and no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſeeing the Child is but as it were a Part of the Parent, cloathed in another Skin; and therefore the Almighty being the original Proprietor, and Lord of all,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:008266_0081_102E51A2DC248378"/>
may afflict the Tranſgreſſor in what Part of him he pleaſes.</p>
            <p>NOR is that Paſſage in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 18.20. to be underſtood abſolutely, that the Son ſhall not bear the Iniquity of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for ſo it would contradict the moral Law; but it ought to be underſtood:</p>
            <p n="1">1. OF adult Children, who forſake their Parents Sins, as appears from the 19th Verſe of the Chapter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IT reſpects perſonal and particular Sins, as was obſerved before, and not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and general, in reſpect of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter or Influence of the Criminals.</p>
            <p n="3">3. IT is not laid down as a general Rule of God's Providence and Juſtice, to which the Almighty did always conform his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in Time paſt, and was determined to do ſo conſtantly with all People in Time to come, no; we find it otherwiſe in the Sanction of the Law, and the Examples before mentioned; the Words therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a ſpecial Favour to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church and Nation, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Almighty would not deal with them according to the rigour of his Juſtice, which he might do, but in order to ſilence their Cavils againſt his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, he would only in Time coming puniſh them for their perſonal Iniquities; this ſeems to be the Series and Scope of the Context.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:008266_0082_102E51A683FFB268"/>BUT it is Time to proceed to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of what has been ſaid.</p>
            <p>IS the Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> imputed to us, let us then acknowledge God's Juſtice in this Matter, and humble ourſelves before him; how awful is the State we are born in, who are condemned as ſoon as born!

            <p>O Sinners! labour to be ſenſible of the awful Entail from our firſt Parents, and flee for Refuge to the Hope ſet before you, without the leaſt Delay, for ye know not what a Day may bring forth.</p>
            <p>THE ſure Way to get our Wounds not juſt ſkinned over, but effectually healed, is to have them ſearched and probed to the Bottom; the only Method to have the Balm of <hi>Gilead</hi> ſavingly applied, is to know and feel the Depth of our Diſeaſe, and that ſpeedily, without which, we will not be ſuitably humbled before God, nor with due

            <p>IT is an awful Proof of the Degeneracy of human Nature, a Confirmation of the Doctrine I have been diſcourſing upon, that many are ſo proud and vain as to deny it; they hereby imitate the wicked Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of our firſt Parents, who after their Apoſtacy, laboured to leſſen and excuſe their Impiety, by caſting the Blame upon others, and if that would not do, even upon God himſelf; <hi>The Serpent beguiled me,</hi> ſaid the Woman; <hi>the Woman that thou gaveſt me, gave me, and I did eat,</hi> ſaid the Man; as if he had ſaid, it is the Woman's Fault, not mine; but if that is not a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Apology, God gave me this Woman, and therefore he is the Author of my Sin and Miſery. O horrid, ungrateful Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my! Yea ſuch follow the Suggeſtions of Satan himſelf to our firſt Parents, in leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their Danger, <hi>ye ſhall not ſurely die;</hi> and act over again their fatal Folly, in liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to, and believing him: But <hi>though thou waſh thee with Nitre, and take thee much Soap, yet thine Iniquity is marked before me, ſaith the Lord God: How canſt thou ſay, I am not polluted?

            <p>A Deluge of the moſt abſurd Politheiſm and groſs Prophaneſs, overſpread the greateſt Part of the Infidel Tribes, before the Light
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:008266_0091_102DDD5D9B3B7F20"/>
of the Goſpel ſhone among them; no Object was ſo deſpicable, as not to be thought worthy of divine Honours; no Vice ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable, as not only to obtain in common Converſation, but even to be admitted into their religious Rights, and moſt ſolemn Acts of Worſhip; yea, to give Sanction to the moſt brutiſh and crimſon Iniquities, they aſcribed them to the Gods they adored, as learned ARNOBIUS obſerves, with equal Juſtice and Elegance.</p>
            <p>IT is true, the Corruption was not ſo univerſal, but that ſome noble Souls raiſed themſelves above the common Level, they bewailed and contemned the Stupidity and Credulity of the Multitude, yet their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was ſmall, and the Efficacy of their ſingular Sentiments even upon themſelves but little; the Effect of their Diſcernment was but a State of perpetual SCEPTICISM, a floating in doubtful Uncertainty between all Opinions, diſcarding what was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly Wrong, but not fixing their Minds in what was Good and Right.</p>
            <p>YEA, in Matters of moral Good and Evil, though ſome of the Rules they have left us are truly excellent, yet in many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Things they are very deficient; there is a deep Silence in their Writings of the Nature and Obliquity of ſeveral Vices,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:008266_0092_102E51C62ACD36E0"/>
ſuch as Pride, Revenge, and Self-murder, they are likewiſe ſilent about the right Principle of Action, Love to God; the right End of Action, the Glory of God; the right Mode of Action, Humility, and a Dependance upon God, for Light, Strength, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance.</p>
            <p>THEY were alſo at a Loſs reſpecting the Method of regaining the Friendſhip of the Almighty when offended, the Certainty of a future State, and the ſtrict Account they muſt render of all their Actions to the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Lord and Judge of the Univerſe; and are not theſe Things of inexpreſſible Importance, the very governing Principles of a Chriſtian's Conduct? This melancholy Ignorance of the <hi>Pagan</hi> Maſters, was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Source of that Uncertainty they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray in their Diſcourſes, and ſuch Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency in their Lives, concerning which, one of the greateſt and beſt Judges among them, <hi>viz.</hi> TULLY, ſpeaks thus, <q>Do you think, ſays he, that theſe Things, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Precepts of Morality, had any Influence upon thoſe Men (excepting only a very few) that thought, and wrote, and diſputed about them, no; who is there of all the Philoſophers, whoſe Mind and Manners were comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to right Reaſon, who ever made
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:008266_0093_102E51C7B2E86CC8"/>
his Philoſophy the Law and Rule of his Life, and not a meer Boaſt and Shew of his Wit and Parts? Who obſerved his own Inſtructions, and lived in Obedience to his own Precepts? On the contrary many of them were Slaves to filthy Luſts.</q>
            </p>
            <p>NAY even the Things which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves knew, they had not Authority enough to inculcate upon Mens Minds, with ſuch Impreſſion as to Influence and govern their Conduct; the Truths they proved by a Train of ſpeculative Reaſonings, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of more ſenſible Authority to enforce them with Energy in Practice; the Precepts they propoſed wanted Weight, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appeared to be no more than the Precepts of Men; this was doubtleſs the Reaſon that none of the Philoſophers were ever able to work any remarkable Change in the Minds and Lives of their Hearers; nor does it appear in Hiſtory that any of the Followers of SOCRATES, were ever ſo convinced by his Inſtructions of the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Virtue, and the Certainty and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of its final Reward, as to be willing to lay down their Lives for its Sake, as innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Diſciples of the Lord JESUS CHRIST have done, with the greateſt Gladneſs and heroic Fortitude.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="unknown:008266_0094_102E51C937C48510"/>THE Truth is, the Philoſophers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were ſenſible of the Defect of their own Rules in this particular, and therefore confeſs, that human Nature was ſtrangely corrupted, and that this Corruption was a Diſeaſe whoſe Cauſe they knew not, and for which they could not find a ſufficient Remedy: So that the great Duties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Virtue, were propoſed by them as Matters of <hi>Speculation,</hi> rather than Rules of <hi>Practice;</hi> not ſo much urged upon Mens Hearts and Lives, as propoſed to their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration.</p>
            <p>THIS was apparently the Condition of Mankind without a Revelation; to recover them out of which Degeneracy, into a State ſuitable to the original Excellency of their Nature, a ſupernatural Diſcovery of their Duty was plainly neceſſary; for if, as has been obſerved, the Generality of the World were ſo ignorant and corrupt, ſo over-run with Idolatry and Licenciouſneſs; if the beſt of the Philoſophers were not exempt from the general Infection, and far from Certainty reſpecting the Doctrines they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to advance; if the Points wherein they were certain, they were not able to prove clearly to vulgar Underſtandings, and thoſe they were able to prove, they had not ſufficient Authority to inforce;
<pb facs="unknown:008266_0095_102E51CD6A981168"/>
               <pb n="59" facs="unknown:008266_0096_102E51CABB93BD50"/>
in a Word, if there was ſo much Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency in themſelves, as to give Scandal to others, and ſo much Depravity in others, as to make them deſpair of reforming them, then was there plainly a want of ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation to ſupply theſe Defects, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover in what Manner and with what Kind of external Service the bleſſed God might be acceptably worſhipped; a Revelation to diſcover what Expiation he would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to accept of for Sin, by which his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is affronted and his Authority oppoſed; a Revelation to give intelligent Beings an Aſſurance of the great Motives of Religion, the Rewards and Puniſhments of a future State.</p>
            <p>IN fine, ſome particular Revelation was neceſſary, to make the whole Syſtem of Chriſtian Doctrine clear and obvious to all Capacities, to add Weight and Authority to the plaineſt Precepts, and to furniſh Men with extraordinary Aſſiſtance, to enable them to overcome the Corruptions of their Nature; and indeed without the Aſſiſtance of ſuch a Revelation, the wiſeſt of Men were always of Opinion, that the World could never be reformed; <q>Ye may even give over, ſays <hi>Socrates,</hi> all Hopes of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mens Manners for the future, unleſs GOD be pleaſed to ſend ſome other Perſon
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:008266_0097_102E52C91DD91918"/>
to inſtruct you! For whatſoever is ſet right, ſays <hi>Plato,</hi> in the preſent ill State of the World, can only be done by the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of GOD.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS condeſcending and gracious Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure, appears evidently in the Chriſtian Syſtem, the Plan of Salvation by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which though it be deſpiſed by the Ignorant, Inconſiderate, and Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced, is by thoſe that are awakened out of their Security, and divinely illuminated, experienced to be indeed and in Truth a glorious Diſplay of the <hi>Power</hi> of God, and the WISDOM of GOD; the latter of which let us for a little Space fix our Meditations upon at preſent.</p>
            <p>THE bleſſed God, my Brethren, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing Man's Fall, and the Miſery conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent upon it, determined his Recovery in a Way worthy of himſelf, and ſuited to the Circumſtances of the apoſtate Creature, in which his Wiſdom is eminently conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
            <p>THIS will appear by conſidering the END that God propoſed, and the MEANS he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed to compaſs it; all intelligent Agents firſt propoſe an End, and then chooſe the Means that tend to obtain it; now the more perfect the Underſtanding is, the more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:008266_0098_102DDD65AD45D800"/>
is the End it deſigns, and the more apt the Means it preſcribes to acquire it.</p>
            <p>THE END propoſed by the Goſpel of the Lord JESUS CHRIST is moſt excellent, <hi>viz.</hi> the GLORY of God, and the Happineſs of Mankind, or their Reſtoration to his Image and Favour.</p>
            <p>THE GLORY of GOD, or the Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Attributes, by their Exerciſe to the moral World, was his ſupream Scope; as God is the beſt of Beings, of Conſequence his Glory muſt be the beſt End, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is but reaſonable he ſhould aim at it in all his Works; and hence he is ſaid to have made all Things for himſelf, and that of him, and through him, and to him are all Things; ſeeing he is the Creator and Lord of all, it is but juſt and right that he ſhould be the End of all; nothing can be more natural than that what was borrowed from him, ſhould be directed to him, or his Honour; <hi>the Heavens</hi> are therefore ſaid to <hi>declare the Glory of God, and the Firmament to ſhew forth his Hand Work;</hi> on this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the Revelation of the Way to future Happineſs, by the dear, dear Lord JESUS CHRIST, is called, <hi>The glorious Goſpel of the bleſſed God;</hi> becauſe it is the cleareſt Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation, the richeſt Diſplay of the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendant Excellency of his adorable Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:008266_0099_102E51D25117E290"/>
which was ever given to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men; and hence <hi>Jehovah</hi> is ſaid to <hi>magnify his Word</hi> (i. e. the Word of his Grace) <hi>above all his Name:</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> aſſures us, that <hi>the Miniſtration of Righteouſneſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in Glory;</hi> and that under this Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, <hi>we all, with open Face, beholding as in a Glaſs the Glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame Image from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord:</hi> In the Goſpel we behold the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the harmonious Manifeſtation of the divine Attributes in the Scheme of Salvation through him, not under the dark Vail of Types, Shadows, and Propheſies, as the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, but with open Face as in a Glaſs, and are thereby gradually tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into his Image, through the Holy Spirit's concurring Influence.</p>
            <p>TO the aforeſaid Manifeſtation of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Attributes, which the Almighty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as his ſupream End, we muſt add the Praiſe and Thankſgiving of reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures on Account thereof; when intelligent Beings acknowledge the Diſplays of God's Excellencies with adoring Reverence, and ardent Affections, they glorify him; <hi>he that offereth praiſe, glorifieth me,</hi> ſaith the Almighty by the Pſalmiſt; and this undoubtedly the
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:008266_0100_102E51D3D3FC9B90"/>
bleſſed God had likewiſe in View as his ſupream End.</p>
            <p>BUT the ſubordinate End in Redemption, is the Reſtoration of Man; and this indeed is inſeparably connected with the former, as appears from the Angels Anthem, <hi>Glory to God on High, on Earth Peace, and good Will towards Men:</hi> Sin had broke the ſacred Alliance between God and Man, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him to the divine Diſpleaſure, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible and incomprehenſible Miſery; now what is more becoming the Father of Mercies, the God of Love, than to compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate and relieve the Miſerable; than to raiſe from the Depth of ruin many Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in which his Kindneſs and Benignity might for ever triumph!</p>
            <p>TO compaſs theſe truly valuable ENDS, divine Wiſdom projected the apteſt MEANS poſſible; which appears in the following eaſy Light.</p>
            <p>THE Miſery of apoſtate Man conſiſted in the Deprivation of his whole Nature by Sin, and in his Expoſedneſs to the divine Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure on the Account of it, which was a juſt and natural Conſequent of his crimſon Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy; and his Happineſs conſiſted in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring him to his original Purity and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with God, and to the full Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him; but the Way to effect this,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:008266_0101_102E51D556E052C0"/>
in Conſiſtency with the divine Juſtice, Law, and Government, was a Depth which no human Underſtanding could fathom.</p>
            <p>THAT God, whoſe being is LOVE, ſhould ſhew Kindneſs to the Angels, who never ſwerved from his Statutes, is eaſy to imagine; for though they cannot merit his Favour, yet they never incurred his Diſpleaſure by Maleconduct; and it muſt needs be natural to <hi>Jehovah,</hi> to Love the Image of his Purity wherever it appears.</p>
            <p>NOR is it hard to conceive, that the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty would be inclined to ſuccour an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Creature in Miſery; for in this Caſe, there would be nothing to obſtruct the free Efluxes of his unexhauſted Goodneſs; but how to ſave a Creature that is as guilty as miſerable by its own criminal Choice, is a Difficulty too hard to be ſolved by the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Men or Angels. Heaven itſelf ſeemed to be divided on this Occaſion. MERCY inclined to ſave, but JUSTICE in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed for Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>MERCY regarded Man with reſpect to his Miſery, and its Pleas were ſuch as theſe, ſhall the moſt excellent Creature in the lower World periſh, the Fault not being entirely his? periſh for ever, without any Favour! Shall no Compaſſion be ſhewn to miſerable Mankind, who in their original
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:008266_0102_102E51D802336678"/>
State, were the Beauty and Crown of all the numerous Ranks of Being in this infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Syſtem; ſhall the malignant Enemy for ever Triumph in the fatal Succeſs of his Perfidy, and reduce the whole human Race to the moſt deplorable and remedileſs Ruin? On the other Hand, JUSTICE, the Nature of which is, to give to every one his Due, conſidered Man as guilty of a moſt ungrateful, murderous, and pregnant Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; the Wages of which, agreeable to the Dictates of Reaſon, and the Law of God, is DEATH; this divine Attribute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates againſt ſhewing any Favour to the unhappy Delinquents; and queries, <hi>ſhall not the Judge of all the Earth do Right?</hi> All the other Attributes ſeemed to be At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants on Juſtice.</p>
            <p>THE WISDOM of GOD enforced its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lea; it being moſt indecent, that Sin, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits the Execution, ſhould procure the Abrogation of the Law; which would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Commiſſion of it, without Fear.</p>
            <p>THE MAJESTY of GOD was likewiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; for it was not becoming excellent Greatneſs and abſolute Sovereignty, to treat in this humble Manner with Inferiors and Delinquents, and to offer Pardon to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, ungrateful Rebels, before they

            <p>THE HOLINESS of GOD confirms and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborates the Plea of incenſed, leſed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and urges Juſtice to execute the Threatning annexed to the Violation of the Law; for <hi>Jehovah is of purer Eyes, than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Iniquity:</hi> As Purity is the eſſential Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his complacential Will, which he Loves immutably where ever it is, ſo by the Law of Contraries, Sin is the eternal Object of his Hatred; and conſequently ſuch as are (with their full Conſent) under its habitual Rule and Government, becauſe of their Connection with it, <hi>he will not,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job, take the wicked by the Hand, or at all acquit them,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Nahum</hi> expreſſes it: Purity and Pollution, by reaſon of their contrary Natures, cannot mix or coaleſs, but muſt maintain a perpetual Jar and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, till one or other is deſtroyed. Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, SIRS,</p>
            <p>THE TRUTH of GOD being plighted in the Covenant of Works, ſtands engaged to ſee to the Execution of the Penalty denounced in Caſe of Treſpaſs; and if it is not, the Matter ſo requiring, divine Truth fails; but that is impoſſible, and therefore this Attribute joins iſſue in the Conteſt with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice, Wiſdom, Majeſty, and Purity,
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:008266_0104_102E51DE41723188"/>
and requires the Execution of the threatned Puniſhment upon the Offender himſelf, or if extraordinarily diſpenſed with (in this reſpect) it muſt be on ſuch Terms, as the Honour of God's Truth may be preſerved inviolate.</p>
            <p>THIS ſeeming Conflict among the divine Attributes, no created Underſtanding could adjuſt, and find out a Way to reconcile infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Mercy with inflexible Juſtice; a Way to ſatisfy the Demands of the one, and grant the Requeſts of the other: In this Exigency divine WISDOM interpoſed, and in its unſearchable Depths deviſed an EX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PEDIENT, to ſave Man without any Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to the Perfections of the Deity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Injury to his Government over the moral World, by conſtituting a Mediator between the guilty Creature and himſelf, that by transferring the Puniſhment on the Surety, Sin might be puniſhed, and the Sinner ſaved; here MERCY and JUSTICE <hi>ſalute each other,</hi> and ſhine with equal Glory and Luſtre; the latter is fully ſatisfied, and the former exceedingly magnified! Theſe amiable Attributes in this mediatorial Plan, join in friendly Harmony, to promote and ſecure the penitent and believing Sinners perpetual Happineſs!</p>

               <pb n="68" facs="unknown:008266_0105_102E51E111554568"/>NOR is it unbecoming the MAJESTY of God, to accept a returning Sinner, when a Mediator of infinite Dignity interceeds for him.</p>
            <p>THE PURITY of the Almighty, is not in the leaſt Degree diſparaged by his Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency to Tranſgreſſors, ſeeing the bleſſed Mediator is a Principle and Pattern of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, to all that believe in him, and the TRUTH of God engaged to iſſue the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the broken Law, is by the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Sinners Surety preſerved invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late: So that all the divine Perfections con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur herein, and expreſs, to the eternal Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment and Delight of Men and Angels, inexpreſſible Charms, Beauty, and Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence!</p>

Scheme of Salvation by a Redeemer that can comprehend it!</p>
            <p>THE ANGELS, thoſe great Miniſters that attend the Throne of God, ſtoop down with the deepeſt Attention, the ſtrongeſt Deſire, and nobleſt Pleaſure, to behold the rich and unſearchable Variety of manifold Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and glorious Grace that is herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained! But though we cannot comprehend the Depths of redeeming Goodneſs, yet we may apprehend ſo much as to be thereby powerfully influenced to Admiration, Love, and Obedience! ſo much as to be thereby excited to cry out in the Apoſtle's Language, <hi>O the Depth of the Riches, both of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Wiſdom of God, how unſearchable are his Judgments, and his Ways paſt finding out!</hi> Surely <hi>the Love of Chriſt paſſeth Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge!</hi> But more particularly, dear SIRS,</p>
            <p>THE WISDOM of GOD appears eminently, in taking Occaſion from the Sin of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitor, to bring a greater Tribute of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to God, and greater Benefit to Man, than if he had never tranſgreſſed; Sin na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally tends to God's Diſhonour, and to the Creature's Ruin; but contrary to its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Tendency, it is over ruled by a wiſe Providence, to be the Occaſion of the greateſt glory to God, and good to Man; ſo that <hi>out of the Eater, comes forth Meat,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:008266_0107_102E51E875D6FD50"/>
and out of the Strong, Sweetneſs;</hi> as a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine is extracted out of Poiſon by the Alembick; or, as the black Ground in a Picture, though in itſelf it contuminates, yet when fixed, with Judgment, in its proper Place as a Shade, heightens the Luſtre of the brighter Colours, and adds to the Beauty of the whole Piece!</p>
            <p>DEAR SIRS, the Glory of God, is more illuſtriouſly apparent, in the recovery of fallen Man, than if he had never ſinned; had <hi>Adam</hi> perſevered inviolably in his Duty and Allegiance to his great Creator and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, he could only have been the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of divine Goodneſs, but not in its higheſt and moſt endearing Acts, which are to pity and ſuccour the Guilty and Miſerable; had he tranſgreſſed, and Redemption not have taken Place, Juſtice it is true would have been honoured with a ſolemn Sacrifice, a ſolemn Triumph! But Mercy, that amiable, benign, and indulgent Attribute, would have been vailed with a total Eclipſe! But now the Wiſdom of <hi>Jehovah</hi> in the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Man appears, by according theſe Attributes, and making them ſhine with rival Charms! The Honour of <hi>Jehovah</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears as much in preſerving the Authority of his Law, by puniſhing our Surety in our

room and Place, as by the Exerciſe of his Mercy in pardoning the Tranſgreſſor!</p>
            <p>NOR is it leſs honourable, my Brethren, to the divine Wiſdom, to reſtore fallen Man with infinite Advantage; though innocent Man was holy, yet ſad Experience verifies, that he was mutably ſo; but Holineſs in the redeemed ſhall be perpetual, eternal: <hi>Adam</hi>'s Stock was in his own Hand, and hence he became a Bankrupt, but ours is in the Hands of an Almighty Surety, who has undertaken for us, and will be faithful to his Truſt: Juſtice itſelf being ſatisfied, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes our Friend, and aſcertains our Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Paradice: I might add, that there are Graces to be acted by us in our fallen State, for which there were no Objects or Occaſions in Innocence; ſuch as Compaſſion to the Miſerable, Forgiveneſs of Injuries, and Patience; all which being Emblems of the divine Perfections, muſt of Conſequence be ornamental to, and perfective of our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls, in conforming them to the great Pattern and Original of Beauty and Excellency.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, the Wiſdom of God appears, in appointing ſuch a MEDIATOR as is ſuitably qualified to reconcile God to Man, and Man to God: A Mediator that is God and Man in one Perſon, and therefore capable of the
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:008266_0109_102E51ECEDCA0FA8"/>
Affections and Sentiments of both the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to be reconciled: The Wiſdom of the divine Conſtitution in appointing a Perſon to mediate, who is poſſeſſed of the divine and human Natures, appears more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly from the three Offices he exerciſes in that Character, <hi>viz.</hi> Prophetical, Prieſtly, and Kingly.</p>
            <p>CONSIDERED as a PROPHET, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that the MEDIATOR ſhould be GOD, that he might deliver Inſtructions with more Authority and Efficacy; it is God alone that can enlighten the Mind, convince the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, teach and change the Heart!</p>
            <p>AND it was likewiſe neceſſary, SIRS, that he ſhould be MAN, that he might converſe with us, and convey his Inſtructions to us, in ſuch a familiar Way as we could receive; ſuch is the Weakneſs of our preſent Frame, that the Majeſty of God's Appearance, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions a diſtreſſing Pannic, and hence, when <hi>Iſrael</hi> had ſeen ſome Glimpſes of God's Glory and Majeſty, at the giving of the Law, they beſought the Lord to ſpeak no more to them in ſuch a Manner, leſt they died: And, no Doubt, Guilt increaſes our Dread at the Approach of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore renders us unfit to attend with due Calmneſs to his immediate Inſtructions: An Inſtance of which we have in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:008266_0110_102E51F09D276CB8"/>
who when he heard the Seraphs ſhout, <hi>Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of Hoſts, the Heavens and Earth are full of the Majeſty of his Glory,</hi> lamented in this mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Language, <hi>wo is me, I am undone, for mine Eyes have ſeen the King, the Lord of Hoſts!</hi> Infinite Purity, attended with awful Majeſty, ſo alarms our Fears, as to render us unfit for Inſtruction; but the Son of God appearing in our Nature to make Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Tranſgreſſors, the Brightneſs of his divine Majeſty being vailed with the Mantle of his Humanity, is thereby allayed, and ſo more accommodated to our preſent State of Weakneſs; hereby we are encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to draw near to him, and to hear with Compoſure his gentle Inſtructions, which drop as the Rain, and diſtil as the Dew upon the tender Herb.</p>
            <p>NOR was the UNION of the divine and human Natures, in the Perſon of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, leſs neceſſary, my Brethren, in reſpect of his PRIESTLY OFFICE; he muſt be Man, that the ſinning Nature might ſuffer, and thereby acquire a right to the Satisfaction made; for our Title to the Benefits of Chriſt's Sufferings depends upon our Union to him, which is not only ſpiritual by Faith, but natural alſo; for as the Apoſtle obſerves, <hi>he who ſanctifies, and they who are ſanctified,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:008266_0111_102E51F441BBC960"/>
are all one;</hi> i. e. they have Communion in the ſame Nature: Inaſmuch as Suffering according to the divine Declaration was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to attone for Sin, of which the Deity is incapable, it behoved our High-Prieſt to be MAN, that he might have a Capacity for it; and that thoſe Sufferings might be of ſufficient Dignity and Value, and the human Nature ſupported under them, it was as neceſſary he ſhould be GOD.</p>
            <p>NOR was it leſs needful, Sirs, that the MEDIATOR ſhould partake of both Natures, in order to interceed for us as a PRIEST; that ſo he might have a ſufficient Intereſt in his Father's Affection, to prevail in his Suits for us, and at the ſame Time, be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of tender Affections towards us; being the Son of God, <hi>him the Father always hears,</hi> and being the Son of Man, <hi>he is touched with the Feeling of our Infirmities;</hi> we have therefore Encouragement <hi>to come with Boldneſs to the Throne of his Grace, to obtain Mercy, and find Grace to help in Time of Need!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND is it not alſo requiſite, that the MEDIATOR ſhould be GOD and MAN, in regard of his KINGLY OFFICE? For unleſs he be God, how can he apply the Fruits of his Death to us, diſpoſeſs the ſtrong Man armed, and ſubdue us to the Obedience of Faith?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="unknown:008266_0112_102E51F5C5DDFBD0"/>AND if he had not been Man, how could he have led us into the Way of univerſal Holineſs, by the Influence of his own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, which is doubtleſs an excellent Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to reform Mankind? It is not only ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to enact Rules of Virtue by a kingly Authority, but likewiſe by Example to make Precepts practicable and honourable; when brave Generals, though of the nobleſt Line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, deſign to animate their Armies to he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roic Atchievements, they voluntarily ſubmit their Perſons to all the humble Offices and Hardſhips of a State of War; courageouſly lead their Troops into the high Places of the Field of Battle, and expoſe their Lives to the greateſt Perils! This our Lord has done for us, the <hi>Captain of our Salvation,</hi> the King of the Church, and Lord of the Univerſe, <hi>has been made perfect through Sufferings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ANOTHER Inſtance, Sirs, of divine WIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOM in the Redemption of Man, by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, is in making the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to have ſome Analogy and Proportion to the Cauſe of our Ruin, i. e. as we fell in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> conſidered as our Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative, ſo we are raiſed by the Second, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in the ſame Character; <hi>as by the Diſobedience of one, many were made Sinners, ſo by the Obedience of one, many are made
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:008266_0113_102E51F8619653E0"/>
Righteous;</hi> as Guilt and Death came by the firſt, through IMPUTATION to all his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Offspring, that are united to him na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally by Exiſtence, ſo Righteouſneſs and Life come by the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> through IMPUTATION, to all his ſpiritual Offspring, that are united to him ſpiritually by Faith.</p>
            <p>MOREOVER, my Brethren, divine WIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOM is conſpicuous in the MANNER where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our Redemption is accompliſhed, <hi>viz.</hi> by the HUMILIATION of the SON of GOD; by this <hi>Jehovah</hi> as it were counter works the Sin of Angels and Men. PRIDE is the Malignity of every Sin, for by it the Sinner ſets up his Will above God; now that our dear Redeemer might cure the Diſeaſe (we labour under) in its original Source, by the Nature of the Remedy, applied to our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance Humility: Man who is but a Worm, and cruſhed before the Moth, was vainly and wickedly guilty of High-Treaſon, in affecting to be like God; and thus he fell from the State of Happineſs in which he was at firſt created! And the eternal Son of God, who was in the Form of God, and counted it not robbery to be equal with him, ſtooped to aſſume the humble Form of a Servant, that by his Sufferings he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore fallen Man to his primitive Purity and Bliſs; and by his Example correct that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:008266_0114_102E51FAF7CFFAA8"/>
which was the Fountain of his fatal Apoſtacy, and all its unhappy Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences! <hi>The Word was made Fleſh,</hi> to ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh the Diſtance between God and it; O ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendous Abaſement! the Condeſcenſion of divine Majeſty herein, is equal to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of divine Wiſdom; both are indeed incomprehenſible, both inexpreſſible! So dreadful was the Malignity of our native Arrogance, that ſuch unparallelled, aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Abaſement, even of God himſelf, was neceſſary to its Cure; by this our Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the firſt Work of our grand Enemy!</p>
            <p>FARTHER, Sirs, the WISDOM of God (in Connection with Almightineſs) appears, in appointing ſuch contemptible, and to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance contrary MEANS, to accompliſh ſuch great and glorious Effects; the Way is as wonderful as the Work; that Chriſt by dying on the Croſs a reputed Malefactor, ſhould be made our eternal Righteouſneſs; that by Death he ſhould deſtroy him that had the Power of Death, and purchaſe our Life; that by deſcending into the Grave, he ſhould purchaſe our Reſurrection from it, and immortal Bleſſedneſs, is trury amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and plainly ſhews that the Thoughts and Ways of God are far above ours, as the Heavens are above the Earth; ſtrange that immortal Life ſhould ſpring from

Death, Honour from Ignominy, Healing from Stripes, Bleſſedneſs from a Curſe! this is ſo Contrary to the uſual Courſe of Things, that to render it credible, it was typified by many Symbols, and foretold by many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets before it came to paſs, that when it came, it might be eſteemed an Effect of God's eternal Council, almighty Power, and unſearchable Wiſdom: Though <hi>Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified be to the</hi> Jews <hi>a ſtumbling Block, and to the</hi> Greeks <hi>Fooliſhneſs, yet to thoſe that are called, he is the Power of God, and the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God!</hi> Surely, <hi>great is the Myſtery of Godlineſs, God made manifeſt in the Fleſh;</hi> whatever our modern Exalters of carnal Reaſon, and Monopolizers of Wiſdom, mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Contrary notwithſtanding; theſe Men ſay they are Chriſtians, and yet with a Shew of Wiſdom, and Pretext of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to Jeſus Chriſt, they preſume to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front the expreſs Teſtimony of his inſpired Apoſtles, they labour with Art and Addreſs to rob his Religion of its GRAND PECULIARS, and to ſubſtitute poliſhed PAGANISM in its Place, and would have us to believe the JEST, the JUGGLE, that there is no mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Difference between them; but God forbid, we have not ſo learned Chriſt; while they profeſs themſelves to be wiſe, they commence Fools, they become vain in
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:008266_0116_102E5201E257ABF8"/>
their Imaginations, and their fooliſh Hearts are darkned; <hi>for in the Wiſdom of God, the World by Wiſdom knew not God, it pleaſed God by the Fooliſhneſs of Preaching, to ſave thoſe that believe,</hi> i. e. the great Sovereign and Lord of all, who has a right to do with his own as he pleaſes, has of his meer Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo ordered the Matter, that by the humble Preaching of the Croſs of Chriſt, or in other Words, the MEDIATORIAL PLAN of Salvation, by the Sufferings and Death of the Son of God (which ſome ſtumble at, and reckon inconſiſtent and fooliſh) thoſe that believe ſhall obtain eternal Happineſs. Such who reckon the grand Peculiars of the Religion of JESUS fooliſh and abſurd, would act a more candid and conſiſtent Part, if they renounced the Name of Chriſtianity altogether (for what ſignifies the Name without the Thing) and openly declared, that they reject the Bible, as a ſure and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Guide to Heaven, and betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their DAGONS, <hi>viz.</hi> their CARNAL REASON, and GRACELESS VIRTUE, to a Dependance on the former as their ſupream and ſufficient Guide, in the Matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and on the latter as their only Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; <hi>my Soul come not into their Secret, mine Honour be thou not united!</hi> Let <hi>Jewiſh, Grecian,</hi> and <hi>Britiſh</hi> INFIDELS or PAGANS

(the moſt inexcuſable of all the reſt, who in the Midſt of Light and Day grope in <hi>Egyptian</hi> Darkneſs) who in the Pride and Stoutneſs of their Hearts, deride and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſque the myſterious and humble Doctrines of Chriſt crucified, as a nonſenſial Scheme; yet they never will be able by all their Art, their Eloquence, and ſovereign Contempt, to drive thoſe that have experienced a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Change (a divine Birth) from the Foundation of their Hope; no, ſuch have an inward Witneſs, that <hi>Chriſt crucified is the Wiſdom of God,</hi> and the Power of God; and in every ſucceſſive Period, till Time concludes its Drama, there will be ſuch, who ſhall not be aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt, but glory in his Croſs, as a Badge of Honour; for <hi>the Foundation of God ſtands ſure,</hi> JEHOVAH has graciouſly promiſed, <hi>that the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt his Church,</hi> and that <hi>no Weapon formed againſt her ſhall proſper!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT to proceed; the divine WISDOM, my Brethren, appears gloriouſly in forming the PLAN of the GOSPEL, in ſuch a Manner as at once to provide for the COMFORT of Mens SOULS, and promote the PURITY of their MANNERS; and this indeed is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable Character of divine Doctrines, that they equally tend to promote God's
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:008266_0118_102E520713D27680"/>
Glory and our Benefit; thus as the Way to Bleſſedneſs by a Mediator, effectually ſecures God's Honour, ſo it powerfully incites the Sinner's Hope, Love, and Joy; by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the bleſſed God as amiable, benign, and gracious, by providing a compleat Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to injured Juſtice, that thus a Way might be opened, for a liberal, conſiſtent, and honourable Effuſion of divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in all its innumerable Inſtances, in all its various and valuable Effects, adapted to every changing Scene of Life, adapted to every Circumſtance of the Indigent and Diſtreſſed; and ſufficient to ſupport, relieve, yea, refreſh and content them, in the Midſt of Miſeries and Woes; and under a Train and Complication of the greateſt Calamities, which this Bockim, this State of Exile af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords! Theſe primitive and faithful Servants of Chriſt, the Apoſtles, though they were by many reckoned <hi>Deceivers,</hi> yet they were <hi>true, though they had Nothing, yet they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed all Things,</hi> though they <hi>were Sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet they were always Rejoicing!</hi> the MEDIATORIAL PLAN ſhews us how GOD <hi>may be</hi> JUST, <hi>and yet the</hi> JUSTIFIER <hi>of</hi> HIM THAT BELIEVES IN JESUS, becauſe of his PROPITIATION. This opens to our View, the unſpeakable Gift of the Son of GOD, and aſſures us of the Gift of all Things
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:008266_0119_102E520AB7A719D0"/>
with him in Caſe we believe; in particular, this fixes our final Perſeverance in Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a crowning Mercy, upon the impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable BASIS of the immutable PURPOSE, the Almighty POWER, and faithful PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MISE of GOD; upon the ſacred SURETY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SHIP, the compleat SATISFACTION, and perpetual INTERCESSION of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and therefore this Goſpel Scheme of Grace and Salvation, opens an unfailing Spring of Joy, and lays a firm Foundation for our Hope and Truſt; this calms the guilty, reſtleſs Mind, and makes it <hi>rejoice in the Hope of the Glory of God, with Joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable and full of Glory!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND as the Goſpel of Chriſt provides for our SOLACE, ſo it incites to univerſal PU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RITY; do not the Sufferings of the Son of GOD for Sin, give us a dreadful Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of its Malignity and Danger; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing leſs could make Satisfaction for it, and therefore ſerve to deter us from it? We may judge of the Danger of a Diſeaſe, by the Difficulty of its Cure; nothing leſs could heal our mortal Malady than the Blood of God; and ſeeing Chriſt has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed ſuch amazing Love to us, does not this tend to beget Love in us to him, and ſo conſtrain us to a voluntary, ſincere, and
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:008266_0120_102E520C73742268"/>
uniform Obedience, from that truly noble Principle?</p>
            <p>NOW if the Goſpel of Chriſt be ſuch as has been deſcribed, with what Ardour ſhould we celebrate the divine Praiſes, for this Revelation, ſo worthy of God, ſo ſuited to the Caſe of fallen Man? The Apoſtacy of our firſt Parents was ſo fatal to us, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than infinite Wiſdom could find out a ſufficient Remedy!</p>
            <p>THERE is no Diſcovery of this in the Works of Creation, the Heavens and Earth do indeed prove the Exiſtence of a Supream Being, by pointing to ſome of his adorable Attributes; but cannot repreſent the Deſign of Redemption, which has no Connection with the Exiſtence of Creatures, but hangs altogether upon the Sovereign Pleaſure of God; the Doctrine of the Trinity, which is the Foundation of the Mediatorial Plan of Salvation, cannot be known by the Frame of the Univerſe.</p>

Anarchy, the rudeſt Chaos, and become an ACELDEMA; though Miſery when felt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites to look out for a Remedy, yet here Reaſon is at a Loſs, at a Plunge, and quite non-pluſs'd: How could the <hi>Izraelites</hi> imagine, that by looking to the Brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, thoſe that were ſtung ſhould be heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? and how can a poor Creature diſcover, by the meer Dint of his own Genius, or Light within, the Satisfaction of divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice by Jeſus Chriſt? No, they cannot! and hence it is called a <hi>Myſtery hid from Ages and Generations;</hi> nay, though the human Mind had never been corrupted, it could not by the Force of its Reaſonings find it out; for this the very ANGELS could not diſcover, till it was made known to them by the CHURCH; by the firſt coming of Chriſt, and the Converſion of many to him, the Depths of divine Wiſdom were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed.</p>

Surely, by Nature we are as blind, corrupt, and perverſe as any other Nation, what are we then, that God ſhould be ſo gracious to us?

               <pb n="87" facs="unknown:008266_0124_102E521710DE3CC0"/>CAN this Principle be eaſily juſtified, that there is Something in all Mankind which, if attended to, is ſufficient to direct Men to Salvation without the Scriptures? It is no Matter what this Something be called, whether REASON, CONSCIENCE, or the LIGHT WITHIN, ſeeing the Subſtance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended is the ſame.</p>
            <p>DO not the Scriptures poſitively declare, that <hi>there is no Name given under Heaven, by which Salvation can be obtained, but the Name of Jeſus;</hi> that <hi>Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God,</hi> that <hi>we cannot hear without a Preacher,</hi> that the <hi>Heathens are Darkneſs, without the Covenants of Promiſe, without God,</hi> that <hi>they periſh for Lack of Viſion,</hi> and that all the Unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate before Conviction are <hi>blind, dead, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with Satan,</hi> that the <hi>Light</hi> in ſome is <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> and that <hi>all Men have not Faith;</hi> now how can the aforeſaid Principle agree with thoſe Declarations?</p>
            <p>AND do not Millions of Facts (which are ſtubborn Things) in the <hi>Pagan</hi> World, in the preſent and paſt Ages, and in various Nations, confirm the aforeſaid Teſtimony of Scripture? That the PAGANS, whatever Pains they take in their different Ways of Religion (unleſs they obtain ſome Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

from the ſacred Scriptures) remain ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the Way of Salvation by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>IF the PAGANS had this Knowledge, is it reaſonable to think that they would be brought to the Profeſſion of what they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve with great Difficulty, in Places where this Profeſſion is not attended with any Danger? and yet this has often been the Caſe, and is ſo ſtill; and why have ſo many oppoſed with great Vehemence, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Senſe of Guilt, the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity (with <hi>Saul</hi> before his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) if it be ſo univerſally known as is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed? And why do none, among ſuch vaſt Multitudes, and during ſo many Ages, give any Account of this Matter?</p>
            <p>FARTHER, is not one <hi>Deſign</hi> of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cred <hi>Scriptures,</hi> for <hi>Doctrine</hi> and Inſtruction, <hi>to make the Man of God perfect, and throughly furniſhed to every good Work;</hi> now what need is there of this, if there be ſufficient Light in every Man to direct him without it? is it not abſurd to ſay, we need more than what is ſufficient, or that we need more than we need! is not the BIBLE there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore needleſs and ſuperfluous, according to this Principle, and is this Principle ſafe, that in its Conſequences deprives us of our BIBLE?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="unknown:008266_0126_102E521E59455858"/>PRAY is it not the Buſineſs of <hi>Paſtors after God's Heart, to feed the People with Knowledge and Underſtanding?</hi> and is it not the Deſign of their Office to turn Sinners from Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Light? But what need is there of this Inſtitution at all, what need of any Labours to inſtruct Mankind, if Men have ſufficient Light without it in themſelves? Is not Preaching at any Time or Place, on this Plan, an Abſurdity, a meer Farce? And why did the Apoſtles take ſo much Pains in traveling and preaching? why did they run ſuch Riſques, and endure ſuch Hardſhips? was it to do a ſuperfluous Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to teach People what they knew al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, or might know without their Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance? if ſo, was this prudent in them (ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they carried on no Buſineſs of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize or Traffick in their Travels to enrich themſelves) or a good Argument that they had the full Exerciſe of their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? pray did they ſuffer Stripes, Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, or Death, like wiſe Men, or Fools, for doing what was needleſs, judge ye.</p>
            <p>UPON this Hypotheſis, is it probable, that we ſhall be duly ſenſible of the Value of our religious Privileges, ſincerely thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for them, tenderly concerned for thoſe that want them, and uſe Diligence to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelite

them to Chriſtianity, when we judge that they are unneceſſary.</p>
            <p>BUT to proceed, is not the incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible Myſtery of redeeming Wiſdom and Grace, well worthy of our ſerious Thoughts and Study; ſeeing it excels all other Sciences in the Sublimity of its Object, the Certainty of its Principle, the Efficacy of its Influence, and the Value of its End?</p>
            <p>IT is a Doctrine that affects the Soul, with the higheſt Admiration of the divine Wiſdom, Grace, and Love; and makes us ſpeak in the Pſalmiſt's Language, <hi>how won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful are thy Thoughts to us-ward?</hi> when the Almighty hereby <hi>turns our Captivity, we are as thoſe that dream;</hi> this opens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us the grandeſt Theme, that was ever expoſed to mortal Eye, or Ear; a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Wonders, the chief of all the Ways of God; ſtrange that he who fills Heaven and Earth, ſhould be confined in a Virgin's Womb, that Life ſhould die, and being dead, revive! that Mercy ſhould tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, without infringing on the Rights of Juſtice!</p>
            <p>THE Principle of this myſterious Doctrine is immutable, like God the Author and Object of it; whereas philoſophical Sciences are frequently ſhifting, almoſt every one, through Pride and exceſſive Self-love, is

diſpoſed to deſpiſe and pull down what ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with much Labour builds up.</p>
            <p>AND how precious and powerful is the Influence of this Doctrine, upon thoſe that believingly receive it? <hi>while they behold as in a Glaſs the Glory of the Lord, they are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into the ſame Image, from Glory to Glory; this is eternal Life to know God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom he has ſent:</hi> O let us cry earneſtly to God, that Chriſt crucified, may be more and more the Wiſdom of God, and the Power of God to us. <hi>Amen, Amen;</hi> dear Lord JESUS CHRIST, ſay, AMEN.</p>

above all other Perſons and Things, ſhall find an Intereſt in my Favour and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
            <p>IT is only the firſt Part of the Text, that I purpoſe now to diſcourſe upon, <hi>I love them that love me:</hi> Here let us enquire, what LOVE to the Lord JESUS CHRIST ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes and implies, and how the bleſſed JESUS loves ſuch, who love him?</p>
            <p>NOW <hi>Love</hi> to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>ſuppoſes;</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. THE KNOWLEDGE of our want of Love to him, our <hi>Enmity</hi> againſt him, and <hi>Inability</hi> to love him? For the Diſeaſe muſt be known and felt, before it be cured.</p>
            <p n="2">2. An affecting <hi>Diſcovery</hi> of his <hi>Amiable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>Excellency,</hi> which are the proper Objects and Incentives of rational Love. And,</p>
            <p n="3">3. IT ſuppoſes FAITH in him, for Love is the Fruit of Faith, by which it works (<hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6.) Now FAITH is the ſenſible, Sin-ſick Sinners, deliberate and unreſerved Conſent to embrace Chriſt, as the free Gift of God to periſhing Mankind, as its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, Prieſt, and King, under an Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of its abſolute Need of him in thoſe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and with an entire Dependence upon him for all needful Relief by them; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a full and firm Purpoſe of Heart to cleave to him, to deny itſelf, to take up

his Croſs and follow him (<hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.22, 23, 24.) And,</p>
            <p n="4">4. IT ſuppoſes ſome Senſe and Perſuaſion of his <hi>Love</hi> to us, without which the Soul will not go forth with free, grateful, and vehement Sallies towards him: <hi>We love him,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>John, becauſe he loved us firſt</hi> (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.19.) <hi>whom having not ſeen,</hi> i. e. by an Eye of Senſe, <hi>ye Love; yet believing ye rejoice, with Joy unſpeakable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and full of Glory</hi> (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8.)</p>
            <p>FARTHER, <hi>Love</hi> to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, implies, <hi>Eſteem, Deſire, Delight,</hi> and <hi>Sorrow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TO ſuch as love him, he is <hi>the Chief among Ten Thouſand, as the Roſe of</hi> Sharon, <hi>the Lilly of the Vallies, fairer than the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men, fairer than the Sons of God,</hi> the holy Angels, <hi>his Garments ſmell of Myrrh, Alloes, and Caſia.</hi> Farther,</p>

            <p>AGAIN, ſincere Love implies DELIGHT; <hi>I ſat down under his Shadow,</hi> ſays the Spouſe, <hi>with great Delight, and his Fruit was ſweet

            </p>
            <p>AND, Sirs, the <hi>Sorrow</hi> of the loving Soul in the Abſence of his Lord, is equal to his Delight in his Preſence: <hi>My Soul,</hi> ſays the Spouſe, <hi>failed when he ſpake, I ſought him but I could not find him!</hi> O nothing can ſupply, to Satisfaction, Chriſt's room in the Soul! when he is gone, it languiſhes and moans, in the Midſt of all the Honours, the Pleaſures, and Affluence this Earth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords, as the poor <hi>Turtle Dove,</hi> when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved of its Mate.</p>
            <p>AS to the <hi>Conſequents</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, I may obſerve, that ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have <hi>admiring Thoughts</hi> of the <hi>Freeneſs</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>Grace</hi> of GOD to them in particular, being humbled by near Views of his great Majeſty, and unſtained Purity, which in Whiteneſs out-veighs the driven Snow; and ſeeing themſelves to be the Chief of Sinners, they are juſtly amazed, that ſo glorious a Sovereign, ſhould take ſuch gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, ſuch diſtinguiſhing Notice of ſuch mean and vile Creatures as they are, when many of better Accompliſhments are paſſed by! and are ready to ſay, in the Pſalmiſts Language, <hi>what am I, and what is my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Houſe, that thou haſt brought me hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto?</hi>
               <pb n="97" facs="unknown:008266_0134_102E5230E6EBEDA0"/>
and as <hi>Jacob, I am not worthy of the leaſt of all the Mercies, and of all the Truth, which thou haſt ſhewn to thy Servant! (Gen.</hi> 32.10.)</p>
            <p>A Senſe of this inſpires their Souls with Sentiments of the moſt ardent GRATITUDE, which they are at a Loſs how to expreſs, and therefore, ſay, <hi>what ſhall I render to the Lord, for all his Benefits towards me?</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Impreſſion, they invite the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and inanimate Creation, to aſſiſt their grateful Song; and celebrate the divine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours (<hi>Pſ.</hi> 148.)</p>
            <p>FARTHER, ſuch as love the Lord Jeſus in Sincerity, make Conſcience of <hi>keeping</hi> GOD'S <hi>Commands</hi> without Exception, in Heart, Speech, and Behaviour to the Death (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.3.) <hi>for this is the Love of God, that we keep his Commandments, and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments are not grievious; then ſhall we not be aſhamed, when we have</hi> an unfailing <hi>Reſpect to all the divine Precepts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I may add, that ſuch as love Jeſus, are heartily concerned for the <hi>Honour</hi> of his <hi>Name,</hi> and <hi>Intereſts</hi> of his <hi>Kingdom;</hi> and have an unfeigned <hi>Love</hi> to the <hi>Brethren: The Reproaches of thoſe that reproach him, fall upon them;</hi> nor can they be eaſy when the Ways of <hi>Zion</hi> mourn; but on the contrary, when her Captivity is reſtored, when poor

Sinners are convinced and converted, they are as thoſe that dream, <hi>their Hearts are filled with Gladneſs, and their Lips with Laughter;</hi> while others either leſſen, diſpute or deny religious Appearances, and ſeem to be a afraid of ſome Miſchief coming upon the Churches by them; but are eaſy when Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion has ſunk into a dead Form, and is ready to Breath its laſt! Sirs, <hi>if we do not love our Brother whom we have ſeen, with a pure Heart fervently, how can we think that we love God, whom we have not ſeen!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to ſuch is <hi>unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited</hi> and entirely immerited, he pitied us when in our Blood, when there was nothing to invite his Reſpect, when we were Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Loathing and Abhorrence; then he loved us, ſpread the Skirt of his Garment over us, and bid us live!

            </p>
            <p>FARTHER, the <hi>Love</hi> of JESUS is <hi>ſtrong</hi> and <hi>affectionate</hi> to his People; they are his <hi>Jewels,</hi> his <hi>Treaſure,</hi> as the <hi>Apple</hi> of his <hi>Eye,</hi> he accoſts them in Terms of the greateſt Endearment, <hi>my Love, my Siſter, my Dove;</hi> they are written on the <hi>Palms of his Hands, and graven as a Seal upon his Heart,</hi> for their ſakes he aſſumed human

            <p>AGAIN, the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>effectual,</hi> it diſpoſes him to Guide us with his <hi>Eye</hi> in our Perplexities, to ſupport us with his <hi>Arm</hi> under all our Preſſures, and to ſanctify and ſweeten every of them to us, by his <hi>Spirit</hi> and his <hi>Love!</hi> As he has purchaſed our Salvation by the Price of his <hi>Blood,</hi> ſo he applies it, and prepares us for the full Enjoyment of it, by his conſtant <hi>Interceſſion.</hi>

our Pride, yet <hi>he will return with everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loving Kindneſs:</hi> In this the Love of Chriſt differs from, and is much ſuperiour to all human Love, which often varies, and is at longeſt but of ſhort Duration.</p>
            <p>FROM this Subject, we may learn the unhappy and dangerous State of ſuch who love not the bleſſed Lord Jeſus, ſuch who have not experienced what has been before ſaid concerning it; for all thoſe are liable to that dreadful Sentence (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.22.) <hi>if any Man love not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, let him be Anathema maranatha.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I humbly and earneſtly entreat all, but eſpecially <hi>young People and Children</hi> (with whom I hope to meet with moſt Succeſs) to <hi>Love</hi> the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>REASON invites you, for he is <hi>amiable</hi> and excellent in himſelf; is not Lovelineſs the proper Object of Love? now our dear Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is infinitely, inexpreſſibly <hi>Lovely; he is white and ruddy, the Chiefeſt among Ten Thouſand,</hi> his Lovelineſs is beſt near, whereas that of Creatures, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State of Imperfection, appears beſt at a Diſtance, like a <hi>Picture</hi> coarſely drawn: The Redeemer's <hi>Beauty</hi> does neither inſnare or fade; for his Excellency, and our Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to him are infinite! But the <hi>Beauty</hi> of <hi>Creatures fades as the Graſs,</hi> it is derived,
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:008266_0138_102E523BB99FF400"/>
dependent, and limited, and therefore may be over-valued, to the Neglect of the great Original, from which all created Excellency proceeds; and compared with which, it is but as a <hi>Drop</hi> to the immenſe <hi>Ocean,</hi> or a little Duſt in the <hi>Ballance,</hi> to the whole <hi>Globe</hi> of the Earth! In him there is a Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of all Kinds of Excellency, both created and uncreated, in the higheſt Degree of Eminence, without any Beginning, Wane, or Period: Some Creatures excel in one Grace, and ſome in others, for which they deſerve our Eſteem and Reſpect, but he excels in all at once and for ever, he is the ALPHA and OMEGA, Time or Eternity will never mar his Beauty, or wear and wrinkle in his Brow. And, dear Sirs,</p>
            <p>GRATITUDE ſhould likewiſe conſtrain you, on Account of his LOVE to poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; ſhould not Love incite Love, if not, where is your Ingenuity? are ye not worſe than PUBLICANS, in Neglect of this; for they love thoſe that love them; worſe than PAGANS, for divers of them had noble Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of Gratitude to Benefactors, and acted accordingly; yea, worſe than BEASTS, for <hi>the Ox knoweth his Owner, and the Aſs his Maſter's Crib?</hi>

your eternal Intereſt calls aloud for your <hi>Love</hi> to the dear <hi>Redeemer;</hi> in caſe you love him, he will love you in return; and if the everlaſting God, who has made all Nature with a <hi>Word,</hi> and manages the vaſt Creation by his BECK, is for you, it is no Matter who is againſt you; he will direct your Steps in every <hi>Maze</hi> of Life, and make you ſweet and ſafe in his <hi>Arms,</hi> and under his <hi>Wing;</hi> among all its ſhifting <hi>Scenes,</hi> its numberleſs <hi>Sorrows</hi> and <hi>Calamities;</hi> and in due Time bring you <hi>to a City that hath Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, whoſe Builder and Maker is God;</hi> a City built upon a firm Baſis, entirely freed from all the Viciſſitudes of the preſent State?</p>

as well as others? your Souls are as precious as theirs, God has been as good to you, Heaven would be as ſweet, and Hell will be as bitter if you neglect; why then won't you try to ſeek God in Earneſt? is it not a Shame for you to be hard-hearted, thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and ſlothful about your Souls, while <hi>other little Ones</hi> are <hi>weeping</hi> over their SINS, and <hi>praying</hi> to GOD for MERCY? won't it be dreadful for you to be left behind them, and to be caſt off, while GOD is <hi>embracing others</hi> in his <hi>Arms,</hi> and giving them the <hi>Kiſſes</hi> of his <hi>Love?</hi> you are exceeding bad and naughty in your Hearts, and your Lives are full of Sin, you cannot go to HEAVEN as you are, till you be made <hi>good,</hi> and you cannot make your ſelves good, it is the Lord only that can make you good, and you have no reaſon to hope that he will do ſo, unleſs you <hi>pray earneſtly</hi> to him for it, and ſtrive to be good! you muſt know, <hi>dear little Ones,</hi> that you do not deſerve this Favour from him, and that you cannot deſerve it by any Thing that you can do; for you yourſelves, and all ye do, are filthy and polluted by Sin, and therefore you muſt aſk free Mercy, for Chriſt's Sake!</p>
            <p>O conſider, that you may never live till you grow <hi>big,</hi> for the <hi>moſt,</hi> by far, <hi>die</hi> when they are <hi>little,</hi> and this may be your Caſe

of God, condemn your ſelves ſo far as there is Ground for it; and that not only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of your Thoughts, Words, and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but of your <hi>State;</hi> this is the <hi>Root</hi> of the <hi>Tree,</hi> to which the <hi>Ax</hi> muſt be laid; this muſt be hewn down before another Foundation be formed, which will not fail you in Extremity; what will it avail to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a deceived Heart to turn you aſide, <hi>to feed upon Aſhes, and go to ruin with a Lie in your Right Hand?</hi> it is fooliſh and vain to ſay, <hi>you are rich, and increaſed in Goods, while you are poor and miſerable, and blind and naked;</hi> and yet this, alas for it, is a common Caſe: For as SOLOMON obſerves, <hi>there is a Generation that are pure in their own Eyes, and yet are not cleanſed from their Filthineſs; there is a Way that ſeems right to a Man, the End whereof is the Ways of Death,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HOWEVER you may flatter your ſelves, the great GOD will judge according to Truth; pray is it not better to know the worſt of your Condition, while there is an Opportunity to get it remedied? it is not enough to acknowledge you are Sinners, or to <hi>fear</hi> you are <hi>unconverted,</hi> but you muſt <hi>know it,</hi> and <hi>feel</hi> its <hi>Miſeries,</hi> before you are <hi>healed.</hi>

not? are you <hi>converted</hi> or not? perhaps you will anſwer with an Air of Indifference, I do not know; how, not know what is of the greateſt Conſequence for you to know of any Thing elſe? without this you do not know whether you ſhould be comforted or terrified, or how to pray or praiſe, or do any other Duty of Religion; for you know not what to pray for, or what to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for: If your State is good, you need the Comfort of it in a World of Change and Miſery, and if bad, to be affected with a View of the Dangers of it, that ſo you may prize the Redeemer, and ſeek him in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt; for <hi>the Whole need no Phyſician, but the Sick;</hi> the Want of this Knowledge, makes all your <hi>religious Labours,</hi> a kind of <hi>Chance-medley,</hi> a <hi>By-buſineſs,</hi> a Matter of mere <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Compliment,</hi> that are never like to anſwer a valuable End; no! by theſe ignorant, luke-warm, random Performances, you are like to fix your ſelves on a falſe <hi>Bottom,</hi> to your utter <hi>Ruin!</hi>

            <p>IF your <hi>State</hi> could not be known by you, you would have ſome APOLOGY; but the Caſe is not ſo, it may be known; the Almighty has inſerted many <hi>Characters</hi> of a <hi>Work</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> in his <hi>Word,</hi> by which he commands you to try your ſelves; but you are either ſo <hi>lazy,</hi> that you do not care to be

at the Pains to enquire, or <hi>afraid</hi> that if you did, you would be uneaſy; well, what if you was uneaſy for a little Time, in order to your obtaining true reſt, is not this better than to be eternally tormented in Hell? your Reaſon muſt ſay yes, why then do you act the Contrary? you take it for granted, either before <hi>Trial,</hi> or after a very partial, ſuperficial one, that your <hi>Foundation</hi> is right, nor do you deſire Aſſiſtance in your <hi>Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> no you think becauſe you are <hi>Fools</hi> and <hi>blind,</hi> that you have Knowledge enough your ſelves, to determine that important Point, upon which your eternal ALL turns; but if you were awakened out of your Sleep, and ſaw your Ignorance, Vileneſs, and the Worth of your Souls, as <hi>Peter</hi>'s Hearers, and the <hi>Jaylor</hi> did, you would enquire of others, who could direct you, what you ſhould do to be ſaved, and that with great Anxiety! as to your <hi>Bodies</hi> when in Danger, you will conſult a <hi>Phyſician,</hi> and a <hi>Lawyer</hi> about your Eſtates, and why ſo, but becauſe you love and value them? but the <hi>Salvation</hi> of your poor SOULS, is a mere <hi>Trifle</hi> in your Eſteem, and therefore you can take that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Truſt any how! a Proof of which is, your being without any conſiderable Unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs about them, for Weeks, Months, nay Years; though you do not know whether

you are <hi>juſtified</hi> or <hi>condemned, curſed</hi> or <hi>bleſſed, Children</hi> of GOD, or of the <hi>Devil,</hi> bound for <hi>Heaven</hi> or <hi>Hell:</hi> This, without any other Evidence, proves to your Faces, that you are in the Gall of Bitterneſs and Bond of Iniquity, becauſe you are <hi>Fleſh;</hi> but to bring the Matter to a Point, you may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly conclude your State is <hi>damnable.</hi> If</p>

            <p>WELL, but perhaps you will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that ſuch as have no evangelical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, no ſaving Faith, ſhall periſh; and that you yourſelves want them, and yet if I immediately aſk you again, what if you die this very Day, in the ſame State you acknowledge yourſelves to be in without a Change, where will your Souls go? you will tell me in the ſame Breath, you do not

            <p n="2">2.

            <p>TO prevent APOSTACY, before you make any <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> pray <hi>count the Coſt</hi> upon the one Hand, and the <hi>Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs</hi> and <hi>Advantages</hi> of it upon the other; and remember that our Lord himſelf has told you, that if <hi>you will be his Diſciples, you muſt bear his Croſs,</hi> i. e. not only reſolve to endure it when it comes in the Way of Duty, with Patience, Fortitude, and Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, but actually do ſo, without meanly ſhrinking on Account of any Danger what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; you muſt <hi>go without the Camp to Chriſt, bearing his Reproach,</hi> forſake the deareſt Relations, if they unreaſonably op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe your pious Progreſs, and <hi>not count even your Lives dear to yourſelves, that you may finiſh your Courſe with Joy, and not with Grief;</hi> upon <hi>lower Terms</hi> you cannot, in very Deed, be the <hi>Diſciples</hi> of the holy JESUS.</p>

The AUTHOR of this Intreaty, is the ever bleſſed GOD; he it is who invites Sinners to turn from the Evil of their Ways, his Authority over us is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and unqueſtionable, having made us by his Power, and to him we are under infinite Obligations, in Point of Reaſon and Gratitude, becauſe of his ſupream Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence and Perfection, and the innumerable, invaluable, and immerited Benefits we have received from him, among which this IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TREATY is one, which is calculated to

promote not his, but our Benefit, for <hi>our Goodneſs does not extend to him, nor is it any Gain to God that we are righteous.</hi> The OBJECT of the Intreaty, is more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately and expreſly the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but indirectly and virtually all unregenerate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of every Age and Nation; for <hi>what was written before Time, was written for our Learning, upon whom the Ends of the World are come;</hi> though the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed God's Name, and were outwardly devoted to his Service; yet many of them had a Temper and Conduct very unſuitable thereto, and alas, this is the woeful Caſe of many among us.

Deeds of the Law therefore, no Fleſh living can be juſtified in the Sight of God: The Law which was ordained to Life,</hi> in caſe of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Obedience, i. e. was deſigned to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure eternal Life upon that Condition, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences him that breaks it, <hi>to Death; for if Righteouſneſs had come by the Law,</hi> i. e. if it might be obtained by Obedience to the Law, <hi>then Chriſt had died in vain,</hi> for if the Caſe was ſo, there would have been no need of his Death; but <hi>the Law was weak through the Fleſh,</hi> i. e. unable to Juſtify us by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our Corruption, the proper Uſe of the Law therefore, in our fallen State, is to be a <hi>School-Maſter,</hi> to <hi>bring us to Chriſt, that we may be juſtified by Faith in him;</hi> to awake us to a feeling of our Sin, Miſery, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, by its <hi>Precepts,</hi> and the <hi>Scourge</hi> of its <hi>Curſes,</hi> that ſo we may be conſtrained to fly to a MEDIATOR, and rely only on his Merits for this Purpoſe; <hi>it is added to the Promiſe,</hi> and hence when it is applied by the Spirit, it <hi>convinces of Sin,</hi> cauſes it to <hi>revive</hi> in our View, and all our falſe Hopes by it to <hi>die, it works Wrath,</hi> fills the awakned Tranſgreſſor with reaſonable Terror and Dread of the Wrath of God, for it <hi>ſhuts him up under Sin, and binds him over to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Condemnation.</hi> But perhaps it may be objected, that I ſpeak againſt the <hi>Law</hi> of

are Multitudes under the Goſpel, ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their own wretched <hi>Bottom,</hi> and muſt anſwer for their Millions of Treſpaſſes in their own Perſons.

            <p>I return to the firſt propoſed, which was, to ſhew <hi>what Perſons may attain to without Converſion;</hi> this ſhould be attended to with the greateſt Earneſtneſs and Care, for if our Attainments in Religion, do not exceed what I ſhall now mention, we are certainly in a damnable State, and muſt aſſuredly periſh if we die ſo. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1.

him to inſtruct others, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding continued a Traitor, and went to his own Place: No doubt ſound Principles are in their Place neceſſary and valuable, but unleſs they ſuitably influence the Heart and Life, they are inſufficient to Salvation; it is therefore vain to depend upon a <hi>Form of Knowledge, and of the Truth in the Law,</hi> while the Heart remains unrenewed (<hi>Rom.</hi> 2.20.)</p>
            <p n="3">3.

Though na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Men are inclined to abuſe Externals, by depending upon them, while they in the mean Time want an inward Renovation, yet it is obſervable, that the Method the Prophets, Chriſt, and his Apoſtles took in this Caſe, was not to oppoſe outward Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances abſolutely, and to tear them up by the Roots; but only to oppoſe a ſinful Dependance on them, and Contentment with them, in want of what they ſignify, and oblige to; which indeed is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, dangerous, and deſtructive, a notorious Perverſion of the Deſign of thoſe

we have great Reaſon to be thankful for to God, when we deſcend from <hi>pious Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors,</hi> for oftentimes a Bleſſing comes upon the Offspring of ſuch, to the third and fourth Generation, yet when Perſons depend upon this, without imitating their good Examples, yea, when they go on in a contrary Courſe of Impiety, it is very abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, as our Saviour obſerves; agreeable to which, is the following excellent Saying of a <hi>Pagan,</hi> What our <hi>Anceſtors</hi> have nobly done, I cannot call ours <note n="‡" place="bottom">Que <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

            <p>IN a preceeding Sermon, upon this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Text, I propoſed to ſpeak upon four Heads, which were theſe, 1. To ſhew what Perſons may attain to in Religion without Converſion, 2. To Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of what is ordinarily preparatory to this Change, 3. To <hi>explain</hi> its Nature, and 4. Repreſent its Neceſſity: It is only the firſt of theſe that has been eſſayed; I now proceed to the</p>
            <p n="2">2. HEAD of Diſcourſe, <hi>viz.</hi> to treat of what is ordinarily PREPARATORY to a gracious CHANGE; and that is a Work of <hi>Conviction by the holy Spirit, through the Law, whereby the Sinner is made to ſee the utter Impoſſibility of Juſtification, by Obedience to it, and is
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:008266_0222_102E53154B660B88"/>
ſhut up to Chriſt, as the only Door of Hope; I through the Law am dead to the Law,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle Paul, <hi>that I might live unto God;</hi> and elſewhere <hi>the Law</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>our School-Maſter, to bring us to Chriſt, that we may be juſtified by Faith (Gal.</hi> 3.24.) this is effected in the following Manner, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. THE <hi>Law</hi> being applied by the holy <hi>Spirit</hi> to the Soul, <hi>convinces</hi> of Sin, and hence it is ſaid, that <hi>by the Law is the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Sin,</hi> and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> declares of himſelf, that <hi>he had not known Sin but by the Law (Rom.</hi> 7.7.) <hi>without the Law,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Sin was dead,</hi> i. e. in my Apprehenſion, for <hi>I was alive without the Law once,</hi> e. g. had a falſe Hope of the Safety of my State, <hi>was alive to the Law,</hi> expected Juſtification by it; but <hi>when the Commandment came, Sin revived, and I died;</hi> when the Law was applied to my Conſcience by the Spirit, I had an affecting View of my Sins, and loſt my falſe Hope of Righteouſneſs by the Law, and that groundleſs Chearfulneſs that flowed from it! that the holy Spirit concurs with the Law to this Purpoſe, appears from <hi>John</hi> 16.7, 8. <hi>and when he is come, he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove or convince (Elenchei) the World of Sin;</hi> the Law being the Rule of Action, and Sin being a Tranſgreſſion of this Law, it is therefore a fit Mean to convince of Sin,
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:008266_0223_102E5316CE8715F0"/>
yet it is but a Mean, and therefore does it not to Purpoſe, till the <hi>holy Spirit</hi> opens it by his Influence, in its ſpiritual Extent to the Mind, and ſets it Home upon the Heart. Here obſerve, that the <hi>holy Spirit</hi> (1.) <hi>Convinces</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> in the <hi>Life,</hi> thus it was with <hi>Peter</hi>'s Hearers, while he boldly and faithfully charged upon them, the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixion of Chriſt, they <hi>were pricked in their Heart (Acts</hi> 2.36, 37.) the Guilt of this Sin was faſtened upon them, but tho' <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction</hi> begins with one Sin, yet it ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers many more, which appear, as tho' ranged in <hi>Battalia,</hi> againſt the Sinner; thus it was with the Woman of <hi>Samaria, John</hi> 4.29. <hi>come ſee a Man, that told me all Things that ever I did.</hi> (2.) The <hi>holy Spirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> in the <hi>Heart,</hi> after a Diſcovery of Sins in the <hi>Life,</hi> he leads the Sinner to behold the corrupt <hi>Fountain,</hi> from which they flow; and indeed the Wickedneſs of the Heart is aſtoniſhing and inexpreſſible, it exceeds that of the Life, as much as a Fountain, the Streams that proceed from it; <hi>the Heart is deceitful, and deſperately wicked, who can know it? from it come Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Adulteries, and Falſe-witneſs:</hi> Now the awakened Sinner may ſee, that there is not the leaſt Grain of Goodneſs in his Heart, that he is quite dead in Sin, an Enemy
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:008266_0224_102E53196D65FA90"/>
to God and his Law, <hi>ſhapen in Iniquity, and conceived in Sin;</hi> whatever Sinners dream, the Teſtimony of God is true, that <hi>the fleſhly Mind is Enmity againſt God (Rom.</hi> 8.7.) natural Men that are regular in Life, are pleaſed with a Notion of their own Goodneſs, but when their Eyes are opened by the Law and Spirit of God, to ſee their Inſide, they are frightned at the Sight; for they plainly find that they are full of impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Spite againſt the bleſſed God, full of brutiſh, mean and immoderately ſelfiſh Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, mere <hi>Monſters</hi> in <hi>Iniquity,</hi> Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Sin, and Maſſes of Abomination! in a Word, awakened Sinners find, that their ſelfiſh, ſorry Sort of Goodneſs, of which they boaſted, and on which they depended, is but like the ſpecious <hi>Skin</hi> of a <hi>Serpent;</hi> and here give me Leave to ſay, that ſuch as oppoſe a ſtrong Repreſentation of the Corruption of human Nature, act the Part of Enemies to Chriſt, and the Souls of Men; for till Sinners ſee their Depravity, they will not be humble, and flee to the Mediator. (3.) The <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> by the <hi>Law, convinces</hi> the Sinner of a <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Sin;</hi> he clearly ſees that he is unjuſtified and unconverted, and cannot be ſaved in his preſent State; the <hi>Prodigal</hi> ſaw he was <hi>periſhing,</hi> before he aroſe and came to his Father, he felt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

               <hi>loſt</hi> and <hi>dead,</hi> before he was <hi>found</hi> and made <hi>alive (Luke</hi> 15.) <hi>The Commandment which was ordained to Life, I found to be unto Death; for Sin taking Occaſion by the Commandment deceived me, and by it ſlew me,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle; when the Law came with Power and Authority to his Conſcience, he was convinced he was a dead Man, in Law and Fact, i. e. ſentenced to eternal Death, and void of ſpiritual Life, and therefore was ſlain to all preſent and future Depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon Obedience to the <hi>Law</hi> for Righteouſneſs, or for the Remiſſion of Sins, and a Right to Salvation, ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.10, 11. This lays the Ax to the Root of the Tree; the <hi>Law</hi> is called <hi>the Letter that killeth, a Miniſtration of Death, a Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Condemnation</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7.) becauſe being applied, it kills the ſecure Sinners falſe <hi>Hopes</hi> of Righteouſneſs, by any Thing that he can do, and ſenſibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns him in his preſent State to eternal DEATH; he now ſees that all the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings in the Book of God belong to him, and therefore he applies them particularly to himſelf; as the <hi>Prophet,</hi> his <hi>Parable</hi> to DAVID; <hi>I am the Man,</hi> that theſe Curſes are directed againſt! he hears his Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation frequently ſounded from Mount <hi>Ebal!</hi>

               <pb n="189" facs="unknown:008266_0226_102E531ED1DA1568"/>2. AFTER convincing of <hi>Sin</hi> in Life, in Heart, and State, as has been obſerved, the holy <hi>Spirit convinces</hi> of the <hi>Miſery</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent upon it; what Miſery? I anſwer, the Curſe of God, the Wrath of God, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Death; <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.9, 10. <hi>He that is of the Works of the Law, is under the Curſe; for curſed is every one that continueth not in all Things that are written in the Book of the Law to do them: We are by Nature, Children of Wrath; Eph.</hi> 2.1: Why? Becauſe <hi>we are born in Sin;</hi> Wrath is our Inheritance by Law, for our Violation of the Law; <hi>the Soul that Sins ſhall die,</hi> temporarily, ſpiritually, and eternally, according to Law! now the convinced Sinner ſees clearly and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratively, as the original Word (<hi>John</hi> 16.8.) imports, the Miſery he is expoſed to for Sin, which is (1.) <hi>Real,</hi> no melancholy Fancy, but an awful Reality, he knows by the Reflections of his guilty Conſcience, that his Sins have been real, numerous, or rather numberleſs, and highly aggravated; and is induced, by a Conſciouſneſs of the Demerit of Sin, and a Belief of the Word of God, to a full Perſwaſion that the Wrath of God, and Pains of Damnation, due for Sin, are real, and not to be trifled with! (2.) He ſees this <hi>Miſery</hi> to be great and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible! O how terrible is it to be curſed
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:008266_0227_102E5321912B62C0"/>
and condemned by that GOD who only can bleſs! curſed by him who is infinite in Wiſdom and Strength, and can execute the Import of the Curſe, againſt the combined Force of the whole Creation! how dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is his Vengeance in HELL! there is avenging Juſtice, without the leaſt Mixture of Mercy; Pain without Eaſe, and Torment without Reſt; an unmixed Cup of Wrath, continual Suffering, without any Intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Allay, or End; the damned drink large Draughts of the Wine of the Wrath of God, and yet their Cup is always full, becauſe the Vengeance of God, incenſed by Sin, is infinite! But (3.) The convinced Sinner ſees his <hi>Miſery</hi> to be <hi>certain,</hi> while in a State of Blindneſs and Security, he uſed to flatter himſelf with the vain and falſe Hopes of Heaven, though he went on in his old Courſe, and kept his old Heart (<hi>Deut.</hi> 29.19.) he ſpoke Peace, Peace to himſelf, contrary to the expreſs Declarations of God's Word, but now he ſees that God is holy, juſt, righteous, and true, and that he will not be mocked, and cannot be deceived, and therefore that all the Curſes of the Book of God are upon him, and that ſudden Deſtruction will ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeize him, and he cannot, ſhall not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape in his preſent State!

(2.) You are <hi>dead,</hi> void of divine Life, wholly dead, otherwiſe you would hear the awful <hi>Thunders</hi> of <hi>Sinai,</hi> with ſome <hi>Dread</hi> of

God's <hi>Vengeance,</hi> with ſome <hi>Feeling</hi> of your woeful Caſe you would <hi>mourn,</hi> when the <hi>Sword</hi> of God's <hi>Law</hi> is ſtabbed into your <hi>Hearts,</hi> but alas, not one <hi>Sigh,</hi> not one <hi>Groan!</hi> (3.) You are <hi>mad, Luke</hi> 15, 17. As ſoon as the PRODIGAL came to himſelf, he felt he was periſhing, and reſolved to go to his Father; and whenever you come to yourſelves, to your Senſes, you will have the ſame Feeling, the ſame Purpoſe, but alas, it is far from it; you are as blind as Moles, and as ſtupid as Stones; like Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, you wound yourſelves mortally in Sport, and ſell your precious Souls to Satan and Damnation, for a Thing of Nought! (4.) You are condemned and guilty Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>John</hi> 3.18. <hi>He that believeth not, is condemned already,</hi> by the <hi>great God,</hi> to <hi>Damnation!

You are quite <hi>out</hi> of the <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>Mercy,</hi> and ſhall certainly be for ever <hi>damned,</hi> if ye continue ſo: It is a mere <hi>Jeſt</hi> for you to expect to be <hi>converted</hi> while you are <hi>aſleep;</hi> in this <hi>State,</hi> your <hi>Hopes</hi> of <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs</hi> are a <hi>Deluſion</hi> of the <hi>Devil,</hi> your very <hi>Bleſſings accurſed,</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> a <hi>Savour</hi> of <hi>Death</hi> unto <hi>Death,</hi> and the <hi>Sacraments Seals</hi> of <hi>Damnation!</hi> The God of Truth has ſaid, he will find you out, who are ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled on your <hi>Lees, and puniſh you?

            <p n="2">2.

Repent and believe the Goſpel; God's Mercy is high, above your Thoughts, the Grace of Chriſt is inexpreſſibly rich and free; do not be kept from believing, by the Greatneſs and Number of your Sins, or becauſe you have not had ſuch deep Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs as ſome others; remember, that tho' your Iniquities be as Crimſon and Scarlet, be will make them white as Snow, as ſoon as ye believe.

            <p>THE two Heads that I am now to diſcourſe upon, according to the Order before propoſed, are theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> 1, To <hi>explain</hi> the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Converſion:</hi> And, 2. To <hi>repreſent</hi> its <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity.</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE NATURE of CONVERSION, may be thus deſcribed, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is a gracious <hi>Renewing</hi> of fallen Man, for Chriſt's Sake, after the <hi>moral Image</hi> of GOD, whereby the ſeveral <hi>Powers</hi> and <hi>Paſſions</hi> of the <hi>Soul,</hi> have new <hi>Qualities</hi> infuſed, and free and general <hi>Tendencies</hi> towards God and divine Things, as their <hi>Element</hi> and <hi>Center;</hi> the Effect of which is, a Converſation agreeable to the Goſpel of CHRIST. Our firſt <hi>Parents</hi>
               <pb n="210" facs="unknown:008266_0247_102E53559D44C470"/>
were made after the <hi>Image</hi> of God, which conſiſts in Knowledge, Righteouſneſs, and Holineſs (<hi>Gen.</hi> 1.27. <hi>Ecle.</hi> 7.29.) a univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Rectitude poſſeſſed the whole Soul, with all its Powers and Paſſions, the <hi>Mind</hi> with Eaſe and Certainty, apprehended what God required; the <hi>Will</hi> complied with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of the Mind without Reluctance, and the lower <hi>Paſſions</hi> were obedient to both; thus harmonious was Man in his firſt State. But the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> of our firſt Parents, in violating the Covenant of Works, broke the aforeſaid <hi>Harmony,</hi> and introduced ſuch a Depravity into the human Soul, as has both corrupted and miſplaced all its Faculties; the <hi>Mind</hi> is blinded, the <hi>Will obſtinate,</hi> and the <hi>Affections</hi> confuſed, either fixed upon ſinful Objects, or carried towards lawful ones immoderately: The Will, a blind Power, uſurps the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings Place, to direct and rule the Soul, and enforces its arbitrary Dictates by a tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Authority, which is very perilous. The Veſſel muſt certainly be in great Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, when a blind and furious Man has the Direction of the Helm in a Tempeſt.</p>
            <p>NOW <hi>Converſion</hi> is a <hi>Renewing</hi> us after the <hi>Image</hi> of GOD, not the <hi>Phyſical,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in the ſpiritual Nature of the Soul, for that we never loſt, elſe our Souls muſt
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:008266_0248_102E535721678B50"/>
be anihilated; not the <hi>Political,</hi> conſiſting in Dominion over the lower Creation; Power over other Creatures, is no Doubt a valuable Privilege, but in the mean Time, no Part of a gracious Change, which may and often does Subſiſt without it; it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>moral Image</hi> of GOD, we are <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed after</hi> by <hi>Converſion,</hi> conſiſting in a <hi>Reſemblance</hi> of <hi>God's</hi> moral and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable <hi>Perfections,</hi> which are repreſented in, and recommended by the <hi>moral Law,</hi> the invariable <hi>Scale</hi> of Action. <hi>Converſion</hi> brings back the ſeveral <hi>Powers</hi> of the <hi>Soul</hi> from the <hi>Ruins</hi> of our <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> and reſtores them in ſome Meaſure, to their primitive <hi>Beauty, Order,</hi> and <hi>Harmony,</hi> for hereby the <hi>Mind</hi> is enlightned and enthroned, the <hi>Will</hi> made pliant, and the <hi>Affections</hi> rectified. The firſt <hi>moving Cauſe</hi> of this bleſſed Change, is the mere <hi>Mercy</hi> of GOD; <hi>We are born not of the Will of the Fleſh, nor of the Will of Man, but of God? it is not by Works of Righteouſneſs that we have done, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Mercy he ſaved us, by the waſhing of Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt (Tit.</hi> 3.5.) the <hi>deſerving Cauſe,</hi> is the <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Chriſt, Tit.</hi> 3.6. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of Regeneration, in the preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Verſe, ſays, <hi>Which he ſhed on us abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour;</hi> and
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:008266_0249_102E5358A38A2118"/>
hence we are ſaid to be <hi>waſhed from our Sins in his Blood;</hi> had he not laid down his Life for Sinners, they never would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed. The <hi>inſtrumental Cauſe,</hi> is the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Being born again, not of corruptible Seed, but of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible, by the Word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever;</hi> and hence we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that <hi>Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.</hi> The <hi>efficient Cauſe,</hi> is the <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> and therefore it is called <hi>the Renewing of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by his Influence, he convinces and converts the Sinner from the Evil of his Ways, to the Wiſdom of the Juſt; without his Operation, neither Law nor Goſpel, however faithfully diſpenſed, will have any ſaving Effect upon the Souls of Men, the dry Bones will never ſhake: <hi>Come therefore from the four Winds, O Breath, and breathe upon the Slain, that they may live.</hi> The <hi>final Cauſe</hi> ſubordinate, is <hi>Holineſs of Life; We are created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good Works, that we may walk in them;</hi> before we are converted, we cannot do any good Works, we are therefore created anew for this very End, that we may do them: But the <hi>final Cauſe ſupream,</hi> is the <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>God's Grace, Eph.</hi> 1.3, 6. <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath bleſſed us
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:008266_0250_102E535D8F1DB0A0"/>
with all ſpiritual Bleſſings in Chriſt, to the Praiſe of the Glory of his Grace;</hi> he pitied and loved us in our Blood, when we were Objects of Loathing and Abhorrence, and bid us live; O glorious, O amazing, pure, rich, and ſovereign Grace! But in order to open the important Point under Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, more particularly and fully, let us take a tranſient View of the ſeveral <hi>Qualities</hi> infuſed into the different Powers of the Soul, and the conſequent Change upon them, or good Tendencies thereby produced. I call them Qualities, to ſignify that the Eſſence of the Soul ſtill remains the ſame, both before and after Converſion; the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty by this Change, does not Form a new Soul, as to Subſtance, but only infuſes new and different Qualities or Diſpoſitions, by which the Soul's Powers generally and freely incline to different Objects, from what they did before: Theſe Qualities are that Principle of ſpiritual LIFE, that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantaniouſly communicated at Converſion, which the ſacred Scriptures inform us, is a <hi>Quickning of the Dead:</hi> As natural Life to which this alludes, is a fixed, abiding Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Action, and ſpreads its Influence through the whole Frame, this does ſo likewiſe, and hence our Saviour obſerves, that he <hi>that drinks of this Water, ſhall never
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:008266_0251_102E53602FAAE568"/>
thirſt again;</hi> i. e. ſo as before, after the Things of this Life, but <hi>they ſhall be in him as a Well of Waters, ſpringing up to eternal Life.</hi> Not like a <hi>Land Flood,</hi> which is ſoon dried up by the Summer Heat, or frozen by the Winter Cold, but like a <hi>living Fountain,</hi> whoſe Waters do not fail, but are both free and permanent: To the ſame Purpoſe, the Converted are ſaid to be Partakers of the divine Nature (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4.) i. e. of holy Diſpoſitions, reſembling the divine Nature, in regard both of Purity and Permanency; their good Diſpoſitions are not a tranſient <hi>Flaſh,</hi> but an abiding, pious <hi>Temper</hi> of <hi>Soul,</hi> as it were another Nature: To the ſame Purpoſe, are theſe Words of the Apoſtle (<hi>John</hi> 1. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.9.) <hi>Whoſoever is born of God, doth not commit Sin</hi> (does not go on in a Courſe of Sin) <hi>for his Seed remaineth in him.</hi> Now the <hi>good Qualities</hi> infuſed at Converſion are, eſpecially theſe following, <hi>viz.</hi> (1.) <hi>Light</hi> in the <hi>Mind;</hi> as natural <hi>Light</hi> was one of the firſt Things produced in the <hi>old Creation (Gen.</hi> 1.3.) ſo <hi>ſpiritual Light</hi> is one of the firſt in the <hi>New,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. (2.) <hi>Pliableneſs</hi> in the <hi>Will,</hi> to follow the Guidance of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned Mind; <hi>the Necks</hi> of Sinners, by Nature are an <hi>Iron Sinnew,</hi> and their <hi>Brow, Braſs;</hi> but the Almighty <hi>makes his People a
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:008266_0252_102E5361B5E25790"/>
willing People, in the Day of his Power.</hi> (3.) <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Harmony</hi> among the Affections, in following the Leadings of the Mind and Will, on which Account the Spouſe is ſaid to be all glorious within. (4.) <hi>Tenderneſs</hi> in the <hi>Conſcience,</hi> when it is purged from dead Works (<hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14.) it rebukes for ſmall Offences; <hi>David</hi>'s Heart ſmote him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had cut off <hi>Saul</hi>'s Skirt, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.5. and excites to beware of ſmall Sins, as well as great, yea, to beware of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to Evil, and the very Appearance of it; the burnt Child dreads the Fire; it ſtirs up thoſe that have it, to exert their utmoſt Labour and Vigilance, to keep clear of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence towards God and Man, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.16. whereas the Conſciences of the Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted in general, are large, ſecure, and moſtly ſilent, unleſs when they commit groſs and notorious Crimes; <hi>for to them that are undefiled and unbelieving, is nothing pure, but even their Mind and Conſcience is defiled.</hi> (5.) <hi>Retention</hi> of divine Things in the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory;</hi> the converted Perſon loves the Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of JESUS, more than formerly, and therefore Endeavours more to lay them up in the <hi>Cabinet</hi> of his <hi>Memory; Thy Word have I bid in my Heart,</hi> ſays the Pſalmiſt, <hi>That I might not Sin againſt thee, Pſ.</hi> 119.11. It is true, the Grace of GOD does not
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:008266_0253_102E53644BE92DD8"/>
change the natural, but moral Weakneſs of human Nature, for its Deſign is not to heal the Body, but the Soul; and therefore a Perſon may be much advanced in Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and yet have but a weak Memory; yet as the Grace of God aſſiſts our Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of Foundation Truths, and fixes our Love upon them, it muſt of Conſequence make us deſirous to retain them, and grieved when we do not, ſo that we are like to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member more of them than of any Thing elſe. I now proceed to conſider the <hi>Change</hi> in the principal Powers of the Soul, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Underſtanding, Will,</hi> and <hi>Affections,</hi> which is the conſequent of, and promoted by the gracious Principles of ſpiritual Life, infuſed at Converſion. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE UNDERSTANDING is changed in its <hi>Views</hi> of Things, <hi>Aſſent</hi> to them, and <hi>Eſtimate</hi> concerning them; now he ſees the loathſome and abominable Nature of Sin, ſo as to bewail it with Bitterneſs as for a Firſtborn, and groan for Deliverance from it, with the Apoſtle, <hi>O wretched Man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this Body of Sin and Death!</hi> He ſees with Affection the tranſcendent Excellency and peerleſs Beauty of the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who is now to him, <hi>as the Apple Tree among the Trees of the Wood, as the Roſe of Sharon, and the
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:008266_0254_102E53680E130ED0"/>
Lilly of the Vallies; his Name is as Ointment poured forth, and his Garments ſmell of Myrrh, Alloes, and Caſſia!</hi> He ſees in a ſtrong Point of Light, the <hi>Beauty</hi> of <hi>Holineſs;</hi> that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Purity, and outward Circumſpection, which he before imagined to be needleſs Preciſeneſs, he now looks upon to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and lovely; he perceives ſtriking Charms in <hi>Humility,</hi> and honeſt <hi>Zeal</hi> for God, which he never ſaw before! (2.) The Mind yields a new Aſſent to them, not grounded upon Conjecture, Opinion, or hiſtorical Credit; but upon the Application of divine Truths to the Soul, by the holy Spirit, whereby ſuch pious Impreſſions are made, as convince him of their divine Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal; thus the natural <hi>Atheiſm</hi> of his Heart is healed, and he induced to yield a full and firm Aſſent to the abſolute Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of revealed Religion; he has a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs within himſelf, that it is <hi>no cunningly deviſed Fable,</hi> but true, as God is Truth; his Views of Things, and Aſſent to them, being altered, it naturally follows; (3.) That the <hi>Eſtimate</hi> will be altered likewiſe, for that is formed according to the Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion we have of the Nature, Moment, and Certainty of Things, and the Temper and Character of Perſons: Formerly he uſed to think that <hi>Converſion</hi> was but a
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:008266_0255_102E536AB1816A88"/>
mere <hi>Whim</hi> of ſome melancholly, enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical People, but now he ſees it to be of abſolute <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> and that notwithſtanding of all his good Meanings, Words, and Works, which he uſed to think would do great Matters, he muſt periſh without it: Communion with God he now values, as the Life and Soul of <hi>Religion,</hi> which before he uſed to think was either needleſs, or enthuſiaſtical<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and dangerous: That noble <hi>Zeal</hi> for God, that is ready to run any Riſque for his Honour and Kingdom, which he formerly reckoned imprudent Raſhneſs, now he judges to be amiable and heroic! and on the Contrary, <hi>trimming</hi> according to the Cuſtoms of Times and Places, in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, with deſign to get Credit among the Ungodly, and ſleep in a whole Skin, which he was wont to call <hi>Prudence,</hi> he now judges to be ſneaking <hi>Cowardice,</hi> and ſelfiſh <hi>Craft!</hi> Formerly he verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that Happineſs conſiſted in Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and therefore he faithfully ſought it, for that End; but now he finds his Faith to be a Falacy, and that Perſons may be perfectly miſerable, in the Midſt of Afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence! which can no more ſatisfy the Mind, than Wind and Gravel the Stomach; he therefore, with <hi>Moſes, eſteems Reproach for Chriſt, to be greater Riches than the Treaſures
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:008266_0256_102E536C341782A0"/>
of Egypt,</hi> the Treaſures of the Univerſe (<hi>Heb.</hi> 11.26.) the truly Pious, whom he uſed to reckon, at beſt, but a ſilly Sort of People, if not Enthuſiaſts and Hypocrites, and therefore deſpiſed them; now he va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues as the moſt wiſe and excellent in the <hi>Earth.</hi> Farther, the Mercy and Goodneſs of God, from whence he encouraged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Sin and Security, he now ſees and feels to be the greateſt Incentive to Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! But to proceed,</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE WILL is changed in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Reſpects, <hi>viz.</hi> (1.) In its Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Tendencies, theſe bend towards God, in Chriſt, freely and generally, as a <hi>Center,</hi> from an inward and powerful Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Life (<hi>John</hi> 4.14.) his Will has an unconſtrained and conſtant Motion, even when outward Enforcements are taken away; becauſe it acts from an inward and vital Cauſe (<hi>Pſ.</hi> 119.112.) but the pious Tendencies of the Unconverted are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, and therefore inconſtant, ſome of them under the Views of Eternity, or ſome other Affliction, have weak Motions of the Will towards God (<hi>Pſ.</hi> 78.34.) but when the Proſpect of Danger is removed, the Motions ceaſe, like that of a Clock when the Spring is taken away. (2.) The Will is changed in its <hi>Choice,</hi> its principal Acts
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:008266_0257_102E536ED632B188"/>
are Aſſent or Diſſent, theſe are the Hinges upon which it exerts its receptive or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive Powers, according to its Love or Diſlike to the Object propoſed; now before Converſion, the Sinner thinks the <hi>Terms</hi> upon which Chriſt is offered too <hi>ſevere,</hi> and therefore diſlikes them, and rejects him; they <hi>will not come to him, that they might have Life;</hi> yea, they keep him without the Door of their Hearts, <hi>till his Head is wet with the Dew, and his Locks with the Drops of the Night!</hi> but the regenerate Perſon, after having deliberately conſidered the Terms upon which Chriſt and his Benefits are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to him, freely and fully conſents to them with his Will, and ſo receives the Son of God as his <hi>Prophet, Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> yea as his everlaſting All in All; and is hereby actually inſtated in all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Purchaſe of his Blood, <hi>John</hi> 1.12. (3.) It is changed in its <hi>Deſigns</hi> and Aims, which are now very different from what they were before: While in a State of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, his Deſigns and Purpoſes were for Sin and Self, but now they are for God and his Soul; now he labours as much to get his Affections dead'ned to the World, as he did before to get great Poſſeſſions in it; now with a ſingle Eye he aims at the <hi>Glory</hi> of GOD, as his <hi>chief Mark</hi> in all his
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:008266_0258_102E5373A8C18090"/>
               <hi>Purſuits,</hi> and with an anxious Heart, often contrives what Meaſures he ſhall take to honour him, and promote the deſpiſed, but truly noble Intereſts of his Kingdom! The Purpoſes of the Unregenerate reſpecting Religion, are weak, partial, and future; they do but half reſolve to ſerve God, and that not at preſent, but in ſome future Point of Time; nor do they reſolve to forſake all Sin, and perform all Duty, but only ſome, ſuch as are conſiſtent with their Credit, Eaſe, and Intereſt: But the reſolves of the Converted are ſtrong, impartial, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; his Determination is full and firm to forſake all Sin immediately, without a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's Delay, and to perform every Duty required, by divine Help, though it ſhould coſt him his Life!</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE AFFECTIONS of the <hi>Soul</hi> are <hi>changed, viz.</hi> Love, Deſire, Delight, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, Fear, and Hatred, in reſpect of their Objects and Tendencies; and (1.) The bleſſed God, his People, Laws, Image, and Ordinances, are the Objects of his <hi>Love;</hi> the ſupream Affection of the Converted is fixed on <hi>God,</hi> in Chriſt, as their higheſt Good and laſt End, as their compleat ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, and everlaſting Portion! <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.24.

(2.) The <hi>Deſires</hi> of the Regenerate run for the moſt Part, and in the higheſt Degree, in a ſpiritual <hi>Channel.</hi> They</p>
            <p>Frequently long after Communion with, and Conformity to God, in Chriſt, here, and the full Enjoyment of him hereafter, from a Sight of his Beauty and Excellency; to this Purpoſe, the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affectionate Language, <hi>My Soul followeth hard after thee, my Heart and Fleſh cry out for the living God!</hi> (3.) Their chief <hi>Delight</hi> is in Chriſt, <hi>a Bundle of Myrrh is my Beloved unto me, I ſat under his Shadow with great Delight, and his Fruit was ſweet to my Taſte:</hi> Whereas before Converſion, their Deſires were chiefly and generally fixed either up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Honours, Profits, or Pleaſures of the preſent World; and conſequently their chief Delight placed in them.

               <hi>Sorrow</hi> is alſo changed, as to its Objects; they were wont in their carnal and ſecure State, to mourn about worldly Loſſes and Diſappointments, that either they could not acquire or keep ſuch a Quantity of worldly Subſtance, as their greedy Deſires longed for; or their Sorrow principally terminated upon the Loſs of their Credit, Relations, or Friends; but now they chiefly mourn over their own and others Sins, the Abſence of God, their Unfruitfulneſs in Religion, and the low State of it in the World; for <hi>he that is born of the Spirit, is Spirit,</hi> ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, i. e. he is ſpiritual in the Governing Frame and Temper of his Soul, and in the general Courſe of his Affections and Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The Affections are indeed the <hi>Pulſe</hi> of the Soul, by which we may know ſome Thing of its Temper and State, as we may of the Body by the Pulſe. (5.)

As they fear, ſo they hate it univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally and implacably, and cannot at any Time fall <hi>in Love</hi> with it as formerly; <hi>I

The ENJOYMENTS of Heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Viſion</hi> of God, <hi>Communion</hi> with him, and <hi>Conformity</hi> to him, you have a Temper of Heart directly contrary to, the near and conſtant View of your almighty Enemy, when all Hope of obtaining his Friendſhip expires, would create a great Diſguſt, and inſupportable Terror! and having no Principle of ſpiritual Life, you can have no <hi>reliſh</hi> for the proper <hi>Food</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and as for Holineſs, it is the Object of your Indignation (as was before obſerved) and in this you imitate the Nature of <hi>Devils!</hi> Nor is the <hi>Buſineſs</hi> of <hi>Heaven, viz.</hi> to <hi>praiſe God,</hi> and converſe with <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> more agreeable to your Taſte; for what Pleaſure can there be in Praiſe without Love? and what Delight in converſing with thoſe you hate, and that upon the diſagreeable Subject of <hi>Religion, Religion!</hi> and indeed the perpetual <hi>Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of this <hi>Happineſs,</hi> is the moſt dreadful and diſtreſſing Ingredient in it to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate; if it laſted but for a Day or ſo, it might be born with, though with a good

deal of Difficulty and Uneaſineſs; but that it ſhould laſt for ever, without any Hope of Relief, is a ſhocking Thought! to be obliged to behold an almighty incenſed Enemy for ever, without ſo much as Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to fly from his Preſence, for the leaſt Space of Time, is dreadful! to converſe with the deſpiſed Saints, a little now and then, about divine Things, even in this World, eſpecially if they have much of the Spirit and Savour of Piety, and deal faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with you, is a Burden which moſt of you dread, and therefore ſhun as much as you can; and when you can get handſomely clear of them, and come among your own Company, you are in your own <hi>Element,</hi> you breath freely and rejoice! how then could you endure to be among them for ever in Heaven, when they are made much more, diſagreeable to you, I mean holy and zealous, and converſe almoſt continually of that <hi>Religion,</hi> which you are ſo frequently ſick of now; and together therewith praiſe God, without a Moment's Intermiſſion, throughout a vaſt Eternity, without the leaſt Liberty to get among thoſe of your own Kidney, and talk about your Beloved, the <hi>World,</hi> even for one Moment? how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable would this be? juſt like the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Tyrant <hi>Mezentius,</hi> to tie a dead

Man to a Living! As to <hi>Communion</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> you do not underſtand it, and therefore do not really deſire it now (whatever you may pretend) becauſe according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb <hi>(Ignoti nulla Cupido)</hi> Of an unknown Thing there is no Deſire; and how then ſhould you deſire it in Heaven? nay, many of the Unconverted are ſtrongly prejudiced againſt it, and therefore give it bad Names, ſuch as <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> Diſorder, Diſtraction, and what not that is bad: The dry <hi>Form</hi> of Religion, you may poſſibly make a Shift to endure, but the <hi>Power</hi> and Spirit of it you cannot away with, it is an Abomination (to you.) Now what comfort can you have in the Thoughts either of being made an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Phanatic,</hi> againſt your Wills, or the <hi>Companion</hi> of ſuch for ever, whom ſome of you ſincerely contemn! That which ſtill bears harder upon you, if poſſible, is the <hi>Employment</hi> of <hi>Heaven, viz. praiſing God.</hi> As to <hi>public Worſhip</hi> in <hi>this Life,</hi> though Education, Cuſtom, and a hiſtorical Faith, may make ſome of you bear with a little of it tollerably, in caſe the Weather and Ways be good, and the preciſe Minute be duly obſerved, but if the uſual Minute be a little tranſgreſſed, then all is out of Joint; there is great Uneaſineſs, great Longing for the <hi>laſt Word,</hi> which is reckoned by far the beſt

that was ſpoken, and great <hi>Gladneſs</hi> after the Diſmiſſion of the Aſſembly, that you have once more got happily clear of this Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, this <hi>Confinement</hi> of worſhiping God, and have returned to a Buſineſs you like better! but pray are <hi>regular Folks,</hi> of ſuch <hi>puney Stomachs,</hi> fit to go to <hi>Heaven?</hi> or do you think to go there, and have any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort? if ſo, it is amazing; if you grow tired of a few Hours Worſhip in this Life, how will you bear to be tied to it, for Millions of Millions of Ages, and not have one ſpare Moment for the Buſineſs you love? O pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Caſe! in Heaven there is nothing at all ſuited to your preſent Temper, no <hi>worldly Riches</hi> to pleaſe your <hi>earthly Inclinations,</hi> no wanton Dalliances to gratify your brutiſh Deſires, no Parraſites to flatter your Vanity, none of the Seed of the Serpent to feed your Envy againſt God and his People, nothing but ſpiritual and holy Exerciſes and Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, in which, for the want of a pious Principle, you can have no more reliſh, than the Blind in Pictures, the Deaf in Muſick, or Brutes in the Mathematicks! you would be grated with its Harmony, ſad and ſorrowful in the Midſt of all its Joys, and perfectly tired with its inceſſant Devotions, as well as terrified with the Proſpect of their perpetual Continuance! in

this diſagreeable and diſtreſſing Situation, where you have nothing to your liking, you would long to be out from among a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and from Employments you never liked, and get into your own Element, and among your own Company! that you might have a little Liberty, and not be continually plagued with <hi>Religion;</hi> and ſeeing you could not get them any where elſe but in Hell, you would try to fly there for ſome Shelter, for ſome Comfort, after ſo much Sorrow and Trouble! and though HELL be a Place of terrible <hi>Torment,</hi> yet even there you would find ſome Mixture of comparative Comfort, for there you would be entirely delivered from converſing with thoſe you hate, and from the diſagreeable <hi>Exerciſes</hi> of <hi>Holineſs;</hi> there you would find <hi>Spirits</hi> of your own <hi>Complexion,</hi> and there you may without controul, in conſort with them, give free and full <hi>Vent</hi> to all your <hi>Reſentments</hi> againſt <hi>God,</hi> his <hi>Ways,</hi> and <hi>People</hi> for ever! thus it appears plainly, that <hi>Happineſs</hi> for you, in your <hi>preſent State,</hi> even in <hi>Heaven itſelf,</hi> is <hi>impoſſible,</hi> from the very <hi>Nature</hi> of Things, according to the Dictates of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>common Senſe;</hi> and that either GOD, or you, muſt have your Natures changed, or you cannot agree together, and

            <p n="2">2. To the Teſtimony of Reaſon, <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> gives its <hi>Suffrage;</hi> by informing us that we are by Nature in a corrupted State, <hi>John</hi> 3.6. and likewiſe that we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned both by the Law, and by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, for violating the one, and refuſing the Offers of the other (<hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16.) it cannot be that any unconverted Perſon has Faith of a ſaving Kind, for that would Change his Heart and Practice, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. Now there never was any Way opened to Heaven, but theſe two, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Works of the Law, and by the Goſpel, both which are ſhut up to the Unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate: That God, who is abſolute Lord of his own Treaſures, and can diſpenſe them to his Creatures, upon what Terms he pleaſes, has by poſitive Conſtitution made Converſion, or Holineſs, which are but different Words for the ſame Thing, of abſolute Neceſſity to Salvation, <hi>John</hi> 3.3. <hi>Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto him, verily, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, I ſay unto thee, except a Man be born again, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God. Heb.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Without Holineſs no Man ſhall ſee the Lord; without this, neither Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, nor Uncircumciſion, will avail any Thing to Salvation (Gal.</hi> 6.15.) and indeed, it
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:008266_0269_102E538DABD6E298"/>
may be with Juſtice aſſerted, that Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion has ſuch a Relation to, and Connection with future Happineſs, that it is but a Part, or Beginning of it, differing only in <hi>Degree</hi> and <hi>Duration,</hi> from the Happineſs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; for what is that, but the Perfection of the Graces, formed and infuſed in this Life, and the Continuance and Perfection of that Communion with God, and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Worſhip which is here begun, ſome Circumſtances excepted? The good Man moſt certainly begins his Heaven upon Earth, and finiſhes there what is imperfect here.</p>
            <p>BUT it is Time to proceed to ſome brief IMPROVEMENT of this very important Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; ſeeing the Matter is of ſo great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Neceſſity, upon which our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Safety, in both World's depend; it is therefore highly Neceſſary, to examine with Speed, Care, and Impartiality, the preſent State of our Souls, by comparing our Experiences in Religion with what has been already ſaid in this Diſcourſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Nature of a gracious Change, upon the ſeveral Powers and Paſſions of the Soul, together with the conſequent Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation upon the outward Conduct. It is true, in the preceeding Sermon, I ſhewed that there may be ſome Alteration made
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:008266_0270_102E5390443C9070"/>
upon ſome, or all the Faculties of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate; but that is very defective, and very different from the Change which I have been now diſcourſing of, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to every Eye, by the following Hints (which I offer, to prevent truly pious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from being diſtreſſed, without juſt Cauſe, reſpecting the State of their Souls) e. g. the Light in their <hi>Minds</hi> puffs up, and is attended with Sloth, whereas the other habitually humbles the Soul, and excites to practical Holineſs. The Reſolutions of the <hi>Wills</hi> of the Unregenerate, are not humble, preſent, fixed, and thorough; they are not fully determined to forſake every Sin, and to do every Duty; No! they except <hi>Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution Sins,</hi> and ſuch <hi>Duties</hi> as are <hi>unfaſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, difficult,</hi> and <hi>dangerous</hi> to <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood;</hi> but it is the very reverſe with the Regenerate: The <hi>Will</hi> of the <hi>Unconverted,</hi> not being <hi>thoroughly turned</hi> from Sin and Self-righteouſneſs to God, in Jeſus Chriſt, makes a Flaw in the Marriage Contract, and ſo ruins all! But the <hi>Regenerate</hi> being ſlain by the Law, are <hi>honeſt,</hi> and have no <hi>reſerve</hi> in their <hi>Cloſure</hi> with the <hi>Redeemer,</hi> but gladly accept of him, as the Gift of <hi>God,</hi> in all his <hi>Offices,</hi> under a deep Senſe of their abſolute Need of him in them all, with a full and firm Purpoſe, by his gracious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:008266_0271_102E53969374A2F8"/>
to cleave to him and his Ways to the <hi>Death,</hi> though it ſhould coſt them ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo dear. As to the <hi>Change</hi> in the <hi>Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> before expreſſed, this is obſervable, that they do not <hi>alter</hi> the <hi>governing Frame</hi> and habitual <hi>Temper</hi> of the <hi>Soul,</hi> and make it holy, humble, heavenly; whereas the other really does ſo, <hi>he that is born of the Fleſh, is Fleſh, and he that is born of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is Spirit,</hi> ſaith our dear Lord. The <hi>Regenerate make Conſcience</hi> of their <hi>Thoughts,</hi> they likewiſe labour to preſerve the <hi>Savour</hi> of Religion in their Hearts, and to live by <hi>leaning</hi> on <hi>Chriſt;</hi> Sin is their chief <hi>Burden</hi> and <hi>Progreſs</hi> in <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Uſefulneſs,</hi> their <hi>chief Deſire</hi> in general, really and truly; but it is not ſo with the Unconverted, their Thoughts are ſuffered to run at random, nor do they mind the Savour of Piety, if they can but keep up the <hi>Form,</hi> they are likewiſe Strangers to daily living on the Offices of Chriſt, nor are they truly bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened with their Heart-Corruption, their Unprofitableneſs, and little Growth in Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for their Religion is principally cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated for the <hi>Meridian</hi> of this World: The inward Part with them is a ſorry Thing, a mere Flaſh! let ſuch who have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced this gracious Change deſcribed in this Sermon, <hi>rejoice</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> whatever your out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:008266_0272_102E5398153536E8"/>
Situalion is, becauſe being by Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion made his <hi>Children,</hi> in a ſaving Senſe, they may with Certainty expect all the <hi>Bowels</hi> and <hi>Aſſiſtance,</hi> which a <hi>Father</hi> ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

            <p>DEAR BRETHREN, let us therefore live Lives of Thankſgiving and Praiſe to the Glory of God, for this Work of his Grace in us, and all other Benefits we have and do receive from his bounteous Hands; in particular, let us glorify God, by a <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> in his dear <hi>Son,</hi> and faithful <hi>Word; not ſtaggering at the Promiſe;</hi> by a <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> to his Majeſty, our heavenly <hi>Father,</hi> and to his <hi>Children,</hi> our <hi>Brethren;</hi> by a <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Holineſs, Learning of Jeſus, to be meek and lowly in Heart; let us be Followers of God, as dear Children, and walk in Love,</hi> imitating the imitable Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of our great and gracious Father, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to be holy, as he is holy, and merciful, as he is merciful: And as to the Unconverted, I beſeech you, by the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of GOD, to pity your poor Souls, and

            <p>IN the preceeding Sermon, after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the indiſpenſable Neceſſity of a general Reformation of Manners, to ſave our Country and Nation from impending Ruin: I propoſed ſome <hi>expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory Queries,</hi> reſpecting the Unreaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of perſiſting in Sin, and in particular laboured to ſhew the Baſeneſs of <hi>delaying Converſion,</hi> by obſerving that it is <hi>diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> to <hi>God, hurtful</hi> to <hi>others,</hi> and <hi>prejudicial</hi> to <hi>yourſelves;</hi> the two former Particulars have been already ſpoken to.</p>
            <p>I now proceeed to ſay, that <hi>Delays</hi> in the grand Buſineſs of <hi>Converſion,</hi> are pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly <hi>prejudicial</hi> to yourſelves, for they are

contrary to the <hi>Practice</hi> of good People, <hi>inconſiſtent, diſingenous, fooliſh,</hi> and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>perilous.</hi> The Pſalmiſt's Practice was of a very different Kind, <hi>I made haſte, and delayed not,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>to keep thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> Farther,</p>
            <p>A <hi>Purpoſe</hi> of <hi>defering</hi> Converſion and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, is <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> with a Purpoſe to repent; becauſe it implies a Reſolution to continue in Sin for a Time, which is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Rebellion</hi> and <hi>Hypocriſy;</hi> and yet upon this Foundation, do many make their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences eaſy, and hope for Happineſs; the Language of which Practice is, I will turn to God, when I have finiſhed Buſineſs of greater Conſequence, i. e. gratified my Luſts, or made an Eſtate; I'll ſerve God when I have got nothing elſe to do, or when I can hardly turn upon my Bed; ſhameful Speech!

them, that they diſapproved of a gay Dreſs, in a Time of public Mourning. <hi>Non eſt conveniens</hi> (ſaith one of them) <hi>Luctibus, ille color;</hi> But when they became Chriſtians, they quit them altogether, at all Times, and followed a very different Rule, <hi>viz.

            <p>BUT deferring Converſion, is not only hypocritical, but <hi>diſingenuous;</hi> ſuppoſing you could be certain of obtaining it at laſt, it would be baſe and diſingenuous to treat the Almighty ſo, as it is not lawful to treat our fellow Creatures, and ſo as we would not have God to treat us, as the wiſe Man ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, <hi>we muſt not ſay to our Neighbour, go and come again, and To-morrow I will give, when thou haſt it by thee.</hi> Our Deſire of God, is that he would hear us immediately, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 102.2. <hi>Incline thine Ear unto me in the Day when I call, anſwer me ſpeedily;</hi> and ſhall we uſe Delays with our Sovereign, in a Matter of Life and Death? But if ye wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:008266_0293_102E53D09BC60FC8"/>
defer Converſion to the laſt, you are ſo far from a Certainty or Probability of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Mercy, that there is great Hazard of being denied; conſider what God himſelf ſays upon this Head, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24,—28. Farther,</p>
            <p>DELAYS in Matters of eternal Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, are the Height of <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> would he not act like a diſtracted Man, who was bit with a Rattle-Snake, and would tarry ſome conſiderable Time, before he ſent for a Phyſician? is not ſuch a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon a Self-Murderer, as well as a Madman? and if he dies by this Delay, is not his Blood upon his own Head? The melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly Caſe eaſily applies itſelf, if you will not ſhut your Eyes, your Ears, your Hearts, which if you do, it is againſt your own Life! Again,</p>
            <p>DELAYS in the Buſineſs of Salvation, are exceeding <hi>perilous,</hi> and that on many Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts; hereby the <hi>Number</hi> of our <hi>Iniquities</hi> is <hi>increaſed,</hi> for one Sin naturally leads to, and diſpoſes for the Commiſſion of another; thus an awful Increaſe of Guilt is brought upon our miſerable Souls, as if we had not enough already, whoſe Iniquities rival the Stars for Multitude, and are red as Crimſon in their Aggravations! hereby the <hi>Heart</hi>
               <pb n="257" facs="unknown:008266_0294_102E53D38FC959F0"/>
is <hi>hardened,</hi> a ſinful Cuſtom introduced, and vicious Habits ſtrengthened; whereby we are rendered more averſe to God and all Goodneſs, more prone to every Iniquity, and, of Conſequence, Converſion rendered more hard and difficult. (<hi>Jer.</hi> 13.23.) <hi>Can the Ethiopian change his Skin, and the Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard his Spots, then may ye alſo learn to do Good, who are accuſtomed to do Evil!</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is <hi>grieved</hi> and quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by whoſe Influence Sinners are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of Sin, and converted from it; and the Saints ſealed to the Day of Redemption (<hi>Pſ.</hi> 95.78, 11.) <hi>To-Day if you will hear his Voice, harden not your Hearts, as in the Provocation</hi> (i. e. by Delays and Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in Sin) <hi>to whom I ſware in my Wrath, that they ſhould not enter into my Reſt.</hi> O ſhocking Sentence! tremble at it you delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Impenitents, for it may be ſoon your own diſmal Caſe! pray obſerve, that <hi>late Repentance</hi> is <hi>ſeldom genuine,</hi> there is but one Example of this in the holy Scriptures, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the <hi>Thief</hi> upon the Croſs; but one that none ſhould preſume, and yet there is one that none ſhould deſpair; nor can it be proved, that he was acquainted with the Chriſtian Religion long before, and deferred his Repentance, with the View of obtaining

Mercy at laſt <note n="*" place="bottom">Beſides in the Time of Chriſt's <hi>Abaſure,</hi> miraculous Works were wrought to demonſtrate his Divinity, among which this may be called one.</note>. O! let delaying Sinners read, and conſider that awful Scripture, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.48. <hi>ad finem. But if that evil Servant ſhall ſay in his Heart, my Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layeth his coming, and ſhall begin to ſmite his fellow Servants, and to eat and drink with the Drunken, the Lord of that Servant, ſhall come in a Day when he looketh not for him, and in an Hour that he is not aware of, and ſhall cut him aſunder, and appoint him his Portion with the Hypocrites, there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth!</hi> Once more,</p>
            <p>DELAYS are exſtreamly <hi>perilous,</hi> becauſe of a three-fold Uncertainty, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> of the <hi>Means</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> and of a <hi>divine Bleſſing</hi> upon thoſe <hi>Means!</hi> What is your <hi>Life,</hi> but a <hi>Vapour,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> with equal Truth and Beauty obſerves, <hi>which appears for a little Time, and then vaniſheth away;</hi> and therefore <hi>we ſhould work while the Day laſts, for the Night comes, wherein no Man can work?</hi> This ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Meſſenger will ſoon wrap us in its ſable <hi>Shades,</hi> and bury us in Darkneſs, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>activity, and Oblivion; and therefore <hi>what our Hands find to do,</hi> eſpecially of a religious Kind, <hi>let us do it with all our Might, ſeeing
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:008266_0296_102E53D8C8144C60"/>
there is no Work, Device, or Invention, in the Grave, whither we are all haſtening;</hi> every Moment we are upon the Verge of a vaſt Eternity, and know not what a Day, an Hour, a Minute may bring forth; we may never live to ſee the next Morning's Light, do not therefore depend on your young Years, heat of Blood, and Strength of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; what are theſe to withſtand the Force of Sickneſs and Death? Do you not ſee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of your Years removed to Eternity, who were as likely to live as you, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably expected to live to advanced Age as much as you do? But they were diſappointed of their Hopes, and may not you alſo? And will not the Diſappointment be fatal and dreadful, if you continue to delay? Do not ſome die in the Bitterneſs of their Souls, ſome when their Breaſts are full of Milk, and their Bones moiſtened with Marrow; ſome, though few, in the Wane of Life, when Age has ſnowed upon them; and by far the greater Number in the opening Dawn, or full Bloom of Life, when their Souls are big with ſecular Expectations and Deſigns, which the Foot of Death cruſhes in an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant! And though Life gradually waſtes away in ſome, by chronical Diſtempers, like a Candle expiring in the Socket, yet are not many ſnatched off the Stage of Time,

into the inviſible World, ſuddenly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly, both to themſelves and others, either by accute Diſeaſes, or ſurprizing Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, with which we are all continually environed, and from which none can with Certainty, promiſe themſelves an Exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! Now, is it wiſe and diſcreet, my young Friends, to venture your eternal All, upon ſuch a dreadful Uncertainty? O! for God's Sake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> think ſeriouſly upon this before it be too late! But to proceed,</p>
            <p>ARE not the <hi>Means</hi> of <hi>Grace uncertain</hi> alſo, in reſpect of their Continuance with us? And does not this Truth appear in a ſtriking and awful Light at this Time, when the holy and dreadful GOD is threatning by his Providence, to take them entirely away from us for ever, for our ungrateful Slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, and to leave us under the <hi>Curſe</hi> of <hi>Papal</hi> or <hi>Pagan Darkneſs!</hi> O there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>while we have the Light, let us walk in it: We the Ambaſſadors of Chriſt, beſeech you alſo, that you would not receive the Grace of God in vain.</hi> And is not a <hi>Bleſſing</hi> on the <hi>Means</hi> equally <hi>uncertain,</hi> in caſe we <hi>delay?</hi> Converſion is God's Gift (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26.) which he confers in his own appointed Time and Way, not according to our Pleaſure; and therefore we ſhould improve every Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, and gracious Motion we are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured

with; for if we will not with Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs perform the outward Duties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion while we can, it is juſt that we ſhall not when we would; and indeed this is what you delaying Sinners have Reaſon to fear, for <hi>God's Spirit will not always ſtrive with Man; call therefore upon God while he is near, and ſeek him while he may be found, leſt he ſay to you as to Ephraim, Ephraim is joined to Idols, let him alone.</hi> If God takes away his holy Spirit from you, which you are in Danger of every Hour while you delay, your Caſe is moſt miſerable and hopeleſs, it had been better for you, that you had never been born.</p>
            <p>YOUR <hi>Delaying</hi> looks like a <hi>Suſpence</hi> of Mind which Maſter to chooſe. <hi>Why Halt ye between two Opinions?</hi> Are ye at a Loſs to determine which is the beſt Maſter, GOD or the Devil, which the beſt Work, Sin or Holineſs, which the beſt Wages, Heaven or Hell? If not, what mean ye by your Delays? Can that which is of abſolute <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity</hi> be done too ſoon? Are you ever like to have eaſier Terms? Is not God as amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble now as ever he will be, Holineſs as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and excellent, your Souls as precious, the Love of Chriſt as ſweet, and Heaven as valuable? If therefore you do ever intend to turn to GOD, do not play the <hi>Hypocrite:</hi>

Turn now, or give up Salvation for ever! <hi>Rejoice, O young Man, in thy Youth, and let thy Heart chear thee in the Days of thy Youth, and walk in the Ways of thy Heart, and in the Sight of thine Eyes,</hi> take thy Swing, and follow thy vicious Inclinations, <hi>but know thou, that for all theſe Things, God will bring thee into Judgment!</hi> But to proceed,</p>
            <p>MAY not the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of <hi>Converſion,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite you to ſeek after it? Ye can neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold God here, by an Eye of Faith, or enjoy him hereafter without it, as our Lord po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively aſſures us, it is of abſolute Neceſſity to future Happineſs, both from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of God, and the Nature of Things; <hi>without Holineſs no Man ſhall ſee the Lord (Heb.</hi> 12.14.) This is <hi>the one Thing needful, which whoſoever chooſeth, poſſeſſeth not only the beſt, but the moſt neceſſary Part;</hi> it is certain God is holy, otherwiſe he could not be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely perfect, and ſo no God; and it is as certain, that we muſt be like him in Holineſs, elſe we can have no Complacence in him, or he in us; for between Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, inſtead of Harmony, there is Diſcord and Oppoſition; without this therefore, we muſt give up all Hopes of Happineſs for ever. May I not Addreſs you, in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of CHRIST to <hi>Martha, Luke</hi> 10.41, 42. <hi>Martha, Martha, thou art careful and
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:008266_0300_102E53DC6B9A1048"/>
troubled about many Things, but one Thing is needful.</hi> And, SIRS,</p>
            <p>MAY not the <hi>Excellency</hi> of <hi>Converſion,</hi> excite our Eſteem of it, and Deſire after it; this reſtores the defaced <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in us, which is the <hi>Beauty</hi> of our <hi>reaſonable Nature,</hi> to ſome Degree of its primitive Luſtre, and thereby capacitates us to anſwer the Deſign of our Being, which is to ſerve and enjoy our Creator and Redeemer, without this we muſt be unprofitable here, and miſerable hereafter: If Holineſs be the Beauty of God himſelf, it muſt of Conſequence be ours, ſeeing it is our higheſt Excellency to imitate him; but that it is ſo, appears from the Precept, to <hi>Worſhip him in the Beauties of Holineſs,</hi> and his Title, <hi>glorious in Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> Add to this, the <hi>Profitableneſs</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,</hi> which ſhould be a ſufficient Motive to labour for it; this advances us to the higheſt <hi>Honours,</hi> and inſtates us in the moſt laſting <hi>Benefits;</hi> for hereby <hi>Jehovah,</hi> who is the Fountain of Honour, becomes our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Lord JESUS CHRIST our Huſband, the Cherubims and Seraphims, our Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants and Guard, and the Church trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant and militant, our Brethren; is it a Matter of no Moment, for poor polluted Duſt, Heirs of Hell and Wrath, to be clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from their Deformity, and made the
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:008266_0301_102E53DDEDE976B8"/>
Sons of a King, nay to be made Kings and Prieſts to God? Does not the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> ſpeak with juſt Surprize, of this Privilege! 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.1. <hi>Behold what Manner of Love the Father has beſtowed upon us, that we ſhould be called the Sons of God!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ANOTHER Excitement to ſeek <hi>Converſion,</hi> is the <hi>Safety</hi> it brings Perſons to; all ſuch have God to be their Shield and Sanctuary, their ſure <hi>Refuge,</hi> and exceeding great <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;</hi> and who then can hurt them, or make them afraid? How ſecure and pleaſant muſt their repoſe be? But before this Change, you are in Danger of utter De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction every Minute, and have no Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to cover you from the Vengeance of an angry God. In fine, the <hi>Pleaſure</hi> conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent upon <hi>Converſion,</hi> ſhould invite Sinners to labour for it; as the regenerated Perſon's Life is the ſafeſt, ſo it is the ſweeteſt Life! (<hi>Prov.</hi> 3.17.) <hi>Wiſdom's Ways are Ways of Pleaſantneſs, Chriſt's Yoke is eaſy, and his Burden light.</hi> It is true, Difficulty and Pain are endured before Converſion, but when the <hi>Bias</hi> of the Heart is turned towards God and Holineſs, and it feels the Power of a Saviour's Love, he goes on his Way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing, for it muſt needs be agreeable to act according to the ſettled Bent of the Soul; and their <hi>Joy</hi> is <hi>rational, ſpiritual,
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:008266_0302_102E53DF70317E70"/>
peaceful, perpetual!</hi> It is <hi>rational</hi> and <hi>ſolid,</hi> ariſing from and confirmed by Conſideration and Reflection, and therefore ſuitable to the Soul, which is the Seat and Fountain of Reaſon; whereas the Pleaſures of Sin are but a <hi>Flaſh,</hi> the reſult of a cruel <hi>Rape</hi> upon the Underſtanding by Senſe; which according to the Order of God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhould be its Subject. This <hi>Joy</hi> is alſo <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> proceeding from the Father of Spirits, and ſo adapted to the Soul, which is of an immaterial Nature; but the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Sin are groſs and ſenſual, only ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to gratify the lower Paſſions and Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, which Beaſts poſſeſs in common with Men. Farther,</p>
            <p>IT is <hi>peaceful;</hi> the <hi>Paths of Wiſdom are Peace,</hi> as well as <hi>Pleaſure;</hi> whereas thoſe of Sin, though they gratify a brutal Paſſion, do produce Pain and Diſorder, and hence it is truly ſaid, that <hi>the Way of Tranſgreſſors is hard, they are like the troubled Sea, that caſteth forth Mire and Dirt!</hi> Once more,</p>
            <p>THIS <hi>Joy</hi> is <hi>perpetual,</hi> at leaſt in State and Habit; <hi>Light is ſown for the Righteous,</hi> whereas the ſtolen Pleaſures of Sin, cannot be reflected on without Shame and Horror, unleſs by Men of reprobate Minds, and ſeared Conſciences. (<hi>Rom.</hi> 6.11.) <hi>What Profit had ye in thoſe Things, of which ye are
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:008266_0303_102E53E322F4D658"/>
now aſhamed, for the End of theſe Things is Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Joys</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> are peculiar and noble, in this, that they antidote all our <hi>Fears,</hi> and equal our vaſt <hi>Deſires</hi> and <hi>Hopes;</hi> being fully perſwaded, upon a good Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, that the <hi>Creator</hi> and <hi>Lord</hi> of the Univerſe, is our cordial, immutable, and immortal <hi>Friend,</hi> and that he has under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to over-rule all for our Good in Time, and to introduce us into his glorious Preſence at laſt, where is Fulneſs of Delight for ever; of whom, or of what ſhould we be afraid, having ſuch Security? <hi>ſhall we fear Man, whoſe Breath is in his Noſtrils, whoſe Foundation is in the Duſt, and who is cruſhed before the Moth?</hi> No! <hi>we need not fear, though Ten Thouſand riſe up againſt us;</hi> ſhall we be ſlaviſhly afraid of awful <hi>Phoeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menons,</hi> in any Parts of inanimate Nature, or at any <hi>Preſages,</hi> or actual Beginnings of <hi>Revolutions</hi> in Kingdoms and Nations? No! <hi>God is our Refuge and Strength, a very preſent Help in Trouble; therefore we will not fear, though the Earth be removed, and the Mountains be carried into the Midſt of the Sea, yea though the Waters thereof roar and be troubled.</hi>

            <p>IN the two preceeding Diſcourſes, I firſt conſidered this Text in its primary View, as relating to temporal Miſeries, and afterwards in its Secondary, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting Eternal; and in order to excite Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to ſeek Converſion, I endeavoured to expoſtulate with them, by the following Arguments, <hi>viz. eternal Death, eternal Life,</hi> the <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> the <hi>Excellency</hi> of <hi>Converſion,</hi> the <hi>Advantages, Safety,</hi> and <hi>Sweetneſs</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent upon it, together with the great Unreaſonableneſs, and manifold Dangers of <hi>Delays,</hi> in a Matter of ſuch vaſt Moment!

<pb n="268" facs="unknown:008266_0305_102E53E9D6CF66B8"/>
both to Sinners and Saints: Here obſerve, that before Converſion, Sinners are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. UNPROFITABLE and <hi>loſt Creatures, Philem.</hi> 1.11. <hi>which in Time paſt was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, but now profitable to thee and me:</hi> Here it is evident, that the Unregenerate are unprofitable, they anſwer not the great End of their Being and Relations; they are in a Manner good for Nothing, Cumberers of the Ground, the very Lumber of the Creation; <hi>Luke</hi> 15.4. <hi>This my Son was loſt.</hi> Ye are <hi>loſt</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> he has not that Honour and Service from you, which is due; but in Place thereof, Diſobedience and Reproach!

            <p>IN the Forenoon's Sermon, I laboured to perſwade Sinners to turn to GOD, by ſhewing that the Unregenerate are loſt, ſinful, and miſerable Creatures; that God is the Center of the Soul, that ſeeking Converſion to him, is your own Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, a Buſineſs of the greateſt Moment, a Buſineſs which it is your greateſt Wiſdom to negotiate; that the Almighty gives great Encouragement to thoſe that are ſincerely engaged therein, and that your Converſion would cauſe Joy in Heaven, and on Earth.

Small Matters would not keep People from hearing, as they do now, nor were they ſoon tired, though the Diſcourſe was a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle longer then uſual; no, they were all Attention, all Deſire, all Delight! But alas, this harveſt Seaſon is paſt and over, and yet many of you are not ſaved; <hi>the Bellows are burnt, the Lead is conſumed of the Fire, the Founder melteth in vain;</hi> all Means uſed to reform you are to no Purpoſe, though the Inſtruments are waſted in their Work; and is there no Reaſon to fear the awful Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, threatned in the latter Part of the Words referred to, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.29, 30. <hi>Reprobate Silver ſhall Men call them, becauſe the Lord hath rejected them!</hi> If you continue to ſlight

all the Warnings and Invitations given, you are worſe in ſome Reſpects than <hi>Jews,</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domites, and Devils; for the <hi>Jews</hi> and Sodomites had not ſuch Light as ye enjoy, and the Devils never had an Offer of Mercy after their Apoſtacy, which you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly been favoured with, but to no Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.28, 29. <hi>He that diſpiſed Moſes's Law died without Mercy, under two or three Witneſſes, of how much ſorer Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſuppoſe ye ſhall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under Foot the Son of God; Mat.</hi> 11.23, 24. <hi>And thou Capernaum which art exalted unto Heaven, ſhall be brought down to Hell.</hi>

the Friendſhip and Protection of a God of infinite Power, or to forſake that which is the Diſhonour of your reaſonable Nature, and Poiſon of your immortal Souls? O Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, what hinders your Compliance with the Invitations of Heaven? Sin is pleaſant; true ſome Sins do pleaſe the Senſes, but their Fruits here, and in Hell are bitter, beſides theſe Pleaſures are tranſitory, mean, and brutiſh, but thoſe of Religion noble and permanent. I ſhall be cenſured by my Relations and Neighbours, what then, theſe groundleſs Reproached will turn to your Honour and Benefit, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.29. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.10, 11, 12.</p>
            <p>THE Sufferings of this preſent Life are light, and but for a Moment, not worthy to be compared with the exceeding great and eternal Weight of Glory in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, which is reſerved for thoſe that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely Love and ſerve God. I ſhall loſe ſome worldly Advantage by the Profeſſion and Practice of Religion. <hi>A.</hi> And what if you do, it will be infinitely more than made up to you, by the Love and Favour of GOD here and hereafter! Why then do not you Endeavour, poor Sinners, to turn to God? Why will you prefer any temporal Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, before the Safety of your Souls?

Why ſtand ye ſo careleſs and indolent on the Shore of a vaſt Eternity, not knowing but the next Tide will ſweep you off, beyond all Hopes of a Remedy, and ſink you in the dark Retreats of Death?

and Sloth, we ſhall periſh; come then let us go to God, in Chriſt, for converting Grace, he can but deny us, we can but periſh: But if he has Mercy upon us, we ſhall live, live eternally.

            <p>I PROCEED to offer ſome Directions to Sinners and Saints, agreeable to the Order before propoſed, O be intreated to ſeek Converſion, in the following Manner.</p>
            <p n="1">1. EARLY, <hi>Ecleſ.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Remember now thy Creator in the Days of thy Youth, while the evil Days come not, nor the Years draw nigh, in which thou wilt ſay, I have no Pleaſure;</hi> endeavour to fear, love, and ſerve GOD, with all thy Heart, in young Years, for he is the Author of thy Life and Being, and of all thy Benefits; to him thou art under the ſtrongeſt Obligations, and upon him thou haſt a continual Dependence: As Youth is
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:008266_0347_102E5459499A2910"/>
moſt ſuſceptive of religious Impreſſions, ſo it is beſt fitted for the Performance of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Offices; and as thou oweſt the beſt of thy Time and Strength to God, the Giver of both, the Improvement thereof in his Service, will be moſt acceptable to him, and moſt comfortable to thee; This is the beſt Proviſion for old Age, one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Comforts of which, is the Remembrance of a well ſpent Youth: Age has enough to do with itſelf, theſe are Years in which we have no Pleaſure, then with <hi>Barſilai,</hi> we cannot reliſh the Delights of Senſe, and in the mean Time, are loaded with bodily In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities; our Strength becomes Labour and Sorrow, and we feel ourſelves die by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. It is ungrateful to give the Flower of our Days to the Devil, and reſerve the Bran for God, this is to offer the Torn, the Lame, and the Sick in Sacrifice, for which a Curſe is denounced, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.14.</p>
            <p n="2">2. YOU ſhould ſeek Converſion to GOD <hi>earneſtly,</hi> as the poor Woman the loſt Piece of Silver, the Lord JESUS CHRIST could not Purchaſe our Happineſs without great Labour and Agony, and why ſhould we think to get an Intereſt in it without Pains? We are enjoined to <hi>ſtrive to enter in at the ſtreight Gate,</hi> or to agonize into it, and informed, that <hi>many ſhall ſeek to enter, and
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:008266_0348_102E545BE6046430"/>
ſhall not be able;</hi> i. e. doubtleſs becauſe they do not take Pains enough! The <hi>Gate</hi> of <hi>Converſion,</hi> by which we enter into the Way of true Holineſs, is <hi>ſtreight,</hi> it is hard to find, and therefore few find it, becauſe it is above Nature, and only revealed to ſome, by God the Father: (<hi>Mat.</hi> 13.11.) It is likewiſe hard to be entered into, for this is contrary to Nature; the <hi>Way</hi> of Holineſs is <hi>narrow,</hi> both in reſpect of Sin and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo narrow that it will not hold a Man and unmortified Sin together; unleſs we pluck out our Right-Eye, and cut off our Right-Arm, we muſt be loſt for ever: It is alſo an afflicted Way, <hi>through many Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations we muſt enter into the Kingdom of God;</hi> and indeed the Travellers in this Way are <hi>few (Luke</hi> 12.32.) <hi>Though the Number of Iſrael be as the Sand of the Sea, but a Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is ſaved (Rom.</hi> 11.7.) <hi>Many are called, but few choſen.</hi> Add to this, that many and powerful Enemies, endeavour to hinder us in this Work, <hi>viz.</hi> the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, which muſt be contended with; and indeed the Salvation which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion makes us meet for, is of ſo great Moment, and of ſuch abſolute Neceſſity, that it deſerves the greateſt Care and Pains.</p>
            <p n="3">3. HUMBLY be perſwaded, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of any Thing you have done, or
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:008266_0349_102E545D8FAB2F48"/>
can do, ye are unprofitable Servants, and that the Lord may juſtly caſt you off for ever; till you be brought to this, you are not proper Objects of Mercy, you have no ſuitable Eſteem of it, nor are you diſpoſed to give to God due Glory for it: <hi>The Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry ſhall be filled with good Things, but the Rich, the Full</hi> in their own Eyes, <hi>ſhall be ſent empty away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. YOU ſhould ſeek converting Grace <hi>conſtantly,</hi> until you obtain it (<hi>Luke</hi> 15.8.) a Perſon ſtarving with Hunger would not be contented with aſking for Bread, unleſs he got what he aſked; bare Begging would not ſatisfy the Cravings of his hungry Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach: So neither ſhould ye be ſatisfied with praying for Converſion, till you get what ye pray for, nor ſhould you be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged becauſe you obtain not the Anſwer of your Prayers, ſo ſoon as you expected, or do deſire, for the Almighty acts as a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, in diſpenſing his Grace to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men, to ſome he gives it ſooner, and to others later, juſt as he pleaſes; his Time we ought to wait for with Diligence, Patience, and Hope, for it is certainly the beſt Time, and his Mercy, when obtained, will ſufficiently recompence our Pains and Patience in queſt of it, and waiting for it! Do not give over ſtriving and hoping, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:008266_0350_102E545F118E1460"/>
Things ſeem to grow worſe with you than before Conviction; for this is owing partly to that new Light of God's Spirit, through his Law, now given you, which diſcovers that Heart-Wickedneſs which you were ignorant of before; the more this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes, the more you ſee of your own Vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, from whence you are induced, though without Foundation, to conclude it grows in you, when it is only your View of it; ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20. <hi>The Law entered, that the Offence might abound.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BESIDES, <hi>Satan</hi> with a malicious Deſign to diſcourage you, tries by the Law to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage inward Corruption, and to bring it into Act more than ever before, ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.8. <hi>Sin taking Occaſion by the Commandment, wrought in me all Manner of Concupicence, for without the Law, Sin was dead.</hi> While Sinners remain in a State of Blindneſs and Security, and pleaſe themſelves with Dreams of their preſent Goodneſs, and future Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, he lets them alone politically, for he knows while they remain ſo, he is ſure of them, and that if he tempted them, as he does thoſe that are convinced, they would be probably frightened out of their Sleep, and he in Danger of loſing them; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore encourages their falſe Hopes, and if they get Half awakened, he labours with
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:008266_0351_102E5460937863E8"/>
all his Might to lull them a-ſleep again, by high Encomiums upon their Goodneſs, ſuch as theſe, that they <hi>mean well, never wronged any</hi> of a <hi>Penny</hi> in their Lives, are much <hi>better</hi> than many of their <hi>Neighbours,</hi> and ſuch like; and that there is no need of ſuch Soul <hi>Diſtreſs,</hi> that if they give way to it, it will perhaps hurt their <hi>Credit,</hi> their <hi>Senſes,</hi> their worldly <hi>Intereſt,</hi> and it may be, bring them to an untimely <hi>End:</hi> But if they get ſo wounded, that he cannot bring them back to their former Security, then he tries all the Arts he is Maſter of, to drive them to <hi>Deſpair,</hi> ſome of which are ſuch as theſe, he ſuggeſts, 1ſt, That it is now worſe than ever, that God is more provoked. <hi>A.</hi> It is falſe, you are now in the Way to Mercy, and never were before; ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. 2d. He ſays, that no Body ever had ſuch a wicked Heart, ſince the Foundation of the World, as you; never any Body ſinned ſo in Life, nor was ever any in ſuch ſtrange Circumſtances. <hi>A.</hi> This is the Teſtimony of the Father of Lies, who was a Murderer from the Beginning, <hi>as Face anſwers Face in a Glaſs, ſo does the Heart of one Man ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> The Almighty has graciouſly left upon Record in his Word, divers Inſtances of glorious Grace, vouchſafed to the vileſt of Sinners, on purpoſe to confute this cruel
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:008266_0352_102E5465A85F3C50"/>
Stratagem of the Enemy of Souls, and to manifeſt and magnify the exceeding Riches of his Grace, e. g. <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> a Murderer, a Conjurer, who ſlighted God in Proſperity, obtained Mercy; and ſo did <hi>Saul,</hi> a Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor, <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> a Harlot, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, unrighteous <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous <hi>Epheſians,</hi> yea, and even thoſe that actually embrued their Hands in the Blood of our dear Lord, were waſhed by the Blood they ſhed, from their Guilt in ſhedding of it! But ſuppoſing your Sins were greater in reality than the Sins of any other, there is no reaſon to deſpair of God's Mercy, in caſe you endeavour to repent and believe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>it is not according to Works of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs that we have done, but according to his Mercy that he ſaves us:</hi> The Blood of Chriſt is of infinite Value, and cleanſes from all Sin, and ſurely Sin cannot be of more than infinite Guilt: The greater our Iniquities are, the more the Riches of God's Grace will be magnified in pardoning them, and this indeed is the great Deſign of the Goſpel Method of Salvation, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1, 5, 6. 3d, He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects blaſphemous Thoughts into their Minds, in a thick Succeſſion, which they try to get rid of, but cannot; now Satan artfully and falſly labours to father thoſe Brats of his malicious Brood upon the Convinced, with
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:008266_0353_102E54672DCA2B00"/>
deſign to drive them to Diſpair or Diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and they, poor Things, are too apt, through Ignorance, to give Way to the Charge, to their own great Prejudice: But Friends, <hi>put on the Shield of Faith, whereby ye may be able to quench the fiery Darts of the Wicked;</hi> they are called Darts, becauſe of their ſudden Injection; and fiery Ones, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Pain they occaſion; both which are plain Proofs, that they are not the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of your own Nature, for if ſo, they would be gradual and agreeable; do not therefore charge upon yourſelves, the Sins of the Devil, or be frightned or troubled about them, let him anſwer for his own Sins himſelf; Temptations that come from without, not conſented to by our Wills, are not our Sins, for thus our Saviour was tempted, and yet without Sin. 4th, He repreſents God to be all <hi>Anger</hi> and Revenge againſt them, inexorable to their Cries, and that he is only waiting for an Opportunity to deſtroy them; while they were in <hi>Security,</hi> he repreſented God in too favourable a Dreſs, as if he was all Mercy, and no Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; and now in too ſevere a one, as all Juſtice, and no Mercy: But how can it be, that the Almighty ſhould ſpare you, when you were going on with a high Hand againſt him in Sin, and take this Opportunity to
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:008266_0354_102E546A375494D0"/>
deſtroy you, when you are mourning for your Iniquities, and endeavouring to turn from them to him: No it can never be, for he himſelf has by his Spirit ſtirred you up to this, he that with Compaſſion heard <hi>Ephraim</hi>'s Moans, hears yours alſo, and will help you in due Time. 5th, Satan ſuggeſts that the Day of Grace is paſt, for, ſaith he, God takes no Notice of your Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and you are judicially hardened. <hi>A.</hi> It is no Proof that God takes no Notice of your Prayers, becauſe you are not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately anſwered; the Church complained, that God had <hi>ſhut out her Prayers,</hi> but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Cauſe; he is not bound to our Times, <hi>the Viſion is for an appointed Time,</hi> which we muſt wait for; while you bewail your Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Heart, it is not judicial; the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, rational, and beſt Part of Contrition, conſiſts in the Pliableneſs of the Will, and not in the ſoft Flow of the Affections, which though agreeable, is not eſſential to Contrition, but accidental and ſeparable; while you are with Seriouſneſs endeavouring to mourn over Sin, and turn from it to God, the Day of Grace is ſo far from being over with you, that this is the ſpecial Seaſon of it; now God is working by his Word and Spirit upon you, and graciouſly calling you to his Arms. 6th, Satan knowing that ſo
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:008266_0355_102E546CE3D0ABB0"/>
ſoon as ever the poor Sinner embraces Chriſt, and depends upon him entirely by Faith, the Match is made, which will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure for ever, and that then the Sinner will get out of his Clutches; he tries with all his Might to keep them from Faith, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes them as a Friend to beware of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming, and of being deceived, and to cover this Device, he tells them the Soul is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, it would be a great pity to be miſtaken, and likewiſe that they have been great Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and have not yet been ſufficiently hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and reformed, to prepare them for believing; without which, it would be raſh and dangerous. <hi>A.</hi> But for ſuch as feel their Diſeaſe, to receive the Gift of God, and lean upon him for Salvation, is ſo far from being preſumptuous, that it is a Duty; <hi>this is the Commandment, that ye believe in the Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this, the dear Redeemer ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly invites the Wounded (<hi>John</hi> 6.37.) this is therefore the Way to be ſaved and healed, inſtead of being deceived; nor does the ſacred Scriptures preſcribe any particular <hi>Degree</hi> of <hi>Humiliation</hi> and Reformation, as abſolutely neceſſary, previous to Faith, only this in general, that we be ſo ſenſible of the Danger of Sin, that we are willing to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake it, and embrace the Redeemer, as he
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:008266_0356_102E546F8605E690"/>
is offered to us in the Goſpel: It is therefore exceeding dangerous to defer any longer, a Cloſure with Chriſt, on Account of theſe, or any other Pretences whatſoever; let us then come to him as we are, as Sinners, without any <hi>Price</hi> in our Hands, and give ourſelves up to him for ever, in order to be made righteous and holy by his Blood and Spirit! 7th, Once more, Satan ſome Times tempts the Convinced, to believe that they have committed the <hi>unpardonable Sin,</hi> and therefore that it is <hi>too late</hi> for them to ſtrive; by this Means, through implacable Malice againſt <hi>God,</hi> and the Souls of Men, he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to drive them to Madneſs, Deſpair, or Self-Murder, and to keep them from Chriſt: But pray, how ſhould you be guilty of the unpardonable Sin? Before you were convinced, you could not commit it, for want of <hi>Light,</hi> and ſince you could not, for want of <hi>Will;</hi> ſince you have been awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, you have been trying to bewail your Offences, and come to Chriſt, which are inconſiſtent with that Sin, and plainly ſhew you are not guilty of it; but I have ſinned againſt Light and Mercy, and quenched God's holy Spirit. <hi>A.</hi> So have all of adult Age, more or leſs, and even many of thoſe that are now in Heaven; witneſs <hi>David, Solomon, Peter, Manaſſes,</hi> yea <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:008266_0357_102E547370441C10"/>
acknowledges, <hi>that what he would not, that he did,</hi> even after he was converted; this Objection concludes too much, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nothing at all: But I have Enmity againſt the Father, and the Son. <hi>A.</hi> What then, this is no more than all Mankind have naturally, and therefore it proves nothing againſt you; pray conſider, that the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,</hi> who are charged with this Sin, were convinced by the miraculous Works which Chriſt wrought, that he was the Meſſias, and yet contrary to their Conſciences, they rejected him, and the Way of Salvation by him, and from a Habit of Malice, aſcribed (openly in Words) his miraculous Works to the Devil, charged him with divers Crimes, and perſecuted him, and his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, to the Death. Theſe Things you cannot with Juſtice and Truth aſcribe to yourſelves, and therefore the Enemy's Charge is falſe; and indeed you ſhew little Judgment in giving heed to it, <hi>reſiſt the Devil, and he will flee from you;</hi> be the more frequent and earneſt in Prayer, and Satan will ſoon be tired, for he does not like to excite you to Devotion; the darkeſt Time of the Night, preceeds the Break of Day; in the Mount, God is ſeen; our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, is his Opportunity to ſhew Favour;
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:008266_0358_102E5474F2A82B90"/>
believe in the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and ye ſhall be ſaved. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>IN theſe Words is contained a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Invitation, in which four Things are remarkable, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting,</hi> the <hi>Perſons invited,</hi> the <hi>Duty invited to,</hi> and the <hi>Mode</hi> of the <hi>Invitation;</hi> each of which, I would diſcourſe upon in their Order.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE <hi>Perſons inviting,</hi> are the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Bride,</hi> and <hi>him that heareth;</hi> and, 1ſt, The <hi>Spirit</hi> invites poor Sinners to haſten to the Mediator, by his gracious Influences, through the Word, Ordinances, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences of God; by ſhewing the Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs,
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:008266_0361_102E547F96C74898"/>
Neceſſity, and Advantages thereof, in a clear and ſtrong Light to the Mind, and diſpoſing the Soul hereto; without his Operations all Means are like the <hi>Staff</hi> of <hi>Elijah,</hi> and the <hi>Pool</hi> of <hi>Siloam,</hi> before the Angel deſcended and troubled the Waters, unable to awake the Dead, or heal the Wounded! 2d, The <hi>Bride,</hi> i. e. ſuch as are really eſpouſed to Chriſt, ſincerely and earneſtly long after the Converſion of others: They have found by Experience, the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Sin, and the Sweetneſs of a Saviour's Love; and therefore bid awakened Sinners, heartily welcome to the dear Redemer. And, 3d, <hi>Him that heareth, ſayeth come;</hi> this Phraſe may intend ſome that wiſh well to the Redeemer's Kingdom, but are kept by unbelieving Fears, about the State of their Souls, from joining with the Church, in ſealing Ordinances; even ſuch are pleaſed, when they ſee Sinners flocking to the great <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> as Doves to their Windows! And bid them God Speed, at leaſt by the ſilent, but expreſſive Language, of their Looks and Behaviour. But the</p>
            <p n="2">2. PARTICULAR contained in the Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, is the <hi>Perſons invited;</hi> 1ſt, <hi>Him that is a-thirſt;</hi> this Character ſuppoſes a Sight and Senſe of Sin and Miſery, and implies earneſt and inſatiable Deſires after Relief,
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:008266_0362_102E54811976CC80"/>
which are uſually attended with Reſtleſſneſs and Pain, and followed with vehement and unwearied Endeavours to obtain Mercy, ſuch pray with Importunity, like convinced <hi>Saul,</hi> and preſs with determined Reſolution, into the Kingdom of God, though it be ſome Times, through a Crowd of Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Temptation. And, 2d, <hi>Whoſoever will,</hi> i. e. is willing to forſake all Sin, all Self-Dependance, and accept a whole Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, with his Law and Croſs, as well as depend entirely on his Blood, and live to him; every ſuch Perſon is invited by the bleſſed God, to come and take the Water of Life freely; let his outward State be never ſo poor and mean, his Sins ever ſo many, or ſo great; and his Troubles for them, in his Apprehenſion, ever ſo ſmall? All theſe are no Hindrances to Remiſſion and Salvation, in caſe you believe. The</p>
            <p n="3">3. PARTICULAR in the Invitation, is the <hi>Duties invited to,</hi> which are theſe, 1ſt, To <hi>come to Chriſt,</hi> and his Benefits, which are doubtleſs intended by the <hi>Water of Life,</hi> in this Text: Now <hi>coming to Chriſt,</hi> moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſignifies, our <hi>believing</hi> in him; he therefore that believes that Chriſt is the Son of God, the Saviour of the World, <hi>able and willing to ſave all that come to the Father by him;</hi>

<pb n="326" facs="unknown:008266_0363_102E5483CBA097D0"/>
Terms of Self-Denial, taking up the Croſs, and following Chriſt, that the Goſpel offers him, and his Benefits upon, and fully Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to them; he that relies upon his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation entirely, for a Right to Happineſs, under a Senſe of Guilt and Impotency, and commits the Concerns of his Salvation into his Hands, with Freedom, Deſire, and Hope, and in Conſequence hereof, brings forth the Fruits of the Spirit, comes to Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 1.12, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. 2d. The other Duty here recommended, is to <hi>take the Water of Life freely,</hi> i. e. to accept of Chriſt, his Spirit, and Grace, as the Gift of God's unexcited Mercy, which you do not, nor can deſerve, by any, or all of your Performances, paſt, preſent, or fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and which he is under no Obligation to vouchſafe, either by his Nature or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, but may abſolutely deny in Conſiſtency with both, after you have done your ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt: This is intended by the divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, of <hi>buying Wine and Milk, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Money, and without Price; the Poor in Spirit are bleſſed, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> JEHOVAH <hi>hears the Cries of the Poor and Needy, nor does he deſpiſe the Prayers of the Deſtitute; in him the Fatherleſs find Mercy;</hi> i. e. ſuch as feel themſelves to be worthleſs, helpleſs, forlorn Orphans, and
<pb n="327" facs="unknown:008266_0364_102E54854E5B3F48"/>
flee to him for Relief, ſhall be graciouſly received by him. The grand Qualification, is to be ſenſible we have none, and come to the bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as condemned <hi>Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,</hi> for the free Remiſſion of all our Guilt by his Blood; as polluted <hi>Lepers,</hi> for clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from all our Filthineſs by his Spirit; as <hi>Orphans,</hi> for ſhelter from all our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, under his Wing; as <hi>Beggars,</hi> for an Alms of mere Mercy; as <hi>little Children,</hi> to be inſtructed in all we ſhould believe and do: Unleſs we have this Temper of Mind, we cannot depend upon the Mediator en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, nor are we diſpoſed to value ſuitably, and ſeek intenſely, the important Benefits of his Purchaſe, or to render to God, the Honour due for them<note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.15, 32. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3, 62, 3.9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23, 28. <hi>James</hi> 1.18. <hi>John</hi> 1.13. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 19. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5.</note>.</p>
            <p>The Lord JESUS CHRIST, and his Grace, are in our Text, called WATER OF LIFE, or compared to a Fountain of Waters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of ſome Analogy between them, which appears in the following Inſtances; as Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cools in the ſultry Heat, ſo the Blood of JESUS pacifies the Conſcience; as Water quenches the Thirſt of the Body, ſo does the Grace of Chriſt that of the Soul; <hi>he that drinks of this living Water ſhall never Thirſt, but it ſhall be in him as a Well of
<pb n="328" facs="unknown:008266_0365_102E54891F0C8C20"/>
Water; (John</hi> 4.10, 13, 14.) As Streams of Water are not only beautiful in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but beautify the Bodies they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to, ſo the dear JESUS is not only in himſelf <hi>lovely,</hi> but he makes his People ſo, with his <hi>Comlineſs;</hi> as Water runs freely and ſteadily from a Fountain, when Land-Floods are either dried up with the Summer Heat, or frozen with the Winter Cold; ſo the Grace of Chriſt, is in the Souls of his People, as a <hi>Fountain of Waters, ſpringing up to eternal Life:</hi> Chriſt, and his Grace, may be truly called Water of Life, becauſe through this, he gives a Right to eternal Life, purchaſed by his Blood, as well as implants and preſerves to the End, a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of divine Life, by his Spirit and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion; which makes meet for Eternal! But the</p>
            <p n="4">4. PARTICULAR in the Invitation, is the MODE of it. The Invitation is preſſed three Times, in our Text, to ſhew, 1ſt, The abſolute Certainty, and great MOMENT of the Duty enjoined; our eternal All depends upon it; without <hi>Union</hi> to Chriſt, we can have no <hi>Title</hi> to his precious Benefits; now FAITH is the <hi>Band</hi> of this <hi>Union;</hi> as Bread, if it be not eaten, will not nouriſh us, as Raiment not put on, will not cloath us, as a Medicine unapplied, will not heal us, ſo
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:008266_0366_102E548BB387FC70"/>
Chriſt, and his Benefits, will be of no ſaving Service to us, unleſs they be received by FAITH; by this we feed on the <hi>Bread</hi> of Life, put on the Lord JESUS CHRIST, and are healed by the <hi>Balm</hi> of <hi>Gilead.</hi> Nothing is more frequently enjoined, and ſtrongly recommended in the ſacred Oracles, than this Grace of <hi>Faith;</hi> by this we are juſtified from the Guilt of Sin (<hi>Acts</hi> 13.39.) ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from its Stain (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18.) adopted into the Family of God (<hi>John</hi> 1.12.) and admitted into Heaven (<hi>John</hi> 3.16.) by this we are comforted in all our Sorrows (<hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2.) in this we ſhould pray (<hi>James</hi> 1.6.) by this we ſhould live (<hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20.) and in this we ſhould die (<hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13.) the total Want of this Chriſt abſolutely condemns (<hi>John</hi> 8.24.) Averſion to this he paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bewails (<hi>John</hi> 5.40.) Weakneſs in this he ſharply reproves (<hi>Luke</hi> 24.25.) a great Degree of this he highly commends (<hi>Mat.</hi> 15.22, 29.) <hi>Behold, a Woman of Canaan cried unto him, ſaying, have Mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David, my Daughter is grievouſly vexed with a Devil; but he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered her not a Word: And his Diſciples came and beſought him, ſaying, ſend her away, for ſhe crieth after us: But he anſwered and ſaid, I am not ſent but to the loſt Sheep of the Houſe of Iſrael; then came ſhe and worſhipped
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:008266_0367_102E548D342453E0"/>
him, ſaying, Lord help me: But he anſwered and ſaid, it is not meet to take the Childrens Bread and caſt it to Dogs; and ſhe ſaid truth Lord: Yet the Dogs eat of the Crumbs which fall from their Maſter's Table; then Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto her, O Woman, great is thy Faith, be it unto thee even as thou wilt.</hi> Here obſerve, the Petitioner was a <hi>Pagan,</hi> the Errand ſhe came upon, was the <hi>Cure</hi> of her <hi>Daughter,</hi> who was under ſome diſtreſſing bodily Diſtemper, in which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan had a Hand; this humane and amiable Parent, ſympathized with her poor Child, and came to the Mediator on her Account, for Help. O! may not the noble Example of this virtuous and devout <hi>Pagan,</hi> make thoſe PARENTS, falſly called CHRISTIAN, aſhamed, whoſe <hi>Children</hi> are under the <hi>Tyranny</hi> of the <hi>Devil,</hi> poſting faſt to <hi>Ruin,</hi> and yet neglect to bring them to <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be <hi>healed,</hi> as this <hi>Canaanite</hi> did her <hi>Daughter,</hi> who petitioned with Modeſty and Vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence for <hi>Mercy</hi> in her Behalf, and looked on it as Mercy to herſelf! <hi>ſhe cried unto him, ſaying, have Mercy on me, O Lord,</hi> and waited with Patience and Perſeverance in the Way of Duty, for the Anſwer of her Suit, till ſhe was three Times repulſed! At firſt Chriſt was ſilent, <hi>he anſwered her not a Word,</hi> which was a dark Symptom! and
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:008266_0368_102E548FCC078760"/>
when his Diſciples interpoſed, perhaps more to befriend themſelves than her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wearied with her Importunity; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats the Repulſe, by ſaying, <hi>I am not ſent but to the loſt Sheep of the Houſe of Iſrael:</hi> The Door of Mercy ſeemed to be now quite ſhut, yet this poor Woman, the Honour of her Sex, was neither offended nor diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, but renews her <hi>Importunity,</hi> with increaſing Reverence and Vehemence, <hi>then came ſhe and worſhipped, ſaying, Lord help me;</hi> a ſhort, but ſubſtantial and humble Prayer: Upon this our Lord gave her a third Repulſe, accompanied with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, ſaying, <hi>It is not meet to take the Children's Bread, and caſt it to Dogs;</hi> this brought her Calamity to the higheſt <hi>Criſis,</hi> for it ſeemed to be a final Rejection, and that with an Appearance of <hi>Contempt;</hi> for our Saviour hereby implicitly called her and her Daughter DOGS: Surprizing that the compaſſionate REDEEMER, <hi>whoſe Speech diſtills as the Rain and Dew upon the tender Herb,</hi> ſhould ſpeak thus roughly to a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, importunate Supplicant! but it was with a kind Intention, to try and manifeſt her Faith, and render the Mercy implored, the more agreeable and affecting, when vouchſafed! as well as to magnify his own Power and Grace in the Iſſue! But let us
<pb n="332" facs="unknown:008266_0369_102E54914E61E668"/>
attend the Petitioner's Anſwer, to the <hi>third Repulſe;</hi> here let us be all Ear, all Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! and <hi>ſhe the Syrophaenician ſaid, truth Lord, yet the Dogs eat of the Crumbs which fall from their Maſter's Table:</hi> It is, as if ſhe had ſaid, <q>Lord, I confeſs, the <hi>Jews</hi> are Children, and I and my Daughter are DOGS, poor HEATHENS, no Members of God's viſible Kingdom; and that it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, that we who are Dogs, ſhould be ſerved before all the Children are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied; but Lord, I do not preſume to aſk a full Manifeſtation of thy Power and Goodneſs to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> till an Offer of Mercy is made to the <hi>loſt Sheep</hi> of the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> I only beg a CRUMB of Mercy for myſelf and my poor Child, and Lord, though it is not cuſtomary, to give whole Loaves prepared for Children to Dogs, yet they are permitted to pick up the Crumbs that fall from their Maſter's Table, O let us have the ſame Privilege; I believe Lord thou haſt a ſufficient Full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Grace and Bleſſing, to ſatisfy the Children, and ſpare us a few <hi>Crumbs!</hi>
               </q>
What Humility appears in this Anſwer, in acknowledging herſelf to be a <hi>Dog?</hi> What <hi>Modeſty,</hi> in begging no more but a <hi>Crumb?</hi> What <hi>Faith, Fervency,</hi> and <hi>Ingenuity,</hi> in bearing up under ſo many Repulſes, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
<pb n="333" facs="unknown:008266_0370_102E54950BF35B50"/>
her Suit notwithſtanding of them, and in forming a <hi>Plea</hi> from a <hi>Refuſal</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force it! The Iſſue of this Struggle was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and comfortable, <hi>and Jeſus ſaid unto her, O Woman, great is thy Faith, be it unto thee even as thou wilt:</hi> Hitherto, the dear Redeemer put on a ſtern Aſpect, but now he looks ſerene, and ſpeaks like himſelf, as <hi>Joſeph,</hi> when he made himſelf known to his Brethren, ſaying, I am <hi>Joſeph!</hi> Though di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Graces ſhone with uncommon Luſtre, in this amiable Lady's heroine and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary Conduct; yet the greateſt Honour is put upon her Faith (becauſe this honours God more than any other Grace) the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of which, appears in her importunate perſiſting, after ſo many Diſcouragements and Refuſals; as <hi>Jacob,</hi> who wreſtled with his God, and prevailed; ſhe as a Princeſs, ſucceeded in her Suit, and obtained the Bleſſing ſhe deſired! And truly Brethren, the Way to get our <hi>Will,</hi> is to <hi>believe in Jeſus!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ANOTHER Inſtance of our Saviour's <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending</hi> a great Degree of FAITH, is the <hi>Centurion,</hi> who waited upon our Saviour, for the Cure of his ſick Servant; to whom our Lord ſaid, <hi>he would come and heal him;</hi> but this <hi>Roman</hi> CAPTAIN anſwered and ſaid, <hi>Lord I am not worthy, that thou ſhouldſt
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:008266_0371_102E5498B98E1D98"/>
come under my Roof, but ſpeak the Word only, and my Servant ſhall be healed; when Jeſus heard it, he marvelled, and ſaid, verily I have not found ſo great Faith, no not in Iſrael;</hi> ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.8, 10. The Anſwer of this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, was truly admirable, full of ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Humility, Reverence, and <hi>Faith:</hi> He was loth that our Lord, ſhould put himſelf to the Trouble of going to his Houſe, a Favour which he reckoned himſelf unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of, nor did he think there was the leaſt Neceſſity of his perſonal Preſence to effect the Cure: <hi>Only ſpeak the Word,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>and my Servant ſhall be healed;</hi> he nobly believed, that our Lord, had as abſolute controul over Diſeaſes, as he over his Soldiers: An Example of Piety and Humanity this, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the Admiration, and Imitation of all, and eſpecially of ſuch, who are of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Order!

            <p>FOR Eminence in this glorious Grace of <hi>Faith,</hi> an honourable Title and Encomium, were given to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and are tranſmitted to all Generations, as a Motive and Pattern, to all his ſpiritual, as well as natural Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.17, 22. <hi>I have made thee a Father of many Nations; who againſt Hope</hi> (or the outward Appearance, and general Courſe of Things) <hi>believed in Hope: He ſtaggered not at the Promiſe through Unbelief,

but was ſtrong in Faith, giving Glory to God, being fully perſwaded, that what he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, he was able to perform.</hi> After the Promiſe of a numerous Poſterity, he had no Iſſue by <hi>Sarah,</hi> till they were both ſo advanced in Years, that it was utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, according to the Courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Twenty Years elapſed, before <hi>Iſaac</hi> was born, this SON of his <hi>aged Years,</hi> this Son of his pregnant <hi>Hopes,</hi> this Son of the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> the <hi>Staff</hi> of his <hi>Age,</hi> the <hi>Darling</hi> of his <hi>Heart,</hi> his <hi>only Son,</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> whom he <hi>loved,</hi> he is commanded peremptorily, without any Reaſon aſſigned, to SLAY, and that with his <hi>own</hi> HAND; O amazing Trial! what unſurmountable Difficulties attended his Compliance?

            <p>BUT the MODE of <hi>Invitation,</hi> ſpeaks the convinced Sinners great <hi>Backwardneſs</hi> to <hi>believe;</hi> it is as difficult to perſwade a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced Sinner to believe, as the Secure
<pb n="338" facs="unknown:008266_0375_102E54A0F855B120"/>
to awake: The Secure have many Excuſes, e. g. God is merciful, I am not ſo bad as many others, nor ſo bad as I have formerly been myſelf; I have a good Heart, thank God, and many good Thoughts, and mean no Harm to any; I have never wronged a Man of a Penny in my Life, and am no Hypocrite, as many are: On the Contrary, the Convinced have many Excuſes againſt believing, which is owing to the following Cauſes, <hi>viz.</hi> 1ſt, To our being born under a <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Works,</hi> the Veſſels retain a Tang of the Liquor firſt put into it; <hi>the Law is not of Faith, but he that doth the Things written therein, ſhall live by them;</hi> i. e. he who perſonally, perfectly, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually obeys the Law, ſhall obtain eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, by his Obedience, without FAITH in a MEDIATOR: But we have broken the Law, in our firſt Parents, and therefore Salvation by it, is now rendered impoſſible, for we are all condemned for Original Sin, and curſed for the leaſt Actual, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.9, 10. Yet, though this Way be ſhut up, our natural Deſire after Salvation by it continues. 2d, Another Cauſe of our Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs to Believe, is our <hi>Ignorance</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> Method of Salvation, by Grace; <hi>the natural Man does not underſtand the Things of the Spirit of God,</hi> and in particular, he
<pb n="339" facs="unknown:008266_0376_102E54A7336614C0"/>
does not clearly perceive the Difference, between Salvation by the <hi>Law,</hi> or by <hi>Grace;</hi> but ſtill dreams contrary to God's expreſs Declaration, that <hi>it is of him that willeth, and of him that runneth, and not of God that ſheweth Mercy.</hi> Mere ſpeculative Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, will not divorce us from the Law, as a Huſband; let Men hear ever ſo much of the new Covenant Way of Salvation by Grace, they have not a diſtinct, affecting View of it, till it be opened to them, by the Word and Spirit of God, and therefore even when they are awakened, they try to cure themſelves by a more ſtrict and earneſt Performance of Duty, and are amazed and nonpluſſed, when they find this Method does not anſwer their Deſign! They labour to join the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and their own, and make a patched, Cloak to ſcreen them from the divine Vengeance; but they may as eaſily make a Rope of Sand, or unite Light and Darkneſs, ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.5, 6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.4. 3d, <hi>Pride</hi> oppoſes Faith, it goes againſt the Grain to be beholden to Chriſt for a free Cure, haughty Sinners ſcorn to ſtoop to the humble State of <hi>Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars,</hi> and therefore try to <hi>barter</hi> and truck for Salvation with Almighty God, as if they could keep even Scores with him, or bring Immenſity in Debt; they love the <hi>Spider</hi>'s
<pb n="340" facs="unknown:008266_0377_102E54A8D2B3DB68"/>
proud Motto, I am Debtor to myſelf alone; and hence it is ſaid of the <hi>Jews, Rom.</hi> 10.3. <hi>That being ignorant of God's Righteouſneſs, and going about to eſtabliſh their own, they did not ſubmit themſelves to the Righteouſneſs of God.</hi> This is the Reaſon why natural Men ſpurn with ſuch Indignation againſt the <hi>Sovereignty</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and grapple with him for his Throne; they cannot endure to think of being under his Controul: No, inſtead of that, they will have their Creator de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant on their Wills forſooth; and obliged to lacky after their inſolent and precarious Nod! and tell ſmooth Stories, to palliate their blaſphemous Arrogance; as if it was right and reaſonable, that they ſhould take the Reins of Empire, and occupy <hi>Jehovah</hi>'s Place: But Sinners muſt bow, or be broken in Pieces, humbled or damned! <hi>Iſ.</hi> 28.18, 20. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. 4th, Another Cauſe of Men's Backwardneſs to believe, is FEAR of PRESUMPTION; preſuming of Mercy out of God's Way, was their Sin before, and the Fear of preſuming in the Way of Duty, is their Sin now: It is, no Doubt, Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to expect Mercy, in the Way of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety and Unbelief; but it cannot be Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption to obey God's poſitive Command, and kind Invitation, in believing his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Word, and accepting his gracious Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers:
<pb n="341" facs="unknown:008266_0378_102E54AA5672D768"/>
The Devil is as buſy to keep the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced from Faith, as the Secure from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction; and this he does as an Angel of Light, under a Cloak of Friendſhip; to the Secure he ſays, take care you do not Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, and to the Convinced, take care you do not preſume, by believing over haſtily, before you are ſufficiently prepared for it; and alas, the Misfortune is, he is ſooner believed than the God of Truth! 5th, Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cauſe is, EASE in DUTIES WITHOUT CHRIST; they mourn, pray, reſolve, reform, and theſe Things give them Eaſe; but alas, Friends, this is a falſe Cure: Though theſe Duties are good in their Places, as neceſſary Means to obtain the Favour of God, yet they are not the End, they are not Chriſt; we muſt be acquainted with him, or periſh for ever: The <hi>ſtung Iſraelites</hi> muſt <hi>look</hi> on the <hi>brazen Serpent,</hi> or die in their <hi>Wounds;</hi> now, <hi>as Moſes lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderneſs, even ſo muſt the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have eternal Life, John</hi> 3.14, 15. If Duties would heal without Chriſt, then there was no need of his being ſent into the World.</p>
            <p>FROM what has been ſaid, we may learn, the Goodneſs and Love of <hi>God,</hi> in providing ſuch a ſuitable and ſufficient <hi>Redeemer,</hi> for

            <p>NOTWITHSTANDING all the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of GOD, the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> treacherouſly departed from him, as an adulterous Wife, from an affectionate Huſband; for which, divers Calamities were ſent upon them, with which, the holy Spirit graciouſly co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating, many had an affecting View, both of their Sin and Puniſhment; ſo that <hi>a Voice of Weeping and Supplication was heard in the Places</hi> of public Convention, they affectionately acknowledged their Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and earneſtly implored Mercy: O! that as we have imitated them in their Sin and Puniſhment, we may be enabled to imitate them in their Weeping, Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

and Diſpoſition, to return, to the God from whom we ſtrayed. Verily, Brethren, there is as great Neceſſity, that our Places of public Worſhip ſhould be BOCHIMS; for our Sins are more heinous, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt greater Light and Love; and divine Juſtice is certainly diſpoſed to propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Calamities, to the Crimes of Offenders, nor is there any Reaſon to expect a nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Deliverance in Mercy, from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes we feel or fear, without a general Repentance, and Reformation of Manners: But theſe, would open a Door of Hope, and diffuſe a Gleam of Light upon our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nighted Nation, as on the People of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> for behold, while they bemoan themſelves, a gracious God addreſſes them in the loving Language of our Text; <hi>Return ye back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding Children, and I will heal your Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings:</hi> The Words contain a <hi>gracious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation,</hi> in which four Things are obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Inviter,</hi> the bleſſed GOD; the <hi>Perſons invited,</hi> the People of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> the <hi>Duty invited</hi> to, <hi>returning to God,</hi> a <hi>Motive</hi> to this propoſed, and <hi>I will heal your Backſlidings.</hi> And,</p>

            <p n="1">1. WE <hi>decline</hi> in <hi>Sentiment,</hi> when through the Corruption of our own Nature, together with the Stratagems of Satan, and artful Colourings of his Inſtruments, we depart, in any Degree, from the Simplicity of the Truth, as it is in Chriſt, and embrace thoſe Doctrines, which flatter the Pride of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and tend to fix fooliſh Sinners, upon the ſandy Bottom of their own Wiſdom, Power, and Righteouſneſs, to the Diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of Chriſt, and his Goſpel, and the Ruin of many Souls: Of this Stamp, are Doctrines of a <hi>Light in all Mankind,</hi> ſufficient to Salvation, without the ſacred Scriptures; a <hi>free Will,</hi> in the Unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, to do ſpiritual Good; and of <hi>Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> partly, or wholly, <hi>by Works;</hi> add to theſe, the <hi>Arian, Socinian,</hi> and <hi>Deiſtical Schemes,</hi> whereby many have with ſome ſhew of Wiſdom, endeavoured to baniſh the grand Peculiars of Chriſtianity from the Earth; but <hi>his Church is built upon a Rock,

            <p>THE <hi>Cauſes</hi> of <hi>Backſliding,</hi> are either General, or Particular; the general Cauſes are the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Death</hi> within us, and the numberleſs Devices of <hi>Satan,</hi> in concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence therewith, which for the Sake of Brevity, I ſhall wave, and proceed to ſpeak upon the particular Cauſes, which are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally theſe following, <hi>viz.</hi> 1ſt, <hi>Neglect</hi> of the <hi>Heart;</hi> when Perſons take chief Care about the Outſide, and ſeem eaſy if that is regular, how wretched ſoever it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and are rather deſirous to have Praiſe of Man, than of God; this is the Beginning of Sorrows, for the Heart is the Parent of Action, and when that is not attended to, every Thing goes wrong; in this Situation, the Soul is like a Watch, when the Main-Spring is not well ſet; we are therefore enjoined to keep the Heart with all Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, becauſe out of it are the Iſſues of Life, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.23. 2d, Another Cauſe is <hi>Sloth,</hi> in reſpect of the ſecret Duties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, ſuch as frequent ejaculatory Prayer, and ſtated Prayer, and Meditation in the Cloſſet, or a ſuperficial Performance of them: When the Spouſe made Excuſes about riſing to open to her Lord, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently withdrew, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.3, 6. When
<pb n="354" facs="unknown:008266_0391_102E54CC91C963F8"/>
we are negligent, God is grieved, our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh of Religion abates, and we are gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally carried farther into the Spirit and Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the World: This deteſtable Iniquity, is at the Root of all Backſlidings and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacies in Religion, for the Proverb is true, <hi>That nemo repente fit turpiſtsimus;</hi> A Man does not ſit in the Scorners Chair at firſt, no, he firſt ſtands in the Way of Sinners, and walks in the Council of the Ungodly: O! it is no eaſy Matter to perſevere to the End, in a Courſe of religious Diligence; and yet the <hi>Savour</hi> of <hi>Piety</hi> cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved without it: It is eaſy to begin well to Appearance, but to continue <hi>(hic Labor, hoc opus)</hi> is the grand Difficulty, and yet this is neceſſary to crown the Scene; for it is ſuch only, that <hi>perſevere to the End, who ſhall be ſaved.</hi> But, 3d, Another Cauſe is <hi>Unwatchfulneſs;</hi> when we do not watch againſt Temptations to Sin, or for Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of doing and receiving Good; this makes us an eaſy prey to our vigilant and cruel Enemies, who are ſtrong and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and we but weak and corrupt: Our Honour and Safety, as well as the Credit of Religion, do much depend upon our keeping a good Look-out; unleſs we are conſtantly on our Guard, we ſhall be ſoon enſnared and taken by Surprize, to our
<pb n="355" facs="unknown:008266_0392_102E54D14BB0FF08"/>
own Reproach and Loſs, and to the Shame and Grief of thoſe that fear God, who will be wounded through our Sides: This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, juſtly moved the Pſalmiſt, to pray earneſtly to his God, that <hi>none that ſought him ſhould be aſhamed on his Account;</hi> a very neceſſary Petition for us all; for we are in the Body, in great and conſtant Danger. And, dear Sirs, it would be much better for us to be hid in the Duſt, than to live to the Diſhonour of God: O then let us ſtrictly and ſteadily obſerve the important Counſel of our Lord, to <hi>watch and pray, leſt we enter into Temptation:</hi> While others are only watching to divert the Company, we ſhould watch for an Opportunity to put in a Word for <hi>God,</hi> this would be as Apples of Gold, in Pictures of Silver. 4th, Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cauſe is, <hi>Trifling with Opportunities of public Worſhip;</hi> ſtaying at Home ſome Times without ſufficient Reaſon, and when they do come, do it not after earneſt Endeavours to get their Hearts in a right Frame, and with ſerious Deſires to profit; nor do they attend with Engagedneſs, and afterwards labour to digeſt what they have heard, by Meditation and Prayer: In ſuch a Courſe, nothing can be reaſonably expected but Decays; for as the natural Life cannot be ſuſtained without <hi>Food,</hi> and that digeſted,
<pb n="356" facs="unknown:008266_0393_102E54D310A72348"/>
ſo neither can the Spiritual: The Word preached, is not only deſigned to form, but to finiſh Faith, and perfect the Body of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 22. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12. We ſhould therefore, <hi>as new born Babes, deſire the ſincere Milk of the Word, that we may grow thereby, and with Meekneſs receive it;</hi> for unleſs it be mixed with Faith, it will not profit us: We ſhould attend, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> from a Principle of Obedience to God's Authority, with an Eye to his Glory, and our own eternal Happineſs; for he commands us <hi>not to forget the Aſſembling of ourſelves together, as the Manner of ſome is, Heb.</hi> 10.25. and graciouſly promiſes, that <hi>where two or three are gathered together in his Name, he will be in the Midſt of them, Mat.</hi> 18.20. and that <hi>in all Places where he records his Name, he will come unto his People, and will bleſs them, Ex.</hi> 20.24. But to proceed, 5th, <hi>Neglect</hi> of the frequent <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a Cauſe of <hi>Backſliding;</hi> when Perſons do not often mourn over their Sins, and oppoſe their Conſtitution Iniquity, they can have no Conſciouſneſs of Integrity, or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably expect divine Influence, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.29. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. Nor is it leſs prejudicial to our Growth in Goodneſs, to neglect a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent renewing of our Conſent to the Terms
<pb n="357" facs="unknown:008266_0394_102E54D491877128"/>
of the New-Covenant; and a reallizing by Faith, the Perfections and Friendſhip of GOD, and a State of future Glory: We ſhould frequently exerciſe Faith, upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Objects, and in particular, on the All-ſufficiency of God; he is infinitely more than ſufficient to ſatisfy our Souls in any Situation, and without him there is none to be had in any, that deſerves the Name; his Love will give Content in Rags, and make Bread and Water ſweet: Faith being the Conduit, whereby all divine Influence is communicated from Chriſt to us; it is therefore vain to expect Growth in Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, without the frequent Exerciſe thereof. 6th, <hi>Neglect</hi> of <hi>living upon</hi> the <hi>Promiſes,</hi> is another Cauſe of <hi>Backſliding;</hi> the <hi>Words of God are not Yea, and Nay,</hi> uncertain like thoſe of Creatures; <hi>but Yea, and Amen,</hi> of infallible Certainty: The Promiſes are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the Support of our Faith, that thereby Holineſs and Comfort may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted in us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. Now when we either do not conſider, or ſtagger at the Promiſes, it is no Wonder our Comfort and Progreſs in Holineſs are mar'd: The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are admirably ſuited to all the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of this preſent Life; conſider in Perplexity, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 32.8. in Danger, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 32.7. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 91.4. in Want, <hi>Philip.</hi> 4.19. <hi>Iſ.</hi>

33.16. in Sickneſs, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 41.3. in outward Diſtreſſes, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 46.1. <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.27. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 27.9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10. under the Power and Guilt of Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.2, 4. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 1.8, 19. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 43.25. if tempted by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.20. under Fears reſpecting Perſeverance, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. if dejected, <hi>John</hi> 16.22. if deſerted, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 54.7, 8. under Fears reſpecting Salvation, <hi>John</hi> 10.28.</p>
            <p>UNTHANKFULNESS to God, for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Benefits, and neglect of <hi>rejoicing</hi> in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> is another Cauſe of Decays; when we take every Thing by the worſt Handle, are always complaining, and croud Thankſgiving into a Corner, how can we grow? Should we not <hi>in all Things give Thanks?</hi> There is not one Difficulty that we ever met with, that we could ſpare without Injury; they are all ſuited by infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Wiſdom, in reſpect of their Kind, Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, Duration, and Time of Infliction, to our ſpiritual Advantage; and what would we have more? Should we not therefore heartily bleſs God for them all, ſeeing they are Fruits of his fatherly Care and Love, which is not a feminine Fondneſs, but a maſculine Affection, that proſecutes the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereſt Meaſures to compaſs the Good of its Object! But how ſhall I be thankful for Afflictions, ſeeing I have found no Good

by them. <hi>A.</hi> Have not you, under them been at Times humbled, as well as ſtirred up to pour out Prayers before God, with unuſual Importunity, and reſolved to be holy? And are not theſe Benefits? But if you ſhould reject this Reply, God's <hi>Promiſe</hi> is a ſufficient Anſwer, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>they ſhall work together for your Good,</hi> in his Time, and Way; though <hi>no Affliction for the preſent is joyous, but grievous, nevertheleſs it afterwards yields the peaceable Fruits of Righteouſneſs, to thoſe that are exerciſed therewith;</hi> God's Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment over the World is holy and good, <hi>he is wiſe in Counſel, and wonderful in Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi> But how can I rejoice, who am ſo full of Sin, and of no Uſe in the World? <hi>A.</hi> If Sin be your principal Burden, it does not reign, and therefore you will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for it; and if you ſincerely deſire to be of Uſe to Mankind, it is an Argument of true Goodneſs: It ſhould alſo be obſerved, that there are different Kinds of Service, becauſe of the different Stations in Life we ſuſtain, and the different Talents we poſſeſs; ſome more eminent, direct, and diſcernable, and ſome leſs ſo; yet all acceptable to God, through Chriſt, and all uſeful: Though the <hi>Foot</hi> has not the Place, or Uſe of the <hi>Eye,</hi> yet it is Neceſſary, and of Service in the Body. The Kind, Degree, and Times
<pb n="360" facs="unknown:008266_0397_102E556C166FAAE8"/>
of our Uſefulneſs, are fixed by the divine Purpoſe, to which Providence exactly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponds; <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.11. with which we ſhould be ſatisfied; Duty is ours, but Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs is God's, and therefore ſhould be left to him; we may be of more Service by our Prayers, and the ſilent Influence of good Examples, than we know of; nor will our future Recompence be commenſurate to our Succeſs, but to our Fidelity in our Maſter's Service; <hi>though Iſrael be not gathered,</hi> yet if ſincere and laborious, <hi>we ſhall be precious in the Eyes of the Lord:</hi> But ſuppoſing we are in a great Degree uſeleſs, will Murmuring and Unbelief mend the Matter? No! but make it worſe! for hereby we offend God, and break our Conſtitutions: Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be pleaſed with God's Providence, and go on in the Way of Duty rejoicing! But my State is bad, how can I rejoice? <hi>A.</hi> If you have been ſlain by the Law, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the Mediator without reſerve, in all his Offices, and in the general Courſe of your Lives, are endeavouring to come out of this World, leaning upon him, if the Temper of your Hearts, is for the moſt Part ſpiritual; and you make Conſcience of your Thoughts, Words, and Actions; if you Love all pious People for Chriſt's Sake cordially, and are ſollicitous to preſerve the

Savour of Religion in your Hearts, and to grow in Goodneſs in <hi>Life;</hi> notwithſtanding of your Weakneſſes, you are vitally united to Chriſt, he is your Head and Huſband, and therefore whatever Cauſe you have of Humiliation and Sorrow upon your own Account, you have Cauſe to Rejoice in him, for he is your Righteouſneſs and your Strength, and will be your Song at laſt.</p>
            <p>LET us therefore labour to get more into the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> by avoiding judging of our State in a Time of Deſertion, for Objects cannot be diſcerned in the Dark, and in that Situation we are in Danger of paſſing too ſevere a Judgment againſt ourſelves, which is very prejudicial both to our Comfort and Growth, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 50.10. Let us beware of condemning the State of our Souls, becauſe we have not had ſuch a great Degree of Diſtreſs as ſome others, or ſuch Comforts, Sealings, and Progreſs in Religion; if we have but the Root of the Matter, <hi>let us go on towards Perfection, Heb.</hi> 6.4. to be every now and then digging up the <hi>Foundations</hi> of our Hope, and poring <hi>too much</hi> upon the <hi>Law,</hi> tends to damp our Spirits, diſcourage us in Religion, and keep us always in a State of Infancy; no, when the Law has done its Work, in Slaying us, it is of no farther Uſe

but to Guide our Conduct, and humble our Spirits, for our Violations of it; having felt the Spirit of Bondage to Fear, let us believe in JESUS, in this we cannot be wrong, for <hi>Chriſt is the End of the Law, for Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to every one that believeth (Rom.</hi> 10.4.) <hi>this is the Commandment</hi> (1 <hi>John</hi> 3.23.) if we were before wrong, this is the Way to be right, and if right, to know it: O then let us learn to <hi>live by Faith,</hi> and not by Senſe; hereby we ſhall Evidence ourſelves to be the genuine <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Abram,</hi> who <hi>ſtaggered not at the Promiſe, through Unbelief, but was ſtrong in Faith, giving Glory to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ANOTHER Cauſe of <hi>Backſliding,</hi> is <hi>Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice</hi> in the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of GOD, which is as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive to him, as prejudicial to us, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.38.

the Number, and heighten the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of their Diſtreſſes, and make them inſurmountable, that <hi>though they follow after their Lovers they ſhall not overtake them;</hi> they ſhall be ſo environ'd and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur'd with a Train of great and growing Calamities, that even though they attempt to gratify their corrupt Inclinations, they ſhall not be able to effect the Deſign againſt my Honour and their own Happineſs, no more than they can by a ſudden Sally break through or leap over a ſtrong and high Wall.</q> Such indeed was the <hi>Aſſyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Army under <hi>Salmanezar</hi> to the <hi>Jews;</hi> it coop'd them up in the City of <hi>Samaria</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Space of three Years, and at laſt ſtripp'd them to the Skin, and carry'd them captive to a ſtrange Country: And ſuch was <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> who took all the fenced Cities of <hi>Judah</hi> (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.) In the mean Time Encouragement is imply'd in the Word LEAST, that in caſe they abandon'd their Impieties, the threatned Judgments would be averted. <hi>Then ſhall ſhe ſay, I will go and return to my firſt Huſband:</hi> Firſt, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Time, of Dignity and Right; <hi>for then was it better with me than now:</hi> Being wearied in the Greatneſs of their Way with fruitleſs Labour and vain Purſuit, and being aſham'd of their Hopes, like the Troops of
<pb n="377" facs="unknown:008266_0414_102E54FC542B9EB8"/>
               <hi>Tema,</hi> and diſpairing of Help and Satisfaction from their Idols in Time coming, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe remembering the Comfort they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had in God, as a Huſband; they now reſolve to return to him in earneſt, and without Delay. From the Text, I may obſerve theſe Propoſitions; 1ſt, That ſome who are pious, do at Times, greatly decline in Religion. And, 2d, That to reduce them, the Almighty ſends many and great Afflictions. And, 3d, That when theſe are ſanctified, they diſpoſe them to return to their firſt Huſband, becauſe it was better with them then, than now. Having ſpoken upon the Subject of Backſliding, in the preceeding Diſcourſe, I ſhall wave the firſt Propoſition entirely, and proceed to the two remaining: The firſt of which is,</p>
            <p>THAT to reduce pious People from their Wanderings, the Almighty ſends many and great Afflictions upon them, he <hi>hedges up their Way with Thorns, and makes a Wall.</hi> He embarraſſes the Councils, croſſes the Meaſures, and diſappoints the Expectations of his backſliding People; he at firſt, lays leſſer Sorrows upon them, in reſpect of their Names, Bodies, Eſtates, or Relations, to keep them from their IDOLS; but if this Method, fails of Succeſs, JEHOVAH ſends heavier Calamities, and raiſes ſuch Barriers
<pb n="378" facs="unknown:008266_0415_102E54FDEE4133A8"/>
in their Way, as they cannot ſurmount, to gratify their perverſe Inclinations; which through the dreadful Influence of long De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, and violent Temptation, they are in a Manner bent upon; <hi>if his People Sin againſt him, he will chaſtiſe their Iniquities with Rods, and their Tranſgreſſions with Stripes; if they walk contrary to him, he will walk contrary to them, and puniſh them ſeven Times for their Iniquities.</hi> And indeed no other Method will promote their Intereſt; for a Series of eaſy Honour and Proſperity, in this Situation, would but increaſe their Pride, Senſuallity, and Ingratitude: The fatter they grow, the more with <hi>Jeſhurun,</hi> they kick againſt the tender Bowels of their Benefactor; and therefore he multiplies Diſtreſſes upon them, until they come to their Senſes, humble themſelves before him, and ſtop in their wicked Career: And ſome Times they are ſo ſenſual and ſtupid, that one or two Diſtreſſes do not anſwer the End; but <hi>Deep muſt call unto Deep,</hi> before they awake to purpoſe, and turn to their God! Well if the Caſe be ſo, that the Deſign of the Almighty in afflicting us, is to reduce us from our Wanderings to his Boſom, that he may impart ſublimer Sweets, than this Earth affords; if he <hi>chaſtens us, that we may
<pb n="379" facs="unknown:008266_0416_102E55008C6C82F0"/>
not be condemned with the World?</hi> What Reaſon then have we to bleſs him for his fatherly Love and Care, and ſubmit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Murmuring to his Rod? <hi>We have had Father's of our Fleſh, who corrected us, and we gave them Reverence, ſhall we not much rather be in Subjection to the Father of Spirits, and live? Heb.</hi> 12. <hi>Why ſhould a living Man complain, a Man for the Puniſhment of his Sins?</hi> Let us then <hi>humble ourſelves under the mighty Hand of God,</hi> ſtretched out in perſonal, domeſtic, or national Calamities, <hi>that in due Time he may lift us up.</hi> I proceed to the</p>
            <p n="2">2. PROPOSITION, <hi>viz. That when Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſanctified, they diſpoſe pious Perſons to return to their firſt Huſband, becauſe it was better with them then, than now.</hi> The Truth of this Propoſition, is ſufficiently evident from the Text. Here let us enquire, 1ſt, When Afflictions are ſanctified? 2d, What Sort of a Huſband Chriſt is? 3d, What it is to return to him? And, 4th, Open the Force of the Spouſes Enducement, by ſhewing in Contraſt, wherein it appears better to be near Chriſt, than to be far from him. I return to the</p>
            <p n="1">1. PROPOSED, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſhew when Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are ſanctified. Now this is, 1ſt, When we diſcern GOD to be their AUTHOR; <hi>is
<pb n="380" facs="unknown:008266_0417_102E55032CC22CF8"/>
there any Evil in the City, and I have not done it, ſaith the Lord (Amos</hi> 3.6.) That is, EVIL of PUNISHMENT; for moral Evil, the Almighty cannot be acceſſary to, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his infinite Purity: We are apt to pore too much upon the immediate Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our Sorrows, while in the mean Time, we overlook the ſupream Director of all Events, who juſtly puniſhes us by them; this fooliſh Conduct tends to leaven our Minds with Revenge againſt our Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Creatures, to our own Prejudice; but when we look above them all to God, and conſider that he uſes them, as a <hi>Rod</hi> in his Hand, to chaſtiſe us for our Offences againſt him, and that however unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Inſtrument is, God is righteous; this Method calms the Soul. And, 2d, When we diſcern our <hi>Sins</hi> to be their <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing Cauſe, ſurely againſt me is he turned,</hi> ſaith the Church. 3d, When we diſcern <hi>Reformation</hi> to be their <hi>Deſign,</hi> and that they come from fatherly Love; <hi>whom God loveth he chaſtens, and ſcourges every Son he receiveth, Heb.</hi> 12. And, 4th, When we endeavour ſincerely to comply with this Deſign, by <hi>humbling</hi> ourſelves under <hi>God's Hand,</hi> confeſſing our Sins, and bewailing them, confeſſing the Righteouſneſs of God's Judgments, and our Inability to deliver
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:008266_0418_102E5505C3C3C690"/>
ourſelves from them, <hi>praying</hi> frequently and earneſtly for <hi>Forgiveneſs, Iſ.</hi> 26.16. <hi>by reſolving and endeavouring to reform from the Cauſes of God's Diſpleaſure,</hi> without De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, and with full Purpoſe of Heart; in this Way, we may Hope for Relief, upon an infallible Foundation, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.14. <hi>If my People which are called by my Name, ſhall humble themſelves, and pray, and ſeek my Face, and turn from their wicked Ways, then will I hear from Heaven, and forgive their Sin, and heal their Land.</hi> When <hi>Ahab</hi> humbled himſelf, though a bad Man, the Almighty took Notice of it, and would not inflict the Judgments threatned in his Day; and of the <hi>Ninivites,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>Jon.</hi> 3.10. <hi>God ſaw their Works, that they turned from their evil Way, and repented of the Evil that he ſaid he would do unto them, and did it not:</hi> Now if the Almighty takes ſuch favourable Notice of the Humiliation and Reformation of unregenerate Perſons, will he not much more of his own People? Yes ſurely; but without this, our Miſeries will be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.15. I proceed to the</p>
            <p n="2">2. PROPOSED, which was to enquire, <hi>what Sort of a Huſband Chriſt is?</hi> The dear Redeemer is a <hi>Huſband honourably deſcended,</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> by <hi>Nature,</hi> he is <hi>amiable</hi> in
<pb n="382" facs="unknown:008266_0419_102E55085E3A6740"/>
all Reſpects, as <hi>God,</hi> he poſſeſſes all his Father's Excellencies; as <hi>Man,</hi> he is holy, harmleſs, undefiled; as <hi>Mediator,</hi> the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatical <hi>Union</hi> of the human and divine Natures in his ſacred Perſon, his <hi>Offices,</hi> his <hi>Sufferings</hi> for poor Sinners, and <hi>Obedience</hi> in their Room and Place, render him wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and amiable; eſpecially when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Fullneſs and Suitableneſs of the one, and the Depth and Deſign of the other, together with the Majeſty of his Perſon, and the Meanneſs and Vileneſs of thoſe he came to ſeek and ſave; he is inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſibly <hi>rich,</hi> beſides the Riches of his Godhead, which are immenſe and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible; <hi>all Fullneſs dwells in him as Mediator;</hi> he is Lord of the Univerſe, and King of the Church; all <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> are under his Check, and at his Diſpoſal; he is the <hi>Reſurrection and the Life,</hi> and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the Keys of Hell and Death; <hi>the Law was given by Moſes, but Grace and Truth came by Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> his ſpiritual <hi>Riches</hi> are ſublime, ſatisfactory, eternal! He is an <hi>affectionate Huſband,</hi> who loved us with an everlaſting Love, and therefore with loving Kindneſs has drawn us; his Regard to us before Time, is the Source of all the ſpecial Kindneſſes he ſhews us in it: He loved us in our <hi>Blood.</hi> and bid us live; and
<pb n="383" facs="unknown:008266_0420_102E5509DFCBEC50"/>
has given the moſt ſubſtantial Expreſſions of Affection, by aſſuming an inferior Nature for us, and enduring therein an accurſed Death, by bearing with innumerable Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſſes in us, and after repeated Breaches of Covenant, by inviting us to his Embraces, <hi>thou haſt played the Harlot with many Lovers, yet return to me, ſaith the Lord;</hi> O glorious Grace and Love!—As he is the <hi>Wiſdom of God,</hi> ſo he is <hi>the Power of God,</hi> able to break the Bars of Death, and conquer the Powers of Darkneſs, able to do abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly above what we can aſk or think.— He is a <hi>generous Husband,</hi> he makes his <hi>Bride</hi> comly, through his Comlineſs, and though ſhe brings nothing with her but Deformity and Guilt, he bequeaths upon her a Dowry or more Value than Millions of Worlds! He is an <hi>everlaſting Husband,</hi> the Alpha and Omega, Death that diſſolves the tender Ties of other Relations, ratifies this; which much commends its Worth. Now to be <hi>married</hi> to him, ſuppoſes a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce from the governing Love, and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Practice of <hi>Sin (Pſ.</hi> 97.10. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.18.) as well as from the <hi>Law,</hi> in reſpect of Dependance (<hi>Phil.</hi> 3.7.) and ſuch a Diſcovery of his Excellency, Ability, and Love, as excites earneſt Deſires after him (<hi>Philip.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Acts</hi> 11.23.) and
<pb n="384" facs="unknown:008266_0421_102E550C8486CC58"/>
implies a deliberate, unreſerved <hi>Conſent,</hi> to accept of him as a Huſband, with a fixed Reſolve to perform the Duties of a Wife, <hi>viz.</hi> Love, Reverence, Obedience, and an inviolate Adherence to the Marriage-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; the Conſequences of which, are Fellowſhip in his Love, and a conſcienci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Endeavour to perform the Duties of Marriage, 1 <hi>John,</hi> 1.3. <hi>Acts</hi> 24.16.— But I proceed to the</p>
            <p n="3">3. PROPOSED, which was to enquire, what it is to return to him. This includes a clear and diſtreſſing Diſcovery of the Miſeries of his Abſence, compared with the <hi>Comforts</hi> of his Preſence; ſerious Deliberation thereupon, together with an affectionate Bewailing over our Sins, the Cauſes of his Departure from us. In this Caſe, the awakened Penitent, with <hi>Ephraim,</hi> bemoans himſelf, pours out Floods of Tears, and fills the Air with Sighs and Groans; he determines to forſake all his Sins in general, and his Conſtitution Sin in particular, and to perform all the Duties required of him, at all Adventures; his Soul goes out after the dear Redeemer, with vehement Sallies, and renews with Freedom its Conſent to the Articles of the Marriage Covenant, and is laborious in performing the other Duties enjoined, to obtain an Aſſurance of his Love, and to
<pb n="385" facs="unknown:008266_0422_102E5511603B6B48"/>
walk worthy of it; now this Duty ſhould be done without the leaſt Delay, and with the moſt determined Purpoſe of Heart, and truly that is the Caſe, when the holy Spirit diſcends from on High. The</p>
            <p n="4">4.

In his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi> we have the following valuable <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, viz.</hi> 1ſt, <hi>Reſt;</hi> thoſe that do believe, ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>enter into Reſt;</hi> they have not only a Right to, and Proſpect of Reſt in another World, but poſſeſs a Degree of it, amidſt the Sorrows and Labours of this; <hi>return to thy Reſt, O my Soul,</hi> ſaid the Pſalmiſt, <hi>for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee;</hi> he had wandered from his God, and ſought for Reſt among Creatures; but being diſappointed of his fond Hopes, and tired with his vain Purſuits, he returns aſhamed of his Sin and Folly to his God, and having obtained the Light of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, reſts under the Shadow of his Wing, and in the Embraces of his Boſom. 2d, <hi>Delight;</hi> I ſat down <hi>under his Shadow with great Delight,</hi> ſays the Spouſe, <hi>and his Fruit

Have we diſcerned God to be their Author, our Sins to be their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing Cauſe, and Reformation their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign? And have we endeavoured to comply with this Deſign, by humbling ourſelves under God's Hand, by praying to him, by reſolving to reform, and by executing this Reſolve? If the Judgments of God upon us, have not hitherto had theſe ſalutary Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, for God's Sake let us bewail our Sin and Miſery, and pray and ſtrive for the Sanctification of our Sorrows; if we regard either our own Comfort, or Safety, the Honour of God, the Weal of his Kingdom, or the Deliverance of our Nation from threatened Ruin! 2d, Let us enquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we are married to Chriſt, or not? To give Light to this important Inquiry, it is neceſſary to aſk our Souls the following Queſtions? Have I been divorced from the governing Love of every Sin? And from the Law as a Covenant of Works? Have I had ſuch a Diſcovery of the Excellency, Ability, and Willingneſs of Chriſt to ſave, as has excited inſatiable Deſires after Union to him, as a Huſband; Communion in his

Love, and Conformity to his Life? Have I pondered upon the Terms of Marriage, and conſented without reſerve to deny myſelf, take up the Croſs of Chriſt, and follow him; conſented to embrace him in all his Offices, and Relations, with a fixed Purpoſe to perform faithfully and conſtantly to him the Duties of a Wife? And in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the aforeſaid Cloſure, have I Fellowſhip in his Love, and do I make Conſcience of performing the Duties of Marriage? It is with the utmoſt Seriouſneſs and Impartiallity, we ſhould examine this Point, my Brethren, becauſe upon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſion of it, depends our eternal All. 3d, Let us enquire, if there be not ſome among us (who are married to the Lord JESUS CHRIST) that have backſlidden from him, in the Manner before repreſented? Thoſe I would earneſtly invite and urge to imitate the noble Example mentioned in our Text; ſay from the Heart, <hi>I will go and return to my firſt Husband, for then was it better with me, than now:</hi> Thou knoweſt by ſweet and ſad Experience, the Truth and Force of this Argument; which, methinks, might be ſufficient, without the Addition of any other, to reduce thee from thy Strayings to thy God, thy Duty, thy Honour, thy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and thy Happineſs!

But can't you cry after him, and bewail your Inability, as well as the Cauſes of his Abſence? Has he not promiſed to meet thoſe, that wait upon him in his Way?

            <p>THE PHARISEES were a Sect of People among the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were very ſtrict in obſerving the Ceremonies of that Inſtitution, ſuch as waſhing before Meat, making broad their Philacteries, tything Mint, Annis and Cummin; nevertheleſs divers of them were lax in Morals, and cover'd their Wickedneſs with a religious Maſk; <hi>they neglected the

weightier Matters of the Law,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Mercy and Faith (i. e.</hi> Juſtice, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Faithfulneſs) and were unmerciful and fraudulent in their Dealings with Mankind, <hi>made long Prayers</hi> to get a Fame for religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and thereby have the Eſtates of Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and Orphans committed to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, and ſo devour them: They were alſo very proud and cenſorious, <hi>ſought Honour of Men</hi> immoderately, were indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious in pulling MOATS out of others Eyes, while there was a BEAM in their own; they boaſted of their own Goodneſs, and deſpiſed thoſe who excel'd them in ſome reſpects; <hi>I faſt twice a Week, I am not as this Publican!</hi> And in order to ſcreen their Wickedneſs the better from public Obſervance, they labour'd to <hi>corrupt</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> by their falſe <hi>Gloſſes,</hi> and make it a Noſe of Wax, an Inſtance of which we have in our Context, Verſe 43. <hi>You have heard that it hath been ſaid, thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour and hate thine Enemy;</hi> theſe Words, <hi>and hate thine Enemy,</hi> are not in the Law refer'd to (<hi>Levit.</hi> 19.18.) they are either their Addition to the Law, or falſe Interpretation of it: In Oppoſition hereto, our Saviour enjoins his Diſciples <hi>to love their Enemies,</hi>—and offers ſeveral reaſons to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force this Command, among which this is

one mention'd in our Text, <hi>viz.</hi> that they ſhould go beyond the Publicans; <hi>do not even the Publicans the ſame?</hi> But who were theſe PUBLICANS? I anſwer; they were civil Officers appointed by the <hi>Romans</hi> who at that Time had ſovereign Dominion over the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> State) to gather the public revenues, the chief Commiſſioners were Knights and Gentlemen of <hi>Rome,</hi> who either farm'd out theſe revenues to others, or employed others under them in collecting of them: Some that were thus employed were <hi>Jews,</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Zaccheus,</hi> and ſome <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi> many of theſe civil Officers were too ſevere in their Exactions, which procur'd an Odium upon the whole Order, and hence they are commonly join'd in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with Sinners and Harlots.

be exceſſive, as the Word <hi>Wrath</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, it ſhould not be laſting: Anger or reſentment about private Affairs is much more difficult to manage than Anger about public Matters: Nor does the Precept I am ſpeaking upon oppoſe our hating God's Enemies as ſuch; no, in Proportion to our Love is our Zeal <hi>(Qui non zelat, non amat) Do not I hate them that hate thee?</hi> ſaid the Pſalmiſt (<hi>Pſ.</hi> 139.21, 22.) We may ſeek a due Revenge of God's Honour upon ſuch, though private revenge is forbidden, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are not our own Judges; as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Society we have committed that Matter to the Determination of others; and though we ſhould bear ſmaller and tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Injuries for the Sake of Peace, yet we are not prohibited by this Precept from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Law,</hi> and ſeeking Satisfaction in a Way of public Juſtice, but with a Mixture of Charity, elſe we are unjuſt to ourſelves. Two Arguments are propoſed in our Text and Context by our Saviour to enforce this Precept of Love to our Enemies, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That we may reſemble God our Father; as he has a common Love which is extended to all Mankind, in ſupplying their Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with the Light and Warmth of the Sun and with the Rain, as well as a ſpecial Love and Favour, which he exerciſes only
<pb n="403" facs="unknown:008266_0440_102E55400EFD0170"/>
towards thoſe that are good; ſo ſhould we, in Imitation of him: Though we are not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to take Enemies into the ſame Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity with others, yet we ſhould love them in their order; as our Heavenly Father, though he will one Day have a Satisfaction from Sinners for the Wrongs done to his Majeſty, except they repent, yet in the mean Time he confers upon them the good Things of common Providence, and on ſome the Means of Grace: Thus, though we are bound to ſeek ſome Satisfaction for public Injuries to the divine Honour from flagitious Sinners, and likewiſe the reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of private important Injuries againſt ourſelves in an orderly Way, yet we ſhould love them in Conſiſtency herewith, that ſo we may imitate our heavenly Father, and prove ourſelves to be his Children. And, 2. That we may do more than others, <hi>For if ye love them that love you, what Reward have you? Do not even the Publicans the ſame? And if ye ſalute your Brethren only, what do you more than others?</hi> q. d. Reaſon obligeth you who expect a reward from God for what you do, to do ſomething more than others who know of no ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or at leaſt live in no Expectation of it; and you who condemn others as great Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſhould do ſomething to exceed them,

both in Offices of Piety towards God, and Charity towards Men: But if you only ſhew Kindneſs to your Relations and Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, you do no more than thoſe you look upon as Heathens.

him to Heaven: You ſhould not leave all this Work to Miniſters, for you have a Charge, as well as they; faithful Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of this Kind, would yield us the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt Delight, which Succeſs would increaſe! As to the Church in its preſent low State, ſhould not our Hearts be tenderly concerned? Many in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Dominions have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken the principal Doctrines of Chriſtianity, the Power of Piety languiſhes; the Miniſtry of the Word, is generally like a miſcarrying Womb, and dry Breaſts; divers pious Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple removed, and but few converted of late, and all this in a Time of awful Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments! O ſhould not theſe Conſiderations excite us to ſpeak in the Prophet's Language, <hi>For Jeruſalem's Sake, I will not hold my Peace, and for Zion's Sake, I will not be ſilent, until the Righteouſneſs thereof go forth as Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the Salvation thereof as a Lamp that burneth?</hi> And in regard of the <hi>Nation,</hi> how do our Enemies triumph over us? God is certainly angry with us, and threatens to take away our civil and religious Liberties at a Stroke, and yet we remain generally ſtupid and unreformed, do not regard the Opperation of his Hand, or turn to him that ſmites us. O let us <hi>cry between the Porch and the Altar, that God would ſpare

            <p n="2">2d PROPOSED, which was to give the REASONS of this POINT; here obſerve, that GOD REQUIRES IT OF US, <hi>What do ye more than others?</hi> He alſo EXPECTS IT, and that reaſonably; for <hi>what could he have done more for his Vineyard than he has done?</hi> And <hi>he comes Year after Year ſeeking Fruit;</hi> which if he does not find, what can ſuch CUM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERERS of the GROUND expect, but to be CUT DOWN? Is it not juſt and reaſonable, that Fruit be proportioned to the Means of Fruitfulneſs? Hereby <hi>God's Name</hi> will be <hi>honoured; John</hi> 15.8. <hi>Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much Fruit:</hi> And hereby <hi>God's Kingdom will be promoted.</hi> Such a Life will incline us hereto, and give Weight and Authority to our Words. In this Way, WE ourſelves ſhall FIND REST to our SOULS, and enjoy a Heaven upon Earth. The Reaſon why we have ſo little Comfort in Religion, is becauſe we are no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious. Weak Grace is difficult to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by ourſelves and others, and the Evidences of it are eaſily darkened, but it is not ſo when Grace is ſtrong: Beſides the Lord will not be behind-hand with us in this Life, he will graciouſly Reward his Peoples Painfulneſs and Fidelity in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;

he will give them more frequent Views of that immortal Bleſſedneſs, to which they are haſtening, and in which they ſhall be for ever inſtated, after a few Moments are elapſed.</p>
            <p>WE <hi>Profeſs more,</hi> and <hi>have promiſed more than others,</hi> and therefore it is but reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and decent, that we do more.—WE <hi>expect more,</hi> and therefore ſhould do more, if not, our Expectations are irrational.— WE <hi>know more</hi> than <hi>others,</hi> and therefore ſhould exceed them in Practice; without this our ſuperior Intelligence anſwers no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable End, but is a Loſs, inſtead of a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit: <hi>For he that knows his Maſter's Will, and does it not, ſhall be beaten with double Stripes.</hi>—OTHERS <hi>expect more of us,</hi> who if they are diſappointed, are prejudiced againſt Religion, and <hi>induced</hi> to believe that there is nothing in it, but Words and Pretences. In fine, hereby our future <hi>Happineſs</hi> will be increaſed, the <hi>Degrees</hi> of which will be proportioned to our Advances in Holineſs here, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.16.17.</p>
            <p>FROM what has been ſaid, we ſhould be excited to propoſe this ſolemn Queſtion to ourſelves, What do we more than others? Do we exceed them in the Inſtances before mentioned, or not? Wherein do we live

Our <hi>Leanneſs,</hi> our <hi>Leanneſs, teſtifies againſt us;</hi> the gracious <hi>God</hi> has taken much Pains with us, by his Word, Ordinances, Providences, and Spirit, but to how little Purpoſe? Where is our Growth in Grace, our abundant Life, our much Fruit? What have we done for God, and his Kingdom, in all the Space that he has given us? What Ignorance, Pride, Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhneſs, raſh Judging, Selfiſhneſs? What Backbitings, Swellings, and Tumults do abound? How little Love to God and Man? How little Faith, Holineſs, Humility, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venlineſs, Mercy, Meekneſs, Forbearance? O that my Head was Waters, and mine Eyes a Fountain of Tears, that I might weep Day and Night, for my own Sins, Weakneſs, Unfruitfulneſs, and for the Sins of others! Alas, our Time and Talents, have been in a Manner loſt, and the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty has been watering an almoſt <hi>dry Stick;</hi> except we ſpeedily repent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, there is Reaſon to fear, that the righteous God <hi>will take away the Hedge of this Vineyard, and let it be eaten up; and break the Wall thereof, and let it be trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

Remember there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the firſt Works; or elſe I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtick out of his Place, except thou repent. Remember therefore how thou haſt received and heard, and hold faſt, and repent. If therefore thou ſhalt not watch, I will come on thee as a Thief, and thou ſhalt not know what Hour I will come upon thee. (Rev.</hi> 2.4, 5. and 3 Chap. 3 Ver.) We are now loudly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon, by the JUDGMENTS of GOD, to humble ourſelves before him, and reform what is amiſs in our Conduct. In one Word, SIRS, Heaven and Earth, God and Man, our own Intereſt, and that of the Church and Nation, concur to invite and urge us to grow in Grace, and do more than others. Which may GOD of his Mercy, help us to comply with. AMEN, and AMEN.</p>
