            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THAT Generation of the <hi>Braelites</hi> that Entered into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> carried themſelves com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendably; and though they had Infirmities, yet they walked before God in much Integrity: But <hi>Joſhua</hi> lived but Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen Years after their Entrance into <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:001234_0003_0FB182ACAC0178F0"/>and within a while the reſt of that Generation were carried to their Graves: After them aroſe a Generation of another Spirit; the conſequence whereof we have in this Verſe.</p>
            <p>Here are, 1. the Criminals. 2. The Crime.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Criminals, or perſons that were guilty: the Children of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> Had it been the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> or <hi>Moahites,</hi> or <hi>Ammonites,</hi> it had not been ſo ſtrange; but they were the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Poſterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> the People that God had made glorious diſcoveries of himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, the people that had been inſtructed in the Will of God. Again, they were the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> not a few of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> not one or two Towns, not <hi>Ramah,</hi> or <hi>Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem,</hi> or <hi>Hebron,</hi> not one of the Tribes, but it was a general Defection.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Crime: 1. In general: they did Evil in the ſight of the Lord, they ſinned under the eye and obſervation of God; it may be ſome of them might do it in a more ſecret way, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17. 9. <hi>The Children of</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael <hi>did ſecretly thoſe things that were not right;</hi> but they did it in the ſight of God. Again, they did evil in the ſight of the Lord; that is, they did that which was evil in his ſight: it may be in their own eyes, it might ſeem good, they thought there was no hurt in it;
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001234_0004_0FB182AE568A33E0"/>but it was evil in the ſight of the Lord: Again, they did evil in the ſight of the Lord; they carried ſo as to provoke God to anger there was always ſin and infirmity among them; but now they were ſo bad, that God was provoked by their carriages; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns them as a people of a corrupt carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. 2. In particular, they ſerved <hi>Baalim. Baal</hi> ſignifies Lord, <hi>Baalim</hi> Lords; there were many of them, as <hi>Baal Peor, Baal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rith, Baal Zebub:</hi> by <hi>Baal</hi> you may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the <hi>Sun,</hi> it was worſhipped by divers Nations, under divers forms and repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> imitated them.</p>

               <q>The Covenant People of God do ſometimes grow very corrupt in a little time.</q>
               <p>When the former Generation were dead that came into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> they did evil in the ſight of the Lord: People are wont to be very inconſiſtent in goodneſs; as they are ſubject to many other changes, ſo to changes in Religion; Piety is not natural to a people, and ſo they do not hold it long; ſometimes when a people are grown cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, they hold that a great while; but when they are holy, it is not long before
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001234_0005_0FB182AFAE9717F0"/>they loſe their holineſs; it is otherwiſe with particular perſons that are once holy, ſuch men will continue to be holy all the days of their lives, but if a people be an holy people, many times they loſe it quickly; it is eaſy to go down hill: people are apt to grow degenerate; one would have thought, conſidering the piety of thoſe that went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Divine Conſtitution of their Church, the great manifeſtations of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God to that Nation, that they would have held their Religion from Generation to Generation, but it was otherwiſe.</p>

            <div type="answer">
               <head>ANSWER.</head>
               <p>The principal occaſion is, that Godly men Dye, and there riſes up an Unconvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Generation in their room: many other things may meet together to help forward this Degeneracy; there be many temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that fall in to promote this corruption, as the example of Neighbouring Nations, the temptation of Wealth, the evil Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are broached by particular perſons; but the main reaſon of the degeneracy is
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001234_0006_0FB182B124289780"/>that Good men dye, and go to Heaven one after another, and there riſes up another Generation that are Unconverted, and they corrupt themſelves; they are born in Sin, and continue in their natural condition; they profeſs holineſs, but are not holy, and ſo the Land is corrupted; Judg. 2. 10. <hi>There aroſe another Generation that knew not the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This occaſions Degeneracy theſe ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Hence they want Grace to reſtrain them in a Day of Temptation.</hi> In length of time there will ariſe conſiderable temptations, but if a people be gracious, it is hopeful, that they will withſtand thoſe temptations: Gracious men will not live in evil ways: 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>He cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God:</hi> they have a principle of faith, and do believe the dangerouſneſs of evil ways, and will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid: <hi>Job</hi> 31. 23. <hi>Deſtruction from God was a terrour to me;</hi> and they hate ſinful ways, and cannot endure them, they are like green wood that will not take the fire ſo readily as others: but if a temptation comes, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal men have not grace to reſtrain them, they have natural conſciences, and a care of their reputation, but they want the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal thing to reſtrain them; it may be they will be commanded to do that which is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and they have not grace to withſtand the command: <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5. 11. <hi>Ephraim is oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001234_0007_0FB182B52A6D6788"/>and broken in judgment, becauſe he willingly walked after the commandment,</hi> i.e. <hi>of Jerebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> Mic. 6. 16. <hi>The ſtatutes of</hi> Omri <hi>are kept, and all the works of the houſe of</hi> Ahab. It may be there will ariſe ſome falſe Teachers, and many carnal men will fall in with their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions, 2 Tim. 3. 6. <hi>Of this ſort are they that creep into houſes, and lead captive ſilly women, laden with ſins, led away with divers luſts.</hi> If perſons don't fear God, they are liable to greateſt iniquities in a day of temptation; Gen. 20. 11. <hi>The fear of God is not in this place, and they will ſlay me for my wives ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There will be many bad Examples.</hi> Where there be many holy men, they will be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good examples to others, they will walk in fear, carry humbly, and glorify God; Acts 24. 16. <hi>Herein do I exerciſe my ſelf to have a conſcience void of offence, towards God and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards man.</hi> Where there be plenty of Holy men in a Land, there will be many good examples; men will be provoking one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother to an holy emulation: but where there be few good men, there will be a ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of good examples; many men will give bad examples, and others will be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to follow them; eſpecially the younger ſort of people; men are apt to follow the multitude: when they ſee others ſin, they are taught to ſin; the pride of others draws
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001234_0008_0FB182B668F8D4A0"/>out their Pride, &amp; the covetouſneſs of others draws out their coveteouſneſs, as the fire in the coals draws out the fire that is in the wood: bad examples make men think, that there is no great danger in ſin: bad examples make men think, ſinful practices to be honourable, hence in time ſins grow natural.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>They will indulge their Children in Evil.</hi> Godly men may be too indulgent to their Children; but more generally Godly men will be careful in the Education of their Children, Gen. 18. 19. <hi>Abraham will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his Children and his Houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep the ways of the Lord. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was very careful to principle <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 4. 3, 4. So was <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> Prov. 31. 2, 3, 4. They are ſolicitous for Gods Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the Salvation of their Children, and will be creful in Educating of them; but if the Generation be carnal, they will be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in Educating them; they would have them be good husbands, and follow their buſineſs diligently; and they can't a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide that they ſhould do any thing that ſhould occaſion them to be fined; but there be abundance of miſcarriages that they do not much regard; they don't much mind it, if they be rude and misbehaved, if they run abroad in the night time, and be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from Family Prayers, if they be vain
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001234_0009_0FB182B7E883E320"/>and proud, and don't ſanctify the Sabbath carefully; and if <hi>they</hi> do indulge their Children in evil, they will grow very bad: Children will be very corrupt, if not well governed; Eccleſ. 11. 10. <hi>Childhood and Youth are vanity;</hi> Prov. 29. 15. <hi>A Child left to himſelf, bringeth his mother to ſhame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Godly men that are among them will be tainted.</hi> When a Country abounds with Godly men, they will ſtir up one anothers graces, they will quicken and confirm one another, and ſtrive to excel: but when they are generally a carnal people, it will be a wonder, if they do not taint thoſe that be good; ſweet liquor put into a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt veſſel will be tainted; ſo Good men in a corrupt Town or Country. It is true, that when wicked men carry very filthily, that does by an <hi>Antipariſtaſis</hi> ſtir up the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Godly men; Pſal. 119. 126, 127. <hi>They have made void thy Law, therefore I love thy Commandments above gold.</hi> But when men are carnal, and carry on a profeſſion of Religion, their miſcarriages do mightily taint Godly men, the air of the Country is infectious, and ſound men may be infected thereby; <hi>Joſeph</hi> learned to Swear in <hi>Egypt; Barnabas</hi> was carried away with the diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation; <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 13. Some of the good
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001234_0010_0FB182B9634B6E50"/>King of <hi>Judah</hi> did not take away the High Places.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Duties of Religion are much neglected.</hi> Holineſs teaches men to be much in them; Pſal. 122. 1. <hi>I was glad when they ſaid to me, let us go up to the houſe of the Lord:</hi> Pſal. 27. 4. <hi>One thing have I deſired, and that will I ſeek after, to dwell all the days of my life in the houſe of the Lord.</hi> But there is a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable neglect of duties of Religion: the Scripture is not duly read in many Families;
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001234_0016_0FB182C4B409B378"/>if they do Pray, that is all: many men make little uſe of their Bibles: God requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the King <hi>to read in the law all the days of his life,</hi> Deut. 17. 18, 19. And many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple don't love days of Faſting: they are contented to go to Lectures, where after the Service they can viſit their Friends, and be kindly entertained; but they are backward to have Communion with other Churches in this duty of Faſting; or to attend the ſame at home, but only when they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by Authority; and ſeldom do any thing privately this way: it was otherwiſe with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 35. 13. <hi>I humbled my ſoul with Faſting.</hi>

But here is not due care about it: beſides, other miſcarriages that are more particular: Men do take a mighty liberty in their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes on that day; this is a ſpreading diſeaſe in the Land: between the Exerciſes they will talk of any thing, they will Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of their Corn and Hay, and the prizes of Commodities, of almoſt any thing that they diſcourſe of on Working dayes: they
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001234_0017_0FB182C62FCDC330"/>are mute about what they hear, and run into impertinent diſcourſes. It were a fault in <hi>Boyes,</hi> but <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Women</hi> are guilty, yea ſuch as pretend high to Religion are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly culpable in this thing.

Men would count themſelves impriſoned to be reſtrained from Worldly idle talk upon the Sabbath. The Country is alſo very faulty in not Sanctifying days of <hi>THANKSGIVING</hi> according to Gods appointment: Dayes of <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dayes as well as dayes of <hi>Faſting:</hi> They are expreſsly called <hi>Sabbaths, Lev.</hi> 23. 39. And there is a prohibition of Servile work there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, <hi>verſe</hi> 35. But ſome People allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to do Servile Work; &amp; in many places there is but one Meeting, (if it be excuſable in ſome Towns, yet it is not in others) thereby young People have opportunity to meet together, and ſpend ſome part of the

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Abundance of Men are not Moral Men:</hi> there be many groſs immoralities in the Land, as Swearing, Drunkenneſs, Fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; theſe things are indeed puniſhed when they do appear: but a great deal never comes to light: but beſides theſe groſſer iniquities, there be many other Moral e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils that do abound: and many that make high pretenſions to Religion are guilty of them: many of our Profeſſors are not tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Moral men: they will talk rudely, they are not punctual to their Word, they do not honeſtly pay their Debts, they do not attend Family order, they are not faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in their dealings, they will venture to ſpeak beyond the bounds of Truth, they are not fair dealing men: if the fear of God did prevail in the hearts of men, they would be of a more becomming Converſation: flouriſhing Grace would make men more exact in their Walk. The Goſpel teaches men to carry holily: <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11, 12. <hi>The Grace of God teaches us to deny ungodlineſs and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this preſent world.</hi>
