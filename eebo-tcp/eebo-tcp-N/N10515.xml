            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <bibl>PSALM cxix, 134.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>Deliver me from the oppreſſion of</hi> MAN, <hi>ſo will I keep thy precepts.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN ſeaſons of great difficulty and diſtreſs we are very apt to look too much to ſecond cauſes, and to forget that whatever evil or calamity is brought upon us, the hand of the Lord is in it, and that it is to him that we muſt ultimately repair for ſuccor and deliverance. In vain is ſalvation hoped for from the hills or from the multitude of the mountains: In vain is it to truſt in men of "low degree who are vanity, or in men of high degree who are a lie, and if they are laid in the ballance are altogether lighter than vanity." There is none we can repair unto with any probability of ſucceſs, but unto him who is "wiſe in heart and mighty in ſtrength," who is a moſt merciful and compaſſionate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and who ſtiles himſelf the "judge of the fatherleſs and the oppreſſed."</p>
            <p>WE ought to eſteem it an unſpeakable pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege that we are allowed, in all our ſtraits and perplexities, to ſeek to "the father of lights" with hopes of audience and acceptance, through Chriſt the glorious mediator.</p>
            <p>THE Pſalmiſt was a pattern of prayer and of filial truſt and confidence in God, as the all wiſe and moſt powerful deliverer of his people. In
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013329_0004_0F8FFA5F08801A08"/>
the verſe immediately preceeding our text, he prays that his life and converſation might be regulated and directed by the rules and max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims of God's holy word. In our text he looks to God to deliver him from thoſe injuries and abuſes to which he was ſubjected from men. <hi>Deliver me from the oppreſſion of man:</hi> By this he probably intended, the perſecution of Saul, his cruel and moſt inveterate enemy, who, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all his profeſſions of friendſhip and regard for him, continually ſought his life. The Pſalmiſt adds, <hi>So will I keep thy precepts.</hi> By this he does not intimate, that he would not keep them, if he was not delivered from the oppreſſion of man; becauſe a due obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the precepts of God was indiſputably incumbent on him at all times, and under all circumſtances: but the meaning is, that if he was delivered he would endeavor to ſerve God with greater vigor and chearfulneſs than ever before; and that he ſhould look upon this as a freſh obligation to devote himſelf entirely to the honor and ſervice of God.</p>
            <p>IN further diſcourſing upon the words, I ſhall endeavor to ſhew,</p>
            <p>I. WHAT is to be underſtood in general, by the oppreſſion of man.</p>
            <p>II. THAT deliverance from the oppreſſion of man is a bleſſing to be ſought for from God. <hi>Deliver me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>III. THAT while we ſeek deliverance from the oppreſſion of man, it is fit that we ſhould engage to ſerve God with freſh vigor and diligence upon the obtainment of it. <hi>So will I keep thy precepts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. WE are to conſider what is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in general by the oppreſſion of man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:013329_0005_0F8FFA61934282F0"/>
'THIS is the depriving perſons, either of their properties or privileges, in an unjuſt and violent manner. Men are guilty of oppreſſion whenever they offer violence to men's bodies, to their eſtates or to their conſciences, or in any way whatever deprive them of any of thoſe enjoyments to which they have a juſt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputable right. Whenever men endeavor to cruſh and overburden their fellow creatures, as the Egyptians did the Hebrews, by rigorous and unreaſonable requirements; or when they impoſe upon the conſciences of men, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them becauſe they differ in opinion from them, they juſtly deſerve the name of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors.'</p>
            <p>"THIS is an abuſe of that power, which is committed to men ſolely for the good of others, to unjuſt and uncharitable uſes," to the injury and ruin of thoſe whom it was deſigned to protect and ſupport. When we conſider men as partaking of the ſame common nature, as being mutually dependant upon one another for their happineſs, and as being alike ſubject to the calamities and diſtreſſes of this mortal life; we might naturally be led to ſuppoſe that they would have a tender affection for each other, and do all that lies in their power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote one another's beſt intereſt. But the conduct of mankind in all ages, utterly diſappoints theſe reaſonable expectations. The great and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful have always been diſpoſed to trample upon thoſe who are in a weak and defenceleſs ſtate. Therefore God hath enjoined it upon his people, not to oppreſs the widow nor the fatherleſs, the ſtranger nor the poor.<note n="*" place="bottom">Jer, vii. 6. Zac. vii 10.</note> Thou ſhalt neither vex a ſtranger nor oppreſs him, ſays he, for ye were ſtrangers in the land of Egypt. Ye ſhall not afflict any widow nor
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013329_0006_0F8FFA62AAF22018"/>
fatherleſs child; if thou afflict them in any wiſe, and they cry at all unto me I will ſurely hear their cry.<note n="*" place="bottom">Ex. xxii. 21.</note> As men are naturally upon an exact equality, none can have any right to ſtrip others of any of thoſe advantages which they enjoy: nor has any one any juſt authority over his fellow creatures, which is not deligat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him by common conſent, for the general welfare and happineſs. Whenever therefore, thoſe who are exalted to places of power, act contrary to this great end of their inſtitution, they are no other than tyrants and oppreſſors. And indeed power is of ſuch an encroaching nature, that a great part of mankind are now abſolutely ſubject to the will of others. How few nations are there left wherein there is the leaſt ſhadow of civil or religious liberty! What innumerable multitudes are there now groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the inſupportable load of tyranny and perſecution! In this view the Apoſtle's language is applicable; 'the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.'<note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. viii. 22.</note> God has in his all wiſe providence ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered his true ſaints and ſervants to be greatly oppreſſed and perſecuted. Many of them have not only been deprived of every enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life, but have been put to death, in a moſt cruel and mercileſs manner, on account of their adherence to the truth.</p>
            <p>IT is obſervable that there are no creatures that inhabit the earth that prey upon one another, except men; every other ſpecies of creatures ſeems to be tender of thoſe of the ſame kind; but men who are endowed with reaſon and underſtanding and created in the image of God, ſeem to delight in horraſſing and deſtroying one another. The oppreſſion of man is the moſt intolerable that we can be
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:013329_0007_0F8FFA634CD66850"/>
ſubjected to. It cannot therefore be thought ſtrange that the Pſalmiſt earneſtly deſired that he might be delivered from the oppreſſion of man. This leads to obſerve,</p>
            <p>II. THAT deliverance from the oppreſſion of man, is a bleſſing to be ſought for from God. <hi>Deliver me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>IT may be proper here to conſider the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar fitneſs and propriety of applying to God for deliverance from the oppreſſion of man; and the temper and diſpoſition with which we muſt implore this bleſſing of God, if we would hope to obtain it. I. We are to conſider the peculiar fitneſs and propriety of applying to God for deliverance from the oppreſſion of man.</p>
            <p>THE glorious excellencies and perfections of God, render him the ſuitable and infinitely worthy object of our adreſſes and ſupplications. He not only knows all thoſe difficulties and diſtreſſes to which any of his creatures are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, but he is alſo perfectly acquainted with the beſt means for their deliverance. He knows all the poſſibilities of things, and can ſo order and over-rule the courſe of events, that thoſe things which were deſigned for evil, ſhall be of permanent and laſting advantage. When Joſeph's brethren deprived him of his liberty and ſold him for a ſlave, they were influenced merely by an envious, malicious ſpirit; but it was ſo over-ruled by God as to be the means of ſaving them and their's from ruin. Joſeph therefore, ſays to his brethren, now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourſelves that ye ſold me hither; for God did ſend me before you to preſerve life.<note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. xlv. 5.</note> God can eaſily "take the wiſe in their own craftineſs," and "turn their counſels into fooliſhneſs." He knows how to make light ariſe in the midſt of the groſſeſt
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013329_0008_0F904DED9BFC42C8"/>
darkneſs; and can eaſily find out means for the deliverance of his people, when all human wiſdom is totally at a non-plus.</p>
            <p>THAT God is an omniſcient being, is one good reaſon why we ſhould look to him for deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erance, under great difficulties and diſtreſſes. Whatever ability or diſpoſition any one might have to help us, if he was unacquainted with our circumſtances, and the means neceſſary for our relief, it would ſignify nothing. But ſince all our wants are "naked and open before God," and "our ſecret groanings are not hid from him," there is good reaſon to ſeek earneſtly to him for deliverance from thoſe evils to which we are, or may be ſubjected. Moreover it is highly fit and neceſſary that we ſhould ſeek to God for deliverance from the oppreſſion of man, becauſe he is an all-powerful being. God hath ſpoken once, (ſays the Pſalmiſt) twice have I heard this, that power belongeth unto God.<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm lxiii. II. lxxxix, 8, 13.</note> "O Lord God of hoſts, who is a ſtrong Lord like unto thee? Thou haſt a mighty arm, ſtrong is thine hand and high is thy right hand. The hearts of all men are "in the hands of the Lord and he can turn them as the rivers of water are turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;" he can alter their views and purpoſes, and cauſe that "our enemies ſhould be at peace with us." The greateſt earthly Princes and Potentates are abſolutely ſubject to his direction and controul; he can ſay unto them, hitherto ſhall ye come and no further, and here ſhall your proud waves be ſtayed. God can with the utmoſt eaſe, baffle all the deſigns that earth or hell can form againſt his people. His almighty power has oftentimes been illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triouſly diſplayed in behalf of his oppreſſed and perſecuted people; and he has fully evinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the admirable works which he hath
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:013329_0009_0F8FFA6411964608"/>
done, that he is "the Lord God Omnipotent," who ruleth in the kingdoms of men, and "doth according to his will, not only in the armies of heaven, but alſo among the inhabitants of the earth." How weak and defenceleſs ſoever his people may be, God can eaſily, if he pleaſes, work out deliverance for them. It may be, ſays Jonathan to his armor-bearer, that the Lord will work for us, for there is no reſtraint to the Lord to ſave by many or by few.<note n="*" place="bottom">I Sam. xiv. 6.</note> He can work deliverance with means or without, juſt as beſt comports with his ſovereign pleaſure. If therefore, the eternal God be our refuge, and underneath be the everlaſting arms, we need not ſear what man can do unto us; for all human power united, is leſs than nothing and vanity, when ſet in competition with the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God. All human power is derived and limited; whereas the power of God is inherent and abſolute. When Pilate boaſted that he had power, either to crucify or releaſe our bleſſed Saviour, he checked his inſolence, by telling him that he could have no power againſt him, except it were given him from above.<note n="†" place="bottom">John xix. 10, 11.</note> Thoſe who are veſted with the higheſt powers on earth, cannot do any thing without the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of God. As therefore God is an omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent being, and exerciſes an uncontroulable ſway over all his works, it is highly fit and reaſonable that we ſhould look unto him for deliverance from the oppreſſion of man; that we ſhould cry mightily to God to vindicate our cauſe, and to command ſuccor and deliverance for us. Though the profane and irreligious may ſcoff at, and deride us, and ſtigmatiſe us with the opprobrious names of hipocrites and enthuſiaſts, becauſe we faſt and pray when under oppreſſion (as has of late been the practice
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013329_0010_0F8FFA64CC893698"/>
of ſome on the other ſide the atlantic) yet let us not ceaſe to pour out our hearts before God, who is "able to do for us exceeding abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly above all we can aſk or think."</p>
            <p>ANOTHER reaſon why we ſhould ſeek to God for deliverance from the oppreſſion of man, is, becauſe he is a merciful and compaſſionate being, and is ever diſpoſed to pity and relieve thoſe that are oppreſſed. He is "good unto all and his tender mercies are over all the works of his hands," and is ever diſpoſed by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity of his nature to promote the welfare and happineſs of his creatures.

            <p>THE compaſſion of God was wonderfully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played towards the people of Iſrael, when op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and afflicted with the Egyptian bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and he brought them out "with an high hand, and an outſtretched arm" and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly diſmayed their enemies.—This is the language of God with reſpect to his afflicted perſecuted people: I have ſeen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt; I have heard their groaning and am come down to deliver them.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Acts vii. 34.</note> We need not recur to ancient times to
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013329_0011_0F8FFA6591101E48"/>
find proof of the readineſs of God to interpoſe for the ſuccor and deliverance of his people. He has at ſundry times and in divers manners appeared for the people of this, at preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed land, and has wrought out deliverance for them. When "they were few, yea, very few" and ſtrangers in the land, he appeared in great mercy for them, fought their battles, and "drave out the heathen before them, and gave them this good land for a poſſeſſion;" he "bare them as on eagles wings," carried them through innumerable difficulties and hardſhips, and "ſaved them from all that was their fear." When in an arbitrary and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potic reign they were threatned with the loſs of all thoſe precious privileges, which they came into this howling wilderneſs peaceably to enjoy, how remarkably did God appear for them, and by introducing a glorious revolution in the nation, ſave them from impending ruin! In what a ſignal and memorable manner did God appear for this people when a foreign enemy was making a violent deſcent upon them, and had arrived at their very borders! How did he ſcatter and deſtroy them, and cauſe the few that ſurvived the ſtorm and peſtilence to return home aſhamed!</p>
            <p>NOW God is the ſome wiſe, powerful and compaſſionate being that he ever was. His hand is not ſhortned that it cannot ſave, nor his ear heavy that it cannot hear; nor is he leſs diſpoſed to deliver thoſe that truſt in him than he ever was. We have therefore, abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant reaſon to look to him in all our ſtraits and difficulties, and to adopt the prayer of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Deliver me from the oppreſſion of man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I PROCEED as was propoſed,</p>

2. To point out the temper and diſpoſition with which we muſt ſeek to God for deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from the oppreſſion of man, if we would hope to obtain it. Though God is a moſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful and compaſſionate being; "good and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to forgive and plentious in mercy to all that call upon him;" yet if we do not ſeek him in an humble, penitent and obediential manner, there is no probability that we ſhall find audience and acceptance with him. It is requiſite that we ſhould eye the hand of God in all thoſe difficulties and diſtreſſes in which we are involved: that we be deeply humbled on account of our ſins which may have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked him to viſit us with his judgments, and that with unſeigned repentance we return unto him from whom we have revolted, and reſolve to ſerve him for the future with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er diligence and activity. Let us conſider theſe things a little particularly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is neceſſary that we eye the hand of God in all thoſe difficulties and diſtreſſes that are brought upon us. The pious David conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered all the oppreſſion and perſecution to which he was ſubjected, as being permitted of God. When the impious Shimei came out and curſed him amidſt all his diſtreſs, he would not ſuffer vengeance to be executed upon him, but ſays, the Lord hath bid him curſe; <hi>i. e.</hi> the Lord permitted him and gave him an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to vent his malice. David did not ſcorn theſe curſes, ſays one,<note n="*" place="bottom">Biſhop Patrick in Loc.</note> as coming from the hand of a vile wretch not worthy to be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but acknowleges the juſtice of them, and bears them with ſingular patience, out of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and reverence to God who had ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it. Thoſe things are oftentimes ſaid in
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013329_0013_0F8FFA6683AFEC88"/>
ſcripture to be effected by the agency of God, which he permits to be done by others as a puniſhment of the ſins of particular perſons or of a whole community<note n="*" place="bottom">See Pſ. cv. 25. Iſ lxiii 17. Jer. iv. 10. vi. 14.</note> Shall there be evil in the city, ſays the prophet, and the Lord hath not done it? I form the light and create darkneſs; I make peace and create evil; I the Lord do all theſe things.<note n="†" place="bottom">Amos. iii. 6. Iſ. xlv. 7.</note> Theſe and ſuch like expreſſions do not indicate that God ſtirs up and excites men to oppreſs and perſecute one another, or to do any thing which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the obligations of righteouſneſs and mercy: For if they were under a fatal neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of doing theſe things, they would not be in the leaſt culpable; but God would be the poſitive, efficient cauſe of ſin. But the truth is, God leaves men to themſelves and permits them, in compliance with their own corrupt paſſions, to oppreſs and perſecute others, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to humble them for their ſins, or to anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer ſome other important purpoſes in the moral government of the world. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of God, does not in the leaſt vindicate the conduct of tyrants and oppreſſors; but they will be juſtly ſubjected to aggravated wrath for thoſe very acts of rage and cruelty, which were over-ruled by God for the welfare and happineſs of his people. Judas went to his own place, though the horrid deed which he committed operated for the ſalvation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. It is ſaid that Chriſt was "crucified and ſlain by wicked hands," notwithſtanding "the determinate counſel and foreknowlege of God." Though we may have juſt reaſon to complain of, and condemn the conduct of thoſe who injure and oppreſs us; yet we muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlege the juſtice of God in permitting, thoſe calamities to befall us. This brings me to obſerve,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:013329_0014_0F904DEFA81AF7C0"/>
2. THAT we muſt be deeply humbled on account of our ſins which may have provoked God to viſit us with his judgments. It is ſin that ſeparates between God and his people and hides his face from them that he will not here. All thoſe judgments with which men are at any time viſited, are, no doubt, deſigned as a puniſhment of their ſins. Natural evil in the univerſe is the effect of moral. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we are oppreſſed and afflicted, it is highly fit and neceſſary that we ſhould humble our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under the mighty hand of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our ſins, and that we ſhould recollect and call to mind what we have done to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke a holy God to come out againſt us in his hot diſpleaſure. If we preſume to juſtify our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before God, and deny that we have deſerved his judgments, there is no probability that our prayers will meet with his gracious acceptance. Though the people of this land may, conſidered in a comparative view, be a virtuous and religious people; yet, it muſt be acknowleged that iniquity greatly increaſes and abounds among us. Our forefathers were eminent for their piety and goodneſs, and their zeal for the worſhip of the living and true God: but we are greatly degenerated, and are become a wicked and perverſe generation. What im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety and profaneneſs, what intemperance and debauchery, what injuſtice and cruelty are there prevalent in our land! With what neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and contempt are the word and ordinances of God treated by many! How is family reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion gone to decay, and how little care is there taken to inſtill the principles of virtue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion into the riſing generation! How many are there, who, notwithſtanding they "pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to know God and Chriſt," yet in works de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them; and ſo bring a great ſcandal upon
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:013329_0015_0F8FFA67AC16F4F0"/>
the religion of Jeſus! Yea, are there not ſome who openly reject all revelation, and deny that they ſtand in any need of inſtruction and illumination from above?</p>
            <p>IF one of our pious anceſtors was to return from the inviſible world, how ſurpriſed and aſtoniſhed muſt he be, to behold the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and degeneracy of the men of the preſent day; and with what fearful apprehenſions muſt he be filled, leſt the wrath of God ſhould be executed upon ſuch a ſinful people! With what earneſtneſs would he intreat them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member from whence they had fallen, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and do the firſt works!—The deſign of this days ſolemnity is, that we may humble ourſelves before God, on account of the ſins that prevail in our nation and land, among all ranks and orders of people; and eſpecially that every one may humble himſelf for his own iniquity. Let us carefully examine our own temper and converſation, to ſee how far we in particular have contributed to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking a holy God to viſit us with his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Let us adopt the penitential language of Ezra, and ſay each one for himſelf, O God, I bluſh and am aſhamed to lift up my face to thee, my God; for our iniquity is increaſed over our head and our treſpaſs is grown up unto the heavens. Though we are in an afflicted and diſtreſſed ſtate; yet we muſt acknowlege that God has puniſhed us leſs than our iniquities deſerve. Let us glorify him in the day of viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and learn obedience by the things we ſuffer, either as individuals or as a people. By obedience is not meant ſubmiſſion to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous decrees of men; but to the juſt and holy laws of God, whoſe ſervice is moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and ſatisfactory, and in keeping whoſe commands there is great reward.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:013329_0016_0F904DF19D9E4298"/>
I PROCEED to obſerve,</p>
            <p n="3">3. THAT if we would hope to obtain deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from the oppreſſion of man, we muſt with unfeigned repentance, return to God from whom we have revolted. Though we ſhould confeſs our ſins and pray earneſtly to God for the remiſſion of them, yet if we go on in the practice of iniquity it will avail nothing. We muſt break off our ſins by righteouſneſs, and our iniquities by turning to the Lord with our whole hearts. Evangelical repentance conſiſts in a thorough change of heart and life, a turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the love and practice of iniquity, to the love and practice of univerſal holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Let the wicked forſake his way, ſays God by his prophet, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord and he will have mercy on him; and to our God for he will abundantly pardon. Return ye now every one from his evil way and make your ways and your doings good.

            <p>GOD ſends his judgments on a people on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to humble and reform them, to bring them nearer to himſelf, and ſo to render them the ſuitable objects of his favorable regards. When therefore theſe important moral pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes are anſwered, he is ready to remove thoſe calamities to which his people have been ſubjected. Yea, ſo great is the mercy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of God, and ſuch his readineſs to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, that when he has threatned a people with utter and irrevocable ruin, their ſpeedy repentance and reformation has prevented
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:013329_0017_0F904DF2DCE2AF10"/>
the execution of his wrath. At what inſtant, ſays he, I ſhall ſpeak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom to pluck up and to pull down and to deſtroy it; if that nation againſt whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil way, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.<note n="*" place="bottom">Jer. xviii. 7, 8.</note> The readineſs of God to ſave a repenting people from impending judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments was wonderfully diſplayed in the caſe of Nineveh, a city which on account of the ſins of it's inhabitants was threatned with ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and utter deſtruction. When the wrath of God was denounced againſt them by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Jonah, it is ſaid, that they believed God and proclaimed a faſt, and put on ſackcloth from the greateſt to the leaſt of them; for the word came unto the King of Nineveh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And they ſaid, who can tell if God will turn and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and turn away from his fierce anger that we periſh not. We read that God ſaw their works, that they turned from their evil way, and God repented of the evil that he had ſaid that he would do unto them, that he did it not.<note n="†" place="bottom">Jonah iii. 5. and onward.</note> We have abundant encouragement, if we repair unto God in a humble, penitent manner, deeply ſenſible of our own unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs and guilt, and with effectual purpoſes of reformation and amendment, that God will hear our cries and ſend us gracious anſwers of peace: but he has declared, that if we regard iniquity in our hearts he will not hear us nor anſwer our requeſts. All our addreſſes to God will be mere hypocriſy, and our truſt in him for ſuccor and deliverance, ſinful preſumption; if we do not ſincerely endeavor to obey his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred commands. If ye be willing and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, ſays he to his choſen people, ye ſhall eat

            <p>LET us now proceed, as was propoſed, in the</p>
            <p>III. AND laſt place to ſhew, That while we ſeek deliverance from the oppreſſion of man, it is fit that we ſhould engage to ſerve God with freſh vigor and diligence upon the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it. <hi>So will I keep thy precepts.</hi>—We are very apt to forget to "render to God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to benefits received." When we are in difficult and diſtreſſed circumſtances, we are ready to think that if God will but extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate us here from, we will "ſerve him in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and righteouſneſs all the days of our lives." But ſuch purpoſes and reſolutions are too apt to be forgotten by us. It is obſerved of God's ancient people, that they forgat God their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, who had done great things for them in the land of Egypt. Many times did he deliver them, but they provoked him with their counſel and were brought low for their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.<note n="†" place="bottom">Pſ. cvi. 21, 43.</note> It muſt be acknowleged that we, as a people, have not taken a ſuitable notice, nor made a proper improvement of paſt mercies and deliverances. When God has delivered us from the oppreſſion of man, and extricated us out of other difficulties in which we have been involved, we have not been led to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, nor engaged to love and ſerve him who has been the "rock of our ſalvation." We have "ſang his praiſe, and ſoon forgot his works." This argues great vileneſs and ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; becauſe our obligations to love and obedience are enhanced in proportion to the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:013329_0019_0F8FFA680F82F668"/>
bliſſings which God confers upon us. It is worthy of particular notice here, that the Pſalmiſt plainly intimates, that if he was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the oppreſſion of man, he could much more eaſily keep the precepts of God than while ſubject to it. "The oppreſſion of man is a great impediment and hindrance to our performing the duties of religion, and takes us off from many opportunities of ſerving and honoring God. If it does not altogether hinder us from attending upon the duties of religion, yet it tends to diſtract our minds, to diſcompoſe our ſpirits, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our readineſs and chearfulneſs in the ſervice of God King Solomon has therefore obſerved, that oppreſſion will make a wiſe man mad.<note n="*" place="bottom">Ecc. vii. 7.</note> It fills men with fiery zeal and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, ſo that they are in a manner tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported beyond themſelves; eſpecially when baſe indignities are put upon them, and they are treated with all manner of inſolence and contempt! Oppreſſion has a moſt pernicious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon religion, as it takes off our atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the important concerns of it; as it excites our angry paſſions, occaſions unchriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an heats and animoſities, deſtroys brotherly love, and even common friendſhip and good agreement, and as it contracts the ſphere of our uſefulneſs in the world. The Pſalmiſt therefore might ſafely engage, that if he was delivered from the oppreſſion of man, he would keep God's precepts. He would have much better ability and greater opportunity for it. Let us endeavor to imitate him in this pious reſolution, and while we ſeek deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, ſolemnly engage that we will endeavor
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:013329_0020_0F904DF4EA5F9860"/>
to love God more intenſly and to ſerve him with greater diligence and fidelity than ever before.</p>
            <p>THUS we have conſidered the ſeveral things at firſt propoſed, and nothing now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, but that we apply theſe truths to our own particular circumſtances. It is too evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to be denied, that we are a people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the oppreſſion of man. The heavy hand of power is lifted up againſt us, and we are in a very afflicted, perſecuted condition. The government in the mother country ſeems greatly incenſed againſt the people of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince in a particular manner; and if we were to judge by ſome late decrees of the Britiſh ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, it ſeems as if they were determined to exterminate the very idea of freedom from among this people. It muſt be owned that many things have been ſaid and done among us very inſolent and abuſive, and which, it were ſincerely to be wiſhed, had been left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done. We have not behaved ourſelves ſo wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and prudently as we might and ought to have done but too many have improved their liberty as a cloak for licentiouſneſs.</p>
            <p>BUT what was it that raiſed ſuch a diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ungovernable ſpirit among this people, but acts and decrees which were judged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with "that liberty where with we were made free." There was not a more peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able people upon the face of the earth, than the inhabitants of theſe American colonies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore laws were made on the other ſide the water to impoſe unconſtitutional taxes, and violently extort our property from us. Before this, a moſt happy harmony ſubſiſted between the mother country and the colonies: they
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:013329_0021_0F8FFA6A891729E8"/>
delighted in mutual good offices and "ſought the things that made for peace." We rejoic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the friendſhip and protection of the parent ſtate, and gloried in the welfare of the land of our forefather's ſepulchres. But alaſs! theſe halcyon days are paſt, and it is queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able whether we ſhall live to ſee them return. A foundation ſeems to be laid for a long and violent ſtruggle which threatens the ruin of both countries. The people in this land being the deſcendants of anceſtors who fled from their native country, to eſcape the cruel hand of perſecution, have a high ſenſe of liberty and freedom, and any "yoke of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage" is peculiarly galling to them. Every invaſion of their rights brings to mind the horrid cruelty and barbarity which was exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed upon our forefathers, and which finally drove them to take up their reſidence in this howling wilderneſs; thinking themſelves ſafer among ſavage beaſts, and yet more ſavage men than among their kindred according to the fleſh. As they underwent every kind of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty and hardſhip, in order that they might peaceably enjoy civil and religious liberty, and tranſmit the ſame as an invaluable inheritance to their poſterity, it cannot be ſuppoſed that we ſhall very readily ſubmit to arbitrary and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potic power. It is ſtrongly to be ſuſpected, that whoever concerted the late violent and coercive meaſures, is not only an enemy to the liberties of America, but alſo to the welfare of the nation. The intereſts of the two countries are inſeparably connected: the ſame weapon that ſtabs America, pierces the vitals of Britain. Had not the loyal ſubjects of our moſt gracious ſovereign in this province been greatly traduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:013329_0022_0F904DF5B6842570"/>
and vilified, and their deſigns moſt ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly miſrepreſented, it is not ſuppoſeable that he, who ſtiles himſelf the father of his people, would have granted his royal aſſent to ſome late acts which muſt moſt deeply diſtreſs many of his innocent ſubjects. But however it may have come to paſs, the three branches of the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature ſeem to be united againſt us: and the few friends we have to plead our cauſe are utterly unſucceſsful in their moſt vigorous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to preſerve our conſtitutional rights. The capital of this province is inveſted in a hoſtile manner, without the inhabitants being indulged an opportunity to vindicate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or to make ſatisfaction for injuries ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by individuals. Thouſands of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent perſons are at one ſtroke deprived of the means of ſubſiſtence, and left to periſh with hunger, if not relieved by the charity of their friends. The widow and the fatherleſs, the aged and infirm, and the tender helpleſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant are alike involved in one common cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. If this be not oppreſſion and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is impoſſible to ſay what is. This is a decree not to be parralleled in the hiſtory of any free people; if it was ever equalled among the moſt barbarous nations. It is neceſſary to ſpeak freely; if we were to be ſilent at ſuch a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as this, there would be reaſon to expect that the very "ſtones in the ſtreet would cry out." And as if this ſevere and mercileſs edict were not ſufficient, behold! ſeveral others are paſſed, levelled not againſt a particular town, but againſt this whole province. Our moſt valuable charter rights are wreſted from us without our being offered an opportunity to make any defence; and the King's repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:013329_0023_0F8FFA6BA9C7FFC8"/>
is veſted with very extraordinary powers, utterly unknown before, either in Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain or America. And in order to put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution theſe decrees, a fleet and army are ſent among us that all reſiſtance may be effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevented.</p>
            <p>Now can we conſider theſe things and not be convinced that we are under the oppreſſion of man: can we help trembling for fear that our precious rights and privileges will at length be all extorted from us, and that we ſhall be reduced to a ſtate of abject ſlavery? Can we help trembling for the ark of God, the intereſt of religion, at ſuch a ſeaſon as this is? Our civil and religious privileges are cloſely and inſeparably connected; if we give up the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er we cannot expect long to enjoy the latter. There are ſome who have, no doubt, a very jealous eye upon the eccleſiaſtical conſtitution of the churches of New-England, and would rejoice to introduce the Epiſcopal government here, from the tyranny<note n="*" place="bottom">If any ſhould think this expreſſion in any degree exceptionable; let them attend to the treatment the non conformiſts received under the adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of the Arch-Biſhops, Parker, Bencroft, Laud, &amp;c. as it is related by impartial hiſtorians of thoſe times. No reflection is however, deſigned to be caſt upon the preſent adminiſtration of Epiſcopal government; though it muſt be owned that the eſtabliſhment of Epiſcopacy in this country, would be very diſagreable, and is greatly deprecated by the people in general, eſpecially in the New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land government.</note> of which, in former reigns, our forefathers took ſanctuary in a deſart.</p>
            <p>To whom ſhall we repair in this day of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and gloomineſs, of clouds and thick dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,

but unto God, the ſupreme ruler and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of the world, who can, with the utmoſt eaſe, command ſuccor and deliverance for us; who can diſconcert the moſt ſubtle devices: who can cauſe light to ariſe in the midſt of darkneſs, and bring great good out of evil? To him let us addreſs our earneſt ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and put our confidence "under the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of his wings, till theſe calamities be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt." "It is better to truſt in the Lord than to put confidence in man; it is better to truſt in the Lord than to put confidence in Princes." Let us then in an humble, penitent, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ential manner, depend upon "the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah, with whom is everlaſting ſtrength," for help and ſafety. Though we have been a ſinful and ungrateful people, yet ſuch is the goodneſs and mercy of God, that there is great reaſon to hope that he will in ſome way or other appear for us, and defeat the deſigns of thoſe who ſeem to be inimical to us. It may not be amiſs to obſerve here, that the preſent meaſures have in all probability ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated directly counter to the expectations of thoſe who concerted them. In attempting to cruſh one province, excluſive of the reſt, they, no doubt, ſuppoſed, that the others would reſt eaſy, apprehending that their own commerce might be increaſed and their particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt advanced: but behold! how the wiſe are taken in their own craftineſs. The very meaſure which was probably deſigned to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a union, is like to produce a moſt firm, and we truſt indiſſoluble one. The ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral provinces on the continent view it as one common cauſe, and ſeem reſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to ſtand or fall together; and it is ſincerely to be hoped that under God, this

may prove the means of ſalvation to this whole people.—Who knows but that the preſent troubles and diſtreſſes may operate for our good, conſidered with reference to our preſent intereſt, by teaching us induſtry and frugality, and leading us to retrench many of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities of life! If luxury and extravagance were to increaſe among us, in the proportion they have done for ſome years paſt, we ſhould in all probability be in a great meaſure ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without the concurrence of any other cauſes. But it would be preſumption in us to pretend exactly to determine what the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of God's providence are: this however we know, that he has promiſed that "all things ſhall work for good to them that love him." If we are a humble, penitent, obedient people, he will not leave nor forſake us; but will be "our refuge and ſtrength, a very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent help in trouble." He will cauſe us "to know the way in which we ſhould walk," and will order every thing in great mercy to us.—Let us be deeply humbled before God on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our ſins, which are the procuring cauſes of our ſufferings; and earneſtly entreat the "father of lights" to pour out upon this people a ſpirit of grace and ſupplication, of repentance and reformation. Let us ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeavor to turn every one from his evil way unto the living and true God; and while his judgments are in the earth, let us learn righteouſneſs. God is now loudly calling upon us to "break off our ſins by righteouſneſs and our iniquities by turning to the Lord." If we conſider our ſins, either as individuals or as a people, we cannot but acknowledge that it would be juſt in God to deprive us of every privilege we enjoy, and utterly to cut us off.

But we cannot think that it is juſt in men to oppreſs and afflict us. We cannot think that on account of riots and diſorders committed among us, it is juſt that our charter rights ſhould be wreſted from us, and our civil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution utterly aboliſhed. We conceive that there is a wide and eſſential difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween power and right; and that though others may be able to oppreſs and deſtroy us, they have no more right to do it, than one man who happens to be ſtronger than his neighbor, has, to fall upon him and take away his liberty or his life. It is evidently our indiſpenſible duty to ſubmit to "every lawful ordinance of man for the Lord's ſake." But if rulers abuſe their power and invade the rights of their ſubjects, the obligation to ſubmiſſion ceaſes, and it becomes a duty to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>It is a contradiction, ſays a learned writer, to the juſtice, holineſs, and goodneſs of God, to ſay, that he hath given Princes any power to oppreſs, rob, ſpoil, murther, or to do any harm to their ſubjects.

improvement of which we are accountable to him; and he has ſaid to us, occupy till I come: we have therefore no right to give them up ſo long as it is poſſible to maintain them; if we do, we cannot anſwer it to God. We are bound to uſe our utmoſt endeavors to defend them, not only on our own account, but for the ſake of our poſterity, who are dear to us as ourſelves. Future generations are really more deeply intereſted in our conduct in this matter than we are ourſelves. The glaſs of life with reſpect to many of us is almoſt run, and we ſhall ſoon take our flight into the world of ſpirits, where "the ſervant is free from his maſter" and the "voice of the oppreſſor will be heard no more." And it is certain, that rather than be abſolutely ſubject to the will of others, a wiſe man would chuſe to be "free

If all parties would exerciſe chriſtian candor and condeſcention, it muſt be of eminent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. Let us not imagine, becauſe we have this day preſented ourſelves before the Lord, and implored his gracious ſuccor and deliverance in our preſent diſtreſſes, that there is nothing more to be done: but let us remember that we muſt be daily ſeeking to God. Every family apart, and every ſoul apart, muſt cry mightily to God in ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing ſeaſon as this is.

Whatever hardſhips and ſufferings we may be ſubjected to, let us never murmur nor repine at the hand of God, but glorify him in the day of viſitation.
