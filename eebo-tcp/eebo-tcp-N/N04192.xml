            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Enquiry into ENTHUSIASM.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Corruption and Depravity of humane Nature is a Thing ſo plainly diſcovered and ſo frequently acknowleged, that it is needleſs to endeavour to prove it.</p>
            <p>And tho' Man be evidently ſuch a Stranger to GOD and ſuch an Enemy to him, yet there is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſuch a <hi>ſtrong Inclination</hi> in the Hearts of Men to <hi>ſomething</hi> that is called RELIGION, as makes it Matter of Admiration to all wiſe and conſidering Perſons.</p>
            <p>Indeed <hi>true Religion</hi> is ſo <hi>heavenly and divine a Thing,</hi> and bears ſuch a Reſemblance of the <hi>true</hi> GOD, that it may ſeem very <hi>ſtrange</hi> indeed, that there ſhould be <hi>any Inclination</hi> in the Hearts of Men to it. And yet in all Ages of the World, among all Nations, there is plainly ſo <hi>ſtrong an Inclination and Readineſs</hi> to fall in with ſomething, that bears the Name of <hi>Religion,</hi> that it is truly <hi>wonderful</hi> to behold.</p>
            <p>For there is nothing that ſo ſuddenly prevails, and like a mighty Torrent bears down all before it, as this <hi>strong Inclination</hi> does: ſo that if any come to Men under Pretence of <hi>large Communications from the divine</hi> BEING, and pretend to make them <hi>Sharers</hi> in it, this <hi>ſuddenly</hi> takes with them, and like <hi>Wild-Fire diffuſes</hi> itſelf every where.</p>
            <p>And therefore there muſt undeniably be ſome <hi>ſtrong Inclination</hi> in humane Nature that Way, or there could not be ſuch a <hi>ſudden Alteration</hi> made among Men, as there often is. I know indeed, that 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005167_0004_1016CC2007849368"/>pretended to proceed <hi>from the Power and Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of the divine</hi> SPIRIT, which makes ſuch a <hi>wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſudden Alteration.</hi> But every one muſt and and will acknowledge, that it does not always proceed from this Cauſe: for I cannot think any will be <hi>ſo diſtracted</hi> as to impute the ſudden Progreſs of the <hi>Perſian Magi,</hi> and the almoſt innumerable Heathen Religions, or the ſudden Alterations made in the Religion of the Jewiſh Nation to the Worſhip of <hi>Baal,</hi> or <hi>Jereboam</hi>'s Golden Calves, and the ſudden Alterations made by <hi>Mahomet</hi> in Religion, and all the great and ſurprizing Alterations that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> has made in the <hi>Chriſtian Religion;</hi> I ſay, I think none will attribute all theſe to the <hi>powerful Efficacy of the</hi> HOLY SPIRIT: For there are ſo many <hi>horrible Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions,</hi> and <hi>abominable Things</hi> advanced by many, that it is <hi>impoſſible</hi> to be <hi>all divine.</hi> So that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is pretended, it muſt moſt certainly ſometimes proceed from ſome other Cauſe.</p>
            <p>There muſt then be ſomething in-laid in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Frame and Conſtitution of humane Nature, that <hi>like Tinder,</hi> muſt be ready to <hi>catch every Spark of this Fire that is ſtruck into it:</hi> For if there be not, it will be impoſſible to account for ſuch <hi>ſtrange Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances</hi> as have often happened in the World.</p>
            <p>When I have conſidered theſe <hi>ſtrange Appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> in the World in former Ages, at ſeveral diſtant Periods of Time, and many of them ſo contrary to one another; and yet as great, quick, powerful, one as the other, I could not but think that though they were ſo contrary one to the other, yet they muſt <hi>all proceed from one and the ſame Principle in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature:</hi> Becauſe they all ſeem to operate in the <hi>ſame Manner</hi> and produce much the <hi>ſame Effects</hi> among Men, and therefore I think, it may not be amiſs to enquire into this <hi>Principle, what 'tis called;</hi> the <hi>original from whence it proceeds, the Method of its
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005167_0005_1016CC22889422F0"/>Riſe and Progreſs,</hi> when it makes a <hi>great Appearance</hi> in the World, and the <hi>proper and genuine Fruits and Effects</hi> of it among Men.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Then we may enquire, <hi>what this is, which has ſuch wonderful Effects.</hi> And this I apprehend has generally gone under the Name of ENTHUSIASM, a <hi>Greek</hi> Word that in <hi>Latin</hi> is rendred <hi>Numine Affla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus:</hi> i. e. a <hi>Strong Fancy, Imagination</hi> or <hi>Conceit</hi> of having <hi>large Communications</hi> from, or <hi>Participations of the Deity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is therefore a <hi>powerful Impreſſion</hi> or <hi>Impulſe</hi> made upon the <hi>Imagination,</hi> of having ſome <hi>great and wonderful Communications</hi> from God, ſo as to be made in a very <hi>high Degree</hi> Partaker of that which is <hi>heavenly</hi> and <hi>divine;</hi> and therefore this exalts them in their own Thoughts, as being highly favoured of God, or the <hi>peculiar Favourites</hi> of Heaven; and therefore they <hi>look down</hi> upon others as <hi>poor, miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Wretches that are going down to Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this <hi>high Conceit</hi> of themſelves ſtrongly warms their Imaginations, and makes them <hi>full of Life and Fire:</hi> And therefore they look upon others as <hi>dead Souls,</hi> that partake not of this <hi>warm imaginary Fire.</hi> And this makes them evermore deſpiſe REASON as an evil and dangerous <hi>Guide</hi> in Matters of Religion, and ſubſtitute <hi>ſeeing</hi> and <hi>feeling</hi> in the Room of it, they ſee ſuch heavenly and divine Things <hi>clearly,</hi> and <hi>feel</hi> them <hi>ſtrong</hi> in their Souls, and therefore deſpiſe all <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Argument</hi> as a <hi>mean, dull</hi> and <hi>beggarly</hi> Thing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They ſee and feel</hi> (they ſay) <hi>and therefore believe and are ſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They have a <hi>quick</hi> and <hi>ſudden Way</hi> of coming at heavenly and divine Things; and this fills them with the <hi>higheſt Extacies</hi> of <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Comfort:</hi> Theſe they <hi>ſee,</hi> and <hi>feel</hi> and think they can't be miſtaken in; and therefore care not for all hat can be ſaid
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005167_0006_1016CC24E124DD00"/>againſt them: And therefore will not enquire any further.</p>
            <p>Thus I have given a brief Account of what I take to be ENTHUSIASM, which all Mankind have ſuch a <hi>Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for,</hi> and are ſo ready to fall in with; that were it not for the powerful Interpoſition of the DIVINE BEING, they would all be overwhelmed with it. For nothing is more agreeable to corrupted humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and nothing more miſchievous to it than this.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We ſhall enquire into the <hi>Original of it,</hi> or <hi>from whence this does proceed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly this was not the original Conſtitution of humane Nature. For humane Nature did once moſt ſurely partake of the divine; and had frequent and great Communications from the Deity: And this was not a <hi>meer imaginary Thing,</hi> but <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real.</hi> How then, and when <hi>came this wonderful Principle, Inclination,</hi> or <hi>Tendency</hi> of humane Nature, to be ſo firmly in-laid or interwoven into the very Frame and Conſtitution of humane Nature, that now nothing ſeems more natural to it than this, even a <hi>ſtrong In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination</hi> to <hi>ſomething they call Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many wiſe and learned Men have written of EN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THUSIASM, and diſcourſed well concerning it; but none I ever met with have ever given an Account of the <hi>Original of it:</hi> And therefore ſeem to be at a Loſs, why it ſhould ſo ſuddenly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail and bear down all before it, as 'tis evident that many Times it has done. Witneſs that of the <hi>Magi</hi> in <hi>Perſia,</hi> that of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> among the ten Tribes, and that of <hi>Baal</hi> among the ſame Tribes ſoon after, ſo alſo that of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and that of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Antichriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I think, we need not be at a Loſs, why it has done thus, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> we conſider the <hi>Original of it:</hi> And I think the Original of this ſufficiently diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005167_0007_1016CC2740DE7D08"/>to us <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.1, to 7. Here we have an Account of the firſt Temptation, that was ever offered to human Nature, to ſin; and with which our firſt Parents complied, ſinned and fell. If therefore we may judge that Man's <hi>original Sin</hi> was proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or in any Meaſure agreeable to the Temptation that was offered, we muſt conclude that ENTHUSIASM was Man's <hi>firſt,</hi> or <hi>Original Sin. Ye ſhall be as Gods,</hi> (ſaid the Temptes) that he might prevail upon our firſt Parents to eat the forbidden Fruit. i. e. Ye ſhall partake of a much <hi>larger Portion</hi> of the DEITY, or <hi>ſpiritual and divine Knowledge and Wiſdom,</hi> than ever yet ye have done. And why did they eat of it? Was it not moſt certainly for the very End and Deſign propoſed in the Temptation? even that they might <hi>be as Gods.</hi> For nothing elſe could prevail upon innocent Nature to tranſgreſs a plain poſitive and known Prohibition but this, that they might par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take more of Divinity than as yet they had done. So that they might eaſily think, that it was no Harm at all to be more like God than now they were. It muſt be ſuppoſed that Man was at firſt made in the <hi>Likeneſs of God</hi> as we read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.27. And from hence had a true and ſtrong Tendency towards God, as his proper Center; and muſt therefore deſire to be as much like him as poſſibly he could be. <hi>Satan</hi> that now deſired to deform him, could not poſſibly think of a more likely Courſe to effect his Deſign, than to come in upon this Inclination and blind it, by propoſing a more ready and ſpeedy Way of arriving to a greater Degree of this; by diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering ſomething to him, that which might have this ſudden and quick Operation, without the ſlow and ordinary Method of God's appointing and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Policy and Subtilty of Satan no leſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in hiding the Miſchief of breaking a plain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition: <hi>God knows</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that in the Day ye eat
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005167_0008_1016CC292E005E00"/>thereof ye ſhall not die, but be as Gods, knowing Good and Evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No Queſtion the Apoſtle refers to this very Time, 2 Cor. 11.14. when he ſays that Satan himſelf <hi>is transformed into an Angel of Light:</hi> Though he is here ſaid to ſpeak to the Woman in the Shape of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, yet even in that Shape he comes as an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of Light,</hi> as though he came upon a ſpecial Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand to our firſt Mother <hi>Eve</hi> to diſcover to her the hidden Virtue of this Fruit, which they knew not before. And this he informs her had the Power to aſſimilate them in a greater Meaſure to the Divine Being. And thus his Plot is deep laid; he comes as an <hi>Angel of Light</hi> with a <hi>ſpecial Meſſage</hi> from God to her, to make her more like God himſelf than ever yet ſhe had been.</p>
            <p>Now, what could <hi>innocent Nature</hi> have to fear? Here comes an <hi>Angel of Light</hi> to diſcover to her how ſhe might become more like GOD himſelf than now ſhe was; and this agreeing with the original Deſire and Tendency of her Nature, muſt appear eligible if nothing ſtood in the Way to make it appear o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe; and for this there was nothing but GOD'S revealed poſitive Prohibition, and certain ſhe was ſhe did not yet know all that was to be known, and might not ſhe think that the Meaning of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdiction was no more than that they ſhould not eat of it, until a further Diſcovery was made about it? And ſince ſhe had the Knowledge of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdiction only by Tradition from her Husband (for ſhe was not made when this Interdiction was given him) might ſhe not as well believe an <hi>Angel of Light</hi> as him, when as that <hi>Angel of Light</hi> diſcovers that which ſhould make her more like GOD, which ſhe had ſuch a <hi>ſtrong Deſire</hi> to: And therefore find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:005167_0009_1016CC2AC51B4428"/>
Thus ſhe follows the Deſire of being more like GOD in <hi>Knowledge</hi> and Wiſdom than ſhe was; and eats in Oppoſition to a plain poſitive Command of GOD: ſhe <hi>ſteps over that Order</hi> which GOD had ſet for her to walk according to; and <hi>regards not the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> that GOD had already made, and follows a <hi>new one,</hi> that ſhe know not, <hi>who</hi> it came from, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>he</hi> that brought it was <hi>ſent</hi> of GOD or no.</p>
            <p>Her <hi>Imagination</hi> had a <hi>ſtrong Impreſſion</hi> made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, that the <hi>Diſcovery was Divine;</hi> and her <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> were <hi>warmed</hi> with <hi>great Expectations</hi> and <hi>Deſires</hi> of partaking more of the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Knowledge</hi> of GOD than ever yet ſhe had done.</p>
            <p>And upon eating (no Queſtion) her <hi>Imagination</hi> was filled with <hi>great and wonderful Diſcoveries</hi> by this Means made to her, and therefore out of <hi>Love</hi> to her Husband urges him to do the like.</p>
            <p>For having found the Benefit of it, ſhe is <hi>diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> for her Husband, that he might <hi>ſhare</hi> alſo in the <hi>ſame:</hi> And therefore ſhe gives him of this ſame <hi>wonderful Fruit,</hi> and very probably relates to him, <hi>what an angelick Diſcovery</hi> ſhe had concerning it, and her <hi>own Experiences</hi> upon eating it, and by the ſame perſwades him to take and eat. And thus both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <hi>tinctured</hi> with the ſame <hi>enthuſiaſtic Spirit,</hi> they are <hi>puffed up</hi> with it, until God opens their Eyes, i. e. Awakens their Conſciences, to ſee what they had done, and then they ſoon <hi>ſee</hi> their <hi>Miſtake,</hi> when it was too late to prevent it; for then they ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves naked, i. e. Stript of thoſe Rays of Glory and Honour, which were their Cloathing before.</p>
            <p>Thus our firſt Parent's <hi>Sin,</hi> which was finiſhed or compleated, by eating the forbidden Fruit, did bear an exact Proportion to the Temptation offered. It began in <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Deſire</hi> to <hi>know more</hi> and be <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> than God had allowed them to know or be; and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005167_0010_1016CC2EA74BB528"/>was finiſhed or compleated, by acting in <hi>plain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction</hi> to a <hi>known revealed</hi> Prohibition of GOD.</p>
            <p>Thus ENTHUSIASM was Man's <hi>firſt,</hi> or <hi>original Sin;</hi> and it evermore keeps the ſame Pace, even to this Day. For to this Day it fills the <hi>Imagination</hi> and <hi>Fancy,</hi> no with <hi>real Diſcoveries</hi> of ſpiritual and divine Things; but with a <hi>Fancy</hi> or <hi>Conceit,</hi> of being made like God; and being more acquainted with the <hi>Secrets of the moſt High</hi> than others not like them are, or than GOD has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them to know or be. And it is finiſhed even to this Day, by violating the <hi>plain Revelations</hi> GOD has made to Men, and the <hi>Order</hi> he has eſtabliſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. For it always pretends a more <hi>intimate Acquaintance with Heaven,</hi> than to be <hi>tied up to ſuch Things as theſe.</hi> Thus they break the plain Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God and the Order he has eſtabliſhed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Pretence of <hi>knowing immediately from God,</hi> what Order he would have. I cannot ſee but that Man's <hi>original Sin</hi> which is imputed to, and has infected the whole Race of Mankind, was properly ENTHUSIASM. For the Account we have of it carries all the <hi>Marks</hi> of ENTHUSIASM upon it. 'Tis therefore <hi>no Wonder</hi> that all Mankind are ſo <hi>fond</hi> of it, and ſo ready to <hi>fall</hi> in with it. For this is now ſo <hi>ſtrongly riveted</hi> in the very Conſtitution of human Nature, that whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is proper to draw it forth into Act, makes <hi>Men run wild after it,</hi> as the Apoſtle intimates, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. For this has ſo <hi>diſordered</hi> and as it were <hi>intoxicated</hi> all the Powers and Faculties of human Nature, that nothing makes ſuch a <hi>ſudden Progreſs</hi> among them, as this is won't to do. No Sin does ever ſo <hi>ſuddenly prevail</hi> as this; for this is as it were the <hi>Seed</hi> and <hi>Source</hi> of all the Reſt, for a <hi>Flood of Iniquity</hi> is won't to follow a ſtrong Fit of <hi>ENTHUSIASM.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But here ſome may ſay, If this be ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to Mankind, as to be inlaid in the Frame and Conſtitution of the whole, and be as it were the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005167_0011_1016CC30347FB280"/>Source of all other Sins, what is the Reaſon that ſo many both of <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad</hi> Men appear againſt it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this I anſwer, that ſome are more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to one Sin, and ſome to another, from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Frame and Conſtitution of their Bodies. But this I take not to be the chief or main Reaſon why it is ſo, but this, viz. That God interpoſes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Flood of Ruin that the Prevalency of EN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THUSIASM would bring upon all Mankind, and that he might preſerve a Number that ſhall faithfully bear Teſtimony for him againſt all ſuch as will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>this Sin,</hi> and render them without Excuſe at laſt, becauſe both good and bad Men bore Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt it: Thus God has done in all Ages of the World, not only among his own People, as we may read in the ſacred Oracles, but alſo among the Heathen, and in later Times among the <hi>Mahometans</hi> and <hi>Papiſts,</hi> which are the two great ENTHUSIASMS now extant in the World at this Day; or at leaſt, they may be called the <hi>two greateſt,</hi> and which there is the greateſt Strife to reduce all Men to. But God has all along preſerved a Number that have <hi>faithfully</hi> born Teſtimony againſt them as a Thing very plainly oppoſite to the <hi>plain Revelation</hi> that God has made of himſelf to Sinners, and the <hi>Order</hi> he has eſtabliſhed among them.</p>
            <p>How the ENTHUSIASM which infected our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and diſordered all their Powers and Faculties of Body and Soul, ſhould be conveyed and tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their Poſterity, even to the lateſt Generation, is an Enquiry too great and difficult (it may be) to be anſwered, while this our State of Darkneſs and Ignorance remains. For though we may be unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable Arguments prove that it is ſo, yet the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> and <hi>Method how</hi> may be beyond our Depth to fathom. But thus much I think we may ſafely ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005167_0012_1016B81F92959568"/>to ſay, <hi>That God has eſtabliſhed it ſo to be, as a Fruit of the Curſe annexed to their eating the forbidden Fruit.</hi> And ſurely GOD has Power to make his Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes take Place, <hi>when</hi> and <hi>where</hi> and as <hi>long</hi> as he pleaſes. And his Juſtice herein is ſufficiently vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated by the publick and repreſentative Station in which our firſt Parents ſtood; though we are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much at a Loſs how he makes them take Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and therefore we muſt conſider that this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in that <hi>Sentence of Death,</hi> that GOD paſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mankind in our firſt Parents, upon their eating the <hi>forbidden Fruit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I think I have given a true and genuine Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>Origin</hi> or <hi>Source</hi> of ENTHUSIASM; how it <hi>firſt of all</hi> infected the humane Race; and it may ſerve to take off the <hi>Wonderment</hi> that is made at its ſo great and ſudden Prevalency among Mankind many Times: Becauſe there is <hi>ſo ſtrong and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in humane Nature <hi>that Way,</hi> that it may not ſeem ſtrange that it ſhould ſo <hi>ſuddenly blaze out,</hi> when proper Means are uſed for this End. And it might be a <hi>greater Wonder</hi> if it ſhould not, when <hi>Pains</hi> are taken to <hi>put it into a Flame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. It will now be proper to enquire into the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod</hi> of its <hi>Beginning</hi> to riſe into ſuch a <hi>Flame;</hi> and its <hi>ſudden Prevalency</hi> among Men.</p>
            <p>This indeed though more eaſily diſcovered than the Original of it, as being more near our own Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, yet has no ſmall Difficulties attending it. For though it pretends to be all <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Fire, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>feeling,</hi> yet it is always covered with <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> And the more it <hi>burns</hi> in the <hi>dark,</hi> the more <hi>violent</hi> and <hi>impetuous</hi> it grows; and the quicker and greater Progreſs it makes. And as Satan at firſt hid himſelf under the <hi>Appearance</hi> of <hi>angelick Light,</hi> when he brought ENTHUSIASM into <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> ſo do his Miniſters now, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.14. For ENTHUSIASM
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005167_0013_1016CC328F199DA8"/>evermore <hi>covers</hi> it ſelf, with a <hi>Cloak of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and divine Light;</hi> and by this it <hi>dazzles</hi> the Eyes and <hi>darkens</hi> the <hi>Minds</hi> of all ſuch as fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gaze on ſuch an <hi>angelick Appearance:</hi> And thus Multitudes of <hi>unwary Souls,</hi> are captivated by it, that have ſuch a <hi>ſtrong Inclination</hi> in them that Way. For they want nothing but a <hi>fit Occaſion,</hi> to draw it forth into Act.</p>
            <p>But though there be ſo much Difficulty in this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, we ſhall eſſay to give <hi>an Account of it;</hi> tho' it is never more <hi>diſpleaſed</hi> than to be <hi>diſcovered,</hi> for this angers ſuch Perſons moſt of all, becauſe it hurts their Deſign.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Then, we ſhall enquire into the <hi>Method</hi> of its firſt <hi>beginning to riſe</hi> and kindle into a <hi>Flame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Satan knows the <hi>Tempers, Inclinations</hi> and <hi>Diſpoſitions,</hi> of a People, and what moſt prevails among them, at ſuch or ſuch a Time, I think, none will deny me: Nor that he knows the moſt fit Time to urge his <hi>Temptations</hi> with <hi>Succeſs,</hi> and the moſt <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Inſtruments</hi> to be made Uſe of, to compaſs his Ends. All this I think will readily be granted. And I cannot think any will deny, that Satan has the moſt <hi>malicious Enmity</hi> againſt the <hi>true, pure</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> Religion of the <hi>true</hi> God, and would do all he can to overthrow it: For this appeared in his malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Endeavours, to overthrow Religion in <hi>Paradiſe</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if theſe Things be granted, it will not be ſo difficult to diſcover the <hi>Method</hi> he takes to <hi>blow up</hi> ENTHUSIASM <hi>into a Flame.</hi> For Satan narrowly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the <hi>Frame</hi> and <hi>Temper</hi> of a People about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and what <hi>Turn</hi> they are moſt of all inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to: And when he ſees his moſt <hi>proper Time</hi> to urge this Temptation with Succeſs, he chuſes out <hi>proper Inſtruments</hi> for it; whoſe <hi>Imaginations</hi> are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

And ſuch Men as theſe have a <hi>Genius</hi> to chuſe ſuch <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> that to ſuch a People are <hi>moſt</hi> taking. And when they once begin, and find the <hi>Fire</hi> to <hi>catch</hi> here and there, it encourages them to <hi>go on,</hi> and help to <hi>blow</hi> one another into a <hi>Flame.</hi> Thus it is wont to begin. But it evermore endeavours at firſt ſlily to inſinuate, that their Rulers, civil or ſacred, are <hi>corrupt,</hi> and not to be regarded, which is very <hi>taking</hi> with a <hi>diſcontented and murmuring People,</hi> that ſtand ready to believe the worſt of their Rulers. They alſo endeavour in a <hi>ſly Manner</hi> to inſinuate, <hi>that the written Word of God is but a dead Letter;</hi> and that they have by the Spirit been taught the true <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Meaning</hi> of it, (i. e. where a People have the written Word.) At firſt indeed they do this as covertly as they can, that they may not be diſcovered in their <hi>Deſign,</hi> and as the <hi>Fire</hi> prevails then more openly. And they perſwade Perſons that none but <hi>carnal</hi> and unregenerate Perſons will ſay a Word againſt them. And as Numbers are added to them, they <hi>proclaim aloud,</hi> and <hi>boaſt</hi> of what <hi>Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> they have done, and what Multitudes are made
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005167_0015_1016CC3759946E70"/>Partakers of the <hi>wonderful Power</hi> and <hi>Operation</hi> of the SPIRIT; they are become even as Gods; they can diſcern between Good and Evil, and <hi>ſee into</hi> Men's very Souls, and know what they are. Thus it <hi>begins:</hi> But then</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Method</hi> of its <hi>Progreſs</hi> and <hi>Prevalence</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to be more open. They begin very often to declaim <hi>boldly</hi> againſt <hi>Rulers,</hi> eſpecially <hi>eccleſiaſtical ones,</hi> as <hi>carnal unregenerate</hi> and <hi>wicked Men;</hi> and many of them will openly begin to declare the Word of God is <hi>uſeleſs,</hi> or of but <hi>little Service,</hi> and their <hi>ſeeing</hi> and <hi>feeling</hi> is the <hi>chief Thing</hi> to be ſet by, and they have no Need to <hi>compare</hi> this with the Word of God, for this is what they ſee (they ſay); and now they have <hi>Viſions,</hi> and <hi>Trances, Impulſes, Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations;</hi> and ſome are ready to ſet up for a Spirit of <hi>Prophecy.</hi> Now they deſpiſe the Laws of Men; and pretend <hi>Conſcience</hi> to break them. Such Things indeed they durſt not do, while their Numbers were <hi>few</hi> and <hi>ſmall,</hi> but when they are multiplied, they <hi>deſpiſe Government, and ſpeak evil of Dignities,</hi> and fill their Mouths with great <hi>ſwelling Words of Vanity.</hi> They are <hi>filled</hi> (they ſay) <hi>with the Spirit,</hi> and with heavenly and divine Things, and have a Multitude of <hi>ſweet Feelings:</hi> And now they ſee others <hi>going down</hi> to Deſtruction; and they are <hi>diſtreſſed for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> but not at all for <hi>themſelves.</hi> For they will ſcarce ever put up ſo much as <hi>one</hi> Petition for the Pardon of their <hi>own</hi> Sins: For they think they have <hi>no Need;</hi> they are already <hi>almoſt Gods,</hi> they partake ſo much of the DIVINE SPIRIT.</p>
            <p>Theſe and much more of the like Nature are ſuch plain Facts, often to be ſeen in the <hi>Riſe</hi> and <hi>Growth</hi> of ENTHUSIASM, in all Ages of the World, that none but ſuch as are beſotted with it ever will deny. And therefore I need no ſtay to prove them. For I need only appeal to the Hiſtory of the ſeveral
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005167_0016_1016CC3A80C3E470"/>Ages of the World, wherein ENTHUSIASM has riſen and prevailed; for theſe do ſufficiently confirm the Truth of all theſe Facts.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We may enquire what are the <hi>true, proper</hi> and <hi>genuine Fruits and Effects</hi> of it? There is ſuch an endleſs Variety of theſe, and full of ſuch <hi>amazing Contradictions,</hi> that a reaſonable Man would be almoſt ready to think it impoſſible for them all to proceed from <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame Principle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet ſuch a prolifick Principle of Error may well bring forth innumerable, as well as amazing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, ſince Reaſon and Judgment is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd with ſuch to hold the Reins of Government, but Fancy, Imagination and Impulſe, muſt guide and govern all.</p>
            <p>And ſhould a Man eſſay to give a Detail of all the natural Fruits and Effects of this Principle, in all its wild Excurſions, he would ſcarce know where to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, or where to end.</p>
            <p>We ſhall therefore only mention ſome few of them; out of which innumerable others do ariſe, and make ſuch ſtrange, and almoſt unaccountable Appearances in the World. And they are ſuch as theſe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. A great <hi>Contempt of all Reaſon, and Argument, or Enquiry;</hi> and comparing of Things, to make a right Judgment. This lays the Foundation for all Manner of <hi>wild, ſenſeleſs</hi> and <hi>extravagant Things,</hi> to be tho't <hi>right,</hi> purſued, and practiſed.</p>
            <p>Man's Power of Reaſoning, and perceiving the Agreement, or Diſagreement of Things, and of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring one Thing with another, was originally given him, to ſettle his Judgment right; and to prepare him for a wiſe Conduct and Behaviour. And though Sin has rendered it very lame and weak, yet it is not wholly loſt, and poſſibly God may have preſerved ſo much of it as there is left, for this very
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005167_0017_1016CC3CD79A30C8"/>Purpoſe and Deſign, that he may be capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing treated with agreeable to his <hi>original Nature.</hi> For God condeſcends <hi>now to reaſon with him.</hi> Iſa. 1.18. And that by this Means he may reſtore the Divine Image in him.</p>
            <p>But however that be, 'tis plain that there is ſtill <hi>this Power</hi> remaining, though very dark and weak. And we cannot but ſee if we read Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that the Deſign of them are not <hi>wholly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh this Candle of the Lord,</hi> as 'tis called, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.27. but to ſtrengthen it, that it may <hi>burn more bright,</hi> and clear than it did before; and furniſh it with thoſe Diſcoveries, which, in its lame, and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Condition, it was utterly <hi>uncapable</hi> of making.</p>
            <p>But ENTHUSIASM inſtead of aſſiſting, and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening this noble Power, labours to put it wholly out; and to ſet up a <hi>ſtrong Impulſe</hi> upon the Fancy or Imagination inſtead of it.</p>
            <p>For it perſwades Men to think, that this is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>and better than Reaſon;</hi> and that it affords more Light, and quicker Diſpatch in forming the Judgment, than Reaſon could poſſibly do.</p>
            <p>They therefore condemn <hi>all Reaſon</hi> as a <hi>carnal Thing,</hi> and yet ſet up their imaginary <hi>ſeeing and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> inſtead of it.</p>
            <p>Whereas ſeeing and feeling, taken in a <hi>ſtrict Senſe,</hi> and without any Figure, are nothing but <hi>carnal, and ſenſual</hi> Things. For what is ſeeing, and feeling but ſomething that relates to our bodily Senſes. And if it be ſaid that this is meant of the ſeeing, and feeling of the Soul: I would ask them, How they can diſtinguiſh this from that which ariſes from the Body? Is it not becauſe the <hi>Impreſſion is ſtrong,</hi> ſudden and violent? But is it not often ſo with thoſe of the Body? What then makes the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference? Is it imagined to be from <hi>a Spirit?</hi> But
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005167_0018_1016CC3EDC714BB8"/>how do they know it is ſo? The ſtrong Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that 'tis from <hi>a Spirit,</hi> cannot make it certain to them or others that 'tis ſo. But if it be from a Spirit, How do they know that 'tis from <hi>a good Spirit?</hi> Have not <hi>evil Spirits</hi> often Times Power to make ſuch Impreſſions? It they have not, how came the falſe Prophets of old, and the ſoothſaying Damſel mentioned in <hi>Acts</hi> 16.16. &amp;c. to have ſuch Impreſſion? How came they to ſee and feel ſuch Things as moſt certainly they did, as 'twas with <hi>A-hab</hi>'s Prophets, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.6, 11, 12, 21, 22, 23, 30. <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.14. and <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.15, 21. If this be anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered, that it is known by the Things impreſſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is contrary to the <hi>Intereſt of Satan's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> To this I anſwer, <hi>How do they know it is ſo?</hi> And therefore further ask, May we not ſay that all revealed Truths contained in the Word of GOD are contrary to Satan's Kingdom? How then came Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan by the Power of urging the Holy Scriptures to <hi>tempt our Saviour</hi> withal. <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.6. Why may not Satan urge <hi>one Truth</hi> in ſuch a Manner as to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow another <hi>more important one;</hi> and not in the <hi>leaſt</hi> hurt his own Kingdom? Why may he not perſwade Perſons to leave one Way of Sinning to faſten them more ſtrongly in another, and not in the leaſt hurt his own Kingdom? What Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage will it be to Satan's Kingdom, to fright Men from Drunkenneſs, Uncleanneſs, Lying, Stealing, vain Company-keeping, &amp;c And faſten ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in a firm Belief that his Impulſes and Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are Revelations from GOD, and Impreſſions of the Holy Spirit? And withal puff them up with ſpiritual Pride, and Self-Conceit, and not hurt his own Intereſt.</p>
            <p>I cannot ſee how, in the leaſt, Satan's Kingdom will be deſtroyed by ſuch a Method; but rather e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed by it, becauſe this is harder to diſcern,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005167_0019_1016CC40999D7308"/>and more difficult to eſcape out of the Snare. This then is the Fruit and Effect of Enthuſiaſm, <hi>to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe Reaſon as a carnal and ſenſual Thing,</hi> and ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute ſomething ſtill <hi>more</hi> carnal and ſenſual in the Room of it.</p>
            <p>And thus they put themſelves out of the Power of diſtinguiſhing what is right from what is wrong. For this cannot be done but by Man's Reaſoning and perceptive Power, by which he compares Things to form his Judgment. And by diſregarding this, they expoſe themſelves to be cheated in the moſt important Caſe. And what wild extravagant Things, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>heated Fancy</hi> and Imagination produce; that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> kept in by the Bit and Bridle of <hi>true</hi> Reaſon and Underſtanding? For this will work Wonders upon the Body as well as Mind, becauſe it ſhares ſo much of the bodily Senſes and Paſſions.</p>
            <p>It is no Ways ſtrange, if this be once let looſe from the Reſtraints of true Reaſon, that it ſhould produce <hi>Convulſions, Swoonings, Screamings,</hi> and all ſuch Things, which are the natural Effects of a warm, and wild Imagination, frighted by Noiſe, and <hi>great ſwelling Words.</hi> For 'tis natural to have <hi>ſuch Effects</hi> upon the Body as well as <hi>Trances, Viſions, Joys, and Extacies</hi> in the Mind.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But then another natural Effect of prevailing ENTHUSIASM, is <hi>Faith without a good Foundation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This indeed enters into the <hi>very Nature</hi> of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm. For as it <hi>contemns</hi> and <hi>ſlights</hi> all Reaſon, and gains its Aſcendant over all that are willing to quit the Conduct of it; ſo it makes them believe <hi>very ſtrongly without any good Foundation. Faith</hi> is evermore (when true) the yielding up our <hi>Aſſent</hi> and <hi>Conſent</hi> to any Thing truly teſtified to us by <hi>God himſelf;</hi> and therefore when Faith is true and genuine, it is always an hearty Submiſſion to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Authority,</hi> and an acquieſcing freely in thoſe
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005167_0020_1016CC4492553108"/>Revelations, or Difcoveries, God makes to us, where our natural Faculties, or Powers had not Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to diſcover them: Or in all the Obligations which both Reaſon and divine Revelation have truly made known to us. And this Principle truly fixed in the Soul, prepares us to act in due Proportion, to what God has teſtified to us. And the Reaſon why we are thus obliged to ſubmit and act, is becauſe God is the Revealer <hi>with whom it is impoſſible to lie, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, or be deceived.</hi> And it is impoſſible for the Mind thus to acquieſce, and act without thus rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſolely and entirely on the divine Authority, and there is always good Reaſon that it ſhould do ſo, wherever any Thing is <hi>revealed by God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here the great Queſtion is, How do we know that ſuch, or ſuch a Thing has the Stamp of <hi>divine Authority</hi> upon it? If it has, there the Mind may reſt ſafely. But how may this be known, for if this be not known, the Mind muſt reſt, upon a very uncertain Foundation, if it does reſt at all. But here in this important Caſe, ENTHUSIASM ever more fails of Proof, and clear Evidence. For it firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards <hi>Reaſon</hi> its old Friend, and throws it by as a uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Thing in Matters of Religion, and therefore cannot now expect that it ſhould afford its Help at a dead Lift. Indeed in the moſt important Point they bid Defiance to it, even to prove that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation is from God: and therefore do not build their Faith upon a good Foundation.</p>
            <p>Object. But it may be ſome will here object; can there be no <hi>immediate</hi> Communications from GOD to the Soul that can be perceived to be from GOD by its <hi>own Light,</hi> or by <hi>Intuition only</hi> without the Help of any Deduction of <hi>Reaſon?</hi> Was it not ſo with the <hi>Prophets</hi> of old? Did not they by <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitice</hi> Evidence, ſee it to be from God, ſo as not
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:005167_0021_1016CC471ADAB9B0"/>to be deceived, nor need the Help of <hi>Reaſon</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it?</p>
            <p>Anſw. To this I may reply, that tho' I cannot tell all the Evidence they had that their Revelations were from the true God only; yet I conceive God never left himſelf without a clear Witneſs in this Regard, nor expoſed them to the Impoſſibility of diſtinguiſhing Truth from Falſhood, and Realities from Deluſions, and that therefore in his firſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries made to them, he always gave them ſome clear <hi>rational Evidence,</hi> that it was the true GOD that ſpake to them; and did not leave them at Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in this Point, without a <hi>ſufficient Mark</hi> to make the diſtinction. He might ſo far ſtrengthen their Reaſon and Underſtanding as to perceive the clear and undeniable Agreement of his Manner of revealing himſelf with the divine Perfections, and by this ſatisfy them the Revelation was from the true GOD: And then as to after Revelations, they might by the Help of Reaſon diſcover whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Manner of their Communication did agree with the former, and by this be ſufficiently ſatisfied, that they were from God. For we can have no juſt Reaſon to think, that GOD, in communicating himſelf to a <hi>rational Creature,</hi> will not give a <hi>rational Evidence,</hi> that the Communication is certainly from him. For we plainly ſee that when he ſent his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets upon any ſpecial Meſſage to his People, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways gave them ſome <hi>authentick Seal</hi> to evidence their Commiſſion, when they were ſent to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate any <hi>new Revelation;</hi> tho' not always when they were ſent to inculcate <hi>former Revelations,</hi> that were already confirmed by undeniable Miracles.</p>
            <p>And 'tis plain and evident they never bid Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to <hi>Reaſon,</hi> as <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> are wont to do. For they ſhew us that God challenges his People to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Caſe with him, even concerning the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005167_0022_1016CC48AC2306C8"/>of the Revelation of future Things. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.21, 22, 23.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> ſhew the greateſt Ill-Nature a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and labour to perſwade Perſons to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them upon their bare Word; and therefore have no good Foundation for their Faith to ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For they lay as good a Foundation for the Faith of others as they build their own upon; which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally none at all. But if you allow them to ſtep over this Point of proving by Reaſon, that what they have is from God; then they are as glad as any to call in formerly deſpiſed Reaſon to ſupport even their worſt Extravagances many Times. But where Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is moſt of all needed, and where it might do them the moſt Service, there they condemn and defy it. Therefore you will always find an <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſt,</hi> moſt impatient of Contradiction in this Point, that the Work he admires and carries on is from God. Allow him but this Point without Proof, and <hi>rational Evidence,</hi> and he will be pretty eaſy with you, though you condemn many Things in him. For he has gained his main Point. And he knows that this once gained, all the reſt muſt follow by natural Conſequence, whether you will or no. But if you hold him faſt here, and be for Proof, he will only give you railing Accuſation. For he has no rational Foundation at all, for his Faith to ſtand on, and therefore denies its being diſputed. You muſt believe as he ſays and that is enough: For he is always a <hi>Papiſt</hi> in this Point as well as many others.</p>
            <p>And therefore an <hi>Enthuſiaſt</hi> will have nothing to do with <hi>Reaſon</hi> in Matters of <hi>Faith,</hi> for Fear it ſhould deceive him. And therefore can have no good Foundation for his Faith to ſtand on.</p>
            <p>And thus they thruſt themſelves into the bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Labyrinth of Deceit and Deluſion, for Fear of being deceived by their old, moſt kind, intimate,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:005167_0023_1016CC4BABABCB58"/>and tender Friend <hi>Reaſon;</hi> which offers its kind Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to prevent their being deceived; but they refuſe it. And indeed without it they cannot take one Step right, nor one Moment keep from being deluded and deceived.</p>
            <p>Thus did our firſt Mother <hi>Eve,</hi> who firſt of all took in the Poiſon of <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> which has infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all her Seed ever ſince. She neglected to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult <hi>Reaſon</hi> about the <hi>Revelation</hi> brought her by the <hi>Serpent.</hi> For had ſhe called in <hi>Reaſon</hi> to take Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel withal, this might have prevented her being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; and thus her Progeny are prone to do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſince. Had ſhe ſaid to the <hi>Serpent,</hi> Who ſent you upon this Diſcovery? What <hi>authentick Seal,</hi> have you of Commiſſion? How do I know you have any Commiſſion from God, to make this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, I have God's plain Word for it, that I may not eat of this Fruit; and muſt I believe you upon your bare Word for it? Bring an authentic Seal of your Commiſſion from God, or I have no Reaſon to regard you. I rely upon God forbidding me, and I dare not meddle with it, until I am ſure I have the ſame Word to give me Liberty; and then I know I may eat of it, as freely as any other Fruit of the Garden; but 'till then I muſt and will forbear.</p>
            <p>Had ſhe thus ſummoned her Reaſon to take Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel within this Matter of Faith, it might have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented her Ruin; but here ſhe failed. She belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Serpent without asking Counſel of her Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And by this Means ſhe infected her ſelf, and all her Poſterity, with the ſame <hi>enthuſiaſtick</hi> Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, to any Thing that pretends to be <hi>divine;</hi> and to make them Partakers of that which is called <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> and <hi>divine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though it be the proper Province of <hi>Faith,</hi> to receive divine Revelation of ſpiritual and divine Things; yet it is the proper Province of <hi>Reaſon,</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:005167_0024_1016CC4EDCF734F8"/>and in which Faith has nothing to do, to <hi>determine whether the Revelation be from God.</hi> For until this be firſt known and determined by the <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Underſtanding, Faith</hi> has nothing at all to do, nor can it begin upon any Foundation that will ſtand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is impoſſible without this to have any good Foundation. For if the Revelation or Diſcovery be not divine, there can be no Reaſon to receive, and acquieſce in it as ſuch. Therefore this muſt firſt of all be determined by the Underſtanding and Reaſon: And then Faith's Province begins and not before. For if it might being before, it might receive a Lie for Truth; for an heavenly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation, as our firſt Mother <hi>Eve</hi> did, to the undoing herſelf and all her Poſterity.</p>
            <p>I would gladly know of any Man, How it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to know that any Diſcovery, or Revelation is from God, without the <hi>Evidence</hi> and <hi>Determination</hi> of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Underſtanding;</hi> I muſt confeſs I cannot ſee how it is any Ways poſſible for us to know it, to ſay that it may be ſo, without ſhewing how, can ſatisfy none but a deluded Enthuſiaſt.</p>
            <p>I can conceive how Fancy can imagine it to be divine, and be powerfully heated and moved by it, but this is very far from knowing it; though it is uſually a Thouſand Times more ſudden, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and more ſuddenly produces viſible Effects, as it did in our firſt Mother <hi>Eve.</hi> But when all is done, this does not prove it to be divine. For if <hi>Reaſon</hi> does not add its Teſtimony, that it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine it can be no more than a deluded Imagination.</p>
            <p>This therefore is the Effect of this enthuſiaſtick Fire, that the Mind aſſents to, or believes, its own warm Imaginations, for heavenly and divine Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, and takes no Proofs of it, from the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and Dictates of Reaſon: And therefore this lays the Foundation, for the worſt of Errors and
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:005167_0025_1016CC519280FFE0"/>Deluſions. For upon this Foundation nothing can be kept out, from being received for an heavenly and divine Diſcovery. For I cannot ſee how it is poſſible to prevent it in ſuch Caſe, but only by the immediate Interpoſition of God himſelf, to reſtore ſuch Perſons to the right Uſe of their Reaſon, and Underſtanding again, though they have deſpiſed, and abuſed it. Though God may very juſtly in Judgment, leave ſuch Perſons to themſelves, and the Power of <hi>Satan</hi>'s Impreſſions, and Impulſes, who have a Fondneſs to follow, and fall in with ſuch Things, and no Queſtion he often does ſo, when he permits <hi>Satan</hi> to advance <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> among a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to try their Stedfaſtneſs in the Faith and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Thus I have ſhewed that Enthuſiaſm makes Men believe without a good Foundation, and their Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and Conduct is proportionable to their Faith.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>genuine Effect</hi> of <hi>Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm,</hi> is a <hi>blind following of whatever Impreſſion</hi> or <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe is made upon their Fancy,</hi> or <hi>Imagination,</hi> under the Notion of being <hi>ſpiritual.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Impulſe</hi> or <hi>Impreſſion</hi> made there, always ſeems to ſuch Perſons, to be ſome heavenly and divine Diſcovery: Some Communication from, and Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of the <hi>Holy Spirit.</hi> Something that lets them into the Secrets of Heaven; and diſcovers to them either Truth or Duty.</p>
            <p>And this is ſo ſtrong, quick and powerful in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that it hurries them on with Violence accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it; and they verily think 'tis all heavenly and divine; and therefore without making any Doubt, Scruple or Enquiry further into the Matter, by conſulting their Reaſon and the Oracles of God, they blindly follow wherever this leads them. For to ſend ſuch to the Oracles of God to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:005167_0026_1016CC53F1E61028"/>they are right, they think as abſurd, as to ſend a Man to the Sun at bright Noon-Day to know whether it be the Sun that he ſees; for they think 'tis what is contained in the Oracles of God that they ſee, and from this Fountain proceeds thoſe ſtrange and unaccountable Things, which are often to be ſeen among Enthuſiaſts; which do ſo often confound the Thoughts, even of wiſe Men about them. For ſometimes the Impreſſions ſeems vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently to carry them to that which is good, and a fair Face of Religion, at other Times ſo confuſed, and ſo contrary to it, that even wiſe Men know not what to make of them: and are greatly ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled about them; but it all proceeds from this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> that is in them, according to the <hi>working of Satan,</hi> by ſuch <hi>Signs and lying Wonders</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> has it. 2 Theſſ. 2.9, 10. For the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> has always come in, and gained his Power over a People, by <hi>ſuch Signs</hi> and <hi>lying Wonders,</hi> as are produced by the <hi>powerful Impulſes of Enthuſiaſm;</hi> and therefore when a People ſee Multitudes of <hi>ſuch Signs</hi> and <hi>lying Wonders</hi> among them they may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that the <hi>Man of Sin is but juſt behind them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>ſame Spirit</hi> that introduced <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> into our firſt Mother <hi>Eve</hi> in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> moves, and actuates them, and fills them with ſuch powerful <hi>Impulſes,</hi> many Times to Things in themſelves good and carrying a Face, as though they were for the Advancement of Religion, and the Salvation of Souls, as he did when he deluded <hi>Eve:</hi> But all this is done the better to hide the Poiſon: For the <hi>great Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm</hi> of the <hi>Man of Sin</hi> was and is brought in and propagated by this Means, and therefore 'tis called the <hi>Myſtery of Iniquity,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2.7. If Satan worketh his Wonders in an open bare faced Manner, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed openly it was to bring them to worſhip the Devil, it would be no Myſtery at all. But his
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:005167_0027_1016CC56617552A8"/>Signs muſt be <hi>lying, deceitful Wonders,</hi> and with the <hi>greateſt Pretence for the Glory and Honour of God, and Good of Souls,</hi> or his working would be no My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery at all. And therefore the Followers of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> or <hi>Man of Sin</hi> are called <hi>Myſtery, Babylon:</hi> Rev. 17.5—And they can by no Means keep up the <hi>Myſtery of their Iniquity,</hi> but by Means of the <hi>powerful working of Satan,</hi> by the <hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>lying Wonders of Enthuſiaſm,</hi> produced by his ſtrong <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,</hi> or <hi>Impulſes</hi> made upon enthuſiaſtic Perſons.</p>
            <p>Enthuſiaſm is ſuch a <hi>Proteus,</hi> that Satan can put it into all Manner of Shapes, to ſerve his Deſign of deluding poor blind ignorant Mortals, and yet always make it appear with a moſt zealous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Face.</p>
            <p>And as long as Satan can hold the Souls of Men faſt, in believing ſuch Impulſes, and powerful Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions upon their Minds, to be heavenly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Diſcoveries, and keep them on acting accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, and puff them up with ſpiritual Pride and Self-Conceit, as partaking of ſpiritual and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Things above others, he cares not, for he keeps his <hi>Palace in Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what have been all the Signs, and lying Wonders, whereby Satan hath brought in, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> but ſuch <hi>enthuſiaſtick Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and <hi>Impulſes,</hi> and the <hi>Effects</hi> of them. By this Means be has, as it were, made <hi>Fire to come down from Heaven in the Sight</hi> or Apprehenſion <hi>of Men.</hi> Rev. 13.13. i. e, he has filled their <hi>Imaginations</hi> and <hi>Fancies</hi> with <hi>dreadful Apprehenſions of Fire coming down from God</hi> to conſume them, and by this has faſtened his Deluſions in their Souls. The whole Hiſtory of that Myſtery of Iniquity, gives us Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of no other Fire, coming down from Heaven to fright them into his Deluſions. And they look upon it truly miraculous, that he ſhould thus all on
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:005167_0028_1016CC58CC75CDD8"/>a ſudden Fright ſuch great Numbers of Perſons with ſuch dreadful Apprehenſions and conclude, therefore that it muſt be from God. And the <hi>ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> and <hi>powerful Light</hi> with which he <hi>impreſſes their Souls, preſently after,</hi> is looked upon no leſs miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous than the former, and therefore muſt (they think) proceed from God.</p>
            <p>And a Soul thus filled, and impreſſed verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves 'tis all ſpiritual and divine: And goes on believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and blindly following ſuch Impreſſions, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes without any Doubt, Scruple, or Enquiry. 'Tis but to feel ſuch Impreſſions, or ſweet Feelings (as they call them) and they follow it immediately.</p>
            <p>To make any Doubt, Scruple or Enquiry, in ſuch a plain Caſe they think would be a great Diſhonour to the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God; and a great Means to <hi>quench</hi> it. And they find by Experience that it does ſo; for ſuch a Spirit that makes the Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and that ſo ſtrongly influences them, cannot bear any Enquiries to be made into his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions leſt he ſhould be diſcovered. For the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scriptures, and true Reaſon are his mortal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies; and to ask Counſel of theſe two together quenches that Spirit, becauſe they are Counſellers ſent from Heaven, to diſcover the Blackneſs and Darkneſs of his Deſigns: And no Wonder then that ſuch a Spirit retires whenever theſe are called in to be conſulted with, rather than be diſcovered what he is.</p>
            <p>If it were the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> that made the Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he would never retire out of ſuch Company: For the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> always ſtrongly moves Men to call in ſuch Company, and to conſult them on all Occaſions, and never to ſtir one Step forward with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them. There are others indeed, though great Friends to Enthuſiaſm, and feel it pretty ſtrongly working in their Souls, yet arrive not to this Pitch;
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:005167_0029_1016CC5A74068AE0"/>and are ready to ſtart and be affrighted at any ſtrong Impulſe made upon their Minds: and fall immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to enquiring and examining all by Scripture and true Reaſon.</p>
            <p>Theſe therefore the Tempter muſt uſe gently, or they will prove his worſt Enemies in this Deſign. And therefore he is ſparing of making any ſuch ſtrong Impulſes, or Impreſſions there, with Violence. Theſe therefore he moves in a more gentle, ſoft and eaſy Manner. Theſe he perſwades to think, that there are only ſome few wild almoſt diſtracted Perſons that have ſuch ſtrong Impulſes. Yet ſuch Perſons are no leſs led away, by the Power of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm than the other, tho' in a ſafer and eaſier Way.</p>
            <p>But theſe <hi>Impulſes</hi> or <hi>violent ſtrong Impreſſions,</hi> made upon their Fancies or Imaginations; have ſo many <hi>wonderful Effects</hi> both upon the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Mind</hi> that it is almoſt incredible, eſpecially to ſuch as never ſaw or heard them, viz. ſuch as <hi>dreadful Frights extatick Joys, violent &amp; ſtrange Motions of the Body, and the Voice, fainting Fits, Convulſions,</hi> and the like.</p>
            <p>All which if you trace the Hiſtory of Enthuſiaſm from the Beginning of the World down to our Day, both among the <hi>Heathen,</hi> and the <hi>People of God,</hi> have in a greater or leſſer Degree, always attended En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm, and where any Thing of this Nature is to be ſeen among thoſe who are under the <hi>powerful Operation</hi> of the <hi>Spirit of God;</hi> they are all owing to a greater or leſſer Degree of <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> by which <hi>Satan</hi> would overthrow the good Effects of the <hi>Spirit's</hi> Operation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Another <hi>Effect</hi> of <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> is great and <hi>ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Joy</hi> without and <hi>good Foundation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Joys and Comforts attending Enthuſiaſm are for the moſt Part if not always ſudden, and violent at their firſt Appearance; and for the moſt Part ſo
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:005167_0030_1016CC5C2475B998"/>by Fits afterwards. Whereas that which ariſes from the Influence of the Spirit of God, is uſually more gradual; intermixed for the moſt Part with holy Fear, and Jealouſy over themſelves, and always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds upon Foundations of Reaſon and Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and never without the moſt bright and clear Exerciſe of Reaſon, Underſtanding and Judgment.</p>
            <p>But the Joys and Comforts attending Enthuſiaſm are ſudden, great, and violent, even ſo as many Times to <hi>overpower the Body</hi> in a great Degree, and in a Manner wholly to deſtroy the <hi>Exerciſe of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> And therefore an Enthuſiaſt can ſeldom give a better Account of it, than that they <hi>ſee</hi> and <hi>feel</hi> great Light and Comfort in their Souls, which raviſhes them with Joy. They ſee ſuch ſpiritual and heavenly Sights, that they <hi>feel</hi> the moſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Joy ſpreading along their Souls; and they think they are ſure all this is from the <hi>Spirit of God.</hi> They can't give a <hi>rational</hi> Account what this Light was, nor how it came into their Minds, nor upon what <hi>rational</hi> Foundation it ſtands. But only can ſay they had great Light let into their Souls; they <hi>ſaw God and Chriſt,</hi> and this has filled them with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible Joy.</p>
            <p>They can't diſtinguiſh this Light from imaginary ſeeing and feeling.</p>
            <p>They can't trace the Beginnings of it from a <hi>rational</hi> free Act of their Souls accepting, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing <hi>Chriſt</hi> according to the Offers made in the Goſpel: But it all begins upon this great Light im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed upon their Imaginations, and therefore has no good Foundation to ſtand upon. For ask them what this Light was, and they can't tell you in any rational Manner.</p>
            <p>For what true Light in the Soul is, they are utter Strangers to. For this can be no more than the clear Evidence of the Truth and Goodneſs of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:005167_0031_1016CC5F569864B0"/>as a Revelation from God. A clear Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Conviction of this from ſolid Reaſons, is true Light in the Soul; and when the Spirit of God gives this it fully perſwades the Soul to accept the Offers made therein, and to live and act accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereunto. And thus they become true and real Chriſtians and evangelically conformed to the bleſſed Jeſus. And a ſolid rational Joy, Comfort, and Satisfaction is by the Spirit of God raiſed in the Soul hereupon.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Another genuine <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Effect</hi> of <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> is a <hi>great Contempt of all but themſelves</hi> or thoſe that are <hi>like them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They value not high nor low rich nor poor, or any Perſon whatever, but ſuch as entertain, or are favourable to their Enthuſiaſm.</p>
            <p>This, and this alone can make them think well of any Perſon. As to all others, though never ſo wiſe, and good, and though they have given the brighteſt Evidence of their true Piety, by an holy, wiſe heavenly and unblemiſhed Converſation; yet all this paſſes for nothing at all with an Enthuſiaſt.</p>
            <p>He rather deems this a Sign of their <hi>Hypocriſy,</hi> than of their true Piety, if they give not into his Enthuſiaſm. He can readily and freely paſs Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Condemnation upon all ſuch, and ſend them to Hell: And as freely ſentence ſuch to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as live in Drunkenneſs, Whoredom, Lying, Cheating, Deceiving, Envy, Contention and Striſe, if they are but warm Enthuſiaſts.</p>
            <p>They can hardly be neighbourly or peaceable, with any that are not Enthuſiaſts like themſelves, or ſuch as ſavour it.</p>
            <p>This with them is the only Mark, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Character of a true Child of God. If they ſee any with this Mark, which they diſcover by their Looks, and Words (for the moſt Part) they
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:005167_0032_1016CC626E448738"/>at once pronounce ſuch an one a true Child of God, and Heir of Heaven; without knowing any Thing more about them; yea thought ſuch have a thouſand plain Marks of Satan's Image upon them. And they are as ſevere in their Reflections upon all others that have not this Mark, as they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> kind to ſuch as have. For they at once ſend them to Hell, though they have never ſo many true Scripture Marks of the Children of God; if they diſlike their Enthuſiaſm.</p>
            <p>They deſpiſe them; and can bear no Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings from them to convince them of their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and Miſtakes. They look upon themſelves to have engroſſed all that's ſpiritual and divine, and that all others that have never ſeen this great ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Light, nor felt the Heat of this ſtrong ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Fire; are all Reprobates, and Oppoſers of God's Work, and deſerve no better Sentence than Damnation. And therefore ſhow a ſupercilious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of them.</p>
            <p>This indeed is not the Caſe of all of them, for ſome are much more moderate, and reaſonable than others are. But yet this is the true Temper of the Spirit of Enthuſiaſm; tho' it appears moſt when blown up into a great Flame. But I ſhall mention but one more.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And that is a <hi>fiery Spirit of Perſecution, againſt all that differ from them,</hi> as far as they have Power.</p>
            <p>Indeed when Enthuſiaſm firſt begins to ſhow it ſelf; it pretends to all <hi>Meekneſs, Patience, Quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They would not do any Thing for all the World, to hurt another for his Opinion and Judgment. If he be wrong they would do not more than pity, inſtruct, and pray for him. And thus Enthuſiaſm would be thought, to be the true Goſpel Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:005167_0033_1016CC650CAF6020"/>
But as ſoon as great Numbers are added, it ſoon puts on another Face; eſpecially, when there is Hopes of their being the ſtrongeſt Party. Then they begin to tranſgreſs <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Regularity</hi> in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> and pretend <hi>Conſcience</hi> for ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And that nothing is <hi>Order</hi> but their <hi>own Francies</hi> and <hi>Imaginations.</hi> They begin then to be <hi>loud</hi> and <hi>boiſterous,</hi> and <hi>threaten</hi> what they will do; and begin <hi>boldly to trample upon Authority,</hi> in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> and are not afraid to <hi>ſpeak evil of Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> Jude 8. And if any the leaſt Reſtraint be put, or attempted to be put upon them; they <hi>cry and bawl out Perſecution, as loud as they can roar,</hi> and all becauſe they may not run to the <hi>wildeſt Exceſs.</hi> But if Matters go on ſtill, ſo as that they gain the Aſcendant and have the Power; they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſhew the moſt <hi>dreadful hot fiery Spirit of Perſecution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All muſt buckle to their <hi>Dagon Imaginations,</hi> or they muſt be dealt with the moſt ſeverely. Then the greateſt Hardſhips ſhall be impoſed, and called Moderation, whereas a Thouſands Times leſs laid upon them before, would have made them roar out Perſecution, ſo loud that the World almoſt might have heard them.</p>
            <p>It ever has been ſo with Enthuſiaſm: Witneſs the Enthuſiaſm of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> among the <hi>ten Tribes;</hi> and the Enthuſiaſm of <hi>Mahomet</hi> in <hi>Turkey;</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all that of the <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> which has prevailed about a Thouſand Years. What a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hot <hi>perſecuting Spirit</hi> does it ſhow towards all that differ from it; wherever it can gain the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, i. e. upon all ſuch as they call Oppoſers.</p>
            <p>This Spirit ever did and ever will attend Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm, wherever it gains the Power over others. For nothing better can be expected from that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:005167_0034_1016CC66EBE57510"/>which judges and paſſes Sentence upon Men, and ſends them to Hell, that deſpiſes Reaſon, and ſets up Faith without it. Nothing better can be expected from that Spirit that ſhews <hi>ſo much En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> to all others that differ from them. As to call them <hi>Dogs, Devils</hi> and <hi>ſentences them to Hell:</hi> Such want nothing but Power, and they would execute their Sentence ſpeedily to the full. This is moſt certainly the true Spirit of Enthuſiaſm, tho' Multitudes are ready to follow it with Eagerneſs.</p>
            <p>Thus I have endeavoured to trace <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> from its <hi>Origin</hi> to the <hi>End</hi> of it as to this World. And from what has been ſaid concerning it, we may ſee that the Nature of it is, to make Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons compaſs themſelves about with <hi>Sparks of their own kindling,</hi> and to <hi>walk in the Light of his own Fire,</hi> as the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſpeaks, Iſai. 50.11. Whoſe Words ſhew that Enthuſiaſm prevailed in his Day. When a People grow corrupt in their Practiſes, they ſoon come to that Paſs, as not to be willing to bear <hi>ſound Doctrine;</hi> and then by the juſt Judgment of God upon them, they are ready to be filled with Enthuſiaſm, and then <hi>heap to themſelves Teachers having itching Ears.</hi> 2 Tim. 4.3. And then they do at leaſt vertually <hi>ſay to the Prophets, propheſy to us ſmooth Things,</hi> Iſai. 30.10. They love ſuch Teachers, as bring them ſuch Doctrines, as ſuddenly paſs them for godly Men, and ſlatter, and ſooth their Pride and Self-Conceit, and thereby <hi>ſew Pillows under their Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Holes, and daub them with untempered Mortar.</hi> Jer. 5.31. Micah 2.11. Ezek. 13.18, &amp;c. And there is nothing ſo effectual as Enthuſiaſm to do this, and therefore nothing that a corrupt People are ſo ſoon carried away with as this, becauſe it always pretends to the moſt quick, and eaſy Way to make ſure of Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:005167_0035_1016CC6A1CA6FDD0"/>
And although it fills the Soul with <hi>great Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> as our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſpeaks of it, Matth. 6.23. Yet how great a Degree of it may conſiſt with <hi>true Faith</hi> in Chriſt, and true Humility of Mind, and true Love to God, is not very eaſy to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine. But this I am fully perſwaded of, that as 'tis acknowledged by all but hot Enthuſiaſts that there remains ſtill ſome of the <hi>Old-Man</hi> in the beſt of Saints, i. e. ſome ſinful corrupt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and Deſires while in this Life; ſo am I ſatisfied that godly Men, (ſome more than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) are many Times filled with conſiderable Degrees of <hi>Enthuſiaſm:</hi> And for a Man to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine preciſely, what Degree of it is inconſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with true Piety, I think is very difficult; and how far the kind Author of our Beings, who knows our Darkneſs, Infirmities, and Miſtakes, may pardon and overlook them, in and through Chriſt, where he ſees an honeſt, ſincere, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Heart, I think is too much Boldneſs to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.</p>
            <p>Yet am I not in the leaſt the better pleaſed with it becauſe of this, but look upon it, as the Remainders of <hi>Original Sin</hi> in the Godly. And therefore look upon my ſelf bound to pity and pray for ſuch as are overtaken with it, and with the ſame Spirit of Meekneſs, and Chriſtian Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs to reſtore ſuch, as I am thoſe that are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in any other Sin.</p>
