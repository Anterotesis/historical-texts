            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Diſcourſe, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>AGREEABLY to the recommendation of the great Council of our United States, ſeconded by that of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, and Repreſentatives of this Commonwealth, we are convened, this day, publicly <hi>to teſtify our grief "for the death of</hi> GENERAL GEORGE WASHINGTON," with decent formalities of mourning ſuitable to the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful occaſion, and expreſſive of the honor and reſpect, due to the memory of ſo illuſtrious and worthy a perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and of thoſe ſentiments, with which the mind of all ranks and orders of men among us, ſeems to be ſo deeply and extraordinarily affected.</p>
            <p>As it has been requeſted that a diſcourſe ſuitable to the occaſion be publicly delivered, the words of king David, ſpoken on an occaſion ſomewhat ſimilar, occurred to mind as no improper motto. "KNOW YE NOT THAT THERE IS A PRINCE AND A GREAT MAN THIS DAY FALLEN IN ISRAEL?" 2 SAMUEL III. 38.</p>
            <p>They were occaſioned by the lamented death of Abner, the chief captain of the hoſt of Iſrael; and, I think, they may be adopted by us at this time with great propriety. A great man indeed has fallen: yea, may we not ſay in ſober truth that a greater, than Abner, is this day fallen in our nation: An important pillar in our political build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:037605_0004_100EE8D29DBBADD8"/>
has given way, and ſunk to the ground; and United America has very ſenſibly felt the ſhock through its whole extent and trembles at the fall. Since the ſun has ſhone on theſe regions, a death ſo lamented has never been known among us.</p>
            <p>Had the counſels and decrees of Heaven concurred with our wiſhes, this day had been celebrated, as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as a day of rejoicing, and grateful commemoration of the day, which, ſixty-eight years ago, gave birth to one, whom God raiſed up to be a diſtinguiſhed honor and bleſſing to his country, and a great example to the world of thoſe virtues and other ſhining accompliſhments, which give dignity to human nature. But the ſovereign Diſpoſer of all events has turned it into a day of mourning. THIS GREAT MAN IS FALLEN. Having ſerved his generation by the will of God, he is gone the way of all the earth, and ſleeps in the tomb, never to wake and riſe again till the heavens are no more. And we join ſincerely with our fellow citizens in expreſſing our ſorrowful reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the great loſs the nation and the world have ſuſtained, of the frown of heaven upon us, and alſo the great reſpect and veneration we have for one, whoſe extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary talents, virtues, and achievments had been ſo long, ſo honorably, and ſucceſsfully diſplayed in the ſervice of his country in its higheſt offices and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments. We take up the lamentation of the mourning prophet, <q>The joy of our heart is ceaſed; our dance is turned into mourning; the crown is fallen from our head; wo unto us that we have ſinned.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:037605_0005_100EE8D4782A99E0"/>But let us mourn like chriſtians, with humble, patient, unrepining ſubmiſſion to God; who, though ſurrounded with clouds and darkneſs, governs the world with perfect wiſdom, righteouſneſs, and goodneſs. He gives, and he takes away, bleſſed be his name; yet ſentiments of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion forbid us not to have, and decently expreſs the feelings of humanity. This we would now do, not in the wild effuſions of paſſion, but by modeſt, ſober, unaffected tokens, and language of deep and ſerious concern.</p>
            <p>Without entering upon a detail of thoſe accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are requiſite to form the character of a GREAT MAN, perhaps no man of the age, certainly no one in theſe parts of the world has a more univerſally acknowledged right to a high rank among the moſt illuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious characters in the world, than he, whoſe death we are now called to lament; whoſe great abilities and virtues, were diſplayed in a ſeries of heroic acts and achievements, which will doubtleſs immortalize his name. The pen of the hiſtorian, will we truſt, do juſtice to his character, which has alſo been emblazoned in the many ſplendid and eloquent panegyrics, which have been pronounced, throughout the United States, in honor to his memory. If it be expected that ſomething be now ſaid on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; yet, I know you do not expect that it will be done with that beauty and energy of thought and language, which others have exhibited. You know the Speaker has not talents for this, nor does his ambition prompt him to ſo vain an attempt. But the honor he has for the name of the illuſtrious WASHINGTON conſtrains him to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037605_0006_100EE8D60814C190"/>
and call him bleſſed. A heart impreſſed with deep concern does not much regard ornaments. A mourning habit needs not ſplendid embelliſhments; nor need a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral diſcourſe affect to ſhine in a fine dreſs.</p>
            <p>External diſtinctions, indeed, of which many make much account, are but the trappings of greatneſs. The true dignity of man is to be eſtimated from the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the mind and virtues of the heart, exerted for great, noble, and uſeful purpoſes. Our WASHINGTON, however, poſſeſſed in a high degree thoſe advantages, which outward diſtinction gives a man, in the eye of the world.</p>
            <p>The family from which he deſcended was honorable<note n="*" place="bottom">He was born in Weſtmoreland County in Virginia, in a pariſh, which beat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the name of his family.</note>; but in no external reſpect was it more honorable than in having ſo illuſtrious a branch ſpring from it. Beſides poſſeſſing an affluent fortune, his perſonal accompliſhments were extraordinary. In his countenance, which ſome think is no ſmall index of the mind, majeſty and comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs were, I am informed, admirably blended. It was very commanding, and engaging. Penetrating ſagacity, conſcious integrity, and goodneſs were there ſo lively expreſſed, that it ſeemed a mirror of thoſe qualities, which ſtrike the beholder with reverence and love.</p>
            <p>But the accompliſhments, which are ſeated in the mind and the inner man of the heart, and in which he had few equals, were an early preſage of future greatneſs. So conſpicuous were his talents for great public ſervices, that, when he was little more than twenty years old, he was, though ſo young, employed to conduct an important
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037605_0007_100EE8D7A2BAB388"/>
negotiation, and diſcharged his truſt with judgment and fidelity. At this early period he began to gather the lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of military glory in the defence of his country. Holding a Major's commiſſion in the army, he gained an advantage over a ſuperior enemy; and afterward, when a colonel under the unfortunate Braddock, who not heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening to his advice, fell, and his army was defeated on the banks of Monongahela, our WASHINGTON was honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the inſtrument, under <hi>God,</hi> of bringing off the ſhatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed remains of that army; and it may not be unworthy of notice, that, in a public addreſs delivered about this time, he was ſpoken of, as one, who ſeemed deſigned in provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to be a Savior of his country; words, which have been verified in a more remarkable manner, than was probably thought of, at the time they were ſpoken.</p>
            <p>When he had no longer occaſion to employ his military talents in the ſervice of his country, he was a magiſtrate of the county, a Judge of the Court, and a Member of the Legiſlative Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>But it was upon occaſion of the diſputes between Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and its American colonies and the war, which was in conſequence of them, that his ſuperior talents and heroic virtues were drawn forth and preſented to view in their full luſtre. Then he entered on a new and ſhining ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer of military glory. Having been choſen a delegate to the Congreſs, which the breaking out of the war had called together, he was unanimouſly choſen chief commander of the American Army; and took a commiſſion for the execution of this moſt arduous and hazardous office, at the call of his country; and, in defence of its invaded rights and privileges, ſhrunk not from ſtanding foremoſt
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037605_0008_100EE8D9D13F67C0"/>
in the poſt of danger and expoſing his life and its deareſt intereſts in the perilous conteſt. In the diſcharge of this high truſt for eight years, in which the difficulties, dangers, and hardſhips he endured were inconceivable by thoſe, who did not experience them, he diſplayed the abil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities, wiſdom, unbroken fortitude, firm reſolution, incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible fidelity, and integrity of a great and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Captain. Nor was his clemency and humanity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards enemies, when the fortune of war had put them in his power, leſs conſpicuous than his courage and conduct in repelling their hoſtilities. Such was alſo his kindneſs and tenderneſs towards thoſe, whom he commanded, that he was revered and loved by them as a father. Though he was, it is ſaid, one of great ſenſibility, as moſt great men are, yet he had ſuch uncommon government of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that the very trying and provoking ſcenes, with which he was often exerciſed, very ſeldom occaſioned any viſible diſcompoſure of ſpirits. An achievement truly heroic. "He that ruleth his ſpirit is better than the mighty who taketh a city." And when by means of his valour and conduct, with that of the other brave officers, and ſoldiers under him, the war was, by the bleſſing of God, brought to a happy and triumphant cloſe, and peace, liberty, and independence ſecured to United America, then, with a magnanimity and generoſity ſcarce to be paralleled, he gave up his commiſſion to the Congreſs, and fell into the rank again with private citizens, reſolutely refuſing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any compenſation for the toils and dangers of eight years ſpent in the ſervice of his country, except what ſhould accrue to him from the applauſes of his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037605_0009_100EE8DBA0B52370"/>
from ſeeing his fellow citizens enjoy the fruits of his toils and travail, exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſſing their high grateful ſenſe of his ſervices, and from the hope "that God would think on him for good according to all that he had done for his people." We may ſay, as Mr. Jefferſon ſaid ſeveral years ago, <q>in war we have produced a WASHINGTON, whoſe memory will be adored, while liberty ſhall have votaries; whoſe name will triumph over time, and will in future ages aſſume its juſt rank among the moſt cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated worthies of the world.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But it was not long before he was again called forth, from the ſhades of his retirement, for further ſervices of the higheſt importance. The independency of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican States being gained and recogniſed, it was ſoon found neceſſary that a more ſtrong and energetic form of government be eſtabliſhed, which ſhould embrace, and be a firm band of union to the whole ſyſtem of American States. To form this a convention was appointed, to be compoſed of men of approved wiſdom and virtue, delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the ſeveral parts of the union. To this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, WASHINGTON was delegated; and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly choſen Preſident of that venerable council of ſages, by whom our excellent federal conſtitution was framed, which has been highly approved by the moſt eminent civilians, and of which we have experienced the happy ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects equal to our moſt ſanguine hopes.</p>
            <p>When this conſtitution, in the framing of which he had borne ſo diſtinguiſhed a part, having been accepted by the people, came to be organized; by the unanimous votes
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037605_0010_100EE8DD2A9FE168"/>
of the electors he was once, and again choſen to the higheſt place of honor and authority; and aſcended to it with the univerſal acclamations of all ranks and orders of the people. And his adminiſtration realized the exalted hopes and expectations, which his abilities and virtues had raiſed. And the Preſident appeared in the cabinet with the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of a great and accompliſhed ſtateſman, not inferior to the general in his military line.</p>
            <p>After ſixteen years had been devoted to the ſervice of his country, under the heavy burdens with which its higheſt and moſt arduous offices were loaded, he reſigned the reins of civil government, as he had before reſigned his military commiſſion. It would have been agreeable to the general wiſh of the people, if they could have longer enjoyed the advantages of his wiſe and faithful adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and he would doubtleſs have had another unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous election, had not his advanced age craved repoſe from the cares and toils of office, ſo ſtrongly, that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed himſelf from ſtanding candidate for it.</p>
            <p>But when his country's wrongs and grievances, of which no redreſs could be obtained by peaceable negociation, called to arms, and he perceived that the public eye was looking up to him for his help, he immediately complied with the unexpected call, and took upon him the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the army to be raiſed for the defence of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And had his life been prolonged, in the preſent critical ſituation of affairs, we ſhould have hoped for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant advantages from his wiſdom and influence.— But theſe hopes have now vaniſhed with his expiring

breath. WASHINGTON, whoſe life, from his early youth to hoary age, has been ſo diſtinguiſhed in the ſervice of his country, as to gain him the title of the SAVIOUR AND FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY, is taken from us, and that at a time when his ſervices ſeem to be peculiarly wanted. His breath is gone forth, and, in that very day, his thoughts and cares for us are all periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Before we finiſh this ſketch, it muſt not be omitted that he was a ſerious profeſſor of the chriſtian religion,<note n="*" place="bottom">It is ſaid that while he commanded the army it was his daily practice, like Col. Gardiner, to devote an hour to private religious exerciſes.</note> and held in utter abhorrence the principles of that vile, atheiſtical, Epicurian Philoſophy, which has corrupted the minds and morals of ſo many, and produced incalculable miſchief in the world.</p>
            <p>You are ſenſible that what has been ſaid concerning this great man, whoſe fall occaſions a general mourning, cannot be from a perſonal knowledge, but from ſuch credible information as one in theſe diſtant parts, and ſo low a ſtation, has had acceſs to; I think nothing has been ſaid but what is conſiſtent with truth. And more might have been ſaid, with equal juſtice, reſpecting his moſt amiable and exemplary deportment, in the private walks of life; ſuch was the man to the honor of whoſe mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory the ſolemnities of this day are obſerved.</p>
            <p>Theſe honors we are all ſenſible can add nothing to him. And the chief view, we are to have in commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating theſe things, is (beſides expreſſing due reſpect to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037605_0012_100EE8E186BA9478"/>
the memory of one, who has ſerved his generation with ſo much fidelity and ſucceſs) to give God the glory that is due to his name, who raiſed up and formed this his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to be a fit inſtrument, in his hand, to accompliſh the great things, which he has done for us. Far be it from us to give that honor to any creature, however dignified, which is due to God alone, of whom, through whom, and to whom are all things.</p>
            <p>Are we not loudly called, this day, to humble ourſelves under his hand, who has ſo ſorely ſmitten and wounded us, and made ſo great a breach upon us? When a great man falls, of whom it may be ſaid, as was ſaid to David, "Thou art better than ten thouſands of us," whoſe great wiſdom and influence, were likely to guide, unite, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imate a people in purſuing thoſe meaſures, which would promote their true intereſt more, than could be expected from myriads of ordinary men, the quenching of ſuch a light ought to be conſidered as an alarming frown of Prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence. It darkens our day; and all who are wiſe to diſcern the ſigns of the times ſhould lay it to heart with ſuitable concern. <q>The Lord hath taken away the mighty man, the man of war, the judge, the prudent man, the antient, the captain of thouſands, the honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able man, the counſellor, and the eloquent orator. Help Lord for the faithful fail.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Should we not then humbly enquire wherefore our God is contending with us; our ſins doubtleſs are the procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cauſe of our calamities; ſhall there be evil in the city and the Lord hath not done it? And is it not our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037605_0013_100EE8E31116BD98"/>
which cauſe him to hide his face from us? Among numberleſs other provocations of divine diſpleaſure, which are too viſible among us, have we not abuſed our proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, as an encouragement to a preſumptuous ſecurity, and inſenſibility of our dependence on God? We then need not wonder if he frown upon us. When the Pſalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt ſaid, in his proſperity, that he ſhould never be moved, but that his mountain ſtood ſtrong, it immediately follows, "Thou didſt hide thy face, and I was troubled." Again have we not been too ready to truſt in man and make fleſh our arm? and when our undertakings have had ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, have we not ſacrificed to our net, and burnt incenſe to our own drag, giving that honour to the inſtruments, which is due only to the ſupreme agent? We do well to honor thoſe, on whom God puts diſtinguiſhing honor, endowing them with ſuperior gifts and virtues, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them guardian angels of a nation; as ſuch, we honor the memory of that GREAT MAN, whoſe fall we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But God forbid that we ſhould make an idol of any creature, our God is a jealous God. If we give his glory to another, we provoke his jealouſy to take away our idol, and ſhew us that thoſe, whom we adore as Gods, muſt die like men. <q>All fleſh is as graſs and all glory of man as the fading flower of the field. Let not the wiſe man glory in his wiſdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. Surely man in his beſt eſtate is altogether vanity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Of this we have lately had awakening and repeated admonitions. We had ſcarce put off our mourning for our excellent governor,<note n="*" place="bottom">His Excellency Increaſe Sumner Eſq<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

our grief; and we have the more reaſon to be alarmed, at theſe ſad viſitations, when ſuch men are taken away at ſuch a time as this, when our proſpects are darkened by thoſe clouds, which with portentous aſpect have been gathering ove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> us; and the ſetting of ſuch luminaries muſt increaſe the darkneſs. God grant that it be not a preſage of further calamities.</p>
            <p>How are all the glories of this world eclipſed by the mortality of the greateſt men! In what a ſtriking light muſt their folly appear who ſet their affections and found their hopes on things, which are ſo ſoon to fade and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fail! And what contempt has God poured upon the grandeur and glitter of wordly honor and riches, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by ſoon ſtripping the poſſeſſors of all this falſe glory, but alſo by often beſtowing it on the baſeſt of men, and ſo as it were expoſing it to open ſhame. But though the wicked are ſometimes exalted to the ſummit of earthly greatneſs, their triumphing is ſhort. Their end is faſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching. Death will ſoon lay all their glory in the duſt; and how great will be their fall! The wicked are driven away in their wickedneſs, and their name ſhall rot. But the righteous hath hope in his death; his end is peace; his memory is bleſſed; He ſhall be had in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting remembrance.</p>
            <p>Such was his end, for whoſe death a nation mourns, and whoſe name is honored as the friend of man, the patron and defender of the liberties and rights of his country. He received the ſudden ſummons with a mind raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove fear. "I am not afraid to die," ſaid he, with his
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037605_0015_100EE8E714D96ED0"/>
expiring breath, and then cloſing his eyes and mouth, with his own hands, cloſed a uſeful and glorious life with that ſerenity of mind, and compoſure of countenance, for which he had been ſo remarkable while paſſing through the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive and changing ſcenes of his life.</p>
            <q>
               <l>With growing dignity behold him riſe,</l>
               <l>Great while he lives, but greater when he dies.</l>
            </q>
            <p>The ſolemnities of this day, I have ſaid, can add nothing to the dead; but, by a wiſe improvement, they may be profitable to us; and our coming together in this houſe, which is become a houſe of mourning, may be better than to go to the houſe of feaſting. For this end we ſhould not only contemplate with due honor the characters of thoſe, who have ſhone with diſtinguiſhed luſtre, as public benefactors, but a noble emulation ſhould be enkindled within us to imitate their virtues. It was not merely poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing great talents that made GENERAL WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON ſo much greater than others, but it was his improving them ſo eminently for the good of mankind. Let us go and do likewiſe; though we expect not to riſe to the height of his greatneſs, yet let us endeavour in our narrower ſphere to ſerve God and our generation with dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igence and fidelity. To him, who improves well what he hath, more ſhall be given, and though his beginning were ſmall, his latter end may greatly increaſe.</p>
            <p>When we ſee that the life of the greateſt, the moſt honorable, and uſeful men is but a vapour, like that of others, which ſoon vaniſhes away, ſometimes when we moſt need the benefit of their talents, virtues, and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037605_0016_100EE8E8E1B9D9A0"/>
we are loudly admoniſhed not to put our truſt in any of the ſons of men. They who ſeem moſt worthy of our confidence may, we find, break like reeds when we lean upon them, and pierce our hearts with ſorrow and diſappointment. God is our only ſure refuge, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent help, in time of trouble. His name is a ſtrong tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to which we may fly and be ſafe. Under his protection we may hope to eſcape thoſe evils, of which we ſeem to have reaſon to be apprehenſive, in conſequence of the breaches he has made upon us. We ſhall not ſuffer ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck, if God takes our helm to ſteer us ſafe through the rocks of danger, though the under pilots of the ſtate ſhould be waſhed overboard and drowned in the moſt dangerous and tempeſtuous ſeaſon, the ſtormy wind is obedient to him, and will fulfil his word. Though WASHINGTON is dead, GOD lives and reigns, the king eternal and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal. Let the earth rejoice, clouds and darkneſs are round about him, but righteouſneſs and judgment are the habitation of his throne. Alleluia for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth; and if we ſeek him he will be found of us. He is with us while we are with him. This God will then be our God forever and ever. Happy is the people that is in ſuch a caſe, yea happy is the people whoſe God is the Lord.</p>
