            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Without the holy and exemplary lives of the votaries of religion, the goſpel of Chriſt uſually is ſo far from gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ground, that it daily loſes the room it has in the world, of which the preſent melancholy ſtate of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed churches is too plain a document. I am perſuaded, that next to the great out pouring of the <hi>Spirit grow on high,</hi> Iſa. xxxii. 15. the rapid and admirable ſucceſs of the glorious goſpel, was greatly owing to the holy lives of its profeſſors, eſpecially their ſhining in the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar and diſtinguiſhing duties of Chriſtianity, and their cheerful and undaunted boldneſs in ſuffering for Chriſt. Therefore, ſince in our day the-goſpel is ſo viſibly deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The want of connexion there is oft betwixt purpoſes diſcourſed by him, was occaſioned partly by the ſhort Humbers he ſome ſometimes fell in, his taking ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment, and other interruptions, and partly by reaſon of different diſcourſes perſons had to him.</p>

               <hi>2dly,</hi> This may enhance the value of this teſtimony, that he was under ſo great a damp, ſo dark a cloud, for three or four days before that abundant conſolation and joy the Lord ſilled him with, which you will find narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:030532_0013_0FE7C0CCE2FC4898"/>by himſelf in his dying words. How agreeable is this to the Lord's uſual way of dealing with his ſaints, he wounds and then heals, ſmites and then binds up, they are preſſed out of meaſure, above ſtrength, &amp;c. not only at converſion, but oft in his dealings with them through their life, both as to their outward and inward condition, and oft ſignally at death?

            <p n="3">

            <p n="5">

               <hi>6thly,</hi> And eſpecially that all this was ſpoke by him in view of approaching death, (for neither he nor others conceived the leaſt probability of his recovery after he took bed).

Yet even then what a calm on his ſoul? What a ſubmiſſion to it did he ſhew? What a boldneſs in facing this laſt enemy? With what concern and paſtion was he panting for death? How wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come was it to him? His own words will teſtify this. One of the oppoſite way, and not the meaneſt for ſenſe, ſaid, he never ſaw one ſo willing to die.

            <head>A SHORT ACCOUNT OF THE BIRTH, PARENTAGE, AND CHARACTER OF THE REVEREND <hi>Mr. THOMAS HALYBURTON,</hi> With ſome other circumſtances of his life.</head>
            <p>MR. THOMAS HALYBURTON, profeſſor of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the new college at St. Andrews, was born at Duplin, in the pariſh of Aberdalgy, December 25th, 1674, of worthy and godly parents, Mr. George Haly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burton and Margaret Playfere. His father was deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the family of Pitcur, in the county of Angus; and was miniſter of the pariſh of Aberdalgy, in the preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Perth, out of which he was ejected by the then government in the year 1662, as about three hundred more miniſters were alſo, ſummarily without any legal proceſs, ſimply for non-conformity to Prelacy.</p>
            <p>Mr. George Halyburton, who was then biſhop of Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keld, and had been an zealous covenanter, ſuddenly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo forward for the national defection, and ſo cruel a perſecutor of his once fellow preſbyters, that he would not ſpare him more than others, though he was his near kinſman, but turned him out of his charge: And yet that prelate was ſcarce well warm in his neſt, when the LORD ſmote himſelf with ſore ſickneſs, of which he died, and went to his place.</p>
            <p>Immediately after he was thus perſecuted, that choice and pious gentleman, the ſole heritor of the ſaid pariſh, who was one among a thouſand in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, beſide himſelf, was his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinary hearer, and while he lived, ſhewed no ſmall kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to him, which deferves a thankful remembrance from his relations.</p>
            <p>His father never repented his faithfulneſs in adhering to the covenanted work of reformation, but rejoiced that he had been honoured to suffer on that account; and when he fell aſleep in the Lord, in the year 1682, in the 55th year of his age, he died in the faith of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, that God would deliver this church from the then ſore perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it was under.</p>
            <p>His mother was daughter of Mr. Andrew Playfere, the firſt miniſter of Aberdalgy pariſh, after the reformation from popery, to whom her huſband ſucceeded a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reſtoration of prelacy. She was allied to ſome of the beſt families of the kingdom by the mother; of which here I ſhall forbear a particular account: But which was their far greater glory, both of them from their youth up were truly religions.</p>
            <p>His mother excelled many of her own ſex, for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the principles of religion, and an uncommon memory of the ſcriptures; ſhe would have exactly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated many of the choiceſt chapters of the Bible.</p>
            <p>They had a numerous family, no leſs than eleven chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and very ſickly; all of them died young, except their eldeſt daughter Jame<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and this their ſon Mr. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas; but to ſweeten theſe trials, they had peculiar com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the death of their children; ſome even of the youngeſt of them, gave ſingular evidences of their dying in the Lord, which ſome yet alive well mind.</p>
            <p>When his father died, he was happy to be under the care of ſuch a mother: The epiſcopal perſecution for non con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity daily growing, ſhe, with her ſon-in law and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, were forced for their ſafety to withdraw to Holland, and took him along with them while he was very young: He quickly learned the Dutch, and went to Eraſmus ſchool to learn the Latin. There they ſojourned till Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt 1687, as which time they returned home, narrowly eſcaping ſhipwreck.</p>
            <p>At their return he went to the ſchool, and afterwards to the univerſity, where he made great proficiency beyond

            <p>He was maſter of a conſiderable ſtock of prudence, he ſtudied to walk in wiſdom toward them that are without, and them that are within, and to become all things to all men.</p>
            <p>He was dextrous in obſerving tempers, and in addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and managing perſons. How wiſely he carried in church judicatories, whereof he was a member, others can witneſs.</p>
            <p>He abhorred that unedifying converſe, that is ſpent in frequent and unſeaſonable jeſting and drollery, ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with many; though he was abundantly facetious in company, when and where he ſaw it expedient, and in this way ſometimes he has dropt what tended to edify. Thoſe who converſed moſt with him, will own, they ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom enjoyed his company without ſome profit by it. He oft was uneaſy after much converſe with others, if he was not edified himſelf, or thought he did not edity others; how circumſpect and tender was the ſtrain of his walk in this? He oft regretted the difficulty there was to retain integrity in the moſt part of company in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate age; he reckoned ſuch company a great hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and loth would he be to have let any thing offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive in converſe go without a check.</p>
            <p>The following memoirs will witneſs his walking with God in his family and cloſet: But ſome things here I cannot paſs; it was his ordinary, except he had been neceſſarily hindered, to come from his cloſet to family worſhip, eſ ecially if the Lord had given him enlargement of heart, and if his ſpirit was in a due frame; he would then have been very uneaſy, if any interruption fell in
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:030532_0022_0FE7C131588EBA58"/>betwixt cloſet and family duties. He alſo commonly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded the word of God, at leaſt once a day in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. The night before family faſts, which he kept, or national faſts, he always directed his ſervants how to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage that work, and on the faſt days themſelves diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them about their ſouls condition and concerns.</p>
            <p>He was an effectionate and dutiful huſband, a conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and kind parent, a faithful and eaſy maſter.</p>
            <p>Such as knew him, will own, he had a clear head, a very ready and rare invention, and uncommon memory; he read little after his health broke, and oft owned his greateſt improvement was more by thinking than reading.</p>
            <p>He had a very ready way of expreſſing his thoughts; he was far from a vain, airy affectation of language in preaching, (a prevailing evil in this time), he had ſtudied an even, neat and ſcriptural ſtile, and this became natural, though ſome thought in the end, his deep thinking made it a little more abſtruſe than formerly to a popular auditory.</p>
            <p>He had choice pulpit gifts, he was an accurate and pathetic preacher, a great textuary, cloſe in handling any truth he diſcourſed, and in the application, he was home, warm and ſearchings and in this he ſhewed uſually a ſkilful caſuiſt. He oft complained, that ſome worthy men were too general and bare in the application of their doctrines.</p>
            <p>He ordinarily wrote his ſermons very exactly, when health and buſineſs would allow; he uſed to ſay, "A lazy miniſter in his younger years would make a poor old man." It were to be wiſhed, that this example were more followed than it is. He oft adventured to preach under great indiſpoſition, when he was not able to write ſo much as the heads of his ſermon, yea, even at ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and he has been ſingularly aſſiſted, to the convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all that heard him. In his laſt two years he wrote little, his health then was ſo low.</p>
            <p>His experience of the power of godlineſs, with his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gifts mentioned, made him very ſkilful to deal with wounded ſpirits, according to the variety of their caſes; and this converſe he owned was extremly uſeful to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Few miniſters have taken a more cautions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming way of dealing with people, than he did before
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030532_0023_0FE7C0E02DA33658"/>be admitted them to the ſacrament; and while in health, he was diligent in the other parts of his ministerial work.</p>
            <p>He was no leſs ſingularly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>In centroverſies, eſpecially thoſe of the time, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled many. It was ſtrange to ſce <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THE common occurrences of the life of one in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects ſo inconſiderable, are not worth recording; and if recorded, could be of little uſe either to myſelf, or others.

And herein I am ſtrongly confirmed by undoubted experience, that ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinceth me, that from the morning of my days, while under the advantage of goſpel light, the inſpection of godly parents, and not yet corrupted by cuſtom, the imaginations of my heart, and the tenor of my life, were <hi>evil, only evit, and continually ſo,</hi> Gen. vi. 5, 8, 21.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It cannot be expected, that at ſo great a diſtance, I ſhould remember the particulars of that firſt three or four years of my life; yet I may on the juſteſt grounds pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, that they were fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>orth, and before we give any tolerable evidence that we are rational, we give full evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that we are corrupted, Pſal, lviii. 3. We ſhew that we are inclined to evil, by preſſing with impatience and eagerneſs for what is hurtful; and our averſion to good, by refuſing, with the greateſt obstinacy, what is ſit, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and uſeful to us. At firſt we are only employed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſenſible things, and about them we give the firſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences that our natures are corrupt. And with the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:030532_0026_0FE7A14C660BE610"/>of reaſon, the corruption of our ſpirit diſcovers itſelf. How early do our actings diſcover paſſion, pride, revenge, diſſimulation, and ſenſuality, to be inlaid, as it were, in our very conſtitution? Any ordinary obſerver may diſcern inſtances innumerable of this ſort, very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in children. With theſe and the like evils, no doubt, were the firſt years of my life, whereof I remember lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, filled up—<hi>Folly is bound up in the heart of a child,</hi> Prov. xxii. 15. <hi>and we go aſide as ſoon as borns ſpeaking lies,</hi> Pſal. lviii. 3.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In this firſt period of my life, I had advantages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove moſt. My parents were eminently religious. I was trained up under their eyes and inſpection, for moſt part. I continually heard the ſound of divine truths ringing in my ears, in their inſtructions; and I had the beauty of the practice of religion continually repreſented to mine eyes in their walk. I was, by their care, kept from ill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany that might infect me. By theſe means I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from thoſe groſſer out-breakings that children oft run into, and habituated to a form of religion, and put upon the performing of ſuch outward duties of religion as my years were capable of. Hence it appears, that the ſin I am now fully convinced that I wallowed in, during this tract of time, is not to be imputed, either as to inclination or actings, merely to contracted cuſtom, or occaſional temptations; but it really was the genuine fruit and reſult of that lamentable biaſs man ſince the fall is born with. Sure the ſpring muſt be within, when notwithſtanding all the care taken to keep me from them, I impetuouſly went on in ſinful courſes. The holy God hedged up my way by precepts, example, and diſcipline; but I broke through all. Sure the ſpring muſt be within. And ſure it muſt be very ſtrong, that was able to bear down ſuch powerful mounds [fences] as were ſet in its way, by the providence of God, and run with ſo full a ſtream, notwithſtanding all outward occaſions of its increaſe were cut off, as much as might be. Herein I have full evidence of a heart natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally eſtranged from, my oppoſite to the Lord. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, this deeply aggravates my guilt. <q>And they have turned unto me the back and not the face, though I
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:030532_0027_0FE7C0E7B3CFFE08"/>taught them riſing up early and teaching them, yet they have not hearkened to receive inſtruction,</q> Jer. xxii. 33.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The care of my father during his life, which ended October 1682, and of my mother after his death, though very great, did not change, but only hide <hi>nature;</hi> which is indeed often hidden, ſometimes overcome, ſeldom ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed. Albeit I cannot remember all the particulars from the fourth or fifth years of my life, yet ſo far I do remember what the general be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t of my heart was from that time. Upon a review, I muſt confeſs that it was wholly ſet againſt the Lord. <q>The carnal mind in enmity againſt God, it is not ſubject to the law of God, nor can it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be,</q> Rom. viii. 7.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To confirm this, when I now ſurvey the decalogue, and review this portion of my time, notwithſtanding of the great diſtance, I do diſtinctly remember, and were it to edification, could condeſcend upon particular inſtances of the opposition of my heart unto each of its precepts. Whatever influence ed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cation may have in moulding what is ſeen, yet ſurely <hi>the imaginations of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="6">6. True it is, through the influence of the means before mentioned, I did all this while abominate the more groſs breaches of all the commands, and diſlike open ſin. But meanwhile my heart was ſet upon the leſs diſcernible vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the ſame holy law. My quarrel was not with ſin, but with the conſequences of it; and the main thing I regarded was the world's opinion of it. Fear of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, pride that fears to be ill thought of, or at beſt, a natural conſcience enlightened by education, were the only ſprings of any performance of duty, or abſtinence from ſin. Prove I was all this while to ſin, even of all ſorts, which that age is carried into, in ſecret, when I could ſay, that <hi>no eye ſhall ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

7. Even thoſe things which, in my way, ſeemed good and promiſing, ſuch as deteſtation of groſs ſins, perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of duties, &amp;c, were either purely the effects of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible cuſtom, a bribe to a natural conſcience to hold its peace, a ſacrifice to ſelf, a ſlaviſh performance of what I took no delight in to avoid the whip, or ſometimes a charra to keep me from danger, which I thought would befai me, and dreaded much, if I neglected prayer. Thus my beſt things dreadfully increaſed my guilt; being like the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Sodom, fair to look at, promiſing while untried, but within full of aſhes and noiſome matter. <q>When ye falled and mourned in the fifth and ſeventh months, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven theſe ſeventy years, did ye at all fall unto me? And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did ye not eat for yourſelves?</q> Zech. vii. 5.6. <q>Bring no more vain oblations, incenſe is an abomination to me, the n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="8">8. Thus the ſpring of corruption, dammed in on the one ſide, I mean as to open profanity, by the mounds of education, breaks out on the other ſide, in a form of religion, (2 Tim. iii. 5.) without, nay plainly oppoſite to the power of it, which is no leſs hateful to the holy God: <hi>The prayer of the wicked is ſin, his ſacrifice is an abomination,</hi> Prov. xxi. 4, 27. xv. 8. Sin in the one caſe has a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle varniſh, that hides its deformity ſomewhat from the eyes of men; in the other, it is ſeen in its native hue and colours. In the one caſe it runs under ground: In the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it openly follows its courſe. <hi>Some men's ſons are open before hand, going before them to judgment, and others follow after,</hi> 1 Tim. v. 26. Whether the one or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the odds is not great. <hi>The tree is known by its fruit,</hi> Matth. xii. 33. <hi>A corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit.</hi> Sometimes it may bring forth <hi>good-like fruit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. But yet after all I muſt confeſs, that ſuch was the ſtrength of corruption, that it drove me to ſeveral of the more plain and groſs ſins, incident to this age: which though ſome account pardonable follies in children, yet the Lord makes another reckoning of them, and ſundry of them have been made bitter to me; ſuch as, lying, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:030532_0029_0FE7C0E9CF2793E0"/>puniſhment, Sabbath-breaking, reveage, hatred of my reprovers, and others of a like nature. Some particular ſins committed in childhood, which I had quite forgot as being attended with no notable circumſtances, that could make them ſtick, rather than other things, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an older date than any thing elſe I can remember, were brought freſh to my remembrance, when the Lord began cloſely to convince of ſin; and being preſented in their native colours, in the light of the Lord, and in all the circumſtances of time, place, partners in ſin, &amp;c. and were made the matter of deep humiliation, loathing, and ſelf-abhorrence, as not only full of wickedneſs in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but pregnant evidences of the deepeſt natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity. Which made me ſee to whom it was owing, that I went not to all the heights in wickedneſs, and the groſſeſt abominations, that ever any were carried to, and which a haeghty heart, if not reſtrained ſeaſonably, partly by ſecret power, and partly by outward means, would inevitably have carried me to. Prov. xxii. 15. <hi>Folly is bound up in the heart of a child,</hi> deeply root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and faſtened there. And no thanks to the beſt, that they are kept from the worſt things. <q>And David ſaid to Abigail, Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael, which ſent thee this day to meet me, and bleſſed be thy advice, and bleſſed be thou, which haſt kept me this day from coming to ſhed blood, and from avenging myſelf with mine own hand.</q> 1 Sam. xxv. 32. <q>For in very deed, as the Lord God of Iſrael liveth, which hath kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadſt haſted and come to meet me, ſurely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that piſſeth againſt the wall.</q> What a monſter had I been, if leſt to myſelf, and not ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably reſtrained by outward means, and inward power! bleſſed be the inviſible hand, and the outward inſtruments of this reſtraint, that kept me back from finning.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

What exact notice the holy God takes, and how deeply he reſents thoſe things, which men generally will ſcarce allow <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

God eaſily obſerved, that man's imaginations are evil from his youth, and will have us mind, and be humbled for the ſins that have cleaved to us from our youth. <hi>This hath been thy manner from thy youth, that thou obeyedſt not my voice,</hi> Jer. xxii. 21<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> is an aggravation of other ſins he charges on his people, and in itſelf one heavy article. 2. How much reaſon is there for reckoning it up as one great part of the wicked's mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, that <hi>they lie down in their graves with bones full of the ſins of youth?</hi> Job xx. ii.

I here obſerve what an exact regiſter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, God's deputy, keeps; how early it begins to mark, how accurate it is, even when it ſeems to take no notice, and to what a length it will go in juſtifying God's ſeverity againſt ſinners at the laſt day; how diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly and clearly it will read out, and how far up it will fetch its accounts of thoſe evils which we mind nothing of, when God ſhall open its eyes to read what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and diſcern thoſe p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

For, 1. The bent of my ſoul from a child was ſet againſt the Lord. Nor was this the effect of cuſtom and education; for there was a ſweet conſpiracy of precept, diſcipline, and example of thoſe with whom I converſed, during this firſt part of my life, to carry me another way. Nor can I charge the fault of this on my conſtitution of body, or any ſuch thing, as might be alledged to proceed from my parents in a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral way. For thoſe Juſts which are <hi>of the mind,</hi> Eph. i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="33" facs="unknown:030532_0032_0FE7C13ACAA8FD18"/>nay, more than theſe which may be pretended to depend on the frame of the body. And as my ſoul in its accurſed inclinations was thus oppoſive to the Lord, ſo the oppoſition was of that ſtrength and force, as was not to be ſuppreſſed, much leſs to be overcome and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, by the utmoſt care of parents, and the beſt outward means. This is undoubted fact. 2. I cannot a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To ſay I was thus originally framed, without reſpect to any ſin chargeable on me, is a poſition ſo full of flat contrariety to all the notions I can entertain of the Deity, that I cannot think of it without horror, much leſs can I believe and give aſſent to it. 3. Penal then this corruption muſt be, as death and diſeaſes are. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of can it be a puniſhment, if not of Adam's ſin? While thoſe things are ſo plain in fact, and the deduction ſo eaſy from them, whatever ſubtile arguments any uſe to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw this truth, I have no reaſon to be much ſhaken or moved with them, or call the truth in queſtion. If once I am ſure, that God hath done a thing, there is no room left for diſputing its equity. I am ſure, I was corrupt from my infancy. I am ſure, God could not have made me ſo without cauſe, or ſent me into the world in ſuch a caſe, if it had not been for ſome fault wherein I am concerned. If there is any attempt to charge God on this ſcore, I look upon it as highly injurious. There is no more l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This has ſtaid my ſoul againſt the moſt ſubtile arguings of men of perverſe minds, and even of Satan, who hath oft aſſaulted me in this inſtance. Be their arguments what they will, (Job xxiii. 12, 13, 17.) <hi>Behold in this they are not juſt: I will anſwer thee, that God is greater than man. Why doſt thou ſtrive againſt him? For he giveth not an account of his matters. That he may withdraw man from this,</hi> among other evil purpoſes of meaſuring God by his ſhort line, <hi>and hide pride from his eye.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p n="1">IN the month of May 1685, my mother being by the heat of the perſecution obliged to retire to Holland, I went along with her. While we were at ſea, being in ſome real or apprehended danger, my conſcience, which had for all the by gone ten years, ſo far as I can now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, been faſt aſleep, began to awaken. I was hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged for fin, terrified with the apprehenſions of hell and death, and the wrath of God, which I had no thought about before I was brought to this diſtreſs: Jer. ii. 27. <hi>They have turned their back unto me, and not their face: Eat in the time of their trouble they ſhall ſay, Ariſe, and ſave us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. All this concern was nothing more than a ſad mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of natural ſear, and a ſelfiſh deſire of preſervation from the danger that was ſuppoſed imminent, at leaſt by me. Peace, acceptance, communion with God, came not much in my thoughts. I was afraid and unwilling to die. I would gladly have been out of danger of hell. This was all my exerciſe at this time. It was not ſin, but death, its conſequence, I was concerned to be rid of: Exod. x. 16. <hi>Then Pharaoh called for Moſes and Aaron in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="36" facs="unknown:030532_0035_0FE7C0F6DFCC9060"/>therefore I pray thee, forgive my ſin only this once, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat the Lord your God, that he may take away from me this death only.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. As this exerciſe was wholly ſelfiſh, without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for the Lord's glory, ſo it led me to ſelfiſh courſes for relief. I promiſed, that were I at land, I would live and be better than formerly. I engaged to keep all God's commands. My mother told me, I was in a miſtake, and would not hold there. But there was no perſuading one ſo ignorant of his own heart, as I at this time was, of this. I multiplied engagements, and doubted not my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as to the performance: Joſh. xxiv. 16. <hi>And the people anſwered, God forbid that we ſhould forſake the Lord to ſerve other gods.</hi> Ver. 9. <hi>And Joſhua ſaid unto the people, Ye cannot ſerve the Lord; for he is an holy God.</hi> Ver. 21. <hi>And the people ſaid unto Joſhua, Nay, but we will ſerve the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. No ſooner was I come to land, and fixed at Rotter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, but I verified what had been foretold. I forgot all my promiſes and reſolutions. The unrenewed and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt heart, being free from the force put upon it by the natural conſcience under appearance of hazard, took its old courſe. I returned to former evils, and grew worſe. Corruption, that had been dammed in for a little, having eaſily forced down all theſe mounds raiſed to hold it in, run with the greater violence. It is true, through the mercy of God, I was ſtill reſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ined from open ſcandalous ſins. Toward which the awe of my godly and prudent mother, and principles of education, did contribute not a little. But as to ſecret evils of all ſorts I had no averſion to them: Nay, to many of them I was ſtrongly inclined, and in many inſtances followed my own inclinations. I was a ready and eaſy prey to every temptation, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all my engagements; Jer. ii. 20. <hi>And then ſaidſt, I will not tranſgreſs, when upon every high hill, and under every green tree thou wandereſt, playing the harlot.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. My ſins, in this place, had this grievous aggravation, that they were againſt greater light, and more of the means of grace than I had formerly enjoyed. On the Lord's day we had three ſermons and two lectures in the Scots church; on Thurſday, a ſermon there likewiſe. On

On Saturday he catechiſed the children of the Scots ſufferers who came to him. My mother took care to have me attend mod of theſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, was careful to keep me to duty, was not wanting in advice, correction, prayer with and for me; ſhe obliged me to read the ſcriptures and other edifying books. But ſo far were all theſe from obtaining a due effect on me, that I was weary of them, and went on in ſin: Iſa. v. 4. <hi>What could have been done more,</hi> (viz. in point of outward means), <hi>to my vineyard, that I have not d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Jer. ii. 6, 7. <q>Neither ſaid they. Where is the Lord that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderneſs, through a land of deſerts, and of pits, through a land of drought, and of the ſhadow of death.—And I

Ezek. xx. 6, 8, 9. <q>I lifted up my hand unto them, to bring them out of the land of Egypt.—But they rebelled againſt me, and would not hearken unto me.—Then ſaid I, I will pour out my fury upon them.—But I wrought for my name's ſake.</q> Ezek. xxxvi. 32. <q>Not for your ſakes do I this, ſaith the Lord God, be it known unto you: Be aſhamed and confounded for your ways, O honſe of Iſrael.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Here the Lord caſt my lot under choice means of grace; the miniſtry of worthy Mr. Thomas Forreſter. Under his ſearching miniſtry, the Lord began to give me ſome ſmall diſcoveries of the more ſecret and ſpiritual evils of my heart, and carried me (Ezek. viii. 12.) <hi>into the ſecret chambers of imagery,</hi> to let me ſee what my heart did <hi>in the dark. 1ſt,</hi> He opened mine eyes to diſcern ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of that world of pride that is in the heart, and the wickedneſs of it. Though I was ſome way convinced of my own weakneſs, when I had any difficulty more than ordinary before me, and would ſeek help from God, yet when I got through, I valued myſelf upon my acquittance. Of the wickedneſs and unjuſtneſs of this, the Lord in ſome meaſure convinced me: I Cor. iv. 7. <q>What haft thou, O man, that thou haft not received? And if thou haft received, wherefore doſt thou boaſt?</q> 
                     <hi>2dly,</hi> He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced me of the wickedneſs of the ſtraying of my heart after idols, eſpecially in the time of worſhip: Ezek. xi. 21. <q>But as for them whoſe heart walked after the heart of their deteſtable things, and their abominations, I will recompence their ways upon their own heads, ſaith the Lord God.</q> Ezek. xiv. 4, 6. <q>For every one of the houſe of Iſrael, or of the ſtranger—which fetteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the ſtumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to enquire of him concerning me, I the Lord will
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:030532_0053_0FE7C1641D6880E0"/>anſwer him by myſelf.</q> I was made to ſee, in ſome meaſure, the danger of offering ſuch duties to him, who requireth us, Deut. xxxii. 46. <hi>to ſet our hearts</hi> to what he ſpeaks, and to <hi>keep our feet when we come to the houſe of God,</hi> Eccl. v. i. <hi>3dly,</hi> I was likewiſe made to ſee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of my truſting to my duties, and reſting on the bare performance, inaſmuch as I was not for moſt part challenged for unſuitable performance, but for the intire o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>iſſion of them), and with the Phariſee I thought it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, if I could ſay, that I did the duty. But now the Lord let me ſee, that more was required; though with him I could ſay, <hi>I faſted twice a week,</hi> Luke xviii. 12. the Lord convinced me, that he might anſwer, <hi>When ye faſted, did ye at faſt unto me, even to me?</hi> Zech. vi. 5.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Theſe, when added to former diſcoveries of guilt, gave frequently much diſturbance, and caſt me into rack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perplexity and diſquietment; but the darkneſs and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of my mind remaining, I ſtill had recourſe to wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and vain courſes for peace, ſuch as theſe formerly mentioned; but they afforded me little quiet. Pharaoh-like, I engaged to amend thoſe things wherein formerly I had failed; but, with him, I quickly broke, when the force that drove to this was over. At laſt finding no peace in any of theſe courſes, I reſolved to enter into ſolemn covenant with the Lord; and accordingly I wrote and ſubſcribed a ſolemn covenant, whereby I bound myſelf to be for God: like Iſrael, when under the awful impreſſions of Sinai, and the dreadful appearance of God there, I ſaid, Deut. v. 23, 28. <q>All that the Lord our God ſhall ſay unto us, we will hear and do it:</q> And like the ſcribe that came to Chriſt, Luke ix. 57. <q>Maſter I will follow thee whitherfoever thou goeſt.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. When I had once done this, then I concluded all was right: For, I. I found a ſort of preſent peace. Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I thought ſufficient attonement, and ſuch an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I looked on as performance. I now ſaid, Prov. vii. 14. <q>I have peace-offerings with me: this day I have paid my vows.</q> 2. I at this time found frequently an unuſual ſweetneſs in hearing of the word; eſpecially in hearing Mr. Forreſter lecture on Acta xiii. 53. on the Sabbath night. Here as I received ſometime the moſt
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:030532_0054_0FE7C1BF808D4BE0"/>piercing convictions, 1 Cor. xiv. 25. ſo I received <hi>teſtes of the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,</hi> Heb. vi. 5. Thus, like the ſtony ground, <q>I heard the word, and anon with joy received it,</q> Match. xiii. 20.3. Common gifts increaſing as light grew, I took them for ſpecial grace; and thus have taken up, with the fooliſh virgins, <hi>the lamp</hi> of a profeſſion <hi>without oil,</hi> Match. xxv. 1. I began to ſet up for a virgin too, and like ſuch I began to be eſteemed, by ſome of them, for that which I really was not, but only appeared to be.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But the merciful and good God would not ſuffer me to reſt here. Jer. ii. 35, 36, 37. <q>Yet thou ſayeſt, Becauſe I am innocent, ſurely his anger ſhall turn from me. Behold I will plead with thee, becauſe thou ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, I have not finned. Why gaddeſt thou about ſo much to change thy way? Thou alſo ſhalt be aſhamed of Egypt, as thou waſt aſhamed of Aflyria. Yea thou ſhalt go forth from him, and thine hands upon thine head: For the Lord hath rejected thy confidences, and thou ſhalt not proſper in them.</q> The Lord quickly let me ſee my miſtake: For, I. The imaginary peace that I had by making this covenant, was quickly loſt by breaking it. Corruption retaining ſtill its power, its locks not being yet cut, whenever a temptation offered; Judges xvi. 21. like Sampſon upon a cry of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines being on him, it broke all thoſe ties, with which I fooliſhly, like his deceived miſtreſs, thought it bound: Like the children of Iſrael at Sinai <note n="*" place="bottom">Deut. v. 27. &amp;c. compared with Numb. xxiii. 16. and Numb. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The Lord's wrath hereon being afreſh intimated againſt me, as it was againſt them on that occaſion. 2. Not only upon ſuch breaches met I with challenges, but old ones were revived; and by this I found former accounts ſtill to be ſtanding againſt me, which filled me with conſuſion, and jealouſies of theſe
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:030532_0055_0FE7C165A69AA120"/>ways, Jer. ii. 22. <q>For though thou waſh thee with nitre, and take thee much ſoap, yet thine iniquity is marked before me, ſaith the Lord.</q> 3. The Lord inſinuated ſome diſcovery of the treachery of my engagements: let me ſee how my heart was not ſound, and how there were ſecret reſerves in my engagements for ſome ſins from which my heart was not divorced; though yet I remember, that at the time I made thoſe engagements, when my heart put in for ſparing theſe, my light forced me, as it were for the preſent, though not without reluctancy, to give them up, at leaſt in words; but really I did not do it. Now the Lord gave ſome intimations of this heart-treachery, which when further diſcovered by the event, my covenant could not quiet me about. Deut. v. 29. <q>They have well ſpoken all that they have ſaid. O that there ſuch a heart in them.</q> 4. The Lord le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For the bed is ſhorter, than that a man can ſtretch him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on it: And the covering narrower, than that he can wrap himſelf in it.</q> This I found verified to my ſad experience.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Notwithſtanding the felt vanity of theſe legal, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh, anti evangelical courſes, I ſtill cleaved to them: For, I. The peace I loſt by breaking, I ſtill endea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

My heart, when I was defeat, gave me ſuel advice as the king of Syria got from his ſervants, when he was defeat by Iſrael—<q>Number an army like thou haſt loſt, horſe for horſe, and chariot for chariot, and we will ſight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

I laid the blame ſtill on ſome accidental defect in my former management, and I thought were that provided againſt all would be well. 2. When ſtill I found ſomething wanting, I caſt about in my own mind, and contrived to make it up with ſomething estraordinary of my own; the multiplacation of duties, or ſome ſuch thing or other. Micah vi. 6, 7. <q>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhall I come before the Lord, and bow myſelf before the high God?

Iſa. xxx. 1, 2, 3. <q>Wo to the rebellious children, ſaith the Lord, that take counſel, but not of me: And that cover with a covering, but not of my ſpirit, that they may add fin to ſin: That walk to go down to Egypt, and have not aſked at my mouth, to ſtrengthen themſelves in the ſtrength of Pharoah, and to truſt in the ſhadow of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt. Therefore ſhall the ſtrength of Pharaoh be your ſhame, and the ſhadow of Egypt your confuſion.</q> Now, as I was really miſerable in following theſe courſes, ſo, if the Lord of inſinite mercy had not prevented it, I had landed in one of four ſad iſſues, wherein oft times ſuch exerciſes and courſes terminate; either, 1. If I had been freed from convictions, or the L rd had given over his striving with me, and carrying on the work of convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; after convictions had carried me the length of a form of religion, I had ſurely, notwithſtanding all the diſappointments, ſitten down ſatisfied with that, as having <hi>found the life of my hand;</hi> or having, by the endeavours of my hand and its labour, obtained that which would give me a ſort of life, Iſa. lvii. 10. <q>Thou art wearied in the greatneſs of my way, yet ſaidſt thou not, There is no hope: Thou haſt found the life of thine hand (that is, a ſort of life by thy labour), therefore thou waſt not grieved.</q> Or, 2. If convictions had been carried on,
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:030532_0057_0FE7C16B58CA2930"/>and the Lord had leſt me to follow thoſe courſes I took, I would have. (Hab. ii. 13. <q>laboured in the fire all my days, wearied and vexed myſelf for very vanity; (Iſa lv. 2.) ſpending my money for that which is not bread, and my labour for that which doth not profit;</q> in a continual viciſſitude of vows, covenants, engagements, and reſolutions; breaches and diſquietments, engagements and falſe peace, breachea and racking convictions, would alternately having taken place. <q>And thus I had ſpent my days, and at the end been a fool,</q> Jer, xvii, 11. Or, 3. After I had weatied myſelf for a while in thoſe vain ways, I would utterly have given up with religion as a vain thing, and ſaid, with thoſe mentioned by the prophet, who ſaid, <q>It is vain to ſerve the Lord; and and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinances, and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of hoſts?</q> Mal. iii. 14. And ſo with them I had gone over to plain atheiſm and proſanity. Or, 4. Being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſeek ſhelter from my convictions; and being ſo oft and ſadly diſappointed by all the ways I tried, I had at laſt ended in deſpair, like Judas; and ſaid, 2 Kings vi, 33. 'This evil is of the Lord, why wait I any longer, like that wicked king? And in very deed I had ſome experience of all theſe iſſues. Sometimes I ſat down with the form, Rev. iii. 17. <q>and judged I was rich and increaſed in goods, and ſtood in need of nothing.</q> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I wearied myſelf in running from one of thoſe vain courſes to another.

                  <p n="9">9. When I was thus diſappointed, eſpecially after the making, and frequent repeating of vows and engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I was caſt into the utmoſt perplexity to find where the fault lay. I found this way of covenanting with God recommended by miniſters, mentioned in the ſcripture, and the people of God declared they had, found the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of it. I could not challenge myſelf, at leaſt at ſome times, for known guile in the making of it. What I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to do, I was reſolved upon at the time. I did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage with much concern and ſolemnity; and for ſome
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:030532_0058_0FE7C1C6464CB778"/>time after, I would have walked with much ſtrictneſs: But though I could not then diſcern where the blame lay, I have ſince been made to ſee it. I. <q>Being ignorant of the righteouſneſs of God, I ſtill went about to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a righteouſneſs of my own,</q> Rom. x. 3. And though in words I renounced this, yet indeed I ſought righteouſneſs and peace, not in the <q>Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is the end of the law for righteouſneſs to every one that believes,</q> (Rom. x. 4.) but in my own covenants and engagements; ſo that I really put them in Chriſt's room. 2. Whatever room I, in words, allowed Chriſt, as to forgiveneſs for by gones, yet my peace and hope of it for the future, and ſo my truſt, was in the evenneſs of my own walk. I obtained not righteouſneſs, becauſe I ſought it <hi>as it were by the works of the law,</hi> Rom. ix. 32. This neglect of Chriſt, and ſhuffling my own cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents and obedience in his room, was evident; becauſe whenever I was challenged for ſin, inſtead of recourſe to his blood, I ſtill ſought peace only in renewing my vows. 3. The conſent I gave to the law, was not from the reconcilement of my heart to its holineſs, but merely, in compliance with the conſtraint put upon me by my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions. But in very deed (Rom. viii. 7.) <hi>the enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it</hi> ſtill continued. And I would not have made it my choice, if that had not forced me to it: ſo that I ſubjected not myſelf to it. 4. I engaged to live a new life with an old heart, not being yet made to ſee, that <hi>unleſs the tree is made good the fruit cannot be good,</hi> Matth. xii. 35.5. <hi>The eye was not ſingle,</hi> Matth. xix. 16. vi. 22. All I aimed at was ſelf, to be eaſed of convictions, and obtain peace from theſe racking diſquietments I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. I had not the leaſt concern for the Lord's glory, provided I were ſafe. 6. In a word, I engaged before the Lord had thoroughly engaged me. We may be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing <hi>in ſome ſort,</hi> before the Lord hath made us truly wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. I. John iv. 10. The firſt real kindneſs begins on his ſide; and we are never engaged to love till the Lord's kindneſs do draw us. The force of a ſtrait, by convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, may overpower us into ſome pretenſions of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; thus it was with me. Willing I was to be ſaved from hell, and to have heaven, under the general notion

                  <p n="12">12. Though the atheiſm and enmity of my heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God were ſtill unremoved and great, yet the Lord ſuffered me not to yield, but made me dread and recoil at the terrible concluſion aimed at by thoſe arguings. For, 1. There remained ſo much of that natural knowledge of a Deity, which God hath made manifeſt even in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, that is, in their conſciences, Rom. i. 9. and there was ſo much of ſtrength added to it by the external evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this truth, by the works of creation and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as made me recoil at the thoughts of that horrible concluſion of the atheiſt, <hi>There is no God.</hi> 2. Being at the ſame time, deeply affected with deep apprehenſions of the ſhortneſs and uncertainty of a preſent life, I dreaded to admit the concluſion, that I ſaw would ſhake the foundations of any hope of relief for the future from the other ſide of time, Pſal. xi. 3. <hi>If the foundations be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, what hath the righteous done?</hi>

                  <p n="13">13. In this ſtrait, betwixt light that would not admit of a flat denial of <hi>the being of a God,</hi> and atheiſm enflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſtrengthened by Satan's fiery darts, I betook my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſtill to vain and ſelfiſh courſes. My diſturbance was from reaſonings, and I thought to relieve myſelf by my own reaſonings. Nothing more, did I fooliſhly think, can be requiſite to eſtabliſh my mind about this truth, and for ever to quiet my mind in a firm aſſent to it, than to obtain demonſtrative arguments for the being of a God: Thus I thought <hi>by ſearching to find out God,</hi> Job xi. 7. And like the Pſalmiſt, when ſhaken about the providence of God, Pſal. lxxiii. 16. <hi>I thought to know it.</hi> That is, by own reaſonings, I expected to obtain eſtabliſhment in the truth, and an anſwer to the objections urged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Wherefore I ſeriouſly ſet myſelf to the ſearch of ſuch arguments; and I found them; but found not that relief I expected: Pſal. lxxiii. 16. <hi>When I thought to

The moſt ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening and forcible of thoſe arguments, proceeding upon the abſurdity of the contrary concluſion with great evidence, would not allow of any thing to be ſaid to the argument, and ſo extorted an aſſent: But not enlightening the mind with any ſatisſying notions and diſcoveries of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Theſe arguments forced indeed ſome aſſent in the time: But not diſſolving contrary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, whenever the light of them was removed, and contrary objections came in view again, I was intirely ſhaken, like him in Cicero, who read Plato's arguments for the immortality of the ſoul, and ſaid, <q>When I re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I. <hi>reproves</hi> contrary arguings, and plants in the ſoul an abiding light, that keeps the ſoul firm in its adherence to truth. Thus, like the philoſophers of old, I Cor. i. 21 <hi>In the wiſdom of God, by wiſdom I knew not God.</hi>

Though I was thus intangled rather than extrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by theſe ſelfiſh ſhifts, yet my vain mind ſtill follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe courſes. For, I. What hitherto I had ſailed of, I expected I might find by ſome further progreſs in learning; and therefore I applied myſelf vigorouſly that way. But any little progreſs I made, made me ſtill more ſenſible how far I was diſappointed, and made me experience the truth of this, <hi>that he that increaſeth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, increaſeth ſorrow,</hi> Eccl. i. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When this courſe could not avail, then I ſpent my weary hours in vain wiſhes for ſome extraordinary diſcoveries: Luke xvi. 20. <hi>Nay, but if one riſe from the dead, they will believe.</hi>

16. Though I reached not the ſatisfaction I aimed at, yet I cannot but ſay this exerciſe had ſome uſeful effects. I. It let me ſee, that I had need of ſome further evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and eſtabliſhment about the truths of religion, than hitherto I had either attained or wiſt how to attain. Thus I had got ſome view of it before: Now I was more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirmed of. 2. My mind being ſometimes more quieted as to theſe truths in hearing of the word, than by all my arguments, I was inclined to hope, this evidence I wanted might come from the Lord. 3. I was beat ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what from that towering opinion of my own knowledge and abilities to know, that my firſt ſeeming ſucceſs in in philoſophy gave me, and brought to an uſeful diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of my inability to reach ſatisfaction, even about natural things, and ſolve objections that lay againſt truths, which yet upon clear argument, I was forced to admit: Which afterwards was of confiderable uſe to me.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. But during this period of time, under ali theſe wreitlings and ſtrugglings betwixt growing light and ſin, corruptions, as I grew in years, grew ſtronger and ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, took deeper root, and received an increaſe of ſtrength by occaſional temptations, and new force from the weak reſiſtance made to them by theſe vain courſes, Rom. vii. 8, 9, 11. As <hi>the law came</hi> nearer, in its ſpiritual mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and extent, ſin revived, and appeared more diſcerni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in its ſtrength; <hi>and ſin taking occaſion by the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wrought in me inclinations to all evil.</hi> Being fretted, not ſubdued, it grew ſtronger, till at length it ſlew me.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. Under this perplexity, I betook myſelf ſtill to one or other of the fore-mentioned vain courſes: Jer. ii. 36. <hi>I gadded about to change my way, ſent to Egypt, went to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p n="19">19. However, by theſe means I was brought to a ſpecious like form of religion. For now, 1. I took ſome care to avoid thoſe ſins, whether ſecret or open, that thwarted the light of my conſcience moſt plainly. I not only obſtained from theſe evils, to which moſt, even of the ſoberer ſort of ſtudents, were ſrequently drawn over;
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:030532_0063_0FE7C175F67AEA28"/>but with a ſort of reſolution I kept at a diſtance from the occaſions of them. Thus I begun, 2 Pet. ii. 20. <hi>to eſcape the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the truth.</hi> 2. I was more exact and punctual in attending duties, public, private, and ſecret, than heretofore, and that not without ſome concern, at leaſt at ſometimes, as to my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward frame in them. Thus I thought <hi>I kept his ordinances,</hi> Mal. ii. 14.3. When I was enſnared, either into the commiſſion of ſin, or omiſſion of duty, I was brought to a deep ſorrow; and for ſome time <hi>walked mournf lly before God,</hi> ibid. 4. Whereas I always had a ſort of aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful regard for them that ſeared God, ſince ever I began to be in the leaſt awakened, now I begun to have a ſort of liking and kindneſs to them, and pleaſure in their company and converſe, even about matters of religion. Thus light forced an approbation of them on my mind, and ſo to <hi>give glory to God; their light ſo ſhining before me,</hi> Matth. v. 16. that I could not but take notice of them. 5. I had frequent <hi>taſtes of the word of God; and the powers of the world to come,</hi> Heb. vi. 5. which made me delight, in approaching to God. And, 6. I got ſome things that looked like return of prayer, when, under a ſenſe of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, I betook myſelf to God by prayer. In any ſtrait, I found help ſo remarkable, that I could not but take notice of it. The Lord hereby drew me gradually in to expect good in his way; and, though I was wrong in the main, as it were encouraged the fainteſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of a look toward a return. 1 Kings xxi. 19. <hi>And the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tiſhbite, ſaying, Seeſt thou how Ahab humbleth himſelf before me: Becauſe he humbleth himſelf before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: But in his ſon's days I will bring the evil upon his houſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="20">20. Now, though by theſe means I got a name to live, yet really I was dead: For, 1. The natural darkneſs ſtill remained uncured. Some dawnings of light were indeed begun, and ſome diſcoveries made of what formerly I had not known, yet the power of darkneſs ſtill remained, and <hi>the vail was not yet taken away, nor were ſpiritual things ſeen in a true light,</hi> 2 Cor. iii. 14, 15. Eph. iv. 18.
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:030532_0064_0FE7C1D35715A330"/>2. The enmity of my mind againſt the law <note n="*" place="bottom">Compare Rom. vil. 8. with Rom. vii. 12, 22.</note>, eſpecially in ſome inſtances, remained in force; there was not <hi>a reſpect to all God's commands,</hi> Pſal. cxix. 6. I had not yet a ſight of the beauty of holineſs. Nor did I in my heart approve of the whole yoke of Chriſt's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, as good and deſirable. It was not that I delighted in holineſs and conformity to the law, at leaſt in ſome inſtances, but that I was undone without it, that made me aim at any ſort of compliance. 3. <hi>I yet ſought righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs as it were by the works of the law,</hi> Rom. ix. 32. I was wholly legal in all I did, not ſeeing the neceſſity, the ſecurity, the glory of the goſpel method of ſalvation, by <hi>ſeeking righteouſneſs and ſtrength in the Lord Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,</hi> Rom. x. 4. Pſal. lxxi. 16.4. Self was the ſpring of all: My only aim was to be ſaved, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard had to the glory of the Lord, or any enquiry made, how it might be conſiſtent with it to ſave one who had ſo deeply offended? In a word, all my religion was conſtrained, violent, ſelfiſh, legal, and anti-evangelical. Theſe, not to mention other things, were ſtill wrong.</p>
                  <p>Reflections upon the foregoing exerciſe.</p>
                  <p>IT will not be improper to review the preceding exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and offer two or three obſervations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The foregoing exerciſe affords me full confirmation of many of the truths conteſted by the Pelagians and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, concerning man's inability to good, and the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of his nature. When I read and hear their high ſwelling words of vanity, in commendation of man, and in praiſe of his free will to good, and his good inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and when I hear ſpecious like arguments offered for proof of theſe notions, I have no reaſon to be ſhaken. Will they diſpute me out of my ſenſes? May I not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the word? Or maſt I wreſt and diſtort ſcriptures to make places that appear unfavourable to free will, accord with theſe notions of it which ſome advance? Sure I am, if they will not allow ſcripture to be its own interpreter, it is ſafer, at leaſt in theſe things that concern our own natural ſtate, which conſcience may know, to admit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:030532_0065_0FE7C17B48EC39B8"/>to comment, rather than reaſon proceeding upon abſtract notions: And where ſcripture and experience join, there we have the fulleſt confirmation of the truths that are <hi>eſtabliſhed in the mouth of two ſuch witneſſes;</hi> the laſt not only confirming, but illuſtrating the teſtimony of the former. If they ſay that their hearts are not ſo perverſe and ill inclined, and that they find inclinations to good in them, I cannot ſay ſo of mine: Yet by the way I muſt obſerve, that is their practice they go ſeldom further, if ſo far as others, who agree with me in owning their hearts ſo wicked, their corruptions ſo ſtrong, their wills ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, and ſet upon evil, that they can do nothing well pleaſing to God: Now ſurely, if matters are as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent them, they are far to blame. As for me, I find more ſolid truth in that one ſcripture, that tells us, that <hi>that the heart is deceitful above all things and deſperately wicked,</hi> Jer. xvii. 9. than in many volumes of idle anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural notions, reared up on the ſubtile arguings of men, whoſe eyes have never yet been opened to ſee the plagues of their own hearts, and who therefore run out in aſſerting ſuch an ability and power, and inclination to good in man, as neither ſcripture, nor the experience of ſuch as have their eyes in the leaſt meaſure opened, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of. However, if others will think that there are ſuch good inclinations in them, I muſt quit my part in them. Woſul experience convinces me, and obliges me to acknowledge, to my own ſhame, that I never looked towards the Lord's way, ſave when he drew me, Jer. xxxi. 18. <hi>I was as a bullock unaccuſtomed to the yoke;</hi> I never went longer in it than the force laſted; I inclined to ſit down, and ſat indeed down at every ſtep—no great ſign I had any heart to the way! I never got up again, but when the Lord's power was anew put forth. I all this while never went one ſtep but with a grudge, Gen. xix. 26. <hi>I frequently looked back to Sodom; I have been as a backſliding heifer.</hi> I was grieved for what I left behind; my heart clave to what my light had the greateſt oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to: Job xxiv. 13. Thus I was of them that rebel againſt the light: I oft refuſed where the command was plaineſt; when I was brought into a ſtrait, I betook my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf rather to any ſhift than to Chriſt; Prov. xxviii. 16. Sin bit me, and yet I loved it; my heart deceived
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:030532_0066_0FE7C1D4E11AEE08"/>me oft, and yet I truſted in it rather than God: Jer. xvii. 5, 7. God dealt with me in a way of kindneſs, but when he ſpoke to me in my proſperity, I would not hear: Iſa. lvii. 17. <hi>He ſmote me and I went on frowardly.</hi> I never parted with any ſin till God beat and drave me from it, and hedged in my way. Surely this looks like <hi>the heart deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked,</hi> Jer. xvii. 9.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The foregoing exerciſe clears what a depth of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs is in the heart of man. How many ſhifts has my heart uſed to elude the deſign of all thoſe <hi>ſtrivings of the Lord's ſpirit with me?</hi> What ſtrange ſhifts has the heart of man, and how many are they! I have told many, but <hi>the one half is not told.</hi> All theſe ſhifts reſpect but one point in religion. If one would undertake to give an account but of thoſe deceits, which are more noted, with reſpect to the whole of his walk and way, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny volumes might be written! There is much true di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity couched in that ſhort ſcripture, Jer. xvii. 9. <hi>The heart is deceitful above all things, who can know it?</hi> Pſal. xix. 12. <hi>Who can unaerſland his errors?</hi> When I upon a review mind ſo many, how many more might I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed if I had obſerved them in the time, or ſoon after? and if ſo many may be ſeen, how many ſecret, undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernible, or at leaſt undiſcerned, deceits are there?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. How far may we go in religion, and yet come ſhort? Many things I ſeemed to have and do: Mark vi. 20. <q>I did many things, and heard gladly; I was almoſt perſuaded to be a Chriſtian,</q> Acts xxvi. 28. <q>I ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to eſcape the pollutions that are in the world by the knowledge of the truth,</q> 2 Pet. ii. 20. <q>I ſeemed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, and partaker of the heavenly gift, and got ſome taſtes of the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,</q> Heb. vi. 5. I underwent many changes. and yet all the while was naught, defective as to the main: <q>Many ſhall ſeek to enter in, and ſhall not be able,</q> Luke xiii. 24. <q>Not every one that ſays, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the kingdom of God,</q> Matth. vii. 21.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I cannot but look back with wonder, to the aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing patience of God, that <hi>ſuffered my manners</hi> (Acts xiii. 18.) ſo long, and the ſteadineſs he ſhews in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:030532_0067_0FE7C17CD50D5FB0"/>his work, notwithſtanding many provocations to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſt, <hi>ſtill working for his name's ſake,</hi> Ezek. xx. 14. All the creation could not have a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>forded ſo much patience. The diſciples of Chriſt would have called <hi>for fire from heaven,</hi> Luke ix. 54. Yea Moſes, the meekeſt man on earth, would have found more to irritate him here, than at Meribah, Num. xx. 13. Glory to God, that we have to do with him, and not with man. <hi>His ways are not our ways. Nor his thoughts ours. But as the heavens are high above the earth, ſo are his ways and thoughts</hi> of mercy <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ours,</hi> Iſa. lv. 8.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. I muſt bear witneſs to the rationalneſs of God's way. For, 1. Theſe things he put me under concern about, deliverance from wrath, eternal ſalvation, and ſecurity about them, were ſuch as my own reaſon, upon the beſt attention, could not but own worthy of the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt and firſt concern. He did not call me to vex my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf about-vanity, and the things of no importance. 2. The way he dealt with me in, was not deſtructive to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of my faculties, but improved them. He enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened my eyes to ſee what he would have me to do; and he forced, not my will, but ſwayed it in a way ſuitable to its nature, to a compliance, ſo far as I went. This was not to force, but gently to bend the will, to theſe things that really were proper for it to incline to. 3. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways obſerved the true order of the ſaculties. He ſway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the will, ſo far as it went in compliance with his work, by ſending forth his light into the mind, that in the true order of things, ſhould guide the underſtanding. 4. He carried me on to conſideration. He did not ſeek, as it were, to entangle the affections, and by them carry my mind away in a hurry, as ſin and Satan are wont to do, who guide ſinners, as the Philiſtines did Sampſon, they firſt put out theireyes, and then make them grind in their mill. 5. The Lord never obliged me to part with any way, any ſin, or refuge I betook myſelf to, till he had let. me ſee, that it was not only againſt my duty, but my true intereſt. 6. So far as I complied with his call, I cannot ſay that his way was fruitleſs, or that he was <hi>a barren wilderneſs, or a land of drought,</hi> Jer. ii. 31. The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt feckleſs piece of comphance wanted not its
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:030532_0068_0FE7C1DACEA89040"/>reward; Mal. i. 10. <hi>Who is there among you that would ſhut the doors for nought: Neither do ye kindle fire on mine altar for nought.</hi> Thus the Lord's work was power, not force. He drew, but it was <hi>with the cords of love, and bands of a man,</hi> Hoſ. xi. 4. He bid me quit many things, but they were vain things that were no bread, Iſa. lv. 2. <hi>Remember this and ſhew yourſelves men: Bring it again to mind, O ye tranſgreſſors O houſe of Iſrael, are not my ways equal? Are not your ways unequal? Yet ye ſay, the way of the Lord is not equal,</hi> Ezek xviii. 25.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Though it was congruous to reaſon, yet it was a work far above the power of nature. I cannot aſcribe its riſe or progreſs to myſelf; for it was what I ſought not, I thought not of, I liked not, yea, I hated it, I ſeared, I avoided, I ſhifted it; and when all this would not do, I oppoſed it. For I was of thoſe <hi>that rebel againſt the light,</hi> Job xxiv. 13. I cannot aſcribe it to any outward means. There are many parts of it which they did not reach. The moſt feaſible failed; the weakeſt wrought the effect. Neither ſtrong nor weak, had always the like effect. But the work was carried on by a ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcernible power of him who is like <hi>the wind blowing where it liſteth,</hi> John iii. 8. The work bears an impreſs of God in all its ſteps: the word that awakened me, was the voice of him that makes the <hi>dead to hear,</hi> John v. 25. that <hi>calleth things that are not as if they were,</hi> Rom. iv. 17. The light that ſhone, was <hi>the candle of the Lord ſearching,</hi> yea, piercing unto the <hi>hidden parts of the belly,</hi> Frov. xx. 27. tracing a deceitful and unſearchable heart into all its turnings and windings, Jer. xvii. 10. The work was that of one who is every where, and who knows every thing, and <hi>is of one mind,</hi> Job xxiii. 13. and ſo not to be turned; who will not <hi>faint,</hi> nor be <hi>diſcouraged, till he have brought forth judgment unto victory.</hi> The work is uniform, though variouſly carried on, through many interruptions, over many oppoſitions, for a long tract of time, by means ſeemingly weak, improper and contrary, ſuitable only for him whoſe <hi>ways are in the ſea, and whoſe paths are in the great waters, and whoſe footſteps are not known.</hi> In a word, it was <hi>a buſh burning</hi> and <hi>not conſumed,</hi> only by the preſence of God, Exod. iii. 3. It was a ſpark in
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:030532_0069_0FE7C182D1CDF7D8"/>the midſt of an ocean, maintained, notwithſtanding floods continually poured on it to extinguiſh it. This flame was maintained by oil ſecredy conveyed into it, Pſal. cxviii. 23. <hi>This is the doing of the Lord, and it is wondrous it our eyes.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. WHEN I had ſtudied philoſophy three years, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tickled with it, and ſomewhat puffed up with what progreſs I had made, and deſigned and expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make—(though I muſt own that ſtill as knowledge inceraſed, ſelf-conceit decreaſed; and I apprehended I knew more the firſt year than ever I thought I knew af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards) —being thus prepared, I deſigned to go abroad, and improve myſelf further; to which alſo was adviſed. But two things broke this project; my mother would not conſent, and the former exerciſe having brought me into bondage through fear of death, I was afraid to run the hazards I muſt run of my life, ſo long as I was in ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettled
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:030532_0070_0FE7C1DC5D957898"/>a caſe as to my ſoul's ſtate. Wherefore, upon the motion of ſome friends, I conſented rather to engage chaplain to a family for ſome time.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Accordingly, Auguſt 1696, I went to the Weymſs'. When I came here, a ſtranger amongſt ſtrangers, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of conſiderable quality, by my natural baſhfuln ſs, the conſoriouſoefs of my auditors, the publieneſs of the appearances I was obliged to make, to which former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I had not been accuſtomed, my want of breeding, and the like. I was, for a time, in a very great ſtrait, forced to retiredneſs, and to petition for help how to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it: And though it was my own, not the Lord's ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour I deſigned, and was concerned for, yet he that hears the cry of the ravens, Job xxxviii. 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3. During the firſt half year or ſo that I was here, I was ſomewhat diverted from my main work, being obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſtudy what was neceſſary for my accompliſhment for converſe in the world. But ſtill I held on, and the more difficulty I met with, I kept the cloſſer to the form of religion I had taken up. Beſides, now my ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion called and obliged me to ſomewhat more. But leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, which is only introductory, I proceed to that which is mainly and only deſigned in this narrative.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I had not long been here, when I was often neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily, and frequently without ſufficient neceſſity, engaged in debates about the truth of religion, the divinity of the ſcriptures, and the moſt important doctrines delivered in them, whereby I was drawn to read the writings of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, and other enemies to religion, that I might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint with the arguments, whereby thoſe I ſometimes had occaſion to diſpute with, oppoſed the truth. As to the iſſue of thoſe arguings, with reſpect to others, I ſhall here wave it, becauſe others are concerned in it; only I may ſay, I found it true, (Tit. iii. 9.) that <hi>fool<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And <hi>profane and vain bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings do increaſe unto more ungodlineſs.</hi> And to my ſad experience I found, 2 Tim. ii. 17. that <hi>their words doth eat as doth a canker,</hi> or gangrene. It is of an infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and contagious nature; and therefore it is ſafeſt to ſhun, avoid them, and follow the wiſe man's advice, Prov. ix. 6. to <hi>forſake the fooliſh and live;</hi> Prov. xiv. 6. and depart from <hi>a fooliſh man when we perceive not in him the lips of knowledge;</hi> Prov. xix. 27. and <hi>ceaſe from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction that cauſes to err from the words of knowledge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. This was of very dangerous conſequence to me, and could not prove otherwiſe to one in my caſe. For, I. I was not <hi>rooted and grounded in the truth,</hi> Eph. iii. 17. Col. ii. 7. being neither notionally inſtructed in the grounds whereon the ſcripture is received, nor acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed practically with its power, and ſo was naked of that <hi>armour of light,</hi> Rom. xiii. 11. that is neceſſary toward a conflict with ſuch enemies. 2.

Then haſ? the words of eternal life.</hi> The Lord powerfully convinced, and kept the conviction ſtrong on my mind, that at what time I parted with revelation, I behoved to give up with all proſpect of certainty or ſatisfaction about eternal life. What deiſts told me, of the demonſtrations of a future
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:030532_0075_0FE7C18BCB7EEAB8"/>happineſs built only upon nature's light, had no weight with me; becauſe I had tried thoſe long ago, and found them to my apprehention inconcludent: and had they been concludent, I was never a whit the nearer ſatisfaction. To tell me of ſuch a ſtate, without any account of its nature, or the terms whereon it is attainable, was all on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> as if nothing had been ſaid about it: This created ſtill a dread of the concluſion in my mind; and ſtill when I was ſolicited to quit the ſcriptures, I returned, <hi>To whom ſhall I go to find the words of eternal life?</hi> 2. Upon a due obſervation of thoſe who were truly religious, I could not but look on them (though their real worth I did not yet diſcern) as the better part of mankind; and the Lord created a dread in my ſoul of concluſions, that imported the charge of a lie in a matter of the greateſt importance againſt the better part of mankind, Pſal. lxxiii. 15. <hi>If I ſhould ſpeak thus, I would offend againſt the generation of thy children.</hi> 3. The Lord opened mine eyes to ſee the remarkable folly of thoſe who abandoned rovealed reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: Not to mention the impious lives of the generality, I ſaw the ſoberer ſort guilty of unaccountable folly. The ſcripture tells them plainly, that if they have a mind to be ſatisfied as to the truth of theſe pretenſions, they muſt walk in the way of its procepts to find it, John vii. 17. <hi>If any man will do his will, he ſhall know</hi> this <hi>doctrine</hi> if it is <hi>of God,</hi> or if <hi>I ſpeak of myſelf.</hi> But they walk in a direct contradiction to its precepts, and yet complain of the want of evidence, while they refuſe to try that way wherein only it is to be found. Again, ſome ſober and learned, and otherwiſe inquiſitive perſons own, that if we are either cut off from hopen, or left to uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty about a future ſtate of happineſs, we are miſerable: —and that they themſelves are yet uncertain. While af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all this has been by them confeſſed, and by ſome to myſelf, I ſaw them either at little or no pains to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, Prov. xiv. 6. <hi>The ſcorn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now I thought it was not ſafe to ſollow thoſe whom I faw ſo evidently fooliſh, and who
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:030532_0076_0FE7C1EA10172BD0"/>did ſo plainly proclaim their folly, Prov. xxviii. 5. <hi>Evil <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

The ſhining evidence of the power of religion, in the lives, but more eſpecially in the deaths of the martyrs, of whom I had formerly read of, ſtayed me as to this, that there in a reality in religion, when I was beat from all other holds: Heb. xi. 33. <hi>They were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better reſurrection.</hi> Here I beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to own <hi>the finger of God,</hi> eſpecially when I conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their numbers, their quality, and all circumſtances. 5. The known inſtances of the power of religion in chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in their tender years, was of great uſe ſometimes, and appeared of great weight: it checked the force of temptations that drove me to doubt of the reality of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Pſal. viii. 2.

The ſenſible and violent op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition I found Satan making to the ſcriptures in all the fore-mentioned ways, was oft ſtaying, and perſuaded me in ſome meaſure, that there behoved to be a reality in religion; und I could not ſee what could induce him thus to oppoſe it, if it were a cheat, Matth. xii. 26. <hi>Is Satan divided?</hi> 7. I got frequent touches in a way of convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Heb. iv. 12. and thus ſinding the power and piercing virtue of the word, making <hi>manifeſt the ſecrets of my heart, I was forced to fall down and own God to be in it of a truth,</hi> 1 Cor. xiv. 25.8. Satan ſometimes <hi>departed</hi> and left me <hi>for a ſeaſon,</hi> Luke iv. 13 and then I had ſome intermiſſion of my ſore trouble. 9. I found a ſecret hope begot and cheriſhed, I could not tell how, at ſome ſeaſons, even amidſt the violence of temptations, that I ſhould be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, <hi>and that I ſhould yet have good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="78" facs="unknown:030532_0077_0FE7C19179FB46E8"/>any had been ſo moleſted as I, and if there was <hi>any ſorrow like unto mine,</hi> Lam. i. 12. Yea, ſometimes I was made to hope that Satan's raging foreboded that his <hi>time</hi> was but <hi>ſhort,</hi> Rev. xii. 12.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. As by theſe and the like means, the force of the temptation was ſomewhat broken, ſo I was encouraged to ſeveral things, which I have reaſon to own God was kind to me in holding me to them—1. Hereby I was engaged to hold on, in an attendance with more concern in duties of religion, public, private, and ſecret; and ſo to wait at wiſdom's door poſt, Prov. viii. 34. which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards I found the advantage of. 2. Hereby I was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabled to conceal all my own ſtraits from others, who thereby might either have been ſtumbled or hardened in their evil way: I was unwilling others ſhould know any thing that might diſguſt them at religion, 2 Sam. i. 22. <hi>Tell it not in Gath, —leſt the daughters of the uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed triumph.</hi> In converſe with ſuch as were ſhaken, I ſtill endeavoured to ſtand for the truth, as if I had been under no doubt about it; and I muſt own, that while I did ſo, the Lord often countenanced me, and ſatisſied me as to what I had formerly been diſquieted about: <hi>How good a maſter is God!</hi> A word ſpoken for him is not loſt; not will he ſuffer the leaſt ſervice to paſs unreward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: A heathen Cyrus muſt have his hire; and ſo muſt Nebuchadnezzar, Ezek. xxix. 19.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Before I leave this, I muſt obſerve ſome things which the Lord taught me by this exerciſe. 1. I here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by learned the danger and vanity of reaſoning with Satan: When I began to anſwer him with my own reaſonings, he had ſtill great advantage, 1 Pet. v. 9.; he eaſily evad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all my arguments, and eaſily repelled my anſwers, and enforced his ſuggeſtions, James iv. 7.3. and when his ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions were to be maintained in point of arguments, he injected them with that impudent violence that I was not able to ſtand againſt, Matth. iv. 10, 11. Our ſafeſt courſe is to <hi>reſiſt,</hi> and to hold at a diſtance, to avoid communing with him, Jude 9. 2. I muſt obſerve like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the wiſe providence of God: that the greateſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties that lie againſt religion are hid from atheiſts. All the objections I met with in their writings, were not near
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:030532_0078_0FE7C1EB9E97F478"/>ſo ſubtile, as thoſe which were often ſuggeſted to me: The reaſon of it, from the nature of the thing, is obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; ſuch perſons take not a near-hand view of religion; and while perſons ſtand at a diſtance, neither are the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties that attend it, nor the advantages of it, diſcerned. Again, Satan finding all things quiet with them, keeps all ſo; and finding that they are enſnared, he uſes not force, Lake xi. 21. It is where he is in danger of loſing a perſon, that he uſes his utmoſt efforts: when Chriſt is ready to caſt him out, then he rages and tears poor ſouls, Matth. ix. 29. Beſides, the Lord in his infinite wiſdom permits not all theſe helliſh ſubtilities to be publiſhed, in tenderneſs to the ſaith of the weak. He that ſets bounds to the raging of the ſea, and ſays, <hi>Hitherto ſhalt thou come, and hore ſhall thy proud waves be ſtayed.</hi> Job xxxviii. 11. keeps Satan under chains, and he cannot ſtep beyond his permiſſion, Rev. xx. 1.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. This exerciſe had ſundry effects upon me—1. The fears I was brought under fixed a deeper ſenſe of my frailty in general on me, and that I was but a man, Pſal. ix. 20. <hi>Put them in fear, that the nations may know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be but men. Selab.</hi> 2. Hereby the Lord with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held me from my vain projects about learning. Now I was ſo far from expecting, as ſome time I had done, that I feared I ſhould fall ſhort of what was abſolutely needful to my own well being, Eccl. vii. 23. <hi>I ſaid I will be wiſe, but it was far from me.</hi> 3. Whereas I was educate with an eye to the miniſtry, and aimed that way; now I came to ſee the difficulty, and repent my raſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions; and laid down a reſolution to look no more that way, unleſs the Lord ſatisfied me fully about thoſe truths whereof I now doubted. I could not without hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror think of ſpeaking to others what I believed not my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, 2 Cor. iv. 13. 4. My bondage <hi>through fear of death</hi> was increaſed, and grew ſtronger, Heb. ii. 15.5. I was urged to ſomewhat of more cloſeneſs in the performance of duty; though often I was urged to give it over as vain, yet I ſtill reſolved to hold on there. 6. I was ſtill more and more confirmed in the neceſſity of further evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for the truth of religion, than I either had attained or knew how to attain.</p>

After I had thus-wearied myſelf, after the edge and violence of the temptations above mentioned was, by the formerly narrated conſiderations, blunted and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what broke rather than removed, and I eaſed by Satan's departure for a ſeaſon, I inclined to reſt; and Satan hereon finding matters prepared for an aſſanlt, made freſh attempts in another, and no leſs diſquieting manner: Matth. vii. 12, 43, 44. <q>When the unclean ſpirit is gone our of a he walketh through dry places ſeeking reſt and finding none. Then he ſaith, I will return to my houſe from whence I came out; and when he cometh, he findeth it empty, ſwept and garniſhed.

                  </p>
                  <p>The devil cannot be at reſt, where he hath no miſchief to do to men. The devil ſo leaveth none but he will be attempting to come unto them again; and he ordinarily ſucceedeth, where Chriſt hath not prepoſſeſſed the ſoul: All other reformation proves bot a ſweeping and a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, while the ſoul is empty of Chriſt. It may be ſwept from the filth of flagitious ſins, and garniſhed with the paint of religion, or ſome habits of moral virtue: But none of theſe will keep out the devil. Thus I found it to my coſt: For, 1. Satan finding my ſoul, after all my ſad toſſings, empty of Chriſt, returned. 2. And my ſoul being like the <hi>vineyard of the ſluggard,</hi> Prov. xxiv. 31. by ſloth, detence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, without its ſtone wall, he eaſily found opportunity to ſow tares, and while I ſlept, to cultivate the thorns and net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which naturally grow there. 3.

This was Adam's way—<hi>The woman thou gaveſt me to be with me, ſhe gave me and I did eat,</hi> Gen. iii. 12.2. Sometimes after my engagements and vows, and breaches of them, when I found conſcience diſturb me, I begun to enquire whether the things were ſin, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to perſuade myſelf, that ſome which were moſt diſturbing were not, Prov. xx. 25. Thus, <hi>after vows I made enquiry.</hi> 3. I, at laſt, when all theſe cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes failed, again ſaid, I will not tranſgreſs; and I made new vows and roſolutions, accompanied with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for my former breaches, and ſolemnly bound my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt my ſins, thoſe that predomined; Exod. x. 16.17. <hi>Then Pharaoh called for Moſes and Aaron in haſte, and ſaid, I have ſinned againſt the Lord your God, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you.

I took to ſmother convictions, were not able to procure me peace, but really increaſed my inward diſquietment, and waſted my ſpirit, Pſal. xxxiii. 3. <hi>When I kept ſilence</hi> (that is, when I ſinfully endeavoured to ſuppreſs my guilt and trouble) <hi>my bones waxed old, through my roaring all day long.</hi> 3. The Lord in mercy gave me no reſt in any of theſe inventions, but ſuffered me to weary myſelf in ſeeking my lovers, that I might at length betake myſelf to him. For ſo long as I followed theſe ways. <hi>Day and night his hand lay heavy upon me: My moiſture was turned into the drought of ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> Pſal. xxxii. 4.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. Though hitherto I failed of a right iſſue, yet I was carried a great length in compliance with convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

Sometimes, through the force of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, I was indeed brought for ſome time to aim at getting my mind fixed upon heavenly things, and kept on the thoughts of them: But my heart being yet carnal, I wearied of this hent, and of this forcible religion.

                  <p n="7">7. The firſt diſcernible effect of this diſcovery was, an approbation of God's way of ſaving ſinners by Jeſus Chriſt, to the praiſe of the glory of his grace, which I take to be the true ſcriptural notion of juſtifying faith; for this not only anſwers the ſcripture deſcriptions of it, by <hi>receiving, coming to him, leaking to him, truſting and believing in him,</hi> &amp;c. John i. 12. Matth. xi. 25. Heb. xii. 2. Pſal. ix. 10.; but it really gives him <hi>that glory,</hi> Rom. iv. 20 that be deſigned by all this contrivance, —the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his wiſdom, grace, mercy, and truth. Now this diſcovery of the Lord's name brought me to truth in him, and glory only in the Lord: I found my ſoul fully ſatis. fied in theſe diſcoveries, as pointing out a way of relief, altogether, and in all reſpects, ſuitable to the need of a poor, guilty, ſelf condemned, ſelf-deſtroyed ſinner, beat from all other reliefs, and who has his mouth ſtepped before God, after he has ſpent all his ſubſtance to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon other phyſicians, Mark v. 26. In this I reſted, as a way full of peace, comfort, ſecurity, and ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as providing abundantly for all thoſe ends I deſired to have ſecured. And this approbation was not mercly for a fit, but over after in all temptations it diſcovered itſelf—1. By keeping me up in a fixed aſſent, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence of mind to, and perſuaſion of this truth, <hi>That God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is only in his Son,</hi> 1 John v. 11. 2. When afterwards I was, under temptations, ſolicited to go away and ſeek relief in other ways, it ſtill kept me conſtant in a firm reſolute rejection of all other ways of relief, and renunciation of all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals that led to them, even when I found not the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent comfort of this way; I ever held at that with <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim,

                  <p n="9">9. The evidence of this <hi>change</hi> was for ſome time fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently darkened; by which I found, whenever I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, by the prevalency of ſin, challenges thence ariſing, or the Lord's hiding, brought under any ſears of my own ſalvation, then my thoughts were nigroſſed, and as it were wholly and only taken up about my own ſafety, and my concern for the Lord's glory not then appearing, I was there by caſt under fears that I was altogether ſelfiſh; but
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:030532_0094_0FE7C209CDC567E8"/>the Lord at length cleared up this caſe unto me. Our minds are weak, they have many concerns, ſome where of they value more, ſome leſs: they cannot, through their weakneſs and limited nature, be intent in their thoughts about all, or even many of them, at once. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when any one, though the leaſt of them, is in hazard, their care muſt be taken up mainly, and as it were about that only, Lake xv. 4. I ven the good ſhepherd, though really he vajues the ninety and nice more than the are reſt, and employ all his thoughts as it were about that: But when all are equally ſafe, and none of our concerns are in any viſible hazard, then is the only proper time to judge what is really uppermoſt in the ſoul; that which it then is moſt frequently with, delights moſt in, and can leaſt think of patting with, that is uppermoſt. That which has <hi>the heart</hi> is the <hi>treaſure,</hi> Matth. vi. 21. And the Lord let me ſee that my ſoul was, when all was ſafe, wholly almoſt taken up in viewing with delight the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations of his glory in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Before I proceed to take notice of any other ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of this diſcovery, I ſhall repreſent in a ſew particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, the pleaſant way where by the Lord carried on this change as to the chief end—I. When the Lord came to work this change, I was funk under the weighing ſenſe of this, that I had <hi>deſtroyed myſelf,</hi> Hoſ. xiii. 6. and deeply concerned to know how I might be ſaved, <hi>ibid.</hi> Iſa. xlv. 24.2. The Lord made me firſt lock up, by a diſcovery of ſalvation and help which anſwered my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern about my own caſe. 3. When I looked to this ſalvation, I found <hi>it in him.</hi> 4. When by this means I came to ſee his glory ſhining in the continvance of my ſalvation, by the luſtre of it I was affected ſo, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to value it above all things, and look on it as of that importance, that, provided it were ſecured, <hi>all other things,</hi> the higheſt concerns of the creatures not except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were of ſmall moment, Phil. i.: 9. And, 5. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in viewing the glory of his goodneſs, in ordering it ſo, that the creatures in aiming at his glory ſhould fird their own ſalvation; this endeared the Lord and his ways ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly. Thus the Lord ſweetly led me, by a view of
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:030532_0095_0FE7C1B0552905D0"/>help ſuited to my caſe, to a diſcovery of his glory in my ſalvation; and helped me to place things, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, at leaſt in wiſh and deſign, in their own order, and give his glory the pre eininency that was its due. But this only by the bye. Now I go on.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. A third diſcernible effect of this diſcovery was, with reſpect unto the Lord's yoke, his precepts, 2 Cor. iii. 18. beholding his glory, I was changed into his image, and made to look on his <hi>yake</hi> as <hi>eaſy,</hi> and his <hi>burden</hi> as <hi>light,</hi> Matth. xi. 30. and to count that <hi>his commaniments</hi> were <hi>not grievous</hi> 1 John v. 3. but <hi>right concerning all things,</hi> Pſal. cxix. 128. This was very far contrary to my former temper. Now the reality of this change ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated and evidenced itſelf, even amidſt all temptations, ſlips, yea, and relapſes into the ſatare ſin, ſeveral ways— 1. I now came to a fixed perſuaſion, that the law was not only <hi>juſt</hi> ſuch againſt which I could make no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable exception; but <hi>holy,</hi> ſuch as became God; and <hi>good,</hi> Rom. vii. 12. ſuch as every way was ſuhed to my true intereſt, and peace, and advantage, which I could never think before. 2.

And if the Lord would have given me it in my choice, to have the laws that croſſed them razed, or to let them ſtand, he knows I would have thought the law leſs pleaſant, leſs perfect, if theſe had been wanting, Phil. iii. 7. Thus <hi>what things were gain, 1 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>w counted dung,</hi> and endeavoured to <hi>keep myſelf from mine iniquity,</hi> Pſal. xviii. 23. and I could never think myſelf happy till theſe were <hi>plucked</hi> out, which were before as <hi>the right eye,</hi> Matth. v. 29, 30.6. I took delight in others, or in myſelf, only in ſo far as there appeared any thing of a ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denied, humble conformity to the law of the Lord, ſuch I counted as the <hi>excellent of the earth,</hi> Pſal. xvi. 2, 3. and I was glad when I got near them in any the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt inſtance. 7. My ſoul frequently ſpent itſelf in ſuch breathings after conformity to the law of God, as the cxixth Pſalm is filled with throughout, Pſal. cxix. 5, 20, 33, 112. <hi>O that my ways were directed to keep thy ſtatutes. My heart breaketh, through the longing it hath to thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands at all times. Incline my heart that I may keep them always unto the end,</hi>—and the like. 8. This appeared fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in a fixed diſlike of the leaſt inconformity to the law, either in myſelf or others. Now, albeit I was not always ſuitably affected with my own or other's breach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, yet this was my burden. I wiſhed always that <hi>rivers of tears</hi> might <hi>run down my eyes, becauſe</hi> I or other tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors <hi>kept not God's law,</hi> Pſal. cxix. 136.9. Even when ſin prevailed, and I was afraid to be ruined, when that <hi>which was ordained for life</hi> oroved <hi>death</hi> to me, even then my liking to the law, and value for conformity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, all this notwithſtanding I conſented to the <hi>law,</hi> that it was <hi>holy, juſt, and good,</hi> Rom. vii. 10, 16.10. The ſins which, through the force of temptation, I frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relapſed into, yet were, and I durſt appeal to the ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of hearts as to the truth of this, what <hi>I would not</hi> do: That is, what the conſtant <hi>bent of my will</hi> (when not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>immediate force of a temptation,</hi> Rom. vii. 12. when I was not myſelf) was ſet againſt. II. Now nothing
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:030532_0097_0FE7C1B6B2196C98"/>appeared more ſatisfactory in heaven, than a proſpect of being there <hi>ſatisfied with his likeneſs,</hi> Pſal. xvii. 5.12. I looked on the remainder of ſin, as my greateſt miſery and burden, and that which made me truly a <hi>wretched man,</hi> Rom. vii. 24. and daily cry for deliverance. In aword, I ſaw that if I could reach conformity to God's law, I would have pleaſure, and peace, and liberty, Prov. iii. 17. All wiſdom's ways are ways of <hi>peace, her paths pleaſantneſs, her commendments not grievous,</hi> I John v. 3. her yoke light, and nothing uneaſy, but that remaining enſeb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dned corruption, that would not hoop to put its neck un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the yoke, Matth, xi. 29, 30. This effect was the moſt diſcernible of any, under temptations, and has ſtood me in the beſt ſtead.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. A fourth diſcernible effect of this diſcovery, was the exerciſe of evangelical repentance, which was very different in many reſpects from that ſorrow I before was acquainted with. 1. In its riſe: ſorrow formerly flowed from diſcoveries of ſin, as it brings on wrath, now it flowed from a ſenſe of ſin, as containing wretched un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs to one, who was aſtoniſhingly kind to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy wretch. I looked upon him <hi>whom I had pierced, and mourned,</hi> Zech. xii 10. O! what an unkind wretch am I, to provoke ſuch a God, who has followed me with ſo much mercy, and yet offers kindneſs? 3. <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> formerly <hi>wrought death,</hi> 2 Cor. vi. 10. alienated my heart from God, and ſo diſpirited for duty, and made me fear hurt from him: But this ſorrow filled my heart with kindneſs to God, to his way, ſweetened my ſoul, and endeared God to it. It flowed from a ſenſen of his favour, to an unworthy wretch that deſerved none, and was thus a godly ſorrow leading to kindneſs to God, drawing near to him, but with much humble ſenſe of my own unworthineſs, like the returning prodigal, when he ſaw his father coming to meet him, Luke xv. 20, 21.2. The more God manifeſted of his kindneſs, the more this ſtill increaſed; when he was pacified, I was aſhamed and confounded, Ezek. xvi. 63. <hi>After I was turned I repented, I ſmote noon my breaſt, and was aſhamed and confounded</hi> for my ſtrayings, Jer. i. 9. The ſorrow I had before I looked on as a burden, it was nothing but ſeld<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſh concern for my own ſafety, and a fear of being
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:030532_0098_0FE7C210F2F063D8"/>made to ſeel the effects of a righteous reſentment of God. But this ſorrow was ſweet and pleaſant, as being the exerciſe of filial gratitude, and I took pleaſure in the ſurpriſing manifeſtations of God's favour to one ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, and in acknowledging my own unworthineſs, Pſal. lxxiii. 22, 23. A ſenſe of my ingratitude, when kept within, covered me with bluſhes, and I was eaſed when the Lord allowed me to vent my ſenſe of it, and pour it as it were in his boſom. 5. This ſorrow was a ſpring of activity in the way of duty; and I was glad to be employed in the meaneſt errand that might give opportunity to evidence how deeply I reſented my former diſobedience, Luke xv. 19. <hi>Make me as one of thy hired ſervants.</hi> 6. In a word, it had all the marks, in ſome meaſure, which the apoſtle gives of the exerciſe of this grace. It was a <hi>godly ſorrow,</hi> coming from God, it led to God, as always what comes from him in a way of grace, leads to him in a way of duty. <hi>It wrought re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance unto life not to be repented of,</hi> 2 Cor. vi. 10. it iſſued in a return to the way of life, and to ſuch a courſe, as upon a review I did not repent of, but delighted in, and defired to be carried further on in. And ſtill in as far as this ſorrow obtained, there was a livelineſs in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing this way, that leads to ſalvation or life. It wrought carefulneſs to avoid ſin, and pleaſe God, indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin, fear of offending God again, vehement deſire of having ſin removed, the Lord glorified, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence promoted: It wrought zeal for God, and revenge againſt myſelf and ſin. It was not as former ſorrow, preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with pride, ſtiffneſs, and unwillingneſs to undergo any chaſtiſement; but it humbled, ſoftened the ſoul, and wrought a willingneſs to bear the indignation of the Lord when I had ſinned againſt him. In a word, I was glad when the Lord allowed me any meaſure of it, and griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when I found it wanting, and cried to the Prince ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted for it, becauſe of the good effects it had, and the real advantage I found by it, with reſpect unto the whole of that obedience the Lord requires.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. A fifth diſcernible effect of this diſcovery was, a humble, but ſweet and comfortable hope, and perſuaſion of my own ſalvation, anſwerable to the clearneſs of this diſcovery; that is, riſing in ſtrength, or growing more
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:030532_0099_0FE7C35BC09CA590"/>weak, and leſs diſcernible, as the diſcoveries of the way of ſalvation were more or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap> clear und ſtrong. New becauſe this is what I take for goſpel aſſurance, with the worthy Dr. Owen, I ſhall give ſome further account of it, as I found it then and ſince.—I. When the Lord gave this diſcovery of his way of ſalvation, he ſatisfied me, that it was a way full of peace and ſecurity, the only ſafe way whereon I might ſafely venture; and hereby, as I told formerly, I was ſully perſuaded, <hi>That this was the way wherein I ſhould walk,</hi> Iſa. xxx. 21. Hereby I was tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed from that diſquieting ſear, that in truſting to it, I was truſting to that which would fail. I was ſatisfied, I could not fail otherwiſe than by miſſing this way; I doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of myſelf, but not of the way. 2. The Lord, by the diſcovery above mentioned, did powerfully draw my ſoul to cloſe with it; and in ſo far as I have to, and cloſed with this, in ſo far, conſidering the former diſcovery of the ſafety of this way, I could not doubt of the iſſue, but was ſweetly ſatisfied, that my <hi>expectation ſhould not be cut off,</hi> Prov. xxiii. 18. nor my labour in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ain in purſuing this courſe. While I clave to, and repoſed with ſatisfaction on what I was convinced was ſafe, I could not, in ſo far as I leaned to this, but be quiet and compoſed about the iſſue. Which ſhews how nearly allied faith and aſſurance are, though they are not the ſame, and therefore no wonder the one ſhould be taken for the other. 3. Hereby I was animated to walk on in this way, and follow duty; and finding, as I went on in duty, that ſo far as I proceeded, my expectation was not diſappointed, ſtill according to ſucceſs, this hope inſenſibly and ſecretly grew. This God <hi>is our God, we have waited for him, and he will ſave us,</hi> Iſa. xxv. 9.4. This diſcovery manifeſting ſalvation in a way of ſelf denial, and truſt only in the Lord, nothing ſo ſoon marred this hope, as the leaſt appearance of ſelf, and ſtirring of pride. Whenever the glory of the Lord was revealed, and he ſpake peace, I was hereon filled with ſhame, and the decper this humiliation was, ſtill the humble confidence of my ſafety increaſed, Ezek. xvi. 63. Now theſe two laſt remarks ſhew, how far this aſſurance is from any conſiſtency with negligence, much leſs does it foſter it: For it grows only upon adherence to the Lord's
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:030532_0100_0FE7C24D53695C40"/>way, and is ſtrengthened by a ſucceſsful purſuit of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Lord's way. To intermit or neglect duty, razes the foundation, or at leaſt, lays an unſurmountable ſtop in the way of its progreſs and growth. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is widely differenced from that unaſſaulted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence ſome pretend to, which is a fruit of pride, and foſters it, as the laſt remark clears. In a word, the caſe is plainly thus: This way the Lord diſcovers, is ſafe for a ſelf-condemned ſinner. I am ſate in a practical adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to it. The further I go, and the cloſer I in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice cleave to this way, hope of this ſalvation increaſes the more. Here no place for ſloth, but a ſpur to dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, as what will not be in vain in the iſſue, and is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the comfort in every ſtep, as carrying ſtill nearer the deſired ſalvation. And this ſafery ariſing from a renunciation of all confidence in the fleſh, and a truſt only in the ſovereign grace of God through Chriſt, there is no place for confidence in ourſelves, or pride in any degree, the leaſt degree of pride being a ſtep out of this way of peace and ſafety.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. A ſixth diſcernible difference, was with reſpect to the ordinances of the Lord's appointment, Pſal. xxvi. 4. This diſcovery, 1.

It made me follow after diſcoveries of the Lord's glory in them, and diſcoveries from him of myſelf, my caſe, my ſin, my duty. I deſired to behold the <hi>beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in his temple,</hi> ibid. 3. It put me to the Lord to ſeek theſe diſcoveries from him, and to pray with reſpect both to myſelf and thoſe concerned in the diſpenſation of the goſpel; <hi>one thing have I deſired of the Lord,</hi> ibid.

When the Lord enlarged and cauſed me to approach to him, and ſee his glory, he ſtill humbled me, dicovered ſelf, and put me in oppoſition to it: I have ſeen him, and therefore I loathed myſelf, Job xlii. 5, 6.6.

                  <p n="3">3. This diſcovery, while it laſted, was full of raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſweetneſs, and many things contributed very much to make it ſo—I. The caſe wherein it found me: I was
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:030532_0104_0FE7C2568024B288"/>condemned by God, by my <hi>own conſcience,</hi> and was like to ſink under the preſſure of the fear of a preſent execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſentence: When the uſual labours of the day required that I ſhould ſleep, and my body toiled and waſted with the diſquiet of my mind, made me heavy, and urged it more; yet I was afraid to cloſe mine eyes, leſt I ſhould awaken in hell, and durſt not let myſelf ſleep, till I was by a weary body beguiled into it, leſt I ſhould drop into the pit before I was aware, Eccl. v. 12. Was it any wonder that the news of pardon and forgiveneſs were ſweet to one in ſuch a caſe? whereby I was made to lie down in ſafety, and take quiet reſt, while there was <hi>none</hi> to <hi>make</hi> me <hi>afraid,</hi> Micah iv. 4. <hi>For ſo giveth he his beloved ſleep,</hi> Pſal. cxxvi. 2. A little before I was like Jonah in the whale's belly, Jonah ii. 5, 6, 7. <hi>The waters compaſſed me about even to the ſoul; the deep cloſed me round about, the weeds were wrapt about my head, I went down to the bottom of the mountains, the earth with her bars was about me for ever.</hi> Ver. 4. <hi>And I ſaid, I am caſt out of God's ſight.</hi> Now, was it any wonder that ſuch an one was delighted when brought into a garden of delights, placed out of all view of trouble, ſave a reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on it as paſt, which is retreſhing, and ſet down, to ſun himſelf, and dry himſelf under the refreſhing rays of the Sun of righteouſneſs? 2. The things that the Lord diſcovered, were in themſelves glorious, the glory of the Lord ſhone about me: I ſaw ſuch things as <hi>eye hath not ſeen, beſides thee, O God,</hi> Iſa. lxiv. 4. <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time, the only begotten of the Father, he hath declared him,</hi> John i. 18.

They were new things wherewithal I was utterly unacquaint before, and this made them the more affecting, Iſa, lii. 15. <hi>He ſhall ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle many nations, the kings ſhall ſhut their mouths at him: For that which had not beem told them ſhall they ſee, and that which they had not heard ſhall they confider.</hi> Prov. xxv. 26. <hi>As cold waters to a thirſty ſoul, ſo is good news from a far country.</hi> Again, 4. The light wherein theſe things were diſcovered, was a clear ſparkling light, that

As to ſin, there was a great odds; though I could not delight in duty as before, I abhorred thoughts of delighting in ſin: I was ſometimes by the power of temptation driven to conſent, to its embraces, but that was juſt ſuch a forced conſent, as by the power of conviction I before gave to the law; whenever I was at myſelf, I retracted it; <hi>my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentings</hi> were <hi>kindled</hi> within me, Hoſ. xi. 8.

                  <p n="1">1. I Had not been long in this pleaſant caſe before I found my miſtake, that enemies were not foiled, and that I muſt down into the valley, and <hi>wreſtle with principalities,</hi> and <hi>powers,</hi> Eph. vi. 12. and fight with no leſs enemies than the Anakims. My corruptions, ſelf,
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:030532_0112_0FE7C26443E75FD8"/>paſſion, &amp;c. and eſpecially thoſe <hi>ſins which caſily beſet me,</hi> Heb. xii. 1. which formerly I was ſo careful to have ſpared, and which I refuſed to deliver up to juſtice, ſet upon me. And finding that I was now no more their's, as formerly, they gave me frequent ſcils: I fell before them often, and multiplied relapſes, Rom. vii. 21, x9. <hi>When I would do good, evil was preſent with me,</hi> and the <hi>good I would do,</hi> through their power, I did not, and <hi>the evil I would not do, that I did.</hi> Thus I learned, that the difference betwixt the Lord's people and others, is not ſimply in this, that the one falls and the other ſtands, but that there is a difference in the iſſue, Prov. xxiv. 16. <hi>The juſt man falleth ſeven times, but the wicked ſhall fall into miſchief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Now though I was unwilling to fight, I drew to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour upon the appearance of theſe enemies, who receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed great advantage by that ſecurity wherein I had fallen. And before I was aware, they received a great advantage I could not eaſily get from them again. But however, ſince fight I muſt, I tried what weapons would be moſt ſucceſsful, Judges xi. 35. And, 1. I objected to them, that now I had no more to do with them: I had enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the Lord, Iſa, xxvi. 13.2. I eſſayed to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt them, as Joſeph did, but without his faith, <hi>Shall I do this great evil, and ſin againſt God?</hi> Gen. xxxix. 9.3. When they ſtill perſiſted, I eſſayed to flee from them, and avoid the occaſions: But the enemy was in my boſom, Prov. iv. 14, 15.4. I prayed againſt them, that the Lord would <hi>rebuke</hi> them, Zech. iii. 2.5. I complained of them as his enemies, Hab. i. 1.6. I proteſted aginſt them, Rom. vii. 20. And many other ways did I try.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But after all they perſiſted, and I was often ſoiled; and hereon I fell into grievous diſcouragement. And, 1. I began to doubt if I was ſincere, or if the Lord was really with me: <hi>If the Lord be us, why is all this evil came upon us?</hi> Judges vi. 13.2. I began to doubt of the iſſue, and conclude, I ſhould <hi>one day periſh</hi> by their <hi>band</hi> 1 Sam. xxvii. 1.3. My conſcience being defiled, I was damped, and could not look up to God. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole, I was in very great diſtreſs, oft at giving over, Pſal. xl. 12.</p>

4. Though I oft ſearched at the time, I could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover whence it was that I ſailed, Pſal. lxxvii. 6. For no mean that I thought of then, almoſt, I leſt uneſſayed. But ſince, ſeveral reaſons of the prevalency of ſin, and the unſucceſsfulneſs of my attempts againſt it, has the Lord graciouſly diſcovered, though I am far from think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to hit them all, or pretending to remember even all that the Lord hath diſcovered; yet ſome of them I ſhall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that now occur: 1. I was in the entry of this war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare too confident in grace already received, laid too much ſtreſs on it, and promiſed too much on my own hand, like Peter, Matth. xxvi. 33. and so wonder I met with his fate, and was leſt to make diſcoveries of my own weakneſs. 2. The ſubtile enemies I had to do with, took <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>e betwixt the ſtraits, and I was not watchful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, nor aware of the ſeaſons when they had ſpecial advantage. The thief knew his time, when the good man is from home, and all is quiet, Matth. xxiv. 43. And I did not watch; and therefore <hi>be came in an hour</hi> when I looked not for him. 3. Mine enemies put me upon vain work, where the ſin lay, not in the thing itſelt, but in the degree of it, there my ſubtile enemies put me on to appear againſt, and ſeek to eradicate what was really in itſelf lawful. Of this I had many inſtances with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to paſſions, and worldly employments, and converſe with ſinful people: I minded not, that if we were boand altogether up from converſe with the <hi>idolaters, fornicators,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of this world, we muſt needs go cat of the world,</hi> 1 Cor. v. 10. And as there was an anger to be avoided, ſo there was an anger that was allowable, and even duty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired that we ſhould be <hi>angry,</hi> Eph. iv. 26. but ſo as <hi>avoid ſin,</hi> Eccl. vii. 9. Thus Satan tempted me to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God, by aiming at things which were neither given of God, nor had I any reaſon to expect them, and thus to tempt God, by ſeeking <hi>ſtones to be made bread,</hi> Matth. iv. 3. or things not meet to be done: Like the Stoicks, I was not content to have the paſſions kept in their own order, but would have them eradicated. Thus the devil drives to extremes, and when we fail of ſucceſs, he takes thence occaſion to diſcourage <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s. Again, 4. I ſtill neglected ſome means of God's appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:030532_0114_0FE7C2696A71A578"/>under pretence of inconveniences and difficulties, and ſometimes becauſe irkſome to the fleſh; whereas theſe were oft-times the only proper means, that were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, or at leaſt the principal in that caſe. The omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of one thing ruins much, and our apologies and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſes will not do, 1 Sam. xiii. 13, 15, 20, 22. Some particular ſins require particular remedies: When God has appointed the uſe of theſe, and this is omitted, no wonder all others fail. When the diſciples aſked, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could not caſt the devil out? our Lord told them, there were <hi>ſome kinds</hi> that went not out <hi>but by faſting and prayer,</hi> Mark ix. 28.29. Whenever any mean is appointed by God, when the caſe occurs wherein it is requiſite, the remedy of God's appointment muſt be uſed, as we would reach the end. If there are ſuppoſed or real difficulties, yet while theſe difficulties are not our ſin, we have reaſon to truſt him as to theſe, and try the means. 5.

Above all, I was little acquaint with the way of ſaith's improvement of Chriſt for ſanctification, and a trade with the throne of grace for ſupplies to help in time of need, John v. 40.7. I was ſometimes not ſingle in my aims; I deſigned to have a victory that would eaſe me of the trouble of watchfulneſs. I was weary of a ſighting life, and would have been at caſe, and had too much of an eye unto this, and ſuch like aims; and, belike, if I got leave to reſt.

                  <p n="5">5. Yet notwithſtanding all theſe dreadful miſcarriages on my part, the Lord, in the heat of this conflict, and even while I was many ways faulty, was very kind: 1. He

The Lord ſometimes ſtepped in when I was overcome, and ſent as it were an <hi>Abigail,</hi> to keep me from executing my wicked purpoſes, 1 Sam. xxv. 32. ſometimes be gave me a cleanly victory, and ſtrengthened me to repel temptations: And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other ways did he help and <hi>deliver,</hi> Pſal. cvi. 43.4. He ſometimes, and even very frequently, when I was hard put to it, cleared up my ſincerity, and gave me ſuch views of it, as emboldened me to appeal to him, which freed me from that temptation, and leſt me at liberty under the advantage of this new encouragement, to appoſe more vigorouſly; Pſal. cxxxix. 21, 22. <hi>Do not I hate all them that hate thee?

Theſe, and many other ways, was the Lord kind in the conflict: He frequently ſaid to me, fear not; <hi>Surely there is an end, and thine expectation ſhall not be cut off,</hi> Prov. xxiii. 18. xxiv. 14.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Lord has ſince let me ſee what gracious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns he carried on by this trial, and what need there was of it, in order both to his glory and my good:— 1.

<pb n="117" facs="unknown:030532_0116_0FE7C26B8EB98FD0"/>that therefore our ſecurity with reſpect to future tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is not in grace already received, but in this, that there is enough in the promiſe, and the way patent <hi>to the thro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He led me hereby to diſcern ſomewhat more of the covenant of grace, that in it there are no promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es made of abſolute freedom from ſin while we are here; 1 John i. 8. <hi>If any man ſay, he has no ſin, he is a liar:</hi> And that we have no promiſe of freedom from groſs ſins, and thoſe ſins wherein we have been formerly entangled, but in the uſe, and diligent uſe, of the means of the Lord's appointment. 2 Pet. i. 8. <hi>If theſe things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye ſhall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> 5.

But where there is a diſtruſt of ſelf, with an eye to the Lord, it is very far otherwiſe. 6. He hereby taught me the uſe and neceſſity, and glory of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion that is made by the covenant of grace for guilt; it writes all to us to diſſuade from, and enable us againſt ſin; <hi>but if any man ſin,</hi> through the power of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it lets us ſee <hi>an advocate with the Father, and blood that cleanſeth from all ſin,</hi> I John iii. 3.7.

Whereas before, when I was lying ſelf-condemned, guilty, and my mouth ſtepped, I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times could ſcarce look up, or give a ſigh or a groan, now I flowed in tears. 10.

                  <p n="11">11. To prevent miſtakes, I ſhall ſubjoin a ſew chſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations concerning this exerciſe. 1.

                     </gap>ther ſeaſons, all this was done, as it were at once, and in a moment. The Lord, as he did to David, in one breathing ſpeaking ſin and <hi>peace,</hi> Sam. xii. 7, 13.2.

But whenever God did tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly rècover from any grievous fall, all theſe things in ſubſtance were found, Iſa. xxviii. 27.3. This was

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ed with them and thereby was more deeply exerciſed and ſought more after distinct diſcoveries of forgiveneſs, which were attended with all theſe pleaſant effects; ſince that the Lord in ſome meaſure broke theſe luſts, I have been aſſaulted with leſs diſcernible evils, ſins under the maſk of duties, and theſe ſecretly devour my ſtrength, and rarely and difficultly are they diſcovered in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſinfulneſs, and ſo when it is much needed, I am more a dranger to that ſtate of repentance. But as I ſee I need it, ſo the Lord knows I long to be brought into it, and to be humbled, eſpecially for ſecret and hidden ſins that waſted the ſtrength. Oft have I been made to think of this, that all the excuſes mentioned in the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the ſupper, that kept them that were invited from cloſing with the offer, were taken from occaſions in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves lawful, Matth. xxii. 5. And no doubt, the excuſes whereby the Lord's own people are kept from that near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that it is their duty and intereſt to ſeek after, flow from the ſame things: I have found them far the more dangerous and hurtful hindrances.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. The Lord, by ſuch exerciſes, inſtructed me ſince, and at the time, in ſeveral uſeful leſſons—1. The Lord this way taught me how to walk with him. He dealt
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:030532_0125_0FE7C228598DCF20"/>with me as we are wont to do with children, he held me by the hand, he let me well nigh ſlip, Pſal. xciv. 18. and ſometimes fall, and this to let me know I was not able to go alone; and then he graciouſly raiſed me up, and comforted me, that I ſhould not by this be altogether diſcouraged from walking in his way, Hoſ. xi. 3, 4. <q>I taught Ephraim alſo to go, taking them by their arms, but they knew not that I healed them; I drew them with the cords of a man, and with bands of love. And I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat unto them.</q> 2. As the Lord, by the prevalency of ſin, taught the neceſſity of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive remedy, ſo by the experience of forgiveneſs, in ſuch caſes as I have mentioned, he taught the certainty of this, that this forgiveneſs is <hi>really</hi> as extenſive, rich and free, as the caſe requires, Pſal. xxxii. 5.3. He, by the experience of this, enabled me to underſtand better, and ſpeak more feelingly of theſe truths, than otherwiſe I could have done, and to comfort others with comforts, not only real, but experienced, even ſuch wherewith I my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had been <hi>comforted of God,</hi> 2 Cor. i. 4. Thus what I <hi>have heard</hi> and <hi>ſeen,</hi> and <hi>handled, of the word of life,</hi> that <hi>declared</hi> I to others, 1 John i. 1.4 The Lord gave ſome acquaintnance with the nature, exerciſe, and effects of the moſt uſeful and neceſſary graces of his Spirit, fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h, repentance, &amp;c. And finally, The Lord beat down ſelf very much by this exerciſe. Of this deſign the Lord, of late, while I read in my family in the 9th chapter of Denteronomy, gave me a pleaſant view, which I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent in the following remarks from that chapter.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. God's great deſign upon Iſrael, is to manifeſt the glory of his grace, mercy, patience, and faithfulneſs, in their ſalvation, their deliverance from Egypt, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them in poſſeſſion of Canaan, ſee ver. 5, 6.</item>
                     <item>2. Naturally ſinners, as all his people are ſuch, are, and appear very oppoſite to this deſign, being deeply ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh, as the whole of this chapter, and the ſcriptures ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt. And this ſelf has two branches, which are like its two eyes, <hi>ſelf ſtrength,</hi> and <hi>ſelf-righteouſneſs,</hi> ver. 1, 2. and ver. 5.6.</item>
                     <item>3. Self in theſe two branches is very ſtrong. We are
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:030532_0126_0FE7C27EB8ED3248"/>ready to pretend, that our own ſtrength carried us through difficulties, when once we have overcome them, which we were ſo far from being able of ourſelves to grapple with, that the very thoughts of them frighted us, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare ver. 1, 2. of this chapter, with the 13th and 14th chapters of Numbers. And we are ready to aſcribe to our own righteouſneſs what we get, when we, meanwhile, are not worthy of the leaſt of all God's mercies, ver. 5, 6, &amp;c.</item>
                     <item>4. Yet how ſtrong ſoever theſe are, they muſt be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued. In order thereto, the Lord, after he begins to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt himſelf to his people, leads them not preſently into Canaan; but carries them through the wilderneſs, where a variety of temptations draw out diſcoveries of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret corruptions, their weakneſs and wickedneſs, ſee ver. 6, 7.</item>
                     <item>5. The diſcoveries of God's patience, mercy and grace, and of his people's weakneſs and wickedneſs, eſpecially after remarkable manifeſtations of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e Lord, are means which the Lord makes uſe of, and remarkably blefies, to cure them of theſe diſtempers, and put out theſe two eyes of the wicked idol: Conſider the whole chapter.</item>
                     <item>6. The Lord, for this end, whenever he is about to complete, or carry on the begun deliverance and mercy, revives the impreſſion of theſe things. Read the whole chapter, particularly ver. 7.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Many other gracious deſigns did the Lord in this way carry on, he let me ſee the bitterneſs of ſin, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it to be exceeding ſinful; he let me ſee much of the helliſh ingratitude of my heart, he let me ſee the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of coming daily to the throne of grace, as for grace to help in time of need, ſo for mercy and forgiveneſs. He made me ſee with wonder, how one view of forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and pardoning mercy alienates the ſoul more from ſin, than twenty ſights, nay taſtes of hell, (which Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians cannot underſtand): And many other things.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Beſides theſe more groſs evils I fell into, through the violence of temptation, I was exerciſed about the guilt of ſins of daily incurſion and infirmity, deadneſs, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering in duty, and innumerable others. When I began to be firſt exerciſed about forgiveneſs, I was much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culted
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:030532_0127_0FE7C22E49E8E550"/>about theſe; and I ſhall, in the following particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, repreſent my exerciſe about them: 1. When the Lord manifeſted himſelf, his enemies fled before him, Pſal. lxviii. 1. and received a ſtunning ſtroke, as has been ſhewed. 2. It was ſometime before any of the ſtronger enemies diſcovered themſelves again, preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſins for a time, as has been repreſented, kept quiet. The firſt diſcoveries of the remaining power of indwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſin which I got, was in the invaſions of ſin of daily infirmity: 'For in many things we offend all,' James iii. 2.3. Hereon I began to be much diſcouraged, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther underſtanding well our ſtate here, that if any man ſay, He has <hi>no ſin,</hi> he <hi>deceives himſelf,</hi> 1 John i. 8. and the gracious proviſion made for this caſe in the covenant of grace, the daily ſacrifice, that is, the daily application to the throne of grace, the blood of atonement, the fountain opened, Pſal. xxx. 6. And ſo being under a fond and groundleſs expectation of entire freedom from ſin. 4. My fooliſh expectation being quickly diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the outbreaking of theſe ſins, I wiſt not what to do: I thought it hard to trouble him who had been ſo kind, to ſeek new favours, lia. vii. 13. The pride of my heart could not ſtoop to be continually, daily, hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beholden for new favours: I would have been a <hi>lord,</hi> and <hi>come no more to</hi> Chriſt, Jer. ii. 31. This pride was ſo maſked up, that at that time I did not diſcern it; but ſince the Lord has made it manifeſt. 5. But neceſſity has no law: they grew many; <q>For who can underſtand his errors?</q> Pſal. xix. 12. and the light of the Lord daily diſcovered more and more of them. 6. Hereon I eſſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to humble myſelf diſtinctly for every one of them, and to make a diſtinct application to the throne of grace about each; but when I began to obſerve them, they were ſo many, that if I had followed this courſe, my whole time would not have ſufficed: Hereon the Lord led me to that courſe, which a worthy friend, to whom I owe much for a diſtinct underſtanding of the Lord's work with me, told me what Franciſcus De Sales, a popiſh caſuiſt, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes to in this caſe—I was fain to take them all in the ump, or rather to go with them all on me at once, and plunge myſelf into the fountain that is opened for ſin and
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:030532_0128_0FE7C280E9CFACA0"/>for uncleanneſs, that is, I took a view of myſelf as defiled by innumerable evils of this ſort, and under a ſenſe of them, caſt myſelf upon the glorious atonement, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to lay ſtreſs for cleanſing as to them all, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch as I ciſcerned diſtinctly, or ſuch as I had not yet diſcovered, on that blood that <hi>cleanſeth from all ſin;</hi> which I think was the Pſalmiſt's way under the like caſe, Pſal. xix. 12, 13. <q>Who can underſtand his errors? cleanſe thou me from ſecret faults. Keep back thy ſervant alſo from preſumptuous ſins, let them not have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over me. Then ſhall I be upright, and I ſhall be innocent from the great tranſgreſſion.</q> That Popiſh caſuiſt before mentioned, as my worthy friend told me, illuſtrates this by a very elegant ſimilitude, <q>If a man ſee one or two filthy creatures on him he ſhakes or waſhes them off: But if he look and ſee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf all overſpread with ſuch, then he muſt bethink himſelf of ſome general courſe, he goes to ſome bridge, and leaps into a deep pool, and drowns them all, and leaves them behind him.</q> If any one groſſer ſin o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertake us, we muſt endeavour a diſtinct recovery and intimation of pardon by a diſtinct application to the blood of ſprinkling: But when we look upon theſe ſins which cannot be numbered and ſearched out, and which are ſtill growing, then we muſt betake ourſelves with the man to the bridge, and leap into the pool. 7. To clear this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter yet further, I obſerve, that the light wherein that plenteous redempton that is with God, was firſt diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though variouſly clouded and darkened, yet continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſome meaſure: A child of light continues <hi>light in the Lord;</hi> he may <hi>walk in darkneſs,</hi> and to his ſenſe <hi>have no light,</hi> Eph. v. 8. Iſa. l. 10. while yet it is the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of light that makes him diſcern his darkneſs, but he really is not darkneſs as before: He has his ſummer's ſun, that ſhines longer, brighter, and warmer; and his win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's ſun, that ſhines ſhorter, is more frequently clouded, and has leſs heat: He has his fair days and foul and rainy days, and a changeable intercourſe of day and night, wherein he has only the moon and ſtars; but light more or leſs there is ſtill. 8. When no extraordinary indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, no extraordinary darkneſs was on me, this habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:030532_0129_0FE7C22FD72B9C30"/>diſcovery of forgiveneſs, and the way to it, had its own uſe. The winter's ſun was not able to revive when I was caſt into any of thoſe diſtempers above-mentioned; and therefore, as has been above-narrared, in that caſe, I waited a blink of the ſen in its ſtrength; but for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, I by the direction of that light did endeavour daily, as to fins of infirmity, to betake myſelf in prayer to the blood of atonement, according as the Lord has taught us by the daily morning and evening ſacrifice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law: As for particular caſes and pollutions, there were other inſtitutions with reſpect to them. 9. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication by prayer to <hi>the redemption that is in Chriſt,</hi> even <hi>the forgiveneſs of ſin through ſaith in his blood,</hi> Rom. iii. 25. according to this diſcovery of it, in and by prayer, eſpecially when the Lord quickened by any new blink; (for the winter ſun has his warm and refreſhing blinks, even in the coldeſt ſeaſon): this application, I ſay, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when the Lord, as he frequently did, gave any new breathing, did relieve me, and help to quiet my conſcience as to the afflicting ſenſe of theſe ſins of daily incurſion: When the helped to pray for cleanſing from <hi>ſecret ſins,</hi> and keep back <hi>from preſumptuous ſins,</hi> Pſal. xix. 12.13. I was ſatisfied as to my uprightneſs and freedom from <hi>the great tranſgreſſion,</hi> and acceptance with him in following any duty of my ſtation, <hi>through the beloved.</hi> 10. As the caſe was not ſo urgent, ſo neither was the outgate ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernible: but it was ſufficient to anſwer in ſome meaſure the end above-mentioned, freedom from diſpiriting diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, and ſome meaſure of comfort and quiet as to my acceptance with God through Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>I conclude with four obſervations as to the whole: 1. Though we may ſometimes <hi>heal</hi> our own wound <hi>ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> yet it is God's prerogative to ſpeak ſolid <hi>peace,</hi> Iſa lvii. 19. yea, and the ſpeaking of it is a work of the greateſt power, where the conſcience is really exerciſed; it is a <hi>creating peace,</hi> and where he creates it, he can make it take effect, Job xxiv. 29. <hi>When he giveth quietneſs, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? Whether it be done againſt a nation or againſt a man only.</hi> 2. The Lord let me ſee, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the pride and unbelief of our hearts, and the

                  <p n="1">1. I Have before mentioned, and given ſome account of my trials about the being of God. Being now to give an account of the relief, it will be proper to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capitulate briefly my whole exerciſe with reſpect unto this head, and ſet the temptation and the relief together.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I have ſhewed above, that I was early, even as ſoon almoſt as I began to have any cloſe concern about reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:030532_0132_0FE7C28A619394C0"/>exerciſed with temptations in reference to this great and fundamental truth. But at firſt I had no arguments urged againſt this truth, or injected into my mind. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being made to ſee, that this was the hinge whereon the whole of religion turns, all hopes depend, and by which all practices were to be regulate, I found myſelf at a loſs for want of an evidence, ſufficiently clear and ſtrong, and convincing, which I thought neceſſary, with reſpect to a truth whereon ſo much weight was to be laid. In a word, I was at <hi>Pharaob's</hi> paſs, Exod. v. 2. <hi>Who is the Lord that I ſhould obey him, and let Iſrael go?</hi> Plainly, very great things are demanded of me, and I am called to hope for great things, and before I truſt ſo far, I would be ſatisfied to know more of that God in whom I am to truſt, as to ſo great things.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But afterwards Satan attacked me by ſubtile injec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as I have ſhewed before, took me at a diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, when I was eſtranged from God, and my head intent upon abſtract ſubtilities, and while I followed ſuch vain ſpeculations, intruding into things I had not ſeen, he took his opportunity, and ſaid daily, <hi>Where is thy God?</hi> Pſalm xlii. 3, 10. And when he had got me down, he triumphed, <hi>where is now</hi> that <hi>mouth,</hi> with which thou didſt all along reproach Atheiſts? Such are their arguments, try your ſtrength with them, and <hi>fight them,</hi> Judg. ix. 38.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Hereon a ſharp conflict began to be managed in my breaſt. On the one hand, Satan, in conjunction with the natural atheiſm of my heart, plied me hard with <hi>fiery dares,</hi> Eph. vi. 16. and ſubtile ſophiſtry, arguments ſometimes aſtoniſhing, ſo far were they above my reach. On the other hand, I, a poor apoſtate creature, ſadly dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, but yet retaining ſome remainders of light, which God has made <hi>manifeſt</hi> in my conſcience, Rom i. 19. as in theſe of other men, and ſomewhat confirmed in thoſe notions of God by education, the outward diſpenſation of the word, and it may be, by ſome common work of the Spirit, riveting all the former, keeping alive theſe impreſſions, or at leaſt reſtraining Satan and my corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from blotting them out. Againſt that formidable
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:030532_0133_0FE7C2372C8CB960"/>confederacy, I, ſuch a one as I have now repreſented my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, made head, and ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="5">5. In this conflict, I uſed various ways: 1. I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times rejected the ſuggeſtions, and refuſed them a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, <hi>Who art th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> dare ſcarce ſay it out. 2. Sometimes I prevented them as it were, and not only refuſed an hearing, but repreſenting in my own ſoul how deep reſentment ſuch a provocation, ſuch a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion deſerved. If any man will <hi>plead</hi> againſt God, or <hi>for Baal,</hi> none ſhall intreat for him, but he ſhould ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>be pat to death,</hi> Judg. vi. 31.3. When the impudent enemy would not thus be put <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But his inſtances were ſo many, and ſo ſubtile, that I could not prevail this way; but the longer I ſtood arguing the caſe, I was put in the greater loſs, Rev. xii. 9. When he comes in ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king terms, he is too hard for us; and no wonder he be ſo for us, he worſted our ſirit parents in innocence. 4 When I found this, then I oft would wiſh for a diſcovery of God himſelf. O that he would appear, and <hi>O that I knew where I might find him,</hi> Job xxiii. 2. when my wiſhes took no effect. 5. The devil hereon took advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to tell me, that he did not appear, and that ſurely, if there was a God, he would help one that was ſtanding up for him in ſuch a ſtrait, Pſalm xxii. 6. In this caſe, I ſometimes hoped that he would ariſe, and then mine enemies would be made to flee before him: Though the truth is, I could but give little reaſon for it. 6. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I prayed. Satan urged me with the unreaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of praying, till I was once ſure there was a God. And I confeſs I was ſometimes hardly put to it, to defend the practice; yet I always inclined to the affirmative, and thought, that it there was a God, as I durſt not ſay but I had reaſon to think there was, he could beſt ſatisfy me as to his own being, 2 Kings xix. 10.7. I was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times obliged to flee him, and ſeek ſanctuary in diverſions. 6. Sometimes the Lord mercifully reſtrained him, and be <hi>leſt</hi> me <hi>for a ſeaſon.</hi>

But conſidering I was then an unhumbled enemy, God could not have appeared otherwiſe than as an enemy, and I could not have thus <hi>ſeen</hi> him and <hi>lived,</hi> Exod. xxxiii. 10. Such an appearance would indeed have made me <hi>believe and tremble,</hi> James ii. 19. But this would have caſt me into new trouble. Wherefore the Lord led me to right ſatisfaction another way: He diſcovered ſin in the way above mentioned, and by this diſcovery, as I have now hinted, diverted the violence of this temptation, and broke its force, as has been above hinted: For <hi>be ſtays his rough wind in the day of his eaſt wind,</hi> Iſa. xxvii. 8.

                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. TO give a clear account of the iſſue of my tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it will be neceſſary that I ſhortly recapitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late what formerly has been ſpoken concerning the trial, and my carriage under is.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This tempation did not attack me ſo early as the former, but it was managed much in the ſame way; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times my mind only hung in ſuſpenſe, and hovered in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty, for want of evidence proportioned to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the truth for my faith to fix on: At other times, I was ſtrangely haraſſed with violent temptations, multiplied and ſubtile objections which were thronged daily in on my mind, by reading books full of them, by converſe with enemies to the word, by Satan's ſuggeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which were by much the more ſubtile and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome to me.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This exerciſe was in ſome meaſure more perplexing than the former, becauſe it was no leſs ruining to all ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying religion; the objections were much more plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they were far more in number, and entertained by perſons of a better character, and the evidence of the truth lay farther from the reach of an unenlightened mind.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Before the iſſue came, the Lord gave, by conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations formerly mentioned, ſometimes a merciful check unto temptations, and kept them from overwhelming me quite; of which I have formerly given ſome account.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. I tried many ways beſides prayer and attendance upon ordinances; I bought, borrowed, and read many books, written in defence of them, which wanted not its own ſolid uſe; for hereby I got a deep rational convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the truth, and ſo was emboldened to plead for them againſt enemies, and oft times to beat them at their
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:030532_0139_0FE7C243CA1BA968"/>own weapons: and I got many particular objections fully anſwered, and was hereby encouraged to wait for full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, without deſpairing. Eſpecially one book had this uſe; after I had, without the ſatisfaction I deſired, though nor without the fruits above-mentioned, peruſed my later writings, the Lord <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p n="6">6. Yet after all this, my mind <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Where I was not preſently cleared, the Lord gave me ſubſiſtence, as it were ſomething to live on till light came; he ſatisfied me from the word, of the reaſons of his expreſſing himſelf in the ſcriptures in parables to the multitude; and he told me, that what he did and ſaid, I knew not now, but encouraged me to hope, that I ſhould <hi>know hereafter,</hi> John xiii. 7. when my need required it. 4.

He let me ſee his wiſdom and goodneſs in training me up to dependence, for opening of <hi>my eyes to ſee the wonders of</hi> his <hi>law,</hi> Pſalm cxix. 18. Job xxxiv. 32. and leading me to importune him, that what I knew not he might teach, John xvi. 12, 13. and diſcovering hereby that I knew but in part, and ſtood in need of the <hi>Spirit</hi> to <hi>guide unto all truth,</hi> to bring all to remembrance, 1 Cor. xiii. 12. and that it was my duty to <hi>meditate in Gods law day and night,</hi> Pſalm i. 2. and ſearch the ſcriptures, and that with much humility, ſince <hi>the ſecret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he</hi> ſhews <hi>them his covenant,</hi> and he guides <hi>the meek in judgment,</hi> and clearly teaches them <hi>his way,</hi> Pſalm xxv. 9, 10, 12, 14.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. I Have above ſhewed, that Satan, who had oft temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me to pride, when he found it for his intereſt, turned himſelf another way, and made it his work to drive to a baſtard ſort of humility. When I was caught in the thicket of his temptations about the truth of the ſcriptures, and other things of an alike nature, and was uſing means to get my mind relieved; he oft, with much importunity, urged me with this thought, <hi>"To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe do ye ſeek for ſatisfaction, or how can ye be ſo vain, as to expect it about theſe things, wherein men of incomparably greater reach, abilities, diligence and opportunities, have been obliged to remain unſatisfied, and upon that account, have given up with them?"</hi> This temptation was often
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:030532_0145_0FE7C2AF24AE9830"/>urged with that hell'ſh violence, that I had no ſpirit left in me by it: I was ready to let my hands hang down, my knees turned feeble, and my mouth was oft at ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it out, that there was <hi>no hope,</hi> and I went about to make myſelf deſpair of any good, <hi>fruit</hi> of any <hi>labour</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, or that could by me be exerciſed, and laid out under <hi>the ſun.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. When the Lord made the foregoing diſcovery of himſelf to me, the force of this temptation was quite broke, by ſeeing the truths of God in his own light. But I got not a particular diſcovery of the weakneſs of this temptation then, till ſome time after reading in my ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, the three firſt-chapters of the Firſt to the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, the Lord was pleaſed to open mine eyes, and make me underſtand the weakneſs of this temptation. The light that then ſhined upon my ſoul from, and by this portion of ſcripture, and the ſatisfaction of ſoul it gave, as to this temptation, no words can expreſs: Nor can I, at this diſtance of time, narrate all that then the Lord made convincingly clear to me from his word. Yet the ſubſtance I do remember, and ſhall repreſent in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing remarks.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Firſt</hi> God here repreſented to me, that his great deſign in the method of ſalvation made choice of by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wiſdom, was to ſtain the pride of all glory; that <hi>no fleſh might glory in his ſight.</hi> But that <hi>he that glories</hi> ſhould <hi>glory</hi> only <hi>in the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Lord diſcovered, that a vain ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be wiſe above what God allowed, was the ſpring and principal part of our apoſtacy from God; and that ever ſince Satan firſt dropt that poiſon into our natures, it has wrought ſtrongly: <hi>Vain man would be wiſe. The Jews aſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That in order to the attainment of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going deſign, and indeed for the recovery of man, it was plainly neceſſary, that man's ambition in this matter ſhould be effectually checked. This being a principal branch of our corruption, if it were not cured we were not completely recovered. This lying in a plain oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the deſign of God, if it were not levelled, this deſign could not be reached. Hereon it became neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,

                  <p>WHEN I was under the violent ſtrugglings rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the account of the ſecond part of my life, I had daid by all thoughts of the work of the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. It was like hell once, to entertain a thought of preaching to others what I did not believe myſelf: But now things began to alter, and the Lord led me on to that which I declined before: And I find the ſteps of his providence about me in this matter, do deſerve to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered by me. 1. My mother did devote me from my childhood to this work, and oft expreſſed her deſire to <hi>lend me to the Lord</hi> all the days of my life, to ſerve him in the <hi>goſpel of his Son:</hi> This has oft had its own weight on my ſpirit. 2. The courſe of my ſtudies had looked that way; my education pointed towards that work; which providential determination of my ſtudies, though I had no greatregard to it at ſometimes, yet on other occaſions it had ſome weight on my ſpirit, that I dorſt not raſhly turn my thoughts another way. 3. The Lord forcibly, by his providence, did break my deſign of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the ſtudy of philoſophy, by the foregoing exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, of which I have given an account, brought my mind to acquieſce in this diſpenſation, and made philoſophy comparatively diſtaſteful, and it was upon the ſerious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of the temptations moving me to incline that way, made extremely unſavory. 4. The Lord having thus looſed my heart from that ſtudy, that for a while did ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:030532_0155_0FE7C2BC5E1A3CE0"/>it with the ſtudy of divinity; he did alſo, by the foregoing iſſue of my dark exerciſe, remove and take <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> way the principal ſtumbling blocks, and make the way ſtraight. 5. He further, by the diſcovery of his glory in the face of Chriſt, engaged my heart to, and endeared to my ſoul the knowledge of Chriſt, and him crucified. 5. He brought me under a lively ſenſe of that forcible tie that was hereon laid on me, to lay out myſelf in any way that he ſhould call me to be ſerviceable to him, and I was made to think, that I ſhould be the more happy, the more directly my work ſhould look that way. 7. While, like Peter, I was muſing ſometimes on theſe things, about the month of April or May, 1698, two miniſters were ſent, to my great ſurpriſe, from the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery of Kirkaldie, urging me to enter on trials: I did altogether decline the propoſal, becauſe I had no reading, wanted the languages and had been much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from the ſtudy, particularly by the foregoing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, which had filled my thoughts for near a year and a half, and it was not then two years ſince I came from the college. In a word, I did anſwer, <hi>I am child, and cannot ſpeak,</hi> Jer. i. 6. And here I ſtuck, ſurpriſed and toſſed with thoughts what this might mean, and whence it was, for I had ſcarce ever looked near the preſbytery. They preſcribed John i. 12. for a text, and left me to conſider of it. 8. I found my averſion ſtrong to enter ſo ſoon at leaſt on trials; but ſtill it had ſome weight on my ſpirit, and I did think further of it, and found that the Lord's dealing with me of late, in the great variety of trials, caſting me down, and raiſing me up again and again, looked as a preparation for <hi>comforting others with the conſolations wherewith I had been comforted,</hi> and ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathizing with them, as having had experience of a great variety of tempations, and I found that by theſe my lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle knowledge of the myſtery of the goſpel received ſome improvement. The miniſters continued to ſolicit me, and and preſs home their deſire; but while I ſtood out againſt their ſolicitations, though not without ſome ſecret ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle and doubting, whether in ſo doing I might not be declining duty, I began to obſerve the Lord raiſing a ſtorm againſt me: I began to ſee the ſnares of the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:030532_0156_0FE7C317C1F4FDE8"/>I was in, the advantages my corruptions had by it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me; and, in a word the Lord made it out to me, that I behoved to change my ſtation; but I was not hereby clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to comply with their de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ire, yet I durſt not flatly decline it. About this I much toſſed, May 20, 1698. The Lord was taking away ſome that had been moſt helpful and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging, my inward perplexities grew, and I was not like to have peace in my own mind. 10. While I was in this caſe, Mr. Riddel did, May 30, come to the Wemyſs, and after much converſe, and many reaſonings, charged me to try, and have my thoughts on my text, and then do, or ſtand off, as the Lord ſhould clear duty, which I did conſent to. 11. But after this I ſtill did ſhift and decline, and could not think of a compliance; and then December 28, provoſt Ramſay wrote, carneſtly deſiring me to take the charge of my lord Maitland. This put me to a ſtand a little, and I was inclined to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it at firſt: But on farther conſideration I was fully cleared to reject that motion, and ſo I remained in my former ſtrait, crying to the Lord frequently, that he might diſcover duty. I was fully ſatisfied that I beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not to ſtay there, but yet was averſe from the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, at leaſt ſo ſoon. But that which had well nigh turned me quite off, was an expreſs from my friend and my father's, the worthy Mr. James Duncan, urging me, in the moſt preſſing terms, to take the charge of my lord Duplin's children, offering what encouragement I pheaſed. My father's deep obligation to that family, and ſeveral other things, carried my inclination toward a compliance: But having at Mr. Forreſter's earneſt deſire, undertaken a homily in the new college, which I was to deliver next week, I took time to conſider of it; and after that I had, on February 28, 1699, delivered my diſcourſe on Job xxviii. 28. I went to viſit my acquaintance, worthy Mr. Shields, who did urge me to enter on trials, with that gravity and concern, that had more weight on my ſpirit, than all that had been ſpoken to me. Upon this, and other things that offered themſelves to view, I was fully ſatisfied it was duty to lay aſide thoughts of Mr. Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can's propoſal. 22.

                  <p>BEING thus licenſed, June 22, 1699, at Kirkaldie. I continued preaching as appointed or defired every Lord's day, for moſt part, bleſſed be God, not without ſome countenance and ſucceſs. November 25, the call of South Leith came to me, where I had preached ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time before. Mr. Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I took them to conſideration, and gave no manner of hopes to any. I found myſelf in a great ſtrait between Leith and Ceres, and it was much the greater, that both poſts lay not within one province: and ſo there was no judicature equally concerned in both, to whom I might ſubmit; ſo that I was neceſſitated to make a choice myſelf. After ſome endeavours with my own heart, to bring it to a willingneſs to cloſe with ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as God ſhould clear up duty, I did ſet myſelf to

                        <item>2. The unanimity of their call, after they had been long otherwiſe.</item>
                        <item>3. The colleague was moſt deſirable, and one from whom I might learn much, both as to preaching and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline.</item>
                        <item>4. There was a conſiderable number of godly in the place.</item>

                  <p>On the other hand, for Ceres, it was of weight—
<list>
                        <item>1. That the pariſh was conſiderable, had been entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without one of a long time, had been divided, and were now harmonious; whereas Leith was well ſupplied of one.</item>
                        <item>2. That whereas Leith lying near Edinburgh, they had the choice of young men, and had men of weight and activity, and intereſt to obtain whom they had a mind to; it was otherwiſe with Ceres.</item>
                        <item>3. Where colleagues are moſt deſirable, a collegiate life is not without ſuch difficulties as ſhould incline one not to run into them without an evident call.</item>
                        <item>4. I had not enjoyed time for reading, and could not in a town, and that ſo near Edinburgh, where the charge was ſo great, have any time for improvement which I might hope for in the country, at leaſt in the winter ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</item>
                        <item>5. The charge was leſs than the half of Leith, and my body was but weak.</item>
                        <item>6. I found my temper ſoft and unmeet for managing the humours of town's people.</item>
                        <item>7. I found my beſt friends, whom I had reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, as deſigning nothing but my good, firm of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that Ceres was the moſt ſuitable charge.</item>

Having weighed all, and laid the matter before the Lord as I could, I at length came to a reſolption, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the call of Leith, and did, Jaruary 2, 1700, gave it up, and cloſe with that of Ceres, to the great diſtatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the miniſter and people of Leith, who had been at more pains with me than I deſerved.

                  </head>
                  <p>AFTER he was licenſed to preach, and before he was ordained to the miniſtry, on ſome ſolemn occaſions, he dedicated himſelf to the ſervice of the Lord, with earneſt player for the ſuitable endowments whereby be might be fitted for the diſcarge of that high truſt, iſ it ſhould pleaſe God to call him to it. This occurs frequently in his dairy, whereof take an inſtance on two in his own words.</p>
                  <p>April 18, 1700 being the faſt in order to Lefly's ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, I roſe early in the morning; and after ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of my former ways, and ſerious thoughtſulneſs of the deſign of the preſent duty, I did in prayer pour out my ſoul to God, confeſſing fins; and I dare not ſay, but it was with ſome tender ſenſe of the diſhonour done to God, and of the wretched unkindneſs that is in them to God. Original ſin, imputed and inherent, were both hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and my par icular evils. I did ſolemnly revew my engagements to the Lord, accepting of Chriſt according to the goſpel ofter and terms, and did endeavour parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to act faith on him, with reſpect to the miniſterial endowments, and did devote my ſelf to him in that ſervice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="161" facs="unknown:030532_0160_0FE7A1619D1EA2B8"/>
                     <hi>May</hi> 1, 1700, being the day of his ordination. This morning I renewed my engagements to God, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of Chriſt upon the goſpel terms, catting myſelf over open him, not only for what belongs to me as a private Chriſtian, but as a miniſter, eyeing his ſtrength for through-boarance in the whole of the work, particularly pleading forents preſence this day; I cannot deny his preſence in ſector. Mr. Alexander Pitcairn miniſter in Kilmeny preached the ordination ſermon, on Hebrews xiii. 17. Where he inſiſted upon the watchmen's duty, I cannot deny, but my heart was much weighed with the ſenſe of the greatneſs of the work, and after I had anſwer. ed the queſtions put to me concerning my loundneſs in the faith, and the ſincerity of my purpoſes in underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king king the office and work of the holy miniſtry, I was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained. <hi>Lord, then knoweſt what my beart's deſire to thee was in the time. O Lord, help, and through grace I ſhall lay out myſelf for gaining finners to thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Being thus entered into the miniſtry, he ſtudied and prepared his ſermens with much ſerious ſecret prayer for divine aſſiſtance and direction in his work, and for a ſucceſsful bleſſing upon the word, both to himſelf and his hearers.</p>
                  <p>His practice alſo was to review and remark his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and acquitting himſelf in public duties, as to what aſſiſtance and enlargement he obtained, as to the gravity, ferion ſneſs, tenderneſs in his own frame, as to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for the ſoul or hearers, as to the warming of his aſſections with the comfons and ravithing ſweetneſs of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truths. And when he was remarkably helped, it iſſued in thankſgiving to God, and watching against vain pride and ſelf, that that might not rob the Lord of the glory of his free grace. When otherwiſe, it was matter of humiliation to him.</p>
                  <p>Knowing that he was called to <q>watch for ſouls, as one that muſt give an account,</q> he had the weight of the mienlerial charge much upon his ſpirit: He was there fore at pains to acquaint himſelf with the ſpiritual ſtate of the ſouls of his ſtock, that he might be the more capable of dealing with them for their edification, according to their particular caſes. In order thereunto, ſo far as health and
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:030532_0161_0FE7C2C672325398"/>ſtrength did allow, he was diligent in viſiting all the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies within his pariſh, in inſtructing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Take one inſtance of this in his own words, as they are found written, July 8 1703, when he had laboured about three years in the miniſtry at Ceres.</p>

                     <item>2. All who were thus convinced, did declare, that any awakenings ever they had, were either under the preachers in the field, or fince the revolucion. This whatever may become of the ministers, is a teſtimony to their way, and ſays, that they are called of God.</item>

                  <p>One reaſons why the goſpel is ſo unſucceſsful at this day, is, becauſe the ſimplicity of preaching is neglected; a due application of ſcripture is beſt preaching, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming which it is remarkable, that though God may make uſe of the words of man in letting into the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, yet it is the very ſcripture word, whereby he ordinarily conveys the comfort or advantage of whatever fort, <hi>it is the tool of God's own framing that works the of, ſect.</hi>

                  <p>I ſaw the evil of legal preaching, which lies in one of two things, or in both—1. In laying to much ſtreſs upon the works of the law, our duties and ſtrength: Or, 2, In preſſing evangelical doctrines without an eye to that which is the ſpring of the church's edification, the Spirit of the Lord. Some preſs to duties, ſo that they ſeem to think, that their reaſonings are able to enforce a compliance; or at leaſt, they do not take care to keep up upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and hearers both a conſtant ſenſe of the contrary, in order to engage in eagerneſs in dependence upon the Spirit of the Lord: This is legal preaching. <hi>O Lord, thou knows how much of it is in the church.</hi> The goſpel glory is, that it is the miniſtration of the ſpirit: The great pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of believers is, that the Lord <hi>manifeſts</hi> himſelf to them, as he does <hi>not to the world.</hi> When he manifeſts his authority in the command, it is then powerful: When he manifeſts his goodneſs and truth in the promiſe, it is full of ſweetneſs: When he manifeſts his wrath in the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening, it awes the ſoul: When he manifeſts his glory in the face of Chriſt, it is raviſhing, reforming, attracting.</p>

                  <p>Two thing I ſhall note, 1. The Lord gave me a ſweet diſcovery this day in lecture, of the athelſm of the hearts of men, in rejecting the word, (notwithſtanding there are more, and more evident prints of God on it, than on all his other works of creation), becauſe they cannot get through ſome difficultier in it; whereas there are many more difficulties in the works of God: The light where by this was ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That it is a high attainment in religion, to win to know that <hi>God is the Lord,</hi> (Dent. iv. 35.); and to believe that all ſin is reſolvable in darkneſs and unbelief, as to this one point, <hi>that God is the Lord,</hi> and conſequently, that all ſin is reducible to atheiſm.</p>
                  <p>That the great difficulty which the whole of the divine revelation grapples with, is Atheiſm; and that its ſtruggle is to recovery man to his firſt impreſtions of a God. This one point comprehends the whole of man's recovery; as atheiſm the whole of man's apoſtacy.</p>

                  <p>What a different caſe am I in now, from what I was a little whiſe ago! then I was in a pleaſant habitation, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with wife, children, conveniences; in a habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion well illuminated with pleaſant light, whereby I ſaw my enjoyments, diſcerned the pleaſantneſs of them, and their ſuitableneſs. I had neceſſaries, quiet of mind, and opportunity to retire to my cloſet to converſe with God, wherewith I was refreſhed.</p>
                  <p>But what a change do I now find! I am engaged in a journey, my is dark, I find it cold.

                  <p>Have I not here a view of man's ſtate in innocency, and his ſtate when fallen?</p>
                  <p>But what a change do I find! Light begins to appeat! Had I never ſeen it, I ſhould have had no notion of it! What a ſurpriſe is this? When did it begin? How did it grow? Where were my ſenſes? Did not I look on, and yet I cannot ſee, and cannot tell how it began, nor whence! <hi>So is every one that is born of the ſpirit.</hi>

                  <p>December 13, 1700. This forenoon I ſet apart for prayer; and being to addreſs God in reference to my propoſal of marriage with J. W.

                  <p>In the morning I began this day with prayer, wherein I did endeavour to trace back ſin to my very infancy, and found the Lord countenancing me, by bringing ſin to remembrance. Lord, I have been in all ſin; not one of
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:030532_0181_0FE7C2EAF65DD0F0"/>thy commands but I have broken, and that almoſt in all inſtances, ſave that I have been kept from the outward acts, and no thanks to me that it is ſo; for Lord, thou knoweſt it was only thy reſtraining grace that kept me from any ſin. O! how ignorant are they of their own natures, or elſe of how ſar different natures from mine are they, that deny original ſin; it may be, ſome of them, had they been acquaint with my way and manner from my youth, would have been apt to think me of a good nature, and not given to ill; but O how ignorant are they who think ſo! though I had not the enſnating influence of bad company to draw me aſide, yet without tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I was inclined to ſin, and that againſt nature's light, very early. Whatever others ſpeak of their good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Lord, I muſt own mine ſinful, and that all <hi>the maginations of the thoughts of my heart have been only evil from my youth up.</hi> When I look at my face in the glaſs of the holy law, Lord, how black is it! Nothing but ſin wherever I ſet mine eye.</p>
                  <p>The Lord helped me to confeſs ſin, and did thereby give a freſh ſight of the need of Chriſt in all his offices, of his excellency, ſufficiency, and ſuitableneſs; and drew out my ſou! ſolemnly to accept of him, renouncing all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ways of ſalvation, devoting myſelf in my ſtation, as a miniſter, to him, waiting for, and expecting from him (according to his moſt gracious promiſe and office, as the Prince exalted to give giſts to men), ſuch ſupplies of gifts and grace, as are needful for my faithful acquittance in the diſcharge of that office. Likewiſe I did ſolemnly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote myſelf in this new relation I was to enter in, to him, pleading, that he would not contend with either of us for the ſins of our ſingle life, that he would make us holy, and grant us to walk before him, and that he would bleſs us with all the comforts of a married ſtate, fitting us every way for one another.</p>
                  <p>In my ſecond addreſs to God by prayer, the Lord gave me much ſweetneſs and enlargement, in reference to that particular, for which I ſet apart this day. Bleſſed be God for his Spirit's directing what to pray for, and aſſiſting in prayer; I hope this ſhall be comfortable: <hi>When be prepares the heart</hi> to pray, he inclines <hi>the ear to hear.</hi>

The diſciples were againſt Chriſt's taking notice of them, or putting any particular mark of reſpect on them. 4. But Chriſt rebuked them, and ſaid, <hi>Suffer little children to come unto me, and ſorbid them not.</hi> Though the diſeiples would not have us to expect any evidence of the Lord's ſpecial love to young ones, yet the Lord is of another mind. 5. The Lord approved of the parents bringing, and bleſſed the children. 6. Here the Lord calarged me, helped me to rely on him, that he would put his hand on the child and bleſs her, and hereby quieted my ſoul, and filled me with thankſolneſs; and I was reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to the child that is gone, and this that is dying: <hi>Bleſs, bleſs, bleſs the Lord, O my ſoul; be prepares the heart</hi> to pray, and he will <hi>incline the ear to bear.

                  <p>WEDNESDAY, September 17th, when a friend came and aſked him in the morning, how he had reſted the by gone night? He anſwered, not well; and told, he had this night been ſore toſſed with the thoughts of eternity; but, ſaid he, I dare not ſay they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractiag. My evidences are much clouded indeed. I have been thinking on <hi>terribilia Dei,</hi> [i. c. the terrible things of GOD], and all that is difficult in death to a ſaint. All my enemies have been round about me. I have had a great conflict, and faith like to fail. O! that I may be kept now in this laſt trial, that is enſuing, from being an offence to his people.</p>

Afternoon, when ſome of his brethren came in to viſit him, he ſaid to them, I am but young, and have little experience; but this death-bed now makes me old; and therefore I uſe the freedom to exhort you to faithfulneſſ in the Lord's work. Ye will never repent this. He is a good maſter; I have always ſound him ſo; if I had a thouſand lives, I would think them all too little to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy in his ſervice.</p>
                  <p>All this whole day, and ſome days preceding, he was under a cloud and deſertion.</p>
                  <p>September 18, when a friend returned to aſk him how he was, in the morning; he broke ſilence with theſe words, O what a terrible conflict had I yeſterday! But now I can ſay, <hi>I have ſought the good fight, I have kept the faith.</hi> Now he has filled my mouth with a <hi>new ſong, Jebovah jireb, in the mount of the Lord, &amp;c.

What a wonder that I enjoy ſuch compoſure under all my bodily trouble, and in view of approaching death! O what a mercy that I have the uſe of my reaſon till I have declared his goodneſs to me!</p>

                  <p>To his wife he ſaid, My dear encourage yourſelf in the Lord; he will keep you, though you even come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong enemies hands; ſurely he will cauſe the enemy to treat you well. And then declaring his willingneſs to part with his deareſt relations, he ſaid. This is the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of religion, ſirs; this is a practical part of religion to make uſe of it when we come to the pinch: This is a leſſon of practical divinity.</p>
                  <p>When the phyſician came in, he ſaid, Is my pulſe weak, doctor? Anſ. Yes; but I have ſeen it as weak. Then he ſaid, Doctor, as to this piece of work, you are near an end with it. I wiſh you may lay it to heart; it will come to your door too: And it is a buſineſs of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to die like a Chriſtian. And it is a rarity. Chriſt himſelf has told us, that <hi>there are but few that ſhall be ſaved,</hi> even among them who are called outwardly. I

The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt kindacſs I am now capable to ſhew you, is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend ſerious religion to you. There is a reality in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, doctor; this is an age that hath loſt the ſenſe of it. <hi>He has not ſaid to the houſe of Jacob, ſeek ye may ſace us vain.</hi> Atheiſis will ſee one day, whether it be ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not.</p>
                  <p>I bleſs God I was educated by godly parents, in the: principles of the church of Scotland: I bleſs him, that when I came to riper years, I did, on mature delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, make them my choice: I bleſs the Lord I have been helped ever ſince to adhere to them, without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering: I bleſs him I have ſeen, that holineſs yields peace and comfort in proſperity and adverſity: What ſhould I ſeek more, or deſire more, to give evidence of the reality of it? Therefore, <hi>I am not aſhamed of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pol of Chriſt; becauſe it is the power of God to ſalvation to every one that believeth.</hi> I am ſo far from altering my thoughts of religion, by reaſon of the preſent contempt thrown on it, and oppoſition made to it, that this endears it the more to me.</p>
                  <p>As to the ſimplicity of goſpel worſhip, many muſt have gaudy pomp now a days in worſhip; it is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of the decay of religion; for when folk want the power and ſpirituality of it, they muſt have ſomething to pleaſe the carnal heart. This is my ſenſe of it; and it is <hi>the words of truth and ſoberneſs;</hi> and I ſpeak as being ſhoaly to appear in judgment; and hope to <hi>give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi> of this <hi>with joy,</hi> as a part of the <hi>teſtimony of Jeſus.</hi>

                  <p>Well, doctor, the Lord be with you, and perſuade you to be in earneſt. I return you thanks for you dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. Is my pulſe low? Anſ. Yes.

                  </p>
                  <p>After a pauſe, he ſaid, Every one that is in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus muſt be a <hi>new creature;</hi> He muſt have union with Chriſt, and a new nature: That is the ground work of religion. The Chriſtian religion is little underſtood by the moſt part of us.</p>

O the goſpel of Chriſt, how purely was it preached in this place, when I was at the univerſity! though I found not the ſweetneſs in the time, when I heard others preach on theſe ſubjects, I found it ſince; and it has fallen on me like ſhowers on the mown graſs; vetily, there is a reality in religion: Few have the lively impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of it.</p>
                  <p>Now get acquaintance with God; the little acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance I have had with God within theſe two days, has been better than ten thouſand times the pains I have all my life been at about religion. It is good to have him to go to, when we are turning our <hi>face to the wall: He is known for a refuge in the palaces of Zion, a very preſent help in trouble.</hi>

                  <p>O there is a ſtrange hardneſs in the heart of man! I believe there are few men come to age, but, when they ſee others dying, have a conviction that they muſt die, and yet are not duly affected with it. It is like one riſing <hi>from the dead,</hi> what they meet with. <hi>But they have Moſes and the prophets; if they will not hear then, neither would they hear, though one ſhould riſe from the dead.</hi> We muſt have an ear from God before we can hear. <hi>Ye hear not my words,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>becauſe ye are not of God.</hi> However, <hi>Whether</hi>

                  <p>We are fooliſh creatures, we would have all the trial at our diſpoſal, and limit the Lord as to the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of our trial.

                  <p>Afterwards, to his children he ſaid, My bairns, I have nothing to ſay to you, but be ſeekers of God, <hi>fulfil my joy.</hi> Ah! that I was ſo long of beginning to ſeck God; and yet I was touched with convictions that God was ſeeking me ere I arrived at the years of ſome of you.</p>

                  <p>In the forenoon, to a gentlewoman he ſaid, Madam, I wait for the ſupplies of the Spirit of the Lord Jeſus, whereby I may be able to finiſh my courſe with joy. I began a text at Ceres, (being his farewel ſermon), and ſmiling, ſaid, I ſticked it, I went not through with it. When I came to St. Andrews, I began where I left at Ceres, <hi>I go bound to Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c. Acts xx. 22, 23.

I was very clear of God's calling me hither, come of it what will, whether I ſignify any thing or not. What would befal me I did not know, I had a very dark proſpect, eſpecially from this place, that had ſo much deſpiſed goſpel light; and that when he was taking away his ſervants here, it made me tremble to think that wrath was coming, and that I could do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to hold it off; I can ſignify nothing.

He has <hi>brought life and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality to light.</hi> One ſaid, Keep your gripes to the laſt; Satan is buſy. He anſwered, I have had trial of it already. O! ſober, ſober religion is neceſſary. I was often ſtealing from the Lord: but bleſſed be his name, he made me lay it down again with ſhame, and to cry, <hi>Not I,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Cor. xv. 10. I was ay afraid in public on that account.</p>
                  <p>He cauſed read one of Mr. Rutherford's letters, (viz. to Mr. John Mein, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, What can a poor wretch ſignify? I'll tell you, brother, what I have thought a year and a day, I am no prophet, I pretend to know nothing but what the word of God leads to; my thoughts of taking off the ſervants of God at this time, are, I fear it is coming to that, that there is no ſtop to be put to the overflowing ſcourge: there is like to be a general overflowing conſumption, running over not only this, but all the reformed churches. Sovereignty I will not limit.</p>
                  <p>Afterward one was ſhowing the difficulty we would have, while in the body, with indwelling corruption. He anſwered. I oft find it; but the Lord has relieved me: I found this ſame night, even after the Lord gave relief, indwelling ſin ſhewing a great deal of ſtrength. One ſaid, you know while you are in the body, that will

                  <p>After a little interruption, he ſaid, In the day when I was in my diſtreſs, and brought to the foot of mount Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai, <hi>the mount that might be tonched.</hi> (it was a ſenſible thing, but by divine appointment it might not be touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed). and when I came to the <hi>blackneſs and darkneſs,</hi> and heard the craſhing of thunder, &amp;c.

                  <p>To the apothecaty he ſaid, The Lord is upholding me. The Lord ſhew you mercy; ſtudy religion in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of your years: mind, if you come to be handied as I am, without it you can have no comfort. I give you this as a ſolemn warning, if you come to be hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by the frequent fights of perſons in my circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, you may come to be hardened for ever, and your conſcience never be ſenſible more.</p>
                  <p>To three miniſters in the place, he ſaid, My dear bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ye are all there that are in the town, except my dear colleague, and I have ſent for him: Dear brethren, it is not from any conſidence in myſelf, but out of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere love to you, and from what I myſelf have felt, that for your encouragement I preſume to ſay, when the Lord helped to diligence in ſtudying and meditating, I found him then remarkably ſhining upon me, and teſtifying his approbation of a ſincere mint. There is nothing to be had with a ſlack hand.</p>
                  <p>Then to one of them lately entered into the miniſtry he ſaid, Your entry into the miniſtry is like to fall in an evil day; there is one thing for your encouragement, you have a call: The times will make hard work to you in this place; but that that makes your work the harder, is, this people being hardened under a long tract of pure goſpel ordinances. However, be fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="200" facs="unknown:030532_0199_0FE7C41E36AD8730"/>their work, they cannot, it is true, bring perſons to the Lord, but they may make their conſciences knell; they will, they ſpeak for the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Then continuing his diſcourſe to the miniſters, he ſaid, Now, brethren, give diligence; for the Lord's ſake ply your work, <hi>hold faſt what ye have.</hi> I muſt have a word to my brethren, it is on my heart; I am young, but I am near the end of my life, and that makes me old. It becomes me to take advice from you; however, it is only to exhort to diligence, in the <hi>common ſalvation.</hi> I repent I did not more, but I have peace in it, that what I did, I did it in ſincerity; he accepts of the <hi>mite.</hi> It was the delight of my heart to preach the goſpel, and it made me ſometimes neglect a frail body. I ever thought, if I could contribute to the ſaving of a ſoul, it would be a flar, a crown, and a glorious crown. I knew this was the thing I aimed at; I defired to decreaſe, that the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom might increaſe, and to be nothing, that he might all; and I rejoice in his highneſs. When one ſaid, ſo great attainments might be comfortable to him now. He replied, I lay no ſtreſs thereon; the thing I rejoice in it, that his grace enabled me to this. Well, brethren, this is encouragement to you to try and go farther. Alas, I have gone no length; but I would ſain have gone far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <hi>The hand of the diligent makes rich.</hi> Much ſtudy, much prayer, temptations alſo, and diſtinct cutgates from temptations, are uſeful helps. I was fond enough of books; but I muſt ſay, in the courſe of my miniſtry, what the Lord let me ſee of my ill heart, and what was neceſſary againſt it, was more ſteadable to me than all my books. One ſaid, that was to believe, and therefore to ſpeak. He replied, the Lord help me to honour him; I deſire no more, but to honour him here and hereafter. O that I had the tongues of men and angels to praiſe him! I hope, I hope in a little to get will to anſwer du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſkill and ability to anſwer will. O to be helped ſo, and to ſear always. One ſaid, bleſſed is he that fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth always, even under manifeſtations and diſcoveries of God; <hi>He that ſtands, let him take heed leſt be fall.</hi> He ſaid, ſobriety, ſobriety, would fall in a little, if he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw; but do not ſtumble, ſirs, though I ſhould be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, the ſoundation ſtands ſure.</p>

                     <pb n="201" facs="unknown:030532_0200_0FE7C3C01BA42818"/>
When adviſed to lie quiet a little, he ſaid, whereon ſhould a man beſtow his laſt breath, but in commending the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, God cloathed in our nature, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for our ſins? <hi>If pleaſed the Leed to bruiſe him,</hi> Sec. One ſaid, the Lord hath ſaid, <hi>I will have mercy and not ſacrifice;</hi> and preſſed him to be tender of his body. He anſwered, O but my heart is full! And then deſiring a miniſter to pray, he ſaid, pray that God may have pity on a weak thing, that is not able to bear much in the coaflict.</p>
                  <p>After prayer, when the miniſters were retiring, he ſaid, well, my brethren, mind me. I deſire to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for what I have. I do not deſire to want you long.</p>
                  <p>Thereafter, to a miniſter's wiſe he ſaid, I recommend to you the fear of the Lord; I know you have a huſband to direct you; I know you are the ſeed of the righteous; but neither of theſs will arail. Make it your buſineſs to grow in practical acquaintance with <hi>him,</hi> and encourage your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Lord: I fear the time is coming that it ſhall be ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed are the breaſts that gave no ſuch, and the womb that never bare.</hi> I fear heavy trials are haſtening on.</p>
                  <p>To two miniſters, who came from the country to viſit him, he ſaid, Brethren, I'll only ſay this, we have need to take care, with the great apoſtle, <hi>leſt when we preach Chriſt to others, we be caſt-a-ways;</hi> if it be ſo, we have need to fear; happy is the man that fears always.

Now it is like I may not be far from the concluſion of my work. As to the work of the miniſtry, it was my deliberate choice; were my days lengthened out much more, and days as

He anſwered, As to the matter of the oat, <hi>Let every one be fully perſuaded in his own mind.</hi> As theſe who are clear, ſhould guard againſt every thing that may endanger the peace of this church: So likewiſe others, who are not clear, cannot get over difficulties, and cannot in conſcience and duty comply; they are bound in conſcience not only to abſtain from ſeparating, but laboriouſly to convince their people that it ſtrikes at the root of church communion. If miniſters go on in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating courſes, the reſul of it will be, people will be taken up with the public, and forget private religion. Whoever they are that do ſo, they will have an acceſſion to this. We ſhall have people running about ſeeking to have their ears gratified, that love not the power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs: We'll get a public religion in the room of real godlineſs.

                     </gap>vil, this day, that is like to be our bane, nay, ruin and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deing, is, that there is a coldneſs and indifferency that has crept in, an untenderneſs in the courſe of our walk, that gives a great advantage to our enemies, we do not maintain the teſtimony of God in a humble tender way, in ſuch a day as this, when many are running from God. It ſeems to be a principle now with many, how far they may go and not be ruined, that is, to go to the brink of deſtruction; but the Chriſtian rule is, to ſtand at a diſtance. Now the Lord help you. Pray that I may be helped to honour God in life and death; there is much reaſon to bleſs him. O to bear it out, and ſtand the trial thankfully: O what ground of thankfulneſs have I!</p>
                  <p>To his ſucceſſor in the pariſh he was tranſported from, he ſaid, I have this to ſay, as to my congregation, that people were my choice; with much peace and pleaſure I preached as I could, though not as I ſhould, the goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt; though in all things I own myſelf to have finned exceedingly before the Lord, yet I have peace that I aimed with concern at leading them to the Lord Jeſus; and another foundation can no man lay: I hope you will build on that ſame foundation, as you will, in that way, ſave your own ſoul, ſo it is the way to ſave them that hear you. From experience I can ſay, that the purſning this ſincerely, is the way to ſalvation. Signity to them, that, if it pleaſe the Lord to take me away, I die re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing in the faith and profeſſion of what I oft preached to them under a low ſtate of body; and without this I could have no relief. I would have my folk underſtand, that that goſpel which I recommend to them, if it is not received, it will be a witneſs againſt them. His ſucceſſor ſaid, I am perſuaded you have ſeals to your miniſtry in that pariſh. He anſwered, we are like our maſter, <hi>ſet for the fall and riſing again of many.</hi> Though we can reach no more, if we are faithful, they <hi>ſhall know that a prophet has been among them.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="204" facs="unknown:030532_0203_0FE7C36B860588D0"/>
To one that came in to him, he ſaid, <hi>learn to die.</hi> It is rare to die as a Chriſtian; the moſt part think there is no more to do, but to lay down their heads and die: This is even as if one would cover his face, and leap o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a rock into the ſea.</p>
                  <p>To a gentlewoman he ſaid, I may cry, <hi>ſhame on me,</hi> and <hi>woes</hi> me, that began not ſooner, and run not faſter; for the Lord's way is as <hi>ſilver tried.</hi> We ſhould never, in matters of eternal moment, chuſe a way that we will rue of again. I will not detain you, you have your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, he will be a good friend to you; follow his advice, and ſuch perſons as he; follow their example. In a word, follow the example of Jeſus Chriſt, and be converſant with the word; be careful not only in reading the word, you may ſoon tire of that, but cry for the Spirit of the Lord, to quicken it, and then you will be with it as the child that cannot live without the breaſts. Be diligent in attending the ordinances. The Lord bleſs you. As for me, for any thing I ſee, I am dying: But I die, I bleſs his name, in the way that I have hitherto choſen delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, and I have no ground to complain. Commend me to all friends. Carry this commiſſion along, what I ſay to one, I ſay to all, Seek the Lord. And all I have to ſeek, is that I may ſtand to it.</p>
                  <p>To a private Chriſtian he ſaid, ſeek the Lord, and be real in religion, content not yourſelf with the form of it; a mere profeſſion will not do the turn; this will be but the ſhell without the kernel; but they that are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, ſhall inherit the crown. Let not the ſcorn and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt that is caſt on religion, cauſe you give up with it. 'Tis not in vain to ſeek the Lord, you have found it. The ſcriptures of truth are a contemned book by men; but they are able to make you wiſe unto ſalvation; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of caſting out with them, and throwing them by as a uſeleſs book; but converſe with them, and ye will find your account in them: All the books of the world could not have been in that ſtead, that ſince yeſterday they have been to me. Chuſe good company; bewane of ill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, hold at a diſtance from it; ſeek that God may guide you into religious company, and improve it; folk by whom ye may learn ſomething, and that without learning
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:030532_0204_0FE7C3C70E2DEDB8"/>any thing that may be hurtful. Ye have a ſad ſet of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try round about here; take heed ye be not drawn off your feet. This is a friends advice; it is meet for me, in my circumſtances eſpecially, to give, and meet for you to receive.</p>
                  <p>After a little ſtop, he ſaid, I'll only tell you one dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference there is this day between my caſe and the caſe of many in the world; the courſe I have followed weakly, has been at leaſt to join with them that are on God's ſide: Now, it is come to a puſh, and I have peace; I always wiſhed to have God for my God, and the <hi>heritage of his choſen.</hi> But they that walk contrary to God, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him, I have ſeen them frequently, when they were come to a pinch, cry then, "O ſhame upon the way I "have been in."</p>
                  <p>In the night time, to ſome preſent he ſaid, Do ye ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this growing weakneſs of my eyes? Anſ. No. He replied, Yea, but I know it is ſo; now that is a prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no. tick of a change. If he ſhut eyes, he'll open eyes, eyes no more to behold vanity: But I ſhall behold him in righteouſneſs, and when I a wake, I ſhall be ſatisfied with his likeneſs.</p>
                  <p>Thereafter he ſaid, If this be the day of the ending of my conflict, I would deſire, even humbly to ſeek of the Lord, that he would of his great mercy condeſcend to be tender to one that loves his appearance; that as he has dealt wonderfully and condeſ endingly with me, ſo he may even deal tenderly to the end, in looſing the pins of my tabernacle, and that I may be helped to honour God by a compoſed reſignation into his hand. O religion, and the glory of it, in this degenerate age, has been much on my heart; and he has ſaid, them that honour me, I will honour: I was willing through his grace to have borne reproach; if my adverſary had written a book, I would have taken and bound it as a glory.</p>
                  <p>Finding ſome ſweat on his face, he ſaid, I fancy that is an indication of a greater change. I can compoſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I bleſs his name. I wot not how it comes to paſs, that a body, that has met with ſo much of God, ſhould be ſo unthankful as in the leaſt to doubt him about the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="206" facs="unknown:030532_0205_0FE7C36D1E6474E0"/>and curſed ſelf have I. O how has God honoured me! O that I ſhould yet have ſuch an enemy in my boſom, as an <hi>evil heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He canſed read I Theſſ. i. iv. and v. chapters. And when one ſaid, Sir, I think you need to take the night's reſt; he anſwered, I have no need of any reſt, were it not to put me in caſe to <hi>finiſh my courſe with joy.</hi> Lo, what the power of Chriſt's death, and the efficacy of his reſurrection are! And now I find the advantage of one at <hi>the right band of God, who is able to ſave to the uttermoſt;</hi> and that is the ſight I long for; he will but ſhut the eyes, and open them in glory! O it is a great matter, ſirs, to believe; yet we have ſtrong grounds to believe, only we have <hi>evil hearts of unbelief.</hi> This I dare ſay, to have my ſoul intirely ſubmiſſive to God, and all things, even every high imagination and thought made ſubject, is my ſincore deſire; but I'll get that done ſhortly; then ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will there be a reluctant thought, neves an eſtranged thought more from God: <hi>Now it does not appear what we ſhall be; we ſhall be like him when he appears; for we ſhall ſee him as hi it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To one that alleged he was faint, he ſaid, I am not faintiſh, I am compoſed, and I am refreſhed, I am not drunk with wine, and yet I am refreſhed with wine, with the ſpiced wine: O there is a ſweet calm on my ſoul! And <hi>my deſires are towards him, and the remembrance of his name.</hi> Remember him! why ſhould I not remember him, that remembered me in my low condition?

                  <p>After reading of the foreſaid ſcripture, he cauſed read a Cor, i, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>—22. and after the 9th and 10th verſes were read, he ſaid; now there it is all; God has delivered, and filled me with peace, when I was under that heavy damp; and I hope that he will deliver, even from that which I ſeared in death; and let me find that I have got the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and that the God of peace will bruiſe Satan ſhortly under my feet, and he will get up no more; and I will get a victory over the cunning world, the deceitful heart. O! many a weary day I have had with my unbelief. If I had had faith to believe things not ſeen, if I had had ſaith anſwerable to the convictions I had on my ſoul, that
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:030532_0206_0FE7C3CCEE454A88"/>my happineſs lay not in things ſeen and temporal, but eternal; if I had had faith's abiding imprreſſions realizing theſe things, I would not have known how to abide out of heaven a moment.</p>
                  <p>A little thereafter he ſaid, as I preached the goſpel in my life, ſo I deſire to die preaching it; and though I live not till a ſuffering time, I may get in among the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. Sirs, I will be a witneſs againſt St. Andrews. I will be a witneſs againſt the profeſſors that are come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout me, if they follow not the Lord.</p>
                  <p>When deſired to lie quiet and take ſleep, he anſwered, the folk I am going to, <hi>ſleep not day nor night, but cry, holy, holy, holy. They that wait on the Lord ſhall mount up as with eagles wings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then he ſaid, find ye any alteration as to my coldneſs? the only reaſon why I aſk, is, I would not loſe my time.</p>
                  <p>Ah, poor blacked I, that think ſhame to come in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong that fair company. One ſaid, you will be as fine as the reſt. He ſaid, bleſſings to his name, for compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. I cannot get my heart in a right tune, as I would have it, but within a little I will get it ſo.</p>
                  <p>After he had lien quiet a little, one ſaid, you have ſleeped none. He anſwered, no, I had much work, but bleſſed be God, pleaſant work.</p>
                  <p>Thereafter, when his wife aſked how he was, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, my dear, I am longing for the ſalvation of my God, and haſtening to it. Then ſeeing her very ſad, he ſaid, my dear, encourage yourſelf; here is a body going to clay, and a ſoul going to heaven, where I hope you are to come.</p>
                  <p>September 19, about five in the morning, when he was deſired to lie quiet, and try if he could reſt, he anſwered, no, no; ſhould I lie here altogether uſeleſs? ſhould not I ſpend the laſt bit of my ſtrength, to ſhew forth his glory? he held up his hands, and ſaid, lame hands, and lame legs, (his hands and legs were greatly ſwelled), but ſee a <hi>lame man leaping and rejoicing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Speaking of his children to his wife, he ſaid, they are all a devoted thing to the Lord; and I can ſay, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when they were baptized, that the Lord helped me to devote them to him, and hade me bring the reſt and he would accept of them.</p>

Thereafter, finding ſome diſorder in his body, he ſaid, this is juſt one of the forerunners of the charge, the great change.

                  <p>To a miniſter that came in, he ſaid, your ſervant, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I am upon a piece of trying work; I am parting with wife and bairns. Reſolve on that, I bleſs his name, though I have had one of the beſt of wives, yet ſhe is no more mine, but the Lord's.</p>
                  <p>Then to his children he ſaid, now von are fatherleſs; your father is to be taken from you: Eur ſeek God. And now I got you from the Lord, and I give you to him. Now I leave you upon him; you are no more mine.</p>
                  <p>To his ſon he ſaid, <hi>God bleſs the lad,</hi> and let my name he named upon him. But O! what is my name! Let the <hi>name of the Lord be named</hi> upon him. I do not ſay, keep up my name; but O! that you may be honoured to tell the generation following, how good God is, and hand down the teſtimony. And O that ye may be all the Lord's.</p>
                  <p>After that he ſpoke to his ſervants, and ſaid, as for you, my ſervants, that have been in my family, my dear friends, make religion your main buſineſs, and mind that above all things.

                  <p>Then exhorting ſome to think on death, he ſaid, to mind death is a pioſitable thing: To mind death is not to go church yards and viſit tombs; but it lies in this, to be habitually under the impreſſions of death, in its riſe and cauſe, in its preſent ſtate and relation to both covenants, the various iſſues and conſequences of it, and the way of delivery from it, and all the circumſtances attending it.</p>
                  <p>Then as to his ſpiritual enemies, he ſaid, But I think. I am now almoſt out of their hands. One ſaid, that is a great victory. He anſwered, I dare not ſpeak of victory; but he holds me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>urſed enemy, <hi>viz.</hi> ſelf, lie at the door to catch: for when I had the greateſt advantages, I have felt corruption ſtirring and making no ſmall difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, inclining me to ſpoil my Lord of his glory. One ſaid, we ſhall neither under mercies nor afflictions be free of this trial. He ſaid, O ſtrange, that when death has been ſo lo g kept in view, that it ſhould be ſo! One ſaid, you have reaſon to count that a victory, that the Lord has helped you over your late ſears: You know what a damp you was under on Wedneſday, and what a ſweet outgate you got. He anſwered, I deſire to bleſs his name for it; but I ſhould be yet under as great a damp, if he ſhould withdraw: Holy ſe..r, caution and jealouſy, is ſtill needful.</p>
                  <p>After that, to the miniſters he ſaid, brethren, you are there: In caſe I ſhould be ſurpriſed, I take this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to acknowledge your tenderneſs to me, that I am moſt unworthy of it in many reſpects: I can ſay, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to live in love with you and I bleſs God there was

The Lord bleſs you and your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, the Lord himſelf multiply ſpiritual bleffings on you and your families, ſupport you againſt diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and the Lord in mercy look on the riſing genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the Lord hold his hands about the ſeminaries in this place, God look with pity on them. Then to one be ſaid, My dear brother, who has been my comfort in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, ſtand your ground, quit yourſelt like a man, be ſtrong. Now ſir, now my dear friend, I ſhall only ſay, as I wiſh you the bleſſing of God on your family, ſo I deſire that you will even ſhew kindneſs to the dead, in ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with all hindneſs to my dear wife and children: I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend her to your care; ſhe has been the friend of my boſom, the wiſe of my youth, a faithful friend. And turning to all the miniſters preſent, O ſirs, check my poor babies, if ye ſee any thing in them diſorderly: I have lent and devoted them to the Lord. Laſt ſpring the Lord has taken trial of it, (by this he meant the death of his ſon George), and has taken me at my word. O ſirs, it is an evidence of the decay of religion, that ſympathy and love among the ſaints is decayed: O if the Spirit were poured out from high I. Then he ſaid, pray firs, pray for grace: I would have the praiſe of the victory to him.</p>
                  <p>Afterward he ſaid, patience muſt have its perfect work; I will wait for it: My ſoul longs more than they that wait for the morning. Sweet Lord Jeſus, make haſte, <hi>until the day break and the ſhadows ſlic away.</hi> Then to a miniſter he ſaid, pray a word for patience to me to bide this laſt trial.</p>
                  <p>Thereafter, at his deſire, a large paper was read over to him, which he had dictated ſome days before, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a teſtimony unto religion, and advice to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, which being read, he owned before ſeveral wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, that he had dictated the ſame; and deſired that theſe, as his words, might be atteſted by them; the tenor whereof follows:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter">
                     <body>
                        <p>HAVING, in another paper apart, made ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of my worldly concerns, as I thought moſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for my family, I did think myſelf bound moreover, by this preſent teſtament and latter will, to declare my ſentiments and ſenſe as to religion; being hitherto, thio'
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:030532_0211_0FE7C379CDADA1F8"/>the mercy of God, in the full and compoſed exerciſe of any reaſon and judgment that God has given me, though: otherwiſe very trail in body: And this I am the rather inclined to, as a teſtimony againſt the growing apoſtacy of the day we live in, and in expreſſion of my earneſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to have all with whom I have any influence or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to adhere to the truth and way of God, in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that general inclination to apoſſacy, in principle and practice, that prevails at this day.</p>
                        <p>In the firſt place then, I do ingenuouſly acknowledge, that I came into the world a defiled, polluted branch of apoſtate Adam, under the guilt of his ſin, tainted with the pollution of ſin derived from him; having a heart full of alienation from, and enmity againſt God; in a word, a <hi>child of wrath, and heir of bell.</hi> And long did I follow the bent of this corrupt nature, going on, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding reclaiming means of all forts, from evil to worſe, though mereifully reſtrained from thoſe more open ſcandals, that bring reproach before the world: In a word, I had ruined myſelf, and could do nothing for my own recovery, and muſt have been everlaſtingly ruined in this caſe, if the Lord, in tender mercy, had not looked upon me.</p>
                        <p>I muſt, on the other hand, and the Lord knows I do it with much cheerfulneſs of heart, bleſs the Lord, who calt my lot in a land where the goſpel of Chriſt, and the way of ſalvation by him, is clearly, plainly, and purely revealed and preached, wherein the pure ordinances of God's worſhip, without the mixture of men's inventions, have through the mercy of God been kept up, and the beautiful order of his houſe maintained, according to the rule of his word. I bleſs the Lord that he ſo order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, that I was born in a religious family of godly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and that I had this to ſay, that God was my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's God, and that I had been earneſtly and ſeriouſly by them devoted to him: And whereas I early ſubjected myſelf to other lords in my childhood and youth, I bleſs and adore the Lord, that by his word and Spirit, he ceaſed not to be a reprover, reclaimer, and to ſtrive with me, until, by a day of power, he made me cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully give up with thoſe abominations, and return to the
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:030532_0212_0FE7C3D5CA0DEDC8"/>God of my fathers. Long did I ſtruggle againſt the Lord's work, but, praiſes to free grace, he proved ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than I, and overcame me, and I rejoice in his high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                        <p>I bleſs the Lord, though by many provocations of all forts, I hare given him juſt ground to abandon me quite, yet he has not ſo done; nay, even when I was as a beaſt before him, he held me by the hand, and left me not to run away. O aſtoniſhing, ſovereigaty of grace! I bleſs the Lord, that when I ſtood trembling under the tetrors of God's law, he ſeaſonably ſaved me from deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, by ſome diſcovery of the bleſſed way of ſalvation for ſelf deſtroyed ſinners, through a ſlain Saviour; even ſuch a diſcovery, as made me reſolve to part with all, that I might have the <hi>field,</hi> Chriſt the treaſure hid in it, and <hi>pearl of price.</hi> There is nothing I dread ſo much as a miſtake in this matter; it is Chriſt only that will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer me and my caſe; and without him I am undone; on him, the efficacy of his ſufferings, the power of his reſurrection, and of his whole mediation as revealed in the goſpel, do I build all my hope.</p>
                        <p>I bleſs the Lord, that ever he honoured ſuch a ſinful unworthy worm, to preach the glorious goſpel of his Son: I confeſs I have but ill managed this glorious truſt; and my manifold corruptions made me a ſinner in all I did, exceedingly; yet ſo far us I do know my own heart, it was the life of my life to <hi>preach Chriſt crucified,</hi> and deal with conſciences about accepting of him; nor durſt I deal coldly or indifferently, in a matter wherein I knew my own and hearer's ſalvation to eternity did depend. Herein this day I have peace, and I know that in this matter I ſhall never have ground of regret. I muſt bear my honourable maſter that teſtimony, that he never bid me go any part of my warfare upon my own charges; if I was ſtraitened it was in my own <hi>bowels;</hi> as to him I always found, "ſpend and have in his ſervice, was the beſt thriſt;" when I was helped freely to give what free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I had received, I never wanted then <hi>ſeed</hi> for ſowing, and <hi>bread</hi> for the eater, and I hope ſometimes a <hi>bleſſing.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I bleſs God, that he has caſt an inſignificant worm's lot among thoſe to whom his weak labours were not: unaccept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:030532_0213_0FE7C37BDF58DB48"/>and I look upon it as a high privilege to have the countenance of the ſaints, the <hi>excellent o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>I bleſs the Lord, that I have been happily tryſted in the ſeveral places wherein I lived, with kind, affectionate, uſeful fathers and brethren to me, with whom I have liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with much delight and ſatisfaction, and for whom I bleſs the Lord heartily.</p>
                        <p>In a word, I deſire to join my inſigniſicant teſtimony unto that of the glorious cloud of witneſſes; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly I do atteſt, as my fixed perſuaſion, that Chriſt only has the <hi>words of eternal life;</hi> that the <hi>goſpel</hi> only has <hi>brought life and immortality to light;</hi> that this bleſt revelation is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>to make wiſe to ſalvation every one that believeth.</hi> I muſt bear a teſtimony, that the way of holineſs is the way of peace, and the way of pleaſantneſs, and that goſpel ordinances, in their native ſimplicity and purity, are bleſted and effectual means of communion and <hi>fellowſhip with the Father and with the Son.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I ſee a generation, that has loſt long ago any thing of the power of religion ſome of them once ſeemed to have, haſtening faſt to an utter rejection of the purity of goſpel-ordinances, and ſtrongly inclined to ſubſtitute in their room that dead careaſe of forms, ceremonies, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions, which England at her reformation, regarding po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical conſiderations more than the rule of church retor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, retained to the unſpeakable prejudice of ſouls, and to the endangering one day or other, the whole of the Chriſtian religion there; it being viſible, that among thoſe who adhere to them, the power of religion is ſtill wearing lower and lower: and nothing could induce this generation to the change, but their utterignorance of the power of religion; and ſomething men muſt have. It is obvious, the change is net of God; the lives of the zealots for it demonſtrate this, with the oppoſition made by them unto ſerious godlineſs, and the encouragement given unto proſane perſons, if they will but join with
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:030532_0214_0FE7C3DB83D913B0"/>them in this party-deſign. In a word, my ſenſe of it is, that it flows from the want of a ſenſe of the ſpirituality that God requires in his worſhip, and is likly to iſſue in the loſs of all religion. Such as now caſt at the purity and ſimplicity of religion, and put forms in its room, are likely, are long, as we have ſeen inſtances, to ſet the form a packing too.</p>
                        <p>In a word, all in God's way, in his word, is glorious, honourable, and like himſelf, he needs none of cur teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonies; but it is the leaſt than we can do, to ſignify our good will to have his praiſes celebrated; and I, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo many ways obliged, take this ſolemn occaſion to acknowledge, before I leave the world, theſe among the innumetable other obligations, and deſire to bequeath this, as my beſt legacy to my family, even my ſerious and ſolemn advice, to make <hi>choice of God for their God;</hi> he has been my father's God, the God both of my wife's predeceſſors and mine; he has been, we hope, our God; and I recommend him to my children for their God, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly charging thein, as they will be anſwerable in the great day, all of them, to make it their firſt care to ſeek after peace with God, and reconciliation through Chriſt cruciſied; and being reconciled, make it their perpetual ſtudy to pleaſe him in all things. I beſeech them, with all the bowels of a father, as they love their ſouls, ſit not down ſhort of ſaving acquaintance with him, wait dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently upon the means of grace, and attend the worſhip of God in all duties, ſecret eſpecially, family likewiſe, and carefully attend public ordinances; beware of content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yourſelves with the more form of theſe duties, but cry to the Lord for communion with him in them, and the our-pouring of his Spirit, whereby you may be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to <hi>worſhip God,</hi> who is a ſpirit, <hi>in ſpirit.</hi> It is my charge to you, and that which I am above all things rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to you concerned in, that ye follow God; follow him early, follow him fully, without turning aſide to the right or left hand. In this way, I dare promiſe you bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs; if ye follow this way, I bleſs you all, and pray that <hi>be who bleſſes,</hi> and they are bleſſed, <hi>may bleſs you all.</hi> I have oft devoted, as I could, all of you to God; and there is nothing I have ſo much at heart, as to have this

O that God himſelf, by his grace, may in a day of his power, determine your tender hearts to ſeek him early, and he will be a good portion, and ſee well to you; <hi>your bread ſhall be given you, and your water ſhall be ſure;</hi> neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties you ſhall have, and a bleſſing; though you have not many blood relations, ye ſhall not want a friend every where, and that a ſteadable friend.

                        <p>I leave this one advice more to my family, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we have a proſpect of divided times, and different ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions and practices among miniſters and people, purticularly about this oath of abjuration, beware of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting yourſelves in that difference, or entertaining pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices againſt miniſters upon the one hand or the other; there will be faithful miniſters on both ſides, and on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand they will act according to their light fincerely; whoever ſhall have an acceſſion to the weakening any of their hands, will find no peace in it, in the cloſe of the day; beware of a religion that is moſt taken up about public matters.

I am ſober and compoſed, if ever I was ſober. And <hi>whether men will hear, or whether they will forbear,</hi> this is a teſtimony.

Well, ſirs, ye will meet with difficulties and diſcouragements; but this may encourage you, ye ſee God owns his ſervants, and ſhould not his ſervants own him, and rejoice in him, and deſpiſe what enemies can do, when the maſter does ſo much for them? God has kept my head to me, and my judgment, for the beſt piece of work that ever I had. Bleſſed be God, my head and my heart are ſo ſound. Though many a time, a vain heart has run away, and carried me down the ſtream, yet I may ſay, the habitually determinate deſires of my ſoul, from the day that God firſt <hi>revealed his Son in me,</hi> run out after him, and the remembrance of his name. And now I find he meets them that rejoice, and work righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; glory, glory to him. O what of God I ſee! I never ſaw any thing like it.

When a miniſter ſaid, Do you deſire one of us to pray? He anſwered, Yea, yea, pray that I may win comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably over. One ſaid, He has need of ſome refreſhment. He anſwered, I have meat to eat. Pray, ſaid he, that, like a good ſoldier, I may ſtrike the laſt ſtroke.</p>

                  <p>After that he ſaid, Come Lord Jeſus; I have waited for thy ſal ation.—I wait for thy ſalvation, as the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man watcheth for the morning.—I am weary with delays. —I faint for thy ſalvation.—Why are his chariot wheels ſo long a coming?—He is trying, my patience—he is try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my patience.

                  <p>Then having revived a little, he ſaid, Draw the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains about me, and let me ſee what he has a mind to do with me. This done, after a while's ſilence, he ſaid, <hi>Whence is this to me?</hi> There is a ſtrange change within this half hour. Ah, ſaid he, I am like to be ſhip-wrecked to health again; I am afraid for it, and tremble at this, ſirs. O what ſort of providence is this? I was in hopes to have been at the end of my journey; and now I am detained with a croſs wind. I deſire to be patient under his hand; but he muſt open my heart to glorify him.

                  <p>After that he ſaid, <hi>I have loved the habitation of thy houſe, and the place where thy honour dwells. Thou that knoweſt all things, knows I love thee.</hi> Lord, I may not want thee.</p>
                  <p>Then to the miniſters he ſaid. Brethren, go and pray to the Lord for me. One ſaid, Brother, I am not diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in that reviving you got.

                  <p>Thereafter he ſaid, O that I could bleſs the Lord, ſuch a wonder of mercy as I have been made. When he was

He anſwered, His loving kindneſs is indeed marvellous to me, <hi>What am I, O what am I, that he has brought me hitherto!</hi> What I have is not a flaſhy and very ſenſible joy; yet I bleſs, I bleſs his name I am much compoſed, and having ſolid clear ſcripture manifeſtations of God, and the things of God.</p>
                  <p>To the apothecary he ſaid, I thought to have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and I am come back again: I am glad to be gone, not that I am wearied: He has not allowed a fretting thought to vex me. O I am a monument, a monument of the power of God. My trouble is great, but I am helped to bear it: And in ſo far I am a martyr as well as a witneſs. My great deſire has been theſe many years, to ſuffer for the truth of our religion; and now God has given me the greateſt honour, to be a living witneſs to it, and a monument of it, that <hi>we have not followed cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly deviſed fables.</hi> I will be at heaven ſhortly; I will come there by the word of my teſtimony, and the blood of the Lamb: All is of grace: He has choſen me, called me, juſtified me, and ſanctified me by his grace. <hi>He gives grace and glory,</hi> theſe are brave gifts.</p>

If the Lord give ſuch ſupport, and continue me years in this, I have no reaſon to complain. One ſaid, No hypocrite is able to counterfeit that language in ſuch a caſe as you are in. He anſwered, It is as great a wonder to me, as to any about me. Brother, I know not whether I may not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you to beg of the Lord, with reſpect to your body, even to pity and to ſhorten, if it be his will, my trial; the hireling longs for his wages; but I have rerſon to do it with ſubmiſſion.</p>
                  <p>Thereafter he ſaid, My body has got ſuch a hurt, that I believe I will ſcarce recover it; and that is the thing that keeps all my body in a fire. The panting for want of breath is over; but O it is the mercy of God that keeps me compoſed. This trouble of my bowels draws my ſtomach and all together as if it were with cords: And yet I muſt ſay, <hi>What am I, and what is my father's houſe, that God b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="237" facs="unknown:030532_0236_0FE7C401DD24CCD8"/>One ſaid, Corruption will temain while in the body. He anſwered, But I long to be away, to get a deliverance. One ſaid, In doe time that will come. Then he ſaid, I am lying here, and the Lord helps me to wait for that conſolation that is in Chriſt, that will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>To the miniſter he ſaid, The Lord has been ſtill with me. I am carnal, but I long for a deliverance from the remainders of a body of ſin. I long for a deliverance from this trouble; if God lengthen it out, if he give me more troubles, then why not, righteous is his name. I know not what alteration may be. I long indeed for a ſhare of that everlaſting reſt; and I confeſs I am like a bird on the wing, and I would fain be at Immanuel's land, where the tree of life is. Well, all this is encouragement to you to acquaint yourſelf with God; you ſee religion is advantageous; <hi>great is the gain of gallizeſs.</hi> All theſe ſoft clothes are like ſacking about me; and yet I have perfect caſe of ſpirit. My breaſt is drawing together, as ſore as it were with cords; and ſtill the Lord keeps compoſure. What is this! I could have ſcarce believed, though I had been told it, that I could have been kept in the right ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of my judgment under this racking pain. The drawing of the breaſt ſeems to me to be, as if I were all hung together, all pulled together: So that I would make that improve ent, whatever comes of it, I am ſure I am a demonſtration that there is a reality in religion; and I rejoice in this, that God has honoured a ſinful worm, ſo as to be a demonitration of his grace. I am preaching the goſpel. I have a diſpenſation committed to me, ſhame belongs to me; I am a ſinner, the praiſe of all belongs to him; <hi>worthy is the Lamb, to receive glory.</hi> I hope I ſhall ſhortly be at that glory I have been long expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: though I come not near Mr. Shield's glory, nor Mr. Anderſon's, &amp;c. Only, O if I were in, I will be well enough, I will be well enough when I win in. Dear friends about me, take the commendation off my hand; while I live I muſt preach the goſpel: He has given me a while yet here, that ſhould be reckoned precious, and I
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:030532_0237_0FE7C3AA10D0EE80"/>reckon it ſhould be my work ſtill to commend him. The word ſoeaks, providence ſpeaks in me; and if there be a deſpiſing of the goſpel under this new diſcovery, take heed, it will ſtill make it the worſe with you. Glory to him that ever he revealed himſelf in me! be is free in his love. I was <hi>wallowing</hi> in my <hi>blood;</hi> but he <hi>faſt by,</hi> and <hi>caſt his ſkirt</hi> over me; like the kindly mother to the bairn, at firſt it behoved to be cleanſed and ſwaddled, and again cleanſed after that it is puddled; ſo I will be to cleanſe to the end.</p>
                  <p>To two miniſters that tarried with him, when the resſt went to the church, be ſaid, I would deſire a word read, and prayer, and if my head would endure, I would fain hear ſinging. I do not now find any change, but there may be; and I am the leſs concerned, becauſe the Lord in ſome meaſure has taken away that inclination to limit him as to the hour; though ye may be ſure the hireling longs for his wages. He cauſed read Pſalm lxxxiv. and ſing the latter part of it, and pray: And after prayer, he having joined in ſinging, ſaid, I had always a miſtuned voice, a bad ear, bat which is worſt of all, a miſtuned heart; but ſhortly, when I Join the temple ſervice above, there ſhall not be, world without end, one ſtring of the affections out of tune. And after that, he cauſed one of the miniſters read to him, what Doctor Owen had ſaid of this temple ſervice above, in his book on the perſon of Chriſt; often this day did he bloſs God be had been help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give ſuch a teſtimony to God's ways.</p>
                  <p>To ſome that came from church, he ſaid, You have been in the aſſembly of God's people, the deſirable aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly wherein communion and fellowſhip with the Father and Son may be attained; and all theſe enjoyments are among the moſt valuable to be had here, and they are the way to the reft, which remains for the people of God: But O! to be joined with the company above.

To a gentlewoman he ſaid, You are come to ſee your old dying friend, a wonder indeed, but a wonder of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: I have preached from the pulpit, but now I am preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a death-bed; and I would be conrent, if ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble preſence were continued, to ſpeak till fleſh and bones were waſhen and waſted to nothing.

Follow me, take my word for it, he is a good matter, ye will never rue the ſervice; and I am well hired to it. He took a little rattle in his throat, and ſaid, This may be irkſome to you; but every meſſenger of death is pleaſant to me, and I am only detained here, that I may trumpet forth his praiſe a little longer.</p>

                  <p>He broke out in frequent admiration with the greateſt warmneſs at what he ſelt: Strange, ſaid he, this body is waſhing away to corruption, and yet my intellectuals are ſo lively, that I cannot ſay there is the leaſt alteration, the leaſt decay of judgment or memory; ſuch vigorous actings of my ſpirit towards God, and things that are <hi>not ſeen!</hi> but, ſaid he, <hi>Not I, not I, but the grace of God in me.

                  <p>When he revived, after a ſevere ſhock, he ſaid, I am defeat; and added, I am ſhipwrecked into health again. One ſaid, But you have ſtill a pleaſant view of an end of all your pain and trouble in that land, <hi>where the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſhall not ſay he is ſick.</hi> At which he gave pleaſant looks and ſmiles, and turned up his eyes and hands while he was not able to ſpeak.</p>
                  <p>One ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed are they that die in the Lord;</hi> there is much that goes before, along with, and after it. <hi>We groan in this tabernacle, being burdened,</hi> not ſimply that we would be diſſolved, but <hi>clothed upon with our houſe which is from heaven.</hi> Then he ſaid, when I fall ſo low that I am not able to ſpeak, I will ſhew you a ſign of triumph when I am near glory, if I be able.</p>
                  <p>Then he was for a while very low, he ſwooned, and thereafter, as prayer was ended, he revived a little. One ſaid, Had you no trouble? He anſwered, No, I know
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:030532_0250_0FE7C42CF1EF0908"/>not where I was; I know nothing about it. Yea, yea, <hi>he can do no iniquity.</hi> It is meet there ſhould be a trial. I am wonderfully helped, beyond the power of nature. If my mouth be not wet every moment, it is as hot as fire.</p>
                  <p>Then he ſaid, The conflict is pretty long, but bleſſed be he that gives patience. I am mightily ſpent. One ſaid, Shall we pray a ſhort word? He anſwered, Yes.</p>

                  <p>To his wiſe he ſaid, My dear, be not diſcouraged, tho' I ſhould go away in a fainting ſit, the Lord's way is the beſt way; and I am compoſed.</p>
                  <p>To ſome others he ſaid, You need not be diſcouraged, ſirs; what if I ſhould go away with a fit of vomiting or fainting, it is all one. I did not know whether I was up or down.</p>
                  <p>After that he ſaid, though my body be ſufficiently teaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Yet my ſpirit is untouched.</p>
                  <p>One ſaid, You ſeem to be near the crown that you have been wreſtling ſo long for. He cried, free grace, free grace, not unto me. Speaking of his body, he ſaid, Why ſhould it not go to duſt?</p>
                  <p>One ſaid, You have been crying much to God that he would be with you; and I doubt not but you are find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it now. He ſaid, Yes. One ſaid, Now you are putting your ſeal to that truth, that great is the gain of godlineſs. He anſwered, Yes indeed. One ſaid, And I hope your are encouraging yourſelf in the Lord. As a ſign of it he lifted up his hands and clapped them, when he could not ſpeak.</p>
