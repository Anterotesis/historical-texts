            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE Inhabitants Of the Province of the Massachusets-Bay, In NEW-ENGLAND.</head>
            <p>THAT this Colony was happy as to Civil Government whilst they Enjoyed their <hi>Former Charter,</hi> is most certain. Not that that there where no imperfections attending that First Patent. Our Neighbours in the other Colonies saw that there were some material Defects therein, which are not in their Charters, that were Granted after <hi>Ours.</hi> But inasmuch as by Vertue thereof, the Freeman had full Power to Chuse their own Rulers, they could not be Miserable, unless by unhappy <hi>Elections</hi> they made themselves so.</p>
            <p>That some great Priviledges contained in the <hi>Old Charter,</hi> are not in that which at Present we enjoy, is known to every one: Nevertheless there is that in it which calls for great Thankfulness to God, whose Providence has Smiled as well as Frowned upon us. By Vertue of this Charter every <gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 letter">

And (which is a greater matter) you are for ever delivered from all Impositions on <hi>Conscience,</hi> which not many years ago you were afraid of. You may serve God with all the <hi>freedom</hi> which your hearts can desire. Nor can there be any <hi>Judge</hi> or <hi>Justice of Peace,</hi> but such as the <hi>Counsellors</hi> who are to assist the Governour shall consent unto.

The Letter bears Date, <hi>October</hi> 17<hi>th.</hi> 1691.

As He is Instructed in the School of Heaven to Minister in the affairs of the Soul, so He is furnished with a Talent to transact affairs of state. His Proceedings have been with that Caution and Circumspection as is Correspondent to the weight of His Commission. He with Courage and Constancy has pursued the Noble Scope of his Employment, and understanding the true moment of things has preferred the Publick Good to the vain conceits of some, that more might be obtained if Peremptorily insisted on. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the open opposition and secret arts that have been used to frustrate the best Endeavours for the Interest of</hi> New-England, <hi>the happy Issue of things is supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to our Expectations.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>I have not for above Twelve Months troubled you with any of my Letters, because I knew my Worthy Friend,</hi> Mr. Mather, <hi>did not omit any opportunity of acquainting you with every thing wherein your Interest was concerned. I shall not much inlarge upon the Services that Mr.</hi> Mather <hi>hath done, for you have His True Character sent you by the Reverend Dr.</hi> Bates, <hi>and other the most Eminent Ministers in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this Town. But I am sure He has been Faithful to your Interests, and diligent, and unwearyed in your service, with neglect of his Health. He hath lived here for</hi> You, <hi>and deserveth the greatest Marks of your Favour you can bestow on him.</hi> Mr. Mather <hi>and My self in Transacting your affairs did not leave any way un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attempted that the wisest Friends we could consult with, could direct us to. When the King was Petitioned to make alterations in your Settlement, and to appoint a Governour, and other General Officers, we then joyned all our interests together, and obtained the Naming of every one of them, and other Priviledges that are not grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to any other Plantation. None have been more industrious by all possible means then Mr.</hi> Mather, <hi>and My self to have obtained your</hi> Old Charter. <hi>I hope Mr.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>will do me that justice, to assure you, that I have never omitted any opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of serving you to the utmost of my Power.</hi> Thus that Worthy Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman.</p>
            <p>I must now do Him that Right He expects from Me, before all the World And as I have elsewhere said, I say again, it is not in the Power of <hi>New-England</hi> duely to Reward his Endeavours. But to requite him with Censures, will not be only <hi>Vlle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Ingratitude</hi> (the C<hi>ompendium</hi> of all Evil) but great <hi>Folly</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:000659_0005_0FA9A091D8F6EA38"/>
You cannot loose <hi>His</hi> Friendship alone: and who will ever make an Interest for you again, if He must be rewarded with <hi>Slanders</hi> for all His Care and Pains? By such things you may soon make yourselves <hi>Friendless,</hi> and the most miserable people in the World. Some Friends of mine in <hi>England</hi> who were very willing I should spend the remainder of My days amongst them, told me, that they had bin informed that the People of <hi>New-England were always ungrateful to their Publick Servants,</hi> &amp; that altho' they knew I had with Industry &amp; Fidelity served them to the utmost of my Capacity, they doubted, whether they would be sensible of it, or no. My reply to them was, that (with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Permission) I would go to <hi>N. Engl.</hi> &amp; see, and if I found their prognosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations true, I should see (the dear people in <hi>Boston</hi> concurring with me) my Call clear to return to <hi>England</hi> again. And now I cannot understand but that the Inhabitants of the Province do generally rejoyce in what they at present enjoy. And their Representatives did (the last year) not only thank me, but were so civil as to propose a <hi>Reward</hi> for the service I had done for them, which I was not free to except, being desirous to convince my Country that (as the Apostle said to his C<hi>orinthians</hi>) <hi>I have sought them not theirs.</hi> And that I expect my Reward in another World. Nevertheless inasmuch as there are <hi>some</hi> (a few are to many) ill Spirits who make it their design, by Slanders to disaffect others, I have complyed with the advice of those who perswaded to the Publishing these things that so Credulous persons may not be imposed on by the invented stories of a few Whisperers. I Remember that at My departure from <hi>London,</hi> taking my leave of a Noble Personage, and Craving His Lordships Advice what might be said to satisfy the People of <hi>New-England,</hi> now they were deprived of so great a Priviledge as that of Chusing their own Governour, His Reply to Me was.</p>
            <p>If they will be Dissatisfyed, it is Impossible that they should be Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfyed at <hi>You,</hi> for Mankind knows that <hi>You</hi> did all that you could to obtain that and all other Priviledges which themselves can wish for. But were I in Your Case, at my Return to <hi>New-England,</hi> I would say to them, <hi>Gentlemen, I have brought to</hi> You, <hi>the Best</hi> Charter <hi>I could get for you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'Tis in</hi> Your <hi>Power, whether you will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of it or no; If you like it not you may if you please send it back to the King, and send over a more Fortunate Agent!</hi> And let them Try (said my Lord) whether they can find a man in all <hi>New-England</hi> that can get a <hi>better Charter</hi> for them, than you have obtained.</p>
            <p>The true and plain State of the Case was this: The Colony lay a Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for want of a Settlement as to Civil Government. The General Court had in an Adress to the King, signified, <hi>That the former Governour and Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants did not think it safe, to Enter on the full Exercise of their Old Charter Govern <gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>

               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:000659_0006_0FA9A091ED1CD7E8"/>
gland, <hi>there should be an Orderly Settlement.</hi> The Agents had no <hi>Instruction,</hi> from their Principals not to submit unto whatever Settlement should in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> be concluded best for them. So that if they had refused what was offered, they could not have answered their so doing. It is an Old Proverb, That <hi>half a</hi> L<hi>oaf is better than no Bread.</hi> And I must confess I am not of their Opinion, who if they cannot have <hi>every thing</hi> they desire, they will have <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> who prefer their <hi>Late Bondage</hi> to their <hi>present Liberty;</hi> who if they must have a <hi>Governour</hi> Set over them by the King, had rather have a <hi>bad</hi> than a <hi>good</hi> man for such Reasons as I am not willing to mention.</p>
            <p>The Lord pardon their Folly. And <hi>O my Soul come not thou into their</hi> S<hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, unto their Assembly be not thou United.</hi> If after I have done my utmost to Serve you, my Sollicitudes, and the Difficulties that I have gone thro' for your sakes, must have a Requital with that which is known in <hi>New England,</hi> by the Infamous Name of <hi>Country</hi>-P<hi>ay,</hi> I trust the Grace of God will keep me from being too sensible of it. I am not Conscious to my self of any hurt or wrong I have done, unless four years hard Service, for the preservation of your Liberty and Property, and the procuring of Gifts for you, from Royal and from other Benefactors of greater value than all the Mony I did in that Time Expend on your account<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all this without any the least Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence be a wrong to you. <hi>Forgive me that wrong.</hi> You are at this day saved from Slavery and Ruine. Whoever has been the Instruments of obtaining such Mercy for you, certainly you will neither please <hi>God</hi> nor Honour <hi>your selves</hi> by abusing them. However you deal with <hi>Me,</hi> be not unkind to <hi>others,</hi> who have deserved well at your Hands. Neither Lessen <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>Royal</hi> Favours bestowed on you. I pray God it may never be worse with you as to Civil Government then it is at present, and then you will be in that respect, as happy a people as any on the Face of the whole Earth at this Day.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Sermon</hi> herewith Emitted, cause <hi>Praises</hi> to that God who has Restored <hi>Counsellors as at the Beginning;</hi> &amp; Prayers for the continuance of so <hi>great a Blessing;</hi> My Design in granting the importunate Desires of many for its Publication, will be attained. The Lord has Tryed <hi>New-England</hi> with Signal Favours once more, having put them into the hands of Rulers that seeks their Welfare; and He waits to see whether they will be Thanful, and shew themselves fit for the continuance of so great a Blessing, but if instead of that fruit which he expects from such a people, there shall be found amongst them many <hi>Murmurers</hi> against God and his Servants, there is no reason to think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, but that He will very speedily change the Tenour of his Dispensations towards us, which I Implore the Mercy of Heaven to prevent.</p>

            <p>WHEN <hi>Austin</hi> sent to <hi>Ambrose,</hi> craving his Advice what part of the Scripture he should especially Read, He Commended the Prophet Isaiah to him. He conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Prophesying a very long time; to be sure above Sixty (some think above Fourscore) years.</p>
            <p>In his Publick Ministry, he never spared any unto whom he was sent to Deliver Messages in the Name of the Lord. His Style is not only Heroick and Majestical, becoming a Magnanimous Spirit, but very Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical. Whence some of the Ancients have called him <hi>the Fifth Evangelist,</hi> and the <hi>Apostle of the Old Testament.</hi> His Divine sayings (some or other of them) are Quoted no less than Sixty Times in the New-<hi>Testament.</hi> The usual Method observed by him in his Sermons, is with Awful Severity to threaten Judgments on the Impenitent, and to Predict and Promise mercy to the truly Penitent. And so He does in this Text and Context.</p>
            <p>In the preceding Verse the Lord by the Prophet declares that the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inflicted on his People should be Sanctified to their Reformation. He would Turn his Hand upon them, not in Wrath but in Mercy, so as purely to <hi>Purge away their Dross.</hi> This Verse is a farther Confirmation of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000659_0008_0FA9A0937281C388"/>
that Prediction, wherein there are Two Great Blessings promised to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>Judges,</hi> i.e. Chief Magistrates <hi>should be Restored to them as at the first.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was necessary in Order to their being a Reformed People. For it was by means of the profaness of their Princes, that the City and Nation was Corrupted. Nor could a National Reformation be expected until such time as the great ones therein should have their hearts sett for Religion, and Righteousness.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Lord does here promise His People that they shall have <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellours as at the beginning.</hi> For altho' the Chief Magistrate should be for Reformation and Holiness, if his <hi>Counsellours</hi> be not so too, little good can be expected, therefore both are promised as a Singular Favour of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> The Doctrine before us to be insisted on, as suitable to the present Occasion. <hi>Is,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Primitive Counsellours are a singular Mercy and Blessing of God to His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Doctrine may be Confirmed in Three <hi>Propositions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Proposition. I. <hi>Good Counsellours are the Gift of God.</hi> The Lord saith here <hi>I will Restore thy Judges and thy Counsellours.</hi> It is not in the Power of all the men in the World to make a good Counsellour, except God first make him to be such an one. There are but few men in the World compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively who are fit to give Counsel, especially in the difficult affairs of State. And they that are, it is God that has furnished them with gifts and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications for such a station. <hi>Who maketh thee to differ</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>and what hast thou that thou didst not Receive.</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 7. Who is it that makes one man to be greater or better then another? To be Richer or Wiser then another. It is the Lord that makes it to be so. When <hi>John Baptists</hi> Disciples were troubled that another, (tho' infinitely his Superiour) was preferred before him, He said to them <hi>A man can Receive nothing except it be given him from Heaven.</hi> Joh. 3. 27. If a man has Reputation above another, he has Received it from Heaven, and if he has great accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in more respect then one, he is beholden to Heaven for them all. It is said of Solomon, <hi>That God gave him Wisdome and Understanding exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Much, and Largeness of Heart even as the Sand that is on the Sea shore,</hi> because of the infinite number of Wise Conceptions that his Large soul was able to Comprehend. 1 King 4. 29. Royal Endowments were confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on him, and it was God that did make him sit to be a King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so if any man has the undeerstanding which is requisite in a Counsellour, it is God that
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:000659_0009_0FA9A094346F7640"/>
has given him that Understanding. And it is His Proivdence that does order who shall be such. There are some in the World who are well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished to be in such a Capacity that are not made use of. There are that have this Preeminence belonging to them as their Birth-Right. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Men are <hi>Consiliarij Nati.</hi> Others are Chosen and Constituted by the Supream Power. In some Places the People have a Concurrence in the <hi>Election of</hi> Counsellours. This notwithstanding, the God of Heaven de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines and over-rules all. Whoever may have an hand in the Choice, their Spirits and all their Actions are disposed of by an Invisible Power. <hi>The Lot is cast into the Lap, but the whole disposing thereof is of the Lord.</hi> Pro. 16. 33.</p>
            <p>Moreover when any persons are qualified for, and chosen unto a Service of this Nature, it is God that does incline their hearts, to accept of that Trouble. Indeed the Generality of men (and especially such as are unfit) need no great perswasion to comply with such Offers. But there are some who are as averse to Publick Employments as was <hi>Moses;</hi> when he said S<hi>end I pray thee by the Hand of whom thou wilt send,</hi> only let me be excused. I have had the happiness to be acquainted with a Great and Noble Personage, who was desired by Two Kings Successively to be of Their Council, but declined it. The affairs of a People may be so Perplexed, as that a wise Man may be afraid to meddle, or to be any way interested in their Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick concerns. This we see in what the Prophet Speaks, <hi>Isai.</hi> 3. 6, 7. <hi>Be thou our Ruler, and Let this Ruine be under thy Hand,—I will not be an Healer, Make me not a Ruler of the People.</hi> I see (saith He) you are a Ruined People, and I have no mind that your Ruin should be under my Hand, therefore I will not accept of your offer. <hi>Counsellours</hi> (such as are so by their place and office) do <hi>Assist in Government.</hi> Now the Work of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is no easy Labour. That Celebrated saying of <hi>Melancthons</hi> has a great deal of Truth in it, that there are there hard Labours <hi>Parturientis</hi> the Labour of Child birth, <hi>Docentis,</hi> the Labour of one that is a Teacher, <hi>Regentis,</hi> the Labour of one that is a Ruler. They that never did, &amp; were never fit to make trial of it, may think it easy, but others do not find it so. One of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> had in all the Windows of his House a Crown in a Bush of Thorns, to signify what Cares do attend Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If then Wise men shall be willing to deny themselves as to their own repose, and to encounter with many difficulties in serving the Publick Interest, it is God that has made them so.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Proposition II. Primitive Counsellors are men of singular Qualifications.</hi> The Scripture mentions especially four Graces which Rulers and Counsellours should be adorned with: And they which have them being quailified ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000659_0010_0FA9A094F5232A28"/>
to that <hi>Rule which is from the Beginning,</hi> are Primitive Counsellers.</p>
            <p>The first is <hi>Piety towards God.</hi> Counsellers ought to be, and Counsellers at the Beginning were Godly men. So it was when the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> first <hi>began</hi> to be a Common-wealth under <hi>Moses;</hi> and at their <hi>Beginning</hi> to be a Settled Kingdom under <hi>David.</hi> The Judges who were Governours, were Godly, and some of the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> were Holy men, and then we may be sure their Counsellers were so too. Psal. 4.3. <hi>The Lord hath set apart him that is Godly for Himself.</hi> This was spoken concerning <hi>David'</hi>s being <hi>set apart</hi> to be the chief Ruler over the People of God; so they that are <hi>set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part</hi> to assist him whom God has made Ruler and Governour in Chief ought to be Godly. The first Counseller of State that we read of in the Scripture was <hi>Jethro,</hi> a very pious person. He advised <hi>Moses</hi> to chuse some to assist him in Government, and sheweth how they should be qualified. <hi>Provide</hi> (saith he) <hi>Such as Fear God.</hi> Exod. 18. 31. such as will by their Authority and Example Encourage others to Fear and Serve Him. That will make the Advancement of Gods Interest their chief Design. That will so act &amp; so speak as men that really believe they must give an Account to the Great and Eternal God. That will often think with themselves, is this Counsil according to the approving Will of God, and that will not for the World advise to any thing which they believe is contrary thereunto.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Fidelity towards men</hi> is another requisite in a Counseller. A Primitive Counseller is qualified with Righteousness as well as Piety. Choose <hi>men of Truth</hi> said <hi>Jethro. Counsellers</hi> are <hi>Rulers.</hi> Now he that Ruleth over men must be <hi>Just, Ruling in the Fear of God,</hi> 2 Sam. 23. 3. They ought to be men, that will give to God the <hi>things that are Gods, and to</hi> Caesar, <hi>the things that are</hi> Caesars; yea, that will give to all men their due. <hi>Counsellers</hi> ought to be, and Counsellers at the Beginning were, <hi>Faithful</hi> to him that is the Chief Ruler, in advising him for the best: Such an one was <hi>Hushai</hi> the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ebite</hi> unto <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 17. 15. <hi>Thus and thus did Ahitophel Counsel, and thus and thus have I Counselled.</hi> He Saved the Life of his Prince by giving that Counsel. Men in such a Station should moreover approve themselves <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> to the Interest of the People, whose Welfare as Counsellers they are bound to endeavour. The Prince and the People have not opposite Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests, He that promoves the true Interest of the one, does so of the other also. A great Emperour was wont to say, <hi>Non mibi sed populo;</hi> I am Set in this High Station, not for my self, but for the Nations sake. So are Counsellers to advise unto such things as the People, the Country who are Concerned in them, may have cause to Bless God for them. Such a Counseller was <hi>Mordecai</hi> in the Court of P<hi>ersia.</hi> Esth. 10. 3. <hi>Mordecai the Jew was next unto King Ahasuerus;</hi> He ws Advanced to be a Right Honourable Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seller,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000659_0011_0FA9A095FB895D10"/>
S<hi>eeking the</hi> W<hi>ealth of his</hi> P<hi>eople.</hi> It was said of one of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> that He was, <hi>Titularis non tutelaris Rex, defuit non praefuit Reipublicae</hi> So may it be said of such Counsellers, as do not intend and faithfully design the Good of that people, over whom the Providence of God has placed them, they have only the Name, but not the nature of C<hi>ounsellers</hi> in them. True Primitive Counsellers they are not.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is necessary that <hi>Counsellers should be Endued with the Grace of</hi> C<hi>ourage.</hi> The Spirit of Counsel and of <hi>Might,</hi> that is to say of <hi>Courage,</hi> are conjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, because Counsellers should be men of Courage, <hi>Isa</hi> 11. 2. And this is implied in that of their <hi>Fearing God, h. e.</hi> they must Fear God and not men. <hi>Moses</hi> gave it in Charge unto those whom he did Commission to be Judges, Deut. 1. 17. <hi>You shall not be afraid of the Face of man.</hi> The like is to be said unto Counsellers. S<hi>olomons</hi> Throne was supported by Lions, 2 King. 10. 20. Thus Counsellers who are the Supporters of the Government should be of Magnanimous and Undaunted Spirits. The Pillars of a Land must not Warp either for fear or favour. They may not Fear the Frowns of them that are above them, so as to neglect their Duty. If they should see the Chief Ruler in danger of falling into any Error, which would be inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to Himself or to his People; they ought freely tho' humbly to advise Him to desist. It is reported concerning the <hi>Chines,</hi> that the Counsellers of their Prince do with great Freedom admonish him of dangerous Errors, and that if they do it not, they are not accounted worthy of the Name of Counsellers, or men of Honour. <hi>Joab</hi> did the part of a Faithful Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler unto <hi>David,</hi> in disswading from his ambitious Design of Numbring the People: W<hi>hy</hi> (said he) <hi>does my Lord the King require this? Why will he be a cause of Trespass unto Israel.</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 4. 3. And at another time, when <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was too much Transported with passion at the Death of his Son <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom, Joab</hi> advised him to refrain himself, and to speak kindly to the men that had Hazzarded their Lives to Save his; and <hi>David</hi> had the Wisdom to Hearken to that good Advice. Nor should Counsellers in the Discharge of their Duty, be afraid of the Multitude. <hi>Job</hi> saith, <hi>Did I fear a great Multitude? or did the Contempt of Families terrify me. Job</hi> 31. 34. He knew that if he did punish Vice, the Families and Relations of such as had suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the Law, would reproach him and a multitude would clamour against him, but that would not deter him from a Faithful Discharge of the Duty of his Place; such Courage becomes a Counseller. Let a man give the best Counsel in the World, he shall never please every body: There is such variety and Contrariety in the Opinions of men, that all cannot be pleased; sometimes not a few only, but the major part, take in with the wrong side, and have their unreasonable Dissatisfactions; now Counsellers
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:000659_0012_0FA9A097DA9DB880"/>
must do their Duty, let the World be pleased or displeased. They may not at any time be afraid to own Christ and his Cause, but if they see Designs on foot against the best Interest, they ought boldly to interpose, and to oppose themselves. It is said of <hi>Joseph of Arimathea,</hi> that he was an <hi>Honourable Counseller,</hi> Mark 15. 43 some think that he was one of the <hi>Sane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim,</hi> the great Council of the Nation. Others suppose him to be one of the Governours Council. Now when there was a <hi>Consult</hi> about putting Christ to Death, this <hi>Joseph</hi> Entred his Dissent, and after the Lord was by Forms of Law, and false Witnesses, and an Accusation of pretended Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, Condemned and Murdered, this H<hi>onourable Counseller,</hi> went <hi>boldly</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Pilate</hi> who had received a Commission to be Governour over the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Judea,</hi> and <hi>Craved the Body of Jesus.</hi> Thus did He with Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary Courage own Christ and his Cause.</p>
            <p>And yet more than all this is required in a Counseller. A man may be a Pious, a Faithful, a Couragious man, and for all that not fit to be a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seller. Therefore 4. <hi>It is necessary that a Counseller be qualified with the Grace of Wisdom.</hi> The Divine Wisdom is expressed by that of being <hi>Great in Counsel.</hi> Jer. 32. 19. Only God, Angels, and men are Causes by Counsel. The more Wisdom there is in any man, the more able he is to give Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel: It is noted concerning that Faithful Minister of God, Z<hi>achariah,</hi> who was (as Interpreters have noted) an <hi>Ecclesiastical Counseller,</hi> one with whom the King was wont to advise in matters of Religion, that He was a <hi>wise Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seller,</hi> 1 Chron. 26. 14. So should all Counsellers be men of Wisdom. Hence 'tis said by the Prophet, Jer. 49. 7. <hi>Is Wisdom no more in Teman? Is Counsel perished from the Prudent? is their Wisdom vanished.</hi> Imprudent men are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to be made Counsell<gap reason="illegible: torn page" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> P<hi>haraohs</hi> Counsellers of Old were wise men, but his Chief Counseller <hi>Joseph</hi> (tho' a young man did Excel them all in Wisdom. P<hi>haraoh</hi> said to him, <hi>There is none so discreet and wise as thou art. Gen.</hi> 41. 37. And the Psalmist saith of him, that He <hi>Taught</hi> Pharaohs S<hi>ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> (his Counsellers) <hi>Wisdom.</hi> Psal. 105. 22. Courage without Wisdom, in one that undertakes to be a Counseller, will do more hurt than good. An Horse that is full of Metal, if he has no Eyes to see his way before him, is a dangerous Creature to make use of. If rash, heady, unthinking men are made use of for Counsellers, the Publick Weal of such a People is in danger. The carnal Jews indeed depended too much on this that they had Wise men at Helm to be their Counsellers of State Jer. 18. 18. <hi>The Law shall not perish from the Priests, nor</hi> C<hi>ounsel from the Wise.</hi> We have wiser men than <hi>Jeremy</hi> (say they) to Sit in Council, and therefore what He adviseth unto is not to be regarded; but tho' a Nation whose Counsellers are great Politicians may possibly be ruined (as the Jewish
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000659_0013_0FA9A097F6AADF80"/>
Nation was) if they have not such Counsellers, they are in an ill case, as we shall have occasion anon further to declare.</p>
            <p>Proposition III. <hi>Such Counsellers as these described are a singular mercy and Blessing of God to a</hi> P<hi>eople.</hi> I shall only mention two things that Evince the Truth of this Proposition.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Civil Government is a great and necessary Blessing.</hi> Without it the World would soon be Dissolved, and run into Confusion. As one speak<gap reason="illegible: torn page" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the World would not then be a KOSMOS, a Beautiful Structure, but a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, an horrid Heap of Disorder. What would Kingdoms be were it not for Government? but (as <hi>Austin</hi> expresses it) <hi>Magna Latrocinia,</hi> great Dens of Thieves. Let a people that have found the benefit of Government be without it for a while, and they will quickly be made sensible that 'tis a great and a necessary Blessing. I have read that it was once a Law amongst the P<hi>ersians,</hi> that after the Death of their King, every man should have Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to do what he pleased for five days; and in these five days time there was such horrid doings, that all the people prized Government the better all their days after. Now Government cannot well be managed by one alone without the Assistance of Counsellers. Many Eyes see more than one. 'Tis possible that one man may discern that which another does not see. Besides, the Burden will be too heavy for one alone. Hence <hi>Moses</hi> said to the Children of <hi>Israel, I am not able to bear you my self alone. Deu<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 9. and again verse 12. <hi>How can I my self alone bear your Cumbrances, and your Burdens, and your Strife?</hi> Where there is a great people, the Burden is too heavy for a mortal man, tho' never so wise and able. <hi>Moses</hi> was a wise States-man, nevertheless <hi>Jethro</hi> advised him to take some to assist him, in Ruling that numerous people, because else the Burden would be so heavy upon him, as that he must needs sink and break under the weight of it. Exod. 18. 18. The wisest Ruler in the World needs the assistance of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellers. <hi>Solomon</hi> (the wisest of men) had his Counsellers about him. The truth is, the Light of Nature has taught men not only to Erect Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but that there should be Counsellers to assist the Chief Ruler. The Scripture informs us that not only the Kings of <hi>Israel,</hi> but the Kings of the Gentiles had their Counsellers, with whom they were wont to take Advice in all arduous Affairs. <hi>Ezra</hi> Blesseth God, who had extended Mercy to him before <hi>Artaxarxes</hi> the King of P<hi>ersia,</hi> and <hi>his Counsellers.</hi> Ezra 7. 28. And in the 14 verse <hi>He was sent of the King, and his seven</hi> C<hi>ounsellers</hi> Perhaps there might be Superstition in their fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Number seven, if they did it (as some Learned Men sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) because they would have their Government to Resemble the Heavens, wherein there are seven Planets: But as to the thing, that there
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000659_0014_0FA9A098AFC216E8"/>
should be C<hi>ounsellers,</hi> the Light of Nature instructed them; and therefore it is so in all Nations and Governments.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The</hi> I<hi>nttrest and Influence of good Counsellers is great.</hi> They have a great Interest in the Chief Ruler. In Governments, which are more absolute, and much more in those that are more Limited it is so, especially where the principal Ruler cannot Act without their Consent. It cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed of how great Concernment it is for such a People to be Blessed with Counsellers <hi>as at the Beginning.</hi> Not only whole <hi>Provinces</hi> but whole <hi>Kingdoms</hi> have Fared the better for the Wise Counsils of one Good man. So did <hi>Egypt,</hi> because there was such a wise Counseller as <hi>Joseph</hi> found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them. And the whole Kingdom of <hi>Israel</hi> found the benefit of it, when <hi>David</hi> made the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> to be of his Cabinet Council. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> Owed his Crown, and the People much of their Happiness to the seasonable <hi>Advice</hi> of <hi>Nathan,</hi> which had a great influence on the Royal Heart of King <hi>David,</hi> in causing him to Nominate <hi>Solomon</hi> to Succeed in Government, whereby great Confusions that otherwise would have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, were prevented. <hi>Rehoboam</hi> had not lost ten parts in twelve of his Kingdom, if he had followed the wise Advice of his Fathers Counsellers Nor had Z<hi>edekiah</hi> Lost his Kingdom, nor had the City and Temple been Burnt, and the whole Land made Desolate, if the good Counsel of the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> had been hearkened unto, whom God sent to be a Counseller to them. <hi>If I give thee Counsel</hi> (said the Prophet to the King) <hi>wilt thou not hearken unto me. Jer.</hi> 38. 15. It had been well if he had.</p>
            <p>When there are <hi>Counsellers as at the Beginning,</hi> two things usually fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, which make a people happy.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>There will be good Judges.</hi> Much of the Welfare of a People does consist in their having Able and Upright Judges, that will endeavour to approve themselves in all things like unto God, the Judge of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, with whom there is no Iniquity, nor Respect of persons. Hence <hi>Moses</hi> who Loved the Lords <hi>P</hi>eople in the Wilderness more than He Loved his own Life, out of Respect to their Welfare took of the Chief of the Tribes, Wise Men, and Known, and gave them a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission and Instruction,</hi> to Act as Judges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> solemnly charging them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit themselves as became men in their places Deut. 1. 15, 16, 16. Now if there be Counsellers as at the Beginning, there will be Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es as at the First. It cannot but be so in a Government, where no Judges are appointed but with the consent of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. Good Counsellers will Advise to good Judges, and good Judges will make the Land happy.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:000659_0015_0FA9A0997AB75F40"/>
2. <hi>Where there are good Counsellours, Religion and Reformation will be Encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</hi> Primitive Counsellers will concern themselves to uphold Religion in the Truth, Purity and Power of it. In King <hi>Joash</hi> his Time, as long as <hi>Jebojadah</hi> was his Chief Counseller, <hi>The Service of the House of the Lord</hi> was duly attended, but when ill Counsellers succeeded and were hearkened unto, <hi>they Left the House of the Lord God of their Fathers, and</hi> S<hi>erved Groves and Idols.</hi> There is no great fear or danger of Apostasy in Matters of Religion, as long as there are <hi>Counsellers as at the Beginning.</hi> It is in their Power to prevent it, and they will prevent it. For a people to Enjoy the only true Religion; to have not only Liberty, but Encouragement to Serve God in the way and after the manner which Himself in His Holy Word has Appointed, is a mercy beyond Expression great. And thus it will be as long as there are such Counsellers as I am speaking of. <hi>Reformers</hi> are great Blessings to the places where they Live: <hi>Primitive Counsellers</hi> are of a Reforming Spirit. The Work of Reformation useth to go forward, when such are in Place. Besides Scripture Examples, we have seen it in our own Nation. In the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> 8. When he had such Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellers as <hi>Cromwel</hi> and <hi>Cramner,</hi> there was in some things a great Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And in several Reigns since that: Wise Counsellers have made our Nation happy, and as to many particulars more Reformed than once it was. There is a Glorious Day a coming, (and I trust in Christ that it is not far off) when the Church of God throughout the whole World, will be in a more Reformed State than ever yet was known since the World began, <hi>When Judges as at the First, and Counsellers as at the Beginning,</hi> will be the Instruments in the Hands of Christ, by whom it shall be effected. Wherefore in the next words to my Text, it is said, <hi>afterwards thou shalt be called the City of Righteousness, the Faithful City.</hi> Jerusalem the Church of God all the World over shall become a City of Righteousness, but first, and that it may be so, Primitive Counsellers shall be Restored.</p>
            <p>We come now to make some Application of the Doctrine thus far In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted on.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Hence the contrary unto this of a Peoples being Blessed with Primitive Counsellors is a sore Judgment.</hi> It is said that <hi>where no Counsel is, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple fall, but in the multitude of Counsellers there is safety.</hi> Prov. 11. 14. Where there are good Counsellers, and a multitude of them, we may expect good, and much good, a multitude of Blessings will be on such a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but where there are none such, nothing but ruine can be hoped
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:000659_0016_0FA9A09A2C0CCF48"/>
for. The Removal of wise Counsellers is threatned as a sore Judgment. Isai. 3. 3. When a People is reduced unto that condition, that there are none fit for Counsellors to be found amongst them, their State is deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, they are either perfectly undone, or the next door to ruin. Mic. 4 9. <hi>Why dost thou cry aloud, is the Counseller perished?</hi> There is cause enough to cry aloud if it be so. They may well make Loud Outcries of their being an undone people amongst whom the <hi>Counseller is perished.</hi> And thus it is where there are Counsellors of pernicious principles and inclinations: Such an one there was in <hi>Nineveh,</hi> where the King of <hi>Assyria</hi> kept his Court. Neh. 1. 11. <hi>There is one come out of thee that imagineth Evil against the Lord, a wicked</hi> C<hi>ounsellor.</hi> Perhaps <hi>Rabshekeh</hi> might be the Counsellor whom the Prophet there reflects upon. However, one he was that advised the King to Persecute the People of <hi>G</hi>od, and to Act Arbitrarily, without any respect to right or wrong. Such Counsellors there were in <hi>Persia,</hi> who perswaded the Emperour to Establish Iniquity by a Law, and then to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute and Murder all such as could not with a good Conscience Conform to that Law, Dan. 6. 7.</p>
               <p>Politicians have laid it down for a Maxim, and there is a Truth in it. <hi>That a People had better have a bad</hi> P<hi>rince with a good Council, than a good Prince with a bad Council.</hi> For Evil Counsellors will (as one expresseth it) <hi>by their poysonous Whispers and Instillations at the Ear, Corrupt the Heart, &amp; Taint the Spirits of the best Princes.</hi> Kings and Kingdoms have often been Ruined by Evil Counsils. So was King <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> who would needs take some of the House of <hi>Ahab</hi> to be of his Council, and it is noted, that <hi>they were his Counsellors to his Destruction.</hi> 2 Chron. 22. 4. The Kingdom of <hi>Israel</hi> was divided and so weakned after the Death of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and unhappy Counsellors were the cause of it. And thus it has been in our Nation. Not only in former Times, but in our Days. How came the late Abdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated King to be Deposed from his Kingly Throne, and his Glory to be taken from him; but because instead of hearkening to Counsellers as at the Beginning, he would be Governed by Popish Counsils.</p>

And let me fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther add here, that it is very meet that persons Nominated for Counsellers should be men of Estate, and of some <hi>P</hi>ort in the World. Isa. 3. 7. <hi>Thou hast</hi> C<hi>loathing be thou our Ruler.</hi> Thou hast an Estate to Support the place and Dignity of a Ruler, and therefore we Choose thee. If this be not considered, Government will be rendred contemptible, and that cannot be without Sin. Let me also say to you who are the Representatives of his People, that it will not be prudence in you (at this time especially) to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose such Assistants to the<hi>G</hi>overnour as you cannot but know, thatHe cannot Accept of, and so to necessitate him to make use of his Negative Voice, when He has no desire to do it.And you cannot but know that whoever is <hi>G</hi>overnour, He will judge it necessary that many of his C<hi>ouncil</hi> should have their Habitations near to his, that so if any sudden Emergency or Danger to the <hi>P</hi>ublick should happen, his Council may be at Hand to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise with. And you cannot but know that no <hi>G</hi>overnour will take those into his Council, who are <hi>Malecontents,</hi> and do what in them is to make others to be Disaffected to the Government. No Governour can take such men into his Bosome.</p>
               <p>And as for your self Excellent Sir, whom God has made the Captain over his <hi>P</hi>eople in this Wilderness, It is a very great <hi>P</hi>ower which the Divine Providence has put into your Hands, that you should have a <hi>Negative</hi> on the <hi>Elections</hi> of this Day.

It was Certainly a True Confession which the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> made on a Publick Fast Day. Neh. 9. 37. <hi>The Kings whom thou hast set over us because of our Sins, have dominion over our Bodys, and over our Cattel, at their pleasure.</hi> They once had Merciful Rulers, and those too from amongst themselves, but they sinned them away, and were for a time in the hands of Strangers who did exercise an Arbitrary Power over them, so that they could not say that their Cattle, or their Lands, or any thing was their own: all was at the Will and Pleasure of Strangers. <hi>New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ngland</hi> has had some experience of this. <hi>Your Land Strangers did devour it</hi> in <hi>your presence.</hi> You must give what they pleased to demand that so you might have a pretended Confirmation of your Estates and Properties.

The Counsellours which then carried all were not Counsellours as at the beginning. God has Mercifully delivered you from them. But if the sins which brought that Judgment on the Land are still amongst us unrefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and unrepented of; what can be expected, but that after a clear Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine for a while the Clouds will return again with greater Darkness than ever? What those sins were I need not say, so much having been spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken concerning that, many Years ago. To be sure the great sin of this Generation is their forgetting the Errand on which their Fathers came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Wilderness which was not to seek great things for themselves, but to seek the Kingdom of God and His Righteousness. Let this people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their Primitive Holiness, and they need not doubt but God will Bless them with Primitive Counsellours; and that they shall see that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise made to <hi>Jacob</hi> fulfilled, Jer. 30. 8. S<hi>trangers shall no more serve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Let us be very thankful for what we enjoy.</hi> To be thankful for Mercys, is the way to have them continued. What would not <hi>New-England</hi> have given no longer since then Five Years ago, to have been sure of what they now enjoy? And what, tho' you have not some Great Priviledges which once you had, and which should have been Restored to you, if He that speaketh to you this Day, could have obtained them for you, tho' it be with the Expence of his own Life, and of all that is Dear to him in this World will you be thankful for nothing: because you have not every thing just as you would have? Do any of you say, <hi>all that you have is nothing?</hi> I hear there are some (tho' not many) that say so. Let me Reason with you before the Lord this Day? You have by the Royal Charter granted to you, Property confirmed, so that every Man may sit under his <hi>own Vine,</hi> and his <hi>own Figtree.</hi> And is this nothing. I am sure you would have thought it something, and a great thing too, but a Few years since. You have all English Liberties Restored to you, so that a Governour with a <hi>Juncto</hi> of his Council cannot (as of late they did) make Laws, and impose Taxes on you, without your own consent, by your Representative, And is this nothing? No Governour can now cause you, or your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren or Servants (as not long since they might) to be sent out of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. Your Present Charter Secures you against all such Invasions. And do you now account it nothing? You have Peculiar Charter Priviledges granted to you, which no other English Plantation in the World has. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness your being here this Day. No other Plantation has that Priviledge of Nominating to the Governour, his Council: nor have the Kings Subjects in <hi>England</hi> it self that Priviledge; and is this nothing? Your Religion is secured to you. Now you need not fear being sent to Prison (as some
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:000659_0020_0FA9A09DED2724A0"/>
of you were under a late Government) because you scruple Swearing by a Book. You may Worship God in the greatest Purity, and no one may Disturb you. If you set apart Daies for Solemn Praier or Praises, as the Divine Providence may call thereunto, you need not fear being interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or Obstructed therein as it was here six year ago. You may by Laws not only Protect, but encourage that Religion which is the General Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the Country. And is all this nothing? You have at present a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, and a Lievtenant Governour, (and all the Council likewise) from amongst yourselves, who do unteignedly seek your welfare. And is this nothing? Some of you say it will not be long thus. In which you speak more then you know. But Suppose so. <hi>Ezra</hi> and the Lords Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le with him, thought they had great cause to be thankful to God in that <hi>He had given them a Little reviving in their Bondage,</hi> and extended mercy to them in the sight of the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> who had by a Charter granted them Liberty to set up the House of God, and to repair the Desolations thereof, as we may do this Day. But if a Change come, and the <hi>L</hi>ord be <hi>P</hi>rovoked again to set Rulers over you that will obstruct what is Good and desireable, you that are the <hi>Murmurers</hi> will be found the Guilty cause of it before the <hi>L</hi>ord, in the Name of the <hi>L</hi>ord be it spoken to you.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Prayer unto God may be a means to obtain the Continuance of this so great a mercy.</hi> Be Earnest with God that you may still have Counsellours as at the Beginning. And you are on this (as well as on many other) accounts Concerned to pray for the King and Queen; For as long as Their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Majesties shall hold the <hi>English</hi> Scepter in their Hands, we in <hi>New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> may hope to see Good days. God has Blessed Our Nation with a King in the <hi>P</hi>reservation of whom the Fate of <hi>Europe</hi> and of the Church of God is more concerned then it has been in the life of any one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for these Thousand Years. A King that Fights the Battels of the Lord. A King that when a Crown was offered to him, declared, that nothing should Oblige him to be a Persecuter. Who that has a Spark of Grace in his Heart, will not pray for such a King? A King that has more then once or twice in My hearing and to me expressed a singular respect to His Good Subjects in these Colonies.</p>
               <p>And Pray for the Queen.</p>
               <p>For God has blessed the Nation with a Queen (as well as with a King) the like unto whom (without Reflection on any Predecessors) never sat on the <hi>English</hi> Throne. A Queen that loveth all people that are good, whatever their perswasions in matters relating to Conscience may be. A Queen that is a pattern of Vertue to the Nation. A Queen that has
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:000659_0021_0FA9A09EAF8E1280"/>
(to my certain knowledge) interceded with the King, that He would be kind to <hi>New-England.</hi> Pray then for the Life and Prosperity of such a King and such a Queen. And I do the rather urge this upon you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I have sometimes been favoured with the Liberty humbly to assure Their Majesties, that there are none in the World that Pray for them with more fervency and frequency then do Their Subjects in <hi>New-England.</hi> I beseech you make it appear that I was not mistaken in what I have affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed concerning you.</p>
               <p>And pray for them that shall be Established as C<hi>ounsellers</hi> and Rulers over you this Day: That the Lord Jesus whose Name is C<hi>ounseller,</hi> will be with them: That the Lord Jesus who saith, <hi>Counsel is mine and sound.</hi> W<hi>isdom,</hi> will please to give them of his Spirit,which is the Spirit of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Understanding, <hi>the Spirit of</hi> C<hi>ounsil and Might, the Spirit of Knowledge and of the Fear of the Lord.</hi>
