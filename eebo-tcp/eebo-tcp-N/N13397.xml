            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is impoſſible to ſit down and think ſeriouſly on the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of America, but the original principles on which ſhe reſiſted, and the glow and ardor they inſpired, will occur like the undefaced remembrance of a lovely ſcene.

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>. In this indulgence of generous recollection we <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

               </gap> by what we ſeem to give, and the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

               </gap> we become,</p>
            <p>So extenſively right was <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> which America pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, that it not only took in every <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> intereſt of every claſs and order of men to defend the country. The war, on the part of Britain, was originally a war of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs. The ſordid and not the ſplendid paſſions gave it being. The fertile fields and proſperous infancy of America appeared to her as mines for tributary wealth. She viewed the hive, and diſregarding the induſtry that had enriched it, thirſted for the honey. But in the preſent ſtage of her affairs, the violence of temper is added to the rage of avarice; and therefore, that which, at our firſt ſetting out, proceeded from purity of principle and public intereſt, is now heightened by all the obligations of neceſſity; for it requires but little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of human nature to diſcern what would be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, were America again reduced to the ſubjection of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Uncontrouled power, in the hands of an incenſed, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious and apacious conqueror, is an engine of dreadful exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and woe be to that country over which it can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed. The names of Whig and Tory would them be ſunk in the general term of Rebel, and the oppreſſion, whatever it might be, would, with very few inſtances of exception, light equally on all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:016919_0002_0F9EC8B8CC41C1A0"/>Britain did not go to war with America for the ſake of domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, becauſe ſhe was then in poſſeſſion; neither was it for the extenſion of trade and commerce, becauſe ſhe had monopolized the whole and the country had yielded to it; neither was it to extinguiſh what <hi>ſhe</hi> might call rebellion, becauſe before ſhe began no reſiſtence exiſted. It could then be from no other motive than avarice, or a deſign of eſtabliſhing, in the firſt inſtance, the ſame taxes in America as are paid in England (which, as I ſhall preſently ſhow, are above eleven times heavier than the taxes we now pay for the preſent year 1780) or, in the ſecond inſtance, to confiſcate the whole property of America, in caſe of reſiſtance and conqueſt, of the latter of which ſhe had then no doubt.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now proceed to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>

to pay the intereſt of the national debt contracted by former wars, and the remaining ſum of ſix millions ſix hundred and forty two thouſand ſix hundred pounds was applied to defray the yearly expence of government, the peace eſtabliſhment of the army and navy, placemen penſioners, &amp;c. conſequently the whole of her enormous taxes being thus appropriated, ſhe had nothing to ſpare out of them towards defraying the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of the preſent war or any other. Yet had ſhe not been in debt at the beginning of the war at we were not, and like us had only a land and not a naval war to carry on, her then revenue of eleven millions and a half pounds ſterling would defray all her annual expences of war and government within each year.</p>
            <p>But this not being the caſe with her, ſhe is obliged to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row about ten million pounds ſterling yearly, to proſecute the war ſhe is now engaged in (this year ſhe borrowed twelve) and lay on new taxes to diſcharge the intereſt; and allowing that the preſent war has coſt her only fifty millions ſterling, the intereſt thereon at five per cent. will be two millions and an half, therefore the amount of her taxes now muſt be fourteen millions, which on an average is no leſs than forty ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings ſterling per head, men, women and children through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

the nation. Now as this expence of fifty millions was borrowed on the hopes of conquering America, and as it was avarice which firſt induced her to commence the war, how truly wretched and deplorable would the condition of this country be, were ſhe, by own remiſſneſs, to ſuffer an enemy of ſuch a diſpoſition, and ſo circumſtanced, to reduce her to ſubjection.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to the revenues of America.</p>
            <p>I have already ſtated the number of ſouls in America to be three millions, and by a calculation I have made, which I have every reaſon to believe is ſufficiently right, the whole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the war, and the ſupport of the ſeveral governments, may be defrayed for two million pounds ſterling, annually; which, on an average, is thirteen ſhillings and four pence per head, men, women and children, and the peace eſtabliſhment at the end of the war will be but three quarters of a million, or five ſhillings ſterling per head. Now throwing out of the queſtion every thing of honor, principle, happineſs, freedom, and reputation in the world, and taking it up on the ſimple ground of intereſt, I put the following caſe.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe Britain was to conquer America, and as conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors was to lay her under no other conditions than to pay the ſame proportions toward her annual revenue which the people of England pay; our ſhare, in that caſe, would be ſix mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion pounds ſterling yearly; can it then be a queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is beſt to raiſe two millions to defend the country, and govern it ourſelves, and only three quarters of a million af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, or pay ſix millions to have it conquered, and let the enemy govern it.</p>
            <p>Can it be ſuppoſed that conquerors would chuſe to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a worſe condition than what they granted to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered. In England, the tax on rum is five ſhillings and one penny ſterling per gallon, which is one ſilver dollar and four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen coppers. Now would it not be laughable to imagine, that after the expence they have been at, they would let either Whig or Tory in America drink it cheaper than themſelves. Coffee which is ſo conſiderable an article of conſumption and ſupport here is there loaded with a duty, which makes the price between five and ſix ſhillings ſterling a pound, and a penalty of fifty pounds ſterling on any perſon detected in roaſting it in his own houſe. There is ſcarce an article of life you can eat, drink, wear, or enjoy that is not there loaded with a tax; even the light from heaven is only permitted to ſhine into their dwellings by paying eighteen pence ſterling per window annually; and the humbleſt drink of life, ſmall beer, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not there be purchaſed without a tax of nearly two coppers
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:016919_0005_0F9EC8BC510AD6B8"/>
a gallon, beſides a heavy tax upon the malt, and another on the hops before it is brewed, excluſive of a land tax on the earth which produces them. In ſhort, the condition of that country in point of taxation is ſo oppreſſive, the number of her poor ſo great, and the extravagance and rapaciouſneſs of the court ſo enormous, that were they to effect a conqueſt of America, it is then only that the diſtreſſes of America would begin. Neither would it ſignify any thing to a man whether he be what we call a Whig or a Tory. The people of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and the miniſtry of that country know us by no ſuch diſtinctions. What they want is clear ſolid revenue, and the modes they would take to procure it, would operate alike on all. Their manner of reaſoning would be ſhort, becauſe they would naturally infer that if we were able to carry on a war of five or ſix years againſt them, we are able to pay the ſame taxes which they do.</p>
            <p>I have already ſtated that the expence of conducting the preſent war, and the government of the ſeveral ſtates, may be done for two millions ſterling, and the eſtabliſhment in time of peace, for three quarters of a million <note n="‡" place="bottom">I have made the calculations in ſterling, becauſe it is a rate generally known in all the ſtates, and becauſe likewiſe it admits of an eaſy compariſon between our expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to ſupport the war and thoſe of the enemy. Four ſilver dollars and an half is one pound ſterling and threepence over.</note>.</p>
            <p>As to navy matters, they flouriſh ſo well, and are ſo well attended to, in the hands of individuals, that I think it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent on every principle of real uſe and oeconomy, to turn the navy into hard money (keeping only three or four pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) and apply it to promote the ſervice of the army. We ſhall not have a ſhip the leſs; the uſe of them, and the benefit from them, will be greatly increaſed, and their expences ſaved. We are now allied with a formidable naval power, from whom we derive the aſſiſtance of a navy. And the line in which we can proſecute the war, ſo as to reduce the common enemy and benefit the alliance moſt effectually, will be by attending cloſely to the land ſervice.</p>
            <p>I eſtimate the charge of keeping up and maintaining an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, officering them, and all expences included, ſufficient for the defence of the country, to be equal to the expence of forty thouſand men at thirty pounds ſterling per head, which is one million two hundred thouſand pounds.</p>

            <p>I take the proportion of this ſtate, Pennſylvania, to be an eighth part of the Thirteen United States, the quota then for us to raiſe will be two hundred and fifty thouſand pounds ſterling; two hundred thouſand of which will be our ſhare for the ſupport and pay of the army and Continental expences at home and abroad, and fifty thouſand pounds for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of ſtate government.</p>
            <p>In order to gain an idea of the proportion in which the raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a ſum will fall, I make the following calculation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Pennſylvania contains three hundred and ſeventy five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand inhabitants, men, women and children, which is likewiſe an eighth part of the whole inhabitants of the United States: therefore two hundred and fifty thouſand pounds ſterling to be raiſed among three hundred and ſeventy five thouſand perſons, is, on an average, thirteen ſhillings and fourpence ſterling per head per annum, or ſomething more than one ſhilling ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling per month. And our proportion of three quarters of a million for the government of the country, in time of peace, will be ninety three thouſand ſeven hundred and fifty pounds ſterling, fifty thouſand of which will be for the government expences of the ſtate, and forty three thouſand ſeven hundred and fifty pounds for Continental expences at home and abroad.</p>
            <p>The peace eſtabliſhment then will, on an average, be five ſhillings ſterling per head. Whereas was England now to ſtop, and the war ceaſe, her peace eſtabliſhment would continue the ſame as it is now, viz. forty ſhillings per head; therefore was our taxes neceſſary for carrying on the war as much per head as hers now is, and the difference to be only whether we ſhould, at the end of the war, pay at the rate of five ſhillings per head, or forty ſhillings per head, the caſe needs no think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of. But as we can ſecurely defend and keep the country for one third leſs than what our burthen would be if it was conquered, and ſupport the governments afterward for an eighth of what Britain would levy on us, and could I find a miſer whoſe heart never felt the emotion of a ſpark of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, even that man, uninfluenced by every love but <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

of money, and capable of no attachment but to his intereſt, would, and muſt, from the frugality which governs him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the defence of the country, or he ceaſes to be a miſer and becomes an ideot. But when we take in with it every thing that can ornament mankind; when the line of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt becomes the line of our happineſs; when all that can chear and animate the heart; when ſenſe of honor, fame, character, at home and abroad, are intervoven not only with the ſecurity but the increaſe of property, there exiſts not a man in America, unleſs he be a hired emiſſary, who does not ſee that his good is connected with keeping up a ſufficient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
            <p>I do not imagine that an inſtance can be produced in the world, of a country putting herſelf to ſuch an amazing charge to conquer and enſlave another as Britain has done. The ſum is too great for her to think of with any tolerable degree of temper; and when we conſider the burthen ſhe ſuſtains as well as the diſpoſition ſhe has ſhewn, it would be the height of folly in us to ſuppoſe that ſhe would not reimburſe herſelf by the moſt rapid means, had ſhe once more America within her power. With ſuch an oppreſſion of expence, what would an empty conqueſt be to her! what relief under ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances could ſhe derive from a victory without a prize? It was money, it was revenue, ſhe firſt went to war for, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>that</hi> would ſatisfy her. It is not the nature of ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice to be ſatisfied with any thing elſe. Every paſſion that acts upon mankind has a peculiar mode of operation. Many of them are temporary and fluctuating; they admit of ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and variety: But avarice is a fixed uniform paſſion. It neither abates of its vigour nor changes its object; and the reaſon why it does not is founded in the nature of things, for wealth has not a rival where avarice is a ruling paſſion. One beauty may excel another, and extinguiſh from the mind of a man the pictured remembrance of a former one: But wealth is the phoenix of avarice, and therefore cannot ſeek a new ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, becauſe there is not another in the world.</p>
            <p>I now paſs on to ſhew the value of the preſent taxes, and compare them with the annual expence; but this I ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face with a few explanatory remarks.</p>
            <p>There are two diſtinct things which make the payment of taxes difficult; the one is the large and real value of the ſum to be paid, and the other is the ſcarcity of the thing in which the payment is to be made; and although theſe appear to be one and the ſame, they are in ſeveral inſtances not only dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, but the difficulty ſprings from different cauſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:016919_0008_0F9EC8BEC1EBC2A0"/>Suppoſe a tax was to be laid equal to one half of what every man's yearly income is, ſuch a tax could not be paid becauſe the property could not be ſpared; and on the other hand, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a very trifling tax was laid to be collected in <hi>pearls,</hi> ſuch a tax likewiſe could not be paid, becauſe it could not be had. Now any perſon may ſee that theſe are diſtinct caſes, and the latter of them is a repreſentation of ours.</p>
            <p>That the difficulty cannot proceed from the former, that is, from the real value or weight of the tax, is evident at firſt view to any perſon who will conſider it.</p>
            <p>The amount of the quota of taxes for this ſtate for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent year, 1780 (and ſo in proportion for every other ſtate) is twenty millions of dollar, which at ſeventy for one is but ſixty four thouſand two hundred and eighty pounds three ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings ſterling, and on an average is no more than three ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and five pence ſterling per head per annum men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children, or five pence per head per month. Now here is a clear poſitive fact, that cannot be contradicted, and which proves that the difficulty cannot be in the weight of the tax, for in itſelf it is a trifle and far from being adequate to our quota of the expence of the war. The quit rents of one penny ſterling per acre on only one half the ſtate, come to upwards of fifty thouſand pounds, which is almoſt as much as all the taxes of the preſent year, and as thoſe quit rents made no part of the taxes then paid, and are now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continued, the quantity of money drawn for public ſervice this year, excluſive of the militia fines, which I ſhall take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of in the proceſs of this work, is leſs than what was paid and payable in any year preceding the revolution, and ſince the laſt war; what I mean is that the quit rents and taxes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken together came to a larger ſum then than the preſent taxes without the quit rents do now.</p>
            <p>My intention by theſe arguments and calculations is to place the difficulty to the right cauſe, and ſhew that it does not proceed from the weight or worth of the tax, but from the ſcarcity of the medium in which it is paid; and to illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate this point ſtill farther, I ſhall now ſhew, that if the tax of twenty millions of dollars was of four times the real va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue it now is or nearly ſo, which would be about two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty thouſand pounds ſterling, and would be our full quota, that this ſum would have been raiſed with more caſe, and leſs felt, than the preſent ſum of only ſixty four thouſand two hundred and eighty pounds.</p>
            <p>The convenience or inconvenience of paying a tax in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ariſes from the quantity of money that can be ſpared out of trade.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:016919_0009_0F9EC8BF81620CB8"/>When the emiſſions ſtopt, the continent was left in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of two hundred millions of dollars, perhaps as equally diſperſed as it was poſſible for trade to do it. And as no more was to be iſſued, the riſe or fall of prices could neither increaſe nor diminiſh the quantity. It therefore remained the ſame through all the fluctuations of trade and exchange.</p>
            <p>Now had the exchange ſtood at twenty for one, which was the rate congreſs calculated upon when they quoted the ſtates the latter end of laſt year, trade would have been carried on for nearly four times leſs money than it is now, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the twenty millions would have been ſcared with much greater eaſe, and when collected would have been of almoſt four times the value they now are. And on the other hand, was the depreciation to be at ninety or one hundred for one, the quantity required for trade would be more than at ſixty or ſeventy for one, and though the value of the tax would be leſs, the difficulty of ſparing the money out of trade would be greater. And on theſe facts and arguments I reſt the matter, to prove, that it is not the want of property, but the ſcarcity of the medium by which the proportion of property for taxation is to be meaſured out, that makes the embarraſſment we lie under. There <hi>is not</hi> money enough, and what is equally as true, the people will not let there be money enough.</p>
            <p>While I am on the ſubject of the currency, I ſhall offer one remark which will appear true to every body, and can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for by nobody, which is, that the better the times were, the worſe the money grew; and the worſe the times were, the better the money ſtood. It never depreciated by any advantage obtained by the enemy. The troubles of ſeventy ſix, and the loſs of Philadelphia in ſeventy ſeven, made no ſenſible impreſſion on it, and every one knows that the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of Charleſtown did not produce the leaſt alteration in the rate of exchange, which for long before, and for more than three months after, ſtood at ſixty for one. It ſeems as if the certainty of its being our own made us careleſs of its value, and that the moſt diſtant thoughts of loſing it made us hug it the cloſer, like ſomething we were loth to part with; or that we depreciate it for our paſtime, which, when called to ſeriouſneſs by the enemy, we leave off to renew again at our leiſure. In ſhort our good luck ſeem to break us, and our bad make us whole.</p>
            <p>Paſſing on from this digreſſion, I ſhall now endeavor to bring into one view the ſeveral parts I have already ſtated, and form thereon ſome propoſitions, and conclude.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:016919_0010_0F9EC8C05FBE1170"/>I have placed before the reader, the average tax per head paid by the people in England; which is ſorty ſhillings ſterling.</p>
            <p>And I have ſhewn the rate on an average per head, which will defray all the expence of the war to us, and ſupport the ſeveral governments without running the country into debt, which is thirteen ſhillings and fourpence.</p>
            <p>I have ſhewn what the peace eſtabliſhment may be conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, viz. an eighth part of what it would be, if under the government of Britain.</p>
            <p>And I have likewiſe ſhewn what the average per head of the preſent taxes are, namely, three ſhillings and five pence ſterling or five pence per month; and that their whole yearly value in ſterling is only ſixty four thouſand two hundred and eighty pounds. Whereas our quota to keep the payments equal with the expences, is two hundred and fifty thouſand pounds. Conſequently there is a deficiency of one hundred and eighty five thouſand ſeven hundred and twenty pounds, and the ſame proportion of defect, according to the ſeveral quotas, happens in every other ſtate. And this defect is the cauſe why the army has been ſo indifferently ſed, cloathed and paid. It is the cauſe, likewiſe, of the nerveleſs ſtate of the campaign, and the inſecurity of the country. Now if a tax equal to thirteen and fourpence per head will remove all theſe difficulties, make people ſecure in their homes, leave them to follow the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their ſtores and farms unmoleſted, and not only keep out, but drive out the enemy from the country; and if the neglect of raiſing this ſum will let them in, and produce the evils which might be prevented, on which ſide, I aſk, does the wiſdom, intereſt and policy lie? Or rather would it not be an inſult to reaſon to put the queſtion. The ſum when portioned out according to the ſeveral abilities of the people, can hurt no one, but an inroad from the enemy ruins hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of families.</p>
            <p>Look at the deſtruction done in this city. The many hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes totally deſtroyed, and others damaged; the waſte of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the country round it, beſides the plunder of furniture, forage and proviſion. I do not ſuppoſe that half a million ſterling would reinſtate the ſufferers, and does this, I aſk, bear any proportion to the expence that would make us ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure. The damage on an average is at leaſt ten pound ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling per head, which is as much as thirteen ſhillings and fourpence per head comes to for fifteen years. The ſame has happened on the frontiers, and in the Jerſies, New York, and other places, where the enemy has been, Carolina and Georgia is likewiſe ſuffering the ſame fate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:016919_0011_0F9EC8C10A1636E0"/>That the people generally do not underſtand the inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of the taxes to carry on the war, is evident, not only from common obſervation, but from the conſtruction of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral petitions, which were preſented to the aſſembly of this ſtate, againſt the recommendation of congreſs of the 18th of March laſt, for taking up and funding the preſent currency at forty for one, and iſſuing new money in its ſtead. The prayer of the petitions was, <hi>That the currency might be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciated by taxes</hi> (meaning the preſent taxes) <hi>and that part of the taxes be applied to the ſupport of the army, if the army could not be otherwiſe ſupported.</hi> Now it could not have been poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for ſuch a petition to have been preſented, had the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners known, that ſo far from <hi>part</hi> of the taxes being ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the ſupport of the army, the <hi>whole</hi> of them falls three fourths ſhort of the year's expences.</p>
            <p>Before I proceed to propoſe methods by which a ſufficiency of money may be raiſed, I ſhall take a ſhort review of the general ſtate of the country.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the weight of the war, the ravages of the enemy, and the obſtructions ſhe has thrown in the way of trade and commerce, ſo ſoon does a young country outgrow misfortune, that America has already ſurmounted many that once heavily oppreſſed her. For the firſt year or two of the war, we were ſhut up within our ports, ſcarce venturing to look towards the ocean. Now our rivers are beautified with large and valuable veſſels, our ſtores filled with merchandize, and the produce of the country has a ready market, and an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous price. Gold and ſilver, that for a while ſeemed to have retreated again within the bowels of the earth, is once more riſen into circulation, and every day adds new ſtrength to trade, commerce, and agriculture. In a pamphlet written by Sir John Dalrymple, and diſperſed in America in the year 1775, he aſſerted, that, <hi>two twenty gun ſhips, nay,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the tenders of thoſe ſhips, ſtationed between Albermarle ſound and Cheſapeak bay, would ſhut up the trade of America for</hi> 600 <hi>miles.</hi> How little did Sir John Dalrymple know of the abilities of America!</p>
            <p>While under the government of Britain, the trade of this country was loaded with reſtrictions. It was only a few fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign ports ſhe was allowed to ſail to. Now it is otherwiſe; and allowing that the quantity of trade is but half what it was before the war, the caſe muſt ſhew the vaſt advantage of an open trade, becauſe the preſent quantity under her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions could not ſupport itſelf; from which I infer, that if half the quantity without the reſtrictions can bear itſelf up nearly, it not quite, as well as the whole when ſubject to them, how proſperous muſt the condition of America be when the whole ſhall return open with all the world. By trade I

do not mean the employment of a merchant only, but the whole intereſt and buſineſs of the country taken collectively.</p>
            <p>It is not ſo much my intention, by this publication, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe particular plans for raiſing money, as it is to ſhew the neceſſity and the advantages to be derived from it. My prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal deſign is to form the diſpoſition of the people to ſuch meaſures which I am fully perſuaded is their intereſt and duty to adopt, and which needs no other force to accompliſh them than the force of being felt. But as every hint <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

               </gap> improvements upon it as to them may appear reaſonable.</p>
            <p>The annual ſum wanted is two millions, and the average rate in which it falls is thirteen ſhillings and fourpence per head.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe then that we raiſe half the ſum and ſixty thouſand pounds over. The average rate thereof will be ſeven ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings per head.</p>
            <p>In this caſe we ſhall have half the ſupply we want, and an annual fund of ſixty thouſand pounds whereon to borrow the other million; becauſe ſixty thouſand pounds is the intereſt of a million at ſix per cent. and if at the end of another year we ſhould be obliged, by the continuance of the war, to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row another million, the taxes will be increaſed to ſeven ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and ſixpence; and thus for every million borrowed, an additional tax equal to ſixpence per head muſt be levied.</p>
            <p>The ſum then to be raiſed next year will be one million and ſixty thouſand pounds: One half of which I would propoſe ſhould be raiſed by duties on imported goods and prize goods, and the other half by a tax on landed property and houſes, or ſuch other means as each ſtate may deviſe.</p>
            <p>But as the duties on imports and prize goods muſt be the ſame in all the ſtates, therefore the rate per cent. or in what other form the duty ſhall be laid, muſt be aſcertained and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by congreſs, and ingrafted in that form into the law of each ſtate; and the monies ariſing therefrom carried into the treaſury of each ſtate. The duties to be paid in gold or ſilver.</p>
            <p>There are many reaſons why a duty on imports is the moſt convenient duty or tax that can be collected, one of which is, becauſe the whole is payable in a few places in a country, and it likewiſe operates with the greateſt eaſe and equality, becauſe as every one pays in proportion to what he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes, the people in general conſume in proportion to what they an afford, and therefore the tax is regulated by the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:016919_0013_0F9EC8C29CA7BD38"/>
which every man ſuppoſes himſelf to have, or in other words every man becomes his own aſſeſſor, and pays by a little at a time when it ſuits him to buy. Beſides, it is a tax which people may pay or let alone by not conſuming the articles; and though the alternative may have no influence on their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, the power of chooſing is an agreeable thing to the mind. For my own part, it would be a ſatisfaction to me, was there a duty on all ſorts of liquors during the war, as in any idea of things, it would be an addition to the pleaſure of ſociety, to know, that when the health of the army goes round, a few drops from every glaſs become theirs. How often have I heard an emphatical wiſh almoſt accompanied with a tear, <hi>"Oh, that our poor fellows in the field had ſome of this!"</hi> Why then need we ſuffer under a fruitleſs ſympathy, when there is a way to enjoy both the wiſh and the entertainment at once?</p>
            <p>But the great national policy of putting a duty upon imports is, that it either keeps the foreign trade in our own hands or draws ſomething for the defence of the country from every fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner who participates it with us.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the firſt half of the taxes, and as each ſtate will beſt deviſe means to raiſe the other half, I ſhall confine my remarks to the reſources of this ſtate.</p>
            <p>The quota then of this ſtate of one million and ſixty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds will be one hundred and thirty-three thouſand two hundred and fifty pounds, the half of which is ſixty-ſix thouſand ſix hundred and twenty-five pounds; and ſuppoſing one fourth part of Pennſylvania inhabited, then a tax of one buſhel of wheat on every twenty acres of land, one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, would produce the ſum, and all the preſent taxes to ceaſe. Whereas the tythes of the biſhops and clergy in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, excluſive of the taxes, are upwards of half a buſhel of wheat on <hi>every ſingle</hi> acre of land, good and bad, throughout the nation.</p>
            <p>In a former part of this paper I mentioned the militia fines, but reſerved ſpeaking to the matter, which I ſhall now do: The ground I ſhall put it open is, that two millions ſterling a year will ſupport a ſufficient army, and all the expences of war, and government, without having recourſe to the inconvenient method of continually calling men from their employments, which of all others is the moſt expenſive and the leaſt ſubſtantial. I conſider the revenue created by taxes as the firſt and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal thing, and fines only as ſecondary and accidental things. It was not the intention of the militia law to apply the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia fines to any thing elſe but the ſupport of the militia, neither do they produce any revenue to the ſtate, yet theſe fines amount to more than all the taxes; for taking the muſter

roll to be ſixty thouſand men, the fine on forty thouſand who may not attend, will be ſixty thouſand pounds ſterling, and thoſe who muſter, will give  <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                  <desc> _____ </desc>
               </gap>  portion of time equal to half that ſum, and if the eight claſſes ſhould be called within the year, and one third turn out, the fine on the remaining forty thouſand would amount to ſeventy two millions of dollars, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the fifteen ſhillings on every hundred pounds property, and the charge of ſeven and a half per cent for collecting in certain inſtances, which on the whole would be upwards of two hundred and fifty thouſand pounds ſterling.</p>
            <p>Now if thoſe very fines diſable the country from raiſing a ſufficient revenue without producing an equivalent advantage, would it not be to the eaſe and intereſt of all parties to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the revenue, in the manner I have propoſed, or any better, if a better can be deviſed, and ceaſe the operation of the fines. I would ſtill keep the militia as an organized body of men, and ſhould there be a real neceſſity to call them forth, pay them out of the proper revenues of the ſtate, and encreaſe the taxes a third or fourth per cent. on thoſe who did not attend. My limits will not allow me to go farther into this matter, which I ſhall therefore cloſe with this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark; that fines are, of all modes of revenue, the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuited to the mind of a free country. When a man pays a tax, he knows the public neceſſity requires it, and therefore feels a pride in diſcharging his duty; but a fine ſeems an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for neglect of duty, and of conſequence is paid with diſcredit, and frequently levied with ſeverity.</p>
            <p>I have now only one ſubject more to ſpeak to, with which I ſhall conclude, which is, the reſolve of congreſs of the 18th of March laſt, for taking up and funding the preſent curren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy at forty for one, and iſſuing new money in its ſtead.</p>
            <p>Every one knows I am not the flatterer of congreſs, but in this inſtance <hi>they are right;</hi> and if that meaſure is ſupported, the currency will acquire a value, which without it, it will not. But this it not all: It will give relief to the finances until ſuch time as they can be properly arranged, and ſave the country from being immediately double taxed under the preſent mode. In ſhort, ſupport that meaſure, and it will ſupport you.</p>
            <p>I have now waded through a tedious courſe of difficult buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and over an untrodden path. The ſubject on every point it could be viewed was entangled with perplexities, and inveloped in obſcurity, yet ſuch are the reſources of America, that ſhe wants nothing but ſyſtem to inſure ſucceſs.</p>

                  <pb n="15" facs="unknown:016919_0015_0F9EC8C408C76020"/>P. S. While this paper was preparing for the preſs, the treachery of General Arnold became known, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed the attention and converſation of the public; and that, not ſo much on account of the traitor as the magnitude of the treaſon, and the providence evident in the diſcovery. The matter, as far as is at preſent known, is thus briefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</p>
               <p>General Arnold about ſix weeks before had obtained the command of the important poſt of Weſt Point, ſituated on the North river, about ſixty miles above New York, and an hundred below Albany, there being no other defenceable paſs between it and the laſt mentioned place. At what time, or in what manner, he firſt entered into a negociation with the enemy for betraying the fort and garriſon into their hands, does not yet appear.</p>
               <p>While Arnold commanded at Weſt Point, General Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington and the miniſter of France went to Hartford in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut, to conſult on matters, in concert with Admiral Terney commander of the French fleet ſtationed at Rhode Iſland. In the mean time Arnold held a conference with Major Andre, Adjutant General to General Clinton, whom he traiterouſly furniſhed with plans of the fort, ſtate of the garriſon, minutes of the laſt council of war, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which he would poſt the troops when the enemy ſhould attempt a ſurpriſe; and then gave him a paſs, by the name of Mr. John Anderſon, to go to the lines at the White Plains or lower, if he Mr. Anderſon thought proper, he being (the paſs ſaid) on public buſineſs.</p>
               <p>Thus furniſhed, Andre parted from Arnold, ſet off for New York, and had nearly arrived at the extent of our lines, when he was ſtopped by a party of militia, to whom he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced his paſs, but they, not being ſatisfied with his account, inſiſted on taking him before the commanding officer Lieut. Col. Jamieſon. Finding himſelf in this ſituation, and hoping to eſcape by a bribe, he offered them his purſe, watch and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of any quantity of goods they would accept, which theſe honeſt men nobly and virtuouſly ſcorned, and conſiſtent with their duty took him to the proper officer. On exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation there was found on him the above mentioned papers and ſeveral others, all in the hand writing of General Arnold, and finding himſelf thus detected, he confeſſed his proper name and character; he was accordingly made a cloſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, and the papers ſent off by expreſs to Weſt Point, at which place General Waſhington had arrived ſoon after the arrival of the packet. On this diſcloſure, he went in queſt of Arnold, whom he had not ſeen that day, but all that could be learned was, that Arnold had received a letter ſome ſhort time before, which had much confuſed him, ſince which he had diſappeared. Colonel Hamilton, one of General Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington's aids, with ſome others were ſent after him, but he
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:016919_0016_0F9EC8C4D257CD00"/>
having the ſtart eluded the purſuit, took boat under pretence of a flag, and got on board the Vulture ſloop of war lying in the North river; on which it may be truly ſaid, that one vulture was receiving another. From on board this veſſel he addreſſed a letter to General Waſhington, which, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever light it may be viewed, confirms him a finiſhed villain.</p>
               <p>The true character of Arnold is that of a deſperado. His whole life has been a life of jobbs; and where either plunder or profit was the object, no danger deterred, no principle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained him. In his perſon he was ſmart and active, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what diminutive, weak in his capacities and trifling in his converſation; and though gallant in the field, was defective in the talents neceſſary for command. The early convulſion of the times afforded him an introduction into life, to the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of which he was before a ſtranger, and the eagerneſs of the public, to reward and encourage enterprize, procured him at once both applauſe and promotion. His march to Quebec gave him fame, and the plunder of Montreal put the firſt ſtamp to his public character. His behaviour at Danbury and Saratoga once more covered over his crimes, which again broke forth in the plunder of Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, under pretence of ſupplying the army. From this time, the true ſpring of his conduct being <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> he became both diſregarded and diſeſteemed, and this laſt inſtance of his treachery has proved the public judgment right.</p>
               <p>When we take a review of the hiſtory of former times, it will turn out to the honor of America, that, notwithſtanding the trying variety of her ſituation, this is the only inſtance of defection in a general officer; and even in this caſe the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken honeſty of thoſe who detected him heightens the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional character, to which his apoſt<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> ſerves as a foil. From the nature of his crime, and his diſpoſition to monopolize, it is reaſonable to conclude he had few or no <hi>direct</hi> accomplices. His ſole object was to make a monied bargain; and to be conſiſtent with himſelf, he would as readily betray the ſide he has deſerted to, as that he deſerted from.</p>
               <p>But there is one reflection reſults from this black buſineſs, that deſerves notice, which is, that it ſhows the declining power of the enemy. An attempt to bribe is a ſacrifice of military fame, and a confeſſion of inability to conquer; as a proud people they ought to be above it, and as ſoldiers to deſpiſe it; and however they may feel on the occaſion, the world at large will deſpiſe them for it, and conſider America ſuperior to their arms.</p>
