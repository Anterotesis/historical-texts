            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>I very well remember that the Court was pleaſed to tell the Jury, after they had been together ſome days, and not being agreed upon the Verdict, <hi>That if they were under any Difficulty whether the Overt Acts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>I therefore humbly offer, in arreſt of Judgment, That if the Overt Acts laid in the Indictment were admitted to be proved, yet in point of Law they cannot amount to High-Treaſon, within the meaning of the Act of Aſſembly upon which the Indictment is laid.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="unknown:001038_0039_0FAEF1BF233C3F98"/>
For I take it that all Acts of Parliament, and conſequently Acts of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, are to be underſtood and taken by reaſonable Conſtruction, to be gathered and collected out of the words of the Act only, and that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the natural, grammatical, plain and legal Senſe thereof, without any forc'd Interpretation.</p>
               <p>Then if ſo, this Act of Aſſembly both by the Title, Preamble, and the Enacting part thereof, plainly demonſtrates the meaning of the Law-makers, and what was thereby deſigned for the future to prevent. The Title of this Act is in theſe words, <hi>An Act for the Quieting and Settling the Diſorders that have lately happened within this Province, and for eſtabliſhing and ſecuring their Majeſties preſent Government againſt the like Diſorders for the future.</hi> Now what theſe Diſorders were, we have great cauſe to remember, and they are very well known to this Court to have been occaſioned by ſome Perſons ſetting up an Arbitrary Power over the Kings Subjects with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Authority from the Crown of <hi>England</hi> as appears from the Preamble of the ſaid Act, part whereof is in theſe words, <hi>And whereas the late haſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>From hence it plainly appears, that the Intention of the Law-makers was only to declare ſuch Perſon or Perſons Rebels and Traytors as ſhould, for the future ſet up a Power over his Majeſties Subjects in this Province, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Authority from the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> which undoubtedly is Treaſon within the Statute of 25 <hi>Edw</hi> 3</p>
               <p>But it can never he underſtood, (without the greateſt of Violence to the reaſonable Conſtruction of the ſaid Act of Aſſembly, &amp; the plain Intention of the Makers thereof) to be conſtrued to extend to the ſigning the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes mentioned in the Indictment, which is the only thing the Priſoner is poſitively charged withal; for all the reſt are only preſumtive, conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and accumulative Crimes drawn from thence.</p>
               <p>But, ſays <hi>Mr Solicitor,</hi> the words of this Act of Aſſembly are in generals, <hi>That if any Perſon ſhall endeavour by force of Arms, or Otherwiſe to diſturb the peace, good and quiet of the Government, ſhall be deemed and eſteemed Rebels and Traytors.</hi>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Emot,</hi> Theſe Authorities which you have here cited, its true, are grounded upon the Statute which you have mentioned of 12 <hi>Ed</hi> 2. but this Statute has only relation to Writs, and in this caſe the Sheriff ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned the Jury not by virtue of a Writ, but a Precept under the hands of the Commiſſioners, which differs the caſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Emot</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Solicitor,</hi> Then you ſay that the caſe at the Bar is not within the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ords of this Stat. 12 <hi>Ed</hi> 2 for that this is a Precept to ſummon the Jury, and not a Writ, and to conſequently the Sheriff not obliged to ſign and return the ſame. A very wiſe Diſtinction.</p>
               <p>However, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew, that this Precept is within the Reaſon and Equity of the Statute, and that the ſame ought to be returned and ſigned by the Sheriff In order thereto I ſhall put this Court in mind, how Statutes have from time to time been taken by Equity in divers manners, that thoſe things which are alike in Reaſon, are alike in Law; and that where an Act of Parliament hath been made to remedy ſome Miſchiefs, that the ſame hath been extended to other things in like Degree, and that even in Penal Law. <hi>As for Example:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stat. of Glouceſter. cap. 5</hi> By this Statute, an Action of Waſte is given againſt one who holds for years; yet by the Equity of this Statute, a man ſhall have an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Weſtm 2. cap. 3.</hi> This Statute gives an Action of <hi>cui in vita,</hi> after the Coverture diſſelved by Death, Yet if the Coverture be diſſolved by Divorce; the Wife ſhall have, by the equity of this Statute, a Writ of <hi>cut <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>And laſtly, the <hi>Stat. 25 Edw. 3. de proditionibus,</hi> This Statute expreſſly ſays, That no caſe ſhall be taken by equity unleſs it be adjudged in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and yet by the equity of the words of that Statute, which are, <hi>If the Servant kill the Maſter,</hi> it is taken, <hi>If the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>So that from hence I am humbly of Opinion, That we are fairly within the Equity of this <hi>Stat. 12 Edw.</hi> 2. Beſides, a Writ and Precept in this Caſe are only S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </sp>
            <p>Theſe Reaſons were Over-ruled.</p>
            <p>And the Court ordered the Sheriff to make a Return upon the Precept to ſummon the Jury, conform to the above <hi>Stat. 12 Edw.</hi> 2. which the Court ſaid they had power to do, and to help that Defect.</p>
