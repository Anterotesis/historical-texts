            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And this Suſpicion being ſtrengthned by other Circumſtances, it made ſuch a deep Impreſſion on my Mind, that I was not eaſy all Night; but conſidering how long it would be before I could obtain his Majeſty's Writ, <hi>De homine replegiando,</hi> I went the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Mr Mayor, for a Warrant, and an Officer to go on board the <hi>Ruby</hi> Man of War, to ſearch her before ſhe was ſail'd out of the Liberty of the City; and accordingly his Worſhip ſent the Water-Bailiff, with proper Aſſiſtance, and full Power and Inſtructions to ſearch the Ship for Sir <hi>John Dinely.</hi>

               <p>Sunday, Jan. 18, about Seven at Night, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain brought his Brother, Sir. <hi>John.</hi> on board, and convey'd him down to the Purſer's Cabin, by Force: When he was down, the Captain ask'd <hi>Whether the Cabin was clear</hi> (for that the <hi>Thurſday</hi> before the Murder, the Captain had orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me to get the Purſer's Cabin ready for a Gentleman who was coming on board:) I anſwer'd, <hi>Yes, Sir</hi>: Then he open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Door, and the People of the Ship forc'd Sir <hi>John</hi> in, he groaning, all the while. When he was in, the Captain call'd for his Steward, and told him to bring a Bottle of Rum and a Glaſs: The Captain ask'd Sir <hi>John, How he did?</hi> Sir <hi>John</hi> complain'd of Pains, eſpecially in his Thigh: The Captain ask'd him, <hi>If he would drink a Dram?</hi> Sir <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

then ask'd him, <hi>If he would have any Rum to bathe his Thigh?</hi> Sir <hi>John</hi> anſwer'd <hi>No:</hi> Then the Captain order'd a Dram for <hi>Mohony</hi> and <hi>Eliſha Cole</hi> (who was the Perſon at firſt deſign'd to have done the Murder, but that he was drunk:) After they had a Dram, they all came out of the Cabin. Then <hi>Cole</hi> deſir'd Leave to ſpeak to the Gentleman (Sir <hi>John</hi>) thinking he was the Captain of the Ship he was preſſed out of: <hi>Cole</hi> went in, and told Sir <hi>John, he did his Duty on board the</hi> Charles <hi>as well as another Man,</hi> and ſwore he would have his Wages: Sir John told him, <hi>He did not know him, nor any thing of the</hi> Charles: On which he again ſwore, he would have his Wages before he went out of the Ship; for that if he was not the <hi>Captain,</hi> he was the <hi>Owner.</hi> Shortly after <hi>Cole</hi> went out; when the Captain call'd one of the Carpenter's to put <hi>two ſtrong Bolts on the Purſer's Cabin Door</hi>; which was accordingly done. About this Time Sir John ask'd, If he could ſpeak with any one of the Officers on board: The Carpenter made Anſwer, <hi>I am the Carpenter</hi>: Sir <hi>John</hi> ask'd if he could ſpeak a Word with him? He reply'd, <hi>a Hundred if he pleaſed.</hi> Then the Carpenter ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Door, in order to clench the Staples, Sir <hi>John</hi> ask'd him, <hi>What his Brother</hi> Sam. <hi>was going to do with him? What, is he going to murder me?</hi> The Carpenter reply'd <hi>No, He is willing to have your Company, Sir; he does it for your Good:</hi> Sir <hi>John</hi> ſaid, <hi>But what will become of all my Servants and Eſtate all this Time?</hi> On this the Carpenter retir'd: And preſently after the Captain came down again, and order'd the Doctor's firſt Mate to go to <hi>feel his Pulſe,</hi> ſaying, <hi>We muſt patch him up as well as we can, he is a crazy old Man: Go, in,</hi> ſays he, <hi>and feel his Pulſe</hi>: Accordingly the Docter went in, and when he came to Sir <hi>John,</hi> he asked him, Where his Pains were? He anſwer'd, <hi>He lately came from</hi> Bath, <hi>and had a Pain in his Head;</hi> and complain'd of many other Pains, occaſion'd by the rough Uſage in bringing him on board.

Brother Sailors I have almoſt forgot my Sea Terms, let me have a Bucket to Piſs in, and eaſe myſelf, for it will be a Shame to do it in the Cabin.</hi> Upon this I look'd out at the Cabin Door, and call'd out to the Centry to get ſomething for the Gentleman to eaſe himſelf in: And preſently afterwards <hi>Mahony</hi> came with a Bucket; when Sir <hi>John</hi> told him of his Exploits, and that he had been Captain of an <hi>India Man,</hi> &amp;c. About Two or Three in the Morning my Wife waked me: And I heard a vaſt Struggling at firſt, and the old Gentleman to cry, <hi>Twenty Guineas! Take it! Take it! Muſt I die! Muſt I die!</hi> And very ſoon after, all was quiet. Then a Candle was handed into the Cabin: And I ſaw, thro' the Crevace of the Partition, <hi>Mahony</hi> holding the Candle in his Hand, and <hi>White</hi> plunder'd his Pockets, turning his Body in order to come at it, and took out of his Pocket his Watch and Money. But <hi>White</hi> not getting the Watch out of Sir <hi>John</hi>'s Pocket eaſily, <hi>Mahony</hi> ſaid to him, <hi>D—n it, lay hold of the Chain:</hi> It was ſome Time before they could get the Watch out of his Pocket, being forced at laſt to unbutton his Breeches. <hi>White</hi> put his Hand into one Pocket, and found nothing but Silver, &amp; putting his Hand into the other, ſaid, <hi>Here it is:</hi> Then he put his Hand in another Pocket, and found a Piece of Paper, which he was going to read; but <hi>Mahony</hi> damn'd him, and bid him put it in his Pocket, and not ſtand to read it now. In about a Minute after, I ſaw a <hi>white Hand</hi> on the Throat of the Deceaſed, which I took to be the Captain's Preſently they all went out of the Cabin, and left the Deceaſed alone Then I went to the Doctor's Mate and the Centry; and, by their Opinion, they took: the Gentleman to be dead: Then I went to the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant and told him what I had <hi>heard</hi> and <hi>ſeen,</hi> and that <hi>Mahony</hi> and <hi>White</hi> had murdered the Gentleman, and that I believed the Captain was concern'd. The Lieutenant was very dubious of the Truth at firſt, telling me, he did not

think the Captain would be guilty of any ſuch Thing; but, on my giving him ſuch plain Demonſtrations of the Thing, he began to think there was ſomething in it. While they were talking, the Midſhipman came to acquaint the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, that the Captain had order'd <hi>White</hi> and <hi>Mahony</hi> aſhore: He ſwore they ſhould not go aſhore, for that they were the two Perſons that had kill'd the Gentleman; but the Midſhipman returning to the Captain, he order'd they ſhould be put aſhore immediately; and accordingly they were. About Nine or Ten in the Morning, the Lieutenant and Gunner contrived a Method, that I ſhould go in and complain I had loſt ſix Guineas out of my Cheſt: Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly going with this Complaint, I ſeiz'd the Captain as he was walking with his Hands behind him: And the reſt who were at Hand ruſh'd in after me. Upon the Captain's being thus ſeiz'd, he cry'd out, <hi>Hay!

Sir <hi>John</hi> told him, No; he would bid as he was: At this Time Sir <hi>John</hi> did not talk much, but told his Brother, <hi>He would rot in a Jail</hi>: On this the Captain bid <hi>Mahony</hi> ſee if he had any Knife about him; When Sir <hi>John</hi> took a little Knife out of his Pocket, and gave it to <hi>Mahony,</hi> and went and laid himſelf upon the Bed directly: Then the Captain went out, ſaying to his Brother, He would go and ſee for ſome Sheets for him; and as the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain went out, he ſpoke aloud, and charg'd (I ſuppoſe the Centry) that no one ſhould come near him; <hi>for that by and- by he'd kick and tear, and make a Noiſe, as tho' he would tear the Cabin down; for that he was a Madman:</hi> Then the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain went out and ſat in the Doctor's Birth, ſaying to Mr. <hi>Marſh</hi> the Midſhipman, <hi>You muſt go aſhore in the Morning between three and four o'Clock,</hi> and alſo order'd him to go to the Poſt-Office for the Letters: That if any Body made Enquiry about the <hi>Old mad Fellow,</hi> he ſhould tell them, <hi>That he had brought him on board to prevent his rotting in Jail: In ſhort,</hi> (continued he) <hi>the World has blamed me, that I have not done it before:</hi> About Twelve, Sir <hi>John</hi> asked <hi>Mahony</hi> for the Knife; <hi>for what does my Brother think I am going to make away with my ſelf?

                  <hi>Jan.</hi> 13. 1740, the Captain ordered the Barge and Yawl up, (in each of which was a Midſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) and ordered a Midſhipman and ſix of the Bargemen to go to the Sign of the <hi>White-Hart,</hi> the Foot of the <hi>College-Green:</hi> When we came there I ſaw the Captain, <hi>Mahony,</hi> and five of the Privateer's Men, who were drinking hot Flip by themſelves, while myſelf &amp; the five Bargemen were ſitting in the publick Kitchen drinking of Ale: Shortly after, I ſaw Sir <hi>John</hi> come from Mr. <hi>Smith</hi>'s oppoſite the <hi>White-Hart,</hi> where his Man was waiting for him, with Piſtols to each of their Horſes: Then the five Privateer's Men ſeeing him, they ruſh'd out together, and were for ſeizing Sir <hi>John</hi> then; but the Capt. ordered them not to touch him at that Time, but to follow him, and ſee which Way he went: Then they followed him round the Corner, and the Captain after them: But the Captain return'd to the <hi>White Hart</hi> again in about an Hour, and ordered the Boat down.—</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sunday</hi> following, the 18th of <hi>January,</hi> the ſame Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman I ſaw on the Green, was brought on board the <hi>Ruby</hi>; and as he was bringing on board, the Captain bid the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>mind not what he ſaid, for that he was a Madman, and he
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004809_0016_100DF438CDA0CCD0"/>
would bring him to his Senſes by and by.</hi> I ſaw no more of him for this Time. But at 12 o'Clock I was call'd to go Centry over Sir <hi>John</hi> in the Cock-Pit at the Purſer's Cabin-door; a little after 12, the Captain ſent his Man for me: I gave the Centry at the Gun-Room Charge, that no Body ſhould come down the Ladder till I had ſpoke with the Captain: When I went into the Captain's Cabin, I ſaw the Captain and <hi>Mahony</hi> with a Bottle of Rum and Glaſs before them, out of which I had a Dram. Then the Captain ask'd me, <hi>If his Brother made any Noiſe?</hi> On which I told him, that he made a little Moan for the Time that I was there. The Captain reply'd, <hi>I know the Reaſon of that, he is wet, he wants to be ſhifted; I will come down and ſhift him with dry Stockings preſently:</hi> When I went out, the Captain told me to let no body into the Purſer's Cabin to Sir <hi>John,</hi> but <hi>Mahony.</hi>—Says <hi>Mahony, You may let another go in becauſe</hi>— here he went no further. About Two the Captain came down to the Cock Pit, and ask'd me, if his Brother made any Noiſe? and liſtned himſelf at the Cabin Door, to hear if he made any Noiſe.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>John</hi> made a little Moan: And the Captain ſaid to me, <hi>Centry, give me the Sword, and you go upon Deck, becauſe I want to talk to my Brother privately by himſelf:</hi> Accordingly I gave him the Sword, and went up into the Gun Room, and there walk'd: A little after, down came <hi>Mahony,</hi> and the Centry ask'd where he was going? He ſaid, <hi>D—n you, you Dog, what is that to you? D — n you, how buſy you make yourſelf!</hi> Then <hi>Mahony</hi> went down (where the Captain wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

his Hand; at my Approach the Captain held his Sword to my Breaſt, and told me to keep back, ſaying, <hi>Stay where you are:</hi> Accordingly I went back, and walk'd for a ſmall Space of Time in the Gun Room: The Captain came to the Foot of the Ladder with the Candle out and gave it to me, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling me to light it and come down: Accordingly I lighted the Candle and went down, when he gave me the Sword, and bid me take his Poſt, locking and bolting the Purſer's Cabin-Door, putting the Key in his Pocket, (which before the Murder, was left in the Cabin-Door) telling me, <hi>If I heard his Brother make any more Noiſe, to ſend to him, and let him know of it.</hi>

               <hi>William Mac. Gennis</hi> ſwore, That he ſaw the Captain ſtand at the Purſer's Cabin Door at the Time of the Murder, with a drawn Sword in his Hand; and that when he offer'd to draw near him, the Captain held up his Sword, and bid him keep back.</p>
            <p>The Captain in his Defence pleaded the utmoſt Innocence; alledging, That could it be thought he could be guilty of the Murder of his Brother Sir <hi>John,</hi> whereas, by his Death, he loſt at leaſt 40,000 l? That the Sickneſs and Diſorder in the Houſe, debarr'd him of his Lawyers and Friends con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with him: That he apply'd to the Captain of the <hi>Ruby</hi> as ſoon as he was allow'd Pen, Ink, and Paper, for Evidences on Ship-board (which were Lieutenant <hi>Perry,</hi> the Doctor, Mr. <hi>Robert Haythorn,</hi> Mr. <hi>Richard Wilſon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hugh Driſcal:</hi>) That he had applied to the Lords of the Admiralty, who ſent him an Order, but the ſaid Ship ſail'd the Day before it arriv'd; which debarr'd him of juſtifying himſelf, they being material Evidences: — In Vindication of his cauſing Sir <hi>John</hi> to be ſeized in the Manner he was, he urg'd, That he was a Lunatick, and therefore, he did it to take care of him: That his being taken in the Day-time on board, was plain, there was no ſecret Deſign, or that he was to have any Harm come to him: And that even when he parted with him at Mr <hi>Smith's,</hi> he behav'd in a very mad Manner and took no Leave.—That the People on board knew of his coming a Week before he came; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004809_0018_100DF43D5DF7E000"/>
he intimated that he muſt be very ſilly to bring a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to 300 Evidences to commit a vile Act, where nothing can be a ſecret above 4 Hours. The Perſons Mr. <hi>Goodere</hi> brought to prove Sir <hi>John</hi> a Lunatick were two young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, one of whom believed him to be a Lunatick, or mad, becauſe he would get up in the Middle of the Night, and diſturb all the Servants; that ſometimes he would buſy himſelf in <hi>hanging on the Pot,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Another Perſon was called to prove Sir <hi>John</hi> had made his Will ſeveral Months before, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And being ask'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Diſpoſition of Sir <hi>John,</hi> he reply'd, That he was a good Friend, a loving Neighbour, and a kind Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord; that he was ſo far from being a Lunatick, as to be capable to negociate his own Affairs with his Tenants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Gentleman was call'd by Mr. <hi>Goodere,</hi> to his Character; but being ask'd whether he knew Sir <hi>John</hi> to be any Ways mad, or the like? He declar'd, That he was ſo far from being a Lunatick, that he had more Senſe than all the whole Family. Sir John was alſo prov'd by Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> to be in his perfect Senſes when he left his Houſe.</p>
