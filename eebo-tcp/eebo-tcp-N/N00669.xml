            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And from the Experience that men have had of theſe
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000812_0005_0FAA56F378C9A4B8"/>
Benefits, as well as from Gods Over-ruling Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon their Hearts, it comes to paſs, that there is ſuch a willingneſs and Diſpoſition in the moſt, to ſubmit to thoſe Powers that God in his Providence placeth over them.</p>
            <p>Indeed we read of thoſe that <hi>Deſpiſe the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2 10. who, in defiance of this Subjection, <hi>Speak Evil of Dignities</hi>; [And what Ordinance of God is there, that hath not met with ſuch as dare deſpiſe and condemn it?] Yet that many, even of Theſe, [whatever their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and willfulneſs, (which infamous Notes the Apoſtle doth there brand them with,) may prompt them to ſay, or do againſt Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſpecifically conſidered, or rather againſt the Perſon veſted with it,] are not ſo void of common Underſtanding, as to condemn ſuch Authority in General; appeareth, (if from no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reaſon, yet at leaſt) from the over wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conceit they ordinarily have, of their own Abilities, to rectifie the Male-Adminiſtrations of thoſe that are in Authority, and ſo mend the Faults, they accuſe the Government of, had they but their Advantages.

The want of which Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, (whether we underſtand it of a total Failure, or of an undue, lame, and ineffectual Management) hath ever been of fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and opened a Gap for Ruin upon Ruin to break in upon a people.

            <p>Now, by how much greater the Bleſſing of Civil Government is (which is deſigned for the Prevention and Removal of thoſe Grievances that are incident to men) by ſo much the more intollerable is it, when it is either not improved at all, or not to any good purpoſe or effect, or miſ-improved; when, either Wit or Will to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the Ends of Rule are wanting; and ſuch as have the managing of it, are either Unskilful, &amp; know not; or Weak, and cannot; or perverſe and will not conſult the Peace and Weal of thoſe they bear rule over.

            <p>This is it which the Prophet in our Text ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, to be the miſerable caſe of the State of <hi>Judah</hi>; They that once had Men of Piety, Wiſdom, Truth and Majeſty, to adorn the Throne of Soveraignty, and Seats of Juſtice, were brought to that deplorable paſs, that they had not a ſtrong Rod to Rule them. And this was, to all that underſtood the worth of ſo great a Mercy, or ſhould feel the want of it, ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſorrow, that we have it ingeminated by the Prophet. <hi>This is a Lamentation, and ſhall be for a Lamentation.</hi>

Civil Affairs of that Kingdom (already ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed) ſhould come to, after <hi>Zedekiahs</hi> Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which was now at Hand. Concerning which (to ſhew the certainty of it) the Prophet here ſpeaks of it as already come: <hi>And Fire is gone out,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which hath devoured her Fruit</hi>: verified conſiderably by what they dayly ſaw and ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; but afterwards, more in thoſe horrid Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, Murders and Confuſions, that fell out in <hi>Gedaliah's</hi> Time; whom <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Governour over the Reſidue of the <hi>Jews,</hi> permitted to abide in the Land.</p>

This is the Summ of the firſt part of the verſe; And belongs, as to its Application, to the three Kings or Princes, preceding <hi>Zedeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> (all of them groſs Idolaters:) And eſpecially to <hi>Zedekiah's</hi> revolting from, and afterwards refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to ſubmit to the King of <hi>Babylon</hi>; (as the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> counſelled him: <hi>Jer.</hi> 38.17, 23.)

            <p>The Figurative Terms in the latter part of the verſe are obvious; and need not much to be ſaid for their Explication. I ſhall add what is needful in a few words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rod.</hi>] The ſame word is rendred <hi>Staff.</hi> The word according to the Notation of it, ſignifieth a Thing to Lean upon.

So <hi>the Staff of Bread,</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.26. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4.16. is that ſupply of ſuch Kind, which a Perſon or People hath dependance upon, and cannot ſubſiſt without: Hence it ſig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Rods</hi> were an Ancient Badge of thoſe that were in Authority. Whence the ſame word ſignifieth <hi>a Tribe. Pſal.</hi> 78.7. Becauſe every <hi>Tribe</hi> had a <hi>Rod,</hi> with the Name of that <hi>Tribe</hi> on it, which the Princes of the <hi>Tribes</hi> uſed to carry in their Hands as Enſigns of their Authority. So that by <hi>Rods,</hi> we are to underſtand Perſons in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; the Adjunct being put for the Subject.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scepter.</hi>] Is a word of the ſame Import: A <hi>Scepter</hi> is a Mark of Majeſty and Severity which Kings of old, as well as now, were wont to uſe. Yet it is not to be reſtrained to Kingly Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on only: (<hi>in Amos</hi> 1.8. It is uſed concerning the State of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> which was <hi>Ariſtocrati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cal</hi>:) And it ſignifieth, by the ſame <hi>Metonymie,</hi> any Power or Majeſty, of Government or Rule, under what form or Name ſoever. This then explaineth the former word; <hi>No Rods for a Scepter; i. e.</hi> Men in Authority, or Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for the Term <hi>Scepter</hi> is no where applied to any other kind of Government exerciſed by Men over one another.</p>

            <p>But, How ſo? Was not <hi>Zedekiah</hi> King? And had he not Officers under him? This Difficulty will eaſily be removed, by conſidering the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of theſe <hi>Rods</hi>; which the Prophet adds; and is principally to be taken notice of, and obſerved here. <hi>Rods</hi> they had, but not <hi>Strong Ones.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>No Strong Rod.</hi>] or Rod of ſtrength. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly applyed to Kings &amp; Kingdoms, which are for the moſt part, won and held thereby. This the Prophet adds to compleat the Deſcription of thoſe, whoſe help the ſtate wanted: and that very agreeably with the Metaphor of a Rod or Staff, here uſed. If a Staff have no ſtrength in it, it will prove but a Deceit, Cheat and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment, to whomſoever make uſe of it: it is its ſtrength that makes it Serviceable. The ſame is true alſo, in this figurative uſe of the Word; or of thoſe whom the Prophet here ſtileth Rods. Whatſoever is requiſite to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh Thoſe that bear Rule, that the ſtate may ſafely have dependance upon them; and without hazard lean upon their Conduct, whether it be Wiſdom, Juſtice, Piety, Proweſs; that is the ſtrength of theſe Rods, the Prophet here ſpeaks of. And it is evident, he ſpeaks of them under this Conſideration (<hi>viz.</hi> as ſo accompliſhed) for men in Authority there were; <hi>Zedekiah</hi> was now King; after him the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pointed <hi>Gedaliah</hi> Governour; (the time was no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

yet come for <hi>the Scepter to depart from Judah, Gen.</hi> 49.10.) But theſe Rods, were not ſtrong ones; accompliſhed for their places, and the Service of their Generations.</p>
            <p>Thus you have the Prophet's Repreſentation of their calamitous Circumſtances. Next follows his Reflection upon them. <hi>This is a Lamentation</hi>] It is a word that ſignifyeth the deepeſt <hi>Mourning,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.16. But how was this a Lamentation? It was ſo, both. (1.) <hi>Formally.</hi> It was of it ſelf ground of great Sorrow; That a State, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ce famous and flouriſhing, and (which is more) ſo peculiarly favoured of God above all others, ſhould be thus caſt down to the Ground. <hi>v.</hi> 12. (2.) <hi>Effectively.</hi> It would open a Gap to numberleſs Ruins; which both they that now lived ſhould ſmart under; and they alſo ſhould rue, who were yet unborn.</p>
            <p>It is, and ſhall be for a Lamentation: noting both the <hi>Certainty</hi> and <hi>Duration</hi> of theſe Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Sorrows. For evils that come in at the Door of a Weak, Remiſs, Lax Government, don't uſe to be ſpeedily turned out again.</p>
            <p>So you have the caſe of this People opened (ſo far as concerns their Civil State) and you have it lamented as very ſorrowful. Whoſoever ſhall look back to the times of King <hi>David,</hi> with thoſe next following, and, ſhall take a view of the Conqueſts of that Reign; of Enemies ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued; Cities taken; Countries ſubjected; People made tributary; Religion and Juſtice flouriſhing;
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000812_0015_0FAA56FC87D0E678"/>
and the Nation formidable to all that were round about them; together with the peacefull Policy and Glory of <hi>Solomon</hi> his Son and Succeſſor; and ſhall conſider further, what all this was at length come to, in the times of our Prophet, through the grievous Sins, and groſs Imprudence, of the higheſt Ranks and degrees of men accompanied with the wretched Degeneracy of the whole People (a natural conſequent of the former) will without Heſitation ſubſcribe to this of the Prophet; and acknowledge it to be juſt matter of Lamentation. It were enough to make a ſenſible mans heart ake, to compare the <hi>Miſeries</hi> of this time wherein the Prophet wrote, with the <hi>Glories</hi> of the former.</p>
            <p>Theſe things, are they not written for our Learning? Certainly, It is an obvious Truth that from hence lies before us; <hi>Viz.</hi> That no great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Miſery can well befall a People (conſidered in their politick Capacity) than to be deſtitute of ſuch Rulers as the Prophet here ſpeaks of; or to be under the Government of others. It is this that the Prophet here Laments, as that which was and would be, a dreadful inlet to undoing Evils. And conſequently, the happy ſtate of a People, is hence inferred, who have Strong Rods for Scepters to rule them.</p>
            <p>This is the Leſſon; And we ſhall be happy, if we can learn it from the Harms of others, and not our own. <hi>Faelix quem faciunt aliena Pericula cautum.</hi>

And ſurely, tho' there are a great many Good men, who would make but poor Rulers; yet it can't be rationally thought, that ſuch as han't the Fear of God ruling in their own hearts, are qualified as they ought to be for the weighty Charge of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Let us nextly in a Word or two, conſider the Second Branch of the Deſcription: their <hi>Fidelity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They must be faithful in their Places.</hi> This is alſo requiſite, to render Rulers ſuch Bleſſings to their People. If men hold Offices of never ſo great Advantage to Serve the Publick, and are never ſo well accompliſhed for them; yet, if they are not induſtrious to improve thoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments, and careful to make uſe of thoſe advantages; they not only do no Good themſelves, but (which is a double wrong) they take up the Room from, and ſo prevent others, who have as good Qualifications, and would
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:000812_0026_0FAA5706F73B9278"/>
make a good uſe of them. But (on the other hand) The Fidelity of Rulers crowns their Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and makes it to be both ſeen and honoured of all.</p>
               <p>Let me here inſtance in a few things, wherein this Fidelity of Rulers ſhould, and will be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. It will be ſeen in:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A ſedulous applying themſelves to the Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k of their Office.</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.8. <hi>He that ruleth, let him rule with Diligence.</hi> And it is as needful in Civil, as in any kind of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Whatever it is, that God calls us to Serve him in, we are to wait upon that thing. And a Heathen could ſay; <hi>Spartam quam nactus es, hanc orna.</hi> Civil Rulers are (by the Ordinance both of God and man) not only ſet apart <hi>from,</hi> but ſet <hi>above</hi> others, for a Special and Honourable Service; which cannot therefore with a good Conſcience be neglected. King <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> gave this Inſtruction in ſpecial, with the Commiſſion he had granted to thoſe Judges that were to ſet at Jeruſalem, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.9. <hi>Thus ye ſhall do</hi>: q. d. mind the thing that you have now in Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and let it be done without fail. And for this reaſon, God hath provided, that ſuch as thus Serve the Publick, ſhould have not only the Honour of Reverence, but alſo of Tribute; <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.6. <hi>For this cauſe pay you Tribute alſo; for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>very Thing.</hi> That, as the former relates to the Dignity; ſo the latter ſhould honourably ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:000812_0027_0FAA5707B1250A18"/>
them, and ſupply the neceſſities ariſing from that attendance. Thus, the ſame right that Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers have to theſe civil Dues, Tribute, or Salary, (call it by which name you pleaſe) than which right, nothing can be more indiſputable, as being the expreſs command of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.7; The ſame reaſon have they to attend to that Service which acquires it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>A diligent Enquiry into all Cauſes depending before them.</hi> The Judges ſaith <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deut. 19.18. <hi>ſhall make diligent Inquiſition</hi>; and <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>chap.</hi> 29.16. <hi>The Cauſe that I knew not, I ſearched out</hi>; yea, <hi>It is the Honour of a King to ſearch out a matter. Prov.</hi> 25.2. And before this is well done, before conſideration had, and Examination made, of all Witneſſes and Circumſtances, Proofs and Pleas (with whatever elſe may be worthy of it, or ſerve to give Light in the Caſe) It is not ſafe but ſhameful to determine any thing <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.13. <hi>He that anſwereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and ſhame unto him.</hi> The Truth many times lies deep, and can't be diſcovered without this courſe be taken, and diligently followed. This therefore is none of the leaſt difficult parts of a Rulers Task; it requires a great deal, both of pains and patience, and muſt be undergone. There is the <hi>Onus,</hi> as well as the <hi>Honos,</hi> the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then as well as the Honour of Government; &amp; they that will not bear the one, are not worthy to wear the other. When ſuch men as have the Rule of others, are either ſlowthful in the Buſneſs

which belongs to them as ſuch, or careleſs about it, and (<hi>Gallio</hi> like) value not whether Matters go right or wrong, ſo they can but Serve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and get rid of the trouble of being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned with them, they are not only injurious to particulars, but the very diſgrace of their Places, ſo long as they hold them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>An upright and impartial Judging in every Cauſe occurring:</hi> not warp'd in the leaſt, from the ſtreight Rule of Juſt and Right, either by Flattery or Bribery, Favour or Affection.

Whatever Difference in reſpect of Dignity there may be between the Parties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the Juſtice to be Adminiſtred, yet Juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice remains one and the ſame; and the Law by which it is to be Adminiſtred, ought to be duly regarded, and kept unto; and not bow'd and bent on every turn, as may ſerve Occaſion: This will maintain the Honour of the Laws, &amp; of him who Executes them; whereas if this be n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And for men to violate that thing (whatſoever it be) which is committed to their Care, is among the higheſt Notes of Infidelity. Good and Faithful Rulers, will be far from thinking, that their Authority (which is to ſuppreſs Evil in others) ſerveth as a Diſpenſation to themſelves, to be, and do as they pleaſe. They will not eſteem themſelves at ſuch a liberty; or think that they are as much above the <hi>Law</hi> they are to Rule <hi>by,</hi> as they are above <hi>thoſe</hi> they are to Rule <hi>over.</hi> But, they know that (conſidering the Places they ſtand in) it doth as much concern them, to approve themſelves worthy Patterns of all Holineſs Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and Obedience, as to puniſh the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="30" facs="unknown:000812_0030_0FAA5709FB7ECA08"/>
And that therefore, they can never be honeſt in their Places, unleſs they labour to be Inſtances of that Reverence themſelves, which they expect all others ſhould ſhew to the Laws under their Adminiſtration. And (to add no more) when they that ſhould be a Terror to Evil Doers, ſet themſelves up for an Example to them; and do the very things, that they ſhould bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt in others, we may be ſure, <hi>The Wicked will walk on every ſide Pſal.</hi> 12.8. without Fear either of God or man. But when thoſe that are in Authority, do by their own Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, practically honour the Laws they admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, this is not only an Encouragement to thoſe that do well, but a Terrour to all that do otherwiſe; and utterly takes away the Hope of Impunity from the moſt preſumptuous. For this Inſtance of a Rulers Fidelity is the beſt Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that he hath taken up <hi>Davids</hi> Reſolution. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.10. <hi>To cut off all the Horns of the Wicked</hi>; and <hi>that he will not bear the Sword of Juſtice in vain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſee, who are the <hi>Strong Rods</hi>; and what it is makes them ſo: Wiſe and Juſt, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious and Pious Rulers: Devoting themſelves to the work or their Office, diligently enquiring into, and impartially judging in Cauſes depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and of Exemplary Converſation.</p>
               <p>It remains that we ſhew them to be rich Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings.</p>
               <p>And that we may make a right Eſtimate of
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:000812_0031_0FAA570AD0216500"/>
the worth of ſuch men, and come to know what Bleſſings they are to the Publick; we may <hi>firſt</hi> conſider, wherein the Publick Weal conſiſts; and <hi>then</hi> what Influence they have upon it: And from their Serviceableneſs to that great End of Government, we may fairly compute what value we ought to put upon them. Wherein this Weal doth lie, the Apoſtle tells us, 1 Tim. 2.2. <hi>viz. in a quiet and peaceable life in all Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Honeſty.</hi> In which words, he points out to us the two great things, that are the grand Intereſts of a People; <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Property.</hi> When a people have the liberty of profeſſing the True and Orthodox Faith of the Goſpel, and of Worſhipping and Serving the Lord in the ways of his own Appointment, according to the preſcription of his bleſſed Word; &amp; when a people may enjoy their proper Rights and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, according to Gods Laws and their own; when they have that liberty ſecured to them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Invaſions of Error, Profaneneſs and Superſtition; and theſe Rights and Priviledges maintained both againſt the Annoyances of a Foreign Power, and againſt the Attempts of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick Oppreſſion, Fraud and Violence, ſo that as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, Pſal. 144.14. <hi>There is no breaking in, nor going out, nor complaining in their Streets.</hi> Then they enjoy this Quietneſs and Peace, in all Godlineſs and Honeſty; <hi>And that People is happy, that is in ſuch a caſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now therefore, if it can be evinced, that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:000812_0032_0FAA570BEA931028"/>
and Faithful Rulers, are the great means un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God, for the attaining theſe great ends of Government, and for the procuring and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing this Happineſs: the matter will be out of all doubt; and that People muſt be confeſſed happy, that have ſuch to rule them. And here.</p>
               <p>Whoſoever ſhall well weigh the Condition of a People under other Circumſtances; whether we conſider them as wholly deſtitute of Rulers; or their Rulers deſtitute of ſuch Qualifications; ſhall never want Conviction in this Particular.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For, <hi>As to the firſt of theſe Caſes,</hi> viz. <hi>When it is the condition of a People to be deſtitute of Rulers</hi>; their caſe is woful. The Conſequents of Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy are ſo manifeſtly fatal to the whole and to particulars, that the very Authors of it, have bluſh'd to be it's Advocates. Nature it ſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows us not to imagine, that the Civil Felicity of a People can ſubſiſt without Government. Whatever Diſſatisfaction men have conceived, againſt the Powers that are, they are rather a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>the Perſon,</hi> than the <hi>Authority</hi>: Yea, they, that being weary of any preſent Powers, are given to Change, do ever pretend to hope for better; which ſhews, that the Neceſſity of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to the common Good of a People, is ſuch a concluſion of the Light of Nature, as cannot be concealed, no not in the moſt Diſaffected. And (which brings to the other caſe) the ſame Light that commends ſome Government as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, condemns a bad one.</p>

And what can be expected from ſuch, but the Ruin of a People? They don't know, or if they do, they will not regard the Intereſt of the Publick; and be ſure, <hi>will never Expoſe themſelves in the Defence of it.</hi> They have more advantage than others to wrong the Publick, and as little conſcience as any, to reſtrain them. <hi>Theſe are they that will juſtify the wicked for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and take away the Righteouſneſs of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous from him.</hi> Iſa. 5.23. inſtead of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I ſhall not need to enlarge much in ſo plain a caſe. Give me leave to add two or three Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations further, concerning thoſe Rulers in ſpecial that have been characterized in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; and I come to the Application.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider, <hi>Such Rulers will ſtudy and promote thoſe things that make for the Weal of their People</hi>; and in this regard are rich Bleſſings to them. It was for their ſake as well as his own, that <hi>Solomon</hi> in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1.10. begg'd Wiſdom of God; <hi>Prudentiam Regitivam,</hi> that he might <hi>know to go out, and come in before his People.</hi> They know that for this end, God hath given them their Promotion, with all the advantages that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it; and that unleſs they do accordingly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it, they ſhall never be able to yield an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Price that is in their Hands; they eſteem the <hi>Salus Populi,</hi> the Publick Good, to be one of the Chief <hi>Subordinate Ends</hi> of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;

and that whoſever doth not faithfully endeavour the ſame, can never attain the <hi>Ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.</hi> And though the Lord hath advanced them above their Fellow Creatures, and made them Gods among (&amp; in a ſence over) men; yet they will remember that they are <hi>Ministers for their Good; Rom.</hi> 13 4. And accordingly do whatſoever lies in their Power, that it may be advanced under their management; that if God bleſs them therein, they may live the Deſire of their People; their Deaths, whether Civil or Natural, be lamented; or their Memories Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider, <hi>As they have the greatest Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to keep out, and to keep off Evil from their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; ſo they will diligently and vigorouſly improve it.</hi> They may do much (none more) to ſhut the Door againſt approaching Evil. And they will do as much as they can; eſpecially the greateſt Evil of Sin, which opens the Door to all the reſt they will conſcientiouſly oppoſe, not only by ſtrict Laws, and ſevere Puniſhments; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, by labouring to be ſuch a Pattern of Piety themſelves, as ſhall be a powerful Incentive to the well-minded, and as great a dread to thoſe that are otherwiſe.

And when at any time the Wall of Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection about a People is broken down, theſe are the Men <hi>to Stand in the Gap, to repair the Breach</hi>; and they may, by their Zeal for Gods Glory, ſeaſonably ſhewn, in a ſuitable Witneſs-bearing againſt the crying Sins that kindled the Lord's Anger, turn away his Wrath from ſuch a People.

But yet, let all this be ſuppoſed of a People, it is all nothing, if ſuch Rulers as theſe I am ſpeaking of be wanting.

<pb n="38" facs="unknown:000812_0038_0FAA571238FAA798"/>
one that reads the Chronicles of thoſe times with Obſervation.</p>
               <p>To this therefore I ſhall add only theſe two or three Particulars, wherein you may ſee the Lord commending able and faithful Rulers to us as rich Bleſſings, and condemning others as ruinous.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is recommended in Deut.</hi> 1.13. and <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.21. to all that have the liberty and power of Electing Civil Rulers, that in their deſignation of Perſons to Places of Authority, they ſhould have ſpecial regard to their being ſo qualified. And that which then contributed to the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a People, cannot now be thought to croſs it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Lord gives ſuch Rulers in Mercy to a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> In 2 <hi>Chron</hi> 9.8. It is ſaid concerning <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; Becauſe thy God Loved Iſrael<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to eſtabliſh them for ever, therefore made he thee King over them, to do Judgment and Juſtice.</hi> It was a bleſſed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that God ſupported his people with, when they were languiſhing under the miſeries of a Government, not regarding the Adminiſtration of Juſtice; <hi>That he would reſtore them Judges as at the firſt, and Counſellers as at the Beginning; Iſa.</hi> 1.26. <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua; David</hi> and <hi>Solomon.</hi> And when ſuch as theſe are removed from a People, their caſe is awful, and God threatens it as a ſore Judgment. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.1, 2.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>God ſends other Rulers in wrath to a People. I gave thee a King in mine anger</hi> ſaith the Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:000812_0039_0FAA5712F5E4A950"/>
                  <hi>Saul; Hoſ.</hi> 13.11. And again <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.4. God threatens that People with this Curſe, <hi>I will give Children to be their Princes, and Babes ſhall rule over them.</hi> Dreadful are the conſequents of this mentioned in the next verſe. <hi>The people ſhall be oppreſſed every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: The Child ſhall behave himſelf proudly againſt the Ancient, and the baſe againſt the honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> In a word, Violence and Inſolence will bear down all before them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Able and Faithful Rulers have the Promiſe of God's Preſence and Bleſſing</hi>: Prov. 29.14. <hi>The King that faithfully judgeth the Poor, his Throne ſhall be eſtabliſhed for ever.</hi> 2 Chron 19 <hi>ult. Deal Couragiouſly, and the Lord ſhall be with the good.</hi> And God in bleſſing them, bleſſeth the whole People. When their methods are Prudent, their aimes Right, their endeavours Vigorous, their hearts Valiant, their hands Strong, and God is pleaſed to be Crowning them with Succeſs; the Publick will reap the benefit. It is ſaid, <hi>Judges</hi> 2.7. <hi>The People ſerved the Lord all the days of Joſhua. Joſhua</hi> faithfully endeavoured it, and God ſmiled upon his endeavours; God was with him, and the People flouriſhed in Piety and Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity: but it was not long after <hi>Joſhua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>) as that which you ought to attend to. If you would not this day, do that which will be for a Lamentation to this People, and remain ſo. <hi>Let your Care then be, to Elect ſuch as may be Able for their Places, and Faithful in them.</hi> Don't think your Voices are ſo your own, that you may beſtow them upon whom you will, meerly becauſe you will. Let not that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty you have, be abuſed to an undoing Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs. Beware of thoſe corrupt and ſiniſter Ends, which are too too apt to blind your Judgments, and biaſs your Affections, from the Rule thus ſet before you. I ſhall but hint at ſome of them.</p>
               <p>There are ſome (of plauſible pretences indeed but ungoverned Spirits) who in Affairs of this nature, conſult only their own Humours; and chooſe for ſuch as they hope will moſt indulge them. Theſe had rather they ſhould be in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, then ſuch as have Wiſdom and Spirit to controul them; &amp; if they have any ſecret Grudge againſt a man of Worth, beſure it ſhall weigh
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:000812_0043_0FAA5715F1D73B48"/>
heavier with them than all his Accompliſhments.</p>
               <p>Some are wholly Swayed by the Favour they have received from, and the Friendſhip and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance they have with theſe and thoſe men; they think it but a point of Civility, to Vote for ſuch as have been civil, kind, and obliging to them: But we ought to conſider that our <hi>good Friends</hi> may be <hi>poor Patrons</hi> of the Common-Weal; they may be as bad Counſellers for the State, as <hi>Jobs</hi> were Comforters to him; Good men ſhould have other ways to expreſs their Gratitude to their Friends, than by the publick Injury; and <hi>(if it muſt needs be ſo) we had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor diſguſt them, than do that which is worſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some don't ſo much conſider the man, as the Party he belongs to; if he be but of ſuch a ſort or ſet of men, that is the principal Recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation they look at; this alone is enough with them, to cover a multitude of Infirmities, and as many Sins; whereas the greateſt Worth, if it be on the other ſide, is wholly ſlighted.</p>
               <p>Some look at nothing ſo much as Faction, and would with their good wills, have none to ſway the Scepter of Government, but ſuch as will be ſticklers for, and ſtrenuous promote<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But ſurely theſe, (and all ſuch as theſe) are pernicious Ends and Deſigns, to be abhorred by
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:000812_0044_0FAA5716AEA31640"/>
all thoſe that are Well willers to the Common-Weal; and to be avoided by all that have any Intereſt in the Electing of Perſons to any Places of Civil Power. Don't think therefore, that you have nothing to do in this Election, but to pleaſe your ſelves, or gratifie your Friends, or maintain a Party, and uphold a Faction; But</p>
               <p>Remember, <hi>That God hath intruſted you with an Advantage of being Inſtrumental to procure Rich Bleſſings to this People.</hi> The Rulers that are this Day to be ſet over you, will be ſo far ſuch, as they ſhall anſwer the Character that hath been given: And you are bound in Conſcience both to God and his People, (deteſting the baſe Ends mentioned) to pitch upon thoſe, concerning whom, you ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Suffer then the Exhortation, I beſeech you in the words of the Lord, which you have in <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Be ſtrong O Zerubbabel and work</hi>: Do the work of your publick Capacities, with Prudence, Honour and Fidelity: <hi>I am with you ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> Thus if you approve your ſelves, it will be Honour to God, your Comfort, our Weal, and the rejoycing of all that love God &amp; his People.</p>
               <p>There are a few things, which I would crave your Patience (Honoured and much Reſpected) that I may briefly recommend unto you; as need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be much in your Eyes, and upon your Hearts, if you would thus acquit your ſelves; &amp; be Strong Rods to us at ſuch a Day as this.</p>

This is both our <hi>Decus &amp; Tutamen</hi>; we may truly ſay of this great Article, that it is, <hi>Articulus ſtantis et cadentis Nov. Angliae.</hi> It is this that engageth the Lord to deal graciouſly with his people, and to be their Saviour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.7. When the Church had reckoned up the Loving-kindneſſes of God, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ways expreſſed; we have in the following verſe the conſideration intimated, upon which the Lord proceeded in doing thoſe great things for his people, verſe 8. <hi>For he ſaid, ſurely they are my People, Children that will not lie, ſo he was their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; q. d.</hi> They will not be falſe to my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, they will walk in my ways, and keep my Commandments, they will remember their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements and fulfil them; and upon their ſo doing, he had and would ſhew them his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. In this way they might hope for it; but if they ſhould prove lying, unholy, backſliding Children, they would but deceive themſelves to expect it. Upon this ground hath the Lord been proceeding with our Fathers in time paſt; and upon the ſame will he deal with us at this Day. If we conſider the things that were at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, when God firſt laid the Foundations of Goſpel work in theſe Ends of the Earth; if we remember the Wonders of old, which we have heard, and our Fathers have told us; we may ſay of thoſe Providences, whereby God through

many Difficulties, brought a Remnant of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful People into theſe remote corners of the World, planted and preſerved them here, as <hi>David</hi> doth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.7. That the Lord did it; <hi>By his Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>becauſe he had a favour for them.</hi> By great Deliverances and Salvations did the Lord manifeſt his Preſence among them, and Loving-kindneſs to them: and they were all upon this account<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Pſal</hi> 22.4. <hi>Our Fathers truſted in thee; they truſted, and thou didſt deliver them.</hi> They had Holineſs to the Lord Engraven upon their hearts, deſigns, and ways, and God was with them. If we are true to this Intereſt and Cauſe of God, and walk in the Covenant of the Lord God of our Fathers, it ſhall be well with us. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.6. But if there be a declining, backſliding, apoſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Spirit in us; if we give the Lord cauſe to take up that Complaint concerning us, in <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Even from the dayes of your Fathers, ye are gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from mine Ordinances, and have not kept them.</hi> Oh! what Preſumption, what Madneſs will it be for us to hope, that as he was theirs, ſo he will be our Saviour. Alas! How many are there that have forgotten &amp; forſaken this great Intereſt of the Lord among us? Be you intreated therefore (who ſhall have the rule of this People) to conſider it, and engage your hearts to the advancing of it. Remember that there is a Solemn Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God &amp; this his People; God hath taken them to be his, &amp; they have owned themſelves to be the Lords; upon this Foundation ſtand all our

Mercies, Priviledges, Enjoyments, &amp; whatſoever can contribute any thing to our preſent or future Felicity: and therefore the recovering of us from all our Apoſtaſies, and the maintaining &amp; promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ſerious Godlineſs among us, ſhould &amp; will be the chief Scope of ſuch Rulers, as make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to Serve either God, or his People.</p>

If they that go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a People go out of this way, ſad Experience proves it but too natural a practice for them to follow their Leaders. So <hi>Jeroboam the ſon of Nebat made Iſrael to Sin.</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 16 26. He led the Dance and he had the far greateſt part of a Nation to follow him. If you dont make <hi>much</hi> of theſe things, others will make <hi>light</hi> of them: If you violate in never ſo ſmall a Degree the Honour of Sacred things, others will be kept within no Bounds: it will be encouragement enough to them, if they have any hope to be tolerated in their prophaneſs; but it will be much more, if they have ſuch as ſhould puniſh it for a <hi>Preſident.</hi>

We ſhall never loſe by what we lay out for that Intereſt of Chriſt's Kingdom; but the ſtarving of this Intereſt, hath brought a Curſe upon a People. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.9, 10, 11, 12. And becauſe many of the Paſſages in this Text do ſo directly point at ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Lords humbling Diſpenſations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, I cannot but mention it at large, <hi>Ye are Curſed with a Curſe, for you have robbed me, even this whole Nation.

And all Nations ſhall call you bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: for ye ſhall be a delightſome land, ſaith the Lord of hoſts.</hi> Whatever Policy was in it, it was one of <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Sins. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13.33, 34. <hi>That he took of the loweſt of the People, and made them Prieſts</hi>: And certainly it will be found a Sin too, when a courſe is taken to make thoſe that are ſeparated to the Service of God, the meaneſt among a People. To prevent which, tho' ſome things may have been worthily done, yet it is well worthy our Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether the Experience we have had of the unſuccesfulneſs of thoſe meaſures that have been

already taken, doth not call for ſomething farther to be done: And the ſad paſs things of this nature are already come to in ſome places, doth awaken to as quick a diſpatch as may be. How long the price (the Liberty &amp; Authority for this) which you now have, will be in your hands, the Lord only knoweth: And beſides, when things are once going down hill, the further they go, the harder it is to ſtop them. We may rationally look that if what is amiſs in a matter of ſo great Concernment as this, both to our ſelves and ours, be not rectified ſpeedily, it will grow worſe and worſe, and be beyond all Remedy at laſt.</p>

There's a ſort of Bribery more groſs by gifts; &amp; there's another ſort more private &amp; ſubtil, when men by ſecret arts and flatteries do whee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and inſinuate themſelves into the Affections; which, whenſoever it takes, is as great a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the Dignity of Magiſtracy, and tends as much to the corruption of Judgment, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting of Juſtice and Right, as any.
