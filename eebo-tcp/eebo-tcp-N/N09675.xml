            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE office of a miniſter of Chriſt, as it is a moſt weighty, ſo it is as trying a lot as any that mortals were ever employed in. They are made a ſpectacle unto the world, to angels and to men: All eyes are upon them, and if they are faithful they will be hated and envied by many. Thus is has been in all ages. The great apoſtle of the Gentiles, though one of the moſt faithful and exemplary men that ever lived, was traduced in the famous church of Corinth, as a whiffling and inconſiſtent perſon, not to be regarded; and though rational beings muſt ever allow, that a wiſe man may alter his purpoſe for good seaſons, yet the apoſtle's doing ſo, and not coming to them as he had propoſed, is catch'd.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012316_0004_0F8A204B476737C8"/>hold of to ſupport theſe ſlanders. Their evil in ſo doing is plainly expoſed in the firſt chapter of this epiſtle; where we may alſo note, that the abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and wickedneſs that many practiſe to this day, of connecting the goſpel itſelf with the character of it's preachers, is as old as the apoſtles time; for, becauſe Paul had acquainted them with his deſign of viſiting them, but had not done it, deceitful men not only inſinuated that he was a falſe man, but that his preaching was ſo too; <hi>yea and nay,</hi> inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency and nonſenſe not to be regarded, as if the weakneſs or iniquity of men were any argument againſt the truth of God! This conduct is a glar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proof of what all men are naturally inclined to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, namely, that they are rebels againſt heaven; for it is a maxim with ſubjects, <q>That their King can do no wrong;</q> thereby imputing the evils that are done, to his miniſters and ſervants: Whereas in the caſe before us, the KING of heaven is blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed, his goſpel and his ſervice ſlighted, under the covert of the hypocriſy of others. And all thoſe who can make the weakneſs or evils of teachers or profeſſors an excuſe for their own neglect of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, are in ſome meaſure guilty of this madneſs; for let men be ever ſo imperfect or falſe, Chriſt and his goſpel is eternal truth; therefore all thoſe that do not receive the ſame, implicitly ſay, <q>We will not have this man to reign over us.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As there curring to the evils of others to excuſe our own neglect, is a falſe way, ſo it often happens with thoſe who go therein, that what they alledge againſt others is not true; which was the caſe here And after a juſt vindication of the apoſtle and his
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012316_0005_0F8A204D1445A2E0"/>companion, he begins this chapter with aſking the Corinthians, if there was any need of epiſtles of commendation to or from that church in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, ſince the ſaving effects of their miniſtry re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in indelible characters, written in their hearts by the Spirit of the living God? Where teachers are not known, they need epiſtles of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation to introduce them, which is an apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic cuſtom, and which many in our day have not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently regarded, Acts 18.27. But when perſons have experienced the ſaving power of their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that gives a greater confirmation of their divine miſſion, than human letters can do. However, though the apoſtle improves this evidence to ſilence gainſayers, he would not have any think that they had any ſufficiency in themſelves for this work; no, not ſo much as to <hi>think any thing as of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:</hi> Not to regulate their thoughts, or form any juſt concluſions. But ſays he, <hi>All our ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency is of God, who alſo hath made us able miniſters of the New-teſtament, not of the letter but of the ſpirit; for the letter killeth, but the ſpirit giveth life.</hi> In which words you naturally obſerve, who it is that makes goſpel miniſters, the ſubject of their miniſtry, and the effect of it: Each of which I ſhall endeavour briefly to explain and improve on this occaſion, as aſſiſtance may be granted.</p>
            <p n="1">I. You obſerve, it is God that makes able mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. This perhaps none will deny; but the grand queſtion is. How he does it? I anſwer, Firſt, he does it by making them <hi>new creatures.</hi> This is ſo eſſential to the very nature of their work, and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012316_0006_0F8A204DF159B290"/>ſo plainly revealed in the ſcripture, that if it were not for the prejudices of education and carnal intereſt, if would be needleſs to ſtand to prove it. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. A principal part of their work is to labour to <hi>reconcile</hi> ſinners to God; and to imagine any one to be fit for that work, who is not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled himſelf, is one of the firſt-born of abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities. All know that the more gifted or crafty an enemy is, the more he is to be avoided and guarded againſt, inſtead of being encruſted with our moſt weighty affairs: And what in it ſhort of blaſphemy, to pretend that the moſt High will do ſo! Our apoſtle ſays, <q>All things are of God, who hath <hi>reconviled us</hi> unto himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt, and hath <hi>given to us the miniſtry of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conriliation,</hi> chap. 5.18.</q> This is God's order; he firſt reconciles the perſon, makes him a <hi>new creature,</hi> as in the preceding verſe, and then grace him the miniſtry of reconciliation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of their work is <hi>ſpiritual;</hi> and how can <hi>carnal</hi> men perform it? Our Lord aſſured a maſter in Iſrael that, <q>Except a man be <hi>born again,</hi> he <hi>cannot ſee</hi> the kingdom of God:</q> And If he cannot <hi>ſee</hi> it, how can he act In it as he ought? The natural man <hi>receiveth</hi> not, neither can be <hi>know</hi> the things of the Spirit of God, and for this reaſon, becauſe they are <hi>ſpiritually diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.14. Reaſon will teach us that, <q>Simple ideas are only to be got by thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions objects themſelves make on our minds, by the proper inlets appointed to each fort; and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012316_0007_0F8A204E42C76530"/>if they are not received this way, all the words in the world, made uſe of to define, or explain any of their names, will never be able to produce in us the idea it ſtands for.</q> As for inſtance, the true idea of light and colours cannot be had but by perceiving them with our ſight; without which an ingenious blind man could get no nearer the idea of <hi>ſcarlet,</hi> than that <q>It was like the ſound of a trumpet. <note n="*" place="bottom">LOCKE's eſſay on underſtanding. 6.3. chap. 7. S. 11.</note>
               </q> And revelation informs us, that the way by which the ſpirit of truth guides his people into all truth, is by receiving of the things of Chriſt, and <hi>ſhewing</hi> the ſame <hi>unto them,</hi> John 16.13, 14. The <hi>vail</hi> remains on mens hearts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the ſpirit takes it away, and gives them with <hi>open face</hi> to behold the divine glory, whereby they are <hi>changed into the ſame image,</hi> context ver. 14—18.</p>
            <p>Miniſters are to comfort others by the comfort where with <hi>they themſelves are comforted of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.4. They are to lead others in a way they are acquainted with, and ought to be able to ſay, <hi>We ſpeak that we know, and teſtify that we have ſeen.</hi> Experimental knowledge is ſo neceſſary that even our great high Prieſt himſelf, though he were a ſon, yet learned he obedience by the things that he ſuffered; and being tempted, he was able to ſuccour them that are tempted. I would illuſtrate this point by a familiar inſtance: We are not far from <hi>Cape-God,</hi> which is well known to be a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous coaſt for ſeamen, ſo that it is an eſtabliſhed cuſtom for all that go round it to take a pilot. Now ſuppoſe a man of good ſenſe, who had ſeen exact charts of every point, rock or quick-ſand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the coaſt, and had all the intelligence that books
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012316_0008_0F8A204EF90F8370"/>or men could give him about them, yet had never ſeen them himſelf; who will venture round the Cape with ſuch a pilot? Don't each one rather give in to the old maxim, that, <hi>nothing teaches like experience?</hi> Yet in the caſe before us many are ſo far from allowing it, that we have maſters in our Iſrael, who would take it as an affront to be aſked, whether they had experienced the new-birth or not?</p>
            <p n="3">3. No man can act from any higher principle than <hi>ſelf,</hi> until he is born from above; yet as ſurely as Chriſt ſpeaks true, no man <hi>can</hi> be his diſciple, (how much leſs his miniſter?) except he <hi>deny himſelf,</hi> and take up his croſs and follow Chriſt. Men may, and often do, deny one luſt to gratify another; may croſs luxury to gratify covetouſneſs, or croſs covetouſneſs to indulge luxury or ambition: Yea, may in ſome ſenſe croſs all theſe to eſtabliſh ſelf-righteouſneſs; yet ſtill they get no higher than ſelf; they do not deny ſelf, therefore ſuch cannot be fit to be Chriſt's miniſters; for his miniſters preach <hi>not themſelves,</hi> but Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, and themſelves the church's ſervants for Jeſus ſake. And the way they are brought to this is, <hi>God who commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined in their hearts,</hi> to give the light of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his glory. This, and this only can and doth give them to act from more noble principles, than ſelf-ſeeking and ſelf-righteouſneſs: It enables them to preach by <hi>faith,</hi> and in their conduct to look to things <hi>unſeen, which are eternal,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.5, 6.13.18. Hence,</p>
            <p n="4">4. All allow the miniſters work to be very great and difficult, in which they have ſpecial need of divine
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012316_0009_0F8A204FB41269F0"/>help; and to thoſe whom Chriſt ſends, he ſays, <hi>Lo, I am with you;</hi> and they are to be ſtrong in the grace that is in him: But how can that be without union with him, even as the branch has with the vine? Without which he aſſures us that we <hi>can do nothing;</hi> and the words before our text tell us that <hi>all our ſufficiency is of God.</hi> How far he may gird thoſe who know him not for particular purpoſes, I leave; but how can any ſoul plead for promiſed aſſiſtance without faith, for <hi>how ſhall they call on him in whom they have not believed?</hi> Rom. 10.14.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſince men muſt be reconciled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, before they can heartily ſeek for others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation to God; ſince it is neceſſary to be ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually taught in order to teach others ſpiritual things, and to be ſupernaturally enlightened in order to act above ſelf, and to have acquaintance with, and a truſt in Chriſt, in order to plead his promiſed aſſiſtance; how clear is the evidence that he makes men new creatures in order to make them his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters? If any ſhould alledge <hi>Judas</hi> againſt this, I would only aſk, whether they think his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample was for imitation, or for warning? If they think for imitation, then how many <hi>traiters</hi> muſt we have? If for warning, then let us take it, and beware of ſuch men. And by the way I would have them remember that <hi>Judas</hi>'s commiſſion was limited to the <hi>national</hi> church; the pure goſpel commiſſion was given to the <hi>eleven,</hi> after Judas was gone to his own place, Mat. 10.5, 6. and 28.16, 10. If to evade all this any will ſay, we cannot know who are born again and who not. I reply, that our Lord has told us, <hi>that</hi> we ſhall know them,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012316_0010_0F8A20507B5A4E30"/>and <hi>how</hi> we ſhall know them, Mat. 7.15, 16.— Luk. 6.44, 45. And if men do not believe him, ſtill he abides faithful, he cannot deny himſelf.</p>
            <p>I therefore proceed to obſerve, that he makes miniſters by giving <hi>ſpecial gifts</hi> for that work. I am as far as any man from ſuppoſing that renewing grace, is the only qualification neceſſary for a goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel miniſter. When our Lord aſcended on high he <hi>gave gifts</hi> unto men, among which were gifts for <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> Eph. 4.8, 11. Special giſts both to underſtand, and to communicate divine things to the inſtruction and edification of others; and the command is, <hi>As every man hath received the gift, even ſo miniſter,</hi> &amp;c. Let the gift be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by more public or more private means, there is no limitation as to that, but every man that God has given the gift to, be commands them to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the ſame as <hi>good ſtewards</hi> of his manifold grace; and by his Spirit he teaches them their duty in this reſpect, as I have more largely ſhewn elſewhere. <note n="*" place="bottom">Diſcourſe on an internal call to preach the goſpel.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Once more, God makes able miniſters, by teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and inclining his people to call and ſet apart to public office thoſe whom he has prepared therefor. As he has commanded each one to improve the gifts that are given to him, ſo he has granted to his people an unalienable right to judge of ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, for miniſters are not lords over their faith, but helpers of their joy; and Paul himſelf ſays, to the church of Corinth, <hi>I ſpeak as to wiſe men, judge ye what I ſay.</hi> And another church is commended by their glorious Head, becauſe they had tried them
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:012316_0011_0F8A20514EB3BF88"/>that ſaid they were apoſtles and were not, and had found them liars, Rev. 2.2.</p>
            <p>There hath been much contention both formerly and lately about the ſucceſſion of miniſters, and of miniſterial authority; but I think Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> in the laſt century, has ſtated this matter to good purpoſe: Says he, <q>The office of the miniſtry for the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of the church-ſtate, and adminiſtration of all ordinances of worſhip unto the end of the world, is ſufficiently ſecured, (1.) By the law, conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and appointment, of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, erecting that office, and giving warrants for it's continuance to the conſummation of all things, Mat. 28.20. Eph. 4.13. (2.) By his continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance according unto his promiſe to communicate <hi>ſpiritual gifts</hi> unto men, for the miniſterial edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the church. That this he doth ſo continue to do, that it is the principal external evidence of his abiding in the diſcharge of his mediatory office. (3.) On the duty of believers, or of the church, which is to chooſe, call, and ſolemnly ſet apart unto the office of the miniſtry, ſuch as the Lord Chriſt, by <hi>his Spirit,</hi> hath made meet for it, according unto the rule of his word. And thoſe who plead for the continuation of a <hi>ſucceſſive</hi> miniſtry, without reſpect unto theſe things, without reſolving both the authority and office of it unto them, do but erect a <hi>dead image,</hi> or embrace a dead carcaſe, inſtead of the living and life giving inſtitutions of Chriſt. They take away the living creature, and ſet up a <hi>ſkin ſtuffed with ſtraw.</hi>

II. To conſider the ſubject of their miniſtry, which in our text is deſcribed both negatively and poſitively. They are miniſters not of the <hi>letter</hi> but of the <hi>ſpirit;</hi> and to explain the letter, the law <hi>written and engraven in ſtones</hi> is named, the tenor of which is, <hi>If a man do them, he ſhall live in them;</hi> but <hi>curſed is every one that doth them not,</hi> Levi. 18. 5. Gal. 3.10, 12. which is therefore here called, the <hi>miniſtration of death,</hi> becauſe no man upon earth doeth thoſe precepts, the penalty then is the certain conſequence. This is the letter; but from the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles mentioning that which is <hi>done away,</hi> and that which is <hi>aboliſhed,</hi> it appears that the ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al law is alſo included, which, though a ſhadow of good things to come; yet the letter of it enjoined a multitude of offerings and works to be done by that people, enforced with terrible penalties on thoſe who did them not. Indeed the whole miniſtry of <hi>Moſes</hi> is intended, which was very <hi>glorious,</hi> and ſhined with great luſtre in the manner of giving the law, and in the many tokens that were given of his being taught and owned of God in his miniſtrations, yet when <hi>Moſes was read</hi> by the Jews, the <hi>vail</hi> was ſo upon their hearts, that they could not <hi>ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly look to the and of that which is aboliſhed.</hi> They ſtuck in what the letter required of them, without beholding the perfect fulfillment both of the moral and ceremonial law in the great Meſſiah: Which leads us to conſider the <hi>ſpirit which giveth life;</hi> which is here alſo called the <hi>new-teſtament.</hi> This cannot mean meerly that part of the bible that is ſo called in diſtinction from the reſt; for the apoſtles made abundant uſe of the old-teſtament in their miniſtry, and drew evangelical inſtructions from all
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012316_0013_0F8A20542C6E2D10"/>parts of it; and they expreſly declare to us that thoſe ſcriptures were all given by divine inſpiration, for our learning and admonition, on whom the ends of the world are come, 1 Cor. 10.11. Rom. 15.4. 2 Tim. 3.16, 17. It is well known that the word teſtament means the ſame as a <hi>will,</hi> whereby a perſon orders his affairs, and diſpoſes of his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt as he thinks beſt; ſo here it plainly means what is called the new covenant, in diſtinction from the old. When the great Creator had formed the world and all that is therein, he was pleaſed to crown man with glory and honor, and ſet him over the works of his hands, and to make known to him his will, and the tenor on which he ſhould enjoy his eſtate and happineſs, even perfect obedience to his law and that tranſgreſſion ſhould ſtrip him of life, and all. Man ſinned and ruined himſelf and his poſterity: Therefore ſince the firſt Adam is thus fallen, all things are put into the hands of the ſecond Adam, who is the Lord from heaven; and who will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due all things unto himſelf, yea will ſwallow up death in victory. Pſa. 8.5, 6. 1 Cor. 15, 45—54. Heb. 2.7—9.</p>
            <p>Some notice of this great deliverer was given to our firſt parents ſoon after the fall, under the name of the ſeed of the woman who ſhould bruiſe the ſerpent's head. And he was further promiſed to Abraham, that in his feed all the families of the earth ſhould be bleſſed. This new-teſtament way of ſalvation is clearly opened in the goſpel, which diſcovers how Chriſt was made of a woman, of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham's ſeed, and by his obedience and ſufferings in our ſtead, has procured a perfect righteouſneſs
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012316_0014_0F8A20544EFD0D28"/>which is unto all and upon all them that believe; which therefore is here called, the <hi>miniſtration of righteouſneſs,</hi> ver. 9. In conſequence of which the holy Spirit is given to take away the vail from men's hearts, and give them with open face as in a glaſs to behold the glory of the Lord, whereby they are changed into his image. From all which it appears that, by the New-teſtament, and the ſpirit that giveth life, is intended the way of juſtification by Chriſt's righteouſneſs, and of regeneration and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by the power of the holy Ghoſt; which may well be ſaid to give life, as the one delivers from the law-ſentence of death, and the other from the power of corruption which is ſpiritual death, and enables the ſoul to live unto God. This leads us,</p>
            <p n="3">III. To conſider the effect of the goſpel miniſtry. The letter killeth, but the ſpirit giveth life. The letter kills when it comes with light and power up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the mind, by laying open the corruption and contrariety of the heart to God, and fixing the juſt ſentence of death in the conſcience whereby all the hopes they have built on the life of their own hands, give up the ghoſt. Thus our apoſtle ſays, "Sin revived and I <hi>died;</hi> but when the letter had killed him, the Spirit of God revealed his Son in him, and drew his ſoul to a marriage union to <hi>Him who is raiſed from the dead,</hi> that he might ſerve in <hi>new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit,</hi> and not in the <hi>oldneſs of the letter,</hi> Rom. 7.4,—10. But where the letter only is preached, it killeth, as it takes life and courage from men, becauſe the law requires what it gives no ſtrength to perform, and the ſoul ſinks in dejection and deſpair, or tries to quit the thoughts of theſe
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012316_0015_0F8A20550468C4D8"/>things for fear thereof; or elſe, ſuppoſing ſuch teaching to be right, people go on in a round of duties with a name to live while they are dead, and the blind lead the blind, until both fall into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death.</p>
            <p>From hence, my Brethren, we may learn, 1. The vaſt importance of the goſpel miniſtry. Nothing leſs than the affairs of life and death are concerned therein; not ſuch a tranſitory one as we have here; no, it is nothing leſs than the eternal life, or eternal death of precious ſouls. If miniſters are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabled to be faithful, they may be inſtrumental of the life of many; of ſaving themſelves, and thoſe that hear them, 1 Tim. 4.16. But if otherwiſe, they know not how much miſchief they may do; how many blind ſouls they may lead to deſtruction, nor how many righteous ones they may make ſad. O my fathers and brethren in the miniſtry, how ſhould theſe things rouſe us all up! How ſhould they move us all to ſearch our hearts and ways, and cauſe each one to exert himſelf in his ſtation, not counting his life dear unto himſelf, ſo that he might finiſh his courſe with joy, and the miniſtry he has received to teſtify the goſpel of the grace of God! And did chriſtians view theſe things as they ought, how careful would it make them concerning thoſe whom they received into the miniſtry? And alſo to pray for their miniſters more, and to truſt them leſs than many do. Who is ſufficient for theſe things? Surely none are of themſelves; and yet if perſons have received benefit by any inſtrument, how prone are they to expect the like again without looking to the great fountain of all good? Did
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012316_0016_0F8A2055C1992248"/>chriſtians more clearly view theſe things as they are, they would be engaged to commit their miniſters and themſelves too more earneſtly unto Him who is all in all to his people. The great apoſtle of the Gentiles, notwithſtanding all his giſts and attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſeemed as if he could not write one e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle without ſtirring up the ſaints to this duty, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <q>Brethren, pray for us; pray for us that the word of the Lord may have free courſe and be glorified; ſtriving together with me in your prayers,</q> &amp;c. And ſurely there is great encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement ſo to do, for when God appears in his glory to build up Zion, he will regard the prayer of the deſtitute, and not deſpiſe their prayer, Pſa. 102.17.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hence ſee the great importance of ever keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing law and goſpel in their diſtinct place, ſince one kills, and the other gives life. The law is good if we uſe it lawfully. It's proper uſe is to ſhew us what we ought to be, and in that light to convince us that we are not ſuch, for by the law is the <hi>knowledge of ſin;</hi> but if it is made uſe of to teach ſouls how to obtain the divine favor, or how to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain eternal life, it is then put out of it's proper place. Though we hear nany cry out, <q>what! muſt we teach ſinners no duty till they are converted?</q> yes, by all means; teach them their indiſpenſable obligation to keep the whole law, and that they are bound over to anſwer for every neglect of it, at the great tribunal.—This many conceit is too ſtrict, and often plead for an abatement of the law, like the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt ſteward, who for a hundred would write fifty or four ſcore. But what is this abatement? Is it
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012316_0017_0F8A205677A383D8"/>like Ezekiel's hearers, to come before God <hi>as his people,</hi> and with their <hi>mouth</hi> to ſhew <hi>much love,</hi> while their <hi>heart</hi> goeth after their coveteouſneſs? The ſum of the law is to love God with all our hearts, and our neighbours as ourſelves; and Jeſus ſaid, <hi>This do and thou ſhalt live.</hi> But the lawyer, willing to juſtify himſelf, left God out of the queſtion and ſaid, <hi>Who is my neighbour?</hi> This is a notable abatement indeed! In trying rebels, for the judge to leave the King out of the queſtion, and only try how they had behaved to each other! Yet how poorly does he make out even in this way? For by the inſtance of a man that fell among thieves, our Lord ſhews that a <hi>Samaritan</hi> (with whom they would have no dealings) diſcovered ſuch <hi>love</hi> to a proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>compaſſion,</hi> as both their Prieſt and Levite did not, Luk. 10.29—37. So have I known ſome who would quote that ſummary of the divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirement in Mica. 6.8. and evidently riſe no higher in their notion of doing <hi>juſtly,</hi> than juſt dealing towards men; as if robbing God of his juſt due, which is all the heart, all the ſoul, ſtrength and mind, did not demand ſatisfaction! Yea, and how often is it now found, that many who profeſs to walk humbly with God in the forms of religion, yet pay little regard to anſwering their <hi>juſt</hi> engagements to men, or to ſhew <hi>mercy</hi> to thoſe who ſtand in need?</p>
            <p>If we come to a review of this text, we may ſee that the Lord had commenced an action againſt Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael for their ingratitude and diſobedience, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the mountains and hills to be judges of their ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid conduct. They ſoon ſaw they could not ſtand
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012316_0018_0F8A205731F26850"/>the trial, and enquired how they ſhould make up the matter; whether he would not be <hi>pleaſed</hi> if they brought large offerings, or a multitude of them? And if irrational victims would not do, whether hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ones would not pleaſe him? And they talk of offering the fruit of their body for the ſin of their ſoul. The anſwer is, he hath <hi>ſhewed</hi> thee O man what is good, and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do <hi>juſtly?</hi> &amp;c. He had <hi>ſhewed</hi> them in the foregoing chapter, that out of Bethlehem HE ſhould come forth that is to be ruler in Iſrael, whoſe <hi>goings forth</hi> have been <hi>from everlaſting;</hi> and that, <hi>this man ſhall be the peace.</hi> God requires no more than his juſt due, and this God-man, and he only can pay it. He only has opened a way for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſ eſs and peace to kifs each other in the ſinner's ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Some imagine that by letter, the literal meaning of ſcripture is intended; and by ſpirit ſome myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal meaning that is hid under it; and from hence they call the word, a dead lever; but how greatly do ſuch unſtake the text? The letter <hi>killeth,</hi> and certainly that which actively kills others can't be a dead thing itſelf. The goſpel is as plainly written as the law, and our Lord's conſtant method of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling ſatan was by what is <hi>written;</hi> and when the tempter tried to enſnare him in the ſame way, he did not depart from it to myſtical meanings, but produced another text which detected his perverſion of that. A great variety of improvements may be made of all parts of ſcripture, while one conſiſtent meaning runs through the whole; and thoſe who venture to depart from that, know not what delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions they may run into.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:012316_0019_0F8A20590D081328"/>
We always need the ſpirit to enlighten our minds to underſtand the ſcriptures, but the rule is the ſame in the dark as in the light, and is the ſame in itſelf before we underſtand its uſe, as when we are beſt ſkilled therein; though without the light we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee it, and without being taught we cannot uſe it aright; what the Spirit does, is to give us light, ſkill and ſtrength to uſe it as we ought. I know it is pleaded, that the ſcriptures know nothing of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons and caſes now, and that this want muſt be ſupplied by the Spirit, which therefore they would have to be a rule ſuperior to the word. To which I reply, that the beſt laws of any ſtate know nothing of the names and particular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of thouſands that are under them; yet when thoſe laws are well underſtood, and duly applied, they ſerve well to ſettle the various caſes that occur; or if in ſome caſes they fail, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe human laws are imperfect; but the divine laws are not ſo; they are <hi>perfect,</hi> and therefore are ſufficient <hi>thoroughly to furniſh the man of God unto all good works.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16, 17. And the meek he will guide in judgment, and the meek he will teach his way; but to pretend that we have a rule within us that leads us in any reſpect contrary to God's written word, diſcovers a temper as contrary to true meekneſs, as it would do for a judge to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume a power to diſpenſe with the king's laws, or to make new ones as the turn ſuited.</p>
            <p>Thoſe holy men that God employed to publiſh the New-teſtament as well as the old, he gave de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration to the world of their divine authority ſo to do, and <hi>confirmed the word with ſigns follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:012316_0020_0F8A20598E33B630"/>Mar. 16.20. How great then muſt be their deluſion, if any imagine that the divine Spirit in them will teach them to judge or act contrary to what he formerly moved holy men to write! Yet are there not ſome even in this concourſe of people (for I mean to ſpeak plainly) that profeſs to be ſo ſpiritual as not externally to regard ſome of the plain commands of Chriſt, who at the ſame time depend not on a righteouſneſs wrought without them, but on what is wrought within them? But if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon any inward frames or exerciſes as the matter of our juſtification and acceptance with God, we as really build upon the letter as any formaliſt in the world; all the difference lies in the mode of doing; for the letter is <hi>do and live,</hi> and the doing it requires is <hi>love</hi> to God and man, and a behavior agreable thereto, and who does not know that <hi>love</hi> has it's ſeat within? So that inward doings are as plainly the letter as any thing that is outward, and to depend upon either of them is directly contrary to <hi>believing on Him that juſtifieth the ungodly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The law requires a right temper and behavior, and ſays, <hi>I will if they will,</hi> but gives no ſuch thing; the goſpel reveals Chriſt's righteouſneſs, and gives the Spirit to write the law in our hearts with this tenor, <hi>I will and they ſhall,</hi> Gal. 3.10— 14. Heb. 8.10. In the oldneſs of the letter the promiſe is always predicated upon ſomething good in the creature; but the newneſs of the Spirit reſts the promiſe intirely upon the merits of the Savior, and the truth of the promiſer; and hence ariſes that important diſtinction, which the apoſtle inſiſts ſo much upon, between <hi>debt</hi> and <hi>grace, wages</hi> and
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:012316_0021_0F8A205A4A669CE8"/>
               <hi>gift,</hi> Rom. 4.4, 5, 19. and 6.23. Heb. 11.11. And here I would obſerve, that many greatly miſtake themſelves about holding to ſalvation by grace. Becauſe the bleſſings they hope to receive are of infinitely greater value than their doings, therefore they ſuppoſe they hold to grace and not debt. But could Adam it he had ſtood, or can any angel in heaven now, ſuppoſe that there is any thing like an equal value between their beſt obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and moſt devout ſervice, and eternal life? Surely no. Well then, according to this notion, all the favors beſtowed by the Creator on men or angels, is all not debt but grace, and the apoſtles long talk of a diſtinction between them was all either impertinence or impoſition! But if men would duly conſider, they may know, that by the laws of men, where there is a fair promiſe made of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſum upon a certain condition, if the condition is fulfilled, the law will oblige the promiſer to pay the ſum, let it be ever ſo much greater than the value of the condition that is performed. Debt is to <hi>pay</hi> what is engaged; and do not all know that a <hi>gift</hi> to the needy and miſerable is quite another thing? And if any ſhould come to beg for help, and yet ſhould ſo forget themſelves as to dictate to others how much to give, and alſo claim it as their right, inſtead of humbly aſking for it as a free fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; would not men ſoon diſcern the difference? How much more will not the ſearcher of hearts do it?</p>
            <p>Perhaps men blind themſelves in our day con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this matter, as much under the word faith, as in any way whatever. When the word is uſed
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:012316_0022_0F8A205BFB2B5AA8"/>about human affairs, it is as eaſily underſtood as other words, but in religion ſcarce any are more contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; and what can be the cauſe of it but it's being turned from it's proper meaning?</p>
            <p>Aſſent to a report that comes with proper evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of its truth, is the plain nature of faith, the influence the report has upon us is the effect or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of faith; but it is ſuppoſed by multitudes, that devils and hypocrites affent to the ſame truths the ſaint does, and therefore that ſomething more belongs to the nature of the ſaint's faith than aſſent to truth; but I humbly conceive that this is a great miſtake. The devils, and ſometimes wicked men, believe that there is one God that will puniſh ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſo as to make them tremble; yet there are two parts of truth on which our ſalvation turns that they never have aſſented to: One is, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning ſentence againſt them is juſt; the other is, that God can find in his heart to ſave thoſe who have nothing of their own but ſin. The evidence of theſe truths ſhine as clear in the ſcriptures, as the ſun does in the firmament; but we have our Lord's own teſtimony that, <hi>Every one that doth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, leſt his deeds ſhould be reproved:</hi> And <hi>this is their condemnation,</hi> John 3.19, 20. Yet we have many maſters ſince Nicodemus's day who will dare to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny what our Lord here aſſerts. They allow it to be ſo with many, but not with <hi>every one;</hi> the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural conſequence of which is, for them to ſuppoſe it unjuſt, for thoſe who have ſome good ideas and diſpoſitions, not to have a better claim to ſalvation than others; and from hence proceed the exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:012316_0023_0F8A205C83531EB8"/>we often hear, againſt the doctrine of ſovereign grace, as making God unjuſt, a reſpecter of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, &amp;c. Whereas if it were truly believed that we are every one condemned by a righteous ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, there could be no room to complain of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice if all were executed, nor to doubt of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intirely of grace if any were pardoned. And how abſurd is it to imagine that God will pardon any one ſoul till it comes to own his juſtice? For without that they can never be truly reconciled to his government, nor he honored in their ſalvation. And if ſo, then how abſurd are all thoſe notions (of which our world is full) that ſinners in general be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the goſpel to be true, but that they have a great deal to do in order to get its bleſſings applied to them! For all doings <hi>before</hi> reconciliation are a putting off for the preſent, and if they believed they were juſtly condemned, how could they bear with delay leſt the door ſhould be ſhut againſt them forever. And if they believed that God ſpeaks the truth when he proclaims pardon to the <hi>chief of ſinners, what duties could they do before they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his teſtimony, and ſet to their ſeal that he is true?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If a man that is under ſentence of death ſhould ſlip from his confinement, and do ever ſo much in hopes of being again received as a good ſubject, don't all men know that his doings can never be true <hi>obedience</hi> to the authority that condemned him, till that authority either reverſes the ſentence, or grants him a pardon? And now let us ſee what ſort of faith thoſe people have, who are not ready to come to Chriſt now, yet ſay they are <hi>ſtriving</hi> for
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:012316_0024_0F8A206146790738"/>if, and hope to obtain it hereafter. Why indeed they believe there is a dangerous ſentence out againſt them, and they fear they ſhould ſtand a poor chance to come as they are, but they hope by and by to get ready for a re-hearing, and hope then to make it appear that the Judge was miſtaken in his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and that though they had been drawn into ſome very diſagreable things, yet that they are now ſo well diſpoſed, that they <hi>ought</hi> to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to <hi>mercy!</hi> Theſe are notable notions of faith, of juſtice, and of grace! O ſinner, be not deceived! All ſuch attempts will ſucceed no better than the wife of Jereboam did, in <hi>feigning</hi> herſelf to be <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> perſon, 1 Kings 14.5—14.</p>
            <p>Thus I think it plainly appears that no unrenew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſoul truly believes that God is either juſt or gracious, nor ever will by all the power of moral ſuaſion; nothing can produce this faith but that <hi>creating</hi> power that in the beginning ſaid, "Let there be <hi>light,</hi> and there was <hi>light:</hi>" Firſt, the light of the law which <hi>kills</hi> all the ſinner's vain hopes; and then the light of the goſpel, which opens the true door of hope through Him who has fulfilled the law. Our natural attachment to our doings, the apoſtle compares to a woman's being wedded to an huſband, whoſe authority is <hi>binding</hi> upon her as long as they both live; and he obſerves that it would be <hi>adultery</hi> for her to marry another before her firſt huſband was dead; from whence he ſhews that we cannot be married to Chriſt until the law is dead to us, and we to that; and in explaining his meaning he is very careful to ſecure the honor of the law, that it is <hi>holy, juſt</hi> and <hi>good;</hi> but when a
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:012316_0025_0F8A20616449B7F8"/>ſurety has fully anſwered for a debt or crime, that action is <hi>dead</hi> to the debtor or criminal, ſo that a juſt law cannot hurt him for it, any more than the dead can hurt the living; hence this death or diſſolution of the marriage tie between us and the law, is by the <hi>body of Chriſt.</hi> His bearing our <hi>ſins in his own body on the tree,</hi> took away the power of the law to condemn us, and a view of our ſins, and of him who atoned for them, turns the heart from ſin and from ſeeking life by our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to truſt in and unite our hearts with <hi>Him who is raiſed from the dead, that we ſhould bring forth fruit unto God:</hi> Our life is ſtill to be directed by the ſame law of love to God and man, only it is changed into other hands, we are <hi>under law to Chriſt</hi> our new huſband. And it is well known that when a woman is married the law muſt come upon her huſband for all her debts, and that ſhe is to look to him for all ſhe wants, and to be under his government: So here we are to ſerve him in <hi>newneſs of ſpirit,</hi> and not in the <hi>oldneſs of the letter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The oldneſs of the letter promiſes life upon do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but gives no ſtrength to do; the newneſs of the ſpirit ſays, as thy days is thy ſtrength ſhall be; come boldly to the throne of grace for help in time of need. The oldneſs of the letter gives no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to come only upon our doing, and ſets a flaming ſword in the way of the guilty; but the newneſs of the ſpirit directs us to take all our encouragement to come, from the merits, compaſſion, interceſſion and promiſe of our huſband, who has engaged <hi>justice</hi> and <hi>faithfulneſs</hi> to <hi>forgive</hi> the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:012316_0026_0F8A2061B253D9A0"/>and to <hi>cleanſe</hi> the filthy. Heb. 4.14—16. 1. John. 1.9. The oldneſs of the letter ſuſpends our hope <hi>doubtfully</hi> upon our obedience; the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſpirit fixes it as an anchor <hi>ſure and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast</hi> upon what is within the vail. Heb. 6.19. Upon the whole, that teaching which enjoins duty upon us as the condition of our obtaining favor of God, be that duty called repentance, faith, or whatever it may, is legality; that which would abate the law to bring it down to our ability is injuſtice; that which tends to releaſe us from our obligation, till al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty grace appears for our deliverance, is licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs; but that teaching which opens the holy nature and authority of God's law over us, ſhewing how we are all condemned thereby, and then the help there is freely proclaimed to every one in Jeſus Chriſt, and the fullneſs there is in him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the believer to perfect holineſs in the fear of God, is evangelical; therefore let each ſoul take heed what he hears.</p>
            <p>The copiouſneſs of this ſubject has carried me ſo far, that I muſt haſten to a cloſe with a ſhort Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs.</p>
            <p>Firſt, To you, my Brother, who art this day to take the ſolemn Charge of this flock. The ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction we have gained of your being qualified in a good meaſure, and called of God into this work, gives ſenſible pleaſure, and I can heartily bid you welcome into theſe labours of Chriſt's vineyard, and hope we may be mutual helpers to each other. I doubt not but the charge of ſouls has ſometimes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to you an inſupportable weight; it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:012316_0027_0F8A20646D27D850"/>too heavy for men or angels to go through of themſelves; but ever remember, that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Zion is upon Chriſt's ſhoulders, and you are to be ſtrong in the grace that is in him. I have endeavoured, as I have been enabled, plainly to lay before you the true nature of preaching the goſpel, and may you be enabled to be faithful therein unto the death, and receive a crown of life through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord!</p>
            <p>Secondly, To this dear Church of Chriſt. Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, we rejoice with you this day, to ſee things ſo comfortably ſettled among you after your ſore trials, and that you are like to enjoy the ſtated miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the divine word and ordinances again: Theſe are favors greatly to be prized and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be improved; though I hope you will never forget the ſenſible experience you have had of the uncertainty of their continuance; and ſo that you ought always to live with an intire depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on the great Head of the church, both for the continuance of theſe means, and alſo for a bleſſing on the uſe of them.</p>
            <p>And permit me my Brethren to lay before both officers and members, three points of truth, which I earneſtly requeſt you to keep always in mind; which are,
<list>
                  <item>1. That a viſible church-ſtate with it's order and government, is not an invention of men, but the appointment of God. Therefore,</item>
                  <item>2. That thoſe who rightly join therein, join themſelves <hi>to Him,</hi> who is both able and faithful to carry them through all that he calls them to do or ſuffer in his cauſe. Hence,</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="30" facs="unknown:012316_0028_0F8A20654438FE60"/>
3. There can never be any juſt excuſe for one ſoul to deſert this cauſe while HE remain what HE is.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are ſuch ſelf-evident truths that it might ſeem an affront to your underſtandings to ſtand long to prove them, yet through our darkneſs they are ſo often forgotten, and that forgetfulneſs is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of ſo many miſchiefs, that I preſume you will not deem it unſeaſonable thus to ſtir up your pure minds by way of remembrance. A due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to theſe points would prevent what has often happened, of perſons joining with a church in its proſperity, and deſerting it in adverſity, being ſond of comfort, but backward to do their duty. And a juſt view of theſe truths would prevent perſons joining to the church when they do not to the Lord. We read when Ananias and his wife were ſtruck dead for their deceit, that of the reſt durſt no man join himſelf <hi>to them;</hi> but believers were <hi>the more added to the Lord,</hi> Acts 5.13, 14. Viewing things in this light would keep people from truſting their religion to their miniſter, without ſeeing with their own eyes, on the one hand; or on the other, riſing in reſentment againſt them becauſe they will not do for gods. Paul ſays, we have this treaſure in <hi>earthen veſſels,</hi> that the excellency of the power may be <hi>of God,</hi> and <hi>not of us;</hi> and who was ever ſo ſtupid as to think a veſſel could ſeed them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out new ſupplies, or to quarrel with it becauſe they found it empty; would they not rather carry it to the ſtore that it might be filled again? Well, my Brethren, if you will do ſo with your miniſters, it will learn you the true difference, between having
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:012316_0029_0F8A206714C78CB0"/>a man's <hi>perſon</hi> in admiration becauſe of advantage, and eſteeming him highly in love for his <hi>works ſake.</hi> Again, if we are truly joined to the Lord, we have a friend at hand to open our griefs to, and to roll our burdens upon, which may keep us from the error of many, who being burdened with their brother, whiſper it to this, that and the other, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of acting according to divine rule with him. Prov. 25.9. Matt. 18.15—17. If we viewed Him who walks in the midſt of his churches, with eyes like a flame of fire, how would it keep us from complaining of our brethren, without being faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to them? Since he has given clear direction therein, how churches are to be faithful to their members, and members to churches, that have ſtrayed, ſo as either to recover them, or to clear our ſelves of them, if they will not be reformed. In ſhort, when theſe truths are duly remembred they will make miniſters faithful to their people, and people faithful to their miniſters, for their obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations are mutual; and the right performance of every duty toward each other, is ſerving the Lord Chriſt; and when miniſters view how they owe their all to Him, how gladly will they ſpend and be ſpent in his cauſe? And the ſame view will make people as glad to diſcharge their duty towards their miniſters, and towards each other. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let us hold faſt the profeſſion of our faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wavering (for he is faithful that promiſed) and let us conſider one another to provoke unto love, and to good works; not forſaking the aſſembling of ourſelves together, as the manner of ſome is; but exhorting one another, and ſo much the more, as ye ſee the day approaching!</p>
