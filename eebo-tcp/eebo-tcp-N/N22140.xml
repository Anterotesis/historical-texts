            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>CONSTITUTION OF THE <hi>HUMANE SOCIETY</hi> OF THE STATE OF NEW-YORK.</head>
            <p>With a view of promoting the intereſts of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, a number of reſpectable Citizens have aſſociated under the name of "<hi>THE HUMANE SOCIETY OF THE STATE OF NEW-YORK,</hi> and have agreed to the following <hi>Conſtitution</hi>:— which is now ſubmitted to the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Fellow-Citizens. Experience in ſome of our ſiſter States, as well as in in Europe, has evinced, that ſimilar inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have been attended with the moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py effects. It cannot be doubted, but the ſame generous and laudable ſpirit which has been ſo often exerted by the inhabitants of this State, will be diſplayed, in ſupporting an Inſtitution, which can have no other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in view than benevolence to mankind.</p>

            <head>ADDRESS TO THE CITIZENS.
Fellow Citizens of the City and State of New-York.</head>
            <p>THE numerous ſudden deaths, from various cauſes, of which every year furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es examples, ſhould excite the attention of every humane and well regulated communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The value of life muſt be felt among all nations; even among thoſe who make the deſtruction of it their ſtudy and occupation. But in a country, where, from the happy organization of its government, the worth of man is duly appreciated, and where agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture and commerce form his chief buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, life obtains a higher eſtimation, and aſſumes a more diſtinguiſhed importance. It were, ſuperfluous, therefore, on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to expatiate on the propriety of any inſtitution which has for its object the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and continuance of exiſtence: Equally ſuperfluous would it be, to appeal
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:029202_0010_0FDFCA2DC8322118"/>to Europe, for precedents to eſtabliſh the propriety of an undertaking like that in which we have engaged.—That in many caſes of <hi>apparent</hi> death, life has afterwards been diſcovered to be preſent;—that, by the application of proper means, thouſands have been reſcued from the ſtate of appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent death, and reſtored to the wiſhes and embraces of their families and friends;— that ſome regular plan is beſt fitted to effect this deſirable reſtoration,—and that Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations of the nature of the preſent inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are moſt effectual for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that purpoſe;—are facts which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of no diſpute; and which, had no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or eſtabliſhment of the like nature ever been formed, are ſufficient to juſtify, and render important in the view of all men our preſent undertaking.</p>
            <p>In a City like this, and in a State ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive, and ſo expoſed to all thoſe accidents which actually occaſion ſudden <hi>apparent death</hi>; it is a matter of ſerious regret, that ſo little of this kind has hitherto been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted; and that this little has produced no effect, as far as has come to our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Indeed the only proviſion made for the reſtoration of perſons from a ſtate of apparent death, appears to us not only wholly inadequate, but for the moſt part,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:029202_0011_0FDFCA6EC3E2B488"/>abſolutely pernicious. And hence we are the more ſtrongly incited to purſue our deſign; ſince it is evident that while the expectations of the Citizens are placed on that which can ſerve no good end, the hope of any benefit from attempts at reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, thus conducted, muſt be deluſory and vain.—To afford ſome more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hope, ſomething on which the Public may rely with greater aſſurance of effect and advantage, we offer the following di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, as the reſult of our moſt diligent enquiry into the ſubject; giving notice at the ſame time, that the objects of our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation will never be loſt ſight of,—and that we ſhall continue to publiſh from time to time, ſuch additional information, both on the ſubject of reſuſcitation and on other matters, connected with the public health, as may reſult from a more enlarged ſphere of obſervation, from more extenſive per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal experience, and from the labours of the learned in various parts of the world.</p>

            <p>Sudden apparent death <hi>may ariſe from</hi> drowning, hanging, drinking cold liquors, and eating ices in warm weather, the vapours of wells, cellars, fermenting liquors, and from the fumes of burning charcoal, and various metallic ſubſtances; from lightning; from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure to exceſſive heat or cold; from confined rooms, and various other cauſes.</p>

               <p n="9">9. In <hi>all</hi> caſes, <hi>one of the principal objects ſhould be to reſtore a healthful degree of heat to the body, without which animal motion or life cannot be renewed.</hi> This is to be done by <hi>perſeverance</hi> in the foregoing directions, and particularly by applying warm cloths to the body, which ſhould be moiſtened with <hi>hot ſpirits,</hi> and by rubbing the body with them, and by applying hot bricks made wet with <hi>vinegar</hi> to the ſoles of the <hi>feet. If poſſible, two vigorous and healthful perſons ſhould be perſuaded to ſtrip themſelves naked and lie on each ſide of the body, embracing it cloſely and imparting their animal heat to the patient.</hi> But a warming-pan with burning coals, ſhould never be uſed, on account of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate heat and the fumes of the coals.</p>

               </head>
               <p>To prevent the bad effects of Cold Liquors.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It will be beſt never to drink while very hot: or,</p>
               <p n="2">2. To drink a little at a time, holding it in the mouth ſome moments before ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing: or,</p>

                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:029202_0021_0FDFCA7C5A211A28"/>3. To hold the veſſel ſome moments with both hands, till the liquor may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be tempered: or,</p>
               <p n="4">4. To waſh the hands and face, and rinſe the mouth and throat before drinking; and then to drink moderately, and often repeat it.</p>
               <p>The eating of ices having become a faſhionable luxury in hot weather, it is the more neceſſary to mention the bad effects of this practice: In general, they are apt to produce <hi>cholic, cholera morbus, and dyſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi> or ſome other <hi>diſeaſe</hi> of the <hi>ſtomach and bowels</hi>; and frequently in <hi>women,</hi> eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe of a <hi>delicate habit,</hi> this practice produces a <hi>ſuppreſſion of the menſes,</hi> and an <hi>enſuing loſs of health.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In many caſes the taking of ices will be highly <hi>ſalutary.</hi> In ſome diſeaſes they may be uſed with great advantage, as in <hi>burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or inflammatory fevers,</hi> and for <hi>local applications</hi> in certain other diſeaſes; but they never can be ſwallowed with ſafety, unleſs the following cautions be attended to: viz.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hold the veſſel in the hands of few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before taking the ice into the mouth.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="22" facs="unknown:029202_0022_0FDFCA40D0D6F960"/>2. Let the ice, particularly ice Creams, be completely diſſolved in the mouth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be ſwallowed. This many are apt to neglect, on account of its producing pain in the teeth; but if the ice ſhould be conveyed into the ſtomach, it will produce a much more ſerious evil than the tooth-ach.</p>
               <p n="3">3. All perſons in health, who regale themſelves with the eating of ices, as a mere delicacy in the warm ſeaſon; immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after taking them, ſhould ſwallow a glaſs of wine, or ſome ſpirituous drink.</p>
               <p>To remove the bad effects when they have taken place.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Immediately cauſe the patient to drink a glaſs of ſome ſpirituous liquor.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If laudanum can be had, let him take from 10 to 100 drops, according to his age, habits, and the violence of the pain. N. B. People habituated to the uſe of ardent ſpirits, require much larger doſes of laudanum than others; but in all caſes it will be ſafeſt to uſe other ſtimulants, on account of the bad effects of large doſes of opiate medicines.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let the patient be removed to a

               <p n="4">4. Continue theſe means ſome time, and rub the body with warm flannels; oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally adminiſtering warm ſpirituous drinks.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If the perſon be apparently dead, proceed as in the caſe of drowning.</p>

<pb n="31" facs="unknown:029202_0031_0FDFCA8769F2E058"/>avoided at firſt, and afterwards <hi>introduced gradually</hi> as in the article of drowning.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. The patient, during all this time, and for many hours after, ſhould be kept in a room without any fire; a briſk purge ſhould be adminiſtered; after the operation of which, the frozen part, having been continued for a proper length of time in the water, ſhould be anointed with a little oil, and the part being wrapped up properly, the patient ſhould go to bed.</p>
                  <p>All ſpirituous drinks ſhould be avoided, and the patient ſhould be very abſtemious in his diet, to moderate the ſubſequent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation or mortification.</p>

<hi>Of Intoxication, or Drunkenneſs.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>The ſymptoms are too well known to need any deſcription.</p>
               <p>The treatment muſt be varied according to different conſtitutions and circumſtances; and in caſe of ſudden apparent death, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going rules muſt be obſerved. In general, it may be recommended to lay the body in an eaſy poſture, and in a cool place, with the head a little raiſed; to looſe all tight things about the body and limbs, particularly the neck; to ſuffer the patient to ſleep, to make him ſmell the fumes of ſtrong vinegar, and to rub the body gently with vinegar and water. After the debauch is over, the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els ſhould be moderately purged, or opened with a <hi>clyſter,</hi> unleſs the ſtrong liquors have done this before; or produced <hi>vomiting,</hi> which ſhould never be much urged with <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines.</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="unknown:029202_0035_0FDFCA8F3209E020"/>Let him drink freely of cool water at the time of intoxication, and ſwallow a few ſpoonfuls of olive oil, or ſome other mild oil; but afterwards, when he begins to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer debility and ſickneſs at his ſtomach, let the ſtimulus of ardent ſpirits be changed for ſomething more durable, ſuch as good ſoup, well ſeaſoned with ſalt and pepper, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally uſing ſome cordial drink, which the effect of habit in thoſe who have made too free a uſe of ſtrong liquors, will often abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely require; exerciſe, and even labour in proportion to the ſtrength of the patient, ſhould alſo be enjoined.</p>
               <p>There are but few who have reſolution enough to conquer a tipling habit; but this number would be greater if they knew how to proceed; for their benefit the following advice is offered.</p>
               <p>The only effectual method to get rid of habitual intoxication is, to <hi>diminiſh the quantity of ſtrong liquor daily and gradually, which, with inflexible reſolution,</hi> will deſtroy the habit; or to <hi>change the ſtimulus of ſtrong liquors for ſomething more durable, and which is not endued with any ſtupifying property</hi>: For this purpoſe, proper food ſhould be taken, and an <hi>electuary</hi> compoſed of the
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:029202_0036_0FDFCA549E1E4808"/>
                  <hi>powder of Peruvian bark, wild valerean, or Columbo root,</hi> with the <hi>oil of Cloves,</hi> or ſome other <hi>eſſential oil,</hi> has, in many caſes, been found very uſeful; <hi>a piece as large as a nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meg,</hi> ſhould be taken ſeveral times in the day, <hi>eſpecially when a ſinking faintneſs is felt at the ſtomach.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All who have ſtudied the nature and properties of the ſtomach, know that the tone of that organ is deſtroyed by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive uſe of ſtrong liquors; the liquor of the ſtomach becomes vitiated and ſour, and the food is conſequently not properly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted and converted into good nouriſhment, ſo that the whole body ſoon becomes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured.</p>
               <p>In this ſituation, one of the beſt things that can be done, is to abſtain entirely from from all ſpirituous liquors; ſuch as rum, gin, brandy, whiſkey, Roman and hot purl, mint juleps, and all other mixtures of ſpirituous drinks, many of which are rendered ſtill more pernicious by being mixed with metalic and other poiſonous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
               <p>To relieve the patient from ſome of theſe evils, the <hi>newly expreſſed juice of lemons or limes</hi> has been found very ſerviceable; but
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:029202_0037_0FDFCA9109BFF4D8"/>what is much better, let him take from twenty to one hundred drops of the <hi>ſpirit of hartſhorn,</hi> in a ſmall cup of water, ſeveral times in the day; this will tend to deſtroy the morbid acid in the ſtomach, and to keep out the wind, as dram-drinkers expreſs it, much more effectually than drams them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and by being a ſubſtitute for the ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus of the ſtupifying liquors, it will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent languor, faintneſs and that dejection of mind, which too frequently drive the reſtleſs victim to the deluſive relief of the bowl and the glaſs.</p>
               <p>Temperance in eating ſhould alſo be ſtrictly obſerved, the want of which is often, productive of as bad, or even worſe effects than intemperance in drinking.</p>
               <p>Perſons who fall ſacrifices to theſe habits generally imagine that they are troubled with <hi>bilious diſorders</hi>; and of their own choice, or by the fooliſh advice of others, as ignorant as themſelves, they fly, for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little uneaſineſs ariſing from the derange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the digeſtive organs, to the uſe of <hi>emetics,</hi> by which they are but too often hurried out of exiſtence, eſpecially when this is accompanied with a <hi>liberal uſe of the lancet.</hi>

               <p>Theſe ſometimes produce the common appearances of death, while the patient is in a recoverable condition.

            <p>By the 14th article of the Conſtitution, any perſon, either an American Citizen, or Foreigner, without the formality of bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loting, may become a member, on paying to the Treaſurer the annual ſubſcription, and his name will be enrolled in the liſt of Contributors.</p>
            <p>Thoſe benevolent Citizens who are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to promote the uſeful purpoſes of this Infant Society, are requeſted to call on the Secretary or Treaſurer, and make themſelves members of an Inſtitution which may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly afford the ſucceſsful means of ſaving
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:029202_0041_0FDFCA5ADB570600"/>their own lives, or the lives of ſome of their deareſt friends.</p>
            <p>By the 5th article of the Conſtitution, the Truſtees are to take charge of the funds of the Society. Thoſe perſons whoſe ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on does not admit of their becoming active agents in the affairs of the Society, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that they have an opportunity for a uſeful exerciſe of their generoſity, by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing donations to the Society; which will be received by any of the Officers, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully appropriated to accompliſh the deſigns mentioned in the Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>It is probable that the Society will deem it expedient and uſeful, ſome time in the enſuing year, to offer a <hi>premium</hi> on a prize queſtion, to be given out for the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diſcuſſion of perſons of genius and learning, in all places.</p>
