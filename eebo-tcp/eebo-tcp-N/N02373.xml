            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The latter part of this <hi>Pſalm</hi> opens to us, with a Divine Eloquence, the Glory &amp; Majeſty of the GOD of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in that Series of Wonders; <hi>Iſrael'</hi>s Redemption out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> Verſe 15th, <hi>Thou haſt with thine Arm redeemed thy People—:</hi> And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes with the Excellency of their Government, and Leaders, <hi>Thou leddeſt thy People,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

In the Words obſerve the following things,</p>
            <p n="1">1. GOD <hi>Himſelf</hi> was <hi>Iſrael'</hi>s Leader: <hi>Thou leddeſt thy People</hi> Their Civil Conſtitution (as well as Eccleſiaſtical) was Extraordinary: There was a more immediate Interpoſition of GOD himſelf; in their Laws &amp; Adminiſtration: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore uſually denominated a <hi>Theocraſy.</hi> GOD by Himſelf broke the Iron Yoke; Formed their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment for them, Executed &amp; Adminiſtred it when Formed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Manner</hi> of the Adminiſtration: <hi>Thy People, as a Flock. GOD the Shepherd; Iſrael</hi> his <hi>Flock:</hi> This carrys an happy mixture of Tenderneſs &amp; Authority; Power &amp; Care; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection &amp; Diſcipline: Acted by the neareſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, ſpecial Propriety, and deareſt Affection.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>illuſtrious Inſtruments</hi> uſed by Him; <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; <hi>Aaron.</hi> Tho' their Government was a <hi>Theocraſy:</hi> it did not exclude Inſtruments: But then the Inſtruments firſt employed in this ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Government were agreable to it: Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and very Excellent Ones: Extraordinarily Called, Furniſhed Aſſiſted &amp; Supported by GOD. <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; <hi>Aaron</hi> were the Two firſt Inſtruments uſed by GOD: the renowned Heads of the Two Orders, Civil &amp; Religious. GOD raiſed them, furniſhed them, veſted them with Power; and by his ſpecial, conſtant Preſence with them, made them both, but <hi>Moſes</hi> more remarkably, the moſt ſignal Bleſſings to their People, and Examples to all future Rulers.</p>
            <p>How properly ſoever my Text would lead to it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as one ſpecial Branch of GOD's Government, to conſider <hi>Iſrael'</hi>s Conſtitution, and Rulers in
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002816_0006_0FE64FB289D00A08"/>
Church, as well as State, I paſs it; and ſhall be govern'd by the occaſion; and confine my ſelf to the Civil Conſtitution &amp; Rulers, as a fruit of GOD's merciful Government, and give you a few tho'ts upon the Bleſſing of <hi>that,</hi> when wiſely and juſtly managed. I will give you my Subject in the following</p>
            <p>
               <label>DOCTRINE.</label>
               <hi>IT is to be Notic'd &amp; Celebrated, as an high Favour of GOD to his People; when He leads them like a Flock, by the hand of</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Aaron; <hi>or Wiſe &amp; Good Civil Rulers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed the principal Bleſſing of GOD, and a People's moſt vital &amp; fundamental Diſtinction, Honour &amp; Happineſs conſiſts in their Excellent Conſtitution of church-Government formed upon the revealed Plan, the holy Scriptures; and wiſe &amp; faithful Guides to adminiſter it: Churches formed by CHRIST himſelf, with an exact agreableneſs to his own moſt wiſe &amp; perfect Rules, filled with Ordinances, and all Inſtituted Officers; and very particularly a learned and faithful Mininiſtry: Theſe are a People's Glory and Safety, (<hi>Pſal</hi> 147 20.) what they ſhould eſpecially value, be thankful for, be concern'd to ſecure &amp; improve. But the Occaſion leads me to the Civil; and that too is a very illuſtrious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of GOD.

            <p>PROP. <hi>I. GOD is, in an appropriate manner, the</hi> Leader <hi>of a Profeſſing People.</hi> He was <hi>Iſrael'</hi>s Leader; and he is the leader of every profeſſing People. Every profeſſing People is his peculiar People; and he leads them as ſuch. Indeed they are not led by the ſame extraordinary, miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, immediate hand of GOD, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> was in their Redemption from <hi>Egypt,</hi> Conduct thro' the Wilderneſs, and their being put into Poſſeſſion of <hi>Canaan.</hi> This is Celebrated, &amp; Confined to to them: Deut. 4. 32, 33, 34. <hi>Ask now of the Days, that are paſt, from the Day that God created Man upon the earth</hi>—<hi>Did ever People hear God ſpeaking out of the midſt of Fire? Or hath God eſſayed to take him a nation out of the midſt of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by temptations, by ſigns, by wonders, and by a mighty hand,</hi> &amp;c. But yet in every other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing People, there's the ſame Relation of GOD to them, as to <hi>Iſrael;</hi> the ſame Grounds &amp; Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Acting towards &amp; for them: and they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs themſelves in the ſame happy Fruits; tho' working after a diverſe manner, <hi>viz.</hi> By <hi>ſecond</hi> Cauſes. But here I will give you my tho'ts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der two Heads, diſtinctly. (1) GOD is the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, abſolute Lord of all Creatures. (2.) In
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002816_0008_0FE64FB2AC63D4A0"/>
a peculiar manner, he is the <hi>Leader</hi> of a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſing People.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>GOD</hi> is the ſupreme, abſolute Lord of <hi>all Creatures.</hi> He is the univerſal <hi>Firſt Cauſe;</hi> infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely &amp; abſolutely Perfect; and therefore muſt have an unlimited, unalienable, perpetual and univerſal Dominion over all Creatures; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly over all his reaſonable Creatures; Perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or Relatively: Singly, or in Society. <hi>No Authority</hi> can poſſibly be, but from GOD. <hi>All Power</hi> is limited by his moſt perfect Will, duely notified. <hi>No Power</hi> can be againſt him. Theſe are all Truths moſt evident to Reaſon; and their Contraries draw after them the moſt abſurd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences; nay flat Contradictions. And the Scriptures clearly exhibit them as ſuch to us, Dan. 4. 24. <hi>Till thou knoweſt that the moſt high ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he will.</hi> Pſal. 145. 13. <hi>Thy kingdom is an everlaſting kingdom; and thy dominion thro' out all generations.</hi> Pſal. 135. 5. <hi>I know, that the Lord is great above all gods; whatſoever the Lord plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; that did he, in heaven, earth, ſeas,</hi> &amp;c. The univerſal Influence &amp; Agency of GOD, here af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, includes a <hi>Moral,</hi> as well as a Natural or Phyſical Power; <hi>Right,</hi> as well as <hi>Strength.</hi> Once more, That celebrated, but very much vexed and abuſed Text is very clear &amp; full Proof Rom. 13. 1.—<hi>No power but of God: the powers that be, are ordained of God.</hi> 'Tis not poſſible there ſhould be any, but what flows from this only Fountain of Being &amp; Power: And it's equally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for GOD to deny himſelf, and give any Creature a Power againſt himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:002816_0009_0FE64F839DEAB8D0"/>
But I proceed,</p>
            <p n="2">2. GOD is in a peculiar manner the <hi>Leader</hi> of his <hi>Own People.</hi> Here I will mention to you, ſome of the <hi>Diſtinctions</hi> &amp; <hi>Characters</hi> of this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Government.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It's founded in ſpecial <hi>Relations,</hi> and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar <hi>Works</hi> of GOD. <hi>Iſrael</hi> became his Subjects, and he their Leader; by new, near &amp; endearing Relations &amp; peculiar diſplays of his Wiſdom, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er &amp; ſovereign Bounty. And thus it is in a Degree with reſpect to every profeſſing People.</p>
            <p>They are formed, redeemed, ſeparated to GOD, by ſpecial diſplays of Divine Perfections: New and very near Relations between GOD &amp; them ariſe from theſe ſpecial Operations.

He, or the Father by him, manageth the Kingdom of Providence and Grace to them. And how many delightful things doth this Contemplation ſuggeſt to us: Moſt certainly, This Adminiſtrator makes it a peculiar Government, and exhibits it ſuch.

This of a <hi>Shepherd,</hi> is an Alluſion which anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Writers, Sacred &amp; Common, have very much delighted in: They have ſet it in the moſt beautiful &amp; advantageous Lights, to repreſent a well-regulated, wiſe &amp; happy Government by; and to give the beſt Inſtructions to the Conduct of Rulers. 'Tis a very lively &amp; natural Emblem; and we find the ſupreme Ruler himſelf uſing it, to give us the juſt &amp; honourable Ideas of his own Government.</p>
            <p>In general, I have already obſerved to you, That the Metaphor of a <hi>Shepherd</hi> carrys an happy mixture of Tenderneſs &amp; Authority, Power &amp; Care, Protection &amp; Diſcipline.</p>
            <p>GODs ſpecial Government includes all theſe, we are ſure it muſt.

            </p>
            <p>And if we add to this, An Enquiry into Fact; as upon infallible Scripture Record, we ſhall find GOD exerciſing this Tenderneſs &amp; Authority all along, in his Dealings with his People.</p>

1. GOD <hi>Directs</hi> &amp; <hi>Preſcribes</hi> to his People, in a very <hi>peculiar</hi> manner. He ſhines to his own People, in the ſtrongeſt Light, as abſolutely So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, and infinitely Wiſe &amp; Good; in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his Laws, which in the beſt manner poſſible, anſwer the great End of his Glory, and his People's Happineſs.

He adjuſts all their Troubles in the beſt manner, to their being humbled, purged, made wiſer &amp; better; and to their being reſtored to their former Station with advantage. He Acts towards them, with the Temper &amp; Intentions of a <hi>Shepherd;</hi> and his ways are Analogous to the <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd'</hi>s wiſeſt &amp; kindeſt Actions towards this beloved Charge. GOD don't grieve &amp; wound willingly, and with Pleaſure; but for neceſſary great &amp; good Purpoſes, which they themſelves will be Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for, when GOD's Diſpenſations are opened fully to them. Read, Deut. 8. 2. <hi>And thou ſhalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God hath led thee, to prove thee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. GOD <hi>bears with them,</hi> with a <hi>ſovereign,</hi> but <hi>wiſe, Patience.</hi> He don't immediately ſtrike upon every Offence. Involuntary Offences, ariſing from I firmity, are covered with the Tenderneſs of a Parent. GOD ſpeaks, convinces, warns,

uſeth the moſt rational, gentle Applications, when theſe prevail, to bring back his People to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves &amp; Duty: He repents, &amp; forbears the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned &amp; impending Evil. However, He glorifys his Patience, and proclaims his Name, <hi>Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering,</hi> before he proceeds to his heavier ſtrokes: Eſpecially, before he puts the laſt hand of Vengeance to his ſtrange Work. They are great Sins, and obſtinately continued in, that draw down Vengeance. The Publick is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by a Publick &amp; heavy Guilt, where the Puniſhment is publick &amp; heavy.

He reſtrains and bounds the Enemies Rage, and ſecures His own; and ſo far, they are intirely ſafe: No evil can poſſibly come without his Knowledge; none poſſibly againſt his Will.

Here I will obſerve the following Order; (1.) Offer ſome general <hi>Explanation</hi> or <hi>Illuſtration.</hi> (2.) An Hint in <hi>Proof</hi> very briefly. (3.) Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it with the <hi>Character</hi> of a good Ruler.</p>
            <p n="1">1 I will offer ſome general <hi>Explanation.</hi> Whenſoever a People enjoy an excellent Form of Government &amp; good Rulers, it's GOD's Gift. His Power &amp; Favour are very remarkable in it. The Agency of the Sovereign GOD in this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, may be diſtinguiſhed into <hi>Extraordinary</hi> and <hi>Ordinary.</hi> GOD gives as really &amp; truly, when a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are in Poſſeſſion of theſe Bleſſings, in the <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> Methods of Providence, as in the <hi>Extraordinary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Underſtandings of a People are enlightned and directed to Contrive ſuch a Scheme of Government, as beſt anſwers all the great Ends of Society &amp; Government: And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al there's ſuch a Concurrence of Circumſtances and Inclinations, as to bring it in, &amp; eſtabliſh it; GOD is as truely the Author of that Scheme &amp; Form, as if declared by a voice from Heaven, and received &amp; eſtabliſhed by the moſt miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Operations &amp; Appearances.</p>
            <p>Again, When in the Ordinary ways of Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Experience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Men are qualified for, ſpirited to, and introduced into the proper Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons &amp; Opportunities to employ them for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good; it is as really GOD's Work as if they were Inſpired, and called out extraordinarily, by Name, to the honourable Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>Once more, When the Deſigns of ſubtle &amp; powerful Tyrants againſt a People's juſt Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are daſhed, and their valuable Rights are preſerved or reſtored, it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

and precious Gifts when done by Ordinary, as well as Extraordinary Methods.</p>
            <p>In theſe mentioned Inſtances, there's GOD's ſtamp: they are eſtabliſhed by his Approbation and Authority, as well as bro't to paſs by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; not only the Agency of the firſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Cauſe, but the Authority of the ſupreme Lord &amp; Lawgiver. The renowned <hi>David</hi> is an Inſtance of both the Ordinary &amp; Extraordinary manner of Introduction. GOD furniſhed and ſpirited him to Government, by Extraordinary &amp; Immediate Impreſſions; but withal he formed him to it, by bringing him into the King's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and accuſtoming him to War, &amp; publick Buſineſs. GOD appointed him King by an <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate</hi> Deſignation; but yet the Tribes Choſe him. This is the Excellent Man of whom GOD ſays, Pſal. 78. 71, 72. <hi>He choſe David,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He bro't Jacob to feed his people.</hi>

But tho' I thus Guard; yet I ſuppoſe upon the ſtricteſt ſearch &amp; the beſt Judgment, it will be found, that generally, and for the moſt part, theſe Bleſſings are given, when a People in Covenant, are Upright &amp; Faithful in it.

Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wiſdom &amp; Prudence is ſuch, to the Conduct of Publick Affairs. This Wiſdom takes in a great Variety of Things; and I don't pretend here to a perfect account of them I will only hint in a word, That this Vertue is qualified for, conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted &amp; actuated in Government, by an extended Knowlege of Men &amp; Things; and particularly, the Methods of Government: And might I at all go into particulars, I would mention the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the diſtinct Knowlege of the People to be Govern'd, in their Hiſtory, their Conſtitution

If you En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, You I find this one Remarkable in <hi>Moſes'</hi>s Character: There's no queſtion to be made of it, but he had large meaſures of Prudence, by ſpecial Impreſſions from above.

            <p>But there are high Degrees, and a conſtant Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, neceſſary in the Government of ſome Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and in ſome Seaſons &amp; Circumſtances. <hi>Moſes</hi> was bro't to the Government of an head-ſtrong People; very fordid &amp; untaught in ſome regards: Accuſtomed to the Diſcipline of <hi>Slaves;</hi> who when bro't into the Condition of a <hi>Free</hi> People, hardly knew how to uſe their Freedom with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and to bear the neceſſary Reſtraints.
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002816_0021_0FE64F964F9889D8"/>
The wiſe Conduct of ſuch a People required an uncommon Meekneſs &amp; Patience. Again, <hi>Moſes</hi> was to lead them thro Wants &amp; Difficulties, and innumerable Hazards. Theſe to the low &amp; ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but eſpecially, the corrupt Inclinations, are ſtrong temptations to Diſcontents, Murmurings, Rebellions againſt Rulers; and muſt require an invincible Patience, and ſteady Calm in Rulers, to Maſter them, and to prevent the infinite Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs that ariſe from them.</p>
            <p>GOD made and ſent them, a <hi>Moſes,</hi> the moſt ſignal ſtroke, and ſpecial Glory of whoſe Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, was his <hi>Meekneſs</hi> &amp; <hi>Patience: Now the man Moſes was very meek, above all the men that were upon the face of the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Like <hi>Moſes,</hi> he muſt be <hi>very Juſt.</hi> Juſtice is certainly eſſential to the grand Baſis of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; one of the grand Pillars upon which it reſts; without which, Power degenerates into Tyranny and Self-Intereſt. Prov. 14. 34. <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> very particularly in it's Rulers, <hi>exalteth a Nation.</hi> Prov. 16. 4. <hi>The Throne is eſtabliſhed by Righteouſneſs.</hi> It's given us therefore among the moſt vital Parts of a Ruler's Duty, 2 Sam. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 23. <hi>The Rock of Iſrael ſpake to me; the God of Iſrael ſaid, He that Ruleth over men muſt be Juſt.</hi> This Vertue enobled &amp; exalted by Grace, ſhone very bright among <hi>Moſes'</hi>s Excellencies; and we find it very ſolemnly recommended in <hi>Jethro'</hi>s Advice, Exod. 18. 14,—21. <hi>Moreover, Thou ſhalt provide Men of Truth.</hi>

and Largeneſs of Soul. Nothing ſo proper, ſo lovely, ſo God like. 'Tis the Expectation both of GOD and Man, that Rulers be Fathers and Benefactors to their People: put on the Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Fathers; and expreſs it, in their being go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the Publick Good, in their whole Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration; and in their exquiſite ſenſe of the Publick Proſperity &amp; Adverſity. A Private, narrow ſelfiſh Spirit in a Publick Perſon, is moſt loathſome to GOD &amp; Man; brings Infamy, and a Curſe upon the Guilty, and innumerable Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions &amp; Miſchiefs upon the People.

Read, Exod. 32. 32. <hi>If not, I pray thee blot me out of thy book.</hi> And, Numb. 14. 12, 13, 14, 15.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Like <hi>Moſes,</hi> of ſteady <hi>Authority</hi> &amp; <hi>Courage.</hi> Authority in a Ruler's management; I mean a due exerting the coercive Power lodged with him for the Publick Safety &amp; Honour, is always neceſſary in ſome Degree, let the Times be never ſo Calm. <hi>Reſolution</hi> &amp; <hi>Courage</hi> are the Guardians of this Authority and it's Life &amp; Spirit; and a degree of theſe is always requiſite therefore in the ſmoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt Time.

into, they become peculiarly Neceſſary; and they muſt exert themſelves with Vigour. Without very reſolute Counſels &amp; couragious Executions of them, all would be loſt in ſome Junctures. An happy Union, and prudent Exerciſe of theſe, are then a People's very Life.</p>
            <p>Let us enquire, and we ſhall find <hi>Moſes</hi> the Meek &amp; Tender Father of his People; to whom his People was dearer than himſelf; yet when the Honour of GOD, and the Publick Good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired it, we then find him a Man of Majeſty, armed with Terrors.</p>
            <p>Government can't be inſulted, &amp; ſo weakned, without inexpreſſible Damage &amp; Hazards to the People; (the great End of Government.) 'Tis for the People's ſake, not their own, that Rulers muſt exhibit this Coercive Power, and uſe the Sword of the Revenger; and not willingly ſuffer the Lawleſs at home, or Enemies abroad, to deſpiſe and trample on them. Look upon <hi>Moſes</hi> in that moſt ſeaſonable &amp; holy Tranſport, Exod. 32. 26. <hi>And Moſes ſaid, Who is on the Lord's ſide, Who?</hi> And, Exod. 17. 9. <hi>And Moſes ſaid to Joſhua, and go fight with Amaleck.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. It's very deſirable, that like <hi>Moſes,</hi> they have GOD's <hi>Image,</hi> and in it's moſt high &amp; emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Degrees to <hi>Sanctify</hi> them. This will Exalt all their Faculties &amp; Qualifications for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This excellent Image crowns all other Qualifications; infuſeth an holy &amp; excellent Ferment into all that directs &amp; ſtimulates them to their great End.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> was a renowned Man of GOD, for his uncommon meaſures of true ſanctifying Grace.
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002816_0024_0FE64FC5A51364E0"/>
And Rulers ſhould ſo Excel, as to be Examples to all about them, of every gracious Diſpoſition and Action to GOD &amp; Man. You ſee <hi>Moſes'</hi>s true Temper &amp; Spirit, in his deep Concern for GOD<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s Honour; the ſureſt Sign of Grace that can be Numb. 14. 13, 14. <hi>And Moſes ſaid, The Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans will hear it</hi>—.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Like him, Men of <hi>Prayer</hi> &amp; <hi>Power</hi> with GOD. <hi>Moſes</hi> was <hi>ſo,</hi> very gloriouſly; and ſo ſhould all Rulers. Jer. 15. 1. <hi>Tho' Moſes and Samuel stood before me.</hi> Numb. 21. 7. <hi>And Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Prayed for the People.</hi> Thus they may do more for the Publick Good, than by all their Wiſdom, Authority, Courage, nay, than by the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Strength &amp; Riches of their whole Government.</p>
            <p>Thus I have finiſhed the <hi>Character;</hi> the thing principally in my Deſign, and will go more briefly thro' what remains.</p>
            <p>PROP. <hi>IV.</hi> It is to be Notic'd &amp; Celebrated as an <hi>high Favour</hi> of GOD to his People, when he leads them <hi>like a Flock,</hi> by the hand of Wiſe and Good Rulers GOD's taking upon himſelf the Relation of their <hi>Leader,</hi> in ſo peculiar a manner as you have heard; and his exerciſing that Government as a <hi>Shepherd,</hi> carrys moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Grace in every Article of it, as might be ſhown, would my Bounds allow it: But paſſing the Reſt, I ſhall conſider the peculiar Favour of His Government, which appears in excellent Civil Privileges &amp; Rulers; and this under Two Heads. (1.) Theſe Privileges &amp; Government are a moſt <hi>free</hi> &amp; <hi>great Favour;</hi> even to the <hi>beſt</hi> People. (2) It is to be <hi>Noticed</hi> &amp; <hi>Celebrated</hi> as ſuch by them.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:002816_0025_0FE64F97E2F79D48"/>
1. It is a <hi>free</hi> &amp; <hi>great Favour</hi> of GOD, even to the beſt People, to give them ſuch <hi>Privileges</hi> and <hi>Rulers.</hi> I muſt ſay a word or two to the <hi>Greatneſs,</hi> and then to the Divine <hi>Freedom</hi> and <hi>Sovereignty</hi> in them.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Civil Privileges,</hi> and a <hi>good Government,</hi> are very <hi>great</hi> Benefits to a People. Theſe very nearly &amp; vitally affect all the Particulars of a People's Welfare. It might be Inſtanced at large, were it proper here; in their Religion &amp; Morals; and in their external Order, Peace, univerſal Proſperity. The happy Fruits are <hi>Good Laws;</hi> prudent, ſteady, tender, but yet <hi>reſolute Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution</hi> of them: <hi>Learning</hi> &amp; <hi>Arts</hi> flouriſh: <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry</hi> is encouraged: <hi>Trade, Husbandry, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures</hi> encreaſe: The Publick <hi>Prudentials</hi> &amp; <hi>Exigencies</hi> faithfully &amp; wiſely Conducted. All theſe have a moſt direct &amp; <hi>natural</hi> Influence upon their Honour &amp; Safety. And to conclude, Such Rulers do abundance to engage the <hi>Divine moſt gracious Preſence</hi> with ſuch a People. Indeed their Prudence &amp; Holineſs, and fervent Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions won't do alone, without agreable Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons &amp; Department in the People; but they do a great deal with GOD, to keep off Judgments, and to procure Publick Bleſſings. They have great Power with GOD <hi>by their Prayers,</hi> to open his Infinite Stores. Deut. 9. 18, 19. <hi>Let me alone, that I may deſtroy them:</hi>—<hi>But the Lord hearkned to me at that time alſo.</hi> They do abundance by <hi>holy Examples,</hi> and powerful <hi>Influences,</hi> in their eminent Stations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to prepare the People for a <hi>Covenant-Enjoyment</hi> of theſe Bleſſings; as the Hiſtory of the reforming Kings of <hi>Jud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

(2.) They are moſt <hi>Free</hi> &amp; <hi>Sovereign</hi> Benefits, even to the <hi>beſt</hi> &amp; <hi>pureſt</hi> People. No People can have any Claim to theſe Benefits, but by GOD's moſt ſovereign Promiſe. 1 Sam. 12. 22. <hi>For the Lord will not forſake his People, for his great Name ſake; becauſe it hath pleaſed the Lord to make you his People.</hi> And a People's Claim by a ſincere Performance of the Covenant-Terms, is the glorious work of ſovereign, irreſiſtible Grace. Jer. 31. 3. <hi>Yea. I have loved thee, with an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Love: Therefore with loving kindneſs have I drawn thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Theſe Free &amp; Great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> muſt be <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed</hi> &amp; <hi>Acknowledged.</hi> I only juſt mention the Heads which might have been enlarged on, if the bounds of a ſingle Sermon would have allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. Duty, Gratitude, and Intereſt unite to preſs their Obligations, and ſet them in the ſtrongeſt Light.</p>
            <p>A People's Notice &amp; Acknowlegement is all the Return they can poſſibly make. GOD the Giver being Infinitely above them: They being entirely dependent on him: And He being abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely incapable of any real Addition &amp; Benefit. 1 Cor. 4. 7. <hi>Who maketh thee to differ?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>GOD will notwithſtanding graciouſly Accept, thro' <hi>Chriſt,</hi> His People's ſincere Acknowlege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. He graciouſly lets us know, He accounts himſelf Honoured by them, and is highly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with them, <hi>Pſal</hi> 50. 23. <hi>Whoſo offereth praiſe gloriſyeth me.</hi> And we are ſure he will Reward our grateful Offerings, with the Magnificence of the only &amp; bleſſed Potentate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the King of Kings, in the moſt illuſtrious Benefits.</p>

               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:002816_0027_0FE64F980AF88C48"/>
And now I ſhould have proceeded to have ſaid what theſe Returns are, which a People muſt make to GOD for theſe Benefits; and which muſt be agreable to the Perfection &amp; Majeſty of GOD; and therefore ſuch as himſelf requires: And theſe might have been Deſcribed at large under the following Heads.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A People muſt offer ſolemn &amp; hearty <hi>Praiſe</hi> for them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 23.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They muſt be wiſely improved to their <hi>Ends, viz GOD's Honour,</hi> the promoting our own <hi>Spiritual</hi> &amp; <hi>Outward Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. All wiſe <hi>Endeavours</hi> muſt be uſed for their <hi>Continuance.</hi> Particularly, Thoſe Iniquities muſt be Mourned for, Reformed &amp; Watched againſt, which diſhonour &amp; provoke the Sovereign GOD to Frown upon a People, and Remove them: What theſe are, it becomes all, both Rulers and People, diligently to ſearch out, and reſolutely deſtroy.</p>
