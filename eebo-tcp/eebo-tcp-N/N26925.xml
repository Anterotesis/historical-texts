            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THE following production is one of my favorite children; it ſpeaks to the heart, and without ornament, or perſonal beauty, is recommended by all the chaſte virtues, and intereſting attributes, of the moſt favored mortal.</p>
            <p>I know not any individual, to whom a model of conjugal excellence, of refined underſtanding, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive accompliſhments, can with more propriety be devoted, than to the confided friend, the cultivated companion, the amiable partner, of a character, in which <hi>America</hi> glories, and whom the world venerates.</p>
            <p>Yet the writer of theſe pages ſupplicates no patron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and ſolicits no ſupport, except the flattery of your eſteem, the encouragement of your approbation; and is leſs influenced by the benefit ſhe may derive, than by the emulation ſhe feels, in expreſſing the high re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and admiration, with which ſhe has the honor to conſider herſelf</p>

            <head>Advertiſement.</head>
            <p>IF in a former publication the Author of theſe pages has attempted to portray the ſublime Virtues of Nature—with more ſolicitude, though with leſs encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement, ſhe ventures on the preſent occaſion to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, by a brilliant example, that the higher grades of civilized Society are no leſs productive of the pre-eminent qualities of fidelity and magnanimity, than the unſpoiled and uncultivated communities of the foreſt.</p>
            <p>The ſubject, founded upon a pathetic occurrence of the American Revolution, is principally ſelected from a little book, containing letters of General Burgoyne: deeply affected by the intereſting recital, the Author has not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired of inſpiring the ſame ſympathy in others; and, under that impreſſion, again preſumes to appear before the public tribunal.</p>
            <p>The leading features of the following ſketch are literally drawn agreeably to the few characteriſtic outlines, which could be obtained; and the ornaments of Poetry have added but little to the deſcription of a patient, perſevering, <hi>fortitude,</hi> which, in diſplaying the individual, ennobles the whole ſpecies.</p>
