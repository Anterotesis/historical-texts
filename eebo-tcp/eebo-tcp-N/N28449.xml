            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE VOICE OF WARNING, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IF a manly attempt to avert national ruin, by exposing a favorite error, should excite no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment, nor draw any obloquy upon its author, there would certainly be a new thing under the sun. Men can seldom bear contradiction. They bear it least when they are most demonstrably wrong; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, having surrendered their judgment to preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, or their conscience to design, they must take refuge in obstinacy from the attacks of reason. The bad, dreading nothing so much as the prevalence of pure principle and virtuous habit, will ever be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious in counteracting it; and the more candid, rational and convincing the means employed in its behalf, the louder will be their clamor, and the fiercer their opposition. On the other hand, good men are often led insensibly astray, and their very honesty becomes the guarantee of their delusion. Unaware, at first, of their inconsistency, they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards shrink from the test of their own profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. Startled by remonstrance, but unprepared to recede; checked by the misgivings of their own minds, yet urged on by their previous purpose and connection, the conflict renders them irritable, and they mark as their enemy whoever tells them the truth. From the coincidence of such a bias with the views of the profligate and daring, results in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calculable mischief. The sympathy of a common cause unites the persons engaged in it; the shades
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037904_0004_101029EA41D62760"/>
of exterior character gradually disappear; Virtue sinks from her glory; Vice emerges from her infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; the best and the basest appear nearly on a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel; while the most atrocious principles either lose their horror, or have a veil thrown over them: and the man who endeavors to arrest their course, is singled out as a victim to revenge and madness. Such, from the beginning, has been the course of the world. None of its benefactors have escaped its calumnies and persecutions: not prophets, not apostles, not the Son of God himself. To this treatment, therefore, must every one be reconciled, who labors to promote the best interests of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. He must stake his popularity against his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity; he must encounter a policy which will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with nothing short of his ruin; and if it may not spill his blood, will strive to overwhelm him with public execration. That this is the spirit which has pursued a writer, the purity of whose views is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led only by their importance—I mean the author of "<hi>Serious Considerations on the Election of a Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi>" I need not inform any who inspect the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zettes. To lay before the people of the United States, proofs that a candidate for the office of their first ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, is an unbeliever in the scriptures; and that to confer such a distinction upon an open enemy to their religion, their Redeemer, and their hope, would be mischief to themselves and sin against God, is a crime never to be forgiven by a class of men too numerous for our peace or prosperity. The infidels have risen <hi>en masse,</hi> and it is not through <hi>their</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration that he retains any portion of his respecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility or his usefulness. But in <hi>their</hi> wrath there is nothing to deprecate; nor does he deserve the name of a Christian, who, in order to avoid it, would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate an hair's breadth from his duty. For them I write not. Impenetrable by serious principle, they
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037904_0005_101029EEAE163BA8"/>
are not objects of expostulation, but of compassion; nor shall I stoop to any solicitude about their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure or applause.</p>
            <p>But do I represent as infidels all who befriend Mr. Jefferson's election? God forbid that I should so "lie against the truth." If I thought so, I should mourn in silence: my pen should slumber forever. That a majority of them profess, and that multitudes of them really love, the religion of Jesus, while it is my terror, is also my hope. Terror, because I believe them to be under a fatal mistake; hope, because they, if any, are within the reach of conviction. I address myself to them. The latter, especially, are my brothers, by dearer ties and higher interests than can be created or destroyed by any political connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And if it be asked, Why mingle religion with questions of policy? Why irritate by opposition? Why risk the excitement of passions which may disserve, but cannot aid, the common Christianity? Why not maintain a prudent reserve, and permit matters of State to take their own course? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, Because Christians are deeply engaged already: Because the principles of the gospel are to regulate their political, as well as their other, conduct: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their Christian character, profession and pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity are involved in the issue. This is no hour to temporize. I abhor that coward spirit which vaunts when gliding down the tide of opinion, but shrinks from the returning current, and calls the treason <hi>prudence.</hi> It is the voice of God's providence not less than of his word,
<q>Cry aloud, spare not; lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and the house of Jacob their sins.</q>
With Christians, therefore, I <hi>must</hi> expostulate; and may not refrain. However they may be displeased, or threaten, I will say, with the Athenian chief, "<hi>Strike, but hear me.</hi>"</p>

FELLOW CHRISTIANS,</p>
            <p>A crisis of no common magnitude awaits our country. The approaching election of a President is to decide a question not merely of preference to an eminent individual, or particular views of policy, but, what is infinitely more, of national regard or disregard to the religion of Jesus Christ. Had the choice been between two infidels or two professed Christians, the point of politics would be untouched by me. Nor, though opposed to Mr. Jefferson, am I to be regarded as a partizan; since the principles which I am about to develope, will be equally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptable to many on both sides of the question, I dread the election of Mr. Jefferson, because I believe him to be a confirmed infidel: you desire it, because, while he is politically acceptable, you either doubt this fact, or do not consider it es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential. Let us, like brethren, reason this matter.</p>
            <p>The general opinion rarely, if ever, mistakes a character which private pursuits and public func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have placed in different attitudes; yet it is frequently formed upon circumstances which elude the grasp of argument even while they make a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful and just impression. Notwithstanding, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the belief of Mr. Jefferson's infidelity, which has for years been uniform and strong, wherever his character has been a subject of speculation— although that infidelity has been boasted by some, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by many, and undisputed by all, yet as it is now denied by his friends, the charge, unsupported by other proof, could hardly be pursued to convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Happily for truth and for us, Mr. Jefferson has <hi>written;</hi> he has <hi>printed.</hi> While I shall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline auxiliary testimony, I appeal to what he never retracted, and will not deny, his <hi>Notes on Virginia.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">The edition which I use is the second American edition, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished at Philadelphia, by Matthew Carey, 1794.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:037904_0007_101029F2020CE318"/>In their war upon revelation, infidels have levelled their batteries against the miraculous <hi>facts</hi> of the scripture: well knowing that if its historical truth can be overturned, there is an end of its claim to inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. But God has protected his word. Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the UNIVERSAL DELUGE, the most stupendous miracle of the old testament, is fortified with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable evidence. The globe teems with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations of it. Every mountain and hill and valley lifts up its voice to confirm the narrative of Moses. The very researches and discoveries of infidels themselves, contrary to their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, their wishes and their hopes, are here compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to range behind the banner of the bible. To at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack, therefore, the scriptural account of the deluge, belongs only to the most desperate infidelity. Now, what will you think of Mr. Jefferson's Christianity, if he has advanced positions which strike directly at the truth of God's word concerning that wonderful event? Let him speak for himself:
<q>It said that shells are found in the Andes, in South America, fifteen thousand feet above the level of the ocean. This is considered by many, both of the learned and unlearned, <hi>as a proof of an universal deluge.</hi> But to the <hi>many considerations opposing this opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion,</hi> the following may be added: The atmos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere and all its contents, whether of water, air, or other matters, gravitate to the earth; that is to say, they have weight. Experience tells us, that the weight of all these columns together, never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds that of a column of mercury of 31 inches high. If the whole contents of the atmosphere then were water, instead of what they are, it would cover the <hi>globe but</hi> 35 <hi>feet deep:</hi> but, as these wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as they fell, would run into the seas, the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial measure of which is to that of the dry parts of the globe, as two to one, the seas would be raised
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037904_0008_101029F3B48F2788"/>
only 52½ feet above their present level, and of course would <hi>overflow the land to that height only.</hi> In Virginia this would be a very small proportion even of the champaign country, the banks of our tide-waters being frequently, if not generally, of a greater height. Deluges beyond this extent then, as for instance, to the North mountain or to Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tucky, seem out of the laws of Nature. But within it they may have taken place to a greater or less degree, in proportion to the combination of natural causes which may be supposed to have produced them.—But such deluges as these, will not account for the shells found in the higher lands. A second opinion has been entertained, which is, that in times anterior to the records either of history or tradition, the bed of the ocean, the principal residence of the shelled tribe, has, by some great convulsion of nature, been heaved to the heights at which we now find shells and other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of marine animals. <hi>The favorers of this opinion do well to suppose the great events on which it rests to have taken place beyond all the aeras of history; for within these certainly none such can be found;</hi> and we may venture to say further, that no fact has taken place either in our own days, or in the thousands of years recorded in history, which proves the existence of any natural agents within or without the bowels of the earth, of force sufficient to heave to the height of 15,000 feet, such masses as the Andes.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Jefferson's Notes on Virginia, p. 39—41.</note> After mentioning another opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion proposed by Voltaire, Mr. J. proceeds,
<q>There is a wonder somewhere. Is it greatest on this branch of the dilemma; on that which supposes the existence of a power of which we have no evidence in any other case; or on the first which requires us to believe the creation of a body of water and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037904_0009_101029F7357A46F0"/>
its subsequent annihilation?</q>
Rejecting the whim of Voltaire, he concludes, that <q>the three hypotheses are <hi>EQUALLY</hi> unsatisfactory, and we must be content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to acknowledge, that this great phenomenon is, as yet, unsolved.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Jefferson's Notes on Virginia, p. 42.</note>
            </p>
            <p>On these extracts, I cannot suppress the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reflections.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Mr. Jefferson disbelieves the existence of an universal deluge.
<q>
                  <hi>There are</hi> MANY CONSIDERA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIONS,</q>
says he, "OPPOSING <hi>this opinion.</hi>" The bible says expressly,
<q>
                  <hi>The waters prevailed exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly upon the earth,</hi> and ALL THE HIGH HILLS THAT WERE UNDER THE WHOLE HEAVEN <hi>were covered.</hi>
               </q>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Gen. vii. 19.</note> Mr. Jefferson enters into a philosophical argument to prove the fact impossible; that is, he argues in the very face of God's word, and, as far as his reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing goes, endeavors to convict it of falsehood.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Mr. Jefferson's concession of the probability of deluges within certain limits, does not rank him with those great men who have supposed the deluge to be partial, because his argument con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes directly against the scriptural narrative, even upon that supposition. He will not admit his partial deluges to rise above 52 ½ feet above the level of the ocean.

These <hi>do</hi> declare most unequivocally, that there was such a "great convulsion of nature" as produced a deluge infinitely more formidable than Mr. Jefferson's philosophy can digest. But he will not so much as allow them to be history: he degrades them even below tradition. We talk of times for our flood, he tells us, <q>anterior to the records either of his<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory or tradition.</q> Nor will it mend the matter, to urge that he alludes only to profane history. The fact could not be more dubious or less deserving a place in the systems of philosophy, from the attest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of infallible truth. And is this truth to be spurned as no <hi>history;</hi> as not even <hi>tradition?</hi> It is thus, Christians, that a man whom you are expected to elevate to the chief magistracy, insults yourselves and your bible.<note n="†" place="bottom">Nay, as it is only the scripture which authenticates the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular belief of an universal deluge, Mr. Jefferson's insinuation can hardly have any meaning, if it be not an oblique stroke at the bible itself.

And for whom does Mr. J. write? For Christians? None of them ever dreamed that the deluge was caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any thing else than a miracle. For infidels? Why then does he not tell them that the scripture alone gives the true solution of this "great phenomenon?" The plain matter of fact is, that he writes like all other infidels, who admit nothing for which they cannot find adequate "natural agents;" and when these fail them, instead of resorting to the divine word, which would often satisfy a modest enquirer, by revealing the "arm of JEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH," they shrug up their shoulders, and cry, "Ignorance is preferable to error."<note n="†" place="bottom">Notes on Virginia, p. 42.</note>

Mr. Jefferson's argument against the flood is, in substance, the very argument by which infidels have attacked the credibility of the Mosaic history. They have always objected the insufficiency of water to effect such a deluge as that describes. Mr. J. knew this. Yet he adopts and repeats it. He does not deign so much as to mention Moses: while through the sides of one of his hypotheses, he strikes at the scriptural history, he winds up with pronouncing all the three to be
<q>
                  <hi>equally</hi> unsatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory.</q>
Thus reducing the holy volume to a level with the dreams of Voltaire! Let me now ask <hi>any</hi> Christian, Would you dare to express yourself in a similar manner upon a subject which has received the decision of the living God? Would you patiently hear one of your neighbors speak so irreverently of his oracles? Could you venture to speculate on the deluge without resorting to them? Would you not shudder at the thought of using, in support of a philosophical opinion, the arguments which infidels bring against that WORD

which is the source of all your consolation; much more to use them without a lisp of respect for it, or of caution against mistake? Can he believe the bible who does all this? Can an infidel do more without directly assailing it? What then must you think of Mr. Jefferson?</p>
            <p>But it was not enough for this gentleman to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit the story of the deluge. He has advanced a step farther, and has indicated, too plainly, his disbelief in the common origin of mankind. The scriptures teach that all nations are the offspring of the first and single pair, Adam and Eve, whom God created and placed in paradise. This fact, interwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with all the relations and all the doctrines of the bible, is alike essential to its historical and religious truth. Now what says the candidate for the chair of your president? After an ingenious, lengthy, and elaborate argument to <hi>prove</hi> that the blacks are naturally and morally inferior both to white and red men; and that

               <note n="‡" place="bottom">ib. 201.</note> He does, indeed, discover some compunction in reflecting on the consequences of his philosophy.

the public that Mr. Jefferson by "distinct race" and "difference of race," means nothing more than that the negroes are only a branch of the great family of man, without impeaching the identity of their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin. This construction, though it may satisfy many, is unfounded, absurd, and contradicted by Mr. Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferson himself. Unfounded: For when Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers treat of man as a "subject of natural history," they use the term "race," to express the <hi>stock</hi> from which the particular families spring, and not, as in the popular sense, the families themselves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard to their original. A single example, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the opinions of two philosophers, of whom the one, M. de Buffon, maintained, and the other, Lord Kames, denied the common origin of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, will prove my assertion.</p>
            <p>
               <q>M. Buffon, from the rule, that animals which can procreate together, and whose progeny can also procreate, are of one species, concludes, that all men are of <hi>one race</hi> or species.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Kames's Sketches, vol. i. p. 24.</note> Mr. Jeffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, writing on the same subject with these authors, and arguing on the same side with one of them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly uses the term "race" in the same sense. And as the other construction is unfounded, it is also absurd. For it represents him as laboring through nearly a dozen pages to prove what no man ever thought of doubting, and what a glance of the eye sufficiently ascertains, viz. that the blacks and whites are different branches of a common family. Mr. Jefferson is not such a trifler; he fills his pages with more important matter, and with deeper sense. And by expressions which cut off evasion, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts the meaning which his friends have invented for him. He enumerates a variety of
<q>distinctions which <hi>prove a difference</hi> of race.</q>
These dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions he alledges are not accidental, but
<q>physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</q>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:037904_0014_10102A05B4679A88"/>
i. e. founded in <hi>nature.</hi> True, alarmed at the boldness of his own doctrine, he retreats a little. His PROOFS evaporate into a SUSPICION; but that suspicion is at a loss to suspect, whether the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority of the blacks (Mark it well, reader!) is owing to their being
<q>
                  <hi>ORIGINALLY</hi> a distinct race, or made distinct by time and circumstances.</q>
Branches of the <hi>same stock</hi> ORIGINALLY distinct, is a contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Mr. Jefferson therefore means, by different races, men descended from different stocks. His very "<hi>tenderness</hi>" is tinctured with an infidel hue. A conclusion corresponding with his speculations, affects him, becauſe it
<q>would degrade a whole race of men from the rank in the scale of beings which their Creator may perhaps have given them.</q>
So then; the secret is out! What RANK <hi>in the scale of beings</hi> have we, obeying the scripture, been accus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to assign to the injured blacks? The very same with ourselves, viz. that of children of one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon father. But if Mr. Jefferson's notions be just, he says they will be <hi>degraded</hi> from that rank; i. e. will appear not to be children of the same father with us, but of another and inferior stock. But though he will not speak peremptorily, he strongly insinuates that he does not adopt, as an article of his philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, the descent of the blacks as well as the whites from that pair which came immediately from the hands of God. He is not sure. At best it is a <hi>doubt</hi> with him—
<q>the rank which their Creator may PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HAPS have given them!</q>
—Now how will all this accord with revealed truth? God, says the Apostle Paul,
<q>Hath made <hi>of ONE BLOOD ALL NATIONS</hi> of men, for to dwell on <hi>ALL</hi> the face of the earth.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xvii. 26.</note> 
               <hi>Perhaps</hi> it may be so, replies Mr. Jefferson; but there are, notwithstanding, <hi>physical distinctions</hi> PROV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING <hi>a difference of race.</hi> I cannot repress my indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation!

That a miserable, sinful worm, like myself, should proudly set up his "proofs" against the truth of my God and your God, and scout his veracity with a sceptical PERHAPS! I intreat Christians to consider the sweeping extent of this infidel doctrine of "different races." If it be true, the history of the bible, which knows of but <hi>one,</hi> is a string of falsehoods from the book of Genesis to that of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation; and the whole system of redemption, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated on the <hi>unity</hi> of the human race, is a cruel fiction. I ask Christians again, whether they would dare to speak and write on this subject in the stile of Mr. Jefferson? Whether any believer in the word of the Lord Jesus, who is their hope, could enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain such doubts? Whether a writer, acute, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and profound, like Mr. Jefferson, could, as he had before done in the case of the deluge, pursue a train of argument, which he knew infidels before him had used to discredit revelation, and on which they still have great reliance—Whether, instead of vindicating the honor of the scripture, he could, in <hi>such</hi> circumstances, be as mute as death on this point; countenancing infidels by inforcing their sentiments; and yet be a Christian? The thing is impossible And were any other than Mr. Jefferson to be guilty of the same disrespect to God's word, you would not hesitate one moment in pronouncing him an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel.</p>
            <p>It is not only with his philosophical disquisitions that Mr. Jefferson mingles opinions irreconcileable with the scriptures. He even goes out of his way for the sake of a fling at them. "Those," says he,
<q>who labor in the earth, are the chosen people of God, IF EVER HE HAD A CHOSEN PEOPLE, whose breasts he has made his <hi>peculiar</hi> deposit for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial and genuine virtue.</q>

In the first place, Mr. Jefferson doubts if ever God had a chosen people. In the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, if he had, he insists they are no other than those who labor in the earth. At any rate, he denies this privilege to the seed of Abraham; and equally denies your being his people, unless you follow the scythe and the plow. Now, whether this be not the lie direct to the whole testimony of the bible from the beginning to the end, judge ye.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Some have been vain enough to suppose that they destroy this proof of Mr. J's infidelity, by representing his expression "the chosen people of God, if ever he had a chosen people," as synoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous with the following: "A. B. is an honest man, if ever there was an honest man," which so far from doubting the existence of honest men, that it founds, in the certainty of this fact, the asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of A. B's honesty. On this wretched sophism, unworthy of good sense, and more unworthy of candor, I remark,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the expressions are by no means similar. The whole world admits that there are honest men, which makes the proposition, "A. B. is an honest man, if ever there was an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest man," a strong assertion of A. B's honesty. But the hundredth part of the world does not admit that God had a chosen people, and therefore the proposition that "those who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor in the earth are the chosen people of God, if ever he had a chosen people," is, upon this construction, no assertion at all that the cultivators of the soil are his people, because there are millions who do not believe the fact on which it must be founded: viz. that he <hi>had</hi> a chosen people.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That if the expressions were parallel. Mr. J. would still be left in the lurch, because the first asserts A. B. to be as much an honest man as any man that ever lived; and so Mr. J. asserts "those who labor in the earth" to be as much the "chosen peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God," as any people that ever lived. This is still the lie direct to the whole bible, and the inventors of this lucky shift, must set their wits at work to invent another.</p>

            <p>Ponder well this paragraph. Ten thousand im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties and mischiefs lurk in its womb. Mr. Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferson maintains not only the inviolability of <hi>opinion,</hi> but of opinion <hi>propagated.</hi> And that no class or character of abomination might be excluded from the sanctuary of such laws as he wishes to see esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, he pleads for the impunity of <hi>published</hi> er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in its most dangerous and execrable form. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytheism or atheism, "twenty gods or no god," is perfectly indifferent in Mr. Jefferson's good citizen. A wretch may trumpet atheism from New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire to Georgia; may laugh at all the realities of futurity; may scoff and teach others to scoff at their accountability; it is no matter, says Mr. Jefferson, "it neither picks my pocket, nor breaks my leg." This is nothing less than representing civil society as founded in atheism. For there can be no reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion without God. And if it does me or my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor no injury, to subvert the very foundation of religion by denying the being of God, then religion is not one of the constituent principles of society, and consequently society is perfect without it; that is, is perfect in atheism. Christians! what think you of this doctrine? Have you <hi>so</hi> learned Christ or truth? Is Atheism indeed no injury to society? Is it no injury to untie all the cords which bind you to the God of Heaven, and your deeds to his throne of judgment; which form the strength of personal vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, give energy to the duties, and infuse sweetness into the charities, of human life? Is it indeed no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to you, or to those around you, that your neighbor buries his conscience and all his sense of moral obligation in the gulph of atheism? Is it no
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037904_0018_10102A1006CF7438"/>
injury to you, that the oath ceases to be sacred? That the eye of the Omniscient no more pervades the abode of crime? That you have no hold on your dearest friend, farther than the law is able to reach his person? Have you yet to learn that the peace and happiness of society depend upon things which the laws of men can never embrace? And whence, I pray you, are righteous laws to emanate, if rulers, by adopting atheism, be freed from the coercion of future retribution? Would you not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be scourged with sword and famine and pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, than see your country converted into a den of atheism? Yet, says Mr. Jefferson, it is a harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less thing.
<q>It does me no injury; it neither picks my pocket, nor breaks my leg.</q>
This is perfectly of a piece with his favorite wish to see a government administered without any religious principle among either rulers or ruled. Pardon me, Christian: this is the morality of devils, which would break in an instant every link in the chain of human friendship, and transform the globe into one equal scene of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation and horror, where fiend would prowl with fiend for plunder and blood—yet atheism
<q>neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg.</q>
I will not abuse you by asking, whether the author of such an opinion can be a Christian? or whether he has any regard for the scriptures which confines all wisdom and blessedness and glory, both personal and social, to the fear and the favor of God?</p>
            <p>The reader will observe, that in his sentiments on these four points, the <hi>deluge</hi>; the <hi>origin of nations;</hi> the <hi>chosen people of God;</hi> and <hi>Atheism,</hi> Mr. Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferson has comprized the radical principles of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity in its utmost latitude. Accede to his posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on these, and he will compel you to grant the rest. There is hardly a single truth of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation which would not fall before one or other

of them. If the deluge be abandoned, you can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend neither the miracles, nor inspiration of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. If men are not descendants of one common stock, the doctrine of salvation is convicted of es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential error. If God never had any chosen people but the cultivators of the soil, the fabric of the New Testament falls to the ground; for its foundation in the choice of Israel to be his peculiar people, is swept away. And if the Atheism of one man be not injurious to another, society could easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense not only with his word but with his worship.</p>
            <p>Conformable with the infidelity of his book, is an expression of Mr. Jefferson contained in a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph which I transcribe from the pamphlet entitled <hi>"Serious Considerations," &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>When the late Rev. Dr. John B. Smith resid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Virginia, the famous MAZZEI happened one night to be his guest. Dr. Smith having, as usual, assembled his family for their evening de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, the circumstance occasioned some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course on religion, in which the Italian made no secret of his infidel principles. In the course of conversation,</q>
he remarked to Dr. Smith,
<q>Why your great philosopher and statesman, Mr. Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferson, is rather farther gone in infidelity than I am;</q>
and related, in confirmation, the following anecdote: That as he was once riding with Mr. Jefferson, he expressed his
<q>surprise that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this country take no better care of their public buildings.</q>
"What buildings?" exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mr. Jefferson. "Is not that a church?" re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied he, pointing to a decayed edifice. "Yes," answered Mr. Jefferson. "I am astonished," said the other, "that they permit it to be in so ruinous a condition." "<hi>It is good enough,</hi>" re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined Mr. Jefferson,
<q>for him that was born in a

            <p>Some of Mr. Jefferson's friends have been des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate enough to challenge this anecdote as a calumny fabricated for electioneering purposes. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they pretend, it is incontestibly true, that the story was told, as here repeated, by Dr. Smith. I, as well as the author of "Serious Considerations," and several others, heard it from the lips of Dr. Smith years ago, and more than once. The ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny, if any, lies either with those who impeach the veracity of a number of respectable witnesses, or with MAZZEI himself. And there are not wanting, among the followers of Mr. Jefferson, advocates for this latter opinion. He must have been a wretch indeed, to blacken his brother-philosopher, by trumping up a deliberate lie in order to excuse his own impiety in the presence of a minister of Christ! If such was MAZZEI, the <hi>philosopher,</hi> it is our wisdom to think, and think again, before we heap our largest honors upon the head of his <hi>bosom-friend.</hi>

But when to these you add his solicitude for wresting the bible from the hands of your children—his notoriously unchristian character—his disregard to all the ordinances of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worship—his utter and open contempt of the Lord's day, insomuch as to receive on it a public entertainment;<note n="†" place="bottom">At Fredericksburgh, in Virginia, in 1798.</note> every trace of doubt must vanish.

In vain are we told that Mr. Jefferson's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct is modest, moral, exemplary, I ask no odious questions. A man must be an adopt in the higher or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of profligacy, if neither literary occupation, nor the influence of the surrounding gospel, can form or controul his habits. Though infidelity and licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness are twin sisters, they are not compelled to be always in company; that I am not a <hi>debauchee,</hi> will therefore be hardly admitted as proof that I am not an <hi>infidel</hi> —In vain are we reminded, that the "Notes on Virginia" contain familiar mention, and respectful acknowledgment, of the being and attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God. Though infidelity leads to Atheism, a man may be an infidel without being an Atheist. Some have even pretended, that anxiety for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of God, prompted them to fix the brand of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture upon the scripture! But where has Mr. Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferson, when stating his <hi>private opinions,</hi> betrayed the least regard for the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ?—In vain is it proclaimed, that he maintains a Christian minister at his own expence. I shall not enquire whether that maintenance does or does not arise from the product of glebe lands attached to many southern estates. Taking the fact to be simply as related, I <hi>will</hi> enquire whether prudent and political men never contribute to the support of Christianity from <hi>other</hi> motives than a belief of its truth? Mr. Jefferson may do all this and yet be an infidel. VOLTAIRE, the vile, the blasphemous Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:037904_0022_10102A1BC1E98080"/>
was building churches, and assisting at the mass, while he was writing to his <hi>philosophical</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidants, concerning your divine Saviour, CRUSH THE WRETCH! In vain is the
<q>
                  <hi>ACT</hi> for establishing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious freedom,</q>
which ſlowed from the pen of Mr. Jefferson, and passed in the Assembly of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, in 1786, paraded as the triumph of his Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian creed. I protest against the credibility of the witness! That act, I know, recognizes
<q>the Holy Author of our religion,</q>
as
<q>Lord both of body and mind,</q>
and possessing "Almighty power;" and by censuring "fallible and uninspired men," tacitly acknowledges both the inspiration and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the sacred writers. But Mr. Jefferson is not here declaring his <hi>private opinions:</hi> for these we must look to his Notes, which were published <hi>a year after,</hi> and abound with ideas which contradict the authority of the scriptures. He speaks, in that act, as the organ of an <hi>Assembly</hi> PROFESSING CHRISTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ANITY; and it would not only have been a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous absurdity, but more than his credit and the Assembly's too, was worth, to have been disrespect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, <hi>in an official deed,</hi> to that Redeemer whose name they owned, and who was precious to many of their constituents. <hi>Such</hi> Christianity is common with the bitterest enemies of Christ. Herbert, Hobbes, Blount, Toland, Tindal, Bolingbroke, Hume, Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire, Gibbon, at the very moment when they were laboring to argue or to laugh the gospel out of the world, affected great regard for our
<q>holy reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</q>
and its divine author. There is an edict of Frederic the II. of Prussia, on the subject of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious toleration, couched in terms of the utmost reverence for the Christian religion, and yet this same Frederic was one of the knot of conspirators, who, with Voltaire at their head, plotted the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:037904_0023_10102A1D631235E0"/>
of Christianity: and whenever they spoke of its "Holy Author," echoed to each other, <hi>Crush the wretch!</hi> This <hi>act,</hi> therefore, proves nothing but that, at the time of its passing (we hope it is so still) there was religion enough in Virginia, to curb the proud spirit of infidelity.</p>
            <p>CHRISTIANS! Lay these things together: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them; examine them separately, and collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively: ponder; pause; lay your hands upon your hearts; lift up your hearts to heaven, and pronounce on Mr. Jefferson's Christianity. You cannot stifle your emotions; nor forbear uttering your indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant sentence—INFIDEL!!</p>
            <p>This point being settled, one would think that you could have no difficulty about the rest, and would instantly and firmly conclude,
<q>Such a man ought not, and as far as depends on me, shall not, be President of the United States!</q>
But I calculate too confidently. I have the humiliation to hear this inference controverted even by those whose "good confession" was a pledge that they are feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly alive to the honor of their Redeemer. No, I am not deceived: they are <hi>Christian</hi> lips which plead that
<q>Religion has nothing to do with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litics</q>
—that <hi>to refuse our suffrages on account of religious principles, would be an interference with the rights of conscience</hi>—that <hi>there is little hope of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing a real believer, and we had better choose an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel than a hypocrite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That religion has, in <hi>fact,</hi> nothing to do with the politics of many who profess it, is a melancholy truth. But that it has, of <hi>right,</hi> no concern with political transactions, is quite a new discovery. If such opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, however, prevail, there is no longer any mys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery in the character of those whose conduct, in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical matters, violates every precept, and slanders
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:037904_0024_101020E6F1FE2438"/>
every principle, of the religion of Christ. But what is politics? Is it not the science and the exercise of civil rights and civil duties? And what is reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? Is it not an obligation to the service of God, founded on his authority, and extending to all our relations personal and social? Yet <hi>religion has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with politics!</hi> Where did you learn this maxim?

That all the passion and violence, the fraud and falsehood, and corruption which pervade the sys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tems of party, and burst out like a flood at the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic <hi>elections,</hi> are to be blotted from the catalogue of unchristian deeds, because they are <hi>politics?</hi> Or that a minister of the gospel may see his people, in their political career, bid defiance to their God in breaking through every moral restraint, and keep a guiltless silence because <hi>religion has nothing to do with politics?</hi> I forbear to press the argument far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; observing only, that many of our difficulties and sins may be traced to this pernicious notion. Yes, if our religion had had <hi>more</hi> to do with our poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics;
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:037904_0025_10102A1F30AE14F8"/>
if, in the pride of our <hi>citizenship,</hi> we had not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten our <hi>Christianity:</hi> if we had prayed more and wrangled less about the affairs of our country, it would have been infinitely better for us at this day.</p>
            <p>But you are afraid that to refuse a man your suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages because he is an infidel, would <hi>interfere with the rights of conscience.</hi> This is a most singular scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and proves how wild are the opinions of men on the subject of liberty. Conscience is God's of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer in the human breast, and its rights are defined by his law. The right of conscience to trample on his authority is the right of a rebel, which entitles him to nothing but condign punishment. You are afraid of being unkind to the conscience of an <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del.</hi> Dismiss your fears. It is the last grievance of which he will complain. How far do you sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Mr. Jefferson consulted his <hi>conscience</hi> when he was vilifying the divine word, and preaching insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection against God, by preaching the harmlessness of Atheism? But supposing Mr. Jefferson to be <hi>conscientiously</hi> impious, this would only be a stronger reason for our opposition. For the more consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious a man is, the more persevering will he be in his views, and the more anxious for their propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If he be fixed, then, in dangerous error, faithfulness to God and truth requires us to resist him and his conscience too; and to keep from him the means of doing mischief. If a man thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self bound in conscience, whenever he should be able, to banish God's sabbath, burn his churches, and hang his worshippers, would you entrust him with power out of respect to conscience? I trow not. And why you should judge differently in the case of an infidel who spurns at what is dearer to you than life, I cannot conceive. But in your so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:037904_0026_10102A21E626E050"/>
for the conscience of Mr. Jefferson, have you considered, in the mean time, what becomes of your <hi>own</hi> conscience.? Has it no rights? no voice? no influence? Are you not to keep it void of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence towards God? Can you do this in elevat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his open enemies to the highest dignity of your country? Beware, therefore, lest an ill-directed care for the conscience of another, bring your own under the lashes of remorse. Keep this clear, by the word of God, and there is little hazard of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring your neighbor's. But how can you interfere with any man's conscience by refusing him a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical office? You do not invade the sanctuary of his bosom: you impose on him no creed: you simply tell him you do not like him, or that you prefer another to him. Do you injure him by this? Do you not merely exercise the right of a citizen and a Christian? It belongs essentially to the freedom of election, to refuse my vote to any candidate for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of conscience, of state, of predilection, or for no reason at all but my own choice. The rights of conscience, on his part, are out of the question. He proposes himself for my approbation. If I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, I give him my support. If not, I withhold it. His conscience has nothing to do with my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; but to my <hi>own</hi> conscience they are serious things. If he be an infidel, I will not compel him to profess Christianity. Let him retain his infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, enjoy all its comforts, and meet all its conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. But I have an unquestionable right to say,
<q>I cannot trust a man of such principles: on what grounds he has adopted them is not my concern; nor will his personal sincerity alter their tendency. While he is an infidel, he shall never have my countenance. Let him stay where he is: and let his conscience be its own reward.</q>
I could
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:037904_0027_10102A2667193F30"/>
not blame another for such conduct to me; for he only makes an independent use of his privilege, which does me no injury: nor am I to be blamed for such conduct to another, for I only make the same use of my privilege, which is no injury to him. Mr. Jefferson's conscience cannot, therefore, be wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed if you exclude him from the presidency because he is an infidel; and your own, by an act of such Christian magnanimity, may escape hereafter many a bitter pang. For if you elect Mr. Jefferson, though an infidel, from a regard to what you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the rights of conscience, you must, in order to be consistent, <hi>carry your principle through.</hi> If infidelity is not a valid objection to a candidate for the presidency, it cannot be so to a candidate for any other office. You must never again say,
<q>We will not vote for such a man because he is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel.</q>
The evil brotherhood will turn upon you with your own doctrine of the "rights of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence." You must then either retract, or be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to see every office filled with infidels. How horrible, in such an event, would be the situation of your country! How deep your agony under the torments of self-reproach!</p>
            <p>But there is no prospect, you say, of obtaining a real Christian, and we had <hi>better choose an infidel than a hypocrite.</hi> By no means. Supposing that a man professes Christianity, and evinces in his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral deportment a regard for its doctrines, its wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and its laws; though he be rotten at heart, he is infinitely preferable to a known infidel. His hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisy is before God. It may ruin his own soul; but, while it is without detection, can do no hurt to men. We have a hold of him which it is impossible to get of an infidel. His reputation, his habits, his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests, depending upon the belief of his Christianity, are sureties for his behaviour to which we vainly
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:037904_0028_10102A28108CA220"/>
look for a counterbalance in an infidel; and they are, next to religion itself, the strongest sureties of man to man. His very hypocrisy is an homage to the gospel. The whole weight of his example is on the side of Christianity, while that of an open infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del lies wholly against it. It is well known that the attendance of your Washington, and of President Adams upon public worship, gave the ordinances of the gospel a respectability in the eyes of many which otherwise they would not have had: brought a train of thoughtless people within the reach of the means of salvation: and thus strengthened the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of Christians to the progress of infidelity. You can never forget the honorable testimony which Mr. Adams bore, in one of his proclamations, to a number of the most precious truths of Revelation; nor how he was abused and ridiculed for it, by not a few of those very persons who now strive to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade you that Mr. Jefferson is a Christian. In short, your President, if an open infidel, will be a centre of contagion to the whole continent: If a professed Christian, he will honor the institutions of God; and though his hypocrisy, should he prove a hypocrite, may be a fire to consume his own vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, it cannot become a wide-spreading conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Can you still hesitate? Perhaps you may. I therefore bespeak your attention to a few plain and cogent reasons, why you cannot, without violat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your plighted faith, and trampling on your most sacred duties, place an infidel at the head of your government.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The civil magistrate is <hi>God's officer. He is the minister of God,</hi> saith Paul, <hi>to thee for good.</hi>

The good man, he who shall "dwell in God's holy hill," is one

war. This neglect has excited in many of its best friends, more alarm than all other difficulties. The only way to wipe off the reproach of irreligion, and to avert the descending vengeance, is to prove, by our <hi>national acts,</hi> that the Constitution has not, in this instance, done justice to the public sentiment. But if you appoint an infidel for your President, and <hi>such</hi> an infidel as Mr. Jefferson, you will sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that neglect, you will declare, by a <hi>solemn na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional act,</hi> that there is no more religion in your col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective character, than in your written constitution: you will put a <hi>national</hi> indignity upon the God of your mercies; and provoke him, it may be, to send over your land that deluge of judgments which his forbearance has hitherto suspended.</p>
            <p>Add to this the consideration, that <hi>infidelity has awfully increased.</hi> The time was, and that within your own recollection, when the term infidelity was almost a stranger to our ears, and an open infidel an object of abhorrence. But <hi>now</hi> the term has become familiar, and infidels hardly disgust. Our youth, our hope and our pride, are poisoned with the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed leaven. The vain title of "philosopher," has turned their giddy heads, and, what is worse, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted their untutored hearts. It is now a mark of sense, the proof of an enlarged and liberal mind, to scoff at all the truths of inspiration, and to cover with ridicule the hope of a Christian; those truths and that hope which are the richest boon of divine benignity; which calm the perturbed conscience, and heal the wounded spirit; which sweeten every comfort, and soothe every sorrow; which give strong consolation in the arrest of death, and shed the light of immortality on the gloom of the grave. All, all are become the sneer of the buffoon, and the song of the drunkard. These things, Christians, you deplore. You feel indignant, as well as discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:037904_0033_10102A34327C3990"/>
at the inroads of infidel principle and profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate manners. You declaim against them. You caution your children against their infection. And yet, with such facts before your eyes, and such les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in your mouths, you are on the point of undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whatever you have done; and annihilating, at one blow, the effect of all your profession, instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and example. By giving your support to Mr. Jefferson, you are about to strip infidelity of its ignominy; array it in honors; and hold it up with eclat to the view of the rising generation. By this act, you will proclaim to the whole world that it is not so detestable a thing as you pretended; that you do not believe it subversive of moral obligation and social purity: that a man may revile your reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and blaspheme your Saviour; and yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand your highest confidence. This amounts to nothing less than a deliberate surrender of the cause of Jesus Christ into the hands of his enemies. By this single act—my flesh trembles, my blood chills at the thought! by this single act you will do more to destroy a regard for the gospel of Jesus, than the whole fraternity of infidels with all their arts, their industry and their intrigues. You will stamp credit upon principles, the native tendency of which is to ruin your children in this world, and damn them in the world to come. O God!

            <p>With these serious reflections, let me connect a fact equally serious: The <hi>whole strength of open and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive infidelity is on the side of Mr. Jefferson.</hi> You may well start! But the observation and experience of the Continent is one long and loud attestation to the truth of my assertion. I say OPEN and ACTIVE

infidelity. You can scarcely find one exception among all who preach infidel tenets among the people. Did it never occur to you, that such men would not be so zealous for Mr. Jefferson if they were not well assured of his being one of themselves —that they would cordially hate him if they supposed him to be a Christian—or that they have the most san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine hope that his election to the Presidency will promote their cause? I know, that to serve the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of the moment, those very presses which teemed with abuse of your Redeemer, are now affecting to offer incense to his religion; and that Deists them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are laboring to convince you that Mr. Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferson is a Christian; and yet have the effrontery to talk of other men's <hi>hypocrisy!</hi> Can you be the dupes of such an artifice? Do you not see in it a proof that there is no reliance to be placed on an infidel conscience? Do you need to be reminded that these infidels who now court you, are the very men who, four years ago, insulted your faith and your Lord with every expression of ridicule and contempt? That these very men circulated, with unremitting assiduity, that execrable book of Boulanger, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled <hi>Christianity Unveiled;</hi> and that equally exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable abortion of Thomas Paine, <hi>The Age of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son?</hi> That, in order to get them (especially the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) into the hands of the common people, they sold them at a very low rate; gave them away where they could not sell them; and slipped them into the pockets of numbers who refused to accept them? Do you know that some of these infidels were at the trouble of translating from the French, and printing, for the benefit of Americans, a work of downright, undisguised Atheism, with the impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing title of <hi>Common Sense?</hi> That it was openly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertised, and extracts, or an extract, published to

help the sale?<note n="*" place="bottom">The title is a trick, designed to entrap the unwary, by palm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it on them through the popularity of Paine's tracts under the same name. The title in the original, is <hi>Le bon Sens,</hi> GOOD SENSE. It was printed, I believe, in Philadelphia; but the Printer was ashamed or afraid to own it.</note> Do you know that some of the same brotherhood are secretly handing about, I need not say where, a book, written by Charles Pigott, an Englishman, entitled <hi>A Political Dictionary?</hi> Take the following sample of its impiety: (my hair stif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fens while I transcribe it)

                  <hi>Religion</hi>—a superstition invented by the arch-bishop of hell, and propagated by his faithful diocesans the clergy, to keep the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in ignorance and darkness, that they may not see the work of iniquity that is going on,</q>
&amp;c. <note n="†" place="bottom">Pigott's Political Dictionary, p. 132. This work was originally printed in England; but having been suppressed there, the whole or, nearly the whole, impression was sent over to America, and distribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the people. But in <hi>what manner,</hi> and by <hi>what means,</hi> there are <hi>some</hi> who can tell better than the writer of this pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet. It was thought, however, to be so useful, as to merit the American press.—For the copy which I possess, is one of an edition printed at New-York, for THOMAS GREENLEAF, late editor of the Argus: 1796.</note>

            <p>Such are the men with whom professors of the name of our Lord Jesus Christ are concerting the election of an <hi>infidel</hi> to the Presidency of the United States of America. Hear the word of the Lord.
<q>What fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? And what communion hath light with darkness? And what concord hath Christ with Belial? And what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?</q>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">2. Cor. v.14, 15.</note> Yet Christians are uniting with infidels in exalting an infidel to the chief magistracy! If he succeed, Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians must bear the blame. Numerous as the infidels are, they are not yet able, adored be God, to seize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no our "high places." Christians must help them, or they set not their feet on the threshold of power. If, therefore, an infidel preside over our country, it
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:037904_0036_10102A3D1E6DB7F8"/>
will be YOUR fault, Christians; and YOUR act; and YOU shall answer it? And for aiding and abetting such a design, I charge upon your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences the sin of striking hands in a covenant of friendship with the enemies of your master's glory. Ah, what will be your compunction, when these same infidels, victorious through <hi>your</hi> assistance, will "tread you down as the mire in the streets," and exult in their triumph over bigots and bigotry.</p>
            <p>Sit down, now, and interrogate your own hearts, whether you can, with a "pure conscience," be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend Mr. Jefferson's election? Whether you can do it <hi>in the name of the Lord Jesus?</hi> Whether you can lift up your heads and tell him that the choice of this infidel is for his honor, and that you promote it in the faith of his approbation? Whether, in the event of success, you have a right to look for his blessing in the enjoyment of your President? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, having preferred the talents of a man before the religion of Jesus, you ought not to fear that God will blast these talents; abandon your President to infatuated counsels; and yourselves to the plague of your own folly? Whether it would not be just to remove the restraints of his good providence, and scourge you with that very infidelity which you did not scruple to countenance? Whether you can, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some guilty misgivings, pray for the spirit of Christ upon a President whom you choose in spite of every demonstration of his hatred to Christ? Those who, to keep their consciences clean, oppose Mr. Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferson, may pray for him, in this manner, with a full and fervent heart. But to <hi>you,</hi> God may administer this dread rebuke:
<q>You <hi>chose</hi> an infidel: <hi>keep him</hi> as ye chose him: walk in the sparks that ye have kindled.</q>
Whether the threatnings of God are not pointed against such a magistrate and such a people? Be wise, Oye kings," is his commandment;
<q>
                  <pb n="39" facs="unknown:037904_0037_10102A3EC3A4E450"/>be instructed ye judges of the earth: serve the Lord with fear and rejoice with trembling: KISS THE SON, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way when his anger is kindled but a little.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Ps. ii.10—12.</note> What then is in store for a magistrate who is so far from "kissing the son," that he hates and opposes him?
<q>The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the NATIONS that FORGET God.</q>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Ps. ix.17.</note> And who forget him, if not a nation which, tho' called by his name, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless caresses, honors, rewards his enemies? The Lord hath sworn to strike <hi>through Kings in the day of his wrath.</hi>

To whatever influence they owe their determinations and their measures, it is not to the
<q>Spirit of understanding and of the fear of the Lord.</q>
Do I speak these things as a man; or saith not the scripture the same also?
<q>Woe to the rebellious children, saith the Lord, that <hi>take counsel, but not of me,</hi> and that cover with a cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>but not of my Spirit,</hi> that they may add sin to sin. That walk to go down into Egypt <hi>(and have not asked at my mouth)</hi> to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt. Therefore the strength of Egypt shall be your <hi>shame,</hi> and the <hi>trust in the shadow of Egypt your</hi> CONFUSION.</q>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Is. xxx.1—3.</note> This is the light in which God considers your confidence in his enemies. And the issue for which you ought to be prepared.</p>
            <p>I have done; and do not flatter myself that I shall escape the censure of many professed, and of some real, Christians. The stile of this pamphlet is calculated to conciliate nothing but conscience. I desire to conciliate nothing else.
<q>If I pleased men,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:037904_0038_10102A4051AB1628"/>I should not be the servant of Christ.</q>
I do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, nor wish, to fare better than the apostle of the Gentiles, who became the enemy of not a few pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors, because he <hi>told them the truth.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Gal. iv.16.</note> But the bible speaks of <q>children that will not hear the law of the Lord—which say to the seers, See not: and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things: speak unto us <hi>smooth things:</hi> prophesy deceits.</q> Here is the truth, <q>Whether you will hear, or whether you will forbear.</q> If you are resolved to persevere in elevating an infidel to the chair of your President, I pray God not to <q>choose your delusions</q>—but cannot dissemble that <q>my flesh trembleth for fear of his judgments.</q> It is my consolation that my feeble voice has been lifted up for his name. I have addressed you as one who believes, and I beseech you to act as those who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, <q>That we must <hi>all</hi> appear before the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment seat of Christ.</q> Whatever be the result, you shall not plead that you were not warned. If, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, you call to govern you an enemy to my Lord and your Lord; in the face of earth and heaven, and in the audience of your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, I record my protest, and wash my hands of your guilt.</p>
