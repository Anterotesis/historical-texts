            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>I HAVE no other apology to offer, for my venturing to appear here upon the preſent occaſion, nor do I deſire a better, than what ariſes from the concern which the late ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Provincial Congreſs had in promoting it. I am conſcious they could not chuſe me to this ſervice, in preference to my reverend fathers and brethren in the miniſtry, from an apprehenſion of ſuperior abilities; but that it was owing to a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial connexion with them, and their perſuaſion that I had a zeal, for the cauſe of liberty, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent in general, and the welfare of this Colony in particular, anſwerable to their own moſt ardent wiſhes. I ſhall endeavour to ſupport the juſtneſs of that perſuaſion, by exerciſing a faithfulneſs that would have ſuited the earlieſt days of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's ſettlement; and ſhall flatter myſelf with the moſt candid allowances from ſo reſpectable an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, as oft as my knowledge is ſurpaſſed by zeal, conſidering that the laſt ſhould predominate, now that the times call for vigorous unabating exertions.</p>

The text, upon which I ſhall ground what I have Further to ſay, you have in theſe words of the prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> recorded in the 30th chap. 20, 21. ver. <hi>Their children alſo ſhall be as aforetime, and their congregation ſhall be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed before me, and I will puniſh all that oppreſs them; and their nobles ſhall be of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi>—the ſentence is not perfected without the addition of—<hi>and their governor ſhall proceed from the midſt of them</hi>—but the wiſdom of the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental Congreſs, in which we cheerfully confide, hath reſtrained me from making it a part of the text.

            <p>SIN having entred the world, depraved mankind, and given a pernicious bias to every human heart, the beſt conſtitutions, whether civil or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, do after a while degenerate, the ſpirit of them departs, they retain only their outward forms, and by degrees loſe even thoſe. That millenian ſtate, in which many believe, could not continue vigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and flouriſhing, through the period of a thouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and years, without the conſtant miraculous inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of divine power, in reſtraining and keeping down the corrupt diſpoſition of mortal men.</p>
            <p>The Jewiſh eſtabliſhment, both in church and ſtate, was the ordinance of heaven given in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common manner, and, at the time, the beſt in the whole world; but it was ſoon corrupted, and at length ſo enormouſly, that the patience of God would not ſpare the people. The Jews were exerciſed with heavy divine judgments for their

various tranſgreſſions in civil and ſacred matters, and at laſt carried away captive to a diſtant coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. However, it was not their deſtruction, but reformation that the Lord Jehovah intended; and therefore, to encourage their repentance, by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them ſee that their caſe was not deſperate, and keep them from fainting under their ſore trials, the prophet Jeremiah is commiſſioned to deliver to them the following gracious ſoul-reviving meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, viz. "Thus ſaith the Lord, behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob's tents, and have mercy on his dwelling places: and the city ſhall be builded upon her own heap—her former foundation—and the palace ſhall remain after the manner thereof. And out of them ſhall proceed thankſgiving, and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they ſhall not be few: I will alſo glorify them, and they ſhall not be ſmall. Their children alſo ſhall be as aforetime, and their congregation or aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly (for they are ſynonimous terms) ſhall be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed before me, and I will puniſh all that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them: and their nobles—leading men of rank, the intermediate perſons between the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly and firſt magiſtrate in the land—ſhall be of themſelves; and their governor ſhall proceed from the midſt of them, and I will cauſe him to draw near, and he ſhall approach unto me: for who is this that engaged his heart to approach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, ſaith the Lord? And ye ſhall be my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and I will be your God." Here it's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed the Jews, by Him, whoſe veracity might be relied on and whoſe power could accompliſh the even<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

their old form of goverment, and that they ſhould have the ſatisfaction of ſeeing thoſe puniſhed, who had inſtrumentally occaſioned their calamities, for that the Lord himſelf would puniſh them.</p>
            <p>A people, when under national judgments or the iron rod of oppreſſion, cannot help looking back to thoſe times, when the conſtitution was in a proſperous and healthy condition—nor having an attachment to thoſe modes of government, to which they had been long habituated, and which they had experienced to be peculiarly favourable to the common rights of human nature, and to have ſecured them a greater ſhare of the ſame, than is enjoyed by mankind in general. And when they are encouraged by a divine promiſe, to look back to them as what they ſhall be re-poſſeſſed of, they muſt feel the moſt pleaſing emotions, next to thoſe ariſing from actual enjoyment.</p>
            <p>The Jews are told in our text, that <hi>their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould be as aforetime.</hi> The word <hi>children</hi> doth not neceſſarily refer to minors, being fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently uſed in a much larger ſenſe: Thus the children of Benjamin means the tribe of Benjamin—the children of Iſrael and the children of Judah, the people of Iſrael and the people of Judah. <hi>Their children</hi> may therefore intend the body of the Jewiſh nation; and <hi>their being as aforetime.</hi> their enjoying that former freedom and proſperity with which they were acquainted in the beſt days of their political exiſtence.</p>
            <p>The beſt times that the Jewiſh people ever knew were, I apprehend, thoſe of the judges; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:014073_0008_0F92DB7A10E74540"/>
their taſte for grandeur, and fooliſh fondneſs for being like neighbouring ſtates, made them weary of their plain, ſimple modes and manners, and put them upon chuſing a <hi>royal</hi> government. During the period of the judges, they were once and again, for their iniquities, given into the hand of oppreſſors: but when their vices did not bring them under the divine judgments, they were in the full enjoyment of liberty. Every man's houſe was his caſtle—every man's property was his own—he exerciſed a ſupreme authority under, and over his <hi>own</hi> vine, and his <hi>own</hi> fig-tree; and, wherein he treſpaſſed not upon the rights of his fellow creatures, nor interfered with the Moſaic eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, did that which was right in his own eyes, without being ſubject to the controul even of a crowned head, much leſs of crown officers; for in thoſe days there was no king in Iſrael. He could plant or pluck up; could build or deſtroy; could go here and there; could exerciſe domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over the fiſhes of the ſea, no leſs than over the beaſts of the field; and could trade where and in what he would.</p>
            <p>The period of the Judges was not only a time of freedom, but a time of proſperity, viewed both in a civil and ſacred light. Where fancy, the luſts of the fleſh and of the eye, together with the pride of life, captivate the judgment, the Jews may be thought to have been in the greateſt proſperity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the reign of <hi>Solomon;</hi> when the king made ſilver to be in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as ſtones, and cedars as ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo as to be the wonder of mankind. But had it been really the caſe, would the people of Iſrael have united as one, in the commencement of the next reign, and have complained, to his ſon and ſucceſſor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboam, of his grievous ſervice and heavy yoke? Would they have been ſo enraged with Rehobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am's anſwering them roughly, as to forget their fondneſs for his grandfather, and to revolt from him, crying out, "What portion have we in Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid? neither have we inheritance in the ſon of Jeſſe: to your tents, O Iſrael; now ſee to thine houſe, David"? Would all the tribes have revolted except Judah and Benjamin, where the ſeat of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was eſtabliſhed, court influence was the greateſt, and the inhabitants monopolized the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of thoſe taxes and impoſts that were col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected through the kingdom? There is a national proſperity conſiſting in ſuperfluities that catches the imagination of the vulgar, whether in high or low life, but that weakens the internal ſtrength of a people, and breeds many public diſorders. And there is a national proſperity form'd out of the temperance, valour, firmneſs and virtue of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in eaſy though not affluent circumſtances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving enough to make themſelves ſafe and happy, though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ot to entice others into the attempt of making them a prey. Of this laſt kind was the civil proſperity of the Jews in the days of the judges. The nearer a ſtate approaches to, and the more its confirmed in, this kind of civil proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, the ſafer and longer, in all probability,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:014073_0010_0F92DB7CE23631A8"/>
will be the enjoyment of its liberties. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a civil, the Jews were acquainted with a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred proſperity in the days of the judges. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing for numbers, 'tis probable that religion in the powers of it, never flouriſhed more among them, than in the beginning of that period. It is certain that Moſes was not only a lawgiver to, but a judge in Iſrael. Joſhua ſucceeded him in the exerciſe of all his power, ſubject to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of that law which Moſes had given, by which even Moſes himſelf was bound, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it from God.

Having conſider'd the firſt ſentence in our text, let us attend to the next, in which the Lord ſays, <hi>and their congregation (or aſſembly) ſhall be eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed before me.</hi> The Jews having a fixt code of laws, and a proviſion for conſulting and knowing the mind of the Lord upon ſpecial occaſions, they needed not as other free governments, an houſe of repreſentatives or aſſembly. But they had three grand feſtivals annually, when all the males, whoſe age and health admitted, repaired to Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem. The enjoyment of theſe ſtated ſeaſons, calculated, to keep up the remembrance of what great things God had done for them, at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of their national exiſtence, to promote mutual affection by bringing individuals from the moſt diſtant part of the land into an acquaintance with each other, and to afford them an opportunity for promoting any ſchemes for public utility, was conſidered as a bleſſing and not as a burden by the wiſe and prudent. The reſtoration and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of theſe ſeaſons, after they had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by the captivity, is therefore enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the catalogue of mercies with which the Jews were to be favoured. The congregation or aſſembly of the people, before the Lord in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital of the country ſhould be fixt and confirmed; be made certain and perpetual. The Jewiſh feſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivals ſhould be again obſerved with the voice of joy and the voice of gladneſs, without the hazard of a ſuſpenſion; and ſhould be even heightned by the exemplary puniſhment, that the Lord would inflict upon thoſe that oppreſſed the Jews.</p>

               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:014073_0012_0F92DB7E578C6588"/>
Thus ſaith the Lord, <hi>I will puniſh all that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them</hi> Was it abſolutely unlawful for a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to wiſh for the puniſhment of thoſe, who have been the inſtrumental occaſion of their calamities, or to have a pleaſing ſatisfaction in finding that they are puniſhed, we cannot imagine that the ſame would be promiſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in order to ſooth the ſufferings of the oppreſſed. Some may indulge a private revengeful malicious ſpirit againſt their oppreſſors, which neither ſcripture nor reaſon will juſtify: but an attachment to one's country, the cauſe of truth and equity, and the rights of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind—the love of juſtice—a deſire of benefiting the earth by public examples—and the expectation that the providential government of God will be thereby glorified, may lead us to hope that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment will be inflicted, though not upon all, yet upon the chief promoters of our oppreſſion, and that they will not be ſuffered to eſcape God's righteous judgments in this world; while in the ſpirit of true chriſtianity we pray, that they may be brought to that unſeigned repentance and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine faith, which by intereſting them in the righteouſneſs of the bleſſed Jeſus, ſhall procure them an eſcape from the puniſhments of hell, and raiſe them to the joys of heaven. While the Lord promiſes the Jews to puniſh all that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed them, He gives them no intimation of the manner in which he would do it. They might be apt to wiſh that he would puniſh in ſome certain particular way, preferable to all others: but in this they might be diſappointed Infinite wiſdom often varies the mode of puniſhment.

            <p>We have gone over the promiſe made in our text to the Jews; we cannot view it as a divine promiſe made to ourſelves, but it may lead us, to conjecture how it was with this people in the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt days of their exiſtence—to ſearch into their degeneracies, for which we may conclude that they are now under the correction of heaven—and to remark that a reformation in principles and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, will be likely to procure the approbation of the ſupreme ruler, ſo far as to warrant our expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

that, through the orderings of his providence, the children of this colony ſhall be as aforetime, and their congregation or aſſembly ſhall be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed before him; that he will puniſh all that oppreſs them; and that their nobles ſhall be of themſelves.</p>
            <p>Suffer me, ye worthy Repreſentatives of the People, and this reſpectable audience, to ſpend a few minutes in conjecturing how it was with the colony in the earlieſt days of its exiſtence. The love of liberty, but chiefly of religion, induced the firſt ſettlers to venture acroſs the atlantic, and to take up their abode in this then inhoſpitable wilderneſs. They were under the ſtrong influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the moſt noble principles; though not perfect, and tinctur'd with the prevailing notion of the age, that religious errors were to be oppoſed by the ſword of the magiſtrate as well as of the Spirit, which produced thoſe baneful effects, that have ſtain'd their annals, and that their poſterity pretend not to juſtify: But may I not ſay, that thoſe who with rancour condemn them in the lump, without allowing for their miſconduct, from the temper and ignorance of the times as to the rights of conſcience, know not of what ſpirit they themſelves are, and would be in danger, under the like temptations, of falling into the ſame miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes. The moſt valuable diamond is not without it's flaw. And a change of circumſtances may prevail upon different religious ſects, to give up what they once viewed as leading and eſſential tenets in their profeſſion; ſo that even thoſe who are the moſt peaceably diſpoſed, may at length think with <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:014073_0016_0F92DB81613E9AD8"/>
that there is a time of war, as well as a time of peace; and that every thing is beautiful in its time.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſettlers being under the ſtrong influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the moſt noble principles, we may ſuppoſe that, in their private capacity, they exerciſed a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent diſpoſition, and aſſiſted, inſtead of prey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon, and taking an advantage of each other under their reſpective difficulties, being mindful of the apoſtolic direction, <hi>bear ye one another's bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and ſo fulfill the law of Chriſt.</hi> Gal. 6. 2—that they treated religion as a matter of importance, and were not indifferent to it—that they had their families under a proper regulation, and diſcouraged all intemperance, impiety and uncleanneſs—and that they were ſtrict in their morals. We may ſuppoſe, that in tranſacting public affairs, they were diſintereſted, were not actuated in the choice of Repreſentatives or Councellors by low ſelfiſh motives, a view to their own particular advantage, or the aggrandizing their own relations; that, when they ſought to the Lord by prayer for his guidance in their elections, they were not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and unalterably determined, right or wrong, for whom they would vote, tho' they might have thought the matter over before, and talk'd upon it among themſelves, in order to their being the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter prepared for proceeding in the buſineſs with proper expedition and regularity; that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the qualities requiſite for the perſons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to fill the ſeveral departments in the ſtate, and whether ſuch individuals were ſo qualified; that they had a regard not only to abilities, but

Theſe things have been complained of, and reported from one and another. It is well known, that I have not been long enough in the country, and cannot be ſufficiently acquainted with the characters of individuals, and the ſecrets of government, as to venture upon aſſerting that theſe complaints are in general, or in divers inſtances juſt. They may have ſprang chiefly from diſappointment, vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, malice and envy; though I cannot but fear, that the complainants have had, in paſt years, ſome foundation to go upon.</p>
            <p>Our degeneracies, we muſt conclude from the light of nature and revelation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have contributed to bring us under the preſent calamities. God, the

But the divine wiſdom could have contrived to have ſecured us theſe bleſſings, without making us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the horrors of war; and it becomes us to impute it to our tranſgreſſions, that we muſt paſs through a ſcene of difficulties, ere we can be brought to the enjoyment of them. That ſame all-perfect Being, who, as Creator, hath ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully made mankind, that vicious courſes ſhould produce, and be puniſhed by bodily diſorders; hath, as moral Governor of the world, ſo conſtituted nations, that the like courſes ſhould occaſion public diſeaſes and convulſions, for their correction, and, if not reformed, their deſtruction. Do we deſire, that our conteſt would finiſh in the manner juſt now hinted at, and that we may ſoon come to the end of our troubles, and not be deſtroyed, we ſhould certainly repent and reform.</p>
            <p>You have had it already remark'd to you, that a reformation in principles and practices will be likely to procure the approbation of the ſupreme ruler, ſo far as to warrant our expecting, that, through the orderings of his providence, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of this Colony ſhall be as aforetime, and their congregation, or aſſembly, ſhall be eſtabliſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; that He will puniſh all that oppreſs them; and that their nobles ſhall be of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. This remark remains to be inſiſted upon.
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:014073_0021_0F92DB851AF35A60"/>
I have not mentioned in it the word <hi>repentance,</hi> but a reformation in principles and practices ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily includes the thing itſelf. There can be no ſuch reformation without a change of mind, and our entertaining different thoughts of paſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, which will of courſe lead us to repent of it; and no repentance is genuine and godly, that does not produce a reformation in principles and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. We are now in an unuſual way called upon to waſh ourſelves, to make ourſelves clean, to put away the evil of our doings from before our eyes, to ceaſe to do evil, to learn to do well, and to ſeek every kind of judgment. But conſidering that the faſt recommended, much to the ſatisfaction of the religious of all denominations, by the Continental Congreſs, is at hand, when theſe matters will of courſe be fully diſcours'd of, I only touch upon them; at the ſame time obſerving, that an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of practice muſt flow from a change in princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, or our relief will moſt likely prove no better than a temporary expedient. The ſovereign of the univerſe may ſo far honour, in the ſight of the world, an outward reformation of manners, as to grant deliverance upon the account of it; but where there is nothing beyond ſuch outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation the deliverance will probably be neither complete nor permanent. Indeed ſhould we make thorough work of it, and reform in princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples as well as practices, we have ſufficient warrant to expect, that God will gratify all our wiſhes, wherein they are juſt and proper, he having once and again declared in his holy oracles what is tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamount hereto, though I ſhall quote the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſage only, out of the 18 of Jer. 7, 8. ver.

And had not the individuals of the Continental Congreſs, regardleſs of threats and wrath like the roaring of lions, boldly ventur'd to engage in maintaining our common rights, upon forming and ſupporting a Continental army, and in appointing able Generals to command it, in whom we can confide and do rejoice, but whom we cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment to any advantage, by reaſon of their being ſo ſuperior to every thing we can offer of that kind.

When we further reflect, upon the importance and goodneſs of our cauſe; how

the number of our enemies has been wonderfully kept down from time to time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> notwithſtanding the reinforcements they have been frequently receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; how they on the one hand appear to be greatly diſpirited, while on the other our forces are animated; that on the ſide of adminiſtration have been all manner of lies, deceit, wicked cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, corruption, profaneneſs and blaſphemy; but that multitudes are continually ſupplicating the divine favour and bleſſing for us. I ſay when all theſe particulars are conſidered, we are juſtified in hoping, that the proceedings of this day, inſtead of being the laſt of the kind will prove the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of our conſtitutional privileges, and that this mode of government will be <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> before the Lord. We ſhould certainly rebel againſt the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign of the univerſe in his providential diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, and reject the divine council communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us by that medium, did we not reſolve to perſiſt in our preſent oppoſition to the wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of an arbitrary miniſtry. And let but the ſeveral members of this honourable houſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives exert themſelves in their public le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative and private capacities, to bring back the manners of the people to what they were ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally, ſo that our children may be as aforetime, virtuous, diſintereſted, patriotic and pious; and to extirpate thoſe vices that have crept in unawares among us. Let them approve themſelves the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine deſcendants and ſucceſſors of thoſe that compoſed the moſt early aſſemblies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> keeping out from among them all thoſe evils, that have been complained of in paſt years: and we may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt certain, not only that our aſſemblies will be

eſtabliſhed and our nobles continue to be from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ourſelves; but that the Lord will puniſh thoſe that oppreſs us, in ſome way or other, as to him ſhall ſeem beſt, and lead the world to cry out, <hi>Verily there is a reward for the righteous: verily He is a God that judgeth in the earth:</hi> Yea, we may probably live to ſee <hi>our governor proceed from the midſt of us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall detain this venerable audience no longer than juſt to mention the few following obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>No member can conſiſtently take his place, or be admitted to ſit in the houſe of Aſſembly, who <hi>heſitates</hi> about ſetting up government, ſeeing, that the Continental Congreſs adviſed to the latter, no leſs than the choice of Repreſentatives in order to it; and that there is the like original authority for the one as the other.</p>
            <p>He that does not mean to bear a part in the public burdens of the day, but to eſcape wholly unhurt in perſon and property is no patriot; while he that, inſtead of ſerving, deſigns only to ſerve himſelf of the public, to acquire riches and raiſe a fortune out of the general calamity, muſt be really one of the worſt of men, cannot deſerve the protection of the ſtate, and when diſcover'd muſt be deteſted by every true ſon and daughter of liberty, as being a moſt odious character.</p>
            <p>There is not an individual but may be aiding and aſſiſting to the common cauſe one way or other.
