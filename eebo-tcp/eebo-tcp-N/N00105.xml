            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THe setting forth of the Publick Confession of the Faith of Churches hath a double end, and both tending to Publick Edification: First, the maintenance of the Faith intire within it self: Secondly, the holding forth of Vnity and Harmony, both amongst, and with other Churches. Our Churches here, as (by the grace of Christ) we believe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess the same Doctrine of the Truth of the Gospel, which generally is received in all the Reformed Churches of Christ in <hi>Europe:</hi> so especially we desire not to vary from the Doctrine of Faith and Truth held forth by the Churches of our Native Country. For though it be not one Native Country that can breed us all of one minde; nor ought we for to have the glorious faith of our Lord Jesus with respect of persons; yet as <hi>Paul</hi> who was himself a Jew, professed to hold forth the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Justification by Faith, and of the resurrection of the dead, according as he knew his godly Countrymen did, who were Jews by nature <hi>(Gal. 2.15. Acts 26.6, 7.)</hi> so we, who are by nature <hi>English-men,</hi> do desire to hold forth the same Doctrine of Religion (especially in Fundamentals) which we see and know to be held by the Churches of <hi>England,</hi> according to the truth of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>The more we discern (that which we do, and have cause to do with incessant mourning and trembling) the unkinde, and unbrotherly, and unchristian Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our godly Brethren and Countrymen, in matters of Church-Government; the more earnestly do we desire to see them joyned together in one common Faith, and our selves w<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th them. For this end, having perused the publick Confession of Faith, agreed upon by the Reverend Assembly of Divines at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and finding the sum and substance thereof (in matters of Doctrine) to express not their own judgements onely, but ours also: and being likewise called upon by our godly Magistrates, to draw up a publick Confession of that Faith which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly taught, and generally professed amongst us; We thought good to present unto them, and with them to our Churches, and with them to all the Churches of Christ abroad, our professed and hearty Assent and Attestation to the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Faith (for substance of Doctrine) which the Reverend Assembly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the Religious and Honourable Parliament of <hi>England:</hi> Excepting only some Sections in the <hi>25, 30,</hi> and <hi>31</hi> Chapters of their Confession, which concern Points of Controversie in Church-discipline; touching which, we refer our selves to the d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aught of Church-Discipline in the insuing Treatise.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:000159_0003_0FA2B4107944CFF8"/>The truth of what we here declare, may appear by the unanimous vote of the Synod of the Elders and Messengers of our Churches assembled at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> the l<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st of the <hi>sixth Month, 1648.</hi> which joyntly passed in these words: <hi>This Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod having perused and considered (with much gladness of heart, and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness to God) the Confession of Faith published of late by the Reverend Assembly in</hi> England, <hi>do judge it to be very holy, orthodox, and judicious in all matters of Faith: and do therefore freely and fully consent thereunto, for the substance thereof. Onely in those things which have respect to Church Government and Discipline, we refer our selves to the Platform of Church-Discipline, agreed upon by this present Assembly; and do therefore think it meet, that this Confession of Faith should be commended to the Churches of Christ amongst us, and to the Honoured Court, as worthy of their due consideration and acceptance.</hi> Howbeit, we may not conceal, that the doctrine of <hi>Vocation</hi> expressed in <hi>Chap. 10. Sect. 1.</hi> and summarily repeated <hi>Chap. 13. Sect. 1.</hi> passed not without some debate. Yet considering that the term of <hi>Vocation,</hi> and others by which it is described, are capable of a large, or more strict sense and use, and that it is not intended to binde apprehensions precisely in point of order or method, there hath been a general condescendency thereunto.</p>
            <p>Now by this our prof<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ssed consent and free concurrence with them in all the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinals of Religion, we hope it may appear to the world, that as we are a remnant of the people of the same Nation with them; so we are professors of the same common Faith, and fellow heirs of the same common Salvation. Yea moreover, as this our profession of the same Faith with them, will exempt us (even in their judgements) from suspition of Heresie; so (we trust) it may exempt us in the like sort from suspition of Schism: that though we are forced to dissent from them in matters of Church-discipline, yet our dissent is not taken vp out of arrogancy of spirit in our selves (whom they see willingly condescend to learn of them) neither is it carried with uncharitable censoriousness towards them, (both which are the proper and essential characters of Schism) but in meekness of wisdome, as we walk along with them, and follow them as they follow Christ: so where we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a different apprehension of the minde of Christ (as it falleth out in some few points touching Church-Order) we still reserve due reverence to them (whom we judge to be, through Christ, the glorious Lights of both Nations) and onely crave leave (as in spirit we are bound) to follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth, and (after the Apostles example) as we believe, so we speak.</p>
            <p>And if the example of such poor Out-casts as our selves might prevail, if not with all (for that were too great a blessing to hope for) y<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t with some or other of our Brethren in <hi>England,</hi> so far as they are come to minde and speak the same


<pb facs="unknown:000159_0004_0FA2B41139C86390"/>
thing with such as dissent from them, we hope in Christ it would not onely mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> harsh judging and condemning of one another in such differences of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as may be found in the choicest Saints; but also prevent (by the mercy of Christ) the peril of the distraction and destruction of all the Churches in both Kingdoms. Otherwise, if Brethren shall go on to bite and devour one another, the Apostle feared (as we also with sadness of heart do) it will tend to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming of them, and us all: which the Lord prevent.</p>
            <p>We are not ignorant, that (besides these aspersions of <hi>Heresie</hi> and <hi>Schism</hi>) other Exceptions also are taken at our Way of Church Government, but (as we conceive) upon as little grounds. As,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1. That by admitting none into the fellowship of our Church but Saints by calling, we rob many Parish Churches of their best Members, to make up one of our Congregations; which is not onely to gather Churches out of Churches (a thing unheard-of in Scripture) but also to weaken the hearts and hands of the best Ministers in the Parishes, by despoiling them of their best hearers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2. That we provide no course for the gaining, and calling in of ignorant, and erroneous, and scandalous persons, whom we refuse to receive into our Churches, and so exclude from the wholsome Remedy of Church D<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>scipline.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3. That in our Way, we sow seeds of division, and hindrance of edification in every family: whilest admitting into our Churches only voluntaries, the Husband will be of one Church, the Wife of another; the Parents of one Church, the Children of another; the Master of one Church, the Servants of another. And so the Parents and Masters being of different Churches from their Children and Servants, they cannot take a just account of their profiting by what they hear: yea, by this means the Husbands, Parents, and Masters, shall be chargeable to the maintenance of many other Churches and Church-Officers, besides their own: which will prove a charge and burthen unsupportable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for Answer. As to the first: For gathering Churches out of Churches, we cannot say that it is a thing unheard-of in Scripture. The first Christian Church was gathered out of the Jewish Church, and out of many Synagogues in that Church, and consisted partly of the Inhabitants of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> partly of the <hi>Galileans:</hi> who though they kept some communion in some parts of publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with the Temple, yet neither did they frequent the Sacrifices, nor repair to the S<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nhedrim for the determining of their Church-causes, but kept intire and constant communion with the Apostles Church in all the Ordinances of the Gospel. And for the first Christian Church of the Gentiles at <hi>Antioch,</hi> it appeareth to


<pb facs="unknown:000159_0005_0FA2B41282BD3F88"/>
have been gathered and constituted partly of the dispersed Brethren of the Church at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> (whereof some were men of <hi>Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Cyrene</hi>) and partly of the believing Gentiles, <hi>Acts 11.20, 21.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be said, <hi>The first Christian Church at</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>and that at</hi> Antioch, <hi>were gathered not out of any Christian Church, but out of the Jewish Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Synagogues, which were shortly after to be abolished: and their gathering to</hi> Antioch, <hi>was upon occasion of dispersion in time of Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We desire it may be considered, <hi>1.</hi> That the members of the Jewish Church were more strongly and straitly tyed by express holy covenant, to keep fellowship with the Jewish Church till it was abolished, then any members of Christian Parish churches are wont to be tyed to keep fellowship with their Parish-churches. The Episcopal <hi>Canons,</hi> which binde them to attend on their Parish-church, it is likely they are now abolished with the Episcopacy. The <hi>Common Law</hi> of the Land is satisfied (as we conceive) if they attend upon the Worship of God in any other Church, though not within their own Parish. But no such like covenant of God, nor any other Religious tye lyeth upon them to attend the Worship of God in their own Parish-church, as did lye upon the Jews to attend upon the Worship of God in their Temple and Synagogues.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Though the Jewish Temple-church at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was to be abolished, yet that doth not make the desertion of it by the members to be lawful, till it was abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished. Future abolition is no warrant for present desertion, unless it be lawful in some case whilest the Church is yet in present standing to desert it; to wit, either for avoiding of present pollutions, or for hope of greater edification, and so for better satisfaction to conscience in either. Future events (or foresight of them) do not dissolve present Relations: else wives, children servants, might desert their husbands, parents, masters, when they be mortally sick.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> What the Members of the Jewish Church did, in joyning to the Church at <hi>Antioch</hi> in time of Persecution, it may well be conceived the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>bers of any Christian Church may do the like for satisfaction of conscie<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

            <p>If it be said, <hi>These Members of the Christian Church at</hi> Jerusalem <hi>that joyned to the Church at</hi> Antioch, <hi>removed their Habitations together with their Relations: which if the Brethren of the Congregational Way would do, it would much abate the grievance of their departure from their Presbyterial Churches.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:000159_0006_0FA2B4130509BBE0"/>We verily could wish them so to do, as well approving the like removal of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, in case of changing Church-Relations (provided that it may be done without too much detriment to their outward estates) and we for our parts have done the same. But to put a necessity of removal of habitation in such a case, it is to foment and cherish a corrupt principle of making civil cohabitation, if not a <hi>formal cause,</hi> yet at least a <hi>proper adjunct</hi> of Church-Relation: which the truth of the Gospel doth not acknowledge. Now to foment an errour to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the truth of the Gospel, is not to walk with a right foot according to the truth of the Gospel, as <hi>Paul</hi> judgeth, <hi>Gal. 2.14.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> We do not think it meet or safe, for a Member of a Presbyterial Church forthwith to desert his Relation to his Church, betake himself to the fellowship of a Congregational Church, though he may discern some defect in the estate or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his own. For,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1. Faithfulness of brotherly-love in Church-Relation, requireth that the Members of the Church should first convince their Brethren of their sinful defects, and duely wait for their reformation, before they depart from them. For if we must take such a course for the healing of a private Brother, in a way of brotherly love, with much meekness and patience; how much more ought we so to walk with like tenderness towards a whole Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again, 2. By the hasty departure of sound Members from a defective Church, Reformation is not promoted, but many times retarded, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption increased. Whereas on the contrary, while sincere Members breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after purity of Reformation abide together, they may (by the blessing of God upon their faithful endeavours) prevail much with their Elders and Neighbours towards a Reformation; it may be, so much as that their El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in their own Church shall receive none to the Seals but visible Saints; and in the Classis shall put forth no authoritative act (but consultative onely) touching the Members of other Churches; nor touching their own, but with the consent (silent consent at least) of their own Church: Which two things, if they can obtain with any humble, meek, holy, faithful endeavours, we conceive they might (by the grace of Christ) finde liberty of conscience to continue their Relation with their own Presbyterial Church, without scruple.</hi>

case, passeth (for ought we know) without exception, which he gave in his <hi>4</hi>th Book of Conscience, in Answ. to <hi>2</hi> Qu. <hi>Chap. 14. Num. 16. If any</hi> (saith he) <hi>wronged with unjust vexation, or providing for his own edification, or in testimony against sin, depart from a Church where some evils are tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and joyn himself to another more pure, yet without condemning of the Church he leaveth, he is not therefore to be held as a Schismatick, or as guilty of any other sin.</hi> Where the tripartite disjunction which the judicious Doctor putteth, declareth the lawfulness of the departure of a Church-member from his Church, when either through weariness of unjust vexation, or in way of provision for his own edification, or in testimony against sin, he joyneth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to another Congregation more Reformed. Any one of these, he judgeth a just and lawful cause of departure, though all of them do not concur together. Neither will such a practise despoil the best Ministers of the Parishes of their best hearers. For,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1. Sometimes the Ministers themselves are willing to joyn with their better sort of Hearers in this way of Reformation; and then they and their Hearers continue still their Church-Relation together, yea and confirm it more straitly and strongly, by an express renewed Covenant, though the Ministers may still continue their wonted Preaching to the whole Parish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2. If the Ministers do dislike the way of those whom they otherwise count their best Members, and so refuse to joyn with them therein; yet if those Members can procure some other Ministers to joyn with them in their own Way, and still continue their dwelling together in the same Town, they may easily order the times of the publick Assembly, as to attend constantly upon the Ministry of their former Church; and either after or before the publick Assembly of the Parish, take an opportunity to gather together for the Administration of Sacraments, and Censures, and other Church-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances amongst themselves. The first Apostolick Church assembled to hear the Word with the Jewish Church in the open Courts of the Temple; but afterwards gathered together for breaking of Bread, and other acts of Church-order, from house to house.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3. Suppose Presbyterial Churches should communicate some of their best gifted Members towards the erecting and gathering of another Church, it would not forthwith be their detriment, but may be their enlargement. It is the most noble and perfect work of a living creature (<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oth in Nature and Grace) to propagate, and multiply his kinde: and it is the honour of the faithful Spouse of Christ, to set forward the work of Christ as well abroad as at home. The Church in</hi> Cant. <hi>8.8. to help forward her little Sister-Church,


<pb facs="unknown:000159_0008_0FA2B414382FED28"/>
was willing to part with her choice Materials, even Beams of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar, and such precious living stones as were fit to build a Silver Palace. In the same Book, the Church is compared sometime to a Garden, sometime to an Orchard,</hi> Cant. <hi>4.12, 13. No man planteth a garden, or orchard, but seeketh to get the choicest Herbs and Plants of his Neighbours, and they freely impart them: nor do they account it a spoil to their garden and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, but rather a glory. Nevertheless we go not so far; we neither seek nor ask the choice Members of the Parishes, but accept them being offered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be said, They are not offered by the Ministers, nor by the Parish-churches, (who have most right in them) but onely by themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It may justly be demanded what right, or what power have either the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters or Parish Church over them? Not by solemn Church-covenant; for that, though it be the firmest engagement, is not owned, but rejected. If it be by their joyning with the Parish, in the calling and election of a Minister to such a Congregation at his first coming, there is indeed just weight in such an engagement: nor do we judge it safe for such to remove from such a Minister, unless it be upon such grounds as may justly give him due satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. But if the union of such Members to a Parish Church, and to the Ministry thereof, be onely by cohabitation within the Precincts of the Parish, that union, as it was founded upon Humane Law, so by Humane Law it may easily be released. Or otherwise, if a man remove his Habitation, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveth also the bond of his Relation, and the ground of offence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4. It need not be feared, that all the best Hearers of the best Ministers, no nor the most of them, will depart from them upon point of Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Those who have found the presence and power of the Spirit of Christ breathing in their Ministers, either to their conversion, or edification, will be slow to change such a Ministry of Faith and Holiness, for the liberty of Church-order. Upon which ground, and sundry other such like, there be doubtless sundry godly and judicious Hearers in many Parishes in</hi> England, <hi>that do and will prefer their relation to their Ministers (though in a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial way) above the Congregational Confederation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>5. But if all, or the most part of the best Hearers of the best Ministers of Parishes should depart from them, as preferring in their judgements the Congregational Way; yet in case the Congregational Way should prove to be of Christ, it will never grieve the holy hearts of godly Ministers, that their Hearers should follow Christ: yea many of themselves (upon due de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation) will be ready to go along with them. It never grieved nor troubled</hi> John Baptist, <hi>that his Disciples departed from him to follow after

               <hi>To the second Exception, That we take no course for the gaining, and healing, and calling in of ignorant and erroneous persons, whom we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to receive into our Churches, and so exclude them from the Remedy of Church-Discipline.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We conceive the receiving of them into our Churches would rather lose and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt our Churches, then gain and heal them. A little Leaven laid in a lump of dough, will sooner leaven the whole lump, then the whole lump will sweeten it. We therefore finde it safer to square rough and unhewn stones before they be laid into the building, rather then to hammer and hew them when they lye unevenly in the building. And accordingly, two means we use to gain and call in such as are ignorant and scandalous:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1. The publick Ministry of the Word,</hi> upon which they are invited by coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, and required by wholsome Laws. And the Word it is, which is the power of God to salvation, to the calling and winning of Souls.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2. Private Conference,</hi> and conviction by the Elders, and other able Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of the Church: whom they do the more respectively hearken unto, when they see no hope of enjoying Church fellowship, or participation in the Sacraments for themselves or their children, till they approve their judgements to be sound and orthodox, and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>heir lives subdued to some hope of a godly conversation. What can Classical Discipline, or Excommunication it self do more in this case?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The third Exception wrappeth up in it a threefold domestical inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and each of them meet to be eschewed, 1. Disunion in families be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween each Relation. 2. Disappointment of edification, for want of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity in the governours of families to take account of things heard by their children and servants. 3. Disbursements of chargeable maintenance


<pb facs="unknown:000159_0010_0FA2B416A29BA650"/>
to the several Churches, whereto the several persons of their families are joyned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which Inconveniences either do not fall out in Congregational Churches, or are easily redressed. For, none are orderly admitted into Congregational Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but such as are well approved by good testimony to be duely observant of Family-relations: or if any otherwise disposed should creep in, they are either or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly healed, or duely removed in a way of Christ. Nor are they admitted, unless they can give some good account of their profiting by Ordinances, before the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Brethren of the Church, and much more to their Parents and Masters. Godly Tutors in the Vniversity can take an account of their Pupils; and godly Housholders in the City can take account of their Children and servants, how they profit by the Word they have heard in several Churches, and that to the greater edification of the whole Family, by the variety of such Administrations. Bees may bring the more Honey and Wax into the Hive, when they are not limited to one Garden of flowers, but may fly abroad to many.</p>
            <p>Nor is any charge expected from Wives, Children or Servants to the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Congregational Churches, further then they be furnished with personal Estates, or Livings, which may enable them to contribute of such things as they have, and not of such as they have not. God accepteth not Robbery for a sacrifice. And though a godly Housholder may justly take himself bound in conscience to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to any such Church, whereto his wife, or children, or servants do stand in Relation; yet that will not aggravate the burthen of his charge, no more then if they were received Members of the same Church whereto himself is related.</p>
            <p>But why do we stand thus long to plead exemptions from Exceptions? The Lord help all his faithful Servants (whether Presbyterial, or Congregational) to judge and shame our selves before the Lord, for all our former compliances to greater Enormities in Church-Government, then are to be found either in the Congregational or Presbyterial Way: and then surely either the Lord will clear up his own will to us, and so frame and subdue us all to one minde, and one way, <hi>(Ezek. 43.10, 11.)</hi> or else we shall learn to bear one anothers burthens in a spirit of meekness. It will then doubtless be far from us, so to attest the Discipline of Christ, as to detest the Disciples of Christ; so to contend for the <hi>seamless Coat</hi> of Christ, as to crucifie the living Members of Christ; so to divide our selves about Church communion, as through breaches to open a wide gap for a deluge of Antichristian and profane malignity to swallow up both Church and Civil State.</p>
            <p>What shall we say more? Is difference about Church-order become the inlet of all the disorders in the Kingdome? Hath the Lord indeed left us to such hardness of heart, that Church-Government shall become a snare to <hi>Zion,</hi> (as sometimes


<pb facs="unknown:000159_0011_0FA2B417DBE46D38"/>
               <hi>Moses</hi> was to <hi>Egypt,</hi> Exod. <hi>10.7</hi>) that we cannot leave contesting and contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about it, till the Kingdome be destroyed? Did not the Lord Jesus, when he dedicated his sufferings for his Church, and his also unto his Father, make it his earnest and onely prayer for us in this world, that we all might be one in him? <hi>Joh. 17.20, 21, 22, 23.</hi> And is it p<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ssible that he (whom the Father heard alwayes <hi>Joh. 11.42.</hi>) should not have this last most solemn Prayer heard and granted? or shall it be granted for all the Saints elswhere, and not for the Saints in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> so that amongst them disunion shall grow even about Church-Vnion and Communion? If it be possible for a little faith (so much as a grain of mustard-seed) to remove a mountain, is it not possible for so much strength of faith as is to be found in all the godly in the Kingdome, to remove those Images of Jealousie, and to cast those stumbling-blocks out of the way, which may hinder the free pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of brotherly love amongst Brethren? It is true indeed, the National Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant doth justly engage both Parties faithfully to endeavour the utter extirpation of the Antichristian Hierarchy, and much more of all Blasphemies, Heresies, and Errours. Certainly, if Congregational Discipline be Independent from the inventions of men, is it not much more Independent from the delusions of Satan? What fellowship hath Christ with Belial? light with darkness? Truth with Errour? The faithful <hi>Jews</hi> needed not the help of the <hi>Samaritans</hi> to re-edifie the Temple of God; yea they rejected their help when it was offered, <hi>Ezra 4.1, 2, 3.</hi> And if the Congregational Way be a way of truth, (as we believe) and if the Brethren that walk in it be zealous of the Truth, and hate every false way (as by the Rule of their holy Discipline they are instructed, <hi>2 Joh. 10, 11.</hi> then verily there is no Branch in the National Covenant, that engageth the Covenanters to abhor either the Congregational Churches, or their Way: which being duely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred, do no less effectually extirpate the Antichristian Hierarchy, and all Blasphemies, Heresies, and pernicious Errours, then the other way of Discipline doth, which is more generally and publickly received and ratified.</p>
            <p>But the Lord Jesus commune with all our hearts in secret: and He who is the King of his Church, let him be pleased to exercise his Kingly Power in our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that so his Kingdome may come into our Churches in Purity and Peace. <hi>Amen. Amen.</hi>

the questioning of the truth of the Church-estate of a company of Professors, and the truth of Membership of particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; yet we conceive the substance of it is kept, where there is a real Agreement and consent of a company of faithful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to meet constantly together in one Congregation, for the publick Worship of God, and their mutual edification: which real Agreement and consent they do express by their constant practise in coming together for the publick Worship of God, and by their religious subjection unto the Ordinances of God there:<note place="margin">Exod 19 5 &amp; 20.8 &amp; 24 3, 17 Josh. 24.18 to 24.

               <note place="margin">Numb. 8 10. Acts 6 5, 6. &amp; 13 2, 3.</note>2. This <hi>Ordination</hi> we account nothing else, but the solemn putting of a man into his Place and office in the Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he had right before by Election: being like the installing of a Magistrate in the Common-wealth. Ordination therefore is not to go before,<note place="margin">Acts 6 5, 6 &amp; 14.23.</note> but to follow Election. The essence and substance of the outward calling of an ordinary officer in the Church, doth not consist in his ordination, but in his voluntary and free Election by the Church, and in his accepting of that Election: whereupon is founded that relation between Pastor and Flock, between such a Minister, and such a People. Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation doth not constitute an officer, nor give him the essentials of his office. The Apostles were Elders, without Imposition of hands by men: <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were officers, before that Imposition of hands, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.3. The posterity of <hi>Levi</hi> were Priests and Levites, before hands were laid on them by the children of <hi>Israel.</hi>

            <p n="4">4. In such Churches where there are no Elders, Imposition of Hands may be performed by some of the Brethren orderly chosen by the Church thereunto.<note place="margin">Numb. 8.10.</note> For if the people may elect officers, which is the greater, and wherein the substance of the office consists, they may much more (occasion and need so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring) impose hands in ordination, which is less, and but the accomplishment of the other.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Nevertheless, in such Churches where there are no Elders, and the Church so desire, we see not why Imposition of Hands may not be performed by the <hi>Elders of other Churches.</hi> Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary officers laid hands upon the officers of many Churches: The Presbytery at <hi>Ephesus</hi> laid hands upon <hi>Timothy</hi> an Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4 14.

            <p n="7">7. He that is clearly loosed from his Office-relation unto that Church whereof he was a Minister, cannot be looked at as an Officer, nor perform any act of office in any other Church, unless he be again orderly called unto Office: which when it shall be, we know nothing to hinder, but Imposition of Hands also in his Ordination ought to be used towards him again.

            <p n="6">6. In case an Elder offend incorrigibly, the matter so requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, as the Church had power to call him to office, so they have power according to order (the counsel of other Churches, where it may be had,<note place="margin">Col. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>17.

            <p n="8">8. The power which Christ hath committed to the Elders,<note place="margin">Acts 20 28. &amp; 6 2 Numb 16 12. Ezek. 46 10. Acts 13.15.</note> is to feed and rule the Church of God, and accordingly to call the Church together upon any weighty occasion: when the Members so called, without just cause, may not refuse to come, nor when they are come, depart before they are dismissed; nor speak in the Church, before they have leave from the Elders;<note place="margin">Hos. 4 4.</note>


               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:000159_0027_0FA2B4266B9CA858"/>
nor continue so doing, when they require silence: nor may they oppose nor contradict the judgement or sentence of the Elders, without sufficient and weighty cause, because such pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices are manifestly contrary unto Order and Government, and inlets of disturbance, and tend to confusion.</p>
            <p n="9">9. It belongs also unto the Elders to examine any Officers or Members,<note place="margin">Rev 2 2. 1 Tim. 5.19.

In handling of offences and other matters before the Church, they have power to declare and publish the counsel and will of God touching the same, and to pronounce Sentence with consent of the Church. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they have power,<note place="margin">Numb. 6.23, to 26.</note> when they dismiss the people, to bless them in the Name of the Lord.</p>
            <p n="10">10. This power of Government in the Elders, doth not any wise prejudice the power of Priviledge in the Brotherhood; as neither the power of Priviledge in the Brethren, doth prejudice the power of Government in the Elders, but they may sweetly agree together: as we may see in the example of the Apostles, furnished with the greatest Church-power, who took in the concurrence and consent of the Brethren in Church-Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations.<note place="margin">Acts 14.15, 23. &amp; 6.2. 1 Cor. 5 4. 2 Cor. 2.6, 7.</note> Also that Scripture, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10.6. do declare, that what the Churches were to act and do in these matters, they were to do in a way of obedience, and that not onely to the direction of the Apostles,<note place="margin">Heb. 13 17.</note> but also of their ordinary Elders.</p>
            <p n="11">11. From the premises, namely, That the ordinary power of Government belonging onely to the Elders, Power of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge remaineth with the Brotherhood, (as power of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in matters of Censure, and power of liberty in matters of liberty:) It followeth, That in an Organick Church, and right Administration, all Church-acts proceed after the manner of a mixt Administration, so as no Church-act can be consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated or perfected without the consent of both.</p>

               <hi>and shewed their deeds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The weakest measure of faith is to be accepted in those that desire to be admitted into the Church; because weak Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, if <hi>sincere,</hi> have the <hi>substance</hi> of that Faith,<note place="margin">Rom. 14.1.</note> Repentance and Holiness which is required in Church-members; and such have most need of the Ordinances for their confirmation and growth in grace.<note place="margin">Mat. 12.20. Isa. 40.11.</note> The Lord Jesus would not quench the smoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flax, nor break the bruised reed, but gather the tender lambs in his arms, and carry them gently in his bosome. Such charity and tenderness is to be used, as the weakest Christian, if sincere, may not be excluded nor discouraged. Severity of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination is to be avoided.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In case any through excessive fear, or other infirmity, he unable to make their personal Relation of their spiritual estate in publick, it is sufficient that the Elders having received private satisfaction, make relation thereof in publick before the Church, they testifying their assents thereunto: this being the way that tendeth most to edification. But whereas persons are of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Abilities, there it is most expedient that they make their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and Confessions personally with their own mouth,<note place="margin">Psal 66 16.</note> as <hi>David</hi> professeth of himself.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A personal and publick Confession, and declaring of Gods manner of working upon the soul, is both lawful, expedient, and useful, in sundry respects, and upon sundry grounds. Those three thousand, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37, 41. before they were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Apostles, did manifest that they were pricked in their hearts at <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon, together with earnest desire to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from their sins, which now wounded their consciences, and their ready receiving of the word of Promise and Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.15.</note> We are to be ready to render a reason of the hope that is in us, to every one that asketh us; therefore we must be able and ready upon any occasion to declare and shew our Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for sin, Faith unfeigned, and effectual Calling,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.1. Eph. 1.18.</note> because these are the reason of a well-grounded hope. <hi>I have not hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

            <p n="6">6. This profession of Faith and Repentance, as it must be made by such at their Admission, that were never in Church-society before; so nothing hindreth, but the same way also be performed by such as have formerly been Members of some other Church, and the Church to which they now joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as Members, may lawfully require the same. Those three thousand, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. which made their Confession, were Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church of the Jews before,<note place="margin">Mat. 3 5 6.

Otherwise, if Churches might obtrude their Members, or if Church-members might obtrude themselves upon other Churches with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out due triall, the matter so requiring, both the liberty of Churches would hereby be infringed, in that they might not examine those, concerning whose fitness for communion they were unsatisfied: and besides the infringing of their liberty, the Churches themselves would unavoidably be corrupted, and the Ordinances defiled, whilst they might not refuse, but must receive the unworthy: which is contrary unto the Scripture, teaching that all Churches are Sisters,<note place="margin">Cant 8.8.</note> and therefore equal.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The like trial is to be required from such Members of the Church as were born in the same, or received their Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and were baptized in their Infancy, or minority, by virtue of the Covenant of their Parents, when being grown up unto years of discretion, they shall desire to be made partakers of the Lords Supper: unto which, because holy things must not be given unto the unworthy,<note place="margin">Mat. 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>6. 1 Cor. 11 27.</note> therefore it is requisite, that these as well as others should come to their triall and examination, and manifest their Faith and Repentance by an open Profession thereof, before they are received to the Lords Supper; and otherwise not to be admitted thereunto. Yet these Church-members that were so born, or received in their Childhood, before they are capable of being made partakers of full Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, have many Priviledges which others (not Church-members) have not: they are in Covenant with God, have the Seal thereof upon them, <hi>viz.</hi> Baptism; and so if not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated, yet are in a more hopeful way of attaining regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating

            <head>CHAP. XIII. Of Church-members their Removal from one Church to another, and of Recommendation, and Dismission.</head>
            <p>CHurch-members may not remove or depart from the Church, and so one from another as they please, nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out just and weighty cause, but ought to live and dwell toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; forasmuch as they are commanded,<note place="margin">Heb. 10 25.</note> not to forsake the assembling of themselves together. Such departure tends to the dissolution and ruine of the Body; as the pulling of stones and pieces of timber from the Building, and of members from the Natural Body, tend to the destruction of the whole.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is therefore the duty of Church-members, in such times and places where counsel may be had, to consult with the Church whereof they are Members, about their Removal,<note place="margin">Prov. 11.16.</note> that accordingly they having their approbation, may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, or otherwise desist. They who are joyned with consent, should not depart without consent, except forced thereunto.</p>

Acts 21 14.</note> the Church may not consent thereunto; for in so doing, they should not act in faith, and should partake with him in his sin. If the case be doubtful, and the person not to be perswaded, it seemeth best to leave the matter unto God, and not forcibly to detain him.</p>

If a Member be called to remove onely for a time where a Church is, Letters of Recommendation are requisite, and sufficient for communion with that Church, in the Ordinances, and in their watch; as <hi>Phoebe,</hi> a servant of the Church at <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrea,</hi> had Letters written for her to the Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> that she might be received as becometh Saints.</p>

            <p n="2">2. If an offence be private,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.23, 24.

<pb n="24" facs="unknown:000159_0035_0FA2B42CF83DB868"/>
Brother is by the mouth of the Elders to tell the Church; and if he hear the Church, and declare the same by penitent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, he is recovered and gained: and if the Church discern him to be willing to hear,<note place="margin">Tit. 3.10.</note> yet not fully convinced of his offence, as in case of Heresie, they are to dispense to him a publick Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition; which declaring the offender to lye under the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick offence of the Church, doth thereby withhold or suspend him from the holy fellowship of the Lords Supper,<note place="margin">Mat. 18.17.</note> till his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence be removed by penitent Confession. If he still continue obstinate, they are to cast him out by Excommunication.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.4 5, 11</note>3. But if the offence be more publick at first, and of a more hainous and criminal nature, to wit, such as are condemned by the light of Nature; then the Church, without such gradual proceeding, is to cast out the offender from their holy commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, for the further mortifying of his sin, and the healing of his Soul in the day of the Lord Jesus.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In dealing with an offender, great care is to be taken that we be neither over-strict or rigorous, nor too indulgent or remiss:<note place="margin">Gal 6 1.</note> our proceeding herein ought to be with a spirit of meekness, considering our selves lest we also be tempted; and that the best of us have need of much forgiveness from the Lord.<note place="margin">Mat 18.34, 35.

               <note place="margin">Mat. 18 17. 1 Cor 5 11. 2 Thess. 3 6, 14</note>5. While the offender remains excommunicate, the Church is to refrain from all Member-like communion with him in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things, and also from all familiar communion with him in civil things, further then the necessity of natural, or domestical, or civil Relations do require; and are therefore to forbear to eat and drink with him, that he may be ashamed.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Excommunication being a Spiritual Punishment, it doth not prejudice the Excommunicate in, nor deprive him of his Civil Rights, and therefore toucheth not Princes, or other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, in point of their Civil Dignity or Authority: and, the Excommunicate being but as a Publican and a Heathen,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.24, 25<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

of hearing the Word, may be permitted to persons ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, that is permitted unto Heathen. And because we are not without hope of his recovery, we are not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count him as an enemy, but to admonish him as a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p n="7">7. If the Lord sanctifie the Censure to the offender, so as by the grace of Christ he doth testifie his Repentance, with humble confession of his sin, and judging of himself,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2.7, 8.</note> giving glory unto God; the Church is then to forgive him, and to comfort him, and to restore him to the wonted brotherly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, which formerly he enjoyed with them.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The suffering of profane or scandalous livers to continue in fellowship, and partake in the Sacraments,<note place="margin">Rev. 2.14, 15, 20.</note> is doubtless a great sin in those that have power in their hand to redress it, and do it not. Nevertheless,<note place="margin">Mat 23<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3.

               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. &amp; 15.12.</note> wherein were many unworthy persons and practises, are never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to absent themselves from the Sacraments, because of the same: therefore the godly in like cases are not presently to separate.</p>
            <p n="9">9. As separation from such a Church wherein profane and scandalous persons are tolerated, is not presently necessary; so for the Members thereof, otherwise unworthy, hereupon to abstain from communicating with such a Church in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the Sacraments, is unlawful. For as it were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable for an innocent person to be punished for the faults of other, wherein he hath no hand,<note place="margin">2 Chro. 30.18.

               <note place="margin">Gal 2.11, to 14.</note> yet when he saw <hi>Peter</hi> not walking with a right foot, he publickly rebuked him before the Church. Though Churches have no more authority one over another, then one Apostle had over another, yet as one Apostle might admonish another, so may one Church admonish another, and yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out usurpation. In which case, if the Church that lyeth under offence,<note place="margin">Ma<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Nevertheless, if any Members of such a Church as liveth under publick of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, do not consent to the offence of the Church, but do in

due sort bear witness against it, they are still to be received to wonted communion;<note place="margin">Gen. 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 25.</note> for it is not equal, that the innocent should suffer with the offensive. Yea furthermore, if such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Members, after due waiting in the use of all good means for the healing of the offence of their own Church, shall at last (with the allowance of the counsel of Neighbour-Churches) withdraw from the fellowship of their own Church, and offer themselves to the fellowship of another, we judge it lawful for the other Church to receive them (being otherwise fit) as if they had been orderly dismissed to them from their own Church. 4. A fourth way of Communion of Churches, is by way of <hi>Participation.</hi> The Members of one Church occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally coming unto another, we willingly admit them to partake with us at the Lords Table, it being the Seal of our communion not onely with Christ,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.13.</note> nor onely with the Members of our own Church, but also of all the Churches of the Saints: in which regard, we refuse not to baptize their Children presented to us, if either their own Minister be absent, or such a fruit of holy fellowship be desired with us. In like case such Churches as are furnished with more Ministers then one, do willingly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford one of their own Ministers to supply the place of an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent or sick Minister of another Church for a needful season. 5. A fifth way of Church-communion,<note place="margin">Rom. 16.1.</note> is by way of <hi>Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation,</hi> when the Member of one Church hath occasion to reside in another Church; if but for a season, we commend him to their watchful fellowship by Letters of Recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but if he be called to settle his abode there, we commit him according to his desire,<note place="margin">Acts 18 27.</note> to the fellowship of their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, by Letters of Dismission. 6. A sixth way of Church-communion,<note place="margin">Acts 11.22.</note> is in case of <hi>Need</hi> to minister relief and succour one unto another,<note place="margin">Ver. 29.</note> either of able Members, to furnish them with Officers; or of outward support, to the necessities of poorer Churches,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.26, 27</note> as did the Churches of the Gentiles contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute liberally to the poor Saints at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. When a Company of Believers purpose to gather into Church-fellowship, it is requisite for their safer proceeding, and the maintaining of the Communion of Churches, that they signifie their intent unto the Neighbour-Churches, walking


<pb n="29" facs="unknown:000159_0040_0FA2B451AB4627D0"/>
according unto the Order of the Gospel,<note place="margin">Gal 2.1, 2, &amp; 9. by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.</note> and desire their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and help, and right hand of fellowship, which they ought readily to give unto them, when there is no just cause to except against their proceedings.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Besides these several wayes of Communion, there is also a way of Propagation of Churches: when a Church shall grow too numerous, it is a way, and fit season,<note place="margin">Isa 40.20. Cant. 8 8, 9.</note> to propagate one Church out of another, by sending forth such of their Members as are willing to remove, and to procure some Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to them, as may enter with them into Church estate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves. As Bees, when the Hive is too full, issue forth by Swarms, and are gathered into other Hives; so the Churches of Christ may do the same upon like necessity; and therein hold forth to them the right hand of fellowship, both in their gathering into a Church, and in the Ordination of their Officers.</p>

            <p n="2">2. Synods being Spiritual and Ecclesiastical Assemblies, are therefore made up of Spiritual and Ecclesiastical Causes.

            <p n="5">5. The Synods Directions and Determinations, so far as consonant to the Word of God, are to be received with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and submission; not onely for their agreement there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with (which is the principal ground thereof, and without which they binde not at all) but also secondarily for the Power where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are made,<note place="margin">Acts 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <head>CHAP. XI. Of the Civil Magistrates Power in Matters Ecclesiasticall.</head>
            <p>IT is lawful, profitable and necessary for Christians to gather themselves into Church-estate, and therein to exercise all the Ordinances of Christ according unto the Word,<note place="margin">Acts 2.41, 47. &amp; 4.1, 2, 3.</note> although the consent of the Magistrate could not be had thereunto; because the Apostles and Christians in their time did frequently thus practise, when the Magistrates being all of them Jewish or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, and most persecuting Enemies, would give no countenance or consent to such matters.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Church-government stands in no opposition to Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Common-wealths,<note place="margin">John 18.36. Acts 25.8.</note> nor any way intrencheth upon the Authority of Civil Magistrates in their Jurisdictions; nor any whit weakeneth their hands in governing, but rather strengtheneth them, and furthereth the people in yielding more hearty and conscionable obedience unto them, whatsoever some ill-affected persons to the wayes of Christ have suggested, to alienate the affections of Kings and Princes from the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Christ; as if the Kingdome of Christ in his Church could not rise and stand, without the falling and weakening of their Government, which is also of Christ:<note place="margin">Isa 49 23.</note> whereas the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is most true, that they may both stand together and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, the one being helpful unto the other, in their distinct and due Administrations.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Power and Authority of Magistrates is not for the restraining of Churches, or any other good works,<note place="margin">Rom 13 4. 1 Tim. 2 2.</note> but for helping in and furthering thereof; and therefore the consent and countenance of Magistrates, when it may be had, is not to be sleighted, or lightly esteemed: but on the contrary, it is part of that honour due to Christian Magistrates, to desire and


<pb n="32" facs="unknown:000159_0043_0FA2B45377C826C0"/>
crave their consent and approbation therein: which being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, the Churches may then proceed in their way with much more encouragement and comfort.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is not in the power of Magistrates to compel their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to become Church-members, and to partake at the Lords Table;<note place="margin">Zek. 44 7, 9.</note> for the Priests are reproved that brought unworthy ones into the Sanctuary: then, as it was unlawful for the Priests, so it is as unlawful to be done by Civil Magistrates.<note place="margin">Cor. 5 11.</note> Those whom the Church is to cast out if they were in, the Magistrate ought not to thrust them into the Church, nor to hold them therein.</p>
            <p n="5">5. As it is unlawful for Church-officers to meddle with the Sword of the Magistrate,<note place="margin">Mat. 2 25, 26.</note> so is it unlawful for the Magistrate to meddle with the work proper to Church-Officers. The acts of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> who were not onely Princes, but Prophets, were extraordinary, therefore not imitable. Against such usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation the Lord witnessed,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 26.16, 17.</note> by smiting <hi>Vzziah</hi> with leprosie, for presuming to offer Incense.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It is the duty of the Magistrate to take care of matters of Religion, and to improve his Civil Authority for the observing of the duties commanded in the first, as well as for observing of the duties commanded in the second Table. They are called Gods.<note place="margin">Psal. 82.2.</note> The end of the Magistrates Office, is not onely the quiet and peaceable life of the Subject in matters of Righteousness and Honesty,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.1, 2.</note> but also in matters of godliness, yea of all godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. <hi>Moses, Joshua, David, Solomon, Asa, Jehoshaphat, Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,</hi>

               <hi>Josiah,</hi> are much commended by the holy Ghost, for the putting forth their Authority in matters of Religion: on the contrary, such Kings as have been failing this way, are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently taxed and reproved by the Lord. And not onely the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> but also <hi>Job, Nehemiah,</hi> the King of <hi>Nineveh, Darius, Artaxerxes, Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> whom none looked at as Types of Christ, (though were it so, there were no place for any just objection) are commended in the Book of God, for exercising their Authority this way.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The object of the Power of the Magistrate are not things meerly inward, and so not subject to his cognizance and view, as Unbelief, Hardness of Heart, Erroneous Opinions not vented; but only such things as are acted by the outward man:


<pb n="33" facs="unknown:000159_0044_0FA2B453F7025DF0"/>
neither is their power to be exercised in commanding such acts of the outward man, and punishing the neglect thereof, as are but meer inventions, and devices of men; but about such acts as are commanded and forbidden in the Word: yea,<note place="margin">1 Kings 20.28, 42.</note> such as the Word doth clearly determine, though not alwayes clearly to the judgement of the Magistrate or others, yet clearly in it self. In these he of right ought to put forth his Authority, though oft-times actually he doth it not.</p>

If any Church, one or more, shall grow Schismatical, rending it self from the Communion of other Churches, or shall walk incorrigibly or obstinately in any corrupt way of their own, contrary to the Rule of the Word; in such case the Magistrate is to put forth his Coercive Power, as the matter shall require.<note place="margin">Josh. 22.</note> The Tribes on this side <hi>Jordan</hi> intended to make war against the other Tribes, for building the Altar of Witness, whom they suspected to have turned away therein from follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lord.</p>
