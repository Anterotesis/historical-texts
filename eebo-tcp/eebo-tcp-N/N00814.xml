            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Tryal of a Saving Intereſt in CHRIST.</head>
            <p>SINCE there be ſo many People living under the Ordinances, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending without ground, to a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Intereſt in Chriſt, and to His Favour and Salvation, as is clear, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7 22, 23. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.11, 12. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13 24. And ſince many who have good ground of Claim to Chriſt, are not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed in the confidence of His Favour, but remain in the Dark without comfort, heſitating concerning the reality of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in themſelves, and ſpeaking little to the Commendation of Religion to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, eſpecially in the time of their ſtraits. I ſhall ſpeak a little to two things of the greateſt Concernment.</p>
            <p>The one is, <hi>How a perſon ſhall know <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> he hath a true and ſpecial intereſt in Christ;
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000977_0005_0FAE8C88298FBD70"/>
and whether he doth lay luſt Claim to Gods Favour and Salvation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other is, <hi>In caſe a perſon fall ſhort in the aforeſaid Tryal, what courſe he ſhall take for making ſure God; Friendſhip and Salvation to himſelf?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>How ſhall a Man know if he hath a true and ſpecial intereſt in Chriſt, and whether he hath or may lay claim juſtly to Gods Favour and Salvation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſw. Before we ſpeak directly to the Queſtion, we ſhall premiſe ſome things to make way for the Anſwer:</p>
            <p>As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That a mans Intereſt in Chriſt, or Gracious State may be known, and that with more certainty than People do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture; yea, and the knowledge of it may be more eaſily attained unto, than many do imagine. For, not only hath the Lord commanded men to know their intereſt in Him, as a thing attainable, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. but many of the Saints have attained unto the clear perſwaſion of their Intereſt in Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in God, as their own God: How often do they call him their God, and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000977_0006_0FAE8C88AAC2B760"/>
their Portion? And how perſwaded is <hi>Paul</hi> that nothing can ſeparate him from the Love of God? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.38, 39. Therefore the knowledge of a mans Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtate is attainable; and this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, which may be attained, is no fancie and bear conceit, but it is moſt ſure; <hi>Doubtleſs thou art our Father,</hi> ſaith the Prophet in name of the Church, <hi>Iſa,</hi> 63.16. It is clear thus:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That can be no fancy, but a very ſure knowledge, which doth yield to a rational man comfort in moſt real ſtraits: But ſo doth this. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.6.

            <p>The Fourth thing that doth darken the knowledge of an Intereſt in Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t, is, <hi>Men do not condeſcend upon what would ſatisfie them.</hi> They complain that God will not ſhew unto them what He is about to do with them; but cannot yet ſay, they know what would ſatisfie about His purpoſe. This is a ſad thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Shall we think thoſe are ſerious, who have never as yet, pitched on what would ſatisfie them, nor are making earneſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry after what ſhould ſatisfie? If the Lord had left us in the dark in that matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we were leſs inexcuſable: But ſince the grounds of ſatisfaction, and the true marks of an intereſt in Chriſt, are ſo clear and frequent in Scripture, and ſo many things written that our joy may be

We may not here inſiſt to ſhew what may and ſhould ſatisfie about our Intereſt, ſince we are to ſpeak di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to it afterwards.</p>
            <p>The Fifth thing that helpeth much to keep men in the dark about their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in Chriſt, is, <hi>They pitch upon ſome mutable grounds which are not ſo oppoſite proofs of the Truths of an intereſt in Chriſt.</hi> As of the comfortable ſtate of a triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Soul ſailing before the wind, and marks, which I grant are precious in themſelves, and do make out an intereſt clearly where they are.

            </p>
            <p>As;</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It is a mistake to think, that every one who is in Chriſt, doth know that he is in Him.</hi> For many are truly Gracious, and have a good title to Eternal Life, who do not know ſo much, until it be made out afterwards, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.13. Theſe things are written to Believers, that they may know they have a true title to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life; that is, that they may know they are Believers: and ſo it is ſuppoſed they knew it not before.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It is a miſtake to think, that all who come to the knowledge of their intereſt in Chriſt, do attain an equal certainty about the ſame.</hi> One may ſay, he is perſwaded, nothing preſent or to come, can ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate him from the love of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.38.

            <p n="5">5. <hi>It is no leſs a miſtake to imagine, that the vain, groundleſs Confidence which many profane, ignorant Athieſts do main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, is this knowledge of an intereſt in Chriſt which we plead for.</hi> Many do falſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow Him to be their Father. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.41. And many look for Heaven, who will be

            <p>Having premiſed theſe things, it now followeth that we give ſome Marks, by which a man may know if he be Saving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Covenant with God, and hath a Special Intereſt in Chriſt, ſo as he may warrantably lay claim to Gods Favour and Salvation. We ſhall only pitch upon two great and principal marks, not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to trouble people with many. And before we fall upon theſe, we will ſpeak of a preparatory work of the Law, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Lord doth ordinarily make uſe, to prepare His own way in mens Souls. This may have its own weight, as a mark with ſome perſons. It is called, the work of the Law, or, the work of Humiliation. It hath ſome proportion to that Spirit of Bondage, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. and doth now under the New Teſtament
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:000977_0025_0FAE8C9F06A3C888"/>

            <p n="1">1. That we are not to ſpeak of this preparatory work of the Law, as a N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gative mark of a true intereſt in Chriſt. As if none might lay claim to Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, who hath not had this preparatory work in the ſeveral ſteps of it, as we are to ſpeak of it; for, as we ſhall hear, the Lord doth not alwayes keep that path with men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The great reaſon why we ſpeak of it is, <hi>Becauſe the Lord dealeth with many</hi> (<hi>whom He doth effectally Call</hi>) <hi>by ſome ſuch preparatory work.</hi> And to thoſe, who have been ſo dealt with, it may prove ſtrengthning; and will confirm them in laying the more weight on the marks which follow.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It may help to encourage others, who are under ſuch bondage of ſpirit, as a good prognoſtick of a gracious work to follow: for as we ſhall circumſtanciate it, it will be rarely found to miſcarry and fail of a gracious iſſue.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Where God uſeth ſuch a preparatory work, He doth not keep one way or meaſure in it, as we ſhall hear.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:000977_0026_0FAE8CA08DC187B8"/>For the more diſtinct handling of this preparatory work, we ſhall ſhortly hint the more ordinary wayes, by which the Lord leadeth people in into the Covenant Savingly, and draweth them unto Chriſt.</p>

Or, in their very Young years, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can be deeply engaged active<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Satans waves, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſuppoſed, that thoſe have ſuch a preparatory work as we are to ſpeak of. And, becauſe ſome perſons may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to this way of Effectual Calling, we offer theſe marks of it, whereby thoſe who have been ſo called may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Such uſe from their Childhood to be kept free of ordinary Pollutions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Children uſually are defiled; as Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Lying, Mocking of Religion and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious perſons, &amp;c.</hi> Thoſe whom God Calleth Effectually, He Sanctifieth them from the time of that Effectual Calling. Sin cannot have Dominion over them as over others, becauſe they are under Grace <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Religion is, as it were Natural to
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:000977_0027_0FAE8CA0AD78BF40"/>
them.</hi> I mean, they need not be much preſſed to Religious Duties, even when they are but Children; They run wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly that way, becauſe there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward principle of Love conſtraining them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5 14 ſo as they yield themſelves Servants of Righteouſneſs, without outward conſtraint, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.16.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Although ſuch know not when they were firſt acquainted with God, yet they have afterwards ſuch exerciſes of ſpirit befalling, as the Saints in Scripture</hi> (of whoſe firſt Converſion we hear not) <hi>do ſpeak of.</hi> They are ſhut out from God, upon ſome occaſion now and then, and are admitted to come nearer again, (to their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion.)

And becauſe ſome may pretend to this way of Calling, we ſhall touch ſome things moſt remarkable in that tranſaction with <hi>Zaccheus,</hi> for their clearing and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> He had ſome deſire to ſee Chriſt, and ſuch a deſire, as made him wave that which ſome would have judged pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and diſcretion, whileſt he climbeth up upon a Tree that he might ſee Him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Chriſt ſpake to his Heart, and that word took ſuch hold upon him, that preſently with Joy he did accept of Chriſt<hi>'s</hi> offer, and cloſeth with Chriſt as Lord, whileſt few of any Note were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Him.</p>
            <p>

            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He hath a due impreſſion of his former wayes, evidencing his reſpect to <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, and this he doth ſignifie

before all the Company then preſent, not caring to ſhame himſelf in ſuch things as (probably) were notour to the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Upon all theſe things, Chriſt confirmeth and ratifieth the bargain by His Word recommending to him that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of intereſt, which behoved to be between him and the Saints, and the thoughts of his own loſt Condition, if Chriſt had not come and ſought him and found him: All which are clear, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19 3, — 10. We grant the Lord calleth ſome ſo, and if any can lay claim to the ſpecial things we have now hinted, they have a good confirmation of Gods dealing with them, from that Scripture: Neither are they to vex themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the want of a diſtinct prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Law-work, if their Heart have yielded unto Chriſt. For, a Law-work is not deſirable, except for this end. Therefore Chriſt doth offer Himſelf di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly in the Scripture, and People are invited to Him: and although many will not come to Him who is the Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, until the Spirit of bondage diſtreſs them for their debt; yet if any upon the knowledge of their loſt eſtate, would flee and yield to Chriſt, none might

               </gap>ſoever He ſpake to them at His firſt meeting with them, we muſt rationally ſuppoſe, that then He diſcovered ſo much of thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſs and excellency to them as made them quit all and run after Him. And if He do ſo to any, we crave no more, ſince their is room enough there for the Phyſician. So that from all this, as ſome may be confirmed and ſtrengthned, with whom God hath ſo dealt; So there is no ground nor occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for deluding Souls to flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their condition, who remain Ignorant and Senſeleſs of their own Miſeries and Chriſts Alſufficiency, and hold faſt deceit.</p>

                  </gap>s, when He Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually calleth men at the hour of Death.</hi> We find ſomewhat recorded of this way, in that pregnant Example of the Thief on the Croſs, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.39, — 45. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this ſeems not very pertinent for the purpoſe in hand; yet we ſhall ſpeak
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:000977_0031_0FAE8CA3A9D44850"/>
a little of it, that on the one hand, men may be ſparing to judge &amp; paſs Sentence upon either themſelves or others, before the laſt gaſp. And we ſhall ſo circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiate it, that, on the other hand, none may dare to delay ſo great a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the laſt hour of their Life. We find theſe things remarkable in that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs between Chriſt and the Thief;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The man falleth at odds with his former Companion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> He dareth not ſpeak a wrong word of God, whoſe hand is on him, but Juſtifieth Him in all that is befallen him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He now ſees Jeſus Chriſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted by the world, without a cauſe, and moſt injuriouſly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly</hi> He diſcovereth Chriſt to be a Lord and a King, whileſt Enemies ſeem to have Him at under.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly.</hi> He believeth a being of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry after Death ſo really, that he prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a portion of it to the preſent ſafety of his bodily Life, which he knew Chriſt was able to grant to him at that time, and he might have choſen that with the other Thief.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Although he was much abaſed in himſelf, &amp; ſo humbled, that he pleaded,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:000977_0032_0FAE8CA62D2BA110"/>
but that Chriſt would remember him; yet he was nobly daring to throw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the Covenant, on Life and Death: and he had ſo much Faith of Chriſts Al-ſufficiency, that he judged a ſimple remembrance from Chriſt, would ſatisfyingly do his buſineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly.</hi> He acquieſed ſweetly in the Word which Chriſt ſpake to him, for the ground of his Comfort. All which are very clear in the caſe of that poor dying Man, and do prove a very real work of God upon his Heart. As this example may encourage ſome to wait for good from God, who cannot as yet lay clear claim to any Gracious work of His Spirit: So we obteſt all, as they love their Souls, not to delay their Soul-buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, hoping for ſuch a caſt of Chriſts hand in end, as too many do: This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a rare miracle of Mercy, with the Glory whereof Chriſt did honourably triumph over the ignominy of His croſs, a parallel of which we ſhall hardly find in all the Scripture beſide. Yea, as there be but few at all ſaved, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.16. and moſt ſaved this way: ſo the Lord hath peremptorily threatned to laugh at the Calamity, and not to hear the Cry
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:000977_0033_0FAE8CA85D86BB28"/>
of ſuch as mocked formerly at His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, and would not hear when He called to them: <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24, 26. which Scripture, although it doth not ſhut Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies door upon any who at the hour of Death do ſincerely judge themſelves and flee to Chriſt, as this penitent Thief did: yet it is certain, it implyeth that very few who ſit the offer until then, are honoured with Repentance as he was. And ſo their Cry as not being ſincere and of the right ſtamp, ſhall not be heard.</p>
            <p>The Fourth and moſt Ordinary way, by which many are brought in to Chriſt' is, <hi>By a clear and diſcernable work of the Law and Humiliation, which we ordinarily call,</hi> The Spirit of Bondage, <hi>as was h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nted before.</hi> We do not mean, that every one whoſe Conſcience is awakened with Sin and fear of Wrath, doth really cloſe with Chriſt, the contrary doth appear in <hi>Cain, Saul, Judas &amp;c.</hi> but there is a convicti-of Sin, awakening of Conſcience, and work of Humiliation, which, as we ſhall circumſtantiate it, doth rarely miſcarry or fail of a gracious iſſue, but ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily doth reſolve into the Spirit of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, and a Gracious work of Gods
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:000977_0034_0FAE8CA9488CB0B0"/>
Spirit. And becauſe the Lord dealeth with many Sinners this way, and we find that many are much puzled about the giving judgment of this Law-work.</p>
            <p>This work is either more violent and ſuddenly expede, or it is more ſober and lent, protracted through a greater length of time, and ſo as the ſteps of it are very diſcernable. It is more violent in ſome, as in the Jaylor, <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſome other Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erts in the Book of the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> on whom Chriſt did break in at an inſtant, and fell on them as with fire and ſword and led them Captive terribly. And becauſe ſome great legal ſhakings are deceitful and turn to nothing, if not worſe, we ſhall point at ſome things remarkable in theſe Converts, ſpoken of before, which did prove the work of the Law on them to have had a gracious iſſue and reſult.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Some word of truth or diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, putteth the perſon to a dreadful ſtand, with a great ſtir in the Soul: Some are pricked in heart, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37. ſome fell on trembling, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.29. and this is ſuch a ſtir, that the perſon is brought to his wits end; <hi>What wilt thou have me to do,</hi> faith <hi>Paul</hi>? Act. 9. <hi>What
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:000977_0035_0FAE8CA9AB55EEE0"/>
ſhall I do,</hi> faith the Jaylor? <hi>Act.</hi> 16.30.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly</hi> The perſon is content to have Salvation and Gods Friend-ſhip on any terms; as the Queſtions do import, <hi>What ſhall I do?</hi> As if he had ſaid, What would I not do? What would I not forego? What would I not undergo?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The perſon accepteth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition offered by Chriſt and His Servants, as is clear in the fore-cited Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The perſon preſently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh of one intereſt with the Saints, joyning himſelf with that perſecuted ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, putting reſpect on thoſe, whom he had formerly perſecuted, joyning and continuing with them in the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt on all hazards. Thoſe with whom the Lord hath ſo dealt, have much to ſay for a gracious work of Gods ſpirit in them: and it is like, many of them can date their work from ſuch a particular time and word, or diſpenſation, and can give ſome account of what, paſt between God and them, and of a ſenſible Change following in them from that time forward, as <hi>Paul</hi> giveth a good account of the work and way of God with him afterwards, <hi>Act.</hi> 22.</p>
            <p>Again, the Lord ſometimes carrieth
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:000977_0036_0FAE8D142C0535F8"/>
on this work more calmly, ſoftly and lently, protracting it ſo as the ſeveral ſteps of mens exerciſe under it are very diſcernable. It would draw a great length to enlarge every ſtep of it, we ſhall touch the moſt obſervable things in it.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>It will ordinarily be found, that the Convictions which are in Hypocrites, either are not ſo ſerious, as that ſome other buſineſs will not put them out of head before any ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction be gotten.</hi> As in <hi>Cain,</hi> who went and built a City, and we hear no more of his Convictions, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. <hi>Felix</hi> went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way until a more convenient time, and we hear no more of his Trembling, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.25.

I grant, True Faith in the meaneſt degree, is the gift of God, and above the power of Fleſh and Blood: For, God muſt draw men to Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29. <hi>Job.</hi> 6.44. Yet it were a reflection upon Chriſt, &amp; all He hath done, to ſay, It were a matter of inſuperable difficulty, as is clear, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6, — 11. It were according to that Scripture, as much upon the matter, as to ſay, Chriſt came not from Heaven, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>For the better underſtanding of this, Conſider, That juſtifying Faith, is not to believe that I am Elected, or, to believe that God loveth me, or that Chriſt dyed for me, or the like.

thoſe who are Serious; whileſt Natural Athieſts, and deluded Hypocrites, find no difficulty in aſſerting all thoſe things. I ſay, True juſtifying Faith is not any of the foreſaid things; neither is it ſimply the Believing of any ſentence that is written, or that can be thought upon. I grant, he that believeth or Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, believeth what God hath ſaid about mans Sinful Miſerable condition by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and he believeth that to be true, that there is Life in the Son, who was Slain, and is Riſen again from the Dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But none of theſe, nor the believing of many ſuch Truths, do ſpeak out juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Faith, or that Believing on the Son of God ſpoken of in Scripture: for, then it were ſimply an act of the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But true Juſtifying Faith, which we now ſeek after, as a good mark of an Intereſt in Chriſt, is chiefly and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally an act or work of the heart and will, having preſuppoſed ſundry things about Truth in the underſtanding, with the Heart it is believed unto Salvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10. And although it ſeem (<hi>ver.</hi> 9. of that Chapter) that a man is Saved upon condition that he believe this truth, <hi>GOD Raiſed CHRIST from the Dead</hi>;
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:000977_0060_0FAE8D2FEDBF7CA0"/>
yet we muſt underſtand another thing there, (and <hi>ver.</hi> 10.) than the believing the truth of that Propoſition: For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, all Devils have that Faith whereby they believe that God Raiſed Chriſt from the Dead. So the Scripture hath clearly reſolved Juſtifying Faith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

It goeth out after God ſometimes by an act of waiting when the Soul hath ſomewhat depending be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and hath not got out his mind ſatisfyingly about that thing; then Faith doth wait, and ſo it hath the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>Iſa,</hi> 49.23. Sometimes it acteth in a wilful way upon the Lord, when the Soul apprehendeth God thruſting it away, and threatning its ruine; So <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It were tedious to inſtance all the ſeveral wayes of the

acting of Faith upon, and its exerciſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and outgoings after Chriſt. I may ſay, according to the various conditions and preſſures of the Soul of man, the Lord hath variouſly held out Himſelf, and His Fulneſs in Chriſt under divers notions, as might moſt fitly meet the diſtreſs or condition of Man; and accordingly Faith which God hath appointed to traffick and travel between Chriſt and Man, as the Inſtrument of conveyance of His ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto man, and of maintaining Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Communion, with Him, acteth variouſly and differently upon God in Chriſt: For, Faith is the very ſhaping out of a mans Heart according to Gods device of Salvation by Chriſt Jeſus, in whom it <hi>pleaſed the Father that Fulneſs ſhould dwell.</hi> So that let Chriſt turn what way He will, Faith airteth and pointeth that way. Now, He turneth all wayes in which He can be uſeful to poor man, and therefore Faith acteth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly on Him for drawing out of that fulneſs, according to a mans caſe and condition.</p>
                  <p>As for Example, The Soul is naked, deſtitute of a covering to keep it from the ſtorm of Gods Wrath; Chriſt is fine

Raiment, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17, 18. Then accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, Faith's work here is to put on the Lord Jeſus, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. The Soul is hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry and thirſty after ſomewhat that may Everlaſtingly ſatisfie; Chriſt Jeſus is Milk, Wine, Water, the Bread of Life, and the true Manna, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1, 2. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6 48, 51. He is the Feaſt of fat things, and of wine refined, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.6. Then the work and exerciſe of Faith, is, to go buy, eat and drink abundantly, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.53, 57. The Soul is purſued for Guilt more or leſs &amp; is not Law-biding: Chriſt Jeſus is the City of Refuge and the High-Prieſt there, during whoſe Life-time (that is forever) the poor man, who wins thither, is ſafe. Then the work and exerciſe of Faith is, to flee thither for Refuge, to lay hold on the Hope ſet before us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18. In a word, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever way He may benefit poor man, ſo He ſpeaketh of Himſelf; and as He hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out Himſelf in the Scripture, ſo Faith doth point towards Him. If He be a Bridegroom, Faith will go out in a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage Relation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If He be a Father, Faith pleadeth the man to be a Child; If He be a Shepherd, Faith pleads the man may be one of His Sheep: If He be a Lord,

Faith calleth Him ſo, which none can do but by the Spirit of Jeſus: If He be Dead and Riſen again for our Juſtification, Faith believeth God hath raiſed Him on that account, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9. Whereſoever <hi>He</hi> be, there would <hi>Faith</hi> be; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever <hi>He</hi> is, <hi>Faith</hi> would be ſomewhat proportionally. For, by <hi>Faith</hi> the heart is ſhapen out in breadth &amp; length for Him: Yea, when the fame and report of Him goeth abroad in His Truth, although <hi>Faith</hi> ſee not much, yet it believeth on His Name, upon the very fame He hath ſent abroad of Himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12.</p>
                  <p>But here for avoiding of miſtakes, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt; <hi>That although Juſtifying Faith acteth ſo variouſly, yet every Reliever, who hath a good Title to Jeſus Chriſt, hath not all theſe various actings &amp; exerciſes of Faith; for, his condition craveth them not: and alſo the Maſter is pleaſed not to lead our the Faith of ſome perſons at ſometimes in ſome of theſe wayes,</hi>
                     </hi> (for reaſons known to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) <hi>even when their neceſſity</hi> (to their apprehenſion) <hi>calleth for ſuch acting of Faith.</hi> Surely every one dare not ſay, <hi>Though He kill me, yet will I trust in Him</hi>
                     <pb n="72" facs="unknown:000977_0069_0FAE8D3BF58E05A0"/>
Many would not have gone up with that woman I ſpoke of, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. but would have been diſcouraged and quit the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit. It is on this account that Chriſt doth highly commend the faith of ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the faith of others, <hi>Mat</hi> 8.10. <hi>Mat</hi> 15.28. Many good people are much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted about their Faith, becauſe it go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not out in all thoſe wayes we find recorded in Scripture: But there is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any man will be found, whoſe faith acteth all theſe wayes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly; <hi>Many of theſe actings of Faith are much intended and remitted.</hi>
                     </hi> They are ſometimes Strong and Vigorous, and diſcernable, and ſometimes they fail, and misbelief doth prevail; ſo as it were an uncertain thing to judge of a mans ſtate by theſe.

                  <p>Yet,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly; <hi>Although theſe actings of Faith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ave Promiſes annexed unto them, they are
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:000977_0070_0FAE8D3CAC0F0998"/>
not for that, the condition of the New-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: for then every one behoved to have each one of them, which is not true as we ſaid before.</hi>
                     </hi> A Promiſe is made to him who overcometh, but perſeverence is not the condition of the New-Covenant, but doth ſuppoſe it. There are Promiſes made to the exerciſe of all Graces in Scripture; but only Faith is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Covenant. I ſay then, theſe Promiſes are made to theſe actings of Faith, not as ſuch, but as they do ſuppoſe Juſtifying Faith, which is the Covenant. All theſe are actings of Faith, but not as it is Juſtifying.</p>
                  <p>Therefore,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly; <hi>There is ſomewhat common to all Gracious perſons, which may be ſuppoſed by all the foreſaid actings of Faith, wherein the nature &amp; eſſenſe of Juſtifying Faith ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; and this is the hearts ſatisfaction about Gods device of Salvation by Chriſt; when man pleaſeth Gods invention of ſatisfaction to Juſtice through Jeſus Chriſt, in whom all fulneſs doth dwell now by the Fathers plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; when the Soul and Heart of man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap> in that, then it Believeth unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
                     </hi> As at firſt the Lord made man ſuitable unto the Covenant of Works,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:000977_0071_0FAE8D3DB5EAF698"/>
by Creating him perfect, and ſo putting him in a capacity to perform His Will in that Covenant. So under the New-Covenant, when God giveth the New Heart to man, He ſets the <hi>Idea</hi> and <hi>Stamp</hi> of all His device in the New-Covenant upon the man, ſo as there is a conſonan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to Gods will there: Thus he beareth the Image of the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> CHRIST JESUS on him. This is a great part of the new heart, and is moſt oppoſed to works. Since now the man abſolutely falleth off works, becoming Dead to the Law (as to the point of Juſtification) by the Body of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4. Many perceiving that God hath deviſed a way of ſatisfying Divine juſtice, and recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loſt man by the Incarnation of Chriſt, he thinks this ſo good and ſure a way, that he abſolutely giveth up with the Law, as I ſaid before, and cloſeth with this device: and this is Believing or Faith, very oppoſite to works and all reſting thereupon. This cannot fail to be in all Gracious perſons, in whom many of the actings of Faith are not to be found. This doth clearly ſuppoſe known diſtreſs in a man, without all relief in himſelf; this ſuppoſeth known fulneſs in Chriſt, as
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:000977_0072_0FAE8D3E2C8B1F38"/>
the alone ſufficient relief; this imports a ſort of impropriation: for the heart pleaſing that device, in ſo far ſwayeth towards it. This is a thing clearly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in all the actings of faith, ſpoken of before. He that greedily hungereth, hath this; and he that leaneth, hath this, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is to eſteem Chriſt the Wiſdom and the Power of God to Salvation; ſo is He ſaid to be to all that believe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1, 24 they eſteem that device wiſe and ſure, beſeeming God, and that is to believe. On this account, Chriſt who is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected ſtone to many, is <hi>Precious to them who believe</hi>; a fit ſtone to recover, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie and beautifie the tottering building and fabrick of loſt man, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. The Kingdom of God is like a man finding a treaſure, which with joy he ſelleth all; <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.44. Theſe words hold out the very way of believing, <hi>viz.</hi> Salvation is diſcovered in the Goſpel to be by Chriſt; the heart valueth that invention as ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying. This is to believe on the Son of God lifted up, which is compared with the looking to the Braſen Serpent, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14. It was mans approbation of that device which made it effectual for his healing. So it is here; he that believet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſetteth to his Seal that God is true. True, wherein? In that record He hath born, that God hath provided Life for men, &amp; placed it all in Chriſt 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10, 11. <hi>He that believeth not, maketh God a L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uſtifying Faith in Scripture. This is the believing on Chriſt &amp; on His Name, the receiving of Him and reſting on him for Salvation, in our Catechiſm. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that Jeſus is the CHRIST, that is, the <hi>Anointed One,</hi> whom the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath <hi>Sealed,</hi> &amp; ſet apart, and qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the work of Reconciling Man unto God; and, <hi>he that believeth that Jeſus is the Chriſt, is born of God,</hi> 1 Joh 5.1. <hi>This is to believe with the Heart, that God hath raiſed Chriſt from the Dead.</hi> The man believeth Chriſt Died, and is Raiſed on the account of ſatisfaction for mans Tranſgreſſion; Devils may believe that. Nay, but the man I ſpeak of, <hi>believeth it with his Heart,</hi> (which no Natural man doth, until a new heart be given to him) that is, he cordially pleaſeth, is ſatisfyed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ith, and acquieſeth in this noble inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:000977_0074_0FAE8D441EFCC510"/>
And this Faith laveth out it ſelf now and then in its actings, out-goings and exerciſes, according to all the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant relations, under which Chriſt is held forth in the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Now, I ſay, this Faith is diſcernable, not only in theſe actings many times; a man may know if his heart doth hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger after Chriſt, and flee for refuge to him when purſued, and if he doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelf unto God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But alſo in its very Nature; as it is juſtifying it is diſcernable and may be known. A man may clearly know, if from known diſtreſs in himſelf upon the report and fame of Chriſts fulneſs, his heart doth pleaſe Gods device in the New-Covenant, if if goeth out after Chriſt in that invention, and pleaſeth Him as Lord of the Life of men, terminating and reſting there, and no where elſe, acquieſing in that contrive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with deſire and complacency. This is a diſcernable thing. Therefore I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt men impartially to examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and if they find that their heart is cloſed ſo with that device of Salvation, and is gone out after Him as precious, that thereupon they conclude a ſure and true intereſt in Chriſt Jeſus, and a go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Firſt; <hi>Remember, that there is a very large allowance in the Covenant promiſed to His people, which maketh things more eaſie.</hi> The Lord hath engaged to take away the ſtony heart, to give a heart of fleſh, a new heart, an heart to fear him for ever; He hath engaged to put his Law in mens heart, to put his Fear in their heart, to make them keep that Law; to put his Spirit in them to cauſe them to keep it. He hath promiſed to ſatisfie the Prieſts with ſatneſs, that the Souls of the people may be ſatiated with goodneſs, and to keep and water them continually eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment. <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> 36.26. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. <hi>Jer</hi> 34

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>For the ſatisfaction of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, I grant this new Creature, as we have circumſcribed and enlarged, it will not be found in all the degrees of it, in every Gracious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> But it is well; if</p>

Yet in anſwer to the Object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, if it be ſeriouſly propoſed, we ſay, the Saints are found in Scripture juſtly laying claim unto God and His Covenant, when iniquity did prevail over them, as we find, Pſal. 65.3. <hi>Iniquities prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me; as for our tranſgreſſions, thou wilt do them away.</hi> Rom. 7.25 <hi>Paul</hi> thanks God through Chriſt, when a law in his members leads him Captive unto ſin: But for the better underſtanding and ſafe application of ſuch Truths, we muſt difference between groſs out-breakings and ordinary infirmities or heart ills, or ſins that come unawares upon a man, without forethought or deliberation.

for the former fort, it is hard for a man whileſt he is under the power of them, to ſee his gracious change, although it be in him, and very hard to draw any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from it, until the man be in ſome meaſure recovered, and begin ſeriouſly to reſent ſuch ſins, and to reſolve againſt them. We find <hi>David</hi> calling himſelf Gods ſervant, quickly after his numbering of Gods People, but he was then under the ſerious reſentment of his ſin, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.10, <hi>Jonab</hi> layeth claim to God as his Maſter under his rebellion, but he is then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We ſhall draw out ſome things from that ſeventh Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> whereupon <hi>Paul</hi> maintains his intereſt in Chriſt, and if you can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them, it is well. (1) When <hi>Paul</hi> findeth that he doth much fail, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach conformity to Gods Law, he doth not blame the Law as being too ſtrict ſo as men can't keep it, as hypocrites uſe to ſpeak; but he doth blame himſelf as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cannot &amp; he faith of the Law, that it is good, holy and ſpiritual, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.12, 14</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="105" facs="unknown:000977_0102_0FAE8CAEA1AD8560"/>2. He can ſay, he failed of a good which he intended, and did out-ſhoot himſelf, and he had often honeſtly reſolved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the evil which he fell into, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.15, 18, 19. (3) He ſaith that the prevailing of ſin over him is his exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, ſo as he judgeth himſelf wretched becauſe of ſuch a body of Death, from which he longeth to be delivered, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. (4) He ſaith, that whileſt he is under the power and law of Sin, there is ſomewhat in the bottom of his heart oppoſing it, although overmaſtered by it, which would be another way, and when that gets the upper hand, it is a delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome thing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.22, 25. Upon theſe things he thanks God in Chriſt that there is no Condemnation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.25. Now, then look if ye can lay claim to theſe things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> If you do blame your ſelf, and approve the Law, whileſt you fail.</p>

                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly.</hi> If you can ſay, that there is a party within you oppoſing theſe evils, which would be at the right way, and, as it were, is in its element, when it is in Gods way, it is well; only be adviſed not to take reſt until in ſome meaſure, you be rid of the ground of this objection, or at leaſt, until you can very clearly ſay, you are waging War with theſe things: Now a good help againſt the prevailing power of Sin, is to cleave cloſe to Chriſt Jeſus by Faith, which as it is a deſirable part of Sanctification, and a notable piece of Conformity to Gods will, and moſt ſubſervient unto His deſign in the Goſpel, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20, 21. and ſo ſhould be much endeavoured by People, as a work pleaſing unto God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.29.

                  <p>I ſhall ſhortly hint ſome of theſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Communications, and I hope upon a right diſcovery of them there will be but ſmall ground found for the jealous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of many Gracious people.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, (Beſide theſe Convictions of the Spirit of God, which uſe to uſher Chriſts way unto the Souls of men, and theſe alſo which afterwards do ordinarily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them) <hi>There is a Seal of the Spirit of God ſpoken of in Scripture</hi>; the principal thing whereof is the Sanctifying work of the holy Ghoſt, imprinting the draughts and lineaments of Gods Image and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will upon a man, as a ſeal or ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net doth leave an impreſſion and ſtamp of its likeneſs upon the thing Sealed, ſo it is, 2 Tim. 2.19. <hi>The foundation of God — having this Seal; the Lord knoweth them who are His. And let every one that nameth the Name of Chriſt, depart from iniquity.</hi> And thus I conceive the ſeal to be called a witneſs, 1 Joh. 5 10. <hi>He that believeth hath the witneſs in himſelf</hi>; that is, the
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:000977_0105_0FAE8CB36DDF83D8"/>
grounds upon which an intereſt in Chriſt is to be made out, and proved, are in every Believer; for he hath ſomewhat of the ſanctifying work of Gods Spirit in him, which is a ſure (although not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes a clear and manifeſt) witneſs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>There is Communion with God much talked of among Chriſtians, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they underſtand the ſenſible preſenſe of God refreſhing the Soul exceedingly.</hi> But if we ſpeak properly, Communion with God is a mutual intereſt between God and a man, who hath cloſed with him in Chriſt. It is a common-neſs or a common intereſt between God and a Man; not only is a man intereſted in God Himſelf, but in all that is the Lords: ſo the Lord hath a ſpecial intereſt in the man, and alſo all that belongs to him. There is a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion between Husband and Wife, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they have a ſpecial intereſt in others, perſons, goods, gear and concernments, ſo it is here; there is ſuch a Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God. He is our God, and all things are ours, becauſe He is ours: this Communion with God all true Believers have at all times, as we ſhall ſhew after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: I grant there is an actual im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:000977_0106_0FAE8CB42EA54CA8"/>
of that Communion, whereby men do boldly meddle with any thing that belongs unto God, and do meddle with Himſelf as their own, with much homelineſs and familiarity, eſpecially in Worſhip, when the Soul doth converſe with a living God, partaking of the Divine Nature, growing like unto Him, and ſweetly travelling through his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, and with ſome confidence of intereſt, viewing theſe things as the mans own goods and gear: this we call Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God in Ordinances: This indeed is not ſo ordinarily nor frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made out to men, and all Gods Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do not equally partake of it; and it is true, that what is in God, goeth not out for the behove of the man, to his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion equally at all times, yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Communion with God, properly ſo called, <hi>viz.</hi> that common-neſs of <hi>Intereſt</hi> between God and a Man who is ſavingly in Covenant with Him, doth alwayes ſtand firm and ſure; and ſo much of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God in Ordinances have all Believers, as that their heart converſeth with a living God there now and then, and is in ſome meaſure changed into that ſame image, and there needs be no doubt about any further in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="110" facs="unknown:000977_0107_0FAE8CB55D846580"/>Thirdly, <hi>There is a thing which is called Fell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>wſhip with God, often miſtaken alſo amongſt Believers.</hi> If by fellowſhip be meant the walking in our duty as in the ſight of a living God, who ſeeth and heareth us, and is witneſs to all our carriage. It is a thing common unto all gracious men, they all have it habitually, and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, Pſal. 16.8. <hi>I have ſet the Lord al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes before me</hi>; yea, and often they have it actually in exerciſe, when their ſpirit is in any good frame; they walk as if they ſaw God ſtanding by them, and have ſome thoughts of His favour through Chriſt; <hi>Truly our fellowſhip is with the Father and with His Son,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3. If we by <hi>Fellowſhip,</hi> do mean a ſweet, refreſhing, familiar, ſenſible converſing with God, which doth delight and refreſh the Soul, (beſide what the Conſcience of Duty doth) it is then a walking in the light of His Countenance, and a good part of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible preſence; and although it ſeemeth <hi>Enoch</hi> had much of it, whileſt it is ſaid, <hi>He walked with God, Gen.</hi> 5.24. yet it is not ſo ordinary as the former, nor ſo common to all Chriſtians, for here the Soul is filled as with marrow and fatneſs,
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:000977_0108_0FAE8CB5AA2D41A8"/>
following hard after its guide, and ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly upheld by his right hand, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.5, 8.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>There is a thing which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Acceſs unto God:</hi> and this I take to be the removing of obſtructions out of the way between a man and God, ſo as the man is admitted to come near. We are ſaid to have acceſs to a great perſon, when doors are caſt open, guards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from about him, and we admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to cloſe at him; ſo it is here. Now this Acceſs in Scripture, is ſometimes taken for Chriſts preparing of the way, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of enmity between God and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; ſo as men now have a patent way to come unto God through Chriſt, <hi>Eph,</hi> 2.18. Sometimes it is taken for the actual improvement of that Ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eſs pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by Chriſt, when a man finds all <hi>obstructions</hi> and <hi>differences,</hi> which do or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily fall in between him and God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; God is not uncouth to him, nor as a ſtranger, keeping up himſelf from him, or frowning on him, but the man is admitted to come even to his ſeat, as <hi>Job</hi> 23.3. Of the want of this doth <hi>Job</hi> complain, <hi>Job</hi> 23.8, 9 whilſt he ſaith, I go forward, backward, to the right and
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:000977_0109_0FAE8CB815CCDB38"/>
left hand, &amp; I find him not. The <hi>first</hi> ſort of Acceſs is common to all Believers, they are brought near by the Blood of the Covenant, and are no more far off, as the deadly enmity between God and them is removed. But Acceſs, in the other ſenſe, is diſpenſed more, according to the Lords abſolute ſoveraignty and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and it is left in the power of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers to obſtruct it unto themſelves, until it pleaſe the Lord mercifully and freely to grant unto them again, ſo it is up and down, and there needs be no queſtion, as to a mans ſtate) about it.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>There is a thing called Liberty before God, and this properly is freedom, or free ſpeaking unto God.</hi> Many do much queſtion their ſtate, becauſe of the want of this now and then, ſince the Scripture hath ſaid, <hi>Where the Spirit is, there is Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17. but they do juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine that liberty ſpoken of there, unto this free ſpeaking before God. I grant where the ſpirit of the Lord doth ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly diſcover Gods will in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to a man, there is liberty from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny obligation to the Ceremonial-Law, and from the Condemning power of the
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:000977_0110_0FAE8CB9022A5DF8"/>
Moral-Law, and from much of that groſs Darkneſs and Ignorance, which is on Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural hearts as a vail hiding Chriſt in the Goſpel from them. I grant alſo, that ſometimes, even this liberty which is a free communing with God, and ordering of our cauſe before him, and filling of our mouths with arguments, <hi>Job</hi> 23.4. is granted to the Godly, but not as liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty taken in the former ſenſes. Although the Lord hath obliged Himſelf to pour out the Spirit of Prayer upon all the houſe of <hi>David</hi> in ſome meaſure, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. yet this Communication of the Spirit, which we call liberty or free ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto God, dependeth much on the Lords abſolute pleaſure, when, and in what meaſure to allow it. This liberty which we call freedom, or free ſpeaking with God in Prayer, is ſometimes much abſtracted from any great confidence in the time of Prayer, (<hi>at leaſt until it draw toward the cloſe of it</hi>) it ſtandeth much in a vivacity of the underſtanding to take up the caſe which a man is to ſpeak be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, ſo as he can order his cauſe; and next, there be words, or verbal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, elegant, ſuitable, and very emphatical or powerful, or pithy; there
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:000977_0111_0FAE8CB96C8B1380"/>
is alſo joyned a fervency of Spirit in Prayer whereof the Scripture ſpeaketh; <hi>The Soul is hot and bended and very intent</hi>: there is alſo ordinarily in this liberty a ſpec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>al melting of the heart (<hi>often joined with a great meaſure of the Spirit of Grace &amp; Supplication, Zech.</hi> 11.10) ſo the Soul is poured out before God as for a <hi>Firſt-born</hi>: ſuch is the liberty which many Saints get before God, whileſt in much broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Heart and fervency of ſpirit they are admitted to ſpeak their mind fully to God, as a living God, noticing (<hi>at leaſt</hi>) their Prayer. Sometimes this liberty is joyned with Confidence, and then it is not only a free, but alſo a bold ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before God: <hi>It is that Boldneſs with Confidence, Eph.</hi> 3.12. This is more rarely imparted unto men then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, yet it is ordinarily. It hath in it, beſide what we ſpake before, ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the Spirit upon Faith, making it put out ſome vigorous acting in Prayer; there is a ſweet mournful frame of Spirit, by which a man poureth out his heart in Gods boſome, and with ſome confidence of His favour and good-will, pleadeth his cauſe before him, as a Living God; and this is all the ſenſible preſence that
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:000977_0112_0FAE8CBA7B5EC2D0"/>
many Sains do attain unto: There is no ground of doubt about a mans ſtate in the point of Liberty before God in this laſt ſenſe, becauſe there is nothing eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the making up of a Gracious ſtate here: ſome have it, ſome want it, ſome have it at ſome times and not at other times, ſo that it is much up and down; yet I may ſay, Gracious men may do much (by a very ordinary influence) contributing towards the attaining and retaining, or keeping of ſuch a frame of Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>There is a thing called, Influence or Breathing of the Spirit.</hi> This gracious influence (for of ſuch only do I now ſpeak) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> either ordinary, and this is the operation of the Holy Spirit on the Soul and the habits of Grace there, whereby they are ſtill kept alive and in ſome exerciſe and acting, although not very diſcernable. This influence (<hi>I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)</hi> doth alwayes attend Believers, &amp; is that <hi>Keeping</hi> and <hi>Watering</hi> night and day, and every moment, promiſed. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.3. Or, this influence is more ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and ſpecial, and is that ſame to a gracious (although a withered) Soul, as the wind and breath to the dry Bones,
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:000977_0113_0FAE8CBB2D9A4D18"/>
putting them in good caſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.9, 10. and as the dew or rain to the Graſs, or newly mowen field &amp; parched ground, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.6 Such influence is meant, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.16 By the blowing of the <hi>South</hi> wind, making the ſpices to flow out. When the Spirit moveth thus, there is an edge put upon the Graces of God in the Soul, and they are made to act more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly. This is the enlarging of the heart, by which a man doth run in the wayes of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.32. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence is more diſcernable than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and not ſo ordinarily communicated. Alſo here, ſometimes the wind bloweth more upon one Grace, and ſometimes more diſcernable upon another; and often upon many of the Graces together, and according to the leſſer or greater meaſure of this influence, the Soul acteth more or leſs vigorouſly towards God: and ſince faith is a Created Grace in the Soul this <hi>Influence</hi> of the Spirit is upon it, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times leſs, ſometimes more, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly is the aſſurance of Faith ſmall or great.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>There is the hearing of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, often ſpoken of in Scripture; and many vex themſelves about it, alleging that they
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:000977_0114_0FAE8CBBB1563FC0"/>
know nothing of it experimentally.</hi> I grant there is a favourable hearing of Prayer: But we muſt remember it is twofold.</p>
                  <p>Either;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>It is ſuch as a man is ſimply to believe by way of Argument on Scriptural grounds.</hi> As if I be fled unto Chriſt, and do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto God in him, pray accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to His Will, not regarding iniquity in my heart, exerciſing Faith about the thing I pray for, abſolutely or conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally, according to the nature of the thing and promiſes about it. I am ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to believe that God heareth my Prayer and will give what is good, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to theſe Scriptures, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.13, 14. <hi>Whatſoever you ask in my Name, I will do it,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.14. This is our confidence that whatſoever we ask according to His Will, He heareth us, <hi>Mark,</hi> 11.24. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that you receive and you ſhall have what you do deſire, Pſal. 66.18. <hi>If I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard Iniquity, He will not hear.</hi> Then if I regard not Iniquity, I may believe that He doth hear me.

Her countenance was no more ſad. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Lord did breath upon her Faith, and made her believe that ſhe was heard, and ſhe could not make it out by any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument; for ſhe had not grounds where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to build the premiſes of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment according to Scripture in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. God did ſtamp in ſome way up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her heart ſenſibly, and ſo made her believe it. This is but rarely granted, eſpecially in caſes clearly deducible in Scripture. And therefore people are much to be ſatisfied in exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing their Faith about the other, and let God give of this latter what He plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.

It is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18, 19. that by loving the Brethren in deed and in truth, we may aſſure our hearts before God; and that a man may rejoyce upon the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of a good Conſcience, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12 A man may have confidence if his heart do not Condemn him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.21 We may then attain unto ſome Aſſurance (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not full Aſſurance) by the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our own ſpirits. I do not deny, that in this witneſſing of our ſpirits to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Aſſurance, there is ſome concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Spirit of God: But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, there needeth but a very ordinary influence, without which we can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Now, this Aſſurance, ſuch as it is, may be reached by intelligent Believers, who keep a good Conſcience in their walk. So, I hope, there needs be no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate about it, as to a mans gracious ſtate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> for if a man will clear himſelf of Heart-condemnings, he will ſpeedily reach this Aſſurance.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, <hi>There is a witneſſing of Gods ſpirit, mentioned,</hi> Rom. 8.16. <hi>A bearing
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:000977_0117_0FAE8CBFAF4929E0"/>
witneſs with our Spirits, that we are the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God.</hi> This operation of the Spirit, is beſt underſtood,, if we produce any ſyllogiſm by which our ſpirit do witneſs our Son-ſhip: As for example, Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever loveth the Brethren, is paſt from Death to Life, and conſequently is in Chriſt; <hi>But I love the Brethren: Therefore I am paſt from Death to Life.</hi> Here there is a threefold operation of the Spirit, or three operations rather. The <hi>First</hi> is a beam of Divine light upon the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, perſwading the Divine authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it, as the Word of God: The Spirit of the Lord muſt witneſs the Divinity of the Scripture; and that is the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Word of God, far beyond all other arguments can be uſed. The <hi>Second</hi> operation is, a Glorious beam of light from the Spirit, ſhining upon the ſecond propoſition, and ſo upon his own graces in the Soul, diſcovering them to be true Graces, and ſuch as the Scripture calleth ſo. Thus we are ſaid to know by His Spirit the things freely given unto us of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.13. The <hi>Third</hi> operation is in order to the third propoſition of the argument, or the concluſion; and this I conceive to be nothing elſe but
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:000977_0118_0FAE8CC0ADCCFDA8"/>
an influence upon Faith, ſtrengthning it to draw a concluſion of full aſſurance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the foreſaid premiſes. Now (with ſubmiſſion unto others, who have greater light in the Scripture, and more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of theſe communications) I do conceive the witneſs of the Spirit, or witneſſing of it, which is mentioned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. is not that firſt operation upon the firſt propoſition; for, that ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is that teſtimony of the Spirit, by which He beareth witneſs to the Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the whole Scripture, and aſſerteth the Divine authority of it unto the ſouls of Gracious men, and ſuch an operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be upon a truth of Scripture, which doth not relate to a mans Son-ſhip or Intereſt in Chriſt at all. The Spirit may ſo ſhine upon any truth, relating to Duty, or any other fundamental truth perſwading the Divinity of it, upon and unto the ſoul, and ſpeak nothing relating to a mans intereſt in Chriſt. Neither is the third operation of the Spirit, by which He makes Faith boldly draw the concluſion. This witneſſing of the Spirit for that operation, is nothing elſe but <hi>influence</hi> upon Faith, bringing it out to full aſſurance; but that whereupon this
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:000977_0119_0FAE8CC0EFA30D98"/>
full aſſurance is drawn or put out, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what depoſed and witneſſed already. Therefore I conceive the ſecond opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit upon the ſecond pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and ſo upon the Graces in the man, is that witneſs of Gods Spirit, that beam of Divine light, ſhining upon thoſe Graces, whereby they are made very conſpicuous to the underſtanding: That is the witneſs; the ſhining ſo on them is His witneſſing: for, only here in this propoſition and in this operation, doth the Spirit of God prove a co-witneſs with our ſpirit: for, the main thing wherein the witneſs of our ſpirit lieth, is in the ſecond propoſition, and ſo the Spirit of God, witneſſing with our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, is alſo in that ſame propoſition. So theſe two witneſſes, having depoſed and witneſſed one and the ſame thing, <hi>viz.</hi> the truth and reality of ſuch and ſuch Graces in the man, which our own ſpirit or conſcience doth depoſe, according to its knowledge; and the Spirit of the Lord doth certainly affirm and witneſs to be ſo. There is a ſentence drawn forth, and a concluſion of the mans Son-ſhip by the mans Faith, breathed upon by the <hi>Spirit</hi> for that effect, and this concluſion
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:000977_0120_0FAE8CC1DC632E70"/>
beareth the full aſſurance of a mans Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. It may be preſumed, that ſome true Saints do not partake of this all their dayes, as <hi>Heb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Tenthly, <hi>I ſpeak with the experience of many Saints, and I hope, according to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if I ſay, there is a communication of the Spirit of God which is let out to ſome of His People; ſometimes it is ſomewhat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, if not beyond, that witneſſing of a Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſpoken of before: It is a Glorious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine manifestation of God unto the Soul, ſhedding abroad Gods love in the Heart; it is a thing better felt then ſpoken of; it is no audible voice, but it is a waffe of Glory filling the Soul with God, as He is Life, Light, Love and Liberty, countervasting that audible voice</hi>; O Man, greatly Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.22. <hi>putting a man in a tranſport with this in his heart,</hi> It is good to be here, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 17, 4 It is that which went out from Chriſt to <hi>Mary,</hi> when He but mentioned her name, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.16 He had ſpoken ſome words to her before, and ſhe underſtood not that it was He: But when He uttered this one word <hi>MARY,</hi> there was ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable conveyance and manifeſtation
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:000977_0121_0FAE8CC2C7A805A0"/>
made out unto her heart, by which ſhe was ſo ſatisfyingly filled, that there was no place for arguing &amp; diſputing, whether or not that was Chriſt, and if ſhe had a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> intereſt in Him. That manifeſtation made Faith to it ſelf, and did purchaſe credit and truſt to it ſelf, and was equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent with, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord.</hi> This is ſuch a glanſe of Glory, that it may in the higheſt ſenſe be called, the earneſt or firſt fruits of the inheritance: for, it is a felt armful of the Holy GOD, almoſt wholly conforming the man unto His likeneſs, ſo ſwallowing him up, that He forgetteth all things except the preſent manifeſtation. Oh, How Glorious is this manifeſtation of the Spirit! Faith here riſeth to ſo full an aſſurance, that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolveth wholly into ſenſible embracements of God. This is the thing which doth beſt deſerve the title of ſenſible preſence. And, it is like, is not given unto all Believers, ſome whereof, are all their Dayes under bondage, and in fear, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.15 But here love, almoſt perfect, caſteth out fear. This is ſo abſolutely let out upon the Maſters pleaſure, and ſo tranſient and paſſing or quickly gone when it is, that no man may bring his
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:000977_0122_0FAE8CC32A451738"/>
Gracious ſtate upon debate for want of it.</p>
                  <p>Eleventhly, <hi>There is a thing we call Peace, about which many do vex themſelves.</hi> This Peace is either about a mans ſtate, that he is reconciled unto God by Jeſus Chriſt, or it is about his preſent caſe and condition, thas he is walking ſo, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proven of God, at leaſt ſo far, as there is no quarrel or controverſie between God and him threatning a ſtroke: both of theſe are either ſuch in the court of Scripture, and conſequently in Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, or in the court of a mans Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Peace about a mans ſtate, as being in Chriſt, is ſure in the Court of Scripture and of Heaven, when a man doth by Faith cloſe with Chriſt and New-Covenant, Rom. 5.1. <hi>Being juſtifyed by Faith, we have Peace with God</hi>; it being ſure and ſolid in the Court of Scripture, it ſhould <hi>hold</hi> ſure in the Court of a mans Conſcience, it being rightly inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for in that caſe, it ſtill ſpeaks ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Scripture: but becauſe often the Conſcience is misinformed and in the dark, therefore there is often Peace about a mans ſtate according to Scripture, whileſt his Conſcience doth threaten the
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:000977_0123_0FAE8CC3ECD35F50"/>
contrary, and doth ſtill Condemn, and refuſeth to aſſoil the man, as being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled unto God through Chriſt. In this caſe, the Conſcience muſt be inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the mans Gracious ſtate made out by the marks of Grace, as we ſhew before; and here the witneſs of my own ſpirit, will do much to allay the Cry of the Conſcience, and if the Spirit of the Lord joyn His witneſs and teſtimony, the Conſcience is perfectly ſatisfied, and proclameth Peace to the man. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Peace, about a mans preſent caſe or condition, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is approven of God in a Goſpel ſenſe, it may be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and juſtly wanting, although the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Peace about a mans ſtate be ſure. This Peace about a mans caſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, it is either ſuch in the Court of Scripture, and this is when a man is not regarding iniquity, and reſpecting the Commands of God without exception; then the Scripture ſaith, he ſtands in an even place, and he needeth fear no ſtated quarrel between God and him, in order to a temporary ſtroak; and when it is thus, his Conſcience ſhould alſo aſſoil him that ſame way; and would do ſo, if it were rightly informed; but becauſe
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:000977_0124_0FAE8CC4C5DAC398"/>
the Conſcience is often in the dark, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a man may be alarm'd with evil in the Court of Conſcience, as if he were juſtly to expect a ſtroak from God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his ſin, and ſome quarrel God hath at him, although He intend ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for him; this is enough to keep a man in disquiet, and to inhibit him the rejoycing allowed upon him, whileſt he is walking in his integrity: therefore a man muſt here alſo inform his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and receive no accuſations nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnings from it, unleſs it make them clear by <hi>Scripture:</hi> at that bar, let every man ſtand, both about his ſtate and his condition or caſe; and let him appeal from all other Courts to that, and not receive any indictment but conform to the truth of God, by which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is to proceed in all things; and if this were well lookt unto, there would not be ſo many groundleſs ſuſpicions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Lords People, either about their ſtate or their condition upon every thought which entertain their mind.</p>
                  <p>Twelfthly, <hi>There is the joy of the Holy Ghoſt, and this is when the Spirit doth breath upon our rejoycing in God</hi> (<hi>which is a Grace
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:000977_0125_0FAE8CC5C1CA8EA0"/>
very little in exerciſe with many</hi>) <hi>and maketh it ſet out ſenſibly and vigorouſly; &amp; He exciteth and ſtirreth the paſſion of joy and of delight in the Soul, ſo as there is an unſpeakable and glorious joy in the Soul, in the apprehenſion of Gods friendſhip and near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto him.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. This joy followeth upon peace &amp; peace followeth righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. This joy readily will not fail to be according to the meaſure of the aſſurance of Faith, as 1 Pet. 1.8 <hi>In whom believing, ye rejoyce, &amp;c.</hi> ſo that the removal of miſtakes about other things, will allay doubts about this.</p>
                  <p>Now, becauſe ſome of theſe excellent communications of the Spirit, after they are gone, are brought in queſtion as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions of Satan, for vindicating of them we ſay, that the ſpecial operations of Gods Spirit in any high degree, uſually are communicated to people after ſuch brokenneſs of ſpirit, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.8. after ſo ſingular pains in religious Duty, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.3, 21 or in time of ſuch ſuffering for Righteouſneſs, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.14. or if they break in as the rain that waiteth not for man, then they do ſo humble and abaſe the perſon, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.5. and there are found

ſo many evidences of Grace in the man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. or theſe things do ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke unto Holineſs, and to have every thing anſwerable and conform unto theſe manifeſtations of God, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. the perſon under them doth ſo loath all things beſide Gods friendſhip and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.4. and theſe things do carry on them and with them ſo much authority, and Divine ſuperſcription, whilſt they are in the ſoul; that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they may appear ſufficiently to be ſpecial communications of God, and ſingular, gracious operations of His <hi>Spirit,</hi> and no deluſions of <hi>Satan</hi> transforming himſelf into an Angel of light, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11 14. nor ſuch common flaſhes of the <hi>Spirit</hi> as may admit afterwards irrecoverable Apoſtacy from God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5, 6. Now then to conclude this part of the work that relateth unto tryal; I ſay to all theſe who complain of the want of the precious out-lettings of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Bleſs God if you want nothing eſſential for making out of a ſaving intereſt in Chriſt.</hi> God hath given unto you Chriſt Jeſus, the greateſt gift He had, and ſince your heart is ſhapen out for Him, He will

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Remember the Promiſes of Life, and of Peace with God, are no where in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture made unto theſe ſpecial things whereof you alledge the want</hi>: The Promiſes are made unto Faith, followed with Holineſs! and it may be preſumed, that many Heirs of Glory do not in this life par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of ſome of theſe things, but are in Bondage all their dayes through fear of Death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.15. ſo that there ſhould be no miſtake about theſe things: we may ſeek after them, but God is free to give or withold them.</p>

It is to no value and highly eſteem of Chriſt Jeſus as the treaſure ſufficient to enrich poor man, and with the heart to believe this record, that there is Life enough in him for men. It is to pleaſe this invention, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſe in it as the only way to true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:000977_0137_0FAE8CD2795F5120"/>
It is to point towards this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, as God holdeth Him our in the Goſpel, with deſire to lay the ſtreſs of our whole ſtate on him. This is that which is called faith or believing, the receiving of Chriſt, or believing on His Name, <hi>Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> 1 12. This is that believing on the Name of the Lord Jeſus, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded unto the Jaylor for his ſafety, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.31 This agreeth to all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of juſtifying Faith in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This doth anſwer the type of look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the brazen Serpent lifted up in the Wilderneſs, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14. And this is ſuppoſed in all theſe ordinary actings of Faith, to which promiſes are annexed in the Scripture, and will be found in all who have got the new heart from God, and it will be found in none elſe.</p>
            <p>As to the Second thing, viz. <hi>That this is the neceſſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>It appeareth thus;</p>
            <p n="1">1. This cloſing with Gods device, or believing in Chriſt, is commanded every where in Scripture by the Lord, as the condition of the New-Covenant, giving title and right unto all the Spiritual bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the ſame; for, it is upon the
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:000977_0138_0FAE8CD36A9444C0"/>
matter, the receiving of Chriſt: this is commanded, whilſt God bids men come and buy, that is, impropriate all, by clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with that device. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1 The weary are commanded to come unto him thus for their reſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. <hi>This is His Commandment, that we believe on the Name of His Son,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.23. This is enough to prove it a duty incumbent. But further, it is ſuch a duty as only giveth title and right to a Son-ſhip; for only they who receive Him, are privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be Sons, Joh. 1.12. <hi>To as many as received him, to them he gave power to be the Sons of God, even to ſuch as believed on his Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 It appeareth to be the neceſſary duty of all, thus; No leſs than this doth give a meeting unto God, offering Himſelf to be our God in Chriſt; and no leſs than this doth anſwer our profeſſion, as we are in Covenant with Him, as members of his viſible Church. The Lord offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be our God in Chriſt; if we do not cloſe with the offer, laying aſide all thoughts of otherwayes, by which we may attain to happineſs, we give no meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him: He ſaith, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed, hear ye

               </gap> be ſuppoſed in theſe who live under Goſpel-ordinances; As the knowledge that men have immortal Souls, Soul and Body will be united again at the laſt Day; there is a Heaven and Hell, one of which will be the everlaſting lot of all men: the Old and New Teſtament is the true Word of God, and the rule of
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:000977_0143_0FAE8CD777553110"/>
Faith and Manners, every man is by Nature void of the Grace of God, and is an Enemy unto God, and an Heir of Condemnation; Reconciliation is only by the Mediator Chriſt Jeſus; Faith unites unto Him, and is the condition of the New Covenant; Holineſs is the fruit of true Faith, and is to be ſtudied as that without which no man ſhall ſee God: I ſay beſide theſe things, the knowledge of which is neceſſary;</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is required of him who would believe on Chriſt Jeſus, That he take to heart his Natural condition. And here he muſt know ſomethings, and alſo be very ſerious about them: I ſay, he muſt know ſome things; As,</p>
            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="2">2. The man muſt know, that the Wrath of God denounced in Scripture,

refuge ſomewhere. I grant ſome have a higher and ſome a leſſer degree of this ſeriouſneſs, as we ſhew in the former part of this Treatiſe. But if we ſpeak of the Lords ordinary way of working with thoſe who are come to age, we ſay, they muſt very ſeriouſly take their Souls eſtate to heart, deſpairing of help in themſelves: ſince the whole need no Phyſician, but thoſe who are ſick, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.12.

            <p>The third thing pre-required, is, a man muſt know that as God hath not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded him from the relief appointed, ſo he is willing to be reconciled unto men through <hi>Christ,</hi> and hath obliged men to cloſe with Him through <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and ſo to impropriate that Salvation to themſelves. He not only invites all to come, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.1, and welcometh all that come, as we find in the Goſpel, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth thoſe who come, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.10. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.28. and chideth for not coming and cloſing with him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.40. and condemneth for not cloſing ſo with him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18. But alſo he commandeth all to believe on Chriſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.23. So as a man is not to queſtion the Lords willingneſs to receive men, who go to
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:000977_0150_0FAE8CDDD21EF250"/>
Chriſt honeſtly; for God hath abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cleared that in Scripture: unleſs that a man know ſo much, he will ſcarcely dare to lay his heart open for that noble device of ſaving ſinners, or adventure his own weight and ſtreſs upon <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth thing pre-required, is, The man who would cloſe with <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> muſt reſolve to break all Covenants with Hell and Death: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.15. Whatſoever known evil men are engaged into, they muſt reſolve to forego it: for there is no concord between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Belial.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14, — The Lord requireth that they who would expect Him to be for them, ſhould not be for another, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.3 This is far from Evangelick repentance, which I grant doth not precede a mans cloſing with CHRIST by Faith; there is little here beyond a miſregard of theſe things unto which a man was formerly devoted, and a ſlighting what he was mad upon, becauſe he ſeeth himſelf deſtroyed thereby, and relief now offered, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon his heart beginneth to be more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent than formerly it was. After this, when Chriſt is lookt upon alone, His worth and beauty doth appear, ſo as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:000977_0151_0FAE8CDEF9457BD8"/>
all the gods there is none like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to HIM, and he looketh out as a ſufficient covering of the Eyes to all who get him. Upon which the heart loveth Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in the New-Covenant, and loveth to lay its weight upon Chriſt rather than any other way, bending towards him, and ſo the man becometh a Believer. Now, I will not ſay that all theſe things whereof we have ſpoken, are formally, orderly and diſtinctly found in every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon before he cloſe with God in Chriſt; for the way of the heart with Chriſt, may be added to the four wonderful things, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.19. It is hard to trace the heart in its relelation from Darkneſs to Light; yet we hold out the moſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and likely way, to him who doth ask the way, debarring thereby ignorant and ſenſeleſs perſons from medling; &amp; diſcharging them to pretend to any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Him whileſt they remain ſuch.</p>
            <p>The Fourth thing we propoſed to ſpeak to, is, <hi>The properties of this Duty when rightly gone about.</hi> I ſhall only hint a few.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Believing on Chriſt muſt be Perſonal.</hi> A man himſelf, and in his own proper
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:000977_0152_0FAE8CDFAC1DA3E0"/>
perſon muſt cloſe with Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>The Just ſhall live by</hi> His <hi>Faith, Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> 2.4. This ſaith, that it will no ſuffice for a mans ſafety and relief, that he is in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God, as a born Member of the viſible Church, by vertue of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ſubjection to Gods Ordinances. Neither will it ſuffice that the Perſon had the initiating S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l of baptiſm added, and that he then virtually engaged to ſeek Salvation by Chriſts blood, as all infants do Neither doth it ſuffice, that men are come of believing Parents; their Faith will not inſtate their Children into a right to the Spiritual bleſſings of the Covenant. Neither will it ſuffice that Parents did in ſome reſpect engage for their Children, and give them away unto God: all theſe things do not avail. The Children of the Kingdom and of Godly Predeceſſors are caſt out; unleſs a man in his own perſon put out Faith in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and with his own heart pleaſe and acquieſe in that device of ſaving Sinners, he cannot be Saved. I grant this Faith is given unto him by <hi>Christ,</hi> but certain it is, that it muſt be Perſonal.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>This Duty muſt be</hi> Cordial <hi>and</hi> Hearty. <hi>With the heart man believeth unto Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:000977_0153_0FAE8CE06A470B38"/>
Rom.</hi> 10.10. A man muſt be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and without guile in cloſing with Chriſt, judging Him the only covering of the Eyes, not hanckering after another way. The matter muſt not ſwim only in the head, or underſtanding; but it muſt be in the heart: the man not only muſt be perſwaded that <hi>CHRIST</hi> is the way, but affectionately perſwaded of it, loving and liking the thing, having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency in it; ſo that it is a mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh of the Covenant, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. If a man be cordial and affectionate in any thing, ſurely he muſt be ſo here in this one thing that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. It muſt not be ſimply a fancy in the head, but it muſt be Heart-buſineſs, a Soul-buſineſs; yea, not a buſineſs in the outer court of affections, but in the flower of affections, and in the innermoſt cabinet of the ſoul, where Chriſt is form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Shall a man be cordial in any thing, and not in this, which doth comprize all his chief intereſts, and his everlaſting ſtate within it? Shall the Lord be ſaid to rejoyce over a man, as a Bridegroom rejoyceth over his Bride, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62. and to reſt in his love with joy, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.17. and ſhall not the heart of man go out and meet
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:000977_0154_0FAE8CE14051C1B0"/>
Him here? The Heart or nothing; Love or nothing; Marriage-love which goeth from heart to heart; Love of Eſpouſals or nothing, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.26. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.2. I will not ſay, that there is in all, as ſoon as they believe, a prevailing ſenſible love, which maketh ſick; but there muſt be in believing a rational and kindly love, ſo well grounded, and deeply engaging that many waters cannot quench it: It is ſtrong as Death, and Jealouſie in it burneth as fire, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8 6, 7.</p>
            <p>The third property or qualification of believing as it goeth out after Chriſt, <hi>It muſt be Rational.</hi> Hereby I mean that the man ſhould move towards God in Chriſt, in knowledge and underſtanding, taking up Gods device of ſaving Sinners by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as the Scripture doth hold it out, not phanſying a CHRIST to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf other wayes than the Goſpel ſpeaketh of Him, nor any other way of relief by him than the Word of God holdeth out. Therefore we find knowledge joyned to the Covenant between God and Man as a requiſite, <hi>Jer.</hi> 24.7. <hi>Jer</hi> 31.34. I mean here alſo, that a man be in calmneſs of Spirit, and as it were in his cold blood in cloſing with <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> not in a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:000977_0155_0FAE8CE327392728"/>
fit of affection which ſoon vaniſheth <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.20. Nor in a diſtemper through ſome outward diſtreſs, as the People were <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.34 and proved not ſtedfaſt in the Covenant; nor under a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome outward temporary intereſt, as <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mon Magus</hi> was when he believed, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. A man <hi>muſt</hi> act here rationally, as being Maſter of himſelf, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure able to judge of the Good or Evil of the thing as it ſtands before him.</p>
            <p>The fourth is, <hi>Faith as it it goeth out Rationally, ſo it goeth out Reſolutely.</hi> The poor diſtreſſed people in the Goſpel, did moſt reſolutely caſt themſelves upon <hi>Chriſt.</hi> This reſoluteneſs of Spirit, is in order to all difficulties that lie in the way. Violence is offered to theſe. The man whoſe heart is a ſhaping-out for <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> cannot ſay, <hi>There is a Lyon in the street. Prov.</hi> 26.13. If he cannot have acceſs by the door, he will break through the roof of the houſe, with that man, <hi>Luk.</hi> 5.19. He often doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that which the world calleth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion or prudence, like <hi>Zacheus</hi> climb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon a Tree to ſee <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when Faith was breeding in his boſome, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:000977_0156_0FAE8CE3A3C02D08"/>
This reſoluteneſs of Spirit looketh to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards what inconveniencies may follow, and waveth all theſe, at leaſt reſolving over all theſe, like a wiſe builder who reckoneth the expence beforehand, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.28. This reſoluteneſs is alſo in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to all a mans Idols, and ſuch weights as would eaſily beſet him, if he did not bend after CHRIST over them all, like that blind man who did caſt his Garment from him when <hi>Christ</hi> called him, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.50. This reſoluteneſs in the Soul, proceedeth from deſperate ſelf neceſſity within the man, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.30. and from the ſoveraign command of God, obliging the man to move towards <hi>Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.23 and from the good report gone abroad of God, that He putteth none away that come unto Him through <hi>Chriſt, Joh.</hi> 6.37. but doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend ſuch as do adventure over the greateſt difficulties, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.18. But above all, this reſoluteneſs doth proceed from tde Arm of JEHOVAH, ſecretly and ſtrongly drawing the Sinner towards CHRIST, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6 44. I will not ſay that every one, cloſing with <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the offers of the Goſpel, hath all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid thoughts formally in his mind; yet
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:000977_0157_0FAE8CE5E7BC8028"/>
upon ſearch, it will be found, if he be put to it, or put in mind of theſe things, they are then aloft in the Soul.</p>
            <p>By what is ſaid, it doth manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that many in the viſible Church had need to do ſomewhat further for ſecuring of their Soul, when they come to years of diſcretion, then is found to have been done by them before, in the Covenant between God and the Church, ſealed to them in Baptiſm. By what is ſaid alſo, there is a competent guard upon the free Grace of God in the Goſpel, held out through <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi>: ſo as ignorant, ſenſeleſs, profane men cannot with any ſhadow of reaſon pretend to an intereſt in it. It is true, believing in <hi>Chriſt</hi> and cloſing with Him as a perfect Saviour, ſeemeth eaſie, and every Godleſs man ſaith, that he believeth on Him: But they deceive themſelves, ſince their Soul hath neve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> cordially, rationally, and reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gone out after <hi>Christ Jeſus,</hi> as we have ſaid. It may be ſome wicked men have been enlightned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4 and have found ſome reel in their fear, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.25. or in their joy, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.20. <hi>Mark</hi> 6.20. But not having engaged their heart in approaching to God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.20.
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:000977_0158_0FAE8CE6E21F90B0"/>
have either ſitten down in that common work, as their ſanctuary, until the tryal came, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.20. or they return back with the Dog to their vomit, from which they had in ſome meaſure eſcaped by the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour, 2 <hi>Pet</hi> 2.20. or they utterly fall away to the hatred and malicious deſpiſing and perſecuting of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and His <hi>interests</hi>; from whence hardly they can be recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, — <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26, — which things ſhould provoke men to be ſerious in this great buſineſs.</p>
            <p>We come now to ſpeak to the fifth thing propoſed, and that is, <hi>What be the native conſequents of true believing</hi>? I ſhall reduce what I will ſpeak of them to theſe two, viz. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with God,</hi> and <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. That men have once ſome way at leaſt, been in hands with it, or had the offer of it, as is true of the Phariſees.</p>

by the ſpirit of Perſecution, as the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees did ſtill. They rail againſt it: therefore it is called, <hi>Blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt, Mat.</hi> 12.24.31. They would Crucifie CHRIST again, if they could, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6 6. They are adverſaries, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.27.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Conſider the properties of this acting.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is <hi>Avowed:</hi> that is, not ſeeking to ſhelter or hide it ſelf. The Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees ſpake againſt Chriſt publickly, <hi>Mat</hi> 12.24. They would have Chriſt brought to an <hi>Open ſhame, Heb.</hi> 6.6.

                  <p n="2">2. The party acteth <hi>Freely</hi>: It is not from unadviſedneſs, nor from force or conſtraint, but an acting of free choice; Nothing doth force the Phariſees to ſpeak againſt and perſecute Chriſt. They Crucifie to <hi>Themſelves,</hi> they re-act the Murder of their own free accord, and in their own boſome, none conſtraining them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.6. They ſin of free choice; as the word is, <hi>Spontaneouſly, Heb.</hi> 10.27.</p>

                     <pb n="184" facs="unknown:000977_0181_0FAE8D000527DAD0"/>3. It is acted <hi>Wilfully.</hi> They are ſo reſolute, they will not be diſſwaded by any offer, or the moſt precious means, as is clear in the foreſaid Scriptures.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is done <hi>Maliciouſly</hi>; ſo as it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not ſo much, if at all, from a temptation to pleaſure, profit, or honour; It proceedeth not from fear, or force, or from any good end propoſed; but out of heart-malice againſt God and Chriſt, and the advancement of His Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Kingdom. So that it is of the very nature of Satans ſin, who hath an irreconcileable hatred againſt God, and the remedy of Sin, becauſe his Glory is thereby advanced: This is a ſpecial ingredient in this Sin. The Phariſees are found guilty of heart-malice againſt Chriſt, ſince they ſpeak ſo againſt Him, and not againſt their own Children caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out Devils; and this is the force of Chriſts argument, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.27. They do their utmoſt to Crucifie <hi>Chriſt</hi> again, and to bring Him to an open ſhame, <hi>Heb</hi> 6.6, They are adverſaries like the Devil, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.27.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is done <hi>Deſpightfully.</hi> The malice muſt bewray it ſelf. The Phariſees muſt proclaim that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath correſpondence
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:000977_0182_0FAE8D01ACD91C10"/>
with Devils, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. He muſt be put to an open ſhame, and Crucified again, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. They muſt tread under foot that Blood, and do deſpight to the Spirit, <hi>Heb</hi> 10.29. So that the party had rather periſh a thouſand times, than be in <hi>Chriſts</hi> debt for Salvation. The laſt thing in the deſcription, is, the ordinary atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant or conſequence of this ſin: <hi>It breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth deſperate and hopeleſs Fear.</hi> They fear Him, whom they hate with a ſlaviſh hopeleſs fear, ſuch as Devils have <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.27. They know that God will put out His power againſt them: they trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the rememmbrance of it; And if they could be above Him, and deſtroy Him, they covet it; and ſince they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach that, they hate with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of heart-malice, and do perſecute Him and all that is His, with deſpight.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Third</hi> thing propoſed, viz. <hi>The Concluſions to be drawn from what is ſaid, whereby we will ſpeak directly to the Objection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>As I hinted before, ſince the Sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Holy Ghost is ſo remarkable, and may be well known where it is, none ſhould charge themſelves with it, unleſs they can prove and inſtruct the charge</hi>: for it

                  <p>Before I ſpeak directly to this expreſs Covenanting with God, I promiſe theſe few things;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>I do not here intend a Covenanting with God, eſſentially differing from the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant between God and the viſible Church, as the Lord doth hold it out in His revealed Will.</hi> Neither do I intend a Covenant, differing eſſentially from that tranſacting of the heart with God in Chriſt, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſpoken unto: It is that ſame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, only it differeth by a ſingular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> the formal expreſſion of the thing which the heart did before practice.</p>

<pb n="199" facs="unknown:000977_0196_0FAE8D1235D91C48"/>
this expreſs verbal Covenanting with God, is very expedient, for the better being of a mans ſtate, and his more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable maintaining of an intereſt in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>This expreſs Covenanting with God by word of Mouth, is of no worth, without ſincere heart-cloſing with God in Chriſt joyned with it</hi>: For without that, it is but a prophaning of the Lords Name, and a mocking of Him to his face, ſo to draw near unto him with the lips, whileſt the heart is far away from him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>I grant, both Cordial and Verbal tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacting with God, will not make out a mans gracious eſtate unto him, ſo as to put and keep it above controverſie, without the joynt-witneſs of the Spirit, by which we know what is freely given unto us of God</hi>; yet this explicite way of tranſacting with God, joyned with the heart cloſing with Him in Chriſt, contributes much for clearing up unto a man, that there is a fixed bargain between God and him, and will do much to ward off him many ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs jealouſies and objections of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable mind and heart, which uſeth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frontedly to deny this hour, what it did really act and perform the former hour.
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:000977_0197_0FAE8D12B1D55AD0"/>
This explicite Covenanting, is as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument taken of what paſt between God and the Soul, and ſo hath its own advantage for ſtrengthening of Faith.</p>
                  <p>As for this expreſs Covenanting, we ſhall (1.) Shew that it a very warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table practice. (2.)

                  <p n="1">1.

It is the approven practice of the Saints in Scripture, thus expreſly to Covenant with God, and they have found much quiet in that duty afterwards. <hi>David</hi> did often expreſly ſay unto God, that he was his God, his Portion, and that himſelf was his Servant <hi>Thomas</hi> will put his intereſt out of queſtion with it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.28 Yea, I ſay, the Saints are much quieted in remembrance of what hath paſt that way between God and them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142.5. We find it often in the Book of the <hi>Canticles.</hi> Now ſhall the chief worthies of God be ſo much in Duty, breeding ſo much quiet and ſatisfaction to them in many caſes, and ſhall we be under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, unto whom acceſs is miniſtred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly, and who partake of the ſap of the Olive; ſhall we (I ſay) ly behind in this approven piece of homelineſs with God?

                  <p>This alſo may have its own weight, as an argument to preſs this way of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting with God.

            <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>WHAT is the great buſineſs a man hath to do in the world?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> To make ſure a Saving Intereſt in Chriſt Jeſus, and to walk ſuitably thereunto.</p>
            <p>Queſt· 2. <hi>Have not all the Members of the viſible Church a Saving Intereſt in Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No verily; yea, but a very few of them have it.</p>
            <p>Queſt 3. <hi>How ſhall I know if I have a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving interest <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n Him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Ordinarily the Lord prepareth His own way in the Soul, by a work of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, and diſcovereth a mans ſin &amp; miſery to him, and exerciſeth him ſo therewith, that he longs for the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 4. <hi>How ſhall I know if I have got a competent diſcovery of my ſin and miſery?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> A competent ſight of it, maketh a man take Salvation to heart above any thing in this world: It maketh him diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim

all relief in himſelf, even in his beſt things: It maketh Chriſt, who is the Redeemer, very precious to the Soul: It maketh a man ſtand in awe to ſin afterwards, maketh him content to be ſaved upon any terms God pleaſeth.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 5. <hi>What other way may I diſcern a Saving intereſt in Him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> By the going out of my heart ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly &amp; affectionately towards Him, as He is held out in the Goſpel, and this is Faith or Believing.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 6. <hi>How ſhall I know if my heart goeth out after Him aright, and that my Faith is true Saving Faith?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Where the heart goeth out aright after Him, in true and ſaving Faith, the Soul pleaſeth Chriſt alone above all things, &amp; pleaſeth Him in all His three Offices, to rule and inſtruct as well as to ſave; and is content to cleave unto Him, whatſoever inconvenience may follow.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 7. <hi>What other marks of a Saving intereſt in Chriſt can you give to me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> He that is in Chriſt ſavingly, is a New Creature, he is graciouſly changed and renewed in ſome meaſure in the whole man, &amp; in all his wayes; point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

towards all the known Commands of God.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 8. <hi>What if I find ſin now and then prevail over me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Although every Sin deſerveth everlaſting vengeance, yet if thou be afflicted for your failings, confeſs them with ſhame of face unto God, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to ſtrive againſt them honeſtly henceforth, and flee unto Chriſt for Pardon, you obtain mercy, and intereſt ſtands ſure.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 9. <hi>What ſhall the man do who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lay claim to Chriſt Jeſus, nor any of thoſe marks ſpoken of?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Let him not take reſt, until he make ſure unto himſelf a Saving intereſt in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Queſt 10. <hi>What way can a man make ſure an interest in Chriſt, who never had a Saving intereſt in Him hitherto?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> He muſt take his Sins to heart, &amp; his great hazard thereby, and he muſt take to heart Gods offer of Pardon and Peace through Chriſt Jeſus, and hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cloſe with Gods offer, by betaking himſelf unto Chriſt, the bleſſed refuge.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 11. <hi>What if my ſins be ſingularly hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and great beyond ordinary?</hi>

            <p>Queſt. 12. <hi>Is Faith in Chriſt only required of me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

            <p>Queſt. 13. <hi>How ſhall I be ſure that my heart doth accept of Gods offer, and doth cloſe with Chriſt Jeſus?</hi>
            </p>

            <p>Queſt 14. <hi>What may ſhall I do that?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Set apart ſame bit of time, and having conſidered your own loſt eſtate, and the relief offered by Chriſt Jeſus, work up your heart to pleaſe and cloſe with that offer, and ſay unto God expreſly, that you do accept of that offer, and of Him to be your God in Chriſt; and do give up your ſelf to be ſaved in His way, without reſervation or exception in any caſe; and that you

henceforth will wait for Salvation in the way He hath appointed.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 15. <hi>What if I break unto God after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> You muſt reſolve on His ſtrength not to break, &amp; watch over your own way, and put your heart in His hand to keep it: And if you break, you muſt confeſs it unto God, and judge your ſelf for it, and flee to the Advocate for Pardon, and reſolve to do no more ſo: and this you muſt do as often as you fail.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 16. <hi>How ſhall I come to full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of my intereſt in Christ, ſo as it may be above controverſie?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Learn to lay your weight upon the Blood of Chriſt, and ſtudy Purity and Holineſs in all manner of Converſation, and Pray for the witneſs of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to joyn with the Bloud and the Water; and His Teſtimony added un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe, will eſtabliſh you in the Faith of an intereſt in CHRIST.</p>
