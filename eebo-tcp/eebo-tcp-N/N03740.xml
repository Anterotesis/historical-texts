            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>Whilſt the Seller of theſe has not been content to part with them for Bills of Credit without ſome Advance, and whilſt the Buyer, to ſerve his preſent Turn, has yielded to give that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, they have by that Means, in too ſound a Senſe, been the Clippers of our Coin (i. e. our Bills of Credit) and had the firſt Hand in all that Injuſtice and Oppreſſion, which has been the unavoidable Conſequence of their Practice herein.</p>
            <p>And now what is the great Temptation that has led them into this Practice? 'Tis undoubtedly ſome Gain to themſelves, either real or imaginary. But what real Gain have they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd or could they have in View, which can be thought ſo tempting, as to lead them into a Practice ſo pernicious to the Publick, and of ſo pernicious Conſequence in regard of Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, who are in no Capacity to ward off the Wrong they ſuſtain hereby?</p>
            <p>As to the Vender of theſe Commodities, the very Day he got up his Silver (for Inſtance) from 20 <abbr>
                  <hi>ſ.</hi>
               </abbr> to 22 <abbr>
                  <hi>ſ.</hi>
               </abbr> per Ounce, he ſunk the Bills he receiv'd 2 <abbr>
                  <hi>ſ.</hi>
               </abbr> in the Pound. And now, ſuppoſe he was One whoſe Debt did exceed his Credit, though in this Caſe he might diſcharge a 20 <abbr>
                  <hi>ſ.</hi>
               </abbr> Debt and have 2 <abbr>
                  <hi>ſ.</hi>
               </abbr> left to himſelf; yet ſince his Gain was his Creditors Loſs, if he be a Man of Juſtice and Honeſty, I ſhould think he can take but little Satisfaction in it.</p>
            <p>But this, as I apprehend, has not often been the Caſe, but the Generality of thoſe who have had Silver to ſell, have been ſuch, the Ballance of whoſe Accompts have been in their own Favour.</p>
            <p>Some Years ſince, a Gentleman who had Silver by him, told me, ſuch a Merchant had been with him to buy, but that upon his holding his Silver at a higher Rate (as I remember 18 <abbr>
                  <hi>d.</hi>
               </abbr> or 2 <abbr>
                  <hi>ſ.</hi>
               </abbr> per Oz.) than it had uſually paſs'd at, they parted, yet nevertheleſs within a few Days after, the ſame Merchant ſent him Province Bills to exchange with him at his own Price; which hereupon ſoon became the common Rate at which Silver was ſold.</p>
            <p>This was a Gentleman free of Debt perhaps as any in the Province, and had not only a large Sum due to him upon Book, but many <hi>Hundreds of Pounds</hi> due upon Bond, payable in Province Bills. And now ſuppoſe he gain'd 2 <abbr>
                  <hi>ſ.</hi>
               </abbr> per Oz. upon his Silver for two or three hundred Ounces, he for that Gain (ſuppoſing he rais'd it from 20 <abbr>
                  <hi>ſ.</hi>
               </abbr> to 22 <abbr>
                  <hi>ſ.</hi>
               </abbr> per Oz.) loſt 2 <abbr>
                  <hi>ſ.</hi>
               </abbr> per Pound upon a Sum perhaps more than <hi>two or three thouſand
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004585_0004_100D6A93096B6080"/>Pounds.</hi> And I doubt not but this has been the Caſe with many others; which when they experience the Truth of, however inſtrumental they themſelves have been in bringing it to paſs, they ſeem to diſregard that, and fill their Mouths with Exclamations againſt the Government, for not keeping up the Credit of their Bills!</p>
            <p>And now let us conſider the Caſe of the Buyer. And here, I ſee not but the Advance he makes, is at preſent to his own Loſs. And the great Reaſon why he is willing to ſuſtain this Loſs, is the Proſpect he has of making it up, by ſetting a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable Advance upon either the Goods he has already in his Poſſeſſion, or thoſe that next come to Hand, or both: And if he make no greater Advance upon theſe, than barely to make up his Loſs, where is his Gain? And if he make a greater, under this Pretence, where is his Honeſty.</p>
            <p>And now agreable to this Repreſentation, where is the great Gain to either the Seller or Buyer of Silver and Gold, for the Sake of which they ſhould be led (as I ſaid) into this Practice, ſo pernicious to the Publick, <hi>&amp;c?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if there be a greater Gain to either, than this Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſets in our View, I am perſwaded, that if it were care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully examined into, it would be found ſuch as will not bear the Light: Nor can I think that thoſe who have acquired it, will be able to take much Satisfaction in it, if they conſider, as I think there is Reaſon they ſhould, That together with their reſpective Shares thereof, they muſt ſhare between them, if not the whole, yet a principal Part of the Guilt ariſing from that Injuſtice and Oppreſſion, which their Practice hath bro't upon the Widow and the Orphan, and all ſuch who depend on certain Sums in Province Bills annually to be paid for their Subſiſtance.</p>
            <p>In brief, as the Emiſſion of Bills of Credit, which ſo well ſerv'd all the Ends of Trade and Commerce amongſt ourſelves, put it into the Power of the Merchant ſoon to ſend off our Silver and Gold, as he did, ſo his bidding upon the Silver ſince imported, has I think been the ſole Cauſe of the ſinking of the Credit of our Province Bills. And it ſeems needleſs and in vain to enquire after any other Cauſe thereof
<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>I am aware of it, that many have freely charg'd the Government with Breach of Faith, in poſtponing Payments eſtabliſhed by Law, and aſſign'd this as the Reaſon of the fall of the Credit of our Bills. But if I am not miſinform'd, this has Reference only to the Payments of the ſeveral Loans that have been granted. With reſpect to which (as I humbly conceive) it will be difficult to demonſtrate any Injuſtice in the Delays of thoſe Payments, more than there is when a private Perſon that lets his Money upon Intereſt, taking Bond for the Payment thereof in one Year, delays putting his Bond in Sute againſt the Debter imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, if at that Period he doth not make Payment. But to aſſign this Indulgence to the Debter whilſt he has given good Security, and which remains good and ſufficient for the Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Bills and Intereſt, as any Cauſe of the ſinking the Credit of the Bills ſo lett, ſeems not to have ſo much as the Shadow of a Reaſon to ſupport it.</hi>
               </note>. And unleſs,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004585_0005_100D6A96EFA2FA10"/>agreable to what I before obferv'd, we might ſuppoſe that the Sellers and Buyers of Silver and Gold will alter their Practice, and act more upon Principles of Wiſdom, Honour and Juſtice, than they have done, 'twill be but a vain Thing to hope for the Continuance of that Credit our publick Bills at preſent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, nor will it be in the Power of any Laws to ſupport their ſinking Credit.</p>
            <p>But if once our Merchants, who have the Value of our Bills ſet by the Legiſlature, at their Emiſſion, and who have the Ballances in their Hands, and ought to eſteem the keeping in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variable the Medium with which they carry on their Trade, as an eſſential Baſis of their juſt Commerce, will be prevail'd with to take up and keep inviolate a juſt Reſolution, not to undervalue our Bills by over-rating Silver and Gold, there will be nothing wanting, either in the Funds upon which they have been emitted, or in the Ends and Uſes to which they may ſerve, in order to their being preſerved in their full Credit and Value.</p>
            <p>And I ſhould think what I have ſaid, together with thoſe further Thoughts, which thoſe who cloſely attend to Reaſon, will by theſe brief Hints, be naturally led into, would be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to induce every Man of Penetration and Virtue to take up and keep this Reſolution. And ſhould there be found any, whoſe earthly Souls can't be made to ſee an Hair's Breadth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Circle of ſelf, and who care nothing for the Good of their Country, nor regard the Injuries and Oppreſſions their Neighbours ſuſtain, ſo that their private perſonal Gain be but ſecured and advanced; theſe ought to be diſcouraged by penal Laws, in their unrighteous Practices.</p>
            <p>And as to this Practice of giving or receiving any Advance in Bills of Credit for Silver or Gold more than 5 per Cent. above the Value ſet upon thoſe Bills by the Legiſlature at their Emiſſion, I think, Juſtice requires that they ſhould, upon their

            <p>Having premiſed theſe general Thoughts, I ſhall adventure to offer a Scheme for ſupplying the Province with a Medium of Trade, which may at preſent relieve the preſſing Difficulties under which it labours, prevent thoſe further Oppreſſions the Inhabitants lie expoſed to, and in the Iſſue introduce a better Medium.</p>

            <p>And that the Remainder of the ſaid Sum of 90000 Oz. be left as an additional Fund for the more ſpeedy and effectual drawing in and ſinking the Bills outſtanding. 'Tis ſuppoſed that the Province Charge will be included, with the 20000 <abbr>

            <p n="2">2. That which is here propos'd, ſtrongly tends to defeat the unrighteous Hopes, and diſcourage the oppreſſive Practices of avaritious Men: For as there will be a Medium of Trade provided, ſo there will be a growing Sum in the Treaſury to be let upon good Security at lawful Intereſt, by which Means Perſons will not lie at the Mercy of their Oppreſſors, but may be ſupply'd where they will be treated with Juſtice. And if finally they become Debtors to their own Towns, 'tis to be expected they will be treated by their Neighbours agreable to the Laws of Kindneſs.</p>

               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:004585_0009_100D6A9F429BD4D8"/>
3. That we ſhall be furniſhed with a Medium of Trade, which for the preſent Time, will be as good to all Intents and Purpoſes within ourſelves, as Silver and Gold; and ſuch a one as will hold its Value: For theſe Bills being receiv'd by the Province Treaſurer, and by the Company, according to the Tenor thereof, it will not be in the Power of others to depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate them. If others ſhould advance upon their Commodities, the Effect would be, that the Company (acting with Juſtice and Honour) would draw all the Trade of the Province. And unleſs others can make ſuch Advance, there is no Danger of their bidding upon Silver and Gold, and conſequently no Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Bills being depreciated, eſpecially when 'tis further conſider'd, that in a few Years they will convert into Silver and Gold.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That at the Period propos'd, the Province will be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with a Medium for Trade in Silver and Gold, of more Value than 600000 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> of the preſent Currency; and every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Perſon have his Proportion of it in his Pocket or at Intereſt.</p>
            <p>The great Enquiry is, <hi>Whether what has been propos'd is prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable?</hi> And in order to the forming a proper Judgment upon this Head, theſe three Things are carefully to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Part propos'd to be undertaken by the</hi> SUBSCRIBERS.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Part aſſign'd to the</hi> PROVINCE.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>What Influence this</hi> SCHEME, <hi>ſhould it take Effect, would have upon our</hi> Britiſh <hi>Plantations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. The Part propos'd to be undertaken by the Subſcribers. And this, beſides the Obligation they lay themſelves under, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd in the Face of the Bills, is only to pay in 10 per Cent. annually, of the reſpective Sums they receive, 'till the whole be paid. And ſurely, with but ordinary Succeſs in their Trade, they will be able to do this, and find their Account in undertaking it.</p>
            <p>I ſay 'tis only this, beſides the Obligation he brings himſelf under to receive 20 <abbr>
                  <hi>ſ.</hi>
               </abbr> in theſe Bills, as equal in Value to one Ounce of Silver in all Payments; which Obligation why ſhould any Merchant decline bringing himſelf under? Were the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium with which they carry on their Trade, wholly Silver and Gold, and ſo ſuch as with little or no Variation would hold its Value, would he not then, generally ſpeaking, ſet the ſame Advance upon his Goods from Year to Year, and yet have ſufficient Encouragement to proceed in his Buſineſs? And why is there not then as great Encouragement to proceed in
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004585_0010_100D6AA19692ABD8"/>it, upon Suppoſition, the proper Medium is preſerv'd in its full Value, and he goes on to ſet his Advance accordingly? But here 'twill be ſaid, That though in the ſuppos'd Caſe he might have the ſame Encouragement, yet that in our preſent Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, he is ſo ſtraitned and preſs'd for Returns, and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver being ſo ſcarce, which is the beſt Commodity to make Returns in, thoſe that have it being fully knowing to all this, will not part with their Silver for theſe Bills, without Advance; and therefore if he obtain them, he muſt comply to give it.</p>
            <p>To this I reply,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That allowing the Truth of what is here ſuggeſted, and that the Merchant for theſe Reaſons ſhould give ſome Advance in Bills for Silver to make Returns, doth it thence follow that he muſt needs raiſe in Proportion upon all his Commodities? Is there any Reaſon in it, that becauſe Silver is ſcarce and in Demand, he gives ſome Advance in Bills for it, that therefore he muſt make the ſame Advance upon all other Commodities, tho' they be not ſcarce nor in ſo great Demand? It would be no Detriment to the Credit of the Bills, if ſuch an Advance was given in Exchange for Silver, as might be ſufficient to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Perſons to make the Exchange, if at the ſame Time the Bills were allowed to have their juſt Value (i. e. the Value ſet on them by the Legiſlature) in the purchaſing all other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities. Nor in this Caſe would there be any Danger of their fluctuating, but their Value would be nevertheleſs invariable.</p>
            <p>But</p>
            <p n="2">2. What imaginable Reaſon is there, or what Advantage can it be under the Circumſtances pleaded, for the Merchant to go on from Year to Year to bid higher and higher for Silver? An Ounce of Silver now it coſts 29 <abbr>
                  <hi>ſ.</hi>
               </abbr> in Province Bills, is no better at <hi>London</hi> than it was when it coſt but <hi>Twenty Shillings</hi> in the ſame Bills: And 20 <abbr>
                  <hi>ſ.</hi>
               </abbr> then as effectually and readily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured it, as 29 <abbr>
                  <hi>ſ.</hi>
               </abbr> doth now. In brief, as Silver, let the Price of it here be what it will, is not thereby alter'd in its Value at Home; ſo it was as readily ſold, by thoſe that had it, when it was but 9 <abbr>
                  <hi>ſ.</hi>
               </abbr> per Oz. as it is now 'tis 29 <abbr>
                  <hi>ſ.</hi>
               </abbr> And however the Merchant is preſs'd for Returns, and Silver be the beſt Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity to anſwer that End, yet he can have no more Silver than there is; and a ſmaller Advance, as Experience has ſhown, has been as effectual to draw into his Hands the whole of that, as a greater. And were this Practice of giving higher and higher for Silver, laid aſide, every Perſon that wants would have as good a Proſpect of being ſupply'd, as in this Way. For if none gave ſuch Advance, the Seller would not expect it, but he that firſt ſpake, would have the Refuſal; and when thoſe that want <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, look out with greater Care and Diligence, they may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004585_0011_100D6AA4CD8B5C88"/>Succeſs, and their Practice is more rational and far leſs exceptional, than in ſtriving to anſwer their End by bidding a greater Advance than others are willing to give.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I reply, That whatever Straits the Merchant may be in for Returns, and however great his Temptations may be under all Circumſtances, to raiſe the Price he gives for Silver, yet theſe will not juſtify him in the Practice, if the Practice it ſelf be ſuch as involves Injuſtice or Diſhoneſty in it. Which that it doth I think I have already ſaid enough to evince. To which I ſhall only deſire the Reader to add, the Conſideration of the Way which this Practice opens to deſigning Men, to deal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly to the laſt Degree.</p>
            <p>And I think he can't but diſcern, ſo much of this, as to ſhew him, upon how precarious Foundations Juſtice &amp; Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſtand, in the preſent State of our Affairs, and of how great Importance it is, that proper Care ſhould be taken in the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And that therefore the Obligation propoſed (and under our Conſideration) is both reaſonable and important, and what no wiſe and juſt Man ſhould decline, in the moſt explicit Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to bring himſelf under.</p>
            <p>But I now paſs,</p>
            <p n="2">II. To conſider the Part in this Scheme aſſigned to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and this is to pay in annually a Tax of <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> 200000. That is ſo much beſides the current Charges of each Year, which this Scheme doth not meddle with.</p>
            <p>And I ſhould think this no inſupportable Burden: 'Tis true the Inhabitants of the Province complain of the Weight of the Taxes at preſent laid upon them; but 'tis to be conſider'd, that the preſent Taxes are heavier, and will continue ſo to be till 1743, than what is here propoſed. And beſides, the Ground of the preſent Complaint is really not ſo much becauſe of the Greatneſs of the Tax, as the Scarcity of Money. And ſince in this Scheme there is Proviſion made for a competent Supply, it can't be thought, but that they will bear eaſily the Tax propoſed, and that with the greater Chearfulneſs, ſeeing they will not only be, perhaps more than rewarded by the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit they will receive from the Uſe of ſo good a Medium of Exchange, but after a few Years, will have their Bills return'd into their own Hands in good Silver and Gold, with Intereſt.</p>
            <p n="3">III. What Influence this Scheme, ſhould it take Effect, will have upon our Britiſh Trade.</p>
            <p>I mention this, becauſe, that however we might argue, that by our Charter the General Aſſembly of the Province, are veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with full Power to tranſact ſuch an Affair in and by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet ſince the principal Advantage <hi>Great Britain</hi> reaps from the Plantations, ariſes from the ſupplying them with their
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004585_0012_100D6AA6C0B86ED8"/>Manufacturies, and receiving in Returns ſuch Commodities as the Plantations have or can get in their Power: If ſuch a Scheme as this ſhould be thought to clog that Trade, and ſo be detrimental to his Majeſty's good Subjects there, 'tis but juſt to expect that Obſtructions will be thrown in the Way, to prevent its taking Effect.</p>
            <p>And I think, as the Matter has been managed amongſt us, 'tis no wonder that it has reached his Majeſty's Ear, and that he has ſo far interpoſed in the Affair of our emitting Bills of Credit, as to give Inſtructions to his Governour of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince relating thereto. For beyond doubt, the Merchants in <hi>London,</hi> who have ſupplied us with their valuable Commodities, have not only, been ſometimes long kept out of their Money, but when it has come to Hand, it has fallen ſhort of what it ought to have been, as much as our Paper-Currency has ſunk in its Credit, which however it may not have been the Effect of Deſign and Pre-meditation in our Merchants, yet it has really been an Injuſtice, and ſo far as this has been the Caſe, his Majeſty's endeavouring to redreſs it, by giving ſuch Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to his Governour, as he thought proper for that End, ought to be deem'd, but the Fruit of his paternal Care for the good of his Subjects.</p>
            <p>But now if what is here propoſed, will be found upon Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, ſufficient to fix the Value of our Bills, the Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance will be removed, and upon a proper Repreſentation the Inſtructions will undoubtedly be recall'd, eſpecially if it be further found that this Scheme, tends greatly to the flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Britiſh Trade, and ſo to the mutual Advantage of his Majeſty's good Subjects there and in this Province, which that it doth might eaſily be demonſtrated, but I forbear; and ſhall now cloſe by obſerving,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That in the foregoing Scheme I have the rather ſet the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, at the Rate I have, that ſo they might the better correſpond with thoſe Bills of Credit of this Province, already paſſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us. For whilſt the Law ſets thoſe of the new Tenor (as we diſtinguiſh them) at 6 <abbr>
                  <hi>ſ.</hi>
               </abbr> 8 <abbr>
                  <hi>d.</hi>
               </abbr> the Ounce, and at the ſame Time requires three for one, if paid in Bills of the old Tenor, it doth in Effect ſet the old Tenor Bills at the Rate of 20 <abbr>

               </abbr> the Ounce. And however by an ill Management, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of thoſe Sorts of Bills, at preſent carry in them that Value, eſpecially as received by the Merchant, yet they ought to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it, and I think their ſinking Credit ought ſo far to be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, as to bring them to that, as being (all Things conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd) the moſt proper Standard. And as the Government are obliged to receive them at that Rate, ſo it may be of good Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect for the aboveſaid Company to take them in all Payments
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004585_0013_100D6AA8B4DD95A8"/>at the ſame Rate too; and as it will be needful that a proper Inſtrument be drawn for them to ſubſcribe, it ſeems very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeable, there ſhould be an Article therein obliging them ſo to do.</p>
            <p>This being undertaken and comply'd with, will certainly fix an equal Value upon the Bills projected in the foregoing Scheme, and thoſe already extant, nor can there I think be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Danger but that both will hold their Value, for what ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable Reaſon can there be, for any to ſet a leſs Value upon <hi>Twenty Shillings</hi> in theſe Bills than upon an Ounce of Silver? if at preſent it will purchaſe the ſame Quantity of ſuch Goods as he wants, that an Ounce of Silver would, and which had he the Silver, he would part with it for? The Truth is, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I have to part with, that will as well procure what I at preſent want, as Silver and Gold would, is at preſent as good to me, as Silver and Gold themſelves. For which Reaſon, he that can think abſtractly, muſt, I think, be able to ſee, that a Medium of Trade, conſidered meerly as ſuch, is no whit the better or worſe, on Account of what we call intrinſick Value, be the ſame greater or leſs. But its true Value as a Medium of Trade is to be eſtimated, by the Credit it obtains, and the Demand it is in. And ſince Silver and Gold were never in greater Demand in any Common-Wealth, than our Paper-Medium is, and is like to continue to be in this Province, there appears nothing wanting in the Nature of Things to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port its Value, ſo long as we have Silver and Gold, Fiſh, Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and all Neceſſaries of Life to buy, ſo long as we have Ships and Houſes to build, Farms to purchaſe and ſubdue, and <hi>Debts to pay;</hi> and ſo long as with our Paper-Medium all theſe Things may be accompliſhed, there is no Hazard of its not being in Demand.</p>
            <p>The only Thing needful then to keep up its Value, is the making a proper and reſolute Stand againſt that inconfiderate Folly (to put the moſt charitable Conſtruction upon it) which it was the main Deſign of the Pages preceeding the foregoing Scheme to detect. Which Folly might and ought in Juſtice, I think, to have been corrected long ago (and eſpecially by the Merchants at that Juncture when they emitted their Notes) and which it will be in the Power of the Company ſhould this Scheme take Effect, by a wiſe and juſt Management eaſily to over-rule.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Although I have ſet to the foregoing Scheme (to the End it might be the more fully conceiv'd of) the Period of 1760, yet the Reader will obſerve that I have left the Matter of fixing the Period to the Diſcretion of the General Court. And although that ſhould be the Period fix'd by them, and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004585_0014_100D6AACD0699D48"/>agreable to what has been projected, the Province ſhould then be furniſhed with ſo large and valuable a Medium, and that ſo effectually ſcattered amongſt the Inhabitants, yet it is very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whether the State of the Trade of the Province will not then be ſuch, as that in a few Years, it will grow too ſcant to ſerve the End, thro' the Demand Silver and Gold will ſtill be in for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation. And whether it will not be found that a Paper-Medium, is better adapted to promote the Trade and Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Province, than one that conſiſts of Silver and Gold.</p>
            <p>It has been generally complain'd of, as a Failure in our Trade, That our Importation exceeds our Exportation, and this has been aſſign'd by many as the Reaſon why Silver and Gold don't center with us. But if thoſe that advance this, would be underſtood to intend, That our Exportation falls ſhort of being ſufficient to pay for what is imported to us, I think it can't in Reaſon be true; for were this the Caſe, we ſhould long ere now been Bankrupt. And if they intend that the Value of what we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port as Returns, exceeds the Value of our Exportation, and this be true, 'tis by no Means to be complain'd of as a Failure in our Trade. Yet, ſuppoſe the Balance of theſe were a <hi>Million</hi> a Year in our Favour, it would not thence <hi>neceſſarily</hi> follow, that any of that Balance would reſt with us in Silver and Gold. (tis true, if our Exportation ſhould be ſufficient to procure a greater Quantity of foreign Commodities, and Silver and Gold too (which 'tis to be remembred, is not our own Production) than we could ourſelves conſume or apply to the carrying on and increaſing the ſeveral Branches of our Trade, the Balance in this Caſe, would remain with us in Silver and Gold, as being of all our Effects the moſt convenient to lay by. But when or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever this will be the Caſe is uncertain, nor need we concern ourſelves much about it: For, 'till it is the Caſe, tho' Silver and Gold will not abide with us, it will be our Advantage to ſend it off; and the Balance of our Trade, if it be in our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, will remain with us, and naturally center in the Cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and beautifying this extenſive Land, the Accompliſhment whereof will take an almoſt immenſe Sum, it being as yet (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively ſpeaking) but a rough and unpoliſh'd Wilderneſs.</p>
            <p>And 'till this be in ſome good Meaſure accompliſh'd, 'tis not in Reaſon to be expected, that Manufacturies will be carry'd on with any great Degree of Strength and Advantage amongſt us; And conſequently 'tis to be expected that foreign Manufacturies, ſpecially thoſe <hi>Great Britain</hi> abounds with, will be in great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand with us. Nor can the Silver and Gold we may receive from <hi>Spain, Portugal</hi> and the <hi>Weſt-India Iſlands,</hi> be better im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd, than by ſending it to <hi>Great Britain</hi> to procure them for our Uſe.</p>
