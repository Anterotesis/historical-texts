            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PSALM cxix. 116.</bibl>
               <q>—<hi>Let me not be aſhamed of my Hope.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>AS <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Fear,</hi> are the two governing Paſa ſions of the Soul; which excite us to Action: ſo it is of Concern to us, to know how to improve them ſo as to promote our Happineſs. And as we ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our Fears of the Wrath of God and eternal Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo as to quicken us to flee from the Wrath to come, and to fly to the Refuge to lay hold on the Hope ſet before us in Chriſt Jeſus; So we ſhould uſe our Hope, with a View to this great End.</p>
            <p>It is greatly to be feared, that many have ſuch a ſlender and ſandy Foundation of their Hope, that when they ſhall expect, that they are juſt entring into the Poſſeſſion and Enjoyment of what they hoped for; they ſhall find themſelves miſtaken and diſappointed: which is what the Pſalmiſt deprecates in our <hi>Text.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Altho' he may, in this, have ſome Reference to his Hopes of outward good Things agreable to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God to him; yet it appears to me, that he has Reſpect eſpecially to future and eternal Things in this pathetick Prayer; (<hi>Let me not be aſhamed of my Hope.</hi>)</p>
            <p>We are not to expect to find a Connection of one Part with another, in this admirable Pſalm; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall conſider the Words in an abſtracted View: as a Prayer of holy <hi>David,</hi> (who was doubtleſs the Compoſer of this Pſalm, under the Influence and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:005029_0004_100E689069B63518"/>And as this Prayer implies the Danger of our being deceived as to our Hopes of Happineſs and Salvation hereafter; ſo it ſhews us the great Neceſſity there is of our having our <hi>Hopes</hi> of future Happineſs ſo well grounded, that they may not <hi>make us aſhamed,</hi> as the Apoſtle expreſſes it, in Rom. 5. 5. or as in the Text, that we may <hi>not be aſhamed of our Hope</hi>: both of which may be conſidered (by divine Aſſiſtance) under this Doctrine, which I think is very plain from the Words, viz.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>DOCT.</hi> It highly becomes every one of us, to labour and pray, that our Hopes of Happineſs and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the World to come may be built on ſuch Foundations that we may not be aſham'd thereof.</p>
            <p>All Men in general (I believe) cheriſh ſome Hopes that they ſhall be happy, or at leaſt not miſerable, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Death; whether they have any Foundation for ſuch Hopes or no: the moſt profligate Sinners flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themſelves that God will be merciful to them; but how few are there that lay a good Foundation for their Hopes! and how few that frequently and carefully enough examine the Grounds and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of their Hopes of Happineſs!</p>
            <p>It is certain that as the Hope of true Believers ſhall not make them aſhamed, ſo there is the <hi>Hope of the Hypocrite</hi> which ſhall periſh. Job 8. 13, 14.—And <hi>the Hypocrite's Hope ſhall periſh; whoſe Hope ſhall be cut off; and whoſe Truſt ſhall be as the Spider's Web.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence in as much as our eternal Happineſs is ſo nearly concerned in it, it appears to be of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Importance to us, to ſee to it that the Hope we have of eternal Life; be not that of the Hypocrite; but a ſure well grounded Hope, of which we ſhall never be aſhamed.</p>
            <p>It muſt be obſerved here, that a Perſon may be ſaid (in the Senſe of our Text) to be <hi>aſhamed of his
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005029_0005_100E6891EAC92FA0"/>
Hope when he is diſappointed or fruſtrated of the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe Things which he Hopes for.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hope has Reference to Things to come</hi>: what we poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs and enjoy we don't hope for: and as he that comes to enjoy all which he hoped for can't be ſaid to be <hi>aſhamed of his Hope</hi>; ſo Shame and Confuſion will cover them, who, inſtead of the good Things they hoped for, ſhall find themſelves fruſtrated and diſappointed; and made miſerable. This with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to future and eternal Things will be moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing: How dreadful will it be for a Perſon to die. full of Hopes of the Joys and Glories of Heaven and to find inſtead thereof that he is ſent down to the Place of Torment!</p>
            <p>What I further propoſe, for the Proof and Illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of this Doctrine is; to conſider and ſhow;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1.</hi> What that Hope of Salvation, is, which is good and well grounded, and ſo will not make ſuch as have it, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed: and what that Hope is which will make ſuch as reſt in it aſhamed. <hi>And 2.</hi> to offer ſome Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the Proof of the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and to convince us, of the Neceſſity of our ſtriving and praying, that we may all have an Hope of Salvation which we ſhall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of.</p>
            <p>And as theſe Things are of great Importance. I hope I ſhall have your ſerious and diligent Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to what (by divine Help) I ſhall offer.</p>
            <p>And firſt I am to conſider, <hi>What that Hope of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is, which is good and well grounded, and ſo will not make: thoſe that have it, aſhamed: And what that Hope is which will make ſuch as reſt in it aſhamed.</hi> And I ſhall endeavour ſo, to deſcribe theſe, as that we may be the better able to diſtinguiſh between a true and falſe Hope of Happineſs hereafter.</p>
            <p>And that I may be the more eaſily underſtood, I ſhall conſider theſe Things diſtinctly and apart, by
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005029_0006_100E68939B0D8D68"/>
which they will mutually reflect Light on each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Agreeably I would conſider firſt, <hi>What a good and well-grounded Hope of Salvation is, which will not make ſuch as have it aſhamed.</hi> And then ſecondly, <hi>Confider what that falſe Hope is, which ſuch as reſt in it, ſhall be aſhamed of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I am to conſider and ſhow what that good and well-grounded Hope of eternal Happineſs and Salvation is; which will not make ſuch as have it aſhamed: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it will not deceive them at laſt; but they ſhall certainly enjoy the glorious and bleſſed Things, which they hope for.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hope</hi> in general; <hi>is an Expectation, hereafter to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs and enjoy ſomething which we eſteem good, and think will tend to our Happineſs; and ſo deſire it and ſuppoſe upon proper Endeavours, we may obtain it.</hi> This is a general Deſcription of Hope. We don't hope for what we now enjoy; nor for any Thing which is not in our Eſteem Good; nor for what we think, it is impoſſible we ſhould ever obtain. For altho' we might with for a good Thing which we are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible cannot be obtain'd. Yet we can't be faid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to hope for it. And if our Endeavours to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain what we deſire and hope for, are not included in Hope, yet they are excited by it.</p>
            <p>Now the Hope intended in my Text (as I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it) and which I am now to conſider; is—the Hope that we ſhall hereafter enjoy, all thoſe glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Things which <hi>Chriſt</hi> has purchaſed; and <hi>God</hi> has in the Covenant of Grace mercifully promiſed to his <hi>choſen</hi> People; even the Favour of <hi>God,</hi> and the full Viſion and Enjoyment of him; and ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and everlaſting Happineſs and Glory, Or a firm Expectation that we perſonally ſhall be brought in the World to come (being conformed to the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God) to partake of that Fulneſs of Joys
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005029_0007_100E689622570FB8"/>
which is in his Preſence, and thoſe Rivers of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which flow at his right Hand for evermore. And to flatter our ſelves with ſuch an Hope and Expectation, and after all, to find ourſelves diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, is a Thought which may juſtly fill us with Concern of Soul.</p>
            <p>Now that I may be the better underſtood, I would obſerve that even ſuch as are not yet converted and brought into Chriſt; eſpecially if they are under Convictions, may ſo far have Hope of this great Happineſs; that if they are now up and doing work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out their own Salvation with Fear and Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, if they conſcienciouſly and diligently attend and improve all the Means of Grace which God has appointed, cheriſh their Convictions, &amp; ſtrive with all their Might: and ſo wait on God. I ſay if they do ſo, they may hope that God will, of his rich and free Grace, through Chriſt, work his whole Work in them and the Work of Faith with Power; that he will give them a true ſaving Faith in Chriſt, and unſeigned Repentance of Sin; that he will convert them and that they ſhall upon their Repentance and cloſing with Chriſt, become in titled to eternal Life and Salvation, and as this ſhould ſupport ſuch and keep them from Deſpair; ſo it ought to excite them to the moſt diligent ſeeking and ſtriving to obtain Grace and Mercy.</p>
            <p>But the Believer has an Hope different from this. He hopes that God has already of his rich and free Grace, thro' Chriſt and by his Holy Spirit, wrought in his Heart thoſe Things upon which he is now become intitled to all theſe glorious Things, that he is become a <hi>Child of God</hi> and ſo an <hi>Heir of God and joint Heir with Chriſt to that Inheritance which fades not away,</hi> Rom. 8. 17.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:005029_0008_100E6898A6FA5908"/>But in as much as ſome that do thus hope they are in the Way to eternal Life may be deceived, it may be proper to conſider the Foundation on which our Hopes of Happineſs hereafter muſt be laid, ſo that it may be ſure and <hi>not make us aſhamed</hi>: with ſome of the Fruits and Properties of it.</p>
            <p>And here, I would ſay, the Grace, Mercy and Goodneſs of God, is the firſt Foundation of our Hope of Happineſs in the World to come, from this Originates our Hope of Salvation. The whole of that glorious Contrivance of the Salvation of Sinners ariſes and flows from the Mercy of God; which moved him to compaſſionate our Miſery, and ſat his infinite Wiſdom on Work, to contrive and bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a Method, (every Way agreeable to his adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Excellencies, Perfections and Attributes) for our Salvation.</p>
            <p>Indeed it is of the free, rich Grace and Mercy of God that we are ſaved. Every Thing that is done by God in Order to our Salvation: and Salvation itſelf flows from free Grace. Eph. 2.8. <hi>By Grace are ye ſaved through Faith, and that not of yourſelves it is the Gift of God.</hi> But then it would nevertheleſs be unſafe to hope for eternal Life, meerly becauſe, God is merciful, they that are in eternal Miſery will never be happy although God is a Being of infinite; Mercy, no! he is inexorable to all their Crys and Lamentations. We may by no Means depend on the uncovenanted Mercy of God.</p>
            <p>If ever we obtain ſaving Grace and Mercy it muſt be in God's own Way, in that Method in which all his divine Attributes and Perfections will be glorified and which is revealed to us in the Goſpel, in which Life and Immortality are brought to Light.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:005029_0009_100E689A28E836B8"/>And this is only in and by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt and in the Covenant of Grace, and ſo agreeable to the Promiſes of God in the Covenant, which are in Chriſt Yea and Amen. Although God be infinitely merciful, although he be in and through Chriſt the Father of Mercies and God of all Grace and Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and in him is reconciling the World to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; yet out of Chriſt he is a conſuming Fire, and will by no Means clear the Guilty, and it is in vain for us, to hope to obtain Mercy unleſs we ſeek it in that Way in which alone God is pleaſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow it, and therefore it appears, that it is the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt, it is his Obedience, Sufferings, and Interceſſion, that is the Foundation on which we muſt build our Hopes of obtaining the Mercy of God to everlaſting Life; and this alſo in the Way of the Covenant of Grace, and agreeable to the moſt gracious Promiſes in it.</p>
            <p>And then further the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt muſt be made our own, that is it muſt be imputed to us, and we muſt be made Partakers of his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, by the Application of them to us by the Holy Spirit, in Order to our Juſtification and Salvation; And we muſt become intitled to the Mercies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in the Covenant. For although there is a full and happy Proviſion made for Sinners in Chriſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be a Covenant of Grace made with Believers in him, and exceeding great and precious. Promiſes; yet if we never come to Chriſt, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him by Faith ſo as to be united to him; if we don't acquieſee in the Way of Salvation by him, and receive him on his own Terms: If we don't come into the Covenant of Grace, and lay hold on the Promiſes. What Benefit and Advantage will all this be of to us? <hi>He that believeth not ſhall be damned,</hi> Mark 16. 16. If Chriſt be the chief of ten
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005029_0010_100E689CAF0FAB20"/>
Thouſand and altogether lovely; yet if we can't ſay with the Spouſe, Cant. 2. 16. <hi>My Beloved, is mine and I am his.</hi> How ſhall we be the better for him? Although there be Merit enough in Chriſt for the Salvation of all that will come to him; yet can we expect to partake of his Merits, and Benefits, unleſs we come to him in his own Way therefor?</p>
            <p>Still further, however gracious God is, whatever Proviſion is made for us in Chriſt, and in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; yet ſince <hi>no unholy Thing can enter into Heaven</hi> Rev. 21. 27. And <hi>without Holineſs no Man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12. 14. It will follow hence that we, who are by Nature unholy, impure, and defiled, and Children of Wrath; muſt be converted, changed, renewed and ſanctified, in Order to our obtaining that Heaven of Happineſs, which we hope for: And in Order to our being renewed and ſanctified by the bleſſed Spirit, (who is God that ſanctifies us) we muſt be, (by the ſame Holy Spirit,) enlightned in the Things of God, convinced of the evil and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed Nature of Sin, as it is againſt the Nature, Attributes and Perfections of God, and a Violation of his Law, and a dreadful Abuſe of his unequalled Mercy and Grace, many Ways diſcovered to us; but eſpecially in giving us ſuch a glorious Saviour: And alſo of our own perſonal Guilt, that we ourſelves are the very Perſons who are guilty. And we muſt be brought to a real unſeigned Hatred of all and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Sin, conſidered as Sin; and to a real Converſion or turning from Sin unto God.</p>
            <p>Agreeably, having obſerved theſe Things, I may proceed to ſay, in order to lay the Foundation of our Hope of future Happineſs and Salvation, deep and ſure, and to have ſuch an <hi>Hope as we ſhall not be aſhamed of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:005029_0011_100E68A0427C94D8"/>We muſt come to be well ſatisfied and aſſured, that we have been enabled to comply with the Terms on which Salvation is promiſed. In a few Words, here, more particularly,</p>
            <p>They that have a good and well grounded Hope, that they are now Heirs to Glory; are ſuch as have good Reaſon to be ſatisfied, that they have been tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and really convinced of Sin; and been brought to an hearty Sorrow for it, that they have in them a real Hatred of all Sin, as Sin, that they have truly repented of all and every Sin and that a real Change is wrought in them, that they are <hi>turned from Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Light, and from the Power of Satan to the living God.</hi> That <hi>old Things are paſſeed away</hi> in them and <hi>all Things are become new,</hi> that they are <hi>born again</hi> and <hi>created a new in Chriſt Jeſus unto good Works which God ordain'd that they ſhould walk in them.</hi> And that they have been enabled, by the Grace and Spirit of God (in Concurrance with their Endeavours) to cloſe with Chriſt on his own Terms; to come intirely out of themſelves, renouncing all Dependance on their own Righteouſneſs, or any Thing that they can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly do to receive Chriſt as their Prophet, Prieſt and King, as their <hi>Lord</hi> as well as <hi>Chriſt</hi>; and ſo to put over all the Concerns of their precious and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Souls into his Hands. And <hi>that their Hearts are purified by Faith</hi> and their <hi>Faith works by Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whoever has a well-grounded. Aſſurance of this, that theſe Things are wrought in and for him; has a good and ſure Hope of eternal Life and Salvation, he may lay hold on the Promiſes, (being united to Chriſt) and reſt ſatisfied in the never-failing Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of him that has promiſed: and ſo may go on his Way rejoicing. If our Hope be indeed built on theſe Principles, on this Foundation, we ſhall never be aſhamed of it,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:005029_0012_100E68A1C39A2E20"/>But that I may be as plain as poſſible, and that you may the better judge whether the Hope you now have be indeed well grounded. Conſider whether you find in you, the Fruits and Conſequents, and the diſtingiuſhing Properties of ſuch an Hope, or thoſe Things that accompany it; ſuch as theſe.</p>
            <p>Do you upon a ſerious and cloſe Examination, find that the Bent, Biaſs and Inclination of your Souls, and Minds are to God to Religion and Holineſs? Do you take Pleaſure in Meditating on God, his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perfections and on his Word, and in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him? Do you love his Houſe, Worſhip, Ordinances, and his Miniſters for their Work Sake; and the Image of God, and ſuch as bear his Image? <hi>We know we are paſſed from Death to Life becauſe we love the Brethren,</hi> 1 John 3. 14.</p>
            <p>And do you find that you have in you a true habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Hatred of Sin and of all Sin? Is there no darl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sin which you hug in your Boſoms, and ſecretly role as a ſweet Morſel under your Tongue?</p>
            <p>Again do your Hopes of Happineſs make &amp; keep you meek, humble, and lowly in Mind, ſo that in Meekneſs and Lowlineſs of Mind, you eſteem others better than your ſelves? They that have a good Hope will have this Temper of Mind, <hi>Meekneſſ, Love, Gentleneſs,</hi> and <hi>Goodnefs,</hi> are reckoned up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the genuine <hi>Fruits of the Spirit</hi> that dwells in Believers, Gal. 5. 22. We ſhall have great Reaſon to ſuſpect the Foundation of our Hope, if our Hope puffs us up, makes us proud, ſelf-conceited and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious. Of which more hereafter.</p>
            <p>Further, are you willing and deſirous to come to the Light, and to have the Foundation of your Hope thro'ly ſearch'd &amp; try'd? It is a very dark Sign, if we are backward and loath to truſt the Foundation of our Hope to Examination, that we our ſelves ſuſpect that
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005029_0013_100E68A4474367D0"/>
it is not good, and yet are too willing to be deceived. Our Saviour ſays John 3. 20, 21. <hi>For every one that doth Evil hateth the Light, neither cometh to the Light leaſt his Deeds ſhould be reproved. But he that doth Truth cometh to the Light, that his Deeds may be made manifeſt that they are wrought in God.</hi> We ſhould conſider therefore whether it be our hearty Deſire and Prayer, that God would diſcover us to ourſelves, and give us to know our true State and Condition, whatever Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs the Knowledge of it might now give us. Can we heartily pray as in 26 Pſal. 2. <hi>Examine me, O Lord, and prove me, try my Reins and my Heart.</hi> And 139th Pſalm 23, 24. <hi>Search' me, O God, and know my Heart, try me and know my Thoughts, and ſee if there be any wicked Way in me, and lead me in the Way ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let me add, do you find that the more you ſearch yourſelves and try the Grounds of your Hope, the better you are ſatisfied that your Hope is good? If ſo this is a good Token that your Hope is laid on a good Bottom.</p>
            <p>Still further, doth your Hope of Salvation quicken you, to cleanſe and purify yourſelves from all Sin, and Uncleanneſs, make you more earneſt in your En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to be holy in Heart and Life? This is an eſſential Property of a good Hope, 1 John 3.3. <hi>And every Man that hath this Hope in him purifieth himſelf e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as he is pure.</hi> If your Hope be a good and well-grounded Hope you will find that it will excite and ſtir you up to labour and ſtrive to be more and more holy and pure, more religious and virtuous, to be more like God.</p>
            <p>You will not then reſt in a bare ſlender Hope but will be <hi>giving all Diligence to make your Calling and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection ſure.</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 10. They that think low De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Grace eno', and that if they once come to
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005029_0014_100E68A5EC382120"/>
have ſome Hope of Happineſs it is ſufficient, or that they have already attained Grace enough to carry them to Heaven and ſo are eaſy; have great Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to fear they have no Grace at all. Grace is of a growing Nature; Prov. 4. 18. <hi>The Path of the juſt is as the ſhining Light, that ſhineth more and more unto the perfect Day.</hi> And every one that has a good Hope will find ſome ſuch Temper in him as the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes in Phil. 3. 12. V and on, which read. They that have Grace will deſire more and never think they have enough of it here.</p>
            <p>I would juſt add further here, doth your Hope of Salvation, make you rejoice more in Communion with God, and in the Manifeſtations of his Favour, than in the outward Gifts of his Providence? This, the Pſalmiſt mentions 4th Pſal. 6, 7. <hi>There be many that ſay, who will ſhew us any Good? Lord, lift thou up the Light of thy Countenance upon us. Thou haſt put Gladneſs in mine Heart, more than in the Time that their Corn and their Wine increaſed.</hi> The clearer our Hopes and Views of heavenly Joys are, the leſs will our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of and Love to earthly Things be. And the clearer our Evidences are that we are converted and in the Way to Happineſs, the greater will be our Joy and Comfort. Our Comfort will ariſe in Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to the Evidence we have that our Hopes are well-grounded.</p>
            <p>It ſhould be obſerved here, that ſuch as have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a good Hope, may ſometimes be under Clouds and Darkneſs, they that <hi>fear the Lord and obey the Voice of his Servant</hi> may be left to <hi>walk in Darkneſs and ſee no Light,</hi> 50th Iſai. 10. And <hi>the Comforter that ſhould relieve their Souls</hi> may be <hi>far from them,</hi> Lam. 1. 16. And this may ariſe ſometimes partly from bodily Indiſpoſitions; more commonly from the Careleſſneſs of ſuch, they being off their Guard, and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005029_0015_100E68A89F4F1F18"/>
ſo expoſed to and overcome by Temptations: And falling into ſome Sins which grieve the Holy Ghoſt and cauſe their <hi>Beloved to withdraw,</hi> Cant. 5. 2.—A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, this may ariſe in ſome, partly from comparing their Experiences and Grounds of Hope, more with thoſe of others; than with the Rules in the Word of God. If Perſons don't find in themſelves thoſe Things which ſome others tell them they have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced; although upon a full Examination they may have as good Reaſon of their Hope; yet this may cauſe Doubts to ariſe even in the Heart of a Believer. And it muſt be ſaid we need the Aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt, in examining the Grounds of our Hope, and to enable us to ſee our true State, and to <hi>witneſs with our Spirit that we are the Children of God,</hi> Rom. 18.17. And we ſhall not clearly ſee the Foundation (which may be laid in us) to hope for Happineſs, without the Help of the Spirit, ſo as to have <hi>no Doubts</hi>; but if after all, in your dark Hours, you find your <hi>Hearts wake</hi> like the Spouſe's forementioned Cant. 5. 2. And your <hi>Hope is as the Anchor of your Souls</hi>: Which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports and bears you up under all your Diſtreſſes and Difficulties, and you have the Witneſs of your own Spirits, that your Hope is built on the Foundation I have above mentioned, you may be ſatisfied it is a good Hope.</p>
            <p>There are other Marks in Scripture (agreeable to theſe) by which you may try the Foundation of your Hope; but I believe if you carefully and impartial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and frequently examine yourſelves by what has been ſaid, you may come to a ſatisfactory Concluſion, whether you have ſuch an Hope as will not make you <hi>aſhamed</hi> or not.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only add, if we could be fully ſatisfied in this important Point, we muſt be frequent, ſerious and impartial in our Self-Examination and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005029_0016_100E68AB23303978"/>
ourſelves with the Marks of true Believers; we muſt be conſtant in the Uſe of Means ; and we muſt be much in Prayer to God, to aſſiſt us herein, and to diſcover to us what Foundation of Hope we have ; and to give us the Teſtimony of his Spirit with ours, that we are his Children, and have a good Hope, and if we obtain this, we ſhall have <hi>Joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable, and full of Glory.</hi> But this will receive fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Light from the Conſideration of that Hope which will make ſuch as have it aſhamed. To which I now (as I propoſed) proceed.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, I am to conſider, <hi>What that ill-grounded and falſe Hope is, of which, ſuch as have it, ſhall be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and ſome of the Properties of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this being contrary to this good Hope, you may very much judge what it is, by what has been already ſaid, for they illuſtrate each other. So that I need but little more than repeat ſome Things which have been already mentioned; and ſhow that that Hope which is founded on Things contrary thereto, or very different therefrom is a falſe Hope and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out good Grounds.</p>
            <p>It is an awful and awakening Conſideration, that ſo many hope for Happineſs without any good Ground and Foundation. Their Hope is no better than a vain Preſumption. And if ſuch could ſee what their Condition really is, and how groundleſs their Hope, now; as they will (if not before) when it will be forever too late to rectify the dreadful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake: It might ſerve to excite them to endeavour after a better Hope. That many do deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with a vain Hope is very plain from what I have before ſaid, and from Job 11. 20. <hi>But the Eyes of the wicked ſhall fail, &amp; they ſhall not eſcape &amp; their Hope ſhall be as the giving up of the Ghoſt.</hi> And Job 18.14. <hi>His Confidence ſhall be rooted out of his Tabernacle, and it
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005029_0017_100E68ADAAC29C08"/>
ſhall bring him to the King of Terrors.</hi> 27 Chap. 8 v. <hi>For what is the Hope of the Hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his Soul</hi>? It is ſuppoſed here (you ſee) that Perſons may have an Hope of Happineſs and yet periſh, and oh how dreadful will this be! Let this Conſideration awaken your Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to what may be ſaid in ſhowing what a falſe Hope is, and excite you to ſee to it that you be not deceived by ſuch an Hope. And that you may be the better able to judge whether your Hopes of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs be not built on ſome falſe Foundation: I ſhall offer a few Things under this Head to your ſerious Conſideration. Such as</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>If our Hope of Happineſs is built on the Mercy of God, conſider'd ſeparately from the Merits of Chriſt and the Covenant of Grace it is a falſe Hope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is to be feared that too many hope to be happy hereafter, only becauſe, they think God is merciful and gracious; all the Foundation of their Hope is the <hi>uncovenanted Mercy</hi> of God. But this is no good Foundation; for altho'our Hopes of Happineſs are founded on the Mercy and Grace of God, yet (as I have before ſhown) it is thro' the Merits of Chriſt, and in the Way of the Covenant of Grace. It is thro' Chriſt and in Covenant that we may hope for eternal Mercy. It is preſumption to hope for Salvation without Chriſt, and unleſs we receive it in the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of the Covenant and Promiſes of God in it. To hope for Mercy, therefore, without any Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, the Covenant of Grace and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, is to hope without good Grounds.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, <hi>Our Hope of Salvation, while we have, no Reaſon to think we have an Intereſt in Chriſt, that we are in the Covenant of Grace, and ſo intitled to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Salvation and Happineſs; is without a good Foundation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:005029_0018_100E68AF8E94BA20"/>The Mercy of God, the Merits of Chriſt, and the exceeding great and precious Promiſes of the Goſpel, will be of no further Advantage to us than we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come intereſted therein.</p>
            <p>I am afraid many build their Hope of Heaven and Happineſs upon this, that there is Mercy in God, Merits enough in Chriſt, and many gracious Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the Word of God; but never carefully enough examine to ſee, whether they themſelves, have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd with thoſe Terms upon which they become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to any of them. They don't (as they ſhould do) carefully and throughly enough examine, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they have intirely come out of themſelves and renounc'd all Dependance on themſelves, and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied themſelves of all Confidence, in their own Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, or Righteouſneſs, whether they don't depend on their Faith (as a Work by which they merit) or their Repentance or Morality; And whether they have with their whole Heart embraced the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in all his Offices, as their Prophet, Priests, and King, as their whole and alone Saviour. And yet whether they have any good Reaſon to hope they have done theſe Things (by the Help of the Spirit) or no, they vainly flatter themſelves they are in the Way to be ſaved by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I muſt (in Faithfulneſs) tell you, Brethren, that whatever other Foundation of Hope you may flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter yourſelves you have; yet if you are ſtill Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, if you have never cloſed with and embrac'd the Lord Jeſus Chriſt on his own Terms, if you have never heartily laid hold on the Covenant of Grace and given up yourſelves in it, and ſo have not laid hold on the Promiſes by Faith; your Hope is not built on a good and ſure Foundation, and you may expect to be aſhamed of it at laſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>If you are not truly converted and born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005029_0019_100E68B215A36DC0"/>
gain, if you are not become new Creatures, and yet hope you are now in the Way to Salvation, your Hope is vain and groundleſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Except a Man be born again, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> ſays our Saviour, John 3.3. and the Apoſtle ſpeaks to the ſame Purpoſe, 2 Cor. 5. 17. <hi>If any Man be in Chriſt Jeſus be is anew Creature, old Things are done away in him, and behold all Things are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>become new.</hi> Now unleſs we find theſe Things in us what Grounds of Hope can we have? Every Change doth not lay a good Foundation of Hope. A Man may be very greatly changed in his outward Converſation, and experience ſome Change in his Heart; and yet never feel, never experience an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Change in his Heart, Soul, andi whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. A Perſon may be under very ſtrong Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and be brought to ſee Things, in ſome Meaſure different from what he did before; and may have a conſiderable Change wrought in him: he may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake many Sins, and comply with many Duties out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly; and yet all this while never have his Heart really changed, nor his Mind renewed He may not have any true Hatred of Sin, conſidered as Sin; for then he would hate all Sin. Nay he may have ſome joy and ſeeming Pleaſure in Things of Religion. And what he may miſtake for the <hi>Joy of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and yet have no true, hearty Love to God, and our Saviour, nor perform any Duties from a Principle of Love to God, Hatred of Sin, Faith in Chrirſt, and Obedience to God. But this is no good Hope. It may be juſt obſerved here, that although Faith in Chriſt, and Repentance of Sin (which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in this Converſion) be very different in their own Nature, yet they are never ſeparated in a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; he that believes aright in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, repents of his Sins, and is converted: And ſo on the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005029_0020_100E68B4AB939BF0"/>
contrary. And Repentance and this true real Change in our Hearts, (which will influence our Lives, of which hereafter) is neceſſary to be found in us, in order to our having a good Hope of Salvation. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Converſion we can't be happy hereafter. I am ſenſible the Work of Sanctification will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in this Life; but yet it muſt be here begun; and you muſt be ſanctified (if not perfectly here) yet throughout, in every Part, Power, and Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of your Souls; you muſt be <hi>wholly,</hi> that is in every part <hi>ſanctified, and your whole Spirit, Soul, and Body</hi> muſt be <hi>preſerved blameleſs</hi> (in ſome Meaſure) <hi>unto the Coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5. 2, 3.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Doth the Hope you have of Salvation and Happineſs make and keep you humble, meek and lowly? If not, you have Reaſon to fear it is no better than the Hope of an Hypocrite.</p>
            <p>A true and well-grounded Hope, has always this Fruit and Effect that it humbles the Soul that has it, a good Foundation of Hope can't be in the ſame Soul, where Pride and Self-Conceit, eſpecially ſpiritual Pride is cheriſhed and reigns. He that has a good Hope will be ready in Meekneſs and Lowlineſs of Mind to eſteem others better than himſelf: But a falſe Hope, the Hope of an Hypocrite is apt to puff Men up with Pride, Vain-Glory, and Self-Conceit; they that have ſuch an Hope, are apt to eſteem themſelves bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than others; to proclaim their own Goodneſs, and to deſpiſe, judge and cenſure others. Think not that I ſpeak this of myſelf without Authority, for faith not the Scripture the ſame Things, what leſs doth our Saviour teach us in the Account he gives us of ſuch a Phariſee in Luke 18. 10. and on, <hi>The Phariſee ſtood and prayed thus with himſelf, God I thank thee, that I am not as other Men are, Extortioners, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:005029_0021_100E68B7320D7230"/>
Adulterers or even as this Publican;</hi> How he boaſts of himſelf and deſpiſes his Neighbour! <hi>Charity is not puffed up,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 4. Nor doth it <hi>envy</hi> others nor <hi>vaunt itſelf.</hi> If your Knowledge and ſpiritual Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences and Hope of Happineſs which you pretend to, make you proud, and to think highly of your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and meanly of others, and if they make you uncharitably to any; you have great Reaſon to fear yours is no better Hope and built on no better Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, than the Hope of this Phariſee, and yet our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour tells us the Publican he ſo much deſpiſed was ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified rather than he. The great God ſpeaking of ſuch as ſay to others, <hi>Stand by thyſelf, come not near to me, for I am holier than thou,</hi> ſays, <hi>theſe are a Smoak in my Noſe, a Fire that burneth all Day</hi>: And threatens to reward them accordingly, 65 Iſai. 5, 0.</p>
            <p>Once more 5thly, <hi>If your Hope doth not purify you, and quicken you to do all you can to be free from all Sin, all Pollution both in Heart and Life; you have Reaſon to fear it is without Ground.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we would evidence to ourſelves and others that our Hope of Salvation is built on a ſure Foundation, we muſt do it by bringing forth <hi>Fruits, meet for Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> Matth. 3. 8. An unholy Heart and Life can't be conſiſtent with a good Hope.</p>
            <p>A good Divine<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Mead.</note> ſays, you may hope for Heaven, while you are doing the Work of Hell: you may hope for Salvation while you are working out your own Damnation; you may hope in God, and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver chooſe him for your Portion. A good Hope pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies the Heart (as you have heard) and will excite us to endeavour to have a <hi>pure Heart, and clean Hands.</hi> 24.

<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005029_0022_100E68B903B72430"/>
the Things of this World. This World and the Things of it will appear vain and trifling in the Eyes of him who has a good Hope of the infinitely grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and better Things of another. He that has this Hope will diſapprove every Thing that tends to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Coming to enjoy what he hopes for, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove every Thing that may help him forward to the Enjoyment of the deſired Good, but to enlarge no further (although more might be ſaid here) I have endeavoured to ſhow you how you may in ſome good Meaſure know, whether the Foundation which you build your Hopes of Salvation upon be good or no. And ſo whether you ſhall be likely to be aſhamed of your <hi>Hope</hi> or not. And I hope what has been ſaid may be of Service to ſatisfy you herein. And this may ſuffice for the firſt Thing I propoſed to conſider under the Doctrine. I proceed now to the ſecond, Viz.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>To offer ſome Conſiderations, for the Proof of the Doctrine, and to convince us, of the Neceſſity of our ſtriving and praying that we may all have an Hope of Salvation, on ſuch good Grounds, as that we ſhall not be aſhamed of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Pſalmiſt without Doubt had as good and well grounded an Hope, as any of us have or can expect to have here; and yet you ſee, he (in the Text) prays to God that he might <hi>not be aſhamed of his Hope.</hi> And as he pray'd for this, ſo, doubtleſs, he alſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd in the Uſe of proper Means, to have his Hope ſo well-grounded that he might not be aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of it at Death, at the Judgment and in the coming World. The Doctrine then naturally ariſes from die Text.</p>
            <p>And without Doubt it is of great Concern to us all, to labour, ſtrive, and pray; that we may have ſuch
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:005029_0023_100E68BB8E5F94A8"/>
an Hope as ſhall not make us aſhamed: as moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly all ſuch Hopes will, as are not laid on a good and ſure Foundation. The Text plainly ſuppoſes an Hope that will be diſappointed. And the wiſe Man obſerves, Prov. 10. 28. <hi>The Hope of the Righteous ſhall be Gladneſs; but the Expectation of the Wicked ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</hi> And if <hi>Hope deferred maketh the Heart ſick; but when, the Deſire cometh it is a Tree of Life</hi>? As Prov. 13. 12. How dreadful will be the Shame and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of thoſe who hope for Happineſs and Salvation after Death and yet ſhall find themſelves diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed!</p>
            <p>But it may be proper, under this Head, to give ſome Reaſons of the Doctrine, or Motives to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite us to labour and pray for a good Hope, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral important Reaſons may be briefly offered.</p>
            <p>And beſides what is ſaid in our Text, and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Texts as ſhow this to be our Duty and Intereſt, I would further offer the following Things to Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, ſome of which may excite our Fear, others our Hope, and Endeavours. Viz.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>We ſhould labour and pray that we may have a good Hope, becauſe, if we don't, we ſhall be in great Danger of having a falſe and ill-grounded Hope which we ſhall be aſhamed of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Thoughts of eternal Torment, are ſo ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: that few, if any, can bear them; hence moſt, if not all Men, find ſomething or other, as a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Hope to eſcape this; and it is greatly to be feared, that the greater Part of Mankind, have a bad Foundation of Hope. And even thoſe that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the greateſt Priviledges and make the higheſt Profeſſion of Religion, are in Danger of this; unleſs they with much Care and Prayer lay the Foundation: at firſt, deep and ſure, and then alſo often ſearch the Foundation, to ſee if it be indeed ſuch as will not
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:005029_0024_100E68BE1072DC78"/>
fail. We read of ſome chat have <hi>made Shipwrack of Faith, and a good Conſcience.</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 19. And the very Poſſibility of ſuch a Thing, ſhould quicken us to the greateſt Care that we be not like them. It is not ſo eaſy a Matter to gain ſuch a good Hope, as we ſhall with for hereafter, as ſome may think it is, there are too many <hi>build this on the Sand,</hi> to allude to that of our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 24. and on. There are many falſe and unſafe Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations on which Men build their Hopes: And we have Hearts in us naturally, which are <hi>deceitful above all Things and deſperately wicked.</hi> Jer. 17. 9. We have alſo a very ſubtle Devil, who without Doubt doth all he poſſibly can, to prevent our laying a good Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Hope, becauſe ſo long as he can keep us from this, he has much Reaſon to think he ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy us. He is very willing we ſhould hope for Happineſs provided our Hope be on a falſe Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—Hence it appears, that unleſs we are very careful, diligent and prayerful, we ſhall be in great Danger of a falſe Hope. It requires much Study, much Meditation, and cloſe Examination to lay a good Foundation of Hope If you only reflect and conſider what I have before mentioned as good Grounds of Hope, you will ſee, that unleſs we ſtrive labour and uſe all appointed Means, there will be no Reaſon to expect a good Bottom to build our Hopes upon, we muſt believe, repent, be converted and born again, in order to our having good Reaſon to hope that we ſhall partake of the ſaving Grace and Mercy of God through Chriſt. And ſurely if we will not labour to lay a good Foundation of Hope we can't expect it. And then we never can have a ſure and good Ground of Hope unleſs the Foundation be laid in us by the Holy Spirit, working the Work of God in us. Which ſhews us the Neceſſity of our
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:005029_0025_100E68BF9260A6A0"/>
praying to God for the Spirit. Let me add here, as there is Need of our Endeavours and Prayers in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to have a good Ground of Hope; ſo there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, in order to our ſeeing and knowing this that ſo we may have the Comfort of it. <hi>We ſhould give all Diligence to make our Calling and Election ſure.</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 10. And as we greatly need the Aſſiſtance of the Spirit, in our Self-Examination, and to <hi>witneſs with our Spirits,</hi> ſo we muſt ſeek him of God, if we would obtain ſuch a Priviledge. We have no ſufficient Ground to expect to have a good Foundation of Hope, nor a comfortable Senſe thereof; unleſs we labour and pray therefor. But I proceed to conſider,</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>We ſhould labour and pray that we may have a good and well-grounded Hope; becauſe of the great Diſadvantages, and infinite Danger there is in having a falſe Hope, which will make us aſhamed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is not only Danger, that we ſhall reſt in a falſe Hope; but there is as much or more Danger of us, if it ſhould be our unhappy Condition to build our Hopes on the Sand, and to ſatisfy ourſelves with an Hope that will deceive us.</p>
            <p>There are ſome Perſons, who never had any great Advantages to know any Thing of Religion, and the Way and Method of Salvation, by Jeſus Chriſt, (which is the only Way:) and others although they have had the great Priviledges of the Goſpel; yet never had any Awakenings and Convictions; but the meer Convictions of natural Conſciences, and this has been ſo bribed and blinded by their prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Luſts and Temptations and the Deceitfulneſs of Sin; that they have never fixed on any Foundation of Hope, which, upon the leaſt Reflection and Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination can be thought good. They may hope for Mercy on Account of this, they think God is graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and merciful, and will not, did not make Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:005029_0026_100E68C368114B30"/>
on Purpoſe to make them miſerable; and ſo ſatisfy themſelves. Now there is great Danger of ſuch as theſe; eſpecially if they have enjoy'd good and powerful Means of Grace, and continued long in this Caſe and contracted Habits of Vice and Sin. <hi>Can the Etheopian change his Skin, or the Leopard his Spots? Then may ye alſo do good that are accuſtomed to do Evil.</hi> It is no eaſy Thing to bring ſuch to Conviction and Repentance and ſo to lay a good Foundation of Hope.</p>
            <p>But then there are others who are or have been under powerful Awakenings and Convictions, the Word of God has been ſet home with Power on their Hearts; ſo that they are convinced that ſuch Things as they hitherto reſted in, are by no Means any good Foundation to rely on. Now if ſuch as theſe come, after this, again to fix upon any other falſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe Foundation of Hope; their Danger will be even greater than the others, nay inexpreſſible. This I take to be plainly taught in that of our Lord. Mat. 21. 31, 32. <hi>Jeſus ſaith unto them that the Publicans and the Harlots go into the Kingdom of God before you, for John came unto you in a Way of Righteouſneſs, and ye believed him not: but the Publicans and the Harlots believed him,</hi> &amp;c. Their having had ſuch Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and too much truſted to them, made it the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to unhinge them, and bring them to ſee that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they had no good Ground of Hope.</p>
            <p>And having obſerved this I may proceed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider more particularly the Danger of having an ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded Hope, and the Danger of this may be conſidered as it reſpects this Life and that to come, although what may be ſaid as to the firſt, terminates in the other World.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſhall conſider <hi>this Danger as to this Life, while we are Probationers for another.</hi> And under this Head I may ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:005029_0027_100E68C4EA89E098"/>1. <hi>If Perſons come to have a fixed Hope of future Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and Salvation, upon an unſafe Foundation,</hi> (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially after great Advantages and Illuminations and after they have been brought off from ſome former falſe Grounds of Hope) <hi>there is very great Danger that they will never be undeceiv'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is no eaſy Matter, to bring, even thoſe, that have lived all their Days in Sin, and have done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſecure the Favour of God through Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo have no Grounds at all to hope for Happineſs; to ſee the Evil of their Ways and the Danger they are in of periſhing; eſpecially, if to their own Corruptions there be added a bad Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and ſinful Examples, and ſuch as tempt Men, to neglect the Concerns of their Souls.</p>
            <p>Men are apt to be fond of, and partial to their own Ways of thinking; and the Ways in which they have been brought up; hence we have that Direction, <hi>Train up a Child in the Way wherein be ſhould go</hi>; and this Reaſon is given for it, becauſe <hi>when he is old be will not depart from it.</hi> Prov. 22. 6. We ſee ſome Perſons although they are favoured with all Goſpel-Priviledges, and have much Pains taken with them, &amp; altho' they can't but know (if they would conſider it) that they are in an unconverted Eſtate, and ſo have no good Foundation to hope for Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; yet going on from Year to Year, in a tho'tleſs unconcerned Way, as if they were ſure of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs after Death.</p>
            <p>It is hard to bring ſome ſuch to a Senſe of their Sinfulneſs and miſerable Condition. But if they are brought to ſee ſomething of their undone and loſt Eſtate while in this Condition; to ſee their Sins and that if they continue as they are, they muſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh: and after this, by any Means they come to reſt upon ſome other falſe and unſafe Foundation of
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:005029_0028_100E68C7715666D0"/>
Hope; after they have been under powerful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, and after they have taken ſome Pains to fix on a good Bottom; it will be more difficult to convince them of their Miſtake and bring them to lay a good Foundation of Hope, than it was before. When Perſons are come to fix their Thoughts after ſome Pains taken; they are uſually very Tenacious of their own Thoughts; and if you tell them that after all that they have done, and that they hope they have experienc'd; they are yet without a good Hope, and will periſh if they don't get a better; it will be no eaſy Matter to make them believe it altho' ever ſo true. And you may inſtead of doing them any good, get a Blot to yourſelf, as they that reprove a Scorner do.</p>
            <p>And beſides this (if they have been led into Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes by the Injudiciouſneſs or Incorrectneſs of ſuch Preachers as they have admired) this will be likely to confuſe their Minds, they ſcarcely knowing what or who to believe; which will render it harder to undeceive them, and may have other very ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents with Reſpect to them.</p>
            <p>Experience ſhows us how difficult it is, to bring Men off from any ſmaller Miſtakes, when they are fixed in them; and conſidering the Subtilty of the great Enemy, and the Corruptions of our own Hearts, we may well ſuppoſe, it will be harder to perſuade Men to think that all they have been doing is to no Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and that they muſt go back to the very Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and do all anew. This is apt to ſhock them and make them ſtart back: and it will be well if it don't make ſome deſperately reſolve to continue as they are, even at all Hazzards.</p>
            <p>Now if we conſider this, it will appear to be a Matter of great Importance to every Soul to build their Hope of Salvation, on a ſure Foundation. And
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:005029_0029_100E68C8F2310B78"/>
if you find you have once been deceived and have had a falſe Hope, ſurely it highly concerns you now, to lay a good Foundation; and in order to this you muſt labour, uſe all proper Means and be much in Prayer. Let me juſt add here, we ſee hence how very careful Miniſters ought to be, to direct and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt People in Diſtreſs and under Convictions, to lay a good and ſure Foundation of Hope, a Miſtake in this may prove very prejudicial to Souls. But this muſt ſuffice for this Head.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>We ſhould ſtrive and pray that our Hope of Salvation may be on good Grounds; becauſe if our Hopes are built on a falſe Foundation, we ſhall be in Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of neglecting all Means and Endeavours to have a good Hope, and ſo ſhall be in Danger of periſhing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is Danger, not only, that ſuch will go on deceiving and being deceived; but if ſo they will be likely wholly to neglect all thoſe Things which are neceſſary in order to their having a good Hope and ſo to their Salvation. <hi>They that are whole, need not the Phyſician; but they that are ſick.</hi> If Perſons are come to this, that they are perſwaded they are in Chriſt, that they are converted and born again; they will by no Means uſe thoſe Means which they ought to uſe in order to obtain theſe Things.</p>
            <p>Although we can merit nothing at the Hands of God, by the moſt diligent Uſe of Means; yet God has appointed Means to be uſed by us, in order to our having a good Foundation of Hope. <hi>Faith comes by Hearing, and Hearing by tbe Word of God.</hi> Rom. 10.17. We muſt endeavour to <hi>work out our Salvation with Fear and Trembling,</hi> if we would have <hi>God work in us to will, and do of his own good Pleaſure.</hi> Phillip. 2. 12, 13. And ſurely if we flatter ourſelves that the Work of God be already wrought in us, and we are in the Way to Happineſs we ſhall be likely to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:005029_0030_100E68CB8589C150"/>
theſe Means, we ſhall not read, hear, nor pray as if we thought ourſelves without Hope. And if we indeed have no good Foundation of Hope; but are yet in our Sins, what infinite Danger ſhall we be in of being <hi>aſhamed of our Hope</hi> and of eternal Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And this leads me to the ſecond more general Head. Viz. To conſider</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>The dreadful and amazing Condition of ſuch as build their Hopes of Happineſs on a falſe Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the World to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At Death, when the Soul ſhall depart into the World of Spirits then it ſhall at once be convinced of the Falſenefs of the Foundation of it's paſt Hopes. Then their <hi>Hope ſhall make them aſhamed.</hi> When they find themſelves diſappointed of the Enjoyment of all they hoped for. The very Thought of this is, enough to fill us with Horror.</p>
            <p>Such as only dream of Happineſe hereafter, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have no Manner of Grounds to hope for it, and ſuch as go on in a bold Deſiance of the Wrath of God and eternal Miſery; will find when they come to experience what it is to be damned, that it is ſo much more dreadful and amazing than their moſt enlarged Thoughts could reach; that even their Diſappointment and Miſery will be diſtreſſing and amazing.</p>
            <p>But will not their Caſe be more miſerable, their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment more intolerable, who have had many great Advantages, many Strivings of the Spirit, and who have been brought near to the Kingdom of Heaven; but after all have wilfully, careleſly and wickedly all along neglected to lay a good Foundation of Hope.</p>
            <p>How amazing will it be to go to Hell full of the the Hopes of Heaven and Glory. Don't you think that the Diſappointment <hi>Haman</hi> met with was very
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:005029_0031_100E68CE0CDD3A68"/>
dreadful, who when he was full of Hopes of being advanced to die higheſt Honour and Grandure; and of obtaining his full Deſire on <hi>Mordecai, Eſther</hi> 7, found himſelf at once accuſed, and condemned and dragged away to a miſerable Death? But this was nothing at all to the ſurprizing and awful Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of ſuch as ſhall have their <hi>Hopes make them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed</hi> at Death; What Tongue can tell, what Heart conceive! The Horror, Shame, and Anguiſh that will fill the Souls of ſuch who ſhall find that they are for ever ſhut out of Heaven, and all Hopes of the leaſt Happineſs which they before hoped for, and inſtead of this they themſelves ſent down with Devils and damned Spirits into that Lake which burns with Fire and Brimſtone for ever. Is it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing to us to be diſappointed when we are big with Hopes and Expectations that we are juſt ready to enjoy ſome earthly Good? how much more tormenting, to be diſappointed and that for ever, of the expected Enjoyment of all poſſible Happineſs, and to endure all poſſible Miſery!</p>
            <p>Now from all theſe Conſiderations laid together, it will appear to be of the greateſt Concern to us, to endeavour and pray that we may have a well-groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Hope of Salvation. In theſe. Things I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to excite you to ſeek a good Hope, from Fear of the ill Conſequences of the contrary. It may be proper further to confirm the Doctrine, by addreſſing your Hope in ſome other Particulars, which will turn our Thoughts to much more pleaſant Meditations. And here,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>If you rightly endeavour and pay for a well-grounded Hope, and a comfortable Senſe of it you will be likely to obtain it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are not Things that cannot be obtained; many have and many (in this wonderful Day of
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:005029_0032_100E68D0923AAFE0"/>
Grace) do obtain them. And you have Reaſon to think you may alſo, if you ſeek them in a right Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. I can't but think that the Reaſon why ſo many have a falſe and ill-grounded Hope, is, in a great Meaſure, becauſe they don't take due Care to have a better. And the Reaſon ſo many are without a comfortable Aſſurance that they have a well-groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Hope, who indeed have good Grounds of Hope, is very much, becauſe they don't <hi>give all Diligence to make their Calling and Election ſure.</hi> The Text inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates that by proper Labour and Prayer we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch an Hope as we ſhall not be aſhamed of: in this Way many have obtained it, and in this Way we are directed to ſeek it; And this ſhould quicken us to die utmoſt Endeavours after ſuch an Hope, and the Evidences of it: And you have as much Encouragement to hope for Succeſs herein as others. But then if we would obtain this, we are not to think a few ſaint Wiſhes and heartleſs Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are ſufficient; it is a Matter of ſuch Importance, as to be worth all poſſible Endeavours, our whole Hearts and Lives are to be chiefly taken up in it. But further to excite you to labour and pray for ſuch a good Hope conſider the Advantages of it in this World and the other. Three Advantages may be mentioned which relate to this Life and World. As</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt <hi>A good Hope of future Happineſs will ſerve greatly to ſupport and comfort us under all the Afflictions we meet with in life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are here in a World of Sorrows and Troubles, and greatly need ſomething to ſupport and bear us up under them. Now if we have a good and well-grounded Hope that we are in Chriſt, and ſo that we Have the Love and Favour of God, and his Bleſſing
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:005029_0033_100E68D3187EB4C8"/>
and are in the Way to eternal life; this will be our greateſt Comfort and Support.</p>
            <p>When ſuch as are favoured with this Hope are under very heavy outward Afflictions, grievous and repeated Bereavements, or other Diſtreſs; to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that this, yea all Things are order'd out to us by our heavenly Father, our Covenant-God, to conſider his Covenant-Faithfulneſs, his infinite Perfections, and his gracious Promiſes that <hi>all Things ſhall work together for our Good,</hi> and that <hi>theſe light Afflictions which are but for a Moment, ſhall work out for us a far more exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory</hi>; and alſo <hi>that Tribulation worketh Patience, and Patience Experience, and Experience</hi> ſuch an <hi>Hope as ſhall not make us aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</hi> What greater and ſtronger Conſolation can we have under our outward Afflictions? Nay fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſuch as have comfortable Evidences of this Hope, ſometimes have the ſweet Incomes of the Holy Spirit, delightful Communion with God, and the moſt the ſenſible and reviving Manifeſtations of the Love and Favour of God to their Souls, while under outward Afflictions. Theſe Comforts are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways alike in thoſe that have a good Hope: But they that have not a good Hope of Salvation have no Grounds to expect them, any of them at all.</p>
            <p>I would further obſerve that this Hope will help to ſupport us under ſpiritual Trials and Diſtreſſes, which even ſuch may be in; this will greatly ſtren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gthen the Believer againſt the fierce Temptations and Aſſaults of the evil one, hence we are adviſed to <hi>put on the Hope of Salvation for an Helmet,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5. 8.</p>
            <p>This will ſupport us under a Senſe of our remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Corruptions and Imperfections; when we are aſleep this will keep our Hearts awake, and if, ur Beloved withdraw; it will awake us up to ſeek after him, till we find him.—<hi>Cant.</hi> 5. beginning.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:005029_0034_100E68D5AA794A80"/>They that have a real ſure Ground of Hope; will not in their Times of the greateſt Darkneſs and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions utterly loſe it, for any long Time; although <hi>in a little Wrath, God may hide his Face for a Moment! yet with everlaſting Kindneſs will be return, and have Mercy on them.</hi> Their <hi>Hope</hi> will be <hi>as an Anchor to the Soul,</hi> keeping it from ſinking when Waves and Billows paſs over it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>When we have good Evidences that our Hope is well-grounded, this gives us very great Joy, Peace and Comfort in this World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If our Hopes of Salvation be built upon a ſure and ſafe Foundation, it never will make us aſhamed; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we may not have ſuch clear and comforting Evidences of it. And I have no Doubt but ſome have really a good Hope of Salvation and yet are under Doubts as to the Foundation of their Hopes, and although ſometimes their Evidences of their good Eſtate are clear and bright, yet at other Times they may be more clouded, and leſs ſenſible.</p>
            <p>Now as the leaſt good Grounds to hope that we have an Intereſt in Chriſt, and ſo are in the Way to obtain Salvation will give us Joy and Comfort, ſo in Proportion, to the Degrees of Evidence of this, will our Pleaſure and Joy be. And when the Beliaver upon a due and proper Examination of himſelf, finds the Evidences that his Hope of Happineſs, is well-grounded, very bright and clear, and when the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God witneſſes with his Spirit that he is a Child of God; this will put greater Joy and Gladneſs into their Hearts, than the Increaſe of all outward good Things: Nay, it will give them <hi>Joy unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and full of Glory.</hi> And if ſuch Comfort and Joy be worth ſeeking, we ſhould labour for ſuch a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Hope from whence it proceeds,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:005029_0035_100E68D730FEF418"/>Thirdly, <hi>This good Hope will beſt ſupport us, under the Apprehenſions, Views and Approaches of Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Death will certainly, and may very ſuddenly, ſeize upon every one of us: and it is worth while to ſpend our whole lives in Endeavours, if thereby we may have a comfortable ſafe and happy Death; and Happineſs after it. And we never can have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable ſafe and happy Death, without a well-grounded Hope of Happineſs after it. I am ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Sinners may <hi>have no Bands in their Death:</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have no Hope of Salvation; yet they may be ſtupid and ſenſeleſs of their Danger: And ſo go out of the World without Fear. But how far is this from being an happy and ſafe Death! We can't die a ſafe and happy Death unleſs after Death we ſhall be happy; and this can't be unleſs the Foundation of it, be laid in this Life. And if our Salvation be ſecured, whether we have a clear View of it juſt before Death or no, yet we ſhall be happy. Sometimes Believers may have great Doubts and fiery Aſſaults of Satan a little before Death; I think it is not impoſſible but ſome may go doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of this World, to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom; nor is it at all improbable.</p>
            <p>But with what Calmneſs and Serenity of Soul may they, that, not only have a good and well-grounded Hope of Glory, but a lively Senſe alſo that their <hi>Hope will not make them aſhamed,</hi> look Death in the Face! He that is the King of Terrors to Sinners, is but a welcome Meſſenger to them, to carry them to the Enjoyment of thoſe glorions Things they hope for.</p>
            <p>Some, when God has, in the Hour of Death, lifted up the Light of his Countenance upon them, have had ſuch Viſions and Foretaſtes of Glory, ſuch bright and clear Diſcoveries of the Love of God
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:005029_0036_100E68D9B6928520"/>
to their Souls; and of their Intereſt in Chriſt; and Chriſt has appeared ſo lovely and glorious to them, that they have as it were, forgot the dark Entry they were to paſs thro' to go to Chriſt, their Souls ſeem impatiently (almoſt) to wait for his coming: and when the Moment comes, they as 'twere leap forth with unutterable Joy into his Arms.</p>
            <p>Thus have I ſeen (to the Glory of free &amp; rich Grace be it ſpoken) ſome few both <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> meet the King of Terrors, without Fear and with great Joy. And who at ſuch a joyful Sight would not cry out, <hi>Let me die the Death of the Righteous, and let my laſt End be like his?</hi> And who would not with all poſſible Diligence and Ardency of Soul labour and pray for ſuch an Hope, as will make their Death thus delightful. But it is Time, as this leads me, having thus conſidered ſome, (and but ſome) of the many Advantages of a good Hope in this Life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and at Death; that I in a few Words,</p>
            <p>2dly, Conſider, <hi>That this well-grounded Hope ſhall be ſwallowed up, in the full and perfect and everlaſting Enjoyment of all that we now hope for, yea and much more, after Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Altho there is not an End of Man at Death, but Eternity follows, yet all our preſent Hopes end with the Death of the Body. The Hope of the Hypocrite and Sinner then ends, and is turned into endleſs Deſpair, Horror and Miſery. And the Hope of the true Believer then ends, becauſe it is ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in the Enjoyment of all that he deſired, expected and hoped for! Rom. 8. 24. <hi>That which is ſeen why doth a Man yet hope for</hi>? Whatſoever the enlighten'd and ſanctified Soul wiſhes for or deſires, he ſhall fully and compleatly poſſeſs and enjoy after Death. They that have this good Hope, ſhall come <hi>to ſee as they are ſeen, to know</hi> (in their Meaſure) <hi>as
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:005029_0037_100E68DB6F364208"/>
they are known,</hi> they ſhall awake in the divine Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they ſhall be perfectly freed from all Sin, and Temptation to it, from Sorrow and Miſery and Fears thereof: and their enlarged Souls, with all their Faculties, ſhall be perfectly ſatisfied: They ſhall fully and without Interruption enjoy God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Son their dear and precious Redeemer, and the Spirit of all Grace and Comfort. God will be the ſatisfying Portion of their Souls forever.</p>
            <p>Let me juſt ſay here, the Souls of ſuch as have this Hope, ſhall be happy and bleſſed, while in their State of Separation from the Body; 'till the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of die Body. But as the enlarged Hopes of ſuch extend to the Reſurrection and beyond it, ſo their Bodies alſo ſhall ariſe <hi>glorious Bodies</hi> form'd and <hi>faſhion'd like to Chriſt's,</hi> Philip. 3.21. Their bleſſed Souls and Bodies being united, ſhall give up the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to God in the Judgment with exceeding great Joy. And after this they ſhall go away into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life.</p>
            <p>But why ſhould I further attempt, to deſcribe to you the Joy, Happineſs and Bleſſedneſs of ſuch, ſince <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, neither hath it entered into the Heart of Man,</hi> how exceeding great and glorious their Joy and Bleſſedneſs ſhall be, and this ſhall continue to all Eternity. Thus their <hi>Hope ſhall not make them aſhamed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, brethren, I have given ſome Reaſons why we ſhould labour and ſtrive with all our Powers, and pray with Ardency of Soul, that we may have a well-grounded Hope of Salvation, that will not make us aſhamed. And what can be offer'd, that will influence us Hereto, if theſe Things will not? And thus have I finiſhed what I propoſed for the Proof and Illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of the Doctrine. I proceed now to make
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:005029_0038_100E68DDF3282D18"/>
ſome IMPROVEMENT of what has been ſaid. And here</p>
            <p>Firſt, We infer <hi>the amazing Folly of ſuch as are either without any Hope of Salvation, or have a falſe Hope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I can't but fear there are too many ſuch; and what a dreadful Condition are they in? Conſider, that you are here but for a very little Time; you, are haſtening to an endleſs Eternity either of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs or Miſery; and as your Hope is here, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther well or ill grounded, ſo it will be with you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. And Oh conſider what infinite Happineſs you ſhall enjoy hereafter, if you now indeed ſee that your Hope be on a good Foundation: And on the other hand conſider how unſpeakably amazing it will be to find yourſelves aſhamed of your Hopes at laſt. Conſider what has been ſaid of theſe Things, and ſay, is it not the greateſt Folly and Stupidity, to reſt and be eaſy without a good and ſure Hope of eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and Salvation. They who have no Hope, and they who have no better than no Hope, and even thoſe who flatter themſelves they have a good Hope, although without any juſt Grounds, will be aſhamed of their Hopes at laſt. And Oh that it were poſſible to awaken your Conſciences now, ſo that you might ſee your Stupidity and Folly! Will you, can you calmly and deliberately go on in this Way which you know will end in eternal Torment! And dare any run the amazing Hazard of loſing their Souls, for Want of a due Care to lay a good Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hope!</p>
            <p>Secondly, Hence infer <hi>their Wiſdom and Happineſs who have</hi> (by the Grace of God) <hi>laid a good and ſure Foundation of Hope of eternal Salvation.</hi> Thrice hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py are they; <hi>all Things are theirs.</hi> They are truly happy here amidſt all their outward Afflictions, &amp; Sorrows,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:005029_0039_100E68E080A96B18"/>
yea nevertheleſs happy for them. Whether they have a certain and comfortable Aſſurance that their Hope is thus well-grounded or no, yet if it be they are happy, yea, their own Hearts can't conceive the Glory they are to poſſeſs hereafter.</p>
            <p>Now whatever it has coſt ſuch, how much Labour and Difficulties ſoever they have undergone, yet they have ſhown the greateſt Wiſdom, in that they have ſought till they have obtained ſuch an Hope.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall not enlarge here, but proceed to ſay,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Hence, <hi>Let us all examine ourſelves, to ſee what Foundation we have, for our Hopes of eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſee ſomething of the Danger of a falſe Hope, and the glorious Advantages of a true one. And let theſe Conſiderations quicken every Soul of us to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine ourſelves, without Delay and before it be too late, what Foundation of Hope we have.</p>
            <p>It is nothing leſſ than Heaven and Glory, than the eternal Happineſs and Salvation of our never-dying Souls, that we hope for. And O ſearch and try till you do really find what Foundation you have to hope for theſe glorious Things upon, ſearch deep, look to the very Bottom, ſee if the Foundation be laid ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and ſafe. A trifling Examination and ſearch, will ſignify very little. We ſhould be the more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in this Search and Examination becauſe there are ſo many falſe Foundations of Hope, and ſo much Danger of our being deceiv'd.</p>
            <p>Give me leave to ask you Brethren, and Oh! let your Hearts go with me, and ask your own Souls, ſuch Queſtions as theſe, Viz.</p>
            <p>Do you hope for Happineſs and Salvation, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe God is merciful and gracious, although your Conſciences tell you, you never comply'd with
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:005029_0040_100E68E307EDE070"/>
thoſe Things nor come into that Method, upon, and in which alone, you may expect his Mercy?</p>
            <p>Although a good Hope originates in the Mercy of God, (as I have ſhewn) yet to build our Hopes of Happineſs upon this, ſeparated from the Merits of Chriſt, and the Covenant of Grace; and when we can't but know, we never have done any Thing in order to obtain the Favour of God through Chriſt; is to build our Hopes on a wrong Foundation. God will not glorify his Grace and Mercy, to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of any other of his divine Attributes.</p>
            <p>Again, do you hope for Salvation, becauſe you enjoy the Means of Grace, have heard the beſt of Preaching; are born of truly religious Parents; have done ſome Duties; yea even come to the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Ordinances? All theſe Things are very great Priviledges, or Duties, and by no Means to be lightly thought or ſpoken of; but all theſe alone, unleſs you are brought to believe in Chriſt, repent of your Sinſ, and unleſs a real Change be wrought in your Hearts, will not give ſufficient Ground to hope for Salvation, as I might eaſily ſhew had I Time. Do you hope for Happineſs, becauſe others think and ſpeak well of you: Conſider ſo they may of the greateſt Hypocrites: <hi>For we cannot judge the Hearts of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, do you hope for Salvation, becauſe you have been greatly awakened, enlightened and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed? Conſider, Illumination and Convictions, although neceſſary to Converſion, may be where Converſion is not, there is a legal Sorrow for Sin as well as evangelical, which implies Conviction. Have not your Convictions ariſen only from a Senſe of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery! Let me ſeriouſly ask you, have you ever been convinced of the Evil &amp; accurſed Nature of Sin? has Sin ever appeared to you exceeding ſinful? Have you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:005029_0041_100E68E58D6F9728"/>
ſeen Sin as it is contrary to the Nature, Attributes; Perfections and Law of God? All Repentance and ſo all Convictions have Reſpect to God, againſt whom all Sin is committed. And it is very plain that the brighter Diſcoveries God makes of himſelf to any the more they will ſee of the evil Nature of Sin, and of their own Sinfulneſs, Vileneſs and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. See Job 42. 5, 6. <hi>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the Ear: but now mine Eye ſeeth thee. Wherefore I abhor myſelf and repent in Duſt and Aſhes.</hi> Read to the ſame Purpoſe, Iſai. 6. from the 1ſt to the End of the 5th Verſe; if you have never ſeen any Thing of the Evil of Sin as it is againſt God, you have Reaſon to fear, you never were rightly convinced of the evil Nature of Sin. And as the Law of God is agreeable to his Nature holy, juſt and good, ſo if we ſee Sin as it is againſt God, we ſhall all ſee it in a good Meaſure as it is againſt the Law.</p>
            <p>I muſt add (for I eſteem it a Thing of great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance) have you ever ſeen what a dreadful A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe Sin is of the Mercy of God? And particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, as that is diſcovered, in giving us a glorious Saviour, and ſo as our Sins pierce our Saviour.</p>
            <p>When we conſider this and other Diſcoveries of the Mercy of God, doth this melt us down into a true and genuine Contrition for our Sins, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to us more of its vile Nature. <hi>The Goodneſs of God leads to Repentance.</hi> Rom. 2. 4.</p>
            <p>But to add no more here, no Conviction may be rely'd upon as a good Ground of Hope, unleſs it be followed by a real Converſion and turning from Sin to God.</p>
            <p>Again, do you hope for Happineſs, becauſe after you have been convicted of Sin, you have ſuddenly, or by flower Degrees, had great Light, Joy and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort;
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:005029_0042_100E68E813F05AD8"/>
and ſeemed to have clear Sights, or Viſions of Chriſt and Heaven! I beſeech you ſuffer me in Love and Faithfulneſs to your Souls, to tell you: Theſe Things alone are not to be reſted in as a ſure Foundation of Hope of Salvation. <hi>There is the Joy of the Hypocrite as well as of the true Believer,</hi> Job 20. 5. We read, <hi>that the triumphing of the Wicked is ſhort, and the Joy of the Hypocrite but for a Moment,</hi> And the Apoſtle tells us, 2 Cor. 11. 14. That <hi>Satan himſelf is transformed into an Angel of Light.</hi> It is to be feared ſome may be deceived with falſe and ill-grounded Joys. Such ſenſible Enjoyments and Manifeſtations are exceeding ſweet and refreſhing, when after ſome Clouds, the Soul of the Believer, has been ſeeking hard after God; and when theſe Things are accompany'd with other good and clear Evidences of a good Hope. What I caution you againſt is placing too much in ſuch ſenſible Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and taking them for Evidences of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, when indeed they are not in themſelves, to be reſted in as ſuch. Let me juſt add, do you hope for Salvation becauſe you have partly forſaken your former Sins and partly comply'd with your former neglected Duties? we are glad of any Reformation, in any Thing, and how much more glad ſhould we be to ſee a thorough univerſal Reformation of your Lives, proceeding from a real Change wrought in your Hearts! But I muſt tell you that there may be a partial Reformation where there is not a thorough Reformation, and there may be a conſiderable out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Change and Reformation for a Time, and yet not any real Change wrought in the Heart, without which you are not converted in a Goſpel-Senſe: every Change is not Converſion; your different Way of Living, different Company and the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Manner of Converſation: the Examples of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:005029_0043_100E68EA9F51E608"/>
whom you eſteem, or your going from one Stage of Life to another; may give you a different Turn of Thought and be the Means of your diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing ſome evil Things you before took Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in, and ſo cauſe a Change in you: But in this Caſe you ought carefully to conſider whether you have turned from Sin to God, agreeable to that Jer. 4. 1. <hi>If thou wilt return, O Iſrael, ſaith the Lord, return unto me,</hi> Joel 2. 12. There may be a turning from one Sin to another, only an Exchange of Luſts and Sins; but this is of no Manner of Advantage. Converſion implies a turning from all and every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Sin, and alſo a turning unto God. Into his Service, and an holy Obedience to him, and in to all his Ways.</p>
            <p>But not to be further tedious here, consider and cloſely examine whether you have laid the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of your Hope deep and ſure, have you ever been convinced of Sin as it is againſt God, and of your own perſonal Guilt, that you are the Man? Have you had a real Change wrought in you, are the Hearts of Stone taken out of you, and Hearts of Fleſh given to you? And have you truly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced Chriſt as your only and all-ſufficient Saviour, your Prophet, Prieſt and King? And doth your Hope purify your Hearts? By theſe and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Marks, which have been more largely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered before; you may in ſome Meaſure come to know whether you have a good Hope of Salvation or not.</p>
            <p>But you need the Aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit, in your Self-Examination, the Spirit not only works in Believers Souls thoſe Things which are the Foundation of Hope; but when they, as in the Preſence and Fear of God and humbly ſeeking the Help of the Spirit, ſet themſelves to a cloſe and
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:005029_0044_100E68EC21FEB2A0"/>
ſerious Examination of themſelves as to their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Eſtate, he graciouſly aſſiſts them, brings Things to their Minds, and gives them to ſee that they have ſuch Things in them as are the Evidences of a good Hope, and ſo enables them to draw a ſure Concluſion that they are in the Way to Glory. And when the Spirit gives theſe Evidences in their full Strength and Brightneſs and ſo as to remove Doubts from them, this is a full Aſſurance of Hope: And now the Spirit may be ſaid to witneſs with our Spirits that we are the Children of God.</p>
            <p>But it is high Time I ſhould proceed in the fourth Place to a Uſe of Exhortation, with which I ſhall conclude all.</p>
            <p>And the Exhortation may be addreſs'd to the following Sorts of Perſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I would ſpeak to ſuch as are <hi>thoughtleſs and unconcerned although they have no Manner of Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to hope for Salvation upon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And are there not ſome ſuch, who now hear me, even in ſuch a Day of the wonderful Striving of the Spirit as this is! And after all that God has done for them? I am afraid there are ſome who if they were asked what Ground they have to hope for Salvation hereafter; could only tell you, that God is merciful, and they are his Creatures. And ſo they hope for Mercy, although they in a moſt horrid and ſhameful Manner abuſe the Mercy of God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Day, although they live in all Manner of Sin and Wickedneſs, ſerving the Devil and gratifying their own Heart's Luſts. Surely as to ſuch I may ſay you are without Hope, you are treaſuring up to yourſelves Wrath againſt the Day of Wrath, and Revelation of the righteous Judgment of God. But are there not others who although they don't live the moſt vicious Lives; yet have no Reaſon to
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:005029_0045_100E68EDA2FCF860"/>
believe they have ever repented of Sin, or received a Saviour, that ever they have been converted, and that do indulge ſome Sins; And yet are perfectly ſenſeleſs of any Danger, go on in a Series of Thoughtleſſneſs, and a perfect Neglect of the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their precious and immortal Souls. And Oh what a dreadful Condition are all ſuch in!</p>
            <p>With what Words ſhall I ſpeak unto you, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you to a proper Concern for yourſelves? You, it is like have no Senſe of your Danger, and have no Concern for yourſelves, don't pity your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but your faithful Miniſters are concerned for you, and even <hi>travail in Birth for you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Be exhorted, poor miſerable Souls, at leaſt to ſit down and conſider, what a Caſe you are indeed in. You can be but little longer in this World, and what will become of you when God ſhall require your Souls and you ſhall go over into an immenſe and endleſs Eternity; Chriſt is the only Saviour and him you deſpiſe and ſlight, you will not receive him nor have him to rule over you, and how can you be happy! Nay look into your Hearts and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſee ſomething what you are: look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and conſider the Being Perfections and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of God: And ſee how unlike him you are, and how impoſſible it is you ſhould be happy in the Enjoyment of God. Conſider the Inhabitants, the Enjoyments and Employments of Heaven: and think whether you are a Companion fit for ſuch Beings, and a Perſon qualified for ſuch Work and Enjoyments? And then O turn your Eyes down to Hell, and conſider how much you are like the Devils in your Tempers and Diſpoſitions, and how much fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you are for the curſed Employments of Hell, and the Miſeries thereof, than for Heaven. See (and O that you could ſee) the Wrath of God
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:005029_0046_100E68F06711F400"/>
that hangs over you, and the Gulf of Fire and Brimſtone that gapes for you beneath.—Strive as you value your Souls to ſee your undone and miſerable Eſtate; and work out your Salvation with Fear and Trembling: Give yourſelves no Reſt, and delay not one Moment, until you have laid a ſure Foundation of Hope of Salvation. Conſider there is a Saviour offered and Salvation is offered to you as well as others. And why will you not accept the Offer? The Spirit of God is ſtriving in a wonderful Manner with People, here and elſewhere, many are now taken, and why will you be leſt; ſhall your Parents, ſhall your Brethren and Siſters; ſhall your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, yea ſhall your Children or even your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, be taken by the Grace of God and be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally happy? And will you be the only Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that will ſtand out againſt the Calls of God and the Strivings of the Spirit? Are you reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to go on in your carnal Security, without any Foundation of Hope of Happineſs, till you drop into everlaſting Miſery! Oh that it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (while it is an accepted Time and Day of Salvation) to awaken you to a Senſe of your Sin and Miſery.</p>
            <p>But I turn myſelf ſecondly, <hi>to awakened and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced Sinners, who are now ſenſible, that your former Hopes were vain, and ſo are deſirous without Delay, to lay a good Foundation of Hope</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is more Hope of you now than ever before, that you may be plucked as Brands out of the Burning: Bleſs God therefore that you are awakened and convinced; And by all Means cheriſh your Convictions; And ſee that they don't wear off, until you are converted. And let me tell you there is Danger that you will now
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:005029_0047_100E68F4140A8610"/>
build your Hopes upon a falſe Foundation. The Devil is alarmed at your Awakening and Convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and if it be poſſible he will either quench your Convictions and cauſe them to wear off; ſo that you may have ſome ſeeming Red and Eaſe; or he will bring you to reſt upon ſome new and falſe Foundation of Hope and ſo deceive you at laſt: Therefore, dear Friends and Brethren, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider well what you do, and be adviſed and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Not to be too haſly and ſudden, in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you are converted and in taking Comfort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am afraid many deceive themſelves by this. When they are under powerful Convictions and as it were ſinking down into deep Waters; they are ready; (like a drowning Man) to catch hold of any Thing they can; to lay hold of any thing that looks like Converſion; and ſo, through the Deceitfulneſs, of Satan, their own Hearts of Sin, (and 'twere well if not through the <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Raſhneſs</hi> of ſome that pretend to be <hi>Teachers</hi> and <hi>Exhorters</hi>) are in great Danger of thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a good Eſtate when they are not. Oh beware of this! You ſee you have hitherto been deceived; ſee to it that you don't now reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another equally falſe Foundation of Hope; this may be infinitely dangerous to you, as you have heard. Let me adviſe you therefore,</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>To ſtudy carefully what a good and ſure Foundation of Hope is on which you may ſafely reſt.</hi>

            <p>A Miſtake in this may be fatal, therefore be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding careful about it; and before you cry Peace to your Souls; ſee that you have a full and clear Underſtanding what it is you may ſafely

reſt upon; and here I beſeech you make the <hi>precious Bible</hi> your Rule. Study that, and ſuch good Books as are agreeable to it. Don't regard ſo much what others tell you of their Experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; And what you muſt find and feel in your ſelves, as what the Word of God tells you, you muſt find and experience, Call no Man Lord or Maſter here, and let nothing ſatisfy your Souls till you come to be well aſſured that you have indeed thoſe Marks and Evidences that you are real Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, which are recorded in the holy Word of God. In a Word, reſt not till your Hopes are built upon the Foundations before mentioned.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Be prevailed on duely to attend on the publick Worſhip and other Means of Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.</hi> Rom. 10. 17. If you love your Souls let no Temptation be able to hinder you from this; and attend with proper Care, Diligence, and Conſtancy: And by no Means needleſly and often, (as with <hi>itching Ears</hi>) wander from the Place of your ſtated Worſhip.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Be much in Self-Examination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When you are ſatisfied what is a good Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Hope, ſee whether you have built your Hopes upon it, this you muſt come to a Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of, by examining your ſelves, be much, be often, therefore in this and ſee that your Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation be thorough and impartial. Set yourſelves as in the Preſence of an holy, an heart-ſearching God, and imploring his Aſſiſtance, ſearch your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and the Foundation of your Hope to the very Bottom.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Be careful leaſt you be toſſed about wth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Wind of Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="unknown:005029_0049_100E68F9C7AE2020"/>Beware left by hearing many different Preachers (who if they think alike, yet may expreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves very differently) you get loſt and confuſed in your Thoughts, and ſo become uncapable of determining any Thing about yourſelves and your ſpiritual Eſtate. I will only add,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly.</hi> Be much in Prayer to God.</p>
            <p>Plead with him to lead you into a plain Path; cry mightily to God that he will ſave you from reſting upon any falſe Foundations. That he will work in you a true Repentance of and Converſion from Sin and an unſeigned Faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that he will accept you in the Covenant of Grace, and entitle you to all his gracious Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that ſo your Hope of Happineſs may be ſure and well-grounded; inſtead of conſulting thoſe who know but very little, either <hi>doctrinally</hi> or <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally</hi> of theſe Things; go to thoſe, whom Chriſt having <hi>accounted faithful hath ſet over you in the Miniſtry</hi>: Enquire of them what you ſhall do to be ſaved in a meek and humble Manner. If you in theſe and ſuch like Ways cheriſh your Convictions and endeavour to lay a good Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Hope, you will be in a Way of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch an Hope as will never make you aſhamed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I am to ſpeak a few Words to <hi>ſuch as hope you are in the Way to Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have heard, from the Word of God, that there is Danger that you may be aſhamed of your Hope. Let all ſuch therefore be exhorted to ſee to it that the Foundation of your Hope be good. A bear Poſſibility of your being deceived, ſhould quicken you to the greateſt Care in examining the Foundation you build upon. Could I certainly tell you that there is one, in this great Aſſembly that although he is full of the Hopes of Heaven yet
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:005029_0050_100E68FD55CB29A0"/>
has no Foundation therefor, and ſo will be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of his Hopes; would you not all be ready with the Diſciples to ſay, <hi>Lord is it I, Lord is it I</hi>? It is our Duty to be often looking over the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of our good Eſtate, &amp; let us be perſuaded to do it. Let us go back to the very beginning and ſee what it is that we laid as the Foundation of our Hope; ſee whether that be good. And if any Soul of us who are Profeſſors, and have a Hope of Salvation find that our Hope is built on the Sand, Oh! let us bewail it before God and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately be up and doing, and endeavouring to lay a better Foundation of Hope. Bleſſed be God it may not be too late; there may yet be Hope for ſuch, if they will without Delay ſtrive and endeavour to rectify this dangerous Miſtake, and as your Hearts have hitherto deceived you, be very jealous over them. Be careful, above all Things, that you be no more deceived in a Matter of ſuch infinite Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance: But ſee that you now lay a good Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Hope.</p>
            <p>To conclude, if after the beſt Examination you find; (as I hope many of you will) that your Hopes of Salvation are well-grounded, <hi>give all the Glory to God,</hi> whoſe Work it is: beware of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Thing to darken your Evidences to cauſe the Comforter that now relieves your Souls, to go far from you, endeavour every Way to perſwade, aſſiſt and allure others to come into the ſame happy Condition with yourſelves.</p>
            <p>Happy, Brethren, are you here, happy ſhall you be at Death, happy ſhall you be to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; Through Jeſus Chriſt, to whom with the Father and Spirit, be Praiſes everlaſting. AMEN.</p>
