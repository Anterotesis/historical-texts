         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Now give you my Thoughts on the <hi>Queſtions</hi> you lately ſent me. As you ſet me the Taſk, you muſt take the Performance as it is without any Apology for its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. I have wrote with the uſual Freedom of a Friend, aiming at nothing but Truth, and to expreſs my ſelf ſo as to be underſtood. In order to <hi>anſwer</hi> your <hi>main Enquiry</hi> concerning the <hi>Extent</hi> of the <hi>civil Magiſtrate's Power</hi> reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing RELIGION; I ſuppoſe it needful to look back to the <hi>End,</hi> and therefore to the <hi>Original</hi> of it: By which Means I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a juſt Notion may be formed of what is properly <hi>their Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs</hi> or the <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>their Power;</hi> and ſo without any inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable Difficulty we may thence learn what is out of that Compaſs.</p>
            <p>That the SACRED SCRIPTURES are the <hi>alone Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> to a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are agreed in; and muſt therefore inviolably maintain, that every Chriſtian has <hi>a Right of judging for himſelf</hi> what he is to believe and practice in Religion according to that Rule: Which I think on a full Examination you will find perfectly inconſiſtent with any Power in the civil Magiſtrate to make any penal Laws in Matters of Religion. Tho' <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are agreed in the <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of that Principle, yet too many in <hi>Practice</hi> have departed from it. The Evils that have been introduced thereby into the Chriſtian Church are more than can be reckoned up. Becauſe of the great Importance of it to the Chriſtian and to his ſtanding faſt in that <hi>Liberty</hi> wherewith CHRIST has made him free, you will not fault me if I am the longer upon it. The more firmly this is eſtabliſhed in our Minds; the more firm ſhall we be againſt all Attempts upon our <hi>Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> and better practice that <hi>Chriſtian Charity</hi> towards ſuch as are of different Sentiments from us in Religion that is ſo much recommended
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:005520_0004_10184C9508831F78"/>
and inculcated in thoſe ſacred Oracles, and which a juſt Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of our <hi>Chriſtian Rights</hi> has a natural Tendency to influence us to. And tho' your Sentiments about ſome of thoſe Points you demand my Thoughts upon may have been different from mine; yet I perſwade my ſelf, you will not think mine to be far from the Truth when you ſhall have throughly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what follows. But if I am miſtaken in the Grounds I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed upon or in any Concluſion drawn from true Premiſes, I ſhall be thankful to have the ſame pointed out: Truth being what I ſeek, to which all muſt bow firſt or laſt.</p>
            <p>To proceed then as I have juſt hinted, I ſhall <hi>Firſt,</hi> briefly conſider <hi>the Origin and End of Civil Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> As to <hi>the Origin</hi>—Reaſon teaches us that <hi>all Men</hi> are <hi>naturally equal</hi> in Reſpect of <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> or <hi>Dominion</hi> one over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Altho' true it is that <hi>Children</hi> are not born <hi>in</hi> this full State of Equality, yet they are born <hi>to</hi> it. Their <hi>Parents</hi> have a Sort of Rule &amp; Jurdiſdiction over them when they come into the World, and for ſome Time after: But it is but a temporary one; which ariſes from that Duty incumbent on them to take Care of their Offspring during the imperfect State of Childhood, to preſerve, nouriſh and educate them (as the Workmanſhip of their own almighty MAKER, to whom they are to be accountable for them,) and govern the Actions of their yet ignorant Nonage, 'till <hi>Reaſon</hi> ſhall take its Place and eaſe them of that Trouble. For GOD having given <hi>Man</hi> an <hi>Underſtanding</hi> to direct his Actions, has given him therewith a <hi>Freedom</hi> of <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Acting,</hi> as properly belonging thereto, within the Bounds of <hi>that Law</hi> he is under: And whilſt he is in a State wherein he has no Underſtanding of his own to direct his Will, he is not to have any Will of his own to follow: He that underſtands for him muſt will for him too.—But when he comes to ſuch a State of <hi>Reaſon</hi> as made the <hi>Father</hi> free, the ſame muſt make the <hi>Son</hi> free too: For the <hi>Freedom</hi> of <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>acting</hi> according to his own <hi>Will</hi> (without being ſubject to the Will of another) is grounded on his having <hi>Reaſon,</hi> which is able to inſtruct him in <hi>that Law</hi> he is to govern himſelf by, and make him know how far he is left to the Freedom of his own Will. So that we are <hi>born Free</hi> as we are <hi>born Rational.</hi> Not that we have actually the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of either as ſoon as born; <hi>Age</hi> that bring <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

made under a <hi>Law</hi> from its MAKER: But it conſiſts in a <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> from any <hi>ſuperiour Power on Earth,</hi> and not being under the Will or legiſlative Authority of <hi>Man,</hi> and having only the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> (or in other Words, of its MAKER) for his Rule.</p>
            <p>And as Reaſon tells us, all are born thus <hi>naturally equal,</hi> i. e. with an <hi>equal Right</hi> to their <hi>Perſons;</hi> ſo alſo with an equal Right to their <hi>Preſervation;</hi> and therefore to <hi>ſuch Things</hi> as Nature affords for their <hi>Subſiſtence.</hi> For which Purpoſe GOD was pleaſed to make a Grant of <hi>the Earth in common</hi> to the <hi>Children of Men,</hi> firſt to <hi>Adam</hi> and afterwards to <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>his Sons:</hi> as the Pſalmiſt ſays, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115. 16. And altho' no one has originally a private Dominion excluſive of the reſt of Mankind in the Earth or its Products, as they are conſider'd in this their natural State; yet ſince GOD has given <hi>theſe Things</hi> for the Uſe of Men and given them <hi>Reaſon</hi> alſo to make Uſe thereof to the beſt Advantage of Life; there muſt of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be a <hi>Means</hi> to <hi>appropriate</hi> them ſome Way or other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can be of any Uſe to any particular Perſon. And <hi>every Man</hi> having a <hi>Property</hi> in his own <hi>Perſon,</hi> the <hi>Labour of his Body</hi> and <hi>the Work of his Hands</hi> are properly his own, to which no one has Right but himſelf; it will therefore follow that when he removes any Thing out of the State that Nature has provided and left it in, he has <hi>mixed his Labour</hi> with it and joined ſomething to it that is his own, and thereby makes it his Property. He having removed it out of the <hi>common State</hi> Nature placed it in, it hath by <hi>this Labour</hi> ſomething annexed to it that excludes the common Right of others; becauſe <hi>this La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour</hi> being the unqueſtionable Property of the Labourer, no Man but he can have a Right to what that is once joined to, at leaſt where there is enough and as good left in common for others. Thus <hi>every Man</hi> having a <hi>natural Right</hi> to (or being the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor of) his own <hi>Perſon</hi> and his own <hi>Actions</hi> and <hi>Labour</hi> and to what he can honeſtly acquire by his Labour, which we call <hi>Property;</hi> it certainly follows, that no Man can have a Right to the <hi>Perſon</hi> or <hi>Property</hi> of <hi>another:</hi> And if every Man has a Right to his <hi>Perſon</hi> and <hi>Property;</hi> he has alſo a Right to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend</hi> them, and a Right to all the <hi>neceſſary Means of Defence,</hi> and ſo has a Right of <hi>puniſhing</hi> all Inſults upon his Perſon and Property.</p>
            <p>But becauſe in <hi>ſuch a State of Nature,</hi> every Man muſt be <hi>Judge</hi> of the Breach of the Law of Nature and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

(even in his own Caſe) and the greater Part being no ſtrict Obſervers of Equity and Juſtice; the <hi>Enjoyment</hi> of Property in this State is <hi>not very ſafe. Three Things</hi> are wanting in this State (as the celebrated <hi>Lock</hi> obſerves) to render them ſafe; <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> an <hi>eſtabliſhed known Law</hi> received and allowed by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Conſent to be the Standard of Right and Wrong, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Meaſure to decide all Controverſies between them: For tho' the Law of Nature be intelligible to all rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; yet Men being biaſſed by their Intereſt as well as igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for Want of the Study of it, are not apt to allow of it as a Law binding to them in the Application of it to their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Caſes. There wants alſo a <hi>known and indifferent Judge</hi> with Authority to determine all Differences according to the eſtabliſhed Law: for Men are too apt to be partial to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and too much wanting in a juſt Concern for the Intereſt of others. There often wants alſo in a State of Nature, a <hi>Power to back and ſupport the Sentence</hi> when right, and give it due Execution.—Now to remedy theſe Inconveniencies, <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> teaches Men to <hi>join in Society,</hi> to unite together into a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth under ſome Form or other, to make a Body of Laws agreable to the Law of Nature, and inſtitute one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Power to ſee them obſerved.—It is they who thus unite together, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> the People, who make and alone have Right to make the Laws that are to take Place among them; or which comes to the ſame Thing, appoint thoſe who ſhall make them, and who ſhall ſee them executed.—For every Man has an equal Right to the Preſervation of his Perſon and Property; and ſo an equal Right to eſtabliſh a Law, or to nominate the Makers and Executors of the Laws which are the Guardians both of Perſon and Property.</p>
            <p>Hence then the Fountain and Original of all civil Power is from the People, and is certainly inſtituted for their Sakes; or in other Words, which was the <hi>ſecond Thing</hi> propoſed, <hi>The great End of civil Government,</hi> is <hi>the Preſervation of their Perſons, their Liberties and Eſtates, or their Property.</hi> Moſt certain it is, that it muſt be for their own Sakes, the rendering their Condition better than it was in what is called a State of Nature (a State without ſuch eſtabliſh'd Laws as before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, or without any common Power) that Men would willingly put themſelves out of that State. It is nothing but <hi>their own Good</hi> can be any rational Inducement to it: and to ſuppoſe they either ſhould or would do it on any other, is to
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005520_0007_10184C9E76AA27E8"/>
ſuppoſe rational Creatures ought to change their State with a Deſign to make it worſe. And <hi>that Good</hi> which in ſuch a State they find a need of, is no other then a <hi>greater Security of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of what belonged to them.</hi> That and that only can then be the true Reaſon of their uniting together in ſome Form or other they judge beſt for the obtaining that greater Security. <hi>That greater Security</hi> therefore of Life, Liberty, Money, Lands, Houſes, Family, and the like, which may be all comprehended under that of <hi>Perſon</hi> and <hi>Property,</hi> is the <hi>ſole End</hi> of all <hi>civil Government.</hi> I mean not that all civil Governments (as ſo called) are thus conſtituted: (tho' the <hi>Britiſh</hi> and ſome few other Nations are through a merciful Providence ſo happy as to have ſuch.) There are too too many arbitrary Governments in the World, where the People don't make their own Laws. Theſe are not properly ſpeaking <hi>Governments</hi> but <hi>Tyrannies;</hi> and are abſolutely againſt the <hi>Law of</hi> GOD and <hi>Nature.</hi> But I am conſidering Things as they be in their own Nature, what Reaſon teaches concerning them: and herein have given <hi>a ſhort Sketch</hi> of what the celebrated Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> in <hi>his Treatiſe of Government</hi> has largely demonſtrated; and in which it is juſtly to be preſumed all are agreed who underſtand the natural Rights of Mankind.</p>
            <p>Thus having ſeen what the <hi>End</hi> of <hi>civil Government</hi> is; I ſuppoſe we ſee a fair Foundation laid for the Determination of the <hi>next Thing</hi> I propoſed to conſider: Which is, <hi>What Liberty or Power belonging to Man as he is a reaſonable Creature does every Man give up to the civil Government whereof he is a Member.</hi>—Some Part of their natural Liberty they do certainly give up to the Government, for the Benefit of Society and mutual Defence, (for in a political Society <hi>every one</hi> even an <hi>Infant</hi> has the whole Force of the Community to protect him) and ſomething therefore is certainly given up to the Whole for this Purpoſe.—Now the Way to know what Branches of natural Liberty are <hi>given up,</hi> and what <hi>remain</hi> to us after our Admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into civil Society, is to conſider <hi>the Ends</hi> for which Men enter into a State of Government.—For ſo much Liberty and no more is departed from, as is neceſſary to ſecure thoſe Ends; the reſt is certainly our own ſtill. And here I ſuppoſe with the before-mentioned noble Aſſertor of the Liberties of humane Nature; <hi>all that is given up</hi> may be reduced to <hi>two Heads.</hi>—1ſt. The <hi>Power</hi> that every one has in a State of Nature <hi>to do whatever he judgeth ſit,</hi> for the <hi>Preſervation</hi> of his <hi>Perſon</hi> and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005520_0008_10184CA12E8CA428"/>
               <hi>Property</hi> and that of others alſo, within the Permiſſion of the Law of Nature, he gives up to be regulated by Laws made by the Society, ſo far forth as the <hi>Preſervation</hi> of himſelf (his <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon</hi> and <hi>Property</hi>) and the reſt of that Society ſhall require And, 2. The <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>puniſhing</hi> he wholly gives up, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages his natural Force (which he might before employ in the Execution of the Law of Nature by his own ſingle Authority as he thought fit) to aſſiſt the executive Power of the Society as the Law thereof ſhall require. For (he adds) being now in a <hi>new State</hi> wherein he is to enjoy many Conveniencies, from the Labour Aſſiſtance and Society of others in the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, as well as Protection from its whole Strength; he is to part alſo with as much of his natural Liberty and providing for himſelf, as the Good and Safety of the Society ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; which is not only <hi>neceſſary</hi> but <hi>juſt,</hi> ſince the other Members of the Society do the like. Now if the giving up <hi>theſe Powers</hi> be <hi>ſufficient</hi> to anſwer <hi>thoſe Ends</hi> for which Men enter into a State of Government, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> the better Security of their Perſons and Properties; then no more is parted with; and therefore <hi>all the reſt</hi> is ours ſtill. This I reſt on as certain, that <hi>no more natural Liberty or Power is given up than is neceſſary for the Preſervation of Perſon and Property.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I deſign not to mention many Particulars which according to this Rule I ſuppoſe are not parted with by entering into a State of Government: what is reducible to <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two general Heads</hi> is ſufficient to our preſent Purpoſe.—Tho' as I paſs I cannot forbear taking notice of <hi>one Point of Liberty</hi> which all Members of a free State and particularly <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> think belonging to them, and are fond of; and that is the <hi>Right</hi> that <hi>every one</hi> has <hi>to ſpeak his Sentiments openly</hi> concerning <hi>ſuch Matters as affect the good of the whole.</hi> Every Member of a Community ought to be concerned for the <hi>whole,</hi> as well as for <hi>his particular Part:</hi> His Life and all, as to this World is as it were embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſame Bottom, and is perpetually intereſted in the good or ill Succeſs thereof: Whenever therefore he ſees a <hi>Rock</hi> on which there is a Probability the Veſſel may ſplit, or if he ſees a <hi>Sand</hi> that may ſwallow it up, or if he foreſees a <hi>Storm</hi> that is like to ariſe; his own Intereſt is too deeply concerned not to give Notice of the Danger: And the Right he has to his own Life and Property gives him a Right to ſpeak his Sentiments. If the <hi>Pilot</hi> or <hi>Captain</hi> don't think fit to take any Notice of it, yet it ſeems to be certain they have no Right <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

of him who thinks he eſpys Danger to the whole Ships Crew, or to puniſh the well-meaning Informer. A Man would ſcarce deſerve the Character of a <hi>good Member of Society</hi> who ſhould reſolve to be ſilent on all Occaſions, and never mind, ſpeak or guard againſt the Follies or Ignorance or Miſtakes of thoſe at the Helm. And Government rather incourages than takes away a Liberty, the Uſe of which is ſo needful and often very beneficial to the Whole, as Experience has abundantly ſhown.</p>
            <p>But not to detain you here,</p>
            <p>I. The Members of a civil State or Society do <hi>retain</hi> their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Liberty <hi>in all ſuch Caſes</hi> as have <hi>no Relation</hi> to the <hi>Ends</hi> of ſuch a Society.—In a State of Nature Men had a Right to read <hi>Milton</hi> or <hi>Lock</hi> for their Inſtruction or Amuſement: and why they do not retain this Liberty under a Government that is inſtituted for the <hi>Preſervation</hi> of their <hi>Perſons</hi> and <hi>Properties,</hi> is inconceivable. From whence can ſuch a Society derive any Right to hinder them from doing that which does not affect the <hi>Ends</hi> of that Society? Should a Government therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the free Uſe of <hi>the Scriptures,</hi> prohibit Men the reading of them, and make it Penal to examine and ſearch them; it would be a manifeſt Uſurpation upon the common Rights of Mankind, as much a Violation of natural Liberty as the Attack of a Highwayman upon the Road can be upon our civil Rights. And indeed with reſpect to the <hi>ſacred Writings,</hi> Men might not only read them if the Government did prohibit the ſame, but they would be bound by a higher Authority to read them, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding any humane Prohibition. The Pretence of any Authority to reſtrain Men from reading the ſame, is wicked as well as vain.—But whether in ſome Caſes that have no Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>Ends</hi> of Government and wherein therefore Men retain their natural Liberty; if the civil Authority ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt by a Law to reſtrain Men, People might not be oblig'd to ſubmit therein, is not here at all the Queſtion: tho' I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that in ſuch Caſe wherein they ought to ſubmit, the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation thereto would ariſe from ſome other Conſideration, and not from the ſuppoſed Law; there being no binding Force in a Law where a rightful Authority to make the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

(which contains the whole of it) and to make the beſt Uſe of it he can for his own Information in the Will of GOD, the Nature and Duties of Chriſtianity. And as every Chriſtian is ſo bound; ſo he has an <hi>unalienable Right</hi> to <hi>judge</hi> of the <hi>Senſe and Meaning</hi> of it, and to follow his Judgment wherever it leads him; even an equal Right with any Rulers be they Civil or Eccleſiaſtical.—This I ſay, I take to be an original Right of the humane Nature, and ſo far from being given up by the Individuals of a Community that it cannot be given up by them if they ſhould be ſo weak as to offer it. Man by his Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as he is a <hi>reaſonable</hi> Being capable of the Knowledge of his MAKER; is a <hi>moral &amp; accountable</hi> Being: and therefore as every one is accountable for himſelf, he muſt reaſon, judge and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine for himſelf. That Faith and Practice which depends on the Judgment and Choice of any other Perſon, and not on the Perſon's own Underſtanding Judgment and Choice, may paſs for Religion in the Synagogue of <hi>Satan,</hi> whoſe Tenet is that Ignorance is the Mother of Devotion; but with no underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Proteſtant will it paſs for any Religion at all. No Action is a religious Action without Underſtanding and Choice in the Agent. Whence it follows, the Rights of Conſcience are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and equal in all, and ſtrictly ſpeaking unalienable. This <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>judging every one for himſelf in Matters of Religion</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults from the Nature of Man, and is ſo inſeperably connected therewith, that a Man can no more part with it than he can with his <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Thinking:</hi> and it is equally reaſonable for him to attempt to ſtrip himſelf of the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Reaſoning,</hi> as to attempt the veſting of another with this Right. And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever invades this Right of another, be he <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Caeſar,</hi> may with equal Reaſon aſſume the other's Power of Thinking, and ſo level him with the Brutal Creation.—A Man may alienate ſome Branches of his Property and give up his Right in them to others; but he cannot transfer the <hi>Rights</hi> of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he could deſtroy his rational and moral Powers, or ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute ſome other to be judged for him at the Tribunal of GOD.</p>
            <p>But what may further clear this Point and at the ſame Time ſhew the <hi>Extent</hi> of this <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>private Judgment</hi> in Matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> is this Truth, That the <hi>ſacred Scriptures</hi> are the alone Rule of Faith and Practice to every individual Chriſtian. Were it needful I might eaſily ſhow, the ſacred Scriptures have all the Character neceſſary to conſtitute a juſt and proper Rule of Faith and Practice, and that they alone have them.—It is
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005520_0011_10184CA7901EDC90"/>
ſufficient for all ſuch as acknowledge the divine Authority of the Scriptures, briefly to obſerve, that GOD the Author has therein declared he has given and deſigned them to be our only Rule of Faith and Practice. Thus ſays the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15, 16; That they <hi>are given by Inſpiration from</hi> GOD, <hi>and are profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs; that the Man of</hi> GOD <hi>may be perfect, thoroughly furniſhed unto every good Work.</hi> So the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> in his Goſpel, Chap. 20. Ver. 31. ſays; <hi>Theſe Things are written that ye might believe that</hi> JESUS <hi>is the</hi> CHRIST, <hi>the</hi> SON <hi>of</hi> GOD, <hi>and that believing ye might have Life through his Name.</hi> And in his <hi>firſt Epiſtle,</hi> Chap. 5. Ver. 13. <hi>Theſe Things have I written, that ye may know that ye have eternal Life, and that ye may believe on the Name of the</hi> SON <hi>of</hi> GOD. Theſe Paſſages ſhow that what was written was to be the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rule of Faith and Practice, compleat and moſt ſufficient for ſuch an End, deſigned by infinite Wiſdom in the giving them, containing every Thing needful to be known and done by Chriſtians, or ſuch as believe on the Name of the SON of GOD. Now inaſmuch as the Scriptures are the only Rule of Faith and Practice to a Chriſtian; then every one has an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alienable Right to read, enquire into, and impartially judge of the Senſe and Meaning of it for himſelf. For if he is to be governed and determined therein by the Opinions and Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of any others, the Scriptures ceaſe to be a Rule to him, and thoſe Opinions or Determinations of others are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in the Room thereof. But you will ſay, <hi>The Prieſt's Lips ſhould keep Knowledge, and they ſhould ſeek the Law at his Mouth,</hi> Mal.—7.—Yes; that is, it is their Duty to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the Scriptures, and the People's Duty at the ſame Time to ſearch the Scriptures to ſee whether thoſe Things they ſay are ſo. <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 11. The Officers CHRIST has commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned in his Church, as <hi>Paſtors</hi> or <hi>Biſhops,</hi> are to teach his Laws, to explain as they are able the Mind &amp; Will of CHRIST laid down in the Scriptures; but they have no Warrant to make any Laws for them, nor are their Sentiments the Rule to any Chriſtian, who are <hi>all commanded</hi> to <hi>prove all Things,</hi> to <hi>try the Spirits whether they be of</hi> GOD. 1 Thes. 5. 21. 1 Joh. 4. 1. <hi>I ſpeak as to wiſe Men,</hi> ſays PAUL, <hi>judge ye what I ſay,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 15. Theſe and many other Texts I might have alledg'd, entirely anſwer the Objection, and eſtabliſh the Point before us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:005520_0012_10184CAC957433E8"/>
The Evidence of the Point before us ariſes out of the <hi>Nature</hi> of a <hi>Rule of Faith and Practice.</hi> For a Rule of Faith and Practice is certainly <hi>that</hi> from which we muſt take and rectify all our Conceptions, and by which we ought to regulate all our Actions, concerning all thoſe Matters to which this Rule re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates. As it is the <hi>Rule</hi> of our <hi>Faith,</hi> we muſt receive no Doctrines but what that contains: otherwiſe our Faith is not directed by that Rule; but other Things in that Caſe are taken up and believed for Truths which that Rule takes no Notice of; and therefore it is done on ſome other Authority, which in Reality therefore becomes our Rule, inſtead of that which of Right ought to be ſo. A <hi>Rule,</hi> conſidered as ſuch, is a Meaſure or Director with which a Thing is to be compared and made to agree: And therefore a Rule of Faith and Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice is <hi>that</hi> which being applied to our Minds directs and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates them, by informing the Underſtanding and guiding the Will, and ſo influencing all our Actions. <hi>That</hi> which is the <hi>Rule</hi> of our <hi>Faith</hi> muſt point out to us and teach us the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Doctrines and inform us of the ſeveral Facts which we are to believe: And if we have entertained any wrong Notions or erroneous Opinions, they are to be corrected and regulated, by being compared and made to agree with this Rule. So alſo the <hi>Rule</hi> of our <hi>Practice</hi> is <hi>that</hi> from which we are to learn the ſeveral Duties we are to perform, and how all our Actions are to be regulated.—'Tis the Nature of a Rule of Faith and Practice to include all this. <hi>That</hi> whereby Men examine into the Truth of any Thing, is to them the Rule of Truth; <hi>that</hi> from whence they learn what they ought to believe, is to them the Rule of Faith; and <hi>that</hi> to which they conform their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is their Rule of Practice. If Men receive the Doctrines preſcribed to them by the <hi>Pope,</hi> by a <hi>Council,</hi> by a <hi>Convocation</hi> or a <hi>Parliament,</hi> from the Writings of <hi>Fathers,</hi> or <hi>any Doctors</hi> of Learning and Reputation, and conform their Actions to the Dictates and Commands of any of theſe or ſuch like Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; the Authority to which they give this Honour, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the Rule of their Faith and Practice. And ſo if we ſubmit our ſelves truly and impartially to the Authority of CHRIST, and ſearch for the Truths we are to believe, and the Duties we are to perform in his <hi>written Word;</hi> then only do we make Him our Director and Guide, and the Scriptures the Rule of our Faith and Practice. And it is the <hi>ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures alone</hi> which have this Right to our intire Submiſſion, as
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005520_0013_10184CAE1D45A318"/>
now deſcribed: and no other Authority which has yet been or ever ſhall be ſet up, has any Manner of Right at all to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern and direct our <hi>Conſciences</hi> in <hi>religious</hi> Matters.</p>
            <p>This is a Truth of too great Importance for a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ever in any Meaſure to give up; and is ſo clear and obvious a Truth, as may well paſs for a ſelf-evident Maxim, <hi>That a Chriſtian is to receive his Chriſtianity from</hi> CHRIST <hi>alone.</hi> For what is it which is neceſſarily implied and ſuppoſed in the very Notion of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> but this, that he is a Follower and Diſciple of CHRIST, one who receives and profeſſes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his Doctrines as true, and ſubmits to his Commands? And ſo far only as any does this, is he a <hi>Chriſtian:</hi> and ſo far therefore as he receives or admits any other Doctrines or Laws, is he to be denominated from that Perſon or Sect, from whoſe Authority or Inſtruction he receives them.</p>
            <p>Every <hi>Society</hi> ought to be ſubject only to its own proper Legiſlature. The Truth of this is evident at the firſt View; and civil Societies readily adhere to this as an inviolable Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. And this holds equally true with Reſpect to <hi>religious</hi> or <hi>civil Societies;</hi> and therefore as in the <hi>Church</hi> of CHRIST no other Power or Authority may be admitted but that of CHRIST alone; ſo no Laws may be made for, or any Doctrines be taught and enjoined upon the Church of CHRIST beſides thoſe he has made and taught and enjoined. The Laws of <hi>England</hi> are what the Legiſlature of <hi>England</hi> has paſſed into Laws; not what any other Power or Authority inſtitute or teach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Name. And what theſe are, cannot be known from any other but the Law makers, by the Publications they have made and authorized. The Doctrines of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> (if that by a Figure may be called ſo) are ſuch as that Church and its Legiſlature aſſert and own. So the Doctrines or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of CHRIST, is only that which he has appointed and taught, and all that is contained in Scripture: every Thing elſe is of <hi>Men only,</hi> and no Part of the Chriſtian Religion. What is taught by any eſtabliſhed Church, and not contained in Scripture, is indeed the Doctrine of that Church, but not of CHRIST: For none can make Laws to oblige the Church of CHRIST but CHRIST himſelf. The Church of CHRIST as ſuch, muſt receive its Laws from CHRIST only; <hi>i. e.</hi> from the <hi>Scriptures:</hi> for they are to be found no where elſe. The <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> is that which CHRIST has taught; and therefore what he has not taught, but ſome other Perſon, is not
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005520_0014_10184CAFD5848798"/>
the Chriſtian Religion. So alſo the <hi>Church</hi> of CHRIST is that which is founded according to the Directions and Model by him laid down. <hi>That</hi> therefore which is not ſo founded, but upon Principles and Regulations laid down by Men, is ſo far not a Church of CHRIST, but of <hi>Men:</hi> And in all theſe Things the <hi>Scriptures</hi> only can be our Rule. For we cannot know what CHRIST teaches and commands, from what he does not ſay, and what is ſaid only by ſome other Perſon, but it muſt be from what he does teach and command; and all <hi>that</hi> is contained in his <hi>Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, if CHRIST be the <hi>Lord</hi> of the <hi>Conſcience,</hi> the ſole King in his own Kingdom; then it will follow, that <hi>all ſuch</hi> as in any Manner or Degree <hi>aſſume</hi> the Power of directing and governing the Conſciences of Men, are juſtly chargeable with <hi>invading</hi> his rightful Dominion; He alone having the Right they claim. Should the King of <hi>France</hi> take it into his Head to preſcribe Laws to the Subjects of the King of <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;</hi> who would not ſay, it was an Invaſion of and Inſult offer'd to the <hi>Britiſh Legiſlature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might alſo add, That for any to <hi>aſſume</hi> the Power of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the <hi>Conſciences</hi> of Men, not leaving them to the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> alone, is evidently a <hi>declaring them</hi> to be <hi>defective</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient to that Purpoſe; and therefore that our LORD who h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s left us the <hi>Scriptures</hi> for that Purpoſe, did not know what was neceſſary and ſufficient for us, and has given us a Law, the Defects of which were to be ſupplied by the Wiſdom of ſome of his own wiſer Diſciples. How high an Impeachment this is of his infinite Wiſdom, ſuch would do well to conſider, who <hi>impoſe</hi> their own Doctrines, Interpretations or Deciſions upon any Men by Puniſhments, legal Incapacities, or any other Methods beſides thoſe uſed and directed to in the ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>And as all <hi>Impoſers</hi> on Men's Conſciences are guilty of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt GOD and CHRIST, of manifeſt Diſobedience to and Contempt of their Authority and Commands; ſo all they <hi>who ſubmit</hi> their Conſciences to any ſuch unjuſt uſurp'd Authority, beſides the Share which ſuch Perſons neceſſarily have in the Guilt of the Uſurpers, as countenancing and giving in to their illegal Claim and ſupporting their wicked Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, they do likewiſe <hi>renounce Subjection</hi> to the Authority and Laws of CHRIST. To ſubmit our Conſciences to the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of any Man or Order of Men, is not to reaſon and act
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005520_0015_10184CB2C0E2B328"/>
according to our own Underſtanding; but to take every thing for true, that our ſpiritual Guide affirms to be ſo, and that meerly upon his Authority, without examining into, or ſeeing the Truth and Reaſonableneſs of it: And in every Inſtance wherein we thus ſubmit our ſelves to the Direction of any humane Authority, ſo far we ſet aſide and renounce all other Authority, our own Light and Reaſon, and even the Word of GOD and CHRIST: And the Authority of the Guide we ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject our ſelves unto is ſubſtituted in the Stead of all theſe. If we muſt be directed and governed by any humane Power, it concerns us not what any other may teach and command; this the being ſubject to a Power neceſſarily ſuppoſes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes. An <hi>Engliſhman</hi> is ſubject to the Crown and Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and has nothing to do with the Laws and Courts of Judicature in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> or <hi>any other State,</hi> but diſowns and renounces all Obedience thereto. This is a univerſal Rule: And therefore if our Conſciences are under the Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any humane Authority as to religious Matters; they ceaſe to be under the Direction of CHRIST. What CHRIST himſelf has told us is infallibly true, that <hi>no Man can ſerve two Maſters, but he muſt unavoidably prefer the one and neglect the other:</hi> And conſequently whoever looks upon himſelf to be under the Direction and Government of any humane Power in Matters of Religion, does thereby renounce the Authority of CHRIST, and withdraw Obedience from him.</p>
            <p>From <hi>theſe Principles,</hi> we have here laid down, which can't but be held as indubitably true by every conſiſtent <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> THESE COROLLARIES may be deduced.</p>
            <p>I. That the <hi>civil Authority</hi> hath no Power to make or ordain Articles of Faith, Creeds, Forms of Worſhip or Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. This I think evidently follows from what has been ſaid, that they can have no Power to decree any <hi>Articles of Faith.</hi> For theſe are already eſtabliſhed by CHRIST himſelf; and for <hi>Mortals</hi> to pretend any Right of Determination what others ſhall believe, is really to uſurp that Authority which belongs to CHRIST the ſupream King and Head of his Church; who only hath and can have a Right to preſcribe to the Conſciences of Men, as is evident from the laſt foregoing Head. So it alſo follows, that they have no Power to decree <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> in Religion, or <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>divine Worſhip.</hi> And this not only becauſe theſe Things have no Relation to the <hi>Ends</hi> of civil Society; it no Ways concerns the Common-Wealth or any
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005520_0016_10184CB7C4EC8750"/>
Member of it, whether Men pray kneeling or ſtanding, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Sign of the Croſs be uſed or omitted in Baptiſm, that this or the other Ceremony be made uſe of in the Church; but alſo becauſe this is already ſufficiently done by CHRIST in the <hi>ſacred Scriptures.</hi> Theſe contain every Thing needful to be known or done by Chriſtians. It is CHRIST'S ſole Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative to inſtitute the whole and every Part of religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Who can tell what Homage will be pleaſing to GOD but He himſelf? Or in what Way the Creature ſhall attend upon him for the Obtainment of any ſpiritual Bleſſing but He himſelf? Can a <hi>Creature</hi> connect a divine Bleſſing with any of its own invented Methods of Worſhip? Or oblige him to be pleaſed or diſpleaſed in any other Way, or upon any other Terms, but thoſe himſelf has made and propoſed, and which are all manifeſtly contained in the <hi>Scriptures?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection,</hi> If it ſhould be here <hi>objected,</hi> That although CHRIST has inſtituted every Part of religious Worſhip; yet the <hi>particular Mode</hi> or Manner wherein ſome of thoſe Acts are to be attended he has not ſpecially pointed out, which therefore muſt be determined in order to perform the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Act of Worſhip: And why therefore may not the <hi>civil</hi> Authority determine <hi>ſuch Modes</hi> of Worſhip as well as <hi>eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical</hi> Rulers?</p>
            <p>I know very well, ſome are fond of that Notion, that the <hi>Church</hi> (by which they mean the <hi>Church Officers</hi> or <hi>eccleſiaſtical Rulers</hi> in ſome Form or other conſider'd and acting) has Power to decree <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> in Religion: and I am as willing for the preſent to allow the <hi>civil</hi> Authority has as much Power to do it, as thoſe <hi>eccleſiaſtical</hi> Rulers;—becauſe for any Thing I can tell at preſent, my Neck might be as eaſy under the Uſurpation of a <hi>civil</hi> Ruler, as an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> one: But <hi>neither of 'em</hi> have any Power of determining in the Caſe ſuppoſed.</p>
            <p>As to <hi>eccleſiaſtical</hi> Rulers, CHRIST has preciſely bounded their Authority. They are to do what he has bid them, they are to open and explain their LORD'S Will to others, or in a Word to teach Men CHRIST'S Laws. For this I appeal to their <hi>Commiſſion, Math.</hi> 28. 20. And as this bounds their Authority on the one Side, ſo it draws the Line or Bound of Submiſſion on the other. When they teach us the Mind and Will of CHRIST our common Lord and Maſter; we are to hearken with Deference to them: but if they get out of that
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005520_0017_10184CB94B1FC358"/>
Line, and teach (or decree, I care not what you call it) ſome Thing that is <hi>not</hi> his Will, ſomething to be <hi>neceſſary</hi> for me to do in Religion which CHRIST has not made ſo; no Regard is due to them therein. And I ſuppoſe I may venture to ſay, <hi>no one Ceremony</hi> in Religion or <hi>Modality</hi> of any Act of inſtituted Worſhip, that has been deviſed and decreed by any ſince the Apoſtles Days as neceſſary, excluſive of any other, either was or is <hi>really neceſſary</hi> for a Chriſtian to do in attending theſe Acts of Religion or Parts of inſtituted Worſhip: At leaſt I know of no one: to be ſure ſuch as have been the Subjects of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate between the <hi>Church of England</hi> on the one Side and the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> from that <hi>Eſtabliſhment</hi> on the othe; are <hi>unneceſſary.</hi> The decreeing ſuch <hi>unneceſſary Modalities</hi> of Religion therefore are without any Warrant from CHRIST: They teach therein what he has not commanded them, and no Chriſtian is bound to regard them therein.</p>
            <p>But that the <hi>Objection</hi> may have a full and clear <hi>Anſwer,</hi> I offer a few Words farther.—The <hi>Objection</hi> ſuppoſes, that the <hi>Mode</hi> of performing ſome Acts of inſtituted Worſhip is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by CHRIST, which muſt therefore be determined by <hi>Man</hi> in order to perform ſuch Act of Worſhip.</p>
            <p>To which I ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. If there be <hi>ſeveral Modes</hi> wherein ſuch Act or Acts of inſtituted Worſhip may be performed, Man may not determine the one excluſive of the other; and if there be <hi>but one Mode</hi> wherein it can be attended, there is indeed no Occaſion for a Determination upon it, all muſt of Neceſſity agree in ſuch a Mode of performing it. But in the former Caſe, no Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination may be made that it ſhall be performed only after ſuch a particular Mode, when it may be performed after another Manner as well. As for Inſtance, <hi>Public Prayer</hi> may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed either <hi>ſtanding</hi> or <hi>kneeling:</hi> it being ſuppoſed that CHRIST has not determined the one Mode or the other; in ſuch Caſe Man may not determine that it ſhall be performed only ſtanding, or only kneeling; the Worſhippers muſt be left to their Liberty as CHRIST has left it: For it being the only Reaſon why Man may determine any Thing relating to an Act of Religion or divine Worſhip, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of ſuch a Determination in order to the obeying a Law of CHRIST; then it is certain, where that Neceſſity is not found (as in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Caſe) there no ſuch excluſive Determination may be made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> theſe Matters of divine Worſhip, CHRIST'S Officers have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005520_0018_10184CBADCEA2538"/>
to do but to teach CHRIST'S Laws; and Chriſtians no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but to obey CHRIST'S Laws. It is therefore certain, that if all CHRIST'S Laws relating thereto may be obſerved, without the Determination of this or the other Ceremony or Mode of attending them; then the Determination of this or the other Ceremony as a Rule of Action for Chriſtians, falls not within the Compaſs of the Power of Man or any Order of Men. And I think the keeping to this Rule alone, that Man's Power in theſe Matters extends no farther than to a Determination of thoſe Things <hi>neceſſary</hi> to be determined in order to the performing of CHRIST'S Commands, is the only Way to preſerve CHRIST'S Worſhip in its <hi>Purity.</hi>—Certain it is, that the going beyond it has ſadly polluted it, and occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Diviſions and Abundance of ſinful Strife.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In ſuch Caſes where any Thing is <hi>neceſſary</hi> to be determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in order to any worſhipping Aſſembly's obeying CHRIST'S Laws, the <hi>Power</hi> of ſuch Determination lies with <hi>ſuch worſhipping Aſſembly.</hi> It is a Law of CHRIST, that He be worſhipped in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Aſſembly on the firſt Day of the Week; which can't be done unleſs ſome <hi>Place</hi> &amp; <hi>Hour</hi> of the Day be fixed upon for that Purpoſe. If CHRIST had determined where and when the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping Aſſembly ſhould meet, Man could not determine any Thing in the Matter: But ſince CHRIST has not; <hi>Time</hi> &amp; <hi>Place</hi> muſt be determined by Man; elſe CHRIST'S Law in that Caſe could not be obeyed. And becauſe that Law muſt be obeyed, and can't be obeyed without ſuch a Determination of Time &amp; Place; therefore it is, that Man may determine them, and is warranted to do it.—And every worſhipping Aſſembly beſt knowing their own particular Circumſtances, and being beſt able to judge what may be convenient or inconvenient in the Caſe, are won't to fix Time and Place for the Purpoſe: And who has right to intermeddle in the Matter without their Deſire or Conſent, I can't imagine. This is a Right our worſhipping Aſſemblies Claim, and I know not that any call it in Queſtion. Now altho' in this Inſtance, wherein ſomething falls <hi>neceſſarily</hi> under the Determination of Man in order to Chriſtians obeying a Law of CHRIST, no Ceremony or Mode of Worſhip is concerned; yet as I apprehend there is <hi>greater Reaſon</hi> why every worſhipping Aſſembly ſhould be left free in an uninterrupted Enjoyment of this Right to determine the <hi>Mode</hi> of any Act of Worſhip (undetermined by CHRIST) where there is a <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of ſuch a Determination in order to
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005520_0019_10184CC178371D00"/>
obey his Laws: and that becauſe <hi>Conſcience</hi> is immediately concerned therein. As I have ſaid before, I know not of ſuch a Caſe. Yet if Chriſtians do apprehend there is any <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> every worſhipping Aſſembly muſt in that Caſe determine for themſelves. They may be under a great Miſtake in determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that to be <hi>neceſſary</hi> which may not be ſo: but herein I think no others have a Power to determine for them. Not the <hi>civil Authority</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> for the Reaſon before given, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> That the Ceremony or particular Mode of performing an Act of divine Worſhip, has no Relation to the <hi>Ends</hi> of a civil Society: The <hi>Preſervation</hi> of <hi>Perſon</hi> or <hi>Property,</hi> no Ways requires the giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up this Liberty into the Hand of the civil Magiſtrate. This therefore muſt remain in the Individuals. The civil Intereſt of a State is no more affected, by <hi>kneeling</hi> or <hi>ſtanding</hi> in <hi>Prayer,</hi> then by praying with the <hi>Eyes ſhut</hi> or <hi>open;</hi> or by making the Figure of a <hi>Triangle</hi> or a <hi>Croſs</hi> upon a Perſon in <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> than by making no Figure at all. They have indeed none of them any Relations to the <hi>Ends</hi> of a civil Inſtitution. The civil Authority therefore have no Buſineſs with it. Nor have the <hi>eccleſiaſtical Officers</hi> Authority to determine in theſe Caſes for particular Chriſtians; becauſe it is not within their <hi>Commiſſion.</hi> We have ſeen before how their Authority is limited, and what is the Bound of Submiſſion from particular Chriſtians. As they are CHRIST'S Officers, they have Authority to teach Men his Mind in Things pertaining to his Kingdom.—So they have no Authority to teach Men any Thing but the Mind and Will of CHRIST. It is a Truth that ſhines with a Meridian Brightneſs, that whatever is not contained in a <hi>Commiſſion</hi> is out of it and excluded by it; and the teaching <hi>his Laws only</hi> being contained in the Commiſſion, what is not his Law is out of it and by that Commiſſion they are excluded from teaching it, or forbid by it. The Power then of determining in theſe Caſes before us, muſt lie with <hi>every diſtinct worſhipping Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly;</hi> I don't mean excluſive of their <hi>Paſtor</hi> but with him And this I think is evident from the Right of private Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that every Chriſtian has in Matters of Religion. We have ſeen evidently that the <hi>ſacred Scriptures</hi> are the Rule of Faith and Practice to every Chriſtian; from thence each one is bound to learn what that Worſhip is which Chriſt requires from him, and in what Manner be is to perform it: And therein is every one to be perſwaded in his own Mind. In all the Worſhip he pays to GOD he is bound to act <hi>underſtandingly,</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:005520_0020_10184CC302154788"/>
which he can't be ſaid to do if he does not underſtand for himſelf, and perform it in ſuch a Manner as he judges moſt agreeable to the Mind of Chriſt, and ſo moſt acceptable to him. If another Perſon ſees for him, it will be but a blind Service that he will yield. <hi>Every one muſt give Account of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to GOD,</hi> to whom alone as his only Maſter he is to ſtand or fall: And it will be but a poor Account the <hi>Papiſt</hi> will have to give of all his <hi>ceremonious Worſhip,</hi> that the <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Prieſt</hi> directed him ſo.—How much farther will it go in that Day to ſay, the <hi>King,</hi> or <hi>Parliament,</hi> or <hi>Convocation</hi> directed me to pay ſuch or ſuch a Kind of Worſhip.</p>
            <p>But <hi>the laſt Thing</hi> included in this <hi>Corollary</hi> is, that <hi>civil Rulers</hi> have no Authority to determine for Chriſtians the <hi>Form of Church Government:</hi> and that for the Reaſons before given, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> Becauſe this would be going beſide the <hi>End</hi> of civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and becauſe this is already done by Chriſt. If his <hi>Word</hi> be a compleat <hi>Rule</hi> of Faith and Practice to the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian; it ſurely contains ſufficient Inſtruction in the Nature of a Church; what Kinds of Officers Chriſt has inſtituted, what their Work and Buſineſs is; what the Rights and Priviledges of the Church are, and on what Terms to be enjoyed; what the Diſcipline thereof is, and how it is to be adminiſtred. For that which is the Rule of Faith and Practice to a Chriſtian (as he is a Subject of Chriſt) muſt certainly be the Meaſure of his Faith and Practice: For that certainly cannot be the Meaſure of his Faith and Practice which contains any Thing more or leſs than he ought to believe and practice. Chriſt is the Head of his Church, a King in his own Kingdom; a Part of whoſe Royalty it is to give <hi>Laws</hi> to his Subjects; theſe are contained in the <hi>ſacred Scriptures,</hi> which are open to all for the learning and underſtanding of them. And ſo far are Men from having any Power of inſtituting or forming a Church for Chriſt, that it is their greateſt Honour to be <hi>Servants</hi> in the Houſe of GOD. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 5. This being Truth, that Chriſt has ſhown us what his Will is touching the ordering of his Houſe in the ſacred Scriptures; it then follows, that none either <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Caeſar,</hi> can have any Authority to preſcribe to Chriſtians how it ſhall be order'd, to form the Model or any Part of it.</p>
            <p>II. The next <hi>Corollary</hi> I ſhall deduce from the Principles before laid down, is, That the <hi>ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>il</hi> Authority have no Power to eſtabliſh any Religion (<hi>i. e.</hi> any Profeſſions of Faith, Modes of Worſhip, or Church Government) of a human Form and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005520_0021_10184CC5B04DCC88"/>
Compoſition, as a <hi>Rule</hi> binding to Chriſtians; much leſs may they do this on any <hi>Penalties</hi> whatſoever.—Religion muſt remain on that Foot where Chriſt has placed it. He has fully declared his Mind as to what Chriſtians are to believe and do in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Matters: And that <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>private Judgment</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to every Chriſtian evidenced in the preceeding Pages, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ſuppoſes it is every one's Duty, Priviledge and Right to <hi>ſearch the ſacred Writings</hi> as Chriſt has bid him, and know and judge for himſelf what the Mind and Will of his only Lord and Maſter is in theſe Matters.—It does, I think, from hence follow, that no Order of Men have any Right to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh any Mode of Worſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as a Rule binding to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Chriſtians. For if they may, then Chriſtians are abridg'd or rather ſtriped of their Right, which is to involve our ſelves in a Contradiction. For if <hi>A</hi> has a Right to <hi>judge</hi> for himſelf what his Maſter's Will is, then <hi>B</hi> can have no Right to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his own Sentiments concerning that Maſter's Will as a Rule for <hi>A.</hi>—For to ſuppoſe <hi>A</hi> has a Right, which <hi>B</hi> has a Right to take from him, is to ſuppoſe <hi>A</hi> has no Right at all; which is a direct Inconſiſtency. And to ſuppoſe <hi>B</hi> in ſuch Caſe has a Right to <hi>puniſh</hi> A for not receiving his Eſtabliſhment, is but to increaſe the Abſurdity.</p>
            <p>But here you will ſay, <q>Tho' they have no Authority to eſtabliſh a Religion of their own deviſing, yet have they not Authority to <hi>eſtabliſh</hi> a <hi>pure Religion</hi> drawn out of the ſacred Scriptures, either by themſelves or ſome ſynodical Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and oblige their Subjects upon (at leaſt) <hi>negative Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties</hi> to receive the ſame.</q>—This I ſhall endeavour fairly to conſider when I have obſerved, that if by the Word <hi>Eſtabliſh</hi> be meant only an <hi>Approbation</hi> of certain Articles of Faith and Modes of Worſhip, of Government, or <hi>Recommendation</hi> of them to their Subjects: I am not arguing againſt it. But to carry the Notion of a <hi>religious Eſtabliſhment</hi> ſo far as to make it a Rule binding to the Subjects, or on any <hi>Penalties</hi> whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſeems to me to be oppreſſive of Chriſtianity, to break in upon the ſacred Rights of Conſcience, and the common Rights and Priviledges of all good Subjects.—For let it be ſuppoſed as now pleaded, that the Clergy or a ſynodical Aſſembly draw up the Articles and Form of Religion, agreeable in their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the ſacred Scriptures, and the Reception of the ſame be made <hi>binding</hi> by the civil Authority on their Subjects;—It will then follow, That <hi>all ſuch Eſtabliſhments</hi> are <hi>certainly
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005520_0022_10184CC758514BC8"/>
right</hi> and <hi>agreeable to the ſacred Scriptures.</hi> For it is impoſſible to be true that any can have Right or Authority to oblige Chriſtians to believe or practice any thing in Religion <hi>not true</hi> or <hi>not agreeable</hi> to the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD: Becauſe that would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the <hi>ſacred Scriptures</hi> from being the <hi>only Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> in <hi>Religion</hi> to a Chriſtian. If the ſacred Scriptures are his Rule of Faith and Practice, he is oblig'd and that by GOD himſelf, to believe and practice accordingly. No Man therefore, or Order of Men can have any Right or Power to oblige the Chriſtian to believe or do any Thing in Religion contrary to, or different from, what GOD has obliged him: The Poſition of the one is the Removal of the other. This then is certain, that if this Propoſition be true, that a humane religious Eſtabliſhment is a Rule <hi>binding</hi> to Chriſtians, or that the civil Authority have Power to oblige their Subjects to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them;—then they <hi>are always right</hi> and <hi>agreeable to</hi> GOD'S <hi>Word;</hi> but the latter is not true;—therefore the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is falſe. Humane Eſtabliſhments in Matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, carry in them no Force or Evidence of Truth. They who make them are no Ways exempt from humane Frailties and Imperfections: They are as liable to Error and Miſtake, to Prejudice and Paſſion, as any others. And that they have erred in their Determinations, and decreed and eſtabliſhed Light to be Darkneſs, &amp; Darkneſs to be Light, that they have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed the Conſciences of Men, and corrupted the Simplicity of the Faith in CHRIST, many Councils and Synods and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of State are a notorious Proof. King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th's <hi>Parliament</hi> and <hi>Convocation,</hi> who eſtabliſhed the famous <hi>ſix bloody Articles of Religion</hi> in the Year 1540, had as much Right or Power to make a religious Eſtabliſhment <hi>binding</hi> to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as any <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament ſince.</hi> If therefore the <hi>civil Authority</hi> has a Power to make a religious Eſtabliſhment <hi>bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> to the Subjects; <hi>thoſe ſix Articles</hi> were <hi>true,</hi> tho' they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained abominable Abſurdities, and amazing Falſhoods; and the People were obliged to believe them, and thoſe who ſuffered for diſbelieving them ſuffered juſtly.—</p>
            <p>Perhaps you will here ſay; <q>Altho' they have no Authority to make an Eſtabliſhment <hi>contrary</hi> to Scripture; yet why may they not have Authority to make an Eſtabliſhment <hi>agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> to the Scriptures, that ſhall be a <hi>binding</hi> Rule to Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, without the Suppoſition or that Propoſition's being liable to ſuch an Inference from it (which I have made)

                  </abbr> That then their <hi>Eſtabliſhments</hi> are <hi>certainly right</hi> and <hi>agreeable to Scripture,</hi> or in other Words that they who make them muſt be ſuppoſed to be veſted with <hi>Infallibility.</hi>
               </q>—I will give then a Reaſon, if what already ſaid does not ſatisfy.—Let us then have but a clear and determinate Idea of the Subject we are ſpeaking of; and I think you will find the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion certain. This religious Eſtabliſhment that has this binding Force in it,—is either in the <hi>very Words</hi> of the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> themſelves; or in <hi>Propoſitions formed by this Body of Men</hi> we are ſpeaking of, which in their Judgment contain the true <hi>Senſe</hi> and Meaning of the Scripture.—There can be no other Senſe put upon it.—The <hi>former</hi> of theſe can't be meant; for that is the Scripture it ſelf which I am pleading is the alone Rule in the Caſe before us: Beſides 'tis a Vanity to talk of Mortals making the Conſtitutions of GOD ALMIGHTY to become a binding Rule to Chriſtians. So that the Point before us comes to this Propoſition, <abbr>

               </abbr> That the <hi>civil Authority</hi> have Power to make ſuch a religious Eſtabliſhment which <hi>they think</hi> is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Scripture, a <hi>binding</hi> Rule to Chriſtians.—Then it follows, that what <hi>they think</hi> to be the <hi>Senſe</hi> of the Scriptures, is the Rule for the Chriſtian: for that what they <hi>ſo lay down</hi> for the Senſe of the Scriptures ſhould be a Rule <hi>binding</hi> to Chriſtians, and that yet what <hi>they think</hi> is the <hi>Senſe</hi> and Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scripture, is <hi>not the Rule</hi> for a Chriſtian, is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.—It follows alſo, that what <hi>they think</hi> to be the true <hi>Senſe</hi> of Scripture, is <hi>certainly</hi> the <hi>true Senſe</hi> of it:—For to ſuppoſe, that what <hi>they lay down</hi> for the <hi>Senſe</hi> and Meaning of the ſacred Scriptures, is a <hi>binding Rule</hi> to Chriſtians, and that yet the ſame is <hi>not the true Senſe</hi> of Scripture, is a Contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; unleſs that Propoſition be falſe, that the <hi>ſacred Scriptures</hi> are the <hi>alone Rule</hi> of Faith and Practice to a Chriſtian, which is a ſacred Maxim with every true Proteſtant. So that if a religious Eſtabliſhment which <hi>they think</hi> to be agreeable to Scripture is a binding Rule to a Chriſtian; it is the true Senſe of Scripture, and the Suppoſal that they are veſted with Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to make their religious Eſtabliſhments a binding Rule to a Chriſtian, does neceſſarily infer their being inveſted with <hi>Infallibility</hi> too.—Again—to ſuppoſe any Thing <hi>not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> to the ſacred Scriptures can be a binding Rule in Matters of Religion to a Chriſtian is what no Chriſtian will aſſert; becauſe it deſtroys the Chriſtian's only Rule in Matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. The ſacred Scriptures alone (or what is agreeable
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005520_0024_10184CCE7858BA78"/>
thereto) are a Rule in Matters of Religion to a Chriſtian:—A religious Eſtabliſhment (ſay you) made by the <hi>civil Authority</hi> which <hi>they think</hi> to be agreeable to the Scriptures, is a Rule binding to a Chriſtian: Therefore (ſay I) ſuch a religious Eſtabliſhment made by the <hi>civil Authority</hi> which <hi>they think</hi> to be agreable to the Scriptures, is <hi>certainly agreable</hi> to them. Until theſe <hi>Contradictions</hi> can be reconciled—<abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr>—That which is <hi>not agreable</hi> to the ſacred Scriptures <hi>cannot</hi> be a Rule binding to a Chriſtian in Matters of Religion—and—this, That which is <hi>not agreable</hi> to the Scriptures <hi>is</hi> (<hi>or may be</hi>) a Rule binding to a Chriſtian in Matters of Religion; or—the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are <hi>the alone Rule</hi> of Faith and Practice to a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, and this—That <hi>ſomething</hi> which the <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Caeſar thinks</hi> to be agreable to the Scripture, <hi>is a Rule</hi> of the Chriſtian's Faith and Practice;—or the Scriptures are the alone Rule, and not the alone Rule of Faith and Practice to a Chriſtian;—or that which is a binding Rule to a Chriſtian in theſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is not a binding Rule to him:—Until theſe <hi>Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> can be reconciled, it will ſtand for a Truth, that if the <hi>civil Authority</hi> have Power to make a religious Eſtabliſhment which <hi>they think</hi> agreable to the Scriptures, a Rule binding to Chriſtians;—then ſuch their Eſtabliſhments are <hi>certainly agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> to the Scriptures, and ſo they inveſted with <hi>Infallibility.</hi>—So that inſtead of finding <hi>one</hi> infallible Man upon Earth (at <hi>Rome</hi>) we may find <hi>a Body of them</hi> in every civil State at leaſt throughout Chriſtendom, and why not throughout the Earth: For the civil Authority, conſidered as ſuch, muſt have equal Right and Power of determining in theſe Matters in every State.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay; <q>the <hi>Queſtion</hi> is concerning an <hi>Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> that is <hi>agreable</hi> to <hi>Scripture</hi> and therefore whether ſuch an one is not a Rule <hi>binding</hi> to the Subjects.</q>—I <hi>anſwer</hi>—It is no Rule at all; and ſo has no binding Force in it, as it is an human Eſtabliſhment: it's binding Force is derived from another Quarter. The <hi>only Reaſon</hi> why it is a Rule binding to a Chriſtian is, becauſe it is the <hi>Scripture,</hi> or the Will of GOD contained in the Scripture. What binds the Chriſtian in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion are <hi>the Words</hi> of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, and the Doctrine which is according to Godlineſs. This true Chriſtians receive out of a Regard to a much higher Authority than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to any Set of Mortals.</p>

If it be ſtill demanded; <q>But have not theſe <hi>Synods</hi> who draw up theſe Eſtabliſhments out of the Scriptures, or the <hi>civil Authority</hi> with them, a <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>judge</hi> of the <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Meaning</hi> of the <hi>Scripture</hi> in thoſe Matters, and ſo <hi>determine</hi> what ſhall or ſhall not paſs for <hi>true,</hi> and be <hi>received</hi> by the Members of the Community.</q>—I know ſome plead for ſuch a Power: And I think if a human religious Eſtabliſhment can be a <hi>binding</hi> Rule to Chriſtians; they muſt, either a <hi>Synod,</hi> or <hi>civil Authority,</hi> or <hi>both together,</hi> have <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>determine</hi> the <hi>Senſe</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> as now pleaded for: and if they have <hi>no ſuch Power,</hi> it is moſt evident their Eſtabliſhments can be no binding Rule to Chriſtians. But this is certain, they have no ſuch Power: The Pretence to it is a Spice of that Antichriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianiſm that ought to be baniſhed out of the World.—For that this very Suppoſition removes the <hi>ſacred Scriptures</hi> from being a Rule of Faith and Practice to private Chriſtians, and ſets up humane Determinations inſtead of them; inaſmuch as—<hi>that</hi> from which the Chriſtian receives his Information what he is to believe &amp; do, is evidently <hi>the Rule</hi> of Faith &amp; Practice in thoſe particular Caſes at leaſt; and in the preſent ſuppoſed Caſe, he is to receive his information from a human Determination. The Scriptures therefore are ſtruck out from being a <hi>Rule</hi> of Faith and Practice to private Chriſtians; and human Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations ſubſtituted in their Room.—However the Scriptures may be ſuppoſed or pretended to be the Rule to thoſe Bodies of Men who make thoſe Determinations; yet it is evident in this Caſe, the Scriptures are ſo entirely reduced into the Power of Man, that in Truth <hi>theſe Bodies of Men,</hi> or <hi>their Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> are render'd the only and compleat <hi>Rule</hi> to others.—A Tenet that ſuits very well at <hi>Rome.</hi> But to ſhow the Abſurdity and Wickedneſs of this Principle, that <hi>Synods</hi> or the <hi>civil Authority</hi> may determine the <hi>Senſe</hi> of Scripture <hi>for private Chriſtians</hi> as above ſuppoſed; let me add, That all, whether <hi>Popes, Councils, Synods</hi> or <hi>civil States,</hi> that have made their religious Eſtabliſhments, have always pretended they took the ſacred Scriptures for their Rule in making them, and that they are agreable to the Scripture. Upon this Principle, all theſe muſt be <hi>received</hi> in their Turns, and in the ſeveral civil States where they are made—For thoſe <hi>Synods</hi> (or in a Word) the <hi>civil Authority</hi> in thoſe <hi>ſeveral Ages,</hi> or <hi>States,</hi> have had all <hi>equal Claim</hi> to this Right of determining the <hi>Senſe</hi> of Scripture, and ſo of making theſe religious Eſtabliſhments. How very
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005520_0026_10184CD1A0F22C70"/>
different and contrary theſe have been, one to another; who, at all acquainted with Hiſtory does not know? That is Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in <hi>England,</hi> which is Truth at <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>France,</hi>—And that was Truth in <hi>England Yeſterday,</hi> which is <hi>falſe</hi> there <hi>to Day.</hi> And ſo a <hi>Man</hi> (I don't ſay a <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> for as that Means a Diſciple of CHRIST, and it can't conſiſtently mean any Thing elſe, is by this Principle baniſhed out of the World both Name and Thing) might <hi>Yeſterday</hi> walk to Heaven in a Path, which if walked in <hi>this Day</hi> wou'd lead him down to Hell. Alas what is the Chriſtian bid to <hi>ſearch the Scriptures</hi> for, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair <hi>to the Law and Teſtimony,</hi> as being the only Light to direct us in theſe religious and important Concerns; if it comes to this at laſt, that he muſt receive his Information and Direction herein, from ſome poor fallible Creatures. This Principle, that a humane religious Eſtabliſhment is a Rule <hi>binding</hi> to Chriſtians, does eternally militate with thoſe plain Commands of the ſupream Lawgiver; is big with the Abſurdities I have juſt hinted at, and numberleſs more; has proved the grand Engine of oppreſſing Truth, Chriſtianity, and murdering the beſt Men the World has had in it; promoting and ſecuring Hereſy, Superſtition and Idolatry; and ought to be abhorred by all Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>But if you demand again; <q>Is it not evident GOD has veſted them with ſuch a Power, ſince he has bid us, <hi>obey them that have the Rule over us,</hi> Heb. 13. 17. and <hi>that we be ſubject to the higher Powers: for that the Powers that be, are of</hi> GOD, Rom. 13. 1. Will it not follow, that if GOD re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires our Subjection to them, they muſt needs be <hi>veſted with ſuch Authority</hi> as is now pleaded for.</q>—It has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhewn that a Suppoſal that they are veſted with ſuch Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, neceſſarily ſuppoſes they are veſted with <hi>Infallibility</hi> too; otherwiſe the Chriſtian lies expoſed to have a <hi>Rule</hi> of Practice in Religion <hi>different from</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD; which no Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian may admit of. If the ſacred Scriptures are the ſtanding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variable Rule in theſe Matters to every Chriſtian, (which is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conteſtible Truth) then he can't poſſibly lie expoſed to have any Thing elſe made a binding Rule to him in Matters of Religion; GOD has not ſubjected him in this Caſe to any other: and he may properly be ſaid to rebel againſt GOD, when he puts himſelf in Subjection to <hi>any other;</hi>—And the Thing now pleaded for, That an <hi>Order of Men</hi> are veſted with Authority from GOD to make any religious Eſtabliſhment which <hi>they think</hi> agreable to
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:005520_0027_10184CD6E40B3410"/>
the Scriptures, a Rule binding to Chriſtians, does neceſſarily ſuppoſe one of theſe <hi>two Things;</hi> that a Chriſtian may have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>different from</hi> the ſacred Scriptures for his Rule (i. e. That it is GOD'S Will he ſhall be in a State liable to be bound by a Rule different from <hi>his Word</hi>) which is impoſſible; or elſe, that theſe Men veſted with this Authority, are alſo veſted with <hi>Infallibility.</hi>—Now ſince it is moſt evident, they are not veſted with this <hi>Infallibility,</hi> it is equally evident they are not veſted with this <hi>Authority</hi> now pleaded for: and therefore no ſuch Thing is implied in <hi>thoſe Texts</hi> now adduced for the Proof thereof.—A great Duſt I know has been raiſed by the ſophiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Reaſonings of ſome Men from theſe Texts, who would erect a <hi>ſpiritual Tyranny</hi> over the Conſciences of Men. I will therefore diſtinctly conſider them, and ſhow that they no Ways ſuppoſe ſuch an Authority (as now pleaded for) is veſted in any Order of Men.</p>
            <p>The Text in <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. evidently relates to <hi>Church-Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers;</hi>—becauſe they are ſaid to <hi>watch for their Souls,</hi> which is not the Buſineſs of civil Rulers: and their being called in the Text, <hi>Rulers,</hi> will no Ways infer they have this <hi>Legiſlative</hi> Authority over a Church or particular Chriſtians; any more then <hi>Jair<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

They have no more Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in their <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> than what is to be found in <hi>Math.</hi> 28. 19, 20. where they are expreſly enjoined <hi>to teach People to obſerve</hi> CHRIST'S <hi>Laws;</hi> which neceſſarily excludes them from a Power of <hi>making</hi> Laws of their own for CHRIST'S Subjects. And the Reaſon given for our Obedience in the Text, does alſo ſuppoſe it; <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>for they watch for your Souls.</hi> By their <hi>adhering ſtrictly</hi> to the Will of CHRIST in their teaching Chriſtians, do they <hi>truly watch</hi> for the Salvation of their Souls; and therein are they to be attended to as the faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters or Ambaſſadors of CHRIST, in hearing of whom (when they do ſo) we hear him that ſends, as he elſewhere tells us
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:005520_0028_10184CD9E43AD378"/>
But if they <hi>go out of this Line</hi> in teaching Chriſtians, they then <hi>don't watch</hi> for their Souls, but for themſelves: and therein therefore no Obedience is due to them, even according to this very Text, which determines the Meaſure of our Regard to them, by their watching or not watching for the Salvation of our Souls.</p>
            <p>The other Text <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. no doubt relates to <hi>civil Powers:</hi>—A Text often wrecked and tortured by ſuch Wits as were diſpoſed to ſerve the Deſigns of arbitrary Power, of erecting a civil Tyranny over a free People, and as often wreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of their Hands by the Force of Truth. Tho' my Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs does not lie with <hi>civil Tyranny</hi> now, yet the Obſervation I ſhall make upon the Text will ſhow that neither <hi>civil,</hi> nor <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Tyranny is at all favoured by it.—Here then let me diſtinguiſh between <hi>two Things,</hi> which as they are really diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, muſt be kept ſo in our Minds, if we would underſtand the Apoſtle; <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> Between the <hi>Powers which are,</hi> and the Powers which <hi>are not.</hi> This is a plain and undeniable Diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſince it is well known there may be a <hi>pretended Power</hi> where there is really <hi>none.</hi> Now the <hi>higher Powers</hi> in the Text are the Powers <hi>which are.</hi> Since then it is expreſs and certain, that the Powers <hi>that be,</hi> are the Powers in the Text, the Powers <hi>which be of</hi> GOD, the <hi>Ordinance of</hi> GOD; it is only of <hi>ſuch Powers</hi> he ſpeaks of Subjection to. On the other Hand—the Powers that <hi>are not,</hi> are not the Powers <hi>that be;</hi> and ſo not the Powers in the Text, not the Powers that are of GOD, not his Ordinance, and ſo no Subjection to them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in this Text.—For <hi>Inſtance:</hi> The Powers <hi>that be</hi> in GREAT BRITAIN are the Government therein according to its own Conſtitution:—If then the higher Powers for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration rule not according to <hi>that Conſtitution,</hi> or if any King thereof ſhall rule ſo, as to change the Government from legal to arbitrary; the Power from GOD fails them, it is then a Power not in this Text, and ſo no Subjection due to it by the Text.—To apply this then to the <hi>preſent Caſe;</hi> we have ſeen before that civil Authority relates to the civil Intereſts of a People, (their Perſons and Properties) and is bounded by the ſame; that they can have no Power to make any religious Eſtabliſhment of their own deviſing, a Rule binding to Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians:—When therefore they attempt to do ſo, they get out of their Line, with Reſpect to which they are not the Powers <hi>that be,</hi> in this Text.

one,</hi> can't challenge any Obedience by Virtue of this Text. As this Text does not ſhew they have ſuch a Power, the Pretence of Obedience being due to them by this Text, if they ſhould be ſo vain as to fancy they have it, is a meer Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. The Truth of the Caſe is plainly this;—That this Text ſhews Obedience is due to civil Rulers in thoſe Caſes wherein they <hi>have Power</hi> to command, and does not call for it any farther: And when rightly underſtood affords not a Shadow of an Argument, of Obedience being due to them when they claim a Power in Matters of Religion which does not belong to them.—It appears indeed plainly, (tho' I need not ſpend Time upon it, in order to ſhow no Argument can be drawn from this Text in Favour of what it is now brought for, unleſs it be firſt proved from ſome other Text or Topick, that the civil Magiſtrate's Power does extend to the making any religious or eccleſiaſtical Eſtabliſhment a Rule binding to a Chriſtian, which never can be done, the contrary thereof being already demonſtrated) I ſay it appears from what the Apoſtle ſays in the 3<hi>d</hi> and 4<hi>th</hi> Verſes, that their <hi>Power</hi> is a <hi>limited</hi> one: and therefore the <hi>Obedience</hi> due is a <hi>limited</hi> Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.—<hi>Salus Populi eſt Lex Suprema,</hi> is the Apoſtle's Maxim; for he is expreſs that the <hi>End</hi> of all humane Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is the Good of the Publick.—That therefore ſets the Bounds to civil Authority, as ſuch, on the one Side, and fixes the Bounds of Obedience on the other.—The Ground of Obedience cannot be extended beyond the Ground of that Authority to which Obedience is required.</p>
            <p>Beſides, no Obedience is here required to be given but to <hi>ſuch Power</hi> as is <hi>from</hi> GOD: Until therefore it be ſhown that the civil Magiſtrate has Power from GOD to make any ſuch religious Eſtabliſhment (of which we are ſpeaking) a Rule binding to Chriſtians; this Text is in vain preſſed into the Service of ſuch as plead for any Obedience due to ſuch an Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment.—It muſt lie on them who plead this Obedience is due from Chriſtians,—to prove that GOD has veſted them with this Power. To pretend this Text for it, is <hi>begging the Queſtion,</hi> a taking the Point for granted which muſt be firſt proved; which I ſcruple not to ſay will never be done 'till we have a <hi>new Bible.</hi> For by this which CHRIST has given us, he allows us not to be reduced under any Yoke of Bondage, or to become <hi>the Servants of Men,</hi> not only allows but requires us to <hi>ſtand faſt</hi> in our Chriſtian <hi>Liberty,</hi> which ſubjects us in

our Faith and Practice to CHRIST alone; and by that very Thing exempts us from every other Yoke, and from all other Laws not given us by CHRIST. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 23. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 1. CHRIST perfectly knew the Weakneſs of humane Nature, and how apt Men are to aſſume Power over one another, even in Matters of a religious Nature, and how unfit they are to have any Dominion therein: He therefore charges and warns all his Diſciples and Followers againſt this great and dangerous Vice, which he knew would be very deſtructive to that Religion which he taught in <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 8, 9, 10. <hi>Be not ye called Rabbi; For one is your Maſter even</hi> CHRIST, <hi>and all ye are brethren: And call no Man your Father upon Earth; for are is your Father which is in Heaven: Neither be ye called Maſters; for one is your Maſter even</hi> CHRIST.

CHRIST'S Prohibition here is ſo ſtrong, of this dangerous Practice of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up or admitting of any other Rule or Judge in religious Matters beſides the Scripture, and of all Attempts to ſtrip Chriſtians of the moſt valuable of all Rights, even the Right of judging for themſelves in Matters of Religion, (directly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with which, is the Authority you have been now plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for in the civil Powers in the Caſe we have been conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,) that Chriſtians here (I think) may ſafely take up their Reſt, and be reſolved to give Place by Subjection, no, not for an Hour to any humane Authority on Earth in any Matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> leaſt they caſt Diſhonour on CHRIST their <hi>only Lawgiver.</hi>

               <hi>That every Law not contrary to a ſuperior Law, is to be obeyed;</hi>—which you ſeem to take for an allowed Maxim, and ſo think you may fairly conclude, that any legal Injunctions of the civil Magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate in Matters of Religion which are not contrary to ſome expreſs Law of GOD, are to be obeyed.—If that Propoſition be <hi>limited</hi> to thoſe Things which are the <hi>Objects</hi> of the civil Magiſtrate's Power, <abbr>

But if it be extended to Things out or <hi>beyond the Line</hi> of their <hi>Power,</hi> as Matters of <hi>Religion</hi> are; it is then a <hi>Falſhood.</hi> In the latter extenſive Senſe it ſeems you take it for a Truth, or you would not argue from it as you do. The Rule (then ſay you) to know whether a particular Law is to be obeyed or not is to conſider that Law in Relation to a ſuperior Law; and if it prohibits nothing which a ſuperior Law requires, or enjoins nothing which a ſuperior Law prohibits the doing of, then it is to be obeyed.—This (I take it) is a Principle invented for the Support of <hi>Tyranny,</hi> and induſtriouſly defended for the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of Tyranny of the <hi>worſt Kind,</hi> i. e. <hi>Spiritual:</hi> And if <hi>ſuch</hi> as are ſo mean as to <hi>flatter</hi> civil Rulers with Notions of exorbitant Power, and <hi>they only</hi> felt the Effects thereof in Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Slavery, the Chriſtian Church, and the World too, had been happier than now it is. Rulers have their Infirmities as well as their Subjects, and are too often carried away by the Stream of Temptation to play the Tyrant: And ſtill as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, the World affords many in it that love to have it ſo, and too many Aſſiſtants in forging the hateful Chains of Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and rivetting them on too if poſſible unſeen, whilſt they are induſtriouſly ſcattering falſe Notions of Power and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſuch ſtupifying Potions as this (you have now thrown in my Way) that they may effectually lock up the Senſes of thoſe whom they would enſlave.—But to return whence I have digreſſed.—This <hi>pretended Rule,</hi> as it holds not at all in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Religion;</hi> ſo it does not hold true in all other Caſes, even in thoſe that have no Relation to the <hi>End</hi> of civil Society, agreable to what has been already obſerved, <hi>Page</hi> 7. If civil Rulers ſhould take it into their Heads to make a Law, that no Man ſhall have <hi>Luther</hi>'s <hi>Table-Talk</hi> in his Houſe, that every Man ſhall <hi>turn round upon his right Heel at twelve of the Clock every Day,</hi> (Sundays excepted) or any ſuch like wiſe Laws (<hi>Thouſands</hi> of which might be invented by a wiſe Tyrant;) By this Rule theſe Laws are to be ſtrictly obeyed, a higher Law to the contrary not being found. And yet I think it may be preſumed, a free-born People can never become ſo ſervile as to regard them, while they have Eyes to ſee that ſuch Rulers have gone <hi>out of the Line</hi> of their <hi>Power.</hi>—There is no Reaſon they ſhould be <hi>Fools</hi> becauſe their Rulers are ſo.

Intereſts, (the <hi>End</hi> for which Power was put into their Hands) I ſay when it is applied to <hi>any other End,</hi> then (according to the great Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>) it becomes <hi>Tyranny.</hi> And ſince their Power would be as truly applied to another End, in making ſuch Laws as I have above hinted at, as in making thoſe that are notoriouſly unjuſt and oppreſſive, (tho' the latter is worſe;) then it as truly becomes <hi>Tyranny.</hi>—How long People are to bear with ſuch Tyranny, or what they may do to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from it, (I ſhould refer you to that Author in his Treatiſe of Government) were it at all needful to come into Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the preſent Caſe, as it is not; ſince the only Thing I had here to do, was to ſhow Obedience was not due to ſuch Laws, as I think I have done by ſhewing they had <hi>no rightful Authority</hi> to make them.</p>
            <p>Let me add a Word farther for your ſerious Conſideration; do you think that when the <hi>Edict</hi> went forth in <hi>Germany</hi> for the burning of all the above mention'd Books of <hi>Martin Luther</hi> (when <hi>eighty Thouſand</hi> Volumes of them were deſtroyed) did that good Man, who hid one of them under the Foundation of his Houſe whereby it was perſerved, <hi>Sin</hi> in not delivering up the Book? Or when the <hi>Proclamation</hi> went forth in <hi>England</hi> in King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Eight</hi>'s Time, that <hi>Wickliff's, Tindall's,</hi> and many other Books, ſhould on certain Penalties be deliver'd up to be burned; did thoſe good People <hi>ſin,</hi> who refus'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them up? By the Rule you are pleading for, I ſee not but that you muſt charge <hi>Sin</hi> upon them for not obeying;—when yet I believe you cannot but in Conſcience acquit them; and if you do, it muſt then be upon the Principles I have laid down.</p>
            <p>But I will no longer dwell here, it being ſomewhat foreign to the Point in Hand. I proceed to conſider <hi>this Rule</hi> as it reſpects <hi>religious</hi> Matters; to which it is ſo confidently applied by the Lovers of <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Tyranny.—And here, if this be the Rule, that we ought to obey human Laws in <hi>religious</hi> Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in <hi>every Inſtance</hi> where we can't find a divine Law enjoining what they forbid, or forbidding what they enjoin; then it is evident, Religion is in Danger of being made a very burdenſome Thing. To <hi>Baptiſm</hi> you may add the <hi>Sign of the Croſs,</hi> the <hi>Salt,</hi> and <hi>Cream,</hi> and <hi>ſpitting</hi> in the Mouth, with a <hi>Hundred other Things,</hi> that a fruitful Imagination could furniſh out.—The <hi>Popiſh Wardrobe</hi> will yield ſome Furniture to dreſs up Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion with. But the Inventions of Men may ſtill go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond. And if they do but take Care not to enjoin any Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:005520_0033_10184CE6B2982DD0"/>
or Modality in Religion not prohibited by ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in the Bible; by this Rule Chriſtians are bound to obey. It is a <hi>neceſſary Conſequence</hi> of <hi>this Principle,</hi> that <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are ſubjected to a heavier Yoke than the <hi>Jews</hi> were under the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Diſpenſation. If you ſay, <q>
                  <hi>not;</hi> becauſe if the civil Rulers ſhould proceed ſo far (for I know not what elſe you can deviſe to ſay,) it would be contrary to a <hi>general Law</hi> we have from CHRIST; Gal. 5. 1. <hi>Be not intangled again with the Yoke of Bondage;</hi> which not only ſhows <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are not ſubjected to that particular Yoke, but alſo that their Yoke is not to be ſo heavy as that was; ſo that if they ſhould increaſe their Injunctions to make Religion now ſo burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, as the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> was, it would be contrary to this ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Law.</q>—Be it ſo, but then remember this is true upon their Principles, that if they ſtop but <hi>one Hair</hi> ſhort, they will tell you, their Injunctions are not contrary to this general Law. If the Burden they lay upon you be <hi>at all leſs,</hi> by your Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple you confeſs yourſelf under the Obligation of Obedience; and how miſerable Chriſtians would be if human Law givers might go <hi>near</hi> ſuch a Length, I need not ſpend any Time to ſhow, it is ſo very obvious.—But farther, ſuppoſe civil Rulers ſhould go ſtill <hi>beyond;</hi> who are <hi>the Judges</hi> whether they go con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this Law or not?—Are the <hi>Rulers</hi> the Judges, or have <hi>private Chriſtians</hi> a Right of Judgment in this Caſe? If the <hi>Rulers</hi> only are to judge, we may be ſure they will judge in Favour of their own Laws: if they exceed this Bound you ſuppoſe ſet to them by this general Law;—they will never judge that Law of CHRIST to be contrary to their Laws: and if ſo, more miſerable yet is the <hi>Chriſtian'</hi>s Condition. But if you ſay, <hi>private Chriſtians</hi> have a Right of Judgment for themſelves in this Caſe;—I then aſk, if they judge the Rulers in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions exceed the Bounds allowed by this Law of CHRIST, whether they are to be <hi>tollerated</hi> by the Rulers in their not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming to thoſe Injunctions they judge contrary to this Law? They have gone as far (it is to be ſuppoſed) in conforming, as their Conſciences will ſuffer them: Are they then to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged to ſtop there according to their own Judgments, or muſt they ſtill conform farther, or elſe be ſubjected to a <hi>Penalty</hi> for not going farther? If they muſt be ſubjected to <hi>Penalties</hi> for not conforming in this Caſe; how deplorable is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Chriſtians? Obey the Inventions of Men or dye!—You will doubtleſs anſwer; they muſt be <hi>tollerated,</hi> ſince it is
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:005520_0034_10184CE860FFE428"/>
ſuppoſed they have a <hi>Right of judging</hi> for <hi>themſelves,</hi> when a human Injunction in Religion is contrary to a divine Law. This is undoubtedly true:—for to ſuppoſe they have a Right of <hi>Judgment</hi> for themſelves, is to ſuppoſe they have a Right to <hi>act</hi> according to their Judgment: and therefore none (not the civil Magiſtrate) can have any Right to hinder them. A Right that in this Caſe is dependent on the Will of another, is no Right at all. Suppoſe then, <hi>private Chriſtians</hi> ſhould judge that it is contrary to the Will of CHRIST expreſs'd in that Text, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 1. that the civil Magiſtrate ſhould make <hi>any legal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction at all in Religion</hi> (which is the Truth of the Caſe;) I then aſk, whether <hi>theſe</hi> who <hi>ſo judge</hi> are not to be allowed to <hi>act</hi> according to their Judgment, as well as the <hi>former?</hi> This ſurely can't be denied them; ſince the <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>private Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> belongs to the <hi>latter</hi> as well as the <hi>former.</hi> If then Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians have a Right to adhere ſtrictly to the Will of CHRIST de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in the ſacred Scriptures in every Thing relating to their Faith and Practice in <hi>Religion,</hi> excluſive of all human legal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions; then no Power on Earth can have any Right to make a Law to reſtrain them therefrom, or to add the leaſt Thing thereto.—For to have a Right to adhere to the ſacred <hi>Scriptures</hi> alone as a Rule in this Caſe, and not to have ſuch a Right is a Contradiction:—and ſo ſuppoſe the civil Magiſtrate has a Right to reſtrain them, or to add any one Law to CHRIST'S in this Caſe, is to ſuppoſe Chriſtians have not a Right to adhere to the ſacred Scriptures as their alone Rule. The Suppoſition therefore of any rightful Power in the civil Ruler to make any one Law in Matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> involves in it as plain a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to Truth, as a Right to a Thing and no Right to it does.—The Rule therefore which you would ſet up, by which to try what humane Laws in Matters of <hi>Religion</hi> are to be obeyed, is juſtly to be rejected; not only becauſe it ſubjects Chriſtians to an intollerable Yoke (if admitted,) but becauſe it can in no Inſtance be admitted, but at the Expence of a Chriſtian's <hi>natural and unalienable Right</hi> of <hi>private Judgment</hi> in Matters of <hi>Religion.</hi>—It may do well enough to <hi>amuſe</hi> Men with a <hi>Pretence</hi> they have found out a Rule how far Chriſtians ought to obey the Laws of civil Rulers in Matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> and where they may ſafely ſtop; where they can find Perſons ſo weak as to think that civil Rulers have ſome Power to make Laws in theſe Matters:—But if that be the Truth that they have no Power at all to make any Law in theſe Caſes, then the
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:005520_0035_10184CECE665A6A0"/>
ſetting up ſuch a Rule is a grand Abſurdity. Now I have ſhown evidently before, that the <hi>civil Magiſtrate</hi> can have no ſuch Power, that his Power relates to the <hi>civil Intereſts</hi> of a People, and is bounded thereby—that the <hi>ſacred Scriptures</hi> are the alone Rule of Faith and Practice in Religion to a Chriſtian; that the Right of private Judgment, what the Chriſtian is to believe and do in Religion according to that Rule, is his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and unalienable Right; ſo that he neither really may nor can give up his Soul, his Conſcience in theſe Matters to the Controul of human Laws. And the Truth is, the civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate is ſo far from having a rightful Power in theſe Caſes, to make Laws for CHRIST'S Subjects; that in doing ſo, he violates the fundamental Priviledge of the Goſpel, the Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right of Believers, Chriſtian Liberty. 2 Cor. 3. 17. <hi>Where the</hi> SPIRIT <hi>of the</hi> LORD <hi>is, there is Liberty,</hi> Gal. 4. 31. <hi>We are no, Children of the Bondwoman, but of the Free.</hi> It is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to ſuppoſe that GOD by his ſpecial Grace in the Goſpel ſhould free us from the Bondage of Ceremonies, his own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, in theſe Things, and ſubject us to a more grevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Yoke, the Commandments of Men.—Nor has he given us this Gift only as a ſpecial Priviledge and Excellence of the free Goſpel above the ſervile Law; but has ſtrictly commanded us to keep and enjoy it.—<hi>You are called to Liberty,</hi> Gal. 5. 13.—1 Cor. 7. 23. <hi>Be not ye the Servants of Men,</hi> Gal. 5. 1. <hi>Stand faſt in the Liberty wherewith Chriſt has made us free.</hi> A Command accompany'd with the weightieſt Reaſons. Rom. 14. 9. 10. <hi>For to this End</hi> CHRIST <hi>both died and roſe and revived, that he might be LORD, both of the Dead and Living. But why doſt thou judge thy Brother,</hi> &amp;c. How preſumeſt thou to be <hi>his Lord?</hi> To be whoſe <hi>only Lord,</hi> at leaſt in theſe Things, CHRIST both died and roſe and lived again—<hi>We ſhall all ſtand before the Judgment Seat of</hi> CHRIST. Why pretend you then to be <hi>a Lord, a Judge,</hi> in theſe Things, for which we are to be accountable to the Tribunal of CHRIST only, our Lord and Lawgiver? Who in ſo many expreſs Words, has told us we ſhall have <hi>himſelf only</hi> our <hi>Maſter</hi> in Religion, Math. 23.8, 9, 10.—<hi>One is your Maſter even</hi> CHRIST. By all which I think it is evident, that for Men to exerciſe ſuch a Power in religious Matters as you have been pleading for, is not only a Violation of the Rights of Chriſtians, whoſe Souls in Matters of Religion are S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="34" facs="unknown:005520_0036_10184CF0B4C5E340"/>
of the royal Power of CHRIST, who is the ſole Legiſlator in his own Kingdom.</p>
            <p>To illuſtrate and clear this Point, let me bring it down to a plain and familiar Inſtance. Let it be ſuppoſed a humane Law is made, that <hi>the Sign of a Croſs</hi> ſhall be made upon a Perſon's Forehead, after the Uſe of Water <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in <hi>Baptiſm,</hi>—ſo that none ſhall be admitted to Baptiſm but who ſubmit to this Manner of Adminiſtration of it: or a Law requiring all who attend the Ordinance of the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> to do it in a <hi>kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Poſture:</hi> and let it be ſuppoſed, that there is no particular Law to the contrary in the Goſpel forbidding thoſe Actions. Now according to the Rule you plead for, (on the Suppoſition now made,) Chriſtians are bound to obey theſe Laws. Now the contrary is evident. For it has been already demonſtrated, that every Chriſtian has a Right to adhere to the <hi>ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> as the only Rule of his Faith and Practice in Religion; and that the Right of private Judgment, what he is to believe and do in Religion according to that Rule, is really unaliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: he can't therefore be bound to yield any Obedience to ſuch Laws of Man, unleſs he be obliged to yield up an unaliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Right, which is a Contradiction. Beſides—If the making ſuch Laws are an Invaſion of CHRIST'S Authority; how is it poſſible the Propoſition ſhould be true, that a Chriſtian is obliged to obey them, unleſs the Chriſtian has two Maſters in Religion, contrary to <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 8, 9, 10.—Where there is no Authority to command in Matters of Religion, there a Chriſtian is under no Obligation from ſuch Laws to obey: But in the Caſe before us, ſuch Laws are not only enjoined without Authority, but they interfere with CHRIST'S Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: So that a Chriſtian is indeed very far from being bound to obey them.</p>
            <p>Unto what has been already ſaid that will ſhew this, I ſhall add but a few Words. CHRIST has in the <hi>Goſpel Charter</hi> made a Grant of certain <hi>Privileges</hi> to thoſe who would be, and do approve themſelves his Subjects.—To them he has granted the Privilege of attending on him in the <hi>Ordinances</hi> he has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, for the conveying the ſanctifying Graces of his SPIRIT to their Souls, to prepare them for the Inheritance he has pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed and ſecured by Promiſe to ſuch as believe in and obey him.—As this is clear and certain in the Nature of the Thing it ſelf, that the <hi>Grantor</hi> of a <hi>Privilege</hi> has the ſole Right of fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Condition</hi> on which the Privilege ſhall be enjoyed by the
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:005520_0037_10184CF23AFC8E30"/>
               <hi>Grantee;</hi> ſo it is equally certain, that if any other attempts in the leaſt Meaſure to alter the <hi>Condition</hi> on which ſuch <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege</hi> is to be enjoyed by the Grant, he does therein <hi>invade</hi> the indiſputable Right of the Grantor. Now in the Caſe before us—there can't be a clearer Truth, than—that this is Chriſt's ſole Prerogative to make the Grant and fix the <hi>Conditions</hi> on which the <hi>Privileges</hi> are to be enjoyed, and that this is done in the Goſpel Charter. The <hi>Privileges</hi> are <hi>granted</hi> on the <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> that are written in the Charter. The Privileges are not granted on certain Conditions to be invented by Men after the making of the Charter:—For that would ſuppoſe that <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wiſdom</hi> has granted certain Privileges to Chriſtians on ſuch <hi>Conditions</hi> as <hi>humane Weakneſs</hi> eſtabliſhes; and that Chriſt ſtrips himſelf of his Royalty to cloath a mere Creature with it, and makes the Creature the Director of his Bequeſts: To ſuppoſe which of Chriſt is to diſhonour him with a Witneſs. It is indeed the greateſt Abſurdity imaginable, to ſuppoſe this Matter could be ſettled by any other than Chriſt himſelf, who makes the Grant: And the <hi>Conditions</hi> lie as plainly in the Grant as the Privileges conveyed by it; That he who believes and obeys the Goſpel, has the Right to the Enjoyment of the Privileges belonging to a Subject of Chriſt.—This then being certain, that Chriſt has fixed the <hi>Conditions</hi> of Chriſtians enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Privileges, the Ordinances of the Goſpel;—it is equally certain, that Man and every Order of Men are exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Chriſt himſelf from any Authority in this Matter: So that if any Man or Order of Men make any Alteration in thoſe Conditions, or make any new ones; they do it not only without Authority, but againſt it, and therein controul Chriſt's Authority. To apply this then to the Caſe before us:—Since the making the <hi>above-mentioned Figure</hi> on the Perſon to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, or ſuch a particular <hi>bodily Poſture</hi> at the Reception of the Lord's Supper, are not fixed by Chriſt as the <hi>Conditions</hi> of Chriſtians enjoying theſe <hi>Ordinances,</hi> or by any Law of Chriſt made neceſſary in order to the Obſervance of theſe Inſtitutions of his; for <hi>Man</hi> to make them <hi>Conditions,</hi> without a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with which Chriſtians may not have the Enjoyment of thoſe <hi>Ordinances,</hi> is not only to act without Authority, but is aſſuming an Authority which only belongs to Chriſt: it being a practical Declaration that Chriſt's Subjects <hi>ſhall not enjoy</hi> the <hi>Privileges</hi> of the Goſpel upon the <hi>Conditions</hi> fixed in Chriſt's Grant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Which is therefore evidently an <hi>Invaſion</hi> of Chriſt's
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:005520_0038_10184CF5219A6EA8"/>
kingly Office, and an evident Violation of the Rights of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians. So that it is certain, Chriſtians are not only, not bound to ſubmit to ſuch human Laws, but do truly profeſs their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to CHRIST'S Authority, when they refuſe to do ſo.</p>
            <p>But if you ſay here; <q>altho' the Rule you have been plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for will not hold;—yet if every Thing relating to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and Order in divine Worſhip be not particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by CHRIST, why may not what is referrible thereto fall under the Determination of the Laws of the <hi>civil Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> and be warranted by that apoſtolical Precept, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 40. <hi>Let all Things be done decently and in Order;</hi> and ſo <hi>thoſe particular Inſtances</hi> I have mentioned be juſtly warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by that Precept? If ſome body muſt determine in ſuch Caſes, why may not the civil Rulers do it?</q> I anſwer—</p>
            <p n="1">1. If Chriſtians keep from <hi>Indecency</hi> and <hi>Diſorder</hi> in their Worſhip, they come up to the Rule given by the Apoſtle in the now mentioned Text; and this they may certainly do without the civil Magiſtrate's determining <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Thing about it. Chriſtians obſerved this apoſtolick Precept as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> before there was any ſuch Thing as a Chriſtian Magiſtrate to be found, as they have done ſince: And may do it as well to the ſecond Coming of CHRIST, without the civil Magiſtrate's intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling in this Matter (not to ſay with, more Honour to Chriſt and greater Peace in the Church, if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> forbears his Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.) So that it is impoſſible to get an Inference from this Text in Favour of the civil Authority's determining any thing by their Laws in theſe Caſes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If by what you would call <hi>Decency</hi> or <hi>Order</hi> in Worſhip be meant, either any Act or Mode of Worſhip, or any Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that has any Religion at all placed in it; then I ſay, no Man or Order of Men has the leaſt Authority to invent or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join any ſuch Thing: This would fall under our SAVIOUR'S Condemnation in <hi>Mark</hi> 7. 7.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Any ſuch Modes or Circumſtances of divine Worſhip which are ſuppoſed in this Objection left undetermined by Chriſt, may not be determined by any legal Injunctions of the civil Authority. And that—</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Becauſe ſo to do, would be going out of their Line; theſe Things don't lie within the Compaſs of the <hi>End</hi> of their Inſtitution: The civil Intereſts of the People being no Ways concerned therein, as has been ſhewn in the preceeding Pages.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:005520_0039_10184CF906154BF8"/>
(2.) The Suppoſition that ſuch Modes or Circumſtances of divine Worſhip may be determined by human Laws, does alſo ſuppoſe that the civil Authority may fix <hi>Terms</hi> of <hi>Communion</hi> for Chriſtians: What is thus ſuppoſed enacted by a Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is made a Rule of Action to the Subject by the very Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of its being made a Law; ſo that in this Caſe the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is to attend divine Worſhip, but according to a human Law; and is therefore <hi>excluded</hi> from the Benefit of divine Worſhip and Ordinances, in Caſe of a non-compliance with that human Injunction. This is the true State of the Matter with Reſpect to <hi>thoſe Inſtances</hi> I have juſt mentioned: And any the like Modes of Worſhip enjoined on Chriſtians by the Laws of Men, they are made the <hi>Terms</hi> of <hi>Communion</hi> to Chriſtians, the <hi>Conditions</hi> of their enjoying the external Privileges of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians: And for Men to fix any <hi>Terms</hi> of <hi>Communion</hi> for Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians in this Manner, to make that <hi>neceſſary</hi> to their Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Privileges CHRIST has purchaſed for them which he has not made neceſſary, has been already demonſtrated an Invaſion of CHRIST'S kingly Authority.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) The civil Authority may not determine ſuch Modes and Circumſtances of Worſhip by legal Injunctions; becauſe this would interfere with the <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>private Judgment</hi> that belongs to Chriſtians. The <hi>ſacred Scriptures</hi> are ſufficient to furniſh the Chriſtian unto every good Work; they hold forth ſufficient Light about the Modes and Circumſtances of divine Worſhip, which in this Objection are ſuppoſed to be left unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by CHRIST. And it is the Duty and Right of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians to learn from thence, and judge concerning their Duty in theſe as well as more important Matters of Religion; and ſuch Determinations of them are lawful and warrantable as are according to the general Rules of Scripture given to direct us herein. And therefore there may be various Modes of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the ſame religious Duties that are each allowable and lawful: tho' ſome particular Circumſtances may make one more expedient to ſome Perſons than the other, and theſe alſo may be varied by the Providence of GOD. It is the Right therefore of Chriſtians, of every worſhipping Aſſembly, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine for themſelves theſe Modes and Circumſtances of Worſhip, as I have before obſerved. And for the civil Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority here to ſtep in and determine by a Law, what Modes or Circumſtances of Worſhip ſhall be obſerved; for <hi>Inſtance,</hi> what <hi>Poſture</hi> we ſhall uſe in <hi>Prayer,</hi> when there are ſeveral
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:005520_0040_10184CFBC29CFDB8"/>
equally expreſſive of our religious Reverence; interferes with the Chriſtian's unalienable Right of private Judgment. And when I ſay, <hi>every worſhipping Aſſembly</hi> has this Right of deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining or agreeing for themſelves about the Modes or Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Worſhip; it no Way ſuppoſes they have a Right to (or do by ſuch Agreements) exclude from their Communion any of their Chriſtian Brethren who may prefer the Uſe of a different allowable Mode of Worſhip. Whom CHRIST re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives they are alſo to receive. CHRIST has fixed the <hi>Terms</hi> of Chriſtian <hi>Communion,</hi> and none may alter them.</p>
            <p>But ſay you once more; <q>That the civil Authority muſt have Power to make ſuch religious Eſtabliſhment which I have been impleading, in order to have <hi>Unity of Faith</hi> and <hi>Uniformity of Practice</hi> in Religion. Theſe you ſuppoſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Peace and good Order in the State; and that this <hi>Unity</hi> &amp;c. is effected by ſuch a religious <hi>Eſtabliſhment,</hi> of which we are ſpeaking; and conſequently we muſt ſuppoſe them veſted with Power to make ſuch a one.</q>—Much Weight I know has been laid upon this Argument by the Lovers of <hi>ſpiritual Tyranny,</hi> and many ignorant unthinking People have been amuſed and deceived by it: But if we will look cloſely into it, it will appear lighter than Vanity.

It is notoriouſly known, that the <hi>Clergy</hi> of the <hi>Church of England</hi> are bound to <hi>ſubſcribe</hi> to the <hi>thirty nine Articles,</hi> i.e. to the Truth of <hi>Calviniſtick</hi> Principles: But has this <hi>Subſcription</hi> anſwer'd its End? Is it not known, that they ſubſcribe thoſe Articles in as widely diſtant and contradictory Senſes as were ever put on the moſt dubious Paſſage in the Bible. And the Truth is, if we conſider the almoſt <hi>infinite Variety</hi> with reſpect to the <hi>Underſtandings, Tempers</hi> and <hi>Advantages</hi> of Men for Improvement in Knowledge; it muſt be evident, that <hi>this Uniformity</hi> of Opinion and Practice in Religion, (as it has not) ſo it never can be produced by the Art and Policy of Man. A Scheme for an artificial Conformity in Aſpect, Shape and Stature of Body, is not a whit more ridiculous, than an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to depreſs and contract the Underſtandings of ſome, to ſtretch the Capacities of others, to diſtort and torture all, 'till they are brought to <hi>one Size,</hi> and <hi>one Way of Thinking and Practice.</hi> So that if this Unity of Faith and Uniformity of Practice in Religion is <hi>neceſſary</hi> to the Peace of the State;—then it follow, that the civil Authority have a rightful Power to put to Death or baniſh all that cannot in Conſcience conform to their religious Eſtabliſhment. It will be to no Purpoſe for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding this Conſequence, to ſay; <q>the civil Magiſtrate may not riſe ſo high, or may affix ſome lower Penalties for Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliance with his Eſtabliſhment:</q> For if this Conformity to his Eſtabliſhment be <hi>neceſſary</hi> to the Peace of the State, then the civil Magiſtrate has a Right to prevent a Non-compliance with ſuch Eſtabliſhment; and if leſſer Penalties will not do it, (as Experience has perpetually ſhown they will not) then they muſt riſe ſo high as <hi>Death,</hi> or <hi>Baniſhment:</hi> For a Right to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſuch Non-compliance, that does not amount to a Right to prevent it effectually, is no Right to prevent it at all. So that on this Hypotheſis, <hi>all Non-conformiſts</hi> to the religious Eſtabliſhment of any State, are to be rooted out by <hi>Death,</hi> or <hi>Baniſhment</hi> as faſt as they appear: Which both Experience and the Nature of Things evidence will be continual; the cutting off all that appear to Day will no ways hinder others from appearing ſo To-morrow. Whence it is but a <hi>genuine Conſequence,</hi> that civil Government is one of the greateſt Plagues that can be ſent upon the World; ſince it muſt, in order to keep Peace in it, be perpetually deſtroying Men for no other Crime but <hi>judging for themſelves</hi> and <hi>acting</hi> according to their <hi>Conſciences</hi> in Matters of <hi>Religion;</hi> (and ſo perhaps very often

the beſt Men in the State:) and all this in vain too, as to the propoſed End, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> Uniformity of Practice in Religion, that being for ever out of their reach.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Such Unity, or Uniformity in Religion is <hi>not neceſſary</hi> to the Peace of a civil State. Since God has formed the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Men ſo different, with reſpect to Clearneſs, Strength, and Compaſs, and placed them in ſuch very different Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; a Difference of Sentiments in ſome Things in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſeems natural and unavoidable: and to ſuppoſe this does in its own Nature tend to the public Miſchief of the State, ſeems little leſs then arraigning infinite Wiſdom. From thence will ariſe greater Reaſon and Scope for mutual For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance and Chriſtian Charity. But it will certainly be found on Reflection, that it has no ill Aſpect on the civil State. Have we not known Perſons of different Sentiments and Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices in religious Matters, as <hi>Preſbyterians, Congregationaliſts, Church-Men</hi> (as commonly called) <hi>Baptiſts</hi> and <hi>Quakers,</hi> all living in the ſame Community in Quiet and Peace with one another? I mention not <hi>Papiſts;</hi> becauſe tho' the Principles of a <hi>conſiſtent Proteſtant,</hi> naturally tend to make him a good Subject in any civil State, even in a <hi>popiſh</hi> one, and therefore ought to be allowed in every State; yet that is not the Caſe with the <hi>Papiſt:</hi> for by his very Principles he is an Enemy of Traytor to a <hi>Proteſtant State:</hi> and ſtrictly ſpeaking <hi>Popery</hi> is ſo far from deſerving the name of <hi>Religion,</hi> that it is rather a Conſpiracy againſt it, againſt the Reaſon, Liberties, and Peace of Mankind; the viſible Head thereof the <hi>Pope</hi> being in Truth the Vice-gerent of the <hi>Devil, Rev.</hi> 13. 2. To pretend that ſuch as own the ſacred <hi>Scriptures</hi> to be the alone Rule of Faith and Practice in Religion, can't live in Peace and Love as good Neighbours and good Subjects, tho' their Opinions and Practices in religious Matters be different, is both falſe in Fact, and a vile Reproach caſt upon the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which breaths nothing but <hi>Benelovence</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> among Men: and while it plainly teaches the Right of private Judgment in every one, it moſt forcibly enjoins the Duties of mutual <hi>Forbearance</hi> and <hi>Charity.</hi> That golden Precept of our bleſſed LORD: <hi>Whatſoever ye would that Men ſhould do unto you, do ye even ſo to them,</hi> Math. 7. 12, well taught and enforced by the Teachers of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, would (if I may uſe the Word) infinitely more tend to make Chriſtians of the ſeveral Denominations in the State, good Neighbours and good Subjects, then this whimſical
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:005520_0043_10184D048A69EC90"/>
Notion of Uniformity. Which if it had always had its due Force on the Minds of Men, we ſhould never have heard of the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of Uniformity in Religion to the Peace of the State, nor any ſuch legal Eſtabliſhment of Religion I have been impleading. That Precept being a ſacred Guard to the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienable Rights of Conſcience, which are always invaded by ſuch Eſtabliſhments.</p>
            <p>But if you ſay, <q>that <hi>different Sects</hi> in Religion aiming at Superiority, and endeavouring to ſuppreſs each other, form contrary Factions in the State; which tends to diſtreſs and thwart the civil Adminiſtration.</q>—I anſwer; The civil Authority's protecting all in their juſt Rights, and particularly this ineſtimable and unalienable one, <hi>the Right of private Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in Matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> is the beſt Guard againſt the Evil ſuppoſed in the Objection. Beſides, this is no more a <hi>natural Conſequence</hi> of Men's thinking differently in Religion, than of different Judgments about <hi>Wit,</hi> or <hi>Poetry, Trade,</hi> or <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or if you farther ſuppoſe, <q>that <hi>Religion</hi> is a Matter of much greater Importance than theſe Things, and demands therefore a more warm and active Zeal.</q> Be it ſo; No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing farther follows from thence, than that we ſhould endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſupport its Honour in a Way ſuited to its Excellency; to inſtruct one another in its grand Principles and Duties, and recommend it by calm and ſtrong Perſwaſion.—It is by <hi>Truth</hi> CHRIST'S Kingdom is ſet up, as he himſelf has taught us, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 37. And it is a moſt unnatural Exceſs of Zeal, for the pretended Defence of Religion, to renounce <hi>Humanity,</hi> and that equitable Regard and kind Affection, which are unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly due from one Man to another.</p>
            <p>If it be again ſaid, <q>that tho' theſe above-mentioned Evils are directly contrary to the true Genius and Spirit of the Chriſtian Religion; yet they are the <hi>actual Conſequence</hi> of a Variety of Sects, exceeding fond of their particular Schemes.</q> I anſwer; they are only <hi>accidental Abuſes</hi> to which the beſt Things are liable: The ſame Argument may be urged againſt <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>every Branch</hi> of natural and civil <hi>Liberty.</hi> It is equally concluſive as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have uſed it againſt the <hi>Laity'</hi>s having the <hi>Bible;</hi> 
               <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> the Conſequence of People's having the Bible in their Hands to read, has been the riſing up of a <hi>Variety</hi> of <hi>Sects</hi> in the chriſtian World, and therefore they ought not to be permitted the Uſe of it. As no ſuch Concluſion can
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:005520_0044_10184D0738B77C48"/>
be drawn againſt every Body's having the <hi>Bible</hi> from ſuch Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; ſo in the Caſe before us, no Concluſion againſt the <hi>Right of private Judgment</hi> for our ſelves in Matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> can be drawn from theſe Inconveniencies; which do not ſpring directly from it, but ariſe entirely from different Cauſes; from <hi>Pride,</hi> or fooliſh <hi>Bigotry,</hi> that either does not underſtand, or pays no Regard to the unalienable Rights of Conſcience.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Such legal Eſtabliſhments have a direct <hi>contrary</hi> Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to the <hi>Peace</hi> of a Chriſtian State. As the <hi>Exerciſe of private Reaſon,</hi> and free Enquiry in a ſtrict and conſtant Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to the ſacred <hi>Scriptures</hi> as the only Rule of Faith and Practice, is the moſt likely Means to produce Uniformity in the eſſential Principles of Chriſtianity as well as Practice; ſo this is certainly the moſt ſure Method of procuring Peace in the State. No Man having any Reaſon to repine at his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's Enjoyment of that Right, which he is not willing to be without himſelf; and on the ſame Grounds he challenges it for himſelf, he muſt be forced to own, that it is as reaſonable his Neighbour ſhould enjoy it. But then on the other Hand, <hi>every Claim of Power</hi> inconſiſtent with this Right, (as the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a human Eſtabliſhment of Religion of which we are ſpeaking) is an <hi>Encroachment</hi> on the Chriſtian's Liberty; and ſo far therefore he is in a State of <hi>Slavery:</hi> And ſo far as a Man feels himſelf in a State of Slavery, ſo far he feels himſelf unhappy, and has Reaſon to complain of that Adminiſtration which puts the Chain upon him. So that if <hi>Slavery</hi> be for the <hi>Peace</hi> of the civil State; then ſuch Eſtabliſhments as we are ſpeaking of, tend to promote the Peace of the State: <hi>i. e.</hi> what makes the Subjects <hi>miſerable,</hi> really makes them <hi>happy.</hi> And as it neceſſarily tends to the Miſery of ſome, ſo it alſo promotes <hi>Bigotry, Pride,</hi> and <hi>Ambition</hi> in ſuch as are fond of ſuch Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhments: which have from Time to Time broken out in Extravagancies and Severities (upon good Subjects) in Men of Authority and Influence, and into Rage and Fury, Hatred and Obloquy, and ſuch like Wickedneſſes, in the impotent and commoner Sort. This has been the Caſe in all Places, more or leſs, as well as in our own Nation. Thus when K. <hi>Henry</hi> threw off the <hi>Popiſh Tyranny,</hi> he would not deſtroy and put an End to the Exerciſe of that unjuſt Power, but only transferred it to <hi>himſelf,</hi> and exerciſed it with great Severity. The ſame unjuſt Dominion over the Conſciences of Men was again ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in the Reign of <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> who (tho' otherwiſe a wiſe
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:005520_0045_10184D08C5A68880"/>
Princeſs) yet being of an high and arbitrary Temper, preſſed <hi>Uniformity</hi> with Violence; and found Biſhops enough, <hi>Parker, Aylmer, Whitgift</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> to cheriſh that Temper, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote ſuch Meaſures. <hi>Silencings, Deprivations, Impriſonments, Fines</hi> &amp;c. upon the Account of Religion, were ſome of the powerful <hi>Reaſonings</hi> of thoſe Times. The Cries of innocent Priſoners, widowed Wives, and ſtarving Children, made no Impreſſion on their Hearts: Piety and Learning with them were void of Merit: Refuſal of Subſcriptions, and Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, were Crimes never to be forgiven. At the Inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that perſecuting Prelate <hi>Whitgift,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> the <hi>High Commiſſion Court</hi> was eſtabliſhed; which had a near Reſemblance to the <hi>Court of Inquiſition:</hi> (A fine Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to promote Uniformity) Which by the Cruelties practiced in it in the <hi>two following Reigns,</hi> was render'd the Abhorrence of the Nation; ſo that it was diſſolved by <hi>Parliament,</hi> with a <hi>Clauſe,</hi> that <hi>no ſuch Court ſhould be erected for the future.</hi> A Creature framed to promote the wretched Deſigns of ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors, was her weak Succeſſor <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, who gave the <hi>Puritans</hi> to underſtand—<hi>That if they did not conform, he would either hurry them out of the Kingdom, or elſe do worſe.</hi> The Biſhops ſupported by ſuch an <hi>inſpired King,</hi> according to <hi>Whitgift'</hi>s impious and fordid Flattery, purſued the Maxim to accompliſh Uniformity by Perſecution. The grievous Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities and numerous Violences exerciſed on Non-conformiſts in <hi>that</hi> and the <hi>next</hi> Reign, under that tyrannical Prelate <hi>Laud,</hi> (ſaid in Parliament by Sir <hi>Harbottle Grimſtone,</hi> to be <hi>the great and common Enemy of all Goodneſs and good Men</hi>) are well known by all truly acquainted with the Hiſtory of thoſe Times: As well as the cruel Injuſtice exerciſed <hi>after the Reſtoration</hi> on great Numbers of as good Subjects as any in the Nation; meerly becauſe they could not come up to this <hi>Uniformity</hi> pleaded for, and enquired according to their Meaſure of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge after the Truth, and deſired to worſhip GOD according to their Conſciences: until the late great Deliverer (WILLIAM the IIId. of happy Memory) of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation from <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery,</hi> freed thoſe miſerable Sufferers (noble Confeſſors for the Truth) from a Yoke of Bondage laid upon them, and gave them <hi>a Law</hi> for the Security of their <hi>Chriſtian Liberty;</hi> this <hi>Right of private Judgment</hi> I have been pleading for. And that this has promoted <hi>Peace</hi> in the State, Experience ſince has proved; as well as former Experience made it moſt evident,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:005520_0046_10184D0BC912C8D0"/>
that the Incroachments upon this Right of private Judgment, by ſuch legal Eſtabliſhments, have been exceeding prejudicial to the Peace of the State: It being impoſſible but that ſuch Methods ſhould cauſe and perpetuate Schiſms and Diviſions of the Church, and diſturb and diſquiet the State; ſince <hi>the Wrath of Man cannot work the Righteouſneſs of</hi> GOD; and ſince civil Puniſhments have no Tendency to convince the <hi>Conſcience,</hi> but only to inflame the <hi>Paſſions</hi> againſt the Adviſers and Inflicters of them. And as Hiſtory gives us ſo dreadful an Account of the melancholy and tragical Effects of this Practice, one would think, that no People who have any Regard for the Peace of the Flock of CHRIST, who know the Worth of Liberty, would be fond of ſuch legal Eſtabliſhments, or any ſuch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods as encroach upon Chriſtian Liberty, the moſt valuable of all our Rights.</p>
            <p>Thus I think I have fully anſwered all your <hi>Objections</hi> againſt my <hi>ſecond Corollary.</hi> I therefore proceed to a <hi>third.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. That the <hi>civil Authority</hi> ought to <hi>protect all their Subjects</hi> in the Enjoyment of <hi>this Right of private Judgment</hi> in Matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>worſhipping</hi> GOD according to their <hi>Conſciences.</hi> That being the <hi>End</hi> of civil Government (as we have ſeen) <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> the greater Security of Enjoyment of what belongs to every one, and <hi>this Right of private Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and <hi>worſhipping</hi> GOD according to their <hi>Conſciences,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>natural and unalienable Right</hi> of <hi>every Men,</hi> what Men by entering into civil Society neither did, nor could give up into the Hands of the Community; it is but a juſt Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that they are to be <hi>protected</hi> in the <hi>Enjoyment</hi> of <hi>this Right</hi> as well as any other. A worſhipping Aſſembly of Chriſtians have ſurely as much Right to be <hi>protected</hi> from Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation in their Worſhip, as the Inhabitants of a Town aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to conſult their civil Intereſts from Diſturbance <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Right I am ſpeaking of, is the moſt valuable Right, of which every one ought to be moſt tender, of univerſal and equal Concernment to all; and <hi>Security</hi> and <hi>Protection</hi> in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of it the juſt Expectation of every Individual. And the civil Magiſtrate in endeavouring and doing this, moſt truly comes up to the Character of a <hi>nurſing Father</hi> to the Church of CHRIST. If this had been <hi>protected</hi> as it ought to have been, what infinite Miſchief to the Chriſtian Church had been prevented? From the Want of a due Care of this, the <hi>Clergy</hi> through Pride and Ambition aſſumed the Power of preſcribing
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:005520_0047_10184D0D795E7E30"/>
to, impoſing on and domineering over the Conſciences of Men; civil Rulers for their own private Ends helping it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; which went on 'till it produced the moſt deteſtable <hi>Monſter</hi> the Earth ever had upon it, the <hi>Pope,</hi> who has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luged the Earth with the Blood of Chriſtians. This being the true Spirit of <hi>Popery,</hi> to impoſe their Determinations on all within their Power by any Methods which may appear moſt effectual: and thoſe <hi>civil Magiſtrates</hi> that ſuffered and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that <hi>Beaſt</hi> to invade this Right, did therein <hi>commit Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with her, and give her their Strength and Power;</hi> and ſo inſtead of proving <hi>Fathers</hi> to their People, proved the curſed <hi>Butchers</hi> of them. It has been by aſſerting and uſing this Right, that any of the <hi>Nations</hi> who <hi>have been drunk with the Wine of her Fornication,</hi> have <hi>come out from her Abominations:</hi> and would the civil Magiſtrates of thoſe Nations, who at this Day worſhip the Beaſt, but protect their Subjects in <hi>this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Right</hi> of <hi>every one's judging for himſelf in Matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> according to that alone Rule the <hi>Bible;</hi> that ſettled Darkneſs of Ignorance, Error &amp; Idolatry, which now involves them, would vaniſh as the Darkneſs of the Night does by the riſing of the Sun. How unſpeakably would the Advantages be, ariſing from the Protection of this Right, did they reach no further than to the Eſtates, Bodies, and Lives of Men?</p>
            <p>All <hi>Reformations</hi> are built on this ſingle Principle I have been pleading for, from which we ſhould never depart: yet it muſt be owned and deſerves to be lamented, that the Reformed have too much departed from this Principle upon which they at firſt ſet up; whence it has come to paſs that Reformations in one Place and another have not been more perfect. For the Prince of Darkneſs has always found Means this Way to make a Stand againſt the moſt vigorous Efforts; and if any Advantages have been gained in any Point, to ſecure a ſafe Retreat, by infatuating Men with that ſtrange Sort of Pride, whereby they aſſume to themſelves only, but allow to none elſe, a Power of domineering over the Conſciences of others. Religion will certainly lie under Oppreſſion if this unjuſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority be transferred, to <hi>Decrees of Councils, Convocations, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions of civil Magiſtrates,</hi> or from one Man or any Order of Men to another; as it is if we have any other Rule of Faith and Practice in Religion, beſides the <hi>Bible.</hi> It were eaſy to enlarge on the vaſt Advantages and Happineſs of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting no other Rule or Guide but the ſacred <hi>Scriptures</hi> only:
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:005520_0048_10184D11518B2660"/>
thence would flow the greateſt Bleſſings to Mankind, Peace and Happineſs to the World: ſo that if there be any Rights and Liberties of Men that challenge <hi>Protection</hi> and <hi>Security</hi> therein from the civil Magiſtrate, it is <hi>this natural Right</hi> of <hi>private Judgment in Matters of Religion,</hi> that the ſacred <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures only may become the Rule to all Men in all religious Matters,</hi> as they ought to be. In a Word, this is the ſureſt Way for the Eaſe and Quiet of Rulers, as well as Peace of the State, the ſureſt Way to engage the Love and Obedience of all the Subjects. And if there be divers religious Sects in the State, and the one attempts to offend the other, and the Magiſtrate interpoſes only to keep the Peace; it is but a natural Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to ſuppoſe—that in ſuch Caſe they all finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves equally <hi>ſafe,</hi> and <hi>protected</hi> in their Rights by the civil Power, they will all be equally obedient. It is the Power given to one, to oppreſs the other, that has occaſioned all the Diſturbances about Religion. And ſhould the Clergy cloſely adhere to theſe Principles, inſtead of their being reproached for Pride and Ambition, as the Sowers of Strife and Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Diſturbance of the Peace of the Church of God; they would be honoured for their Work's ſake, eſteemed for their Character, loved as Bleſſings to the World, heard with Pleaſure, and become ſucceſsful in their Endeavours to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Knowledge and Practice of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>IV. It alſo follows from the preceeding Principles, that <hi>every Chriſtian</hi> has <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>determine</hi> for himſelf <hi>what Church to join himſelf to;</hi> and <hi>every Church</hi> has <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>judge</hi> in <hi>what Manner</hi> GOD is to be <hi>worſhipped</hi> by them, and <hi>what Form of Diſcipline</hi> ought to be obſerved by them, and the <hi>Right</hi> alſo of <hi>electing their own Officers.</hi> (For Brevity Sake I put them all together) From this <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>private Judgment</hi> in Matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> ſufficiently demonſtrated in the foregoing Pages, it follows, that no Chriſtian is obliged to join himſelf to <hi>this</hi> or <hi>the other Church,</hi> becauſe any Man or Order of Men command him to do ſo, or becauſe they tell him the Worſhip and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline thereof is moſt conſonant to the ſacred Scriptures; For no Man has Right to judge for him, whether the Worſhip and Diſcipline of <hi>this</hi> or <hi>the other</hi> Church be moſt agreeable to the ſacred Scriptures; and therefore no other can have Right to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine for him to which he ought to join himſelf: This Right therefore muſt lie with every Chriſtian. As this is the Right of each <hi>Individual;</hi> ſo alſo of a <hi>Number</hi> of them agreeing in
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:005520_0049_10184D1441C5FAC0"/>
their Sentiments in theſe Things, to agree to obſerve the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Chriſt together, for their mutual Edification ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rules of the Goſpel, which makes a particular Chriſtian Church. And having voluntarily agreed together for ſuch an End, no Man or Order of Men has any Authority to preſcribe to them, <hi>the Manner</hi> of their <hi>worſhipping</hi> GOD, or enjoining any <hi>Form of Church Diſcipline</hi> upon them. So a <hi>Number of ſuch Churches</hi> (who are all endowed with Equality of Power) have Right to judge for themſelves, whether it be moſt agreeable to the Mind of CHRIST, to <hi>conſociate</hi> together in any <hi>particular Form;</hi> as far Inſtance, of <hi>Preſbyteries,</hi> or <hi>Synods,</hi> or the like. And if they ſhould do ſo, ſuch Agreements of their's cannot be made a binding Rule to them, by any Law of Man; As has been demonſtrated in the preceeding Pages. Theſe Churches are all of them as free to think and judge for themſelves, as they were before ſuch Agreement; their Right of private Judgment not being given up, but reſerved entire for themſelves, when they entered into any ſuch ſuppoſed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement. And if on Experience of ſuch a Method of Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as they have agreed to, and farther Light, they judge any of them, there is good Reaſon for them to forbear practiſing farther in that Form; they are not held to continue therein, but have Right to act according to their preſent Light; they having no other Rule but the ſacred <hi>Scripture,</hi> they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a Right to act their Judgment according to that Rule. So alſo if a greater or leſſer <hi>Number</hi> of Chriſtians in any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, ſhall judge another Way of Worſhip, or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Diſcipline, more agreeable to the <hi>Mind</hi> of CHRIST, than what is practiſed in that Church; they have <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw,</hi> and to be <hi>embodied</hi> by themſelves. As they ought to ſignify this Deſire to their <hi>Brethren,</hi> ſo <hi>they</hi> ought to <hi>conſent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> for they can have no Right to hold them to themſelves: and this without any Breach of Charity on either Side; or of after Communion, ſo long as they held to CHRIST the Head, and are agreed in the great <hi>Eſſentials</hi> of Chriſtianity. So alſo from the ſame Premiſſes it follows, that every Church or worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Aſſembly has the <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>chooſing its own Officers:</hi>—Tho' it may ordinarily be a Point of Prudence for a Church deſtitute of a Paſtor, to conſult Paſtors of other Churches where they may be ſupplied with a Perſon ſuitable for that Office; yet that no Way ſuppoſes, the full <hi>Power of Election</hi> does not lie with the Church. It is for the <hi>better improving</hi> their <hi>Power of
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:005520_0050_10184D4B0A065090"/>
Election,</hi> that ſuch a Method is ever to be taken, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have not the Power of Election in themſelves. Nor can they be bound to this, if they ſee good Reaſon to act other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, (as the Caſe has ſometimes hapned and often may.) <hi>Nor can they be at all bound</hi> to <hi>elect</hi> the <hi>Perſon recommended:</hi> They are to prove him themſelves, and be fully ſatisfied in his Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Gifts and Qualifications, and may herein be controuled by no Power whatever. It is their own good, their everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Intereſt that is concerned, and if they judge his Doctrine not agreeable to the ſacred Scriptures, that he is not qualified as he ought to be for a Goſpel Miniſter they have Right to reject him. As they have a Right of judging the Doctrines taught them them by the ſacred Scriptures, and of rejecting the ſame if not agreeable thereto, ſo it neceſſarily follows they have equal Right to refuſe ſuch a one for their Teacher, who does not teach according to the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>But if it be demanded how this Power can be exerciſed, muſt every Individual be agreed in the Perſon, or no Election made?</p>
            <p>I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Such a univerſal Agreement is not neceſſary, the Election may be made by a Majority. Experience has ſhewn where the Candidate has had the Goſpel Qualifications for the Office, the Concurrence in the Choice has been univerſal, at leaſt ſo general as to bring no Difficulty in the Exerciſe of this Right. So when there has been any conſiderable Number who judged they had any weighty Reaſon againſt the Election made by a Majority, Experience has alſo ſhewn the Majority's denying themſelves of that Choice, and trying farther, has iſſued hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily for the whole. In ſuch Caſes, 'tis certain, <hi>Wiſdom if profitable to direct.</hi> And that Rule of our Saviour's, <hi>Math.</hi> 7. 12. will go a great Way in keeping Churches in the peaceable Exerciſe of this Right.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Where a minor Part cannot in Judgment acquieſce in the Choice made by the major Part of the worſhipping Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, they have a Right to withdraw and chooſe a Miniſter for themſelves, or if not able to ſupport one may attend divine Worſhip in a neighbouring Church, where they find they may do it to greater Edification. They are all equally veſted in the ſame Right, and hold it independent one of another, and each one independent of the whole, or of all the reſt. So that the greater Number can have no Right to impoſe a Miniſter on the leſſer. It is not here as in civil Societies where the
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:005520_0051_10184D160C3E79C8"/>
Right of each Individual is ſubjected to the Body, or ſo trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the Society, as that the Act of the Majority is legally to be conſidered as the Act of the whole, and binding to each Individual. As to what concerns Men's civil Intereſts, there is nothing in the Nature of Things to hinder or prevent its being lawful or beſt, ſo to transfer their Power to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity. But it is not ſo in religious Matters, where Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Men's eternal Intereſts are concerned. If the Power of acting be transferred in this Caſe, as in that of civil Societies (now mentioned) Thus, if for Inſtance, the Majority ſhould elect an <hi>Arminian</hi> Teacher, the minor Part muſt be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by that Choice, as to ſubmit to ſuch a One as their Teacher, when at the ſame Time it may be directly againſt their Conſciences to receive ſuch Doctrines or ſuch a Teacher. But ſince the Rights of Conſcience may not be touched, the Right of electing a Teacher is not transfer'd to the Body by the Individuals, as civil Rights may be in civil Societies. That Principle or Suppoſition, which any Ways infer, an Infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Rights of Conſcience, cannot be true; as that does, which ſuppoſes a Majority may impoſe a Miniſter on a leſſer Part.</p>
            <p>If to avoid what I have aſſerted, that in ſuch Caſe a minor Part may withdraw and chooſe a Miniſter for themſelves, it be here ſaid—That they may remove their Habitations—</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, Since this Right of electing a Teacher for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves does truly remain with them, after the Choice made by the Majority, that Right may be exerciſed by them, and why not in one Part of the civil State as well as another? They are guilty of no Crime for which they ſhould be baniſhed by the State, nor of any Thing whereby they have forfeited a Right of poſſeſſing their preſent Freeholds: their Right to their Freeholds remains, and conſequently their Right to exerciſe their Chriſtian Rights where they be, and have a Right to remain.—It is to no Purpoſe here to ſay, Perhaps the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature has fixed the Bounds of the Pariſh.—For the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature can make civil Societies, and may fix the Bounds of Towns and Pariſhes for civil Purpoſes; yet they can't make Churches, nor may they make any Laws that interfere with the Rights of Chriſtians.—Nor is it to any Purpoſe to ſay, This would open a Door to a great Multiplication of Churches: For how many populous Places, as well as <hi>Boſton,</hi> have tried it, and found Religion and Peace beſt promoted on theſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:005520_0052_10184D1B878429F0"/>
nor is there a probability that Churches will by this Means be increaſed beyond their Ability to ſupport their Miniſters.</p>
            <p>By what I have ſaid you will find ſome other of your Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries anſwer'd, without my making particular Application, and therefore I leave that for you to do at your own Leiſure: And ſhould here finiſh my Letter, but that you inſiſt on my giving you my Sentiments on a Law made in your Colony <hi>May</hi> 1742, Intitled <hi>An Act for regulating Abuſes, and correcting Diſorders in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs:</hi> Which it ſeems, thro' the fond Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſome Perſons among you had of it, was thruſt into one of our publick News Papers, ſoon after it was paſſed; under which every wiſe By-ſtander, that was a hearty Friend to your civil and religious Intereſts, was ready to write, <hi>Tell it not in Gath</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not deſcend into every Particular that might be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered upon it—Some few Remarks may ſuffice.</p>
            <p>I. The Law is founded on this falſe Principle, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> That the civil Authority hath Power to eſtabliſh a Form of Church-Government by penal Laws. The Act relates wholly to Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of an eccleſiaſtical Nature: and as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſuppoſes, the civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate has Authority by penal Laws to regulate eccleſiaſtical Matters, ſo conſequently to eſtabliſh an eccleſiaſtical Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by penal Laws. It appears from the Preamble to the Act, that the declared Deſign of it is to keep Perſons from deviating from the eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline eſtabliſhed by Law, in the Year 1708 and that under the Penalties by this Law enacted.—But that they have no ſuch Authority, has been fully demonſtrated in the foregoing Pages, which I need not repeat. Whence it muſt follow, that the Act is fundamentally wrong, being made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Authority. Be pleas'd to reflect one Minute on this Power challenged by this Law, to correct, and that by penal Laws, ſuch Diſorders as are purely of an eccleſiaſtical Nature, and ſee the Conſequence of it. One Diſorder to be corrected is, A Miniſter's preaching out of his own Pariſh undeſired by the Miniſter and major Part of the Church where he ſhall ſo preach. If the civil Magiſtrate has this Power the Act ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, if he judges it to be a Diſorder for the Miniſter to preach in his own Pariſh on a Week Day, he may then reſtrain him: or if he t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ks it a Diſorder that there ſhould be any public Prayers but by a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

eccleſiaſtical Diſorders, he has a Right to judge what is a Diſorder in the Church, and reſtrain the ſame. If he may exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute this in one Inſtance, he may in another: and every Thing is on this Principle liable to be diſallowed in the Worſhip of God, which does not ſuit with the civil Magiſtrate's Opinion. Whatever he judges to be a Diſorder, is ſo by this Principle, and may be reſtrained accordingly. And ſo farewell all Chriſtian Liberty.—It ſignifies nothing to ſay, your civil Magiſtrates are ſo ſound in the Faith, there's no Danger they will go ſo far. I hope ſo indeed with you; tho' you can't tell what thoſe or others in ſucceeding Times may do. It is no new Thing for civil Authority to make dreadful Havock of the Liberties and Religion of Chriſtians; but the Argument, you ſee, proceeds upon the Nature of Things. The Principle, that Law ſtands upon, you may plainly ſee, is directly inconſiſtent in its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with the unalienable Rights of Chriſtians. What ſad Effects have been felt in our own Nation, in ſome former Reigns, from this very Principle's being put in Practice; who at all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Hiſtory can be ignorant? While they were exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting what they were pleaſed to call wholſome Severities on <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> they were only in their Judgment correcting Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders in eccleſiaſtical Affairs. If this Power belongs to the civil Authority, as ſuch, it muſt belong to thoſe in one State as well as another; and is as juſtly challenged by the civil Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in <hi>France,</hi> as in <hi>New-England.</hi> Let it be but once ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the civil Magiſtrate has this Authority, where can you ſtop? what is there in Religion not ſubjected to his Judgment? All muſt be Diſorder in Religion, which he is pleaſed to call ſo; you can have no more of the external Part of Religion than he is pleaſed to leave you, and may have ſo much of Superſtition as he is pleaſed to enjoin under the Head of Order. So that this Law ſtands on no better a Foundation, than what infers the Deſtruction of Chriſtian Liberty.</p>
            <p>Having made this general Obſervation, I go on, to conſider the firſt Paragraph, which runs thus—<q>That if any ordained Miniſter or other Perſon licenſed as aforeſaid to preach, ſhall enter into any Pariſh not immediately under his Charge, and ſhall there preach or exhort the People, he ſhall be denied and ſecluded the Benefit of any Law of this Colony made for the Support and Encouragement of the Goſpel Miniſtry; except ſuch ordained Miniſter or licenſed Perſon ſhall be expreſly invited and deſired ſo to enter into ſuch other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:005520_0054_10184D211F24ABE8"/>
and there to preach and exhort the People, either by the ſettled Miniſter, and the major Part of the Church of ſaid Pariſh; or in Caſe there be no ſettled Miniſter, then by the Church or Society in ſaid Pariſh.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Miniſter's heretofore ſuppoſed Right to have Aſſiſtance and Help from his Brethren in the Miniſtry by preaching, is hereby cut off. None may preach unleſs the major Part of the Church deſire it; tho' the Miniſter and one Half of the Church and all the reſt of the Congregation, which make up much the greater Part of the Number, who have Right to hear the Word preached, are ever ſo deſirous of hearing the Word from another, and apprehenſive (as the Caſe may be) of the great Neceſſity of it. Before this Law was paſſed, I ſhould have preſumed, there was not one Miniſter on the Continent, but what thought he had good Right to invite any orthodox Miniſter to preach in his Pulpit: not only Miniſters, but Churches in every Part of the World, have ſo ſuppoſed and practiſed. But it ſeems by this Law this Suppoſition is a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, and the Practice a Diſorder in the Church.—Yet if the Miniſter has no ſuch Right, how comes it to paſs, that the greater Part of his Hearers are cut off from any Right to hear ſuch as may be ever ſo well qualified to inſtruct. The Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicants, which perhaps makes three Quarters of the Pariſh, are in one Part of this Paragraph conſider'd as a Cypher, and in another Part as having full Right to hear whom they deſire, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>In a Pariſh where they have no ſettled Miniſter.</hi> In ſuch Caſe, it is ſuppoſed, by this Law, they have Right to hear any Miniſter they deſire, tho' not one Church-Member join with them in the Deſire; for they may make up a Majority of the Society without one Communicant with them.—Yet if the Day before, while the Miniſter of ſuch a Pariſh was living, it ſeems, if the ſame Perſons had been deſirous of hearing the ſame Man, they are by this Law cut off the Privilege; if the Miniſter's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e too had been joined with them, it would have helped no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: or rather (in ſhort) as this Law ſtands, this very Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of their having a Miniſter extinguiſhes their Right of hearing ſuch Preachers as they deſire. Such now being the plain Senſe of this Paragraph; I ſay then,—</p>
            <p>II. That it is apparently inconſiſtent with itſelf, deprives Miniſters and particular Chriſtians of their Rights and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and inveſts a lordly Power in a ſmall Part of a Pariſh-Society, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t or one Half of a Church, over a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:005520_0055_10184D22C8ACC788"/>
Aſſembly, ſince they never had nor can have any rightful Power to hinder other Chriſtians in the Pariſh from hearing ſuch Miniſters as they judge may promote their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Good, as by this Law they are enabled to do.</p>
            <p>III. It inveſts an exorbitant Power in Miniſters over a Church and Congregation. This may look very ſtrange, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when you reflect, that by the Preamble to this Law the Miniſters are repreſented as having departed from the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline, and been guilty of diſorderly and irregular Practices; and therefore are ſuch Perſons as are not fit to be left to conduct themſelves, in their miniſterial Office, nor to be governed by their own eccleſiaſtical Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, but muſt of Neceſſity be laid under ſome extraordinary legal Reſtraints. I ſay, they are thus plainly repreſented (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther truly, or not, is not the Queſtion) by the Preamble; yet, notwithſtanding all this, they are by this Law veſted with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant Power over the Churches. Chriſtians, it ſeems, muſt be ſtrip'd of an invaluable Branch of Liberty Chriſt has veſted them with, &amp; the ſame muſt be lodged in that Order of Men, who are repreſented as unfaithful in the Execution of their Truſt. For by this Law every Miniſter has not only Power given him, to prevent any other Minſter's preaching in his Pariſh, not only if a ſmall Number deſire it, but if the whole worſhipping Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly deſire it; not only in the Pulpit, but in any private Houſe, which is directly inconſiſtent with the Rights of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians: but alſo in Caſe a Pariſh be under a Neceſſity of ſettling another Miniſter thro' the Incumbent's Diſability to diſcharge his Paſtoral Office, it is put into his Power to negative any Choice they ſhall make of a Miniſter, and ſo Churches are really ſtript of their Right of electing their own Miniſters. It is plain by the Words of the Law, none can preach in the Pariſh without the ſettled Miniſter's Conſent: &amp; if one preaches to Day by his Leave, and the whole worſhipping Aſſembly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire his continued preaching, he has it in his Power by this Law to prevent his preaching To-morrow. And therefore if a Church can call and ſettle none (in ſuch a Caſe) but whom their preſent Paſtor pleaſes, (as is certainly the Caſe by this Law) the Right of electing their Miniſter is taken from them. A ſuppoſed Right in <hi>A,</hi> dependent on the Will of <hi>B,</hi> is no Right at all.—And this, as I have heard, is the Caſe of one Church on <hi>Connecticut</hi> River, now groaning under this Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which may alſo prove the Caſe of any, or of all other
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:005520_0056_10184D26D3C9E718"/>
Churches in that Colony, if they remain under the Miſery of ſuch a Law.</p>
            <p>IV. The Perſons ſuppoſed to be criminal by this Law, are ſubjected to an unreaſonable Puniſhment, and this too without any Trial in the Law, in any Form whatever. The ſuppoſed Crime is a Miniſter or licenſed Candidate's preaching in a Pariſh where the Incumbent and major Part of the Church have not invited: <hi>i.e.</hi> If the Incumbent has invited with one Half of the Church and three Quarters of the whole Pariſh, or if the whole Church and Pariſh invite, and not the Incumbent, or if there is not more than Half of the Church, or more than Half of the Society, where there is no Incumbent; each of theſe is ſuch a Crime for which the Puniſhment is, <hi>The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial and Secluſion from the Benefit of any Law of the Colony made for the Support and Encouragement of the Goſpel Miniſtry.</hi> Now I find by looking into your Colony Law-Book, the Laws made for the aforeſaid Purpoſe may be ſum'd up in theſe few Words, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> 
               <q>That all Agreements made by the Inhabitants of a Society or the major Part of them aſſembled in a Society-Meeting, reſpecting the Settlement and Maintenance of the Miniſter they have choſen, ſhall be binding to all the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of ſuch Society, and to their Succeſſors; which Sums or Payments ſo agreed to ſhall be levied and aſſeſſed on the ſeveral Inhabitants in ſuch Society, according to their reſpective Eſtates from Time to Time, as they ſhall be ſet in the general Liſt; which Sums or Payments ſhall be gathered by ſuch Perſon ſaid Society ſhall appoint to be the Collector of them, who is to repa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o an Aſſiſtant or Juſtice of the Peace for a Warrant to enable him to collect the Rate.</q> Now then, as by the preceeding Laws, ſuch Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are made binding to the Inhabitants of a Society and their Succeſſors &amp;c. hence to be denied and ſecluded the Benefit of any Law made for the Support and Encouragement of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Miniſtry, includes in it the being denied and ſecluded the Benefit of holding the Society to ſuch Agreements; and ſo this Law plainly intends, by prohibiting any Aſſiſtant or Juſtice of the Peace, to ſign any Warrant for collecting a Rate where a Miniſter has been certified againſt, as having acted contrary to this Law. So that, in ſhort, the Puniſhment is the Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his Livelihood; and thence forward he may beg his Bread. This appears unreaſonable, to inflict ſo heavy a Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for preaching in ſuch Caſes as abovementioned, when
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:005520_0057_10184D29825824B8"/>
(as it may happen) it might be evidently Duty ſo to do. But let the Preaching be at the Deſire of more or fewer, ſtill it is no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality: it is but an eccleſiaſtical Diſorder, even in the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this Law, which ſurely can't deſerve ſo ſevere a Penalty. Many groſs Immoralities have a much leſs Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aſſigned for them, than this heretofore ſuppoſed innocent Action of preaching the Goſpel. If the civil Peace was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by it, I can't ſee how ſo ſevere a Puniſhment for it can be juſtified. But it is evident, the civil Peace is not broken by this ſuppoſed Crime, which is nothing but preaching the Goſpel; which is ſo far from breaking the Peace, or tending thereto, that it intirely tends to make Men better, and ſo better Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. The preaching out of his own Pariſh does not alter the Nature of the Action, nor is the natural Tendency of the Word changed thereby; no Man's civil Property or Intereſt is at all invaded by it; and how ſuch an Action can be puniſhed at all, appears myſterious to me! It is not for preaching Sedition or Treaſon, but even the Goſpel of Peace, that CHRIST'S Miniſters are render'd liable to be deprived of their daily Bread.</p>
            <p>If it ſhould be here ſaid,—That theſe Laws made for the Support of the Goſpel Miniſtry, are to be looked upon as Acts of <hi>Favour,</hi> relative to ſuch as comply with the eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Conſtitution of the Government; and ſo if any Miniſters will not keep within the Bounds of that Conſtitution, they juſtly forfeit ſuch Favour; and ſo the Puniſhment here is to be underſtood, a Declaration that their Right to ſuch Favour now ceaſes. I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Action, which by this Law is made thus criminal, is not contrary to, but well conſiſtent with the eccleſiaſtical Conſtitution, under which theſe Miniſters are ſuppoſed to ſettle. It is not inconſiſtent with that eccleſiaſtical Conſtitution, for any Miniſter to preach in any other Pariſh than his own to any Number of Chriſtians on their Deſire at any of their private religious Exerciſes.—But I will only Inſtance in one Particular made thus Criminal by this Act, which is warranted by that eccleſiaſtical Conſtitution, and the conſtant Practice of the Churches. The Right Hand of Fellowſhip is given at every Ordination, in which the Miniſters and Churches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, do ſolemnly promiſe to eſteem and treat the Perſon ordained as a duly authorized Miniſter of CHRIST, and to be ready on all Occaſions to own him as ſuch, and to aſſiſt him

in his Work: In Conſequence of theſe ſolemn Promiſes, Miniſters &amp; Churches have looked upon themſelves under ſuch Obligations to each other, that if one of theſe Miniſters judges he has real Need of Aſſiſtance in preaching, from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (where theſe mutual Obligations take Place) he has Right to aſk it, tho' the Church does not join with him in it, and the Church's ſo hearing him preach they have always judged (and therein they have judged truly) is acting but agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to thoſe previous Obligations they have laid themſelves under to him, to treat him as an authorized Miniſter of CHRIST, and to hold Communion with him as ſuch; one Way of doing which, is certainly hearing the Word from him. So that it is plain, one Miniſter's preaching for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon his Deſire, tho' the Church joins not in it, is at leaſt well conſiſtent with the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitution</hi> (and I need ſay no more of it in this Argument) under which theſe Miniſters are ſuppoſed to ſettle, according to the Objection: and therefore no <hi>Forfeiture</hi> is made, by ſuch an Action, of the Benefit of the <hi>Laws</hi> made in Favour of the eccleſiaſtical Conſtitution.—They have Right to this Benefit ſo long (at leaſt) as they act <hi>conſiſtently</hi> with that eccleſiaſtical Conſtitution under which they ſettled.—The <hi>Act,</hi> diſallow'd by this Law, and for which they are deprived of this Benefit, <hi>is conſiſtent</hi> with that Conſtitution.—In this Manner therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> deprive them of it, is to take it away while their Right to it in Equity remains good. This, you ſee, I have ſaid on the Suppoſition, thoſe Laws are to be conſidered only as <hi>Acts of Grace,</hi> as laid in the Objection. But then I ſay in the next Place—</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Laws</hi> here referred to, made for the Support of the <hi>Goſpel Miniſtry,</hi> are <hi>not</hi> Acts of <hi>Grace;</hi> they are no other than what the <hi>Legiſlature</hi> tho't themſelves <hi>obliged</hi> to make. If the civil Authority of a State are obliged to take Care for the Support of Religion, or in other Words, of Schools and the Goſpel Miniſtry, in order to their approving themſelves <hi>nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings Fathers,</hi> (as, I ſuppoſe, every Body will own, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall not ſpend any Time in proving it) then the Law eſpecially referred to is <hi>not an Act of Grace.</hi> It was what the Legiſlature judged moſt juſt, eaſy, and equal for the People, ſafe and eaſy for the Miniſter, who is to give himſelf wholly to his Work; or in a Word, beſt for the People and the Miniſter, that Contracts ſhould be ſo made, ſo binding and ſo performed; for both People and Miniſter are concerned in
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:005520_0059_10184D2E16582378"/>
the Act. I don't ſay, the Legiſlature could not have provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as well in ſome other Way: this is no Ways neceſſary to be ſuppoſed in the Caſe. But as they were obliged to make ſome good Proviſion in the Caſe, both with reſpect to the People who are to pay, and the Miniſter who is to receive, ſo in their Wiſdom they fixed on that Method, as what was good for the whole. 'Tis therefore no more an <hi>Act of Gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e,</hi> than any Act of the Legiſlature reſpecting any <hi>civil</hi> Intereſts or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts of the Subject. What the <hi>public Good</hi> calls for therein, they are <hi>obliged</hi> to do: And the Acts they make in Purſuance thereof are no Acts of <hi>Grace,</hi> but (ſtrictly ſpeaking) of <hi>Debt</hi> to the People. And as the Act, referred to, is not an Act of Grace, ſo this Law brings a <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> not only on the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, as before obſerved, but on the <hi>People</hi> too, by letting them looſe from their <hi>Agreement</hi> with their Miniſter, the now ſuppoſed Offender. For the Miniſter remaining with the People, they have a <hi>new Contract</hi> to make, and muſt take ſome <hi>other Method</hi> for performing it, than what the <hi>Law</hi> in the former Caſe had provided: And from the known <hi>ſtrait-handed</hi> Diſpoſition in too many towards the Support of the Goſpel, it muſt needs follow, that the Burden of the Support of it muſt lie much more <hi>unequally</hi> upon the People, and perhaps on but a very <hi>few.</hi> As this is the certain Conſequence, ſo is it a Certainty, that an <hi>innocent People</hi> are <hi>puniſhed,</hi> with their Miniſter, by this Law.—Beſides, how the letting a People looſe from their ſolemn Agreements with their Miniſter, for an Action never ſuppoſed criminal before this <hi>Law</hi> was made, and is certainly no Violation of the <hi>Contract</hi> he made with them, can conſiſt with Juſtice and Equity, is beyond the Ken of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Underſtandings: which I might have argued from as a diſtinct Head; but it is ſufficient to obſerve it as I paſs, it ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now in my Way.—To return, As the <hi>Puniſhment is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,</hi> ſo is the <hi>Manner of inflicting it extraordinary too,</hi> 
               <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>The Miniſter of the Pariſh where he ſhall ſo offend, or the civil Authority or any two of the Committee of ſuch Pariſh, ſending an Information thereof in Writing under their Hands to the Clerk of the Pariſh where ſuch offending Miniſter does belong,</hi> this does the Buſineſs at once, as appears by the third Paragraph in the Act.—So that meerly from the <hi>Information</hi> of <hi>one</hi> Perſon (as it may be) of a different Perſuaſion in Religion, and inclined from a Party-Spirit to oppreſs, or one that has a perſonal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice againſt a Miniſter, given to the <hi>Clerk of a Pariſh</hi> (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

true or falſe) the Miniſter is deprived of his Livelihood. Thus the Buſineſs is effected without any Formality of a legal Trial, or the Shadow of it. This, as I take it, is directly contrary to the Priviledges of an Engliſhman contained in <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> which has coſt our Predeceſſors Rivers of Blood to defend, and tranſmit down as ſacred to their Deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants. If ſuch a Law as condemns a Man <hi>without hearing him,</hi> deſerves to be expunged the Records of a <hi>free</hi> People (I might ſay, <hi>any;</hi> ſuch a Law being a Scandal to human Nature) I leave you to ſay, what Fate ſuch a Law as this before us deſerves.</p>
            <p>V. I obſerve, by the ſecond Paragraph of this Law, any <hi>Aſſociation of Miniſters</hi> are ſubjected to the before-mentioned Penalty, <q>That ſhall undertake to examine or licenſe any Candidate for the Miniſtry, or aſſume to themſelves the Deciſion of any Controverſy, or to counſel and adviſe in any Affair that by the <hi>Say-Brook</hi> Platform is within the Province and Juriſdiction of any other Aſſociation: Then and in ſuch Caſe <hi>every Member</hi> that ſhall be <hi>preſent</hi> in ſuch Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo licenſing, deciding or counſelling, ſhall be each and every of them denied and ſecluded the Benefit of any Law of this Colony made for the Support and Encouragement of the Goſpel-Miniſtry.</q> Now this is ſubjecting Men to a heavy Puniſhment, for no Crime againſt the civil State, nay for Deeds in themſelves good, and ſuch as may be very ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Intereſts of Religion, as well as what may happen to be otherwiſe; for ſo the Acts of any Aſſociation ſometimes may be, that are allowed of by this Law.</p>
            <p>As they who drew up the Platform, tho't it would be beſt for the <hi>Candidates</hi> of the Miniſtry to be <hi>examined,</hi> ſo they no doubt tho't <hi>every Aſſociation</hi> had Men of Learning and Fidelity to do it: and if it were done by <hi>any</hi> of them, the great <hi>End</hi> propoſed in ſuch Examination would be anſwered. And ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Aſſociation of <hi>New-London</hi> County ſhould examine and licenſe a Candidate, that belonged to the <hi>New-Haven</hi> Aſſociation, may it not be ſuppoſed it would be as well done, and as well anſwer the End, as if done in <hi>New-Haven.</hi> Or if a Pariſh within the Diſtrict of <hi>New-Haven</hi> Aſſociation, deſtitute of a Miniſter, ſhould after they had tried one Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date and another, which they had been adviſed to by the Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, and not ſuited by any of them, aſk Advice of <hi>New-London</hi> Aſſociation, and they adviſe them to one within their

Limits, who they judge well qualified for the Miniſtry, whom upon Trial they judge ſo too, and ſo are well ſuited in a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, what Harm comes of this? or what Iniquity was there in the Act of <hi>New-London</hi> Aſſociation adviſing in that Caſe? How often have Churches found it needful to do ſo, and Religion been ſerved by it? How often have they gone out of the Colony for ſuch Advice, and the Miniſters of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> adviſed Churches in <hi>Connecticut</hi> in ſuch a Caſe, on their Application for it; and ſo on the contrary, Miniſters in <hi>Connecticut,</hi> adviſed Churches in the <hi>Maſſachuſetts?</hi> Where lies the Difference! or was this always criminal in its own Nature! or if not, why ſhould a whole Aſſociation of Miniſters, for doing what I have above inſtanced in, be ſtripped of their Livings, as it ſeems by this Law they muſt! And what is more extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſtill, <hi>a Miniſter's meerly being</hi> preſent <hi>when it is done, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders him liable to this Puniſhment,</hi> whether he has any Hand in it or no; nay, for ought appears, if he ſhould proteſt againſt it, yet he eſcapes no Part of the Penalty. The Crime, it ſeems, is of ſuch a Nature, that if a Man be in the ſame Room, tho' he proteſts againſt the Action, he is ſtill equally faulty with the Actors: for ſince he is equally puniſhed, he muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed equally faulty.

               </gap> of Men the Glory of ſuch a rare Invention.—But to finiſh on this Head;—Nothing is more evident, than that ſuch an Examination or Advice, now inſtanced in, does not touch the civil Peace; and certainly therefore, the civil Authority go out of their Line to make this penal Law. And how near this comes to <hi>turning Judgment into Wormwood,</hi> may deſerve the ſerious Conſideration of ſome.</p>
            <p>VI. The fourth Paragraph reſpects a licenſed Candidate's or any Layman's <hi>publickly preaching and exhorting in any Pariſh, not deſired</hi> in ſuch Manner as expreſſed in the firſt Paragraph. On which I ſhall but briefly obſerve, that the Words expreſſive of the Offence, are of ſo looſe or general Signification, as that a Perſon merely for religious Diſcourſe, or the moſt ſavoury Advice, ſeaſonably and prudently given at any private reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Meeting of Chriſtians, is liable to be treated as an Offender; and if I have not been miſinformed, there have been Inſtances of this: However that be, there is Danger of it. Or if a Man going into any publick Houſe, ſhould hear a Company talking profanely and wickedly, and thereupon ſeriouſly lay open their Sin, and gravely adviſe them thereupon,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:005520_0062_10184D36419CE720"/>
he would be liable to be treated as an Offender; and as the Hands may be, into which he might happen to fall, he would not eſcape it. But further, if it be ſuppoſed ſuch Preaching and Exhorting there referred to, be a <hi>Diſorder</hi> ſometimes, yet it is not <hi>always</hi> ſo: but whenever it is ſo (unleſs you ſuppoſe it done to the <hi>Interruption</hi> of ſome <hi>lawful Aſſembly</hi>) it is no Breach of the Peace, and comes not under <hi>civil</hi> Cognizance. Such diſorderly Perſons ought to be proceeded againſt in an <hi>eccleſiaſtical</hi> Manner, agreable to the Laws of CHRIST.</p>
            <p>VII. I come now to the laſt Paragraph, which runs thus: <q>That if any <hi>Foreigner</hi> or <hi>Stranger</hi> that is not an Inhabitant within this Colony, including as well ſuch Perſons, that have no eccleſiaſtical Character, or Licenſe to preach, as ſuch as have received Ordination or Licenſe to preach by any Aſſociation or Preſbytery, ſhall preſume to preach, teach or publickly to exhort in any Town or Society within this Colony, without the Deſire and Licenſe of the ſettled Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter and the major Part of the Church of ſuch Town or Society; or at the Call and Deſire of the Church and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of ſuch Town or Society, provided that it ſo happen that there is no ſettled Miniſter there; that every ſuch Teacher or Exhorter ſhall be ſent (as a <hi>vagrant</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) by Warrant from any one Aſſiſtant or Juſtice of the Peace from Conſtable to Conſtable, out of the Bounds of this Colony</q>.

Or could it <hi>diſquiet</hi> and <hi>diſturb</hi> any Minds except ſuch as can't bear their Chriſtian Neighbours ſhould enjoy their unalienable Rights!—But to return to the before mentioned laſt Paragraph, I obſerve, that <hi>any Stranger, not an Inhabitant in the Colony, who has received Ordination or Licenſe to preach from any</hi> ASSOCIATION <hi>or</hi> PRESBYTERY, <hi>that ſhall preſume to preach undeſired,</hi> as expreſſed in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, is liable to be treated as a <hi>Vagrant,</hi> unworthy to tread on that Spot of Earth: But if he ſhould happen to be licenſed by the Patriarch of <hi>Greece,</hi> a Super-intendant of <hi>Denmark,</hi> or any Biſhop, he may eſcape the Laſh of this Law. If the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of a Stranger and preaching in ſuch a Manner be ſuch a Breach of the Peace, as is puniſhable by the State, why ſhould there be ſuch <hi>Partiality?</hi> Why ſhould Dr. <hi>Watts'</hi>s preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſuch Manner in <hi>Connecticut</hi> be a greater Crime, becauſe ordained by a <hi>Preſbytery,</hi> than any other Stranger's doing ſo that was licenſed by a Patriarch or Biſhop, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—However, that is much leſs to be wondered at, than ſuch Treatment as this Law ſubjects orthodox Miniſters to, even the beſt Miniſters of Chriſt upon Earth, for a mere Non-conformity to a certain Point of Order, that never took Place (I ſuppoſe) in any Church upon Earth.</p>

I don't men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this becauſe I would go into the Conſideration of what particular Powers may be in your <hi>Charter,</hi> different from others; tho' I confeſs, I can't find any Words in your <hi>Charter,</hi> that expreſs or imply a Power to do any Thing that is pretended to be done by this Law, to eſtabliſh or regulate by Law any Matters of an eccleſiaſtical Nature, to impoſe any civil Pains or Penalties in Matters of Conſcience, relating to the Worſhip of God. But neither your Colony, nor any other in the King's Dominions, have any rightful Authority to do as is here ſuppoſed, according to the Queſtion, as I have truly ſtated it. Let me here take a plain Caſe to illuſtrate the Point. <hi>Wickliff</hi> aroſe a Light in <hi>England,</hi> while Popery prevailed: be it ſuppoſed, he inſtructed a few in the Truth, but neither Biſhop nor Incumbent of the Pariſh would give Leave for his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. However, he goes on preaching the Goſpel, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will hear him. In this Caſe, the King and Parliament had no rightful Authority to baniſh <hi>Wickliff,</hi> or turn him out from the Iſland, for his ſo preaching. For, as has been already ſhewn in the preceeding Pages, <hi>the End of civil Government being the
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:005520_0065_101812EEA2ECF6B8"/>
Preſervation of Perſon and Property, it would be a plain departing from the End of civil Government, to inflict any Puniſhment on</hi> Wickliff <hi>for his ſo preaching.</hi> What the civil Authority is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to defend and ſecure, is not hurt at all by the ſuppoſed Action of <hi>Wickliff;</hi> and it is really acting againſt the Deſign of the civil Magiſtrate's Truſt, to hurt an innocent Subject.—Beſides, the Right of private Judgment in Matters of Religion being unalienable, and what the civil Magiſtrate is rather oblig'd to protect his Subjects equally in, both <hi>Wickliff,</hi> and they who deſired to hear him, had a juſt Right to remain where they were, in the Enjoyment of that Right, free from all Moleſtation from any Perſons whatſoever; agreeable to what has been ſufficiently evidenced in the foregoing Pages.—On the other Hand, ſee the <hi>Abſurdity</hi> of ſuppoſing that the civil Magiſtrate had rightful Authority to have ſent away <hi>Wickliff.</hi> If the Magiſtrate had Right to ſend him away becauſe the <hi>ſtanding Clergy</hi> were unwilling he ſhould preach (that being one of the Caſes ſuppoſed in this Law) then the civil Authority muſt have had equal Right to ſend any <hi>other</hi> ſuch Perſon away, as faſt as they appeared; and conſequently they muſt be ſuppoſed to have had rightful Authority to hold their Subjects in the worſt <hi>Slavery,</hi> i.e. to keep them from the Exerciſe of their <hi>private Judgment</hi> in Matters of <hi>Religion;</hi> a Power to do which never was nor could be veſted in the civil Magiſtrate, by the People, by any original Compact, which is truly ſuppoſed the Foundation of all civil Government. It alters not the Nature of civil Government, whether the Magiſtrate be Proteſtant or Papiſt, Chriſtian or Pagan. What of Right ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains to the civil Magiſtrate by Virtue of his <hi>Office,</hi> muſt alſo neceſſarily belong to him, tho' Popiſh, or Heathen. The Suppoſal therefore that the civil Magiſtrate in <hi>England</hi> at that Day had rightful Authority to have ſent away <hi>Wickliff,</hi> for preaching the Goſpel without Leave of the Clergy, is big with too great an Abſurdity, for a conſiſtent Proteſtant to ſwallow. Suppoſe then theſe <hi>Colonies</hi> to have exiſted at that Time, or <hi>Great Britain</hi> and theſe Colonies <hi>Popiſh</hi> now, as <hi>Great-Britain</hi> was then, and <hi>Wickliff</hi> to come into any of them and preach in ſome Pariſh without the Conſent of the Incumbent, at the Deſire of a Number of People, it is certain, in this Caſe none of theſe Colonies could have any rightful Authority to thruſt him out of their Borders, or do any Thing like it.—The <hi>ſame Reaſons</hi> muſt conclude againſt theſe Colonies Authority to
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:005520_0066_10184D41AAB72670"/>
tranſport him, for coming and preaching <hi>now</hi> without an Incumbent's Leave at the Deſire of a Number, as in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Caſe; the ſame Principles and Reaſoning will hold equally true, applied to any ſuch Inſtance as now before us, any Time ſince the Reformation from Popery. The civil <hi>Peace</hi> is no Ways broken by this Action of <hi>preaching,</hi> of which we are ſpeaking: But indeed if any ſhould take Occaſion from it, to contend and quarrel with their Neighbours, as Papiſts and Heathens have ſometimes done, the Apoſtle (<hi>James</hi> 4.1.) has ſhown us the true Spring thereof, the <hi>Luſts</hi> in Men's Hearts; the Outbreakings of which in <hi>Injuries</hi> to their Neighbours, fall under the civil Magiſtrate's Cognizance.—And the Rights of <hi>Conſcience and private Judgment</hi> in Matters of <hi>Religion</hi> are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterably the ſame: And 'tis a Scandal to Chriſtians, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and quarrel with their Neighbours for enjoying them, and inexcuſable in a Proteſtant State to make any Infringement upon them. And it was on theſe very Principles, which I here Advance (and by which this Law muſt fall) that our firſt <hi>Reformers</hi> acted, and on which all Reformations muſt be built. And tho' our Nation in Times paſt under the Influence of a bigotted Clergy, and arbitrary weak or popiſh Princes, have made Laws founded on Principles contrary to theſe I have been pleading for; yet they ſeem in a great Meaſure rooted out of the Nation: and theſe Principles of Truth have taken Root, and been growing ever ſince the happy <hi>Revolution,</hi> and Act of <hi>Toleration;</hi> and 'tis to be hoped, will prevail &amp; ſpread more and more, until all ſpiritual Tyranny, and lording it over the Conſciences of Men, be baniſhed out of the World.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall finiſh with obſerving, That by Virtue of the <hi>Act of Toleration,</hi> all his Majeſty's Subjects are ſo freed from the Force of all <hi>Coercive Laws</hi> in Matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> relating to Worſhip and Diſcipline, that they act their own <hi>private Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> without Reſtraint:—That <hi>any Number</hi> of Chriſtians, greater or leſs, hear <hi>any Proteſtant Miniſter</hi> they deſire, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Controul from the Will of others, or Authority of the civil State:—Since this is the Caſe, and withal as plain as the Sun in the Meridian, that where ſuch a <hi>Law</hi> as this I have been conſidering, takes Place, <hi>There</hi> People are abridged of that <hi>Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> which the ſame Perſons would enjoy under the preſent Conſtitution, if they were in <hi>England.</hi> And how far therefore it falls ſhort of denying and ſecluding them from

the Benefit of the <hi>Act of Toleration,</hi> I leave you to ſay, who well know, that it is expreſly provided by the Terms of your <hi>Charter,</hi> that <hi>the Laws to be made in Virtue of it, ſhall not be contrary to the Laws of</hi> England. This Right of private Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Liberty now mentioned, is confeſſed and ſecured to you by that Law which was the Glory of the Reign of WIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIAM and MARY; but by your Law now before me, it is denied to you. How you will clear it from a <hi>Contrariety</hi> to the former, I know not. Nor is this about a trivial Matter, or what is dependent upon the Will of your Legiſlature. The Rights of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> depend not on the Will of the Prince, or the Will of the Legiſlature; but they are the inherent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Rights of <hi>Engliſhmen:</hi> ſecured and confirmed they may be by the Legiſlature, but not derived from nor dependent on their <hi>Will.</hi> And if there be any Rights, any Priviledges, that we may call natural and unalienable, this is one, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> the Right of <hi>private Judgment,</hi> and Liberty of worſhipping God accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Conſciences, without controul from human Laws. A Priviledge more valuable than the civil Rights of <hi>Magna Charta.</hi>—This we hold, not from <hi>Man,</hi> but from GOD: which therefore no Man can touch and be innocent. And all the Invaders of it will certainly find, when they ſhall ſtand at his Bar, from whom we hold this, <hi>that</hi> CHRIST <hi>will be King in his own Kingdom.</hi>—In the mean Time, it ſtands Chriſtians in Hand to hold faſt this Priviledge, and to be on their Guard againſt all Attempts made upon it. And I doubt not, thoſe Miniſters who were apprehenſive of this, and freely addreſſed the Legiſlative Body of <hi>Connecticut</hi> (as I hear was done <hi>October</hi> 1742.) for a Repeal of this Law, did therein what was pleaſing to their great Lord &amp; Maſter which is in Heaven. They acted becoming ſuch as durſt not themſelves, and were willing to do what lay in their Power that others might not, <hi>Lord it over God's Heritage.</hi> Not that I would inſinuate, that there were no others <hi>like-minded</hi> with them—but that therein they ſet an excellent Example for others to copy after, and what was proper to awaken the Attention of Chriſtians. It has commonly been the Caſe, that Chriſtian <hi>Liberty,</hi> as well as Civil, has been loſt by little and little; and Experience has taught, that it is not eaſy to recover it, when once loſt. So precious a <hi>Jewel</hi> is always to be watched with a careful Eye: for no People are likely to enjoy Liberty long, that are not zealous to preſerve it.—As a real Friend to it, I have given

you my Thoughts with Freedom and Plainneſs, as you deſired. If they prove ſatisfying to you, and you judge that they may be any Ways ſerviceable to the Cauſe of Truth and Chriſtian Liberty, you may uſe them for that Purpoſe as you ſhall think beſt.</p>
