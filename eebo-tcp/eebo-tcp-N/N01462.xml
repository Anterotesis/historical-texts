            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>And he lift up his Eyes and ſaw the Women and the Children, and ſaid, Who are theſe with thee? And he ſaid, The Children which God hath gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly given thy Servant.</hi>

            <p>IN the beginning of this <hi>Chapter</hi> we have the Account of the <hi>Brotherly</hi> Affectionate Meeting of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau.</hi> It was a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Proof of Gods <hi>Empire</hi> over the hearts of Men, and of His gracious <hi>Care</hi> of good Men and anfwering their Prayers. <hi>Jacob</hi> had been <hi>Wreſtling</hi> in Prayer for this favour of Providence. His fears of his <hi>Brothers</hi> reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments had been very Great. In his great Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Wiſdom he had taken the moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meaſures to <hi>Soften</hi> his Brothers heart towards him. He ſent his <hi>Preſents</hi> before him, and now put his <hi>Wives</hi> and their <hi>Children</hi> into the moſt Moving Order that could be, and himſelf as the
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001737_0005_0FB776CA75B6F230"/>head of them. <hi>Seven times</hi> he bowed himſelf to the Ground before his <hi>Brother;</hi> He did O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyſance to him as his <hi>Elder</hi> Brother, and his Temporal <hi>Lord;</hi> He remembred alſo its very likely the <hi>Injury and Provocation</hi> he had on his part given tho' the thing was of God. This <hi>Humility</hi> and Reſpect of <hi>Jacob</hi> turn'd <hi>Eſau</hi>'s heart within him, or rather <hi>GOD chang'd</hi> it in that Inſtant; and <hi>Eſan ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his Neck and kiſſed him, and they both wept.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Natural Affection</hi> which had been ſo long <hi>Suppreſs'd,</hi> now returned in the <hi>Full Tyde</hi> thereof. How <hi>good is it</hi> to ſee <hi>Brethren</hi> that have been at Enmity ſo reconciled! <hi>A Brother offended is hard to be won.</hi> He that offends is hardly bro't to ſubmit like <hi>Jacob.</hi> When God touches a Mans heart his Enmity to his Brother vaniſhes. When ſhall we ſee Brethren at diſtance meet again like theſe in our <hi>Context,</hi> and Emulate — I will not ſay the temper of Profane <hi>Eſau,</hi> — that would be a reproach — but the humility and affection of good <hi>Jacob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THEY meet and ſay not a Word of their old differences: <hi>that</hi> would have ſoon broke the Peace again; had <hi>Eſau</hi> remembred how <hi>Jacob</hi> had <hi>Supplanted</hi> him with a Lye, or <hi>Jacob</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated <hi>Eſau</hi>'s threaning to <hi>Murder</hi> him. <q>'Tis the <hi>Repeating</hi> a Matter that Separates Friends, and Perpetuates their Separation. A ſubmiſſive Carriage will go a great way to conquer a very <hi>Eſau</hi> and turn away Wrath. The Bullet flies over him that ſtoops:</q> Sayes Mr. <hi>Henry.</hi>

               <hi>I'M afraid,</hi> tho' Charity obliges us to think the beſt; yet I'm <hi>afraid</hi> that <hi>Eſan</hi>'s <hi>carnal tho'ts</hi> of the Birthright and of the Bleſſing helpt to preſerve <hi>Jacob.</hi> He was born the <hi>Prince</hi> of the Family, and ſaw now <hi>that Birthright</hi> ſecure; <hi>Jacob</hi> with his Children lying at his Feet. This might help to make him <hi>Eaſie.</hi> His <hi>Arming</hi> and Conteſt might be for a <hi>Temporal Dominion;</hi> that's the <hi>Bleſſing</hi> that moſt People deſire. The Caſe was the ſame as that in the beginning between <hi>Cain &amp; Abel;</hi>
               <q>and God told <hi>Cain</hi> that <hi>Abels</hi> Preference in the Divine Acceptance did no ways releaſe him from the Duty and Reſpect which was owing from him as a <hi>Younger Brother: To thee ſhall be his deſire, and thou ſhalt reign over him.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>Jacob</hi> underſtood this well, and accordingly he did in Duty and Loyalty ſubmit to <hi>my Lord Eſau.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT the thing was of <hi>God,</hi> who turns Mens Hearts by a Secret, Silent, Reſiſtleſs Power, as He pleaſes. The <hi>Brethren both wept:</hi> how plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant are the <hi>Tears of Joy</hi> after thoſe of <hi>Anger, Grief and Fear?</hi> The Diſcord of Brethren oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion the <hi>One,</hi> their Reconciliation the <hi>Other.</hi>

               <p n="1">[I.] That a Mother with a Train of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren after her is One of the moſt admirable and lovely Sights in the Viſible Creation of God. <hi>And Eſau lift up his Eyes and ſaw the Women and the Children, and ſaid who are theſe with thee.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="3">[III.] Under the Outward Smiles of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on us and our Families, it well becomes us to be the more Humble, Meek and Lowly before God and Man. They are the Family which God has <hi>Graciouſly</hi> given <hi>thy Servant.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>A very <hi>Superious</hi> Part of it in <hi>our Eyes</hi> to be ſure, if we at all honour <hi>Our Selves.</hi> But becauſe we may be <hi>Partial</hi> to our Selves, let us judge only by the Honour that God has put upon us.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001737_0009_0FB776E9FA811CA0"/>The Earth and all the Creatures in it were made for the Comfort, Service and Dominion of Man: Gen. 1.26. <hi>And God ſaid, let us make Man in our Image, after our likeneſs, and let him have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>So God Created Man in his own I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, in the Image of God created He him, Male and Female created He them: And God bleſſed them, and God ſaid unto them, be fruitful and multiply and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh the Earth and ſubdue it.</hi> It was the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Man, and in Token of his Dignity and Pre-eminence above the other Creatures, that he was made <hi>Laſt;</hi> for the Method of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation was to advance from that which was leaſt perfect to that which is more ſo; and thus Man the Lord of the lower World and the Image of the <hi>Creator</hi> in it was made the <hi>Crown</hi> of it; and as the Top-ſtone in the Noble Structure was bro't in with ſhouting; Grace, Grace unto it. The Flights of <hi>Birds</hi> in the Air are a fine and curious Spectacle, when they ſometimes cloud and cover the Skies from our Eye: The Shoals of <hi>Fiſh</hi> in the Sea are a very admirable Sight, when now and then a few only of thoſe Innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Inhabitants of the Waters ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Eyes of Men.

                     <q>Angels were not made Male and Female, for they were not to Propagate their Kind. In the next World we ſhall be as the Angels which <hi>neither Marry,</hi> &amp;c.</q> But Man an Earthly Creature, an <hi>Imbodied Angel,</hi> was
<q>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Male and Female that their Nature may be Propagated and the Race continued.

                  <p>WHEN GOD had Created our <hi>Firſt Parents,</hi> and Look'd upon them with Love and Pleaſure then He Bleſſed them, with the Promiſe of a Numerous and Long Poſterity. <hi>Be Fruitful and Multiply.</hi> This was the Honour of our firſt Mother <hi>Eve,</hi> that She was <hi>the Mother of all Living,</hi> Gen. 3.20.

NOW the USE of this firſt <hi>Meditation</hi> might have been,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>TO Congratulate ſome of You whom God has bleſſed with very Amiable and Lovely Conſorts, and a Numerous hopeful Family of Children.

2.

                  <p n="3">3. LET me add a <hi>Caution to the Barren; Not to be dejected for want of Children;</hi> as <hi>Rachel</hi> and poor <hi>Hannah</hi> were too much. For tho' it be ſuch a favour to be the Mother of many, yet there are Greater favours than this to ſet our Hearts upon; and it may be you in your <hi>Eſpouſals to Christ</hi> have much more to ſatisfie your Soul in; or at leaſt <hi>thither</hi> let me direct you. Or indeed even our preſent Life <hi>Conſiſts not</hi> in a Numerous Poſterity; that we ſhould ſay Sinfully and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly fooliſhly with <hi>Rachel, Give we Children or I dye.</hi> No; you may with <hi>Hannah</hi> Pray; but you muſt be Content if you are even denied; which <hi>She</hi> was not.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>THOSE of us that have but a Single Branch or Two,</hi> an <hi>only One</hi> (it may be) the <hi>Siender Hope</hi> and Prop of our Houſe, muſt be very <hi>Thankful</hi> to God for the ſingle <hi>Lamp</hi> in our Houſe. If <hi>We</hi> were meet for more; as meet as our better Nei'bours, God would have given us more, it may be. Let humility preſerve us, and let us be thankful for the leaſt, when we <hi>deſerve Nothing.</hi>

I. <hi>THEY are among the Choice Favours and Gifts of Providence to a Perſon.</hi> Let <hi>Nature</hi> decide this; Or if <hi>that</hi> in its preſent Affections and Judgment is apt to err, let the <hi>Scripture</hi> determine it: Pſal. 127.3. <hi>Lo, Children are an Heritage, and the fruit of the Womb is his Reward.</hi> They are their Parents beſt Inheritance, and the Gift of Free Grace. Pſal. 113.9. <hi>He maketh the barren Woman to keep houſe, and to be a joyful Mother of Children; praiſe ye the Lord.</hi> Pſal. 107.41. <hi>He ſetteth the Poor on High from Affliction, and maketh him Families like a Flock.</hi> To be ſure if <hi>Providence</hi> concerns it<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelf in any thing here below, it is in the Matters of our <hi>Life and Death; Who, How many</hi> ſhall be born into the World, and <hi>Where</hi> and by <hi>Whom,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>YET Children are by no Means to be put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong or equal'd to the <hi>Saving Gifts</hi> of Gods Grace. There is a better Name than of Sons and Dau'ters. A Numerous Poſterity is the Portion of many a <hi>Wicked Perſon.</hi> Pſal. 17.14, 15. <hi>They are full of Children, and leave their Subſtance to their Babes; as for me I will behold thy face in Righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. Nevertheleſs Children are a very Gracious <hi>Gift</hi> of God to us in this Life. They are ſo,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>IN the Formation of them in the Womb.</hi> For who knoweth the way of the Spirit, or how the bones do grow within Her that is with Child? It is not at all owing to the Parents care that there is a perfect Child formed, and quickened by a Living Soul. God that formed Adams Body out of the Ground, forms our Bodies in

But could Pious <hi>Hannah or Ruth</hi> receive their Sons without their Solemn Offerings of Praiſes to God? No: Ruth 4.14. <hi>And the Women ſaid unto Naomi, Bleſſed be the Lord which has not left thee this day without a Name in Iſrael: and Naomi took the Child and laid it in her Boſom.</hi> Read alſo <hi>Hannah:</hi> tranſport of Devotion at the Dedication of her <hi>Little Nazarite,</hi> and Her <hi>Song:</hi> 1 Sam. 2. Chap.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. IF Children are Gods Gift to us, <hi>Then they ſhould be given to God again:</hi> Dedicated to Him as His Propriety and Reſigned to His diſpoſal; to be bro't up for Him, and to Live to Him and Serve Him for ever. So <hi>Abraham</hi> Circumcis'd his <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Hannah</hi> devoted her <hi>Samuel,</hi> and we in <hi>Baptiſm Conſecrate our Children unto CHRIST.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>CHILDREN ſhould remember themſelves to be the LORD's, and their Bonds to Live to Him.</hi> God gave thee thy Being and thy Life; and gave thee to thy Parents who have given thee back to Him again. Be <hi>His,</hi> My <hi>Child;</hi> and ſo Gods gracious Gift to <hi>Us,</hi> and <hi>Ours</hi> and thine <hi>Own</hi> to Him again.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. IF Children are the gracious Gift of God, then it is <hi>Lawful and a Duty to Mourn under the Holy and Awful hand of God in their Death; or in their Sinful Courſes</hi> which may be worſe than Death. Sorrow is Natural, and may be Gracious in ſuch Caſes; but it muſt be in Moderation
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001737_0016_0FB7770B671347D8"/>and with Reſignation. Even <hi>Jacob</hi> himſelf was an Intemperate Mourner for <hi>Joſeph;</hi> and bitter was his Grief and deep his Shame when ſome others of his <hi>Sons</hi> ſtain'd their hands with blood, ſhed treacherouſly and cuelly. Our <hi>Dead</hi> Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows are often very heavy ones; like the ſhrieks at <hi>Rama, Rachel</hi> Mourning for her Children, not to be Comforted. But our <hi>Living</hi> Sorrows may be <hi>heavier</hi> far, as well as more <hi>Laſting:</hi> Prov. 10.1. <hi>A wiſe Son maketh a glad Father, but a fooliſh Son is the heavineſs of his Mother.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THIS is the <hi>Firſt Thing</hi> under the <hi>Second Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation;</hi> That Children are among the Special Favours and Gifts of Providence.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>WE ought to have a high Senſe of the Grace of God expreſſed towards us in the hopeful Children which He gives us.</hi> They are <hi>Graciouſly</hi> given to us. The Gift of free Grace; without and againſt our deſerts.</p>
                  <p>THEY are a Viſible and Senſible Expreſſion of the Divine Favour to us. So we read, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.5. That <hi>Obed-Edom had Eight Sons, for God bleſſed him.</hi> Many Children are the Divine Bleſſing on a Family.</p>
                  <p>THEY are a great <hi>Pleaſure and Delight</hi> to Parents: an <hi>Honour and Reputation</hi> alſo among Men; and a Safe-guard and <hi>Protection</hi> to us as they grow up.

                  </p>
                  <p>CHILDREN are more than <hi>Riches:</hi> they are the <hi>Heirs</hi> of it: and which is, Greater, the Earth or its <hi>Owners?</hi> Moreover, we may and ought to hope well concerning our Children with reſpect to the <hi>Spiritual and Everlaſting Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the Life to come.</hi> As <hi>Jacob</hi> here look'd upon <hi>his Children</hi> as Graciouſly given him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were <hi>Heirs of the Covenant Bleſſing;</hi> they were to build up the Church of God, and be the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> the Fathers of the People of God.

                  <p>IN a Word; the <hi>least Token</hi> of Gods favour is <hi>free Grace</hi> to a Sinful Creature.

It is of Gods Free, and Rich, and Sovereign Grace that He does not <hi>call our Sins to Remembrance</hi> ſo as to <hi>Slay our "Children.</hi> When God <hi>Removes</hi> our Comforts He <hi>Remembers</hi> our Sins; while He continues them to us He graciouſly <hi>Overlooks</hi> our Sinfulneſs: <hi>i. e.</hi> This is the Face and Language of His Providence:</p>

TO <hi>Improve this Head</hi> a little.</p>

                  <p>Yet,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>BEWARE of Inordinate Love.</hi> Do not give them thy heart.

                  <head>III. Obſer. <hi>THAT under the Outward Smiles of Providence on us and our Families, it well becomes us to be the more Humble, Meek and Lowly before God and Man.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THEY are the Children which God has given <hi>thy Servant.</hi> It may be <hi>Eſau</hi> had not then ſo fair a <hi>Troop</hi> to ſhow; yet <hi>they with their Father were Eſau's humble Servants.</hi> Together they were ready to <hi>Proſtrate</hi> and lye at his feet. <hi>Humility</hi> is a lovely Grace and Vertue in the ſight of God and Man. It charms down Pride and Wrath together. And its beauty is Greateſt under the Smiles of Providence. It is the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of the Soul</hi> that is of Great price in Gods Eyes, and as it exalts the Soul in His Sight, ſo it procures Exaltation in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom both of Providence and Grace. <hi>He that humbleth himſelf ſhall be Exalted. He giveth Grace to the lowly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>BE ye clothed with Humility:</hi> ſayes the <hi>Apostle,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.5. This is our <hi>glorious but decent</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray whether we be in Proſperity or Adverſity-Without it the <hi>Nakedneſs</hi> of the Soul is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and its <hi>Shame</hi> is ſeen.</p>
                  <p>WHAT is there on Earth, I beſeech you, to be <hi>Vain or Proud of?</hi> What in a corrupt and dying <hi>World!</hi> Or if we ſo vainly abuſe any Enjoyment, and fall into the Condemnation of the Devil, how ſadly do we forfeit it?</p>

SOME under the viſible favours of Providence grow vain and hau'ty, and forget their <hi>Riſe,</hi> that they are like others <hi>of the duſt,</hi> and turning apace to it again, that they or their Fathers were <hi>Poor and low once</hi> in outward State, and in this uncertain World may ſuddenly <hi>be ſo again:</hi> The Upſtart and Mean Spirit is ready to forget the Rock whence he was hewn, and to ſcorn and upbraid the Poor, the Needy and the Afflicted. But not ſo Good <hi>Jacob,</hi> who looking over his Servants and his Flocks, and his Children cried out; <hi>O God of my Fathers, I am not worthy of the leaſt of all the Mercies, and of all the Truth, which thou haſt ſhewed unto thy Servant; for with my Staff I paſſed over this Jordan, and now I am become two Bands. Job</hi> alſo in his Proſperity and in the Months when God preſerv'd him; when the Candle of the Lord ſhined on his Head and by His light he walked thro' darkneſs; while his <hi>Children were about him,</hi> and he waſhed his ſteps in butter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Even then he did <hi>not deſpiſe the Canſe of his Servant,</hi> but remembred; — <hi>He that made Him in the Womb made me, and One God faſhioned us both.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O 'tis a little and <hi>Mean Vice,</hi> but of <hi>Great Guilt,</hi> to ſwell upon a few Worldly Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, and bear our ſelves above Others on that Account; the <hi>King of Iſrael</hi> remembred humbly his <hi>Original</hi> and ſaid before God, <hi>Lord who am I and what is my Fathers houſe that thou hast bro't me hitherto! and that thou ſhouldeſt ſpeak of the Houſe of thy Servant for a great while to come!</hi>

WHEN <hi>Jacob</hi> Pointed to his Children, and Spake of them to <hi>Eſau</hi> with ſo much <hi>Humility;</hi> think not that he <hi>Complemented</hi> his Brother, in calling himſelf <hi>His Servant:</hi> No, that <hi>Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Age</hi> was full of <hi>Simplicity</hi> as well as <hi>Courteſie:</hi> He ſpake the Words of <hi>Truth and Soberneſs;</hi> his <hi>Heart</hi> went with his <hi>Lips;</hi> He Spake as he <hi>tho't</hi> and as <hi>he felt;</hi> the Inward Senſe of his Soul; and as became an <hi>Inferior</hi> in Outward <hi>State,</hi> and Natural <hi>Relation.</hi> He was ready and inclined to <hi>Serve</hi> him. His <hi>Fears</hi> were Great, but he had the <hi>real Love of a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and the <hi>Reſpect of a Junior.</hi> And juſt now he was eſpecially <hi>Oblig'd by Eſau's Kindneſs,</hi> and full of <hi>Gratitude</hi> both to GOD and Him.</p>
                  <p>TO <hi>Conclude,</hi> We ſhould <hi>leaſt of all be Proud of our Children,</hi> becauſe our <hi>Saviour</hi> has made a <hi>Little Child the Emblem of Humility</hi> to us. Mat. 18.2, 3. <hi>He took a little Child and ſet in the midſt of his Diſciples, and ſaid to them, Whoſoever ſhall humble himſelf as this Little Child, the ſame is Greateſt in the Kingdom of God: And except ye be Converted and become as Little Children ye add in no wiſe enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> It ſeems then that <hi>Converting Grace</hi> make us as <hi>Little Children.</hi> As One ſayes,
<q>Not <hi>Fooliſh</hi> as Children, nor <hi>Fickle,</hi> nor

                        <hi>Playful;</hi> but as Children ready to <hi>Learn,</hi> and deſirous of the <hi>Sincere Milk of the Word;</hi> as Children <hi>Careful for Nothing</hi> but <hi>Depending</hi> on the Care of our Heavenly Father; As Children <hi>Harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs</hi>

As they are <hi>Little in Body and Low in Stature;</hi> ſo Chriſtians ſhould be <hi>Low in Spirit and Little in their own Tho'ts.</hi>
                     </q> It would therefore be a moſt <hi>abſurd</hi> thing for us to be Proud of our Children, when Chriſt has made them the ſign of <hi>Humility</hi> to us. We are to look on them and learn <hi>Humility.</hi>

                  <p>HAPPY the Man that can Say and Sing <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalm and Profeſſion of Humility, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 131.</p>
                  <p>UNDER the <hi>Favours</hi> of Providence our <hi>Heart ſhould not be hau'ty nor our Eyes loftly;</hi> we muſt neither court our own Shadow, nor envy nor deſpiſe Others; And under the <hi>Frowns of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, Surely we muſt behave, and quiet our ſelves as a weaned Child.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>THE Child at the Age of <hi>Weaning</hi> is not come to the <hi>Acting of Pride;</hi> or the Child may <hi>take on at firſt</hi> when it is Weaned from the Breaſt; but when <hi>Once weaned it grows quiet.</hi>
                     </q> So Sanctifying Grace weans us from Worldly things, and <hi>Quiets</hi> us in the <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> or in the <hi>Loſs</hi> of them. We muſt Learn to
<q>Live upon God and the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> when Creatures prove <hi>Dry Breaſts</hi> to us; or when Providence <hi>puts Wormwood</hi> on the Breaſt to Wean us from it.</q>
