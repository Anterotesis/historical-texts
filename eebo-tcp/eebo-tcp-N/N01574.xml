            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <hi>DOCTRINE, I.</hi> That the Soul of Man is a noble Palace, which GOD has built for Himſelf.</head>
                     <p>This is the Palace which the <hi>Text</hi> ſpeaks of; even Mans Soul, and tho' it is not here ſpoken of as the Palace of God, but much the contrary; yet from the beginning and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally it was His only. Every houſe has ſome Builder, but <hi>He that built all things in God:</hi> and for whom did He or could He make any thing, and every thing, but for <hi>Himſelf: for his pleaſure they are and were Created.</hi> But above other things God made his Rational and Intelligent Creatures for his own poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, uſe and propriety. This is common to <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Men;</hi> Heaven is His Throne, and the Earth His Footſtool; but Angels the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Heaven, and Men the People of His Paſture Earth, were His own deſigned Habitation and Reſidence. He made both one and other in His own <hi>Image,</hi> in His like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The Realms above He prepared for Angels; this Earth a <hi>Paradiſe</hi> for Man, whom He placed an <hi>Imbodied Angel</hi> upon it, a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Mind clothed in fleſh, crowned with
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001872_0009_0FB9722BE8A4F3F8"/>glory and honour; and he walked with God, God viſited him daily and converſed with him, yea dwelt in him. This was Mans <hi>First State;</hi> He was the Reſidence and <hi>Manſion of the Creator</hi> here upon Earth.</p>
                     <p>For what is a <hi>Palace?</hi> but ſome Dwelling of a <hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>King,</hi> which he builds for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for the <hi>Honour of his Majeſty,</hi> and to ſhew <hi>the Riches of his Kingdom.</hi> He builds it ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and large to keep his <hi>Court</hi> there, and ſpares no Art and Coſt to render it <hi>Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> and Sumptuous. Such now is the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>Man,</hi> taking Body and Soul together. He is a Stately and curious, ample and rich Building of God. The King of Glory pitch'd this <hi>Tabernacle</hi> upon Earth. The Body he form'd &amp; rais'd out of the duſt, and breath'd into his Noſtrils the breath of Life and made him this living Soul. The <hi>Body</hi> is a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Structure, and was a much more <hi>Elegant</hi> piece of Workmanſhip at the firſt: but the <hi>Spirit</hi> therein tho' Inviſible is a Creature of far more admirable and beautiful Powers.

                     <p>In whomſoever <hi>Sin</hi> reigns, in and over them <hi>Satan</hi> rules, and has poſſeſſion of them. <hi>He that committeth ſin is of the Devil, for the Devil ſinneth from the beginning.

We are <hi>born in Sin,</hi> and Satan has the firſt poſſeſſion in this State of Corruption and Apoſtacy; which remains thro' the whole Unregenerate Life. In the <hi>New Birth</hi> Satan is Ejected. If it be Enquir'd concerning any Perſon in that bleſſed hour, as it was concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the poor <hi>Lad</hi> bro't to Chriſt, foaming and gnaſhing with an unclean and cruel Spirit; Mark 9.21. <hi>How long is it agoe ſince this came unto him?</hi> It muſt be anſwered — <hi>Even of Child;</hi> yea even from his <hi>Birth,</hi> and before.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Habit</hi> of Sinful Actions, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly <hi>Courſes</hi> of wicked People, ſhows the poſſeſſion and Rule of Satan.

Joh. 8.44. <hi>Ye are of your Father the Devil, and the luſts of your Father ye do; Ye do the deeds of your Father.</hi> It is the <hi>Style</hi> of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, that he is <hi>the God of this wicked world, the Prince of the power of the Air, the ſpirit that now ruleth in the Children of Diſobedience,</hi> Eph. 2.2.

                     </p>
                     <p>To conclude, Some wicked Perſons are poſſeſſed and acted by Satan more <hi>Viſibly</hi> and <hi>Openly</hi> than others. The unclean Spirit ſhows it ſelf to the World in the abandoned Wretches, &amp; in their ſcandalous Courſes which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>e earthly, ſenſual, deviliſh. They are blinded and led blindfold by him: 2 Cor. 4.4. <hi>In whom the God of this world has blinded their

                     <p>Moreover, Satan <hi>hardens</hi> them in <hi>Sin,</hi> and his poſſeſſion of them is to be ſeen in their <hi>Security</hi> &amp; <hi>Fearleſneſs:</hi> for if the Devil were not <hi>in</hi> them, they would fear and tremble and be ſtruck with horror at their own Actions and Dangers.

II. <hi>Whence is it that Satan has poſſeſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the Souls of Men?</hi> The Palace was Gods, built for Himſelf and actually his Dwelling and Reſidence: <hi>How then came Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan into it?</hi>

                     <p>Wherefore,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Palace was betray'd into Satans hands by Mans Sin.</hi> Man <hi>delivered up himſelf</hi> to the Devil by a baſe and voluntary diſloyal <hi>yielding to his Temptation. Sin</hi> was the curſed thing that made God <hi>forſake</hi> his Palace, for he cannot dwell with it; and this gave Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan his poſſeſſion. The firſt <hi>Order</hi> and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God was, that Sin ſhould not be permitted to enter into and defile his Palace, on pain of his Departure in Wrath. God made Man Holy, Inclin'd him well, diſpoſed him only to that which is good, and to all
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:001872_0032_0FB97264CF7E0C98"/>that is ſo! He gave him an expreſs <hi>Warning</hi> and Commandment, with a ſevere and dreadful <hi>Threatning</hi> in caſe of Tranſgreſſion. The penalty was preſent Deſertion and utter Deſtruction. Nevertheleſs the Devil by craft and ſubtlety beguiled and ſeduced Man into Sin. Man weakly, ungratefully, wilfully complied with Satans Motion. He treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly gave him the <hi>Keys</hi> of the Palace, and receiv'd him into his own heart. The Holy God then forſook his Earthly Tabernacle and Reſidence. He loath'd and abhorred the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed Place. He left miſerable Man in thoſe cruel and filthy hands which he had put himſelf into. The Traitor ſurrendred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into a Tyrants hand, and renounced God his righful Proprietor, and Gracious LORD. He revolted to the Devil at his firſt Motion, from God that made him. It was a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Reſignation to the declared Enemy of God, who had appear'd to him <hi>bare fac'd,</hi> giving God the <hi>lye,</hi> and <hi>accuſed</hi> him of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying the Felicity of his Creature. He tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed in a defying manner to God, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolently dar'd his Vengeance. God was far from willing or allowing Mans fall and ruine; He did all that was proper and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to have reſtrained and prevented him: He forbid it under the pain of Death, his higheſt Diſpleaſure and an Everlaſting Exciſion from himſelf. This is the Rice and Support of Satans Kingdom here on Earth and his Dominion over Men. He
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:001872_0033_0FB972664D358FB0"/>tempted and Man yielded. God forſook and Satan uſurped. Man renounced God, revolted to Satan, and God left him to the wretchedneſs and Curſe he choſe.</p>

Thus <hi>more are with us than there are againſt us.</hi> Nevertheleſs the Rebels are <hi>Obſtinate</hi> and <hi>Deſperate;</hi> for they are never to be pardoned nor to find any Mercy.

                     <p>The quiet which Impenitent Sinners have in their evil wayes is curſed in its <hi>Original,</hi> which is of Hell; and curſed in its <hi>End</hi> and final <hi>Iſſue,</hi> which is there from whence it took its riſe.

                     </p>
                     <p>It comes of Infidelity and Unbelief, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneſs and Contempt of God, preſumption and fearleſsneſs, fleſhlineſs and ſenſuality.

                     <p>This curſed quiet and ſecurity fruſtures all Awakning Means, receives all the terrors
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:001872_0058_0FB972B1579BC708"/>of God with <hi>mildneſs</hi> and unconcern; as an <hi>Arrow</hi> ſinks ſilently into a Wall of <hi>Mud;</hi> or it <hi>roughly</hi> puts them away, as an <hi>Arrow</hi> blunts and breaks againſt a Wall of <hi>Stone.</hi> Finally, <hi>It provokes the Lord to Jealouſy,</hi> and treaſures up wrath againſt the day of wrath, and will make the Revelation of that wrath the more Surpriſing and Inſupportable.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> has therefore given us the Character and the Judgment of this Secure Sinner, his <hi>Way</hi> and his <hi>End,</hi> in diverſs paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages which are very dreadful to read, but moſt neceſſary and profitable for us to weigh. The <hi>Character</hi> of the Impiety we have, Pſal. 36.1,—4. <hi>The tranſgreſſion of the wicked ſaith within my heart, that there is no Fear of God before his Eyes. For he flattereth himſelf in his own Eyes until his Iniquity be found to be hateful. The words of his Mouth are iniquity and deceit; he hath left off to be wiſe and to do good. He deviſeth miſchief upon his Bed, he ſetteth himſelf in a way that is not good, he abhorreth not evil.</hi> What a miſerable account is here of the Perſon? Flattering himſelf on in wicked wayes without any regret or remorſe? But what is the <hi>End</hi> of it? Can it laſt alwayes? No: but as the ſoft Oyl yields the moſt Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement flame when it is ſet on fire, ſo this carnal Peace prepares and layes open a wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched Soul to the devouring fire of Gods wrath to fix and prey upon, when he comes forth to Judgment. So <hi>Moſes</hi> tells us, Deut. 29.20, 21. <hi>The Lord will not ſpare him, but
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:001872_0059_0FB972B626B38438"/>the Anger of the Lord and his Jealouſy ſhall ſmoke againſt that man, and all the Curſes that are written in this Book ſhall ly upon him, and the Lord ſhall blot out his Name from under Heaven: and the Lord ſhall ſeparate him unto Evil, according to all the Curſes of the Covenant.</hi> 
                        <q>There is ſcarce a Threatning in all the <hi>Book</hi> of God that ſounds more dreadful than this; (ſayes Mr. <hi>Henry</hi> on the Place) O that ſecure and preſumptuous Sinners would but read it and tremble! For it is not a Bugbear to frighten Children and Fools, but a real Declaration of the wrath of God againſt the Unrighteouſneſs and Ungodlineſs of Men. <hi>The Lord ſhall not ſpare him.</hi> The dayes of his Reprieve which he abuſeth ſhall be ſhortned, and no Mercy remembred in the midſt of Judgment. The <hi>Jealouſy</hi> of the Lord, which is His fierceſt Auger, ſhall <hi>Smoke</hi> as a Furnace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. The <hi>Curſes Written</hi> ſhall not only <hi>light</hi> upon him and terrifie him, but <hi>ly</hi> upon him and abide in all their weight, to ſink him down into the loweſt Hell. He ſhall be <hi>Separated unto Evil,</hi> which is the moſt proper Notion of a Curſe; <hi>Cut off</hi> from all happineſs, &amp; all hope of it; and <hi>Mark'd out</hi> for Miſery, without Remedy. And all this <hi>according to all the Curſes of the Covenant,</hi> which are the moſt fearful Curſes, being the Revenges of Abuſed Grace.</q>

III. Let the <hi>Laſt USE</hi> therefore be, <hi>To direct our feet in the way of Peace.</hi> See the Peace which you ſhould be ſeeking after. It lies in a Deliverance from Satans Thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in Penitential Mourning for Sin, in Gods Speaking Pardon to us thro' <hi>Christ,</hi> in the Fruits and Evidences of our Regeneration, the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Chriſt in us, and his <hi>Witneſſing with our Spirits that we are the Children of God.</hi>

                        <hi>Christ in our Peace.</hi> We muſt direct Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners unto Him. You muſt have your <hi>Hearts ſprinkled from an Evil Conſcience.</hi> The Blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is this <hi>blood of Sprinkling.</hi> The Soul is <hi>purified,</hi> and the Conſcience <hi>pacified,</hi> by Faith therein.</p>

His Blood quenches Guilt, and Guilt it is that ſets Conſcience on fire.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>We may not dare to heal the hurt of your Souls <hi>ſlightly, ſaying peace, peace, when there is no Peace.</hi> You muſt Repent and Believe in Chriſt, or you will <hi>die</hi> in your Sins. You

                     <p>Then all the Malice and Powers of Hell ſhall not be able to over thr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But let not the Believer in Chriſt be <hi>ſecure</hi> neither. <hi>Thou ſtandeſt by faith, be not high minded but fear.</hi> The <hi>Wiſe Virgins</hi> are too apt to <hi>Slumber,</hi> but their Fnemy is wakeful. Tho' Chriſt has pray'd for them that their faith may not <hi>fail,</hi> yet if they do not watch and pray they may ſadly <hi>fall</hi> and wound themſelves and make work for bitter Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. If you have Peace take care to keep it. <hi>Do not ſleep as do others, but watch and be ſober.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We have need to be thus <hi>Exhorting one another daily while it is called to day, leſt any be hardned thro' the deceitfulneſs of ſin.</hi> See that your <hi>hopes</hi> be well grounded, and that you are able to give a <hi>Reaſon of them with meekneſs and fear:</hi> That they be ſuch as purifie thy heart and quicken thee in Godly living. There is but <hi>one way</hi> of Peace to a Sinner,
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:001872_0074_0FB972E358481850"/>and that is to yield unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Saviour,</hi> upon the Terms of the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Chriſt is now <hi>Storming</hi> the Sinners heart, he breaks the Truce and League with Sin and Death. He gives it terrible <hi>Alarms</hi> of Judgment &amp; of Hell,<note place="margin">Mr-Baxter.</note> he batters it with the <hi>Ordnance</hi> of his Threatnings and Terrors; he ſets all in a Combuſtion of fear and ſorrow, till he force it to yield to his meer mercy.</q> Now, wilt thou yield and ſubmit to Him? To the Conditions of Peace which he offers? He will then be at Peace with thee: thy Peace may be made with God immediately thro' Him, upon the <hi>Surrender</hi> of thy ſelf to him. Do <hi>this</hi> then: Lay down the Arms of thy Rebellion, throw thy ſelf at his feet, take Him for thy LORD, ſubmit to his Rule and Government. This is the only <hi>Baſis</hi> of true and ſolid Everlaſting Peace: Iſai. 27.5. <hi>Let him take hold of my ſtrength, that he may make peace with me, and he ſhall make peace with me.</hi>

<pb n="89" facs="unknown:001872_0090_0FB9731465701370"/>It is the whole work of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wro't and carried on in the Souls of the Elect, by the Preaching of the Goſpel.

                        <hi>Two Things</hi> might be very pertinent to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve here,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>That there is no Empire or Rule in Nature like that which is over the Soul and Spirit.</hi> God governs the World, we ſay; and very truly. All his Works are ordered, directed and managed by Him. The Sun, Moon and Stars <hi>obey</hi> Him (we ſay) in all their Motions. His Will is their Rule &amp; Law which guides and limits them. But <hi>all this is not properly Government,</hi> nor ſtrictly <hi>Obedience</hi> in them. The Creature knows not the Will of its <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> nor is ſenſible of its own Being and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Uſe and Service. <hi>Government</hi> is of the Superiour, Reaſonable and Intelligent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Angels and Men</hi> Theſe are capable of <hi>Law</hi> and of a free Subjection, and a willing Service. Theſe have a Law written in their Nature. Over <hi>them</hi> therefore God reigns. Theſe are His Subjects and the People of his Kingdom, being his Nobleſt Creation and Workmanſhip. He maketh his <hi>Angels</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, the Miniſters of His Kingdom both of
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:001872_0091_0FB97315D89C79E0"/>Providence &amp; Grace; they excel in Strength, Knowledge and Holineſs. He made <hi>Man</hi> like them a Living Soul; in His own Image, who is a Spirit and the Father of Spirits; and all Souls are His, and <hi>we are His OFF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SPRING.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now here is the <hi>Perfection of Rule,</hi> of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Power; to know the Tho'ts of the heart, and ſearch it, and turn and change it as it pleaſes GOD. Others can reach the Body, order and inſpect our outward Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and puniſh the Overt Tranſgreſſion; but the Mind is free and not to be bro't under the Power of any. <hi>Humane Laws</hi> can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe only to the outward Life and Actions, and take Cognizance only of Mens Manners: But it is the Glory of God, his Laws, and his Government that he looks to the Heart within, requires the Love and Service of that, and will accept nothing leſs; but the Tho't of Wickedneſs is Sin before him and he judges therefor. Jer. 17.10. <hi>I the Lord ſearch the Heart, I try the Reins.—.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Conſcience</hi> within us is His <hi>Vicegerent.</hi> He has created it, endow'd and impower'd it, and to Him it is Accountable. He has given it Knowledge, and he Commiſſions it, and to Him it renders in its Regiſter and Teſtimony. For <hi>the Spirit of Man is the Candle of the Lord, ſearching all the inward parts of the Belly,</hi> Prov. 20.27. This is GODS Government, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he rules over the Higheſt and the leaſt. The Hearts of Kings are in his Hand and he
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:001872_0092_0FB973174F18A790"/>turns them, &amp; cuts off the Spirits of Princes. In this He appears to be the Bleſſed and Only Potentate; the King Immortal, Inviſible and only Wiſe; from whoſe Spirit and Preſence there is no hiding, no flying. Such Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is too wonderful for Man; it is High and he cannot attain unto it.</p>
                     <p>In a word, This Empire over Souls and Spirits takes in the Dominion of the <hi>vaſt Hades,</hi> the unſeen World; the <hi>Key</hi> whereof is put into the Redeemers Hand: In Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon whereof the <hi>Millions</hi> of Souls on our <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Globe</hi> are but a ſmall Number, and as a <hi>ſingle Family.</hi> How many Millions of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal spritis paſs out of this World of ours, in every Age of it, into this <hi>Hades?</hi> Beſides the <hi>Myriads</hi> of Angels and <hi>Legions</hi> of Devils there before! What a Kingdom of God is <hi>here</hi> without limits, or any Number of its Hoſts! <hi>this Empire over Souls or Spirits!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To theſe GOD has ſubjected the reſt of his Glorious <hi>Creation,</hi> made them for Dominion, &amp; <hi>put all things under their feet;</hi> reſerving <hi>them</hi> to be his <hi>Own Dominion</hi> and Servants, becauſe the Superiour Orders of Being.</p>
                     <p>This is the firſt Note which I commended to your ſerious Attention, That there is no Empire or Rule in Nature like that which is over the Soul and Spirit. The next <hi>Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> I would make is,</p>
                     <p n="2">II. <hi>That there is no Rule or Empire over Souls here on Earth like that which God diſplays
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:001872_0093_0FB97318E0B0DDB0"/>in the Work of Sanctification,</hi> or his ſaving work of Grace wro't and carried on in our Souls by His Holy Spirit. There are other wonderful Proofs and Inſtances of GODS Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning the Spirits of Men in the common Rule of His Providence: there being indeed no ſuch thing at all as a Providence over Humane Affairs, without a particular Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of and Power over Mens Spirits; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting and over-ruling them as the Alwiſe <hi>Governour of Heaven and Earth</hi> ſees meet and neceſſary; Inclining or reſtraining them, and changing their Purpoſes and Counſels, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own Will &amp; unto his own Glory. There is a powerful inſenſible Operation of Providence on the Spirits of Men, which puts no force on their Freedom, Liberty and Choice, but yet governs their Will to its own Purpoſe and Council. But now the Work of Grace, Converſion &amp; Regeneration, and the progreſs of our Sanctification is a more <hi>manifeſt and Eminent Empire of GOD</hi> over our Spirits than all this.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>It is Gods Glorious Efficiency.</hi> The <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Power</hi> is of GOD and not of Man. The Word is the Power of GOD un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Salvation. The Day of a Souls Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is the Day of GODS Power<note n="‖" place="bottom">1 Cor. 1.18. 4.20. Pſal. 110.3. 2 Cor. 4.7. Eph. 1.19.</note> For who but GOD can change the Soul? give a new heart? renew the Mind and Spirit? form
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:001872_0094_0FB97323CFCC4020"/>and make a New Creature? For there is a new Mind given, a new Will, new Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, new Purpoſes and Reſolutions, new Strength and Power, and ſo a newneſs of Life produced. This is Dominion, Rule and Government over our Spirits with a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: An Abſolute Power exerted upon them, whereby they are reformed and reſtored, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Will, and into the Image of God, who worketh all in all. <hi>This is the Exceeding Greatneſs of His Power to Us-ward who believe, according to the Working of his Mighty Power.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>It is all Efyected &amp; Carried on in a way of Rule &amp; Government: by a Divine Regency which is moſt Free and Gracious.</hi> An Act of true Dominion, bringing the Reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in a Way agreable to its rational Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Liberty &amp; Faculties, into a choſen Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to God. To ſet this in a true light we need only conſider the <hi>Means</hi> which the Holy Ghoſt uſes, and the <hi>Method</hi> which he takes with us in this glorious Work: And this is ſuch as is moſt proper to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a <hi>Soul.</hi> That is to ſay, He works on the Soul <hi>by that Inſpired Word and revealed Law</hi> which He hath given for our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to regulate us &amp; to be Obeyed by us. His <hi>Word</hi> is the Rule of Holineſs and of our Duty. It preſcribes both to the Outward Life, and to the Inward Tho'ts, Affections &amp; Deſires. It is a Law to our Conſciences, and it is quick &amp; powerful as a Sword to peirce
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:001872_0095_0FB97324D0F3BCA8"/>into the Inmoſt Soul; a Diſcerner of the Tho'ts and intents of the Hearts, and a judge of them. This Divine Word is the <hi>Ordinary Means</hi> which the Spirit of GOD uſes in Convincing &amp; Converting Sinners; and to that End the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> and <hi>Preaching</hi> of it is Ordained, and by the Bleſſing of GOD with it is made Inſtrumental &amp; Efficacious. Now this is Agreable to our Nature and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Government of Reaſonable Creatures. <hi>For God made Man to be rul'd by a Law and Precept.</hi> He wrote his Law in Mans heart at firſt, and ſome Remains of it abide in his Apoſtacy. He gov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rn'd Man in his Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by a Law and Commandment, requiring a perfect Obedience of him; by a Promiſe and a Threatning, by Hopes &amp; Fears. And ſo he doth yet by the <hi>Written</hi> Law, Precepts and Prohibitions, Promiſes and Threats. He uſes the proper Means, Humane and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, to Inform Enlighten and Convince the <hi>Judgment,</hi> to perſwade and overcome the <hi>Will,</hi> to move the <hi>Affections,</hi> Deſire and Loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, Love and Hatred, Hope &amp; Fear, Grief and Joy; and by all to Alarm the <hi>Conſcience,</hi> Encourage and Deter us, as His Glory and our Happineſs do direct. In this way Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Grace gets the Dominion again in the Soul of Man, and in this way it maintains it: Which is the Way of a <hi>Rational Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> the Governing <hi>by Law</hi> free &amp; Intelligent Beings. The Divine Government in our Souls is upheld by the Law of the Kingdom.
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:001872_0096_0FB9732782853F98"/>
                        <hi>Faith comes by Hearing, and Hearing by the Word of God. Of His own Will be begets us by the Word of Truth. The Commandment comes and the Sinner dies</hi>
                        <note n="‖" place="bottom">Rom. 10.17. James 1.18. Rom. 7.8, 9.</note> So he is bro't to the foot of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to kneel to the <hi>Scepter</hi> of his Grace.</p>
                     <p>Thus the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> accompanies this Word of the Kingdom with an Inviſible and Irreſiſtible Bleſſing, whereby he ſubdues the Enmity of the Heart againſt the Divine Law, and brings it to ſubmit freely thereunto.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Herein is the Kingdom of Satan in the Soul overthrown, and the Oppoſite glorious Reign of Holineſs ſet up in its stead.</hi> Satan is diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed and Souls recovered from Sin unto God. The Dominion of Sin is broken, and the Scepter of Chriſt bow'd to, the Laws of Holineſs obeyed. So that here is a proper <hi>Conquest</hi> and <hi>Reduction</hi> of the Soul from the Tyranny of Satan, and from Slavery to him into the Glorious Liberty of the Children of God.

Thus the <hi>World</hi> is overcome, and this is the Victory even our Faith: The <hi>Fleſh</hi> is Crucified with its Affections and Luſts, and <hi>Satan</hi> is reſiſted ſtedfaſtly and bruiſed under our feet.

The <hi>Crowns</hi> of Glory which fell from the Heads of theſe Apoſtate Spirits, the Redeemed Saints of Chriſt aſcend to <hi>wear;</hi> and they reign in thoſe <hi>Thrones,</hi> from which theſe were caſt down to Hell.

                  <p n="1">1. I obſerve, <hi>What a bold and confident Enemy we have.</hi> How he <hi>arms</hi> himſelf and <hi>comes out,</hi> like ſome <hi>Goliah</hi> defying the Armies of the living God; <hi>Confident</hi> in himſelf and in his own Strength; <hi>threatning</hi> what he <hi>can</hi> do and what he <hi>will.</hi> He makes <hi>ſhow</hi> of Courage. Fearleſsneſs and Security. He ſeems to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe Heaven, to pretend to hold his own, and maintain his Kingdom among Men, in ſpite of God. <hi>All theſe are Mine,</hi> ſaid the bold and vaunting <hi>Spirit</hi> to our <hi>Saviour, and I do what I will with them.</hi> And if <hi>Heaven</hi> denies his Title he pretends to defend it; Rev. 12.7. <hi>And the Devil fought and his Angels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs all this is only <hi>Grimmace,</hi> and a <hi>face put on,</hi> which the heart gives the lie unto. He looks big and fierce; ſpeaks Great, and roars like a Lion. But for all that he <hi>believes and trembles.</hi> He knows that his day is coming, and <hi>ſhreiks</hi> and <hi>flies</hi> at the tho't of the time of his Torment. As he fell in horror before our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and cried out, and tore and rav'd; and (as he cou'd) <hi>pray'd to his Judge;</hi> in the moſt abject and torturing fears that any <hi>weak mind</hi> can feel.</p>
                  <p>He is bold to us becauſe <hi>Inviſible.</hi> Could

So a <hi>Wolf</hi> appears and is terrible to a Lamb, but what a <hi>cur</hi> is it before a Lion? How will the <hi>Wild Barking Dog</hi> fly more fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than a Lamb?</p>
                  <p>So it is <hi>the property of an Inſolent Spirit to Inſult</hi> thoſe that are Ignorant or Feeble; Whom it can deceive or fright, impoſe on and terrifie, it is always ready to <hi>hector</hi> and <hi>bully.</hi> Beſides that our Enemy is <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>impudent,</hi> as he is proud and cruel; He covers his own ſhame and weakneſs, fears and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors with lies and folſhood; and never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears what he is. <hi>We have a bold and confident Enemy.</hi>

                  <p>Now this <hi>Armour of Satan</hi> is the ſame with thoſe <hi>Strong holds</hi> of his in a wicked heart, which I before ſpake of under the <hi>Second Doctrine,</hi> whereby he holds it as a <hi>Garriſon</hi> againſt God, in a wretched and <hi>accurſed Peace</hi> and Security.</p>

                  <p>WORSHIP <hi>is a Divine and Excellent Duty or Service. The Nobleſt</hi> Powers <hi>of the Soul are Exerciſed, in the most noble</hi> manner, <hi>upon the moſt Excellent</hi> Object. <hi>The Holy</hi> Diſpoſitions <hi>which God hath created in the</hi> Regenerate, <hi>and the Divine</hi> Principles <hi>which he has implanted in them, as they are the things most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the</hi> New Nature, <hi>ſo being Exerted by ſupernatural Aſſiſtances, they muſt needs yield it the</hi> Divineſt Joyes.</p>
                  <p>Chriſtians <hi>ſhould have great Pleaſure in the</hi> Society <hi>of one another in Acts of Worſhip.</hi> Solitary <hi>Worſhip is neceſſary, and in its ſeaſon is pleaſant to the Soul, and ſo is</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Worſhip. <hi>In</hi> Heaven <hi>it may be the Worſhip is all Open &amp;</hi> Social: <hi>Every Breaſt is always full of Devotion, and ever running over. At preſent we</hi> need <hi>more the aſſiſtance of one another in our Devotion.</hi> As Iron ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens Iron, <hi>ſo do the devout Faces of</hi> Chriſtian Brethren <hi>hearten &amp; brighten one another in the publick Solemnities of GOD's Houſe.</hi>

                     <p>To which I might have added, the <hi>Frame, Ends</hi> and <hi>Fruits</hi> of this holy Exerciſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If we conſider the <hi>Glorious Object of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, the Bleſſed GOD;</hi> it will eaſily appear that we ſhould be very glad of every call we have to go up to his Houſe. God is the moſt <hi>Delectable Object</hi> which the Soul of Man can converſe with, being infinitely poſſeſſed of all poſſible Perfections, Excellencies and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Therefore to approach unto him ſhou'd be the higheſt Pleaſure of our Souls; and if we were in our <hi>Original State of Rectitude</hi> it certainly wou'd be ſo. We have directly to do with <hi>God</hi> in our ſolemn Acts of Worſhip, <hi>Him</hi> we ſpeak and addreſs unto immediately, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>d <hi>He</hi> ſpeaks to us; to him we make our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                           <desc>••••</desc>
                        </gap>rings, and of him we ſupplicate for Grace and Mercy. Now God is the ſupream Object of the delight of all <hi>Intelligent Beings,</hi> and the whole of Religion lies very much in
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:001872_0139_0FB973A076DC28B0"/>that Precept, Pſal. 33.4. <hi>Delight thy ſelf in the Lord.</hi> If we were called to go to the Preſence of our <hi>Earthly Ring,</hi> to ask and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any Favours from him, being aſſured that it wou'd be very acceptable to him to ſee and hear us with our Petition, with what Joy and Pleaſure ſhou'd we go to preſent our ſelves before him? In like manner when we go to worſhip, we ſhou'd <hi>go unto God as our exceding Joy,</hi> Pſal. 43.4.</p>
                     <p>And accordingly this has been the <hi>Frame</hi> of worſhipping Saints. As they have had Joy in worſhipping, ſo their Rejoycing has been eſpecially in the <hi>Glorious Object</hi> they Adored. Pſal. 9.2. <hi>I will be glad and rejoyce in thee, I will ſing praiſe to thy Name, O wast High.</hi> Pſal. 32.11. <hi>Be glad in the Lord and rejoyce ye Righteous.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Indeed if God were not infinitely to be <hi>delighted</hi> in on the account of his Eſſential Glories and Perfections, he wou'd not be the <hi>Object</hi> of worſhip, neither wou'd there be any <hi>Pleaſure</hi> in worſhip. Make the <hi>Object</hi> of worſhip any other but <hi>God,</hi> and there is no <hi>Satisfaction</hi> in any Act of <hi>Adoration.</hi> For In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, <hi>What a dull and stupid thing muſt is be to worſhip a graven Image;</hi> a <hi>dumb</hi> and <hi>de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

One wou'd think (that is) that the <hi>Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> had no more Underſtanding than the <hi>Stock</hi> which he adores, and that one was as inſenſible <hi>a piece of Wood</hi> as the other. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> amplifies with a great deal of holy Scorn and <hi>Sarcaſm</hi> on this head: Iſai. 44 9, 10, &amp;c. <hi>Who hath formed a God that is profitable for nothing! they and their delectable things are vanity: the Carpenter ſtretches out his rule, marks it out with a line, fitteth it with planes, makes the figure of a Man, according to the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Man, warms himſelf with the chips, and then falls down and worſhips it, and ſaith to it, Deliver me, for thou art my God.</hi> Now to be ſure there can be no more pleaſure in the <hi>Adoring,</hi> than there was in the <hi>hewing and hacking the Log.</hi> Which is the moſt a <hi>Stock</hi> at laſt, the <hi>Image</hi> or its <hi>Adorer</hi> is leſt doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. And as the <hi>Idol</hi> is inſenſible of any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in being worſhipt, ſo muſt the <hi>fottiſh Man</hi> be in worſhipping, <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>They have not known nor underſtood, for he hath ſhut their Eyes that they cannot ſee, and their hearts that they cannot underſtand.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that all the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of Pleaſure in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip muſt be from the glorious Object, GOD.

                     <p n="2">II. If we conſider <hi>the Acts and holy Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of publick Worſhip,</hi> it will eaſily appear to be our duty to be very glad of every Call and Opportunity we have to go up into the Houſe of God. Every <hi>Part</hi> of religious inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Worſhip is in it ſelf highly pleaſurable unto a Heart ſuitably diſpoſed and prepared.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Parts of Worſhip</hi> I wou'd name are Theſe, <hi>Prayer, Singing, Hearing,</hi> the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and receiving the <hi>Benediction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Prayer</hi> is ſuch a Duty as we ſhou'd be glad to wait upon God in his Houſe in. <hi>His Houſe is called the houſe of Prayer.</hi> The <hi>Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,</hi> and <hi>Temple</hi> were ſuch of old.

5. <hi>Profeſſion and Self-Conſecration are other Acts in Prayer,</hi> which ſhould make us glad of every Seaſon of ſolemn Approach to Him. We ſhould in our Prayers give our ſelves <hi>up</hi> to the Lord, lay hold on his <hi>Covenant,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new our own <hi>Engagements</hi> to be his; <hi>pay him our Vows,</hi> preſent our ſelves a <hi>Living Sacrifice,</hi> and bind our ſelves afreſh to him. Our <hi>Baptiſm</hi> ſhould be ever remembred by us, and we ſhould rejoyce with fear; commending our ſelves to his Grace, and committing our Souls to his Keeping. Pſal. 119.94. <hi>I am thine, ſave me.</hi> Pſal. 116.13, 16. <hi>I will take the cup of ſalvation: and call upon the name of the Lord. I will pay my vows unto the Lord: now in the preſence of all his people. O Lord, truly I am thy ſervant, I am thy ſervant, and the ſon of thy handmaid: thou haſt looſed my bonds.</hi> So the pleaſed Servant among the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> went gladly to the door of his <hi>Masters</hi> houſe to <hi>bore his Ear there.</hi> It ſhould be pleaſant to us to <hi>Avouch</hi> the Lord in the moſt Publick and Explicit manner to be our God, and that we are his People; and to put in our <hi>Claims</hi> to the Bleſſings of his Covenant while we put our <hi>Names</hi> to the bonds of it.

6. <hi>Interceſſion for Others</hi> is another part of Prayer, which ſhould make it pleaſant to us to go up unto the Houſe of Prayer. Prayer is a <hi>Generous</hi> &amp; <hi>Noble</hi> duty, breathing the moſt diffuſive Love &amp; extenſive Charity. 1 Tim. 2. Init. <hi>I exhort therefore that ſupplications, prayers, interceſſions &amp; giving of thanks be made for all men;—for this is good and acceptable in the ſight of God our Saviour, who will have all men to be ſaved and to come unto the knowledge of the Truth.</hi> How pleaſant ſhould it be to bear the World of Mankind thus in an <hi>Enlarged heart</hi> before God, for his Mercies &amp; Bleſſings to be ſhowred down upon them! How plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant by expreſſions of faith and love to teſtify our Communion <hi>with all that in Every place call upon the Name of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, both theirs and ours.</hi> How pleaſant to keep and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the Unity of the Spirit, the Oneneſs of Saints all the World over! And to realize our ſelves intereſted in their Supplications at the Throne of Grace, while we embrace them in the chearful Arms of our love; as the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Ones in the Earth, in whom is all our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,</hi> and to whom our Goodneſs extends, at leaſt in a hearty Benevolence and Good-will, tho' not in any actual Beneficence. Such kind and tender concern, ſuch affection and eſteem the Children of God have for one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whoſe faces they are never to ſee in the fleſh, but whom they hope one day to ſee in Heaven, that <hi>their hearts might be comforted
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:001872_0148_0FB973B8EABDE8E8"/>being knit together in love, and unto all Riches of the full aſſurance of Underſtanding, to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the myſtery of God, and of the Father and of Chriſt,</hi> Col. 2. Init. And <hi>how good &amp; pleaſant is it for Brethren</hi> thus to dwell together in love, their Prayers being promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hereby; bearing one another like <hi>holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives</hi> on their hearts to the God of all Grace, in a gracious Sympathy and Care for each others Concerns both Temporal &amp; Eternal. Phil. 1.2, 3, 4. <hi>Grace be unto you and Peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. I thank my God upon every Remembrance of you; alwayes in every prayer of mine for you all making requeſt with joy; for their fellowſhip in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel from the firſt day until Now.</hi> Truly if there be any <hi>Conſolation</hi> in Chriſt, if any <hi>Comfort of love,</hi> if any <hi>Fellowſhip of the Spirit,</hi> if any <hi>Bowels</hi> and <hi>Mercies,</hi> it is to be found in the <hi>Mutual Interceſſions of Saints:</hi> Herein they <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill</hi> their own and others <hi>Joy, if they be like minded, having the ſame love, being of one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, of one mind.</hi> Phil. 2.1, 2.</p>
                     <p>Thus there is nothing but what is very pleaſant in <hi>every part</hi> of Prayer. Only we muſt give our ſelves to the <hi>Duty,</hi> and get the <hi>Spirit of Prayer</hi> if we would experience this. For to be ſure, a carnal and wicked heart, a careleſs and formal Spirit, a worldly &amp; fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mind, can never favour or experience <hi>theſe Truths.</hi>
                     </p>

II.
