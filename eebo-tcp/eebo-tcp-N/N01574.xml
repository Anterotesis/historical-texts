         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This is common to <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Men;</hi> Heaven is His Throne, and the Earth His Foot≈øtool; but Angels the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Heaven, and Men the People of His Pa≈øture Earth, were His own de≈øigned Habitation and Re≈øidence. He made both one and other in His own <hi>Image,</hi> in His like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs. The Realms above He prepared for Angels; this Earth a <hi>Paradi≈øe</hi> for Man, whom He placed an <hi>Imbodied Angel</hi> upon it, a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øtial Mind clothed in fle≈øh, crowned with

                     <p>For what is a <hi>Palace?</hi> but ≈øome Dwelling of a <hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>King,</hi> which he builds for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, for the <hi>Honour of his Maje≈øty,</hi> and to ≈øhew <hi>the Riches of his Kingdom.</hi> He builds it ≈øpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and large to keep his <hi>Court</hi> there, and ≈øpares no Art and Co≈øt to render it <hi>Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> and Sumptuous. Such now is the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>Man,</hi> taking Body and Soul together. He is a Stately and curious, ample and rich Building of God. The King of Glory pitch'd this <hi>Tabernacle</hi> upon Earth. The Body he form'd &amp; rais'd out of the du≈øt, and breath'd into his No≈øtrils the breath of Life and made him this living Soul.

<pb n="31" facs="unknown:001872_0032_0FB97264CF7E0C98"/>that is ≈øo!

The Traitor ≈øurrendred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf into a Tyrants hand, and renounced God his righful Proprietor, and Gracious LORD.

III. Let the <hi>La≈øt USE</hi> therefore be, <hi>To direct our feet in the way of Peace.</hi> See the Peace which you ≈øhould be ≈øeeking after. It lies in a Deliverance from Satans Thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in Penitential Mourning for Sin, in Gods Speaking Pardon to us thro' <hi>Christ,</hi> in the Fruits and Evidences of our Regeneration, the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Chri≈øt in us, and his <hi>Witne≈ø≈øing with our Spirits that we are the Children of God.</hi>

                        <hi>Christ in our Peace.</hi> We mu≈øt direct Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners unto Him. You mu≈øt have your <hi>Hearts ≈øprinkled from an Evil Con≈øcience.</hi> The Blood of <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> is this <hi>blood of Sprinkling.</hi> The Soul is <hi>purified,</hi> and the Con≈øcience <hi>pacified,</hi> by Faith therein.</p>

His Blood quenches Guilt, and Guilt it is that ≈øets Con≈øcience on fire.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>We may not dare to heal the hurt of your Souls <hi>≈ølightly, ≈øaying peace, peace, when there is no Peace.</hi> You mu≈øt Repent and Believe in Chri≈øt, or you will <hi>die</hi> in your Sins. You

                     <p>But let not the Believer in Chri≈øt be <hi>≈øecure</hi> neither. <hi>Thou ≈øtande≈øt by faith, be not high minded but fear.</hi> The <hi>Wi≈øe Virgins</hi> are too apt to <hi>Slumber,</hi> but their Fnemy is wakeful.

If you have Peace take care to keep it. <hi>Do not ≈øleep as do others, but watch and be ≈øober.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We have need to be thus <hi>Exhorting one another daily while it is called to day, le≈øt any be hardned thro' the deceitfulne≈øs of ≈øin.</hi> See that your <hi>hopes</hi> be well grounded, and that you are able to give a <hi>Rea≈øon of them with meekne≈øs and fear:</hi> That they be ≈øuch as purifie thy heart and quicken thee in Godly living. There is but <hi>one way</hi> of Peace to a Sinner,
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:001872_0074_0FB972E358481850"/>and that is to yield unto <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> the <hi>Saviour,</hi> upon the Terms of the Go≈øpel.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Chri≈øt is now <hi>Storming</hi> the Sinners heart, he breaks the Truce and League with Sin and Death. He gives it terrible <hi>Alarms</hi> of Judgment &amp; of Hell,<note place="margin">Mr-Baxter.</note> he batters it with the <hi>Ordnance</hi> of his Threatnings and Terrors; he ≈øets all in a Combu≈øtion of fear and ≈øorrow, till he force it to yield to his meer mercy.</q> Now, wilt thou yield and ≈øubmit to Him? To the Conditions of Peace which he offers? He will then be at Peace with thee: thy Peace may be made with God immediately thro' Him, upon the <hi>Surrender</hi> of thy ≈øelf to him. Do <hi>this</hi> then: Lay down the Arms of thy Rebellion, throw thy ≈øelf at his feet, take Him for thy LORD, ≈øubmit to his Rule and Government. This is the only <hi>Ba≈øis</hi> of true and ≈øolid Everla≈øting Peace: I≈øai. 27.5. <hi>Let him take hold of my ≈øtrength, that he may make peace with me, and he ≈øhall make peace with me.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>That there is no Empire or Rule in Nature like that which is over the Soul and Spirit.</hi> God governs the World, we ≈øay; and very truly. All his Works are ordered, directed and managed by Him. The Sun, Moon and Stars <hi>obey</hi> Him (we ≈øay) in all their Motions. His Will is their Rule &amp; Law which guides and limits them.

The≈øe have a Law written in their Nature. Over <hi>them</hi> therefore God reigns. The≈øe are His Subjects and the People of his Kingdom, being his Noble≈øt Creation and Workman≈øhip. He maketh his <hi>Angels</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, the Mini≈øters of His Kingdom both of

                     </p>
                     <p>Now here is the <hi>Perfection of Rule,</hi> of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Power; to know the Tho'ts of the heart, and ≈øearch it, and turn and change it as it plea≈øes GOD.

Jer. 17.10. <hi>I the Lord ≈øearch the Heart, I try the Reins.‚Äî.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Con≈øcience</hi> within us is His <hi>Vicegerent.</hi> He has created it, endow'd and impower'd it, and to Him it is Accountable. He has given it Knowledge, and he Commi≈ø≈øions it, and to Him it renders in its Regi≈øter and Te≈øtimony. For <hi>the Spirit of Man is the Candle of the Lord, ≈øearching all the inward parts of the Belly,</hi> Prov. 20.27.

There is a powerful in≈øen≈øible Operation of Providence on the Spirits of Men, which puts no force on their Freedom, Liberty and Choice, but yet governs their Will to its own Purpo≈øe and Council. But now the Work of Grace, Conver≈øion &amp; Regeneration, and the progre≈øs of our Sanctification is a more <hi>manife≈øt and Eminent Empire of GOD</hi> over our Spirits than all this.</p>

5. <hi>Profe≈ø≈øion and Self-Con≈øecration are other Acts in Prayer,</hi> which ≈øhould make us glad of every Sea≈øon of ≈øolemn Approach to Him.

6. <hi>Interce≈ø≈øion for Others</hi> is another part of Prayer, which ≈øhould make it plea≈øant to us to go up unto the Hou≈øe of Prayer.

How plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øant by expre≈ø≈øions of faith and love to te≈øtify our Communion <hi>with all that in Every place call upon the Name of Je≈øus Chri≈øt our Lord, both theirs and ours.</hi> How plea≈øant to keep and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øt the Unity of the Spirit, the Onene≈øs of Saints all the World over!

And <hi>how good &amp; plea≈øant is it for Brethren</hi> thus to dwell together in love, their Prayers being promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hereby; bearing one another like <hi>holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives</hi> on their hearts to the God of all Grace, in a gracious Sympathy and Care for each others Concerns both Temporal &amp; Eternal. Phil. 1.2, 3, 4. <hi>Grace be unto you and Peace from God our Father and from the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt. I thank my God upon every Remembrance of you; alwayes in every prayer of mine for you all making reque≈øt with joy; for their fellow≈øhip in the Go≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel from the fir≈øt day until Now.</hi> Truly if there be any <hi>Con≈øolation</hi> in Chri≈øt, if any <hi>Comfort of love,</hi> if any <hi>Fellow≈øhip of the Spirit,</hi> if any <hi>Bowels</hi> and <hi>Mercies,</hi> it is to be found in the <hi>Mutual Interce≈ø≈øions of Saints:</hi> Herein they <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill</hi> their own and others <hi>Joy, if they be like minded, having the ≈øame love, being of one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, of one mind.</hi> Phil. 2.1, 2.</p>
                     <p>Thus there is nothing but what is very plea≈øant in <hi>every part</hi> of Prayer. Only we mu≈øt give our ≈øelves to the <hi>Duty,</hi> and get the <hi>Spirit of Prayer</hi> if we would experience this.
