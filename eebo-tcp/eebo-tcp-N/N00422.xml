            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AT A General COURT Held at Charlstown by Adjournment. Feb. 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1689/90.</head>
            <p>THis Court taking into their serious Consideration the many Calls of God's Providence upon his People, to be much and often in solemn manner imploring his Favour; and having by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence found it good to draw nigh to God, <hi>who will be sought to by the House of Israel,</hi> Do therefore Recommend to the earnest Supplications of all that fear God, the common Interest of the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the World, which hath so many potent Adversaries; as also the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of such Scripture-Prophesies, as seem to be near the birth, and must be ushered in with Prayer. More specially the present state of our own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with their Allies; that the Wars in <hi>Ireland</hi> may have a good issue; that all Animosities amongst God's People may be removed, and their hearts uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; that King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> may have their Throne Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and be made great Blessings: That Peace and Truth may flourish in those Kingdoms under their happy Conduct.</p>
            <p>The Condition also of the Land we live in, which is under many awful Frowns of God; That He will pardon the Sins that have so provoked Him; that He will reform and heal us; that He will preserve us from the Rage of our Heathen Enemies; that He will improve and prosper us in winning the Natives of the Country, to the saving Knowledge and Obedience of the only True God; that so there may be One Fold, and One Shepherd: That He will guard us against Foreign Invasion; take away the prevailing and mortal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers of the Fever and Small Pox. That <hi>He</hi> will provide for us a Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Liberties, giving us to that end, Favour with our Soveraign: De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feating all Enterprises against us: Preserving and giving good success to our Agents: affording Direction in the management of all our arduous Affairs: That He will uphold our Churches, bless our Seed-time and Harvest: that there may be no Famine of Bread, nor of Hearing the Words of the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now that all Persons, in their several Places; Ministers and People, may with the more Intenseness and Solemnity apply themselves, to so great and seasonable a Duty: This Court doth Appoint the sixth of</hi> March <hi>next, to be Observed as a Day of Publick <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Fasting</hi> throughout this Jurisdiction; Hereby For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding all Servile Labour thereon.</hi>
