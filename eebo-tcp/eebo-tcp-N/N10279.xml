            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <bibl>EXODUS I.8.</bibl> NOW THERE AROSE UP A NEW KING OVER EGYPT, WHICH KNEW NOT JOSEPH.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T will be thought ſtrange, no doubt, at leaſt at firſt view, that the preacher ſhould make choice of a Text like this, upon ſuch an occaſion as the preſent. The audience will ſay,
<q>What relation can the ſtory of Joſeph, and the hiſtory of the Egyptian kings, have to the important buſineſs on which we are aſſembled? What remarks can be made on Pharaoh's ignorance of Joſeph, on his cruel oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Hebrews, or on his deſpotic government of his Egyptian ſubjects, which can afford inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or entertainment ſuited to the circumſtances of this free meeting?</q>
However if we view the words more accurately, and enter fully into the ſtory of which they are a part, we may, perhaps, judge, that none could have been more proper: That no topick could have given a finer lead to ſuch ſentiments, as are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly adapted to an occaſion like the preſent.</p>
            <p>THE Egyptians ſeem to have been particularly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, in along ſucceſſion of native kings, from the reign of Miſraim or Menes, the founder of the kingdom of Egypt, to the reign of Concharis or Timaeus, the twenty fifth king of Tanis or of the lower diviſion of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013049_0004_0F8FF64094AC1570"/>
Egypt, for the term of about ſix centuries and a half<note n="*" place="bottom">Miſraim who was the firſt king of Egypt, is ſuppoſed to have built Zoan, the ſeat of the Egyptian kings, in thoſe early ages, and to have founded the kingdom of Egypt A. M. 1772. The conqueſt of Egypt, by the Shepherds, is thought to have happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the fifth year of the reign of Timaeus, A. M. 2420, which is 648 years later, near ſix centuries and a half. If we ſhould reckon from the building of Noph or Memphis, and from the beginning of the reign of Naphtuhim, about A<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> M. 1777, the period will include 643 years.</note>. During this long period the Egyptians, (as did moſt nations in theſe early times,) enjoyed great freedom, noble immunities and privileges. Eſpecially, was this the caſe, until the latter part of the reign of Thuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mares, the twentieth king of Tanis or of the lower diviſion of Egypt. About the thirteenth year of his reign Joſeph the Hebrew was advanced to the office of prime miniſter in the court of Pharaoh. Near thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years after his advancement, towards the cloſe of that remarkable famine, which then prevailed over Egypt, and all the neighbouring kingdoms, he bought the Egyptians themſelves, as he had their lands and cattle before. From this time they became the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and tenants of Pharaoh, and their former privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges ſuffered a great eclipſe. They now held their lands of the crown, tilled them for Pharaoh, and gave a fifth of their increaſe, as an annual acknowledgement and tribute to their prince.</p>
            <p>JOSEPH, who had been a father to Pharaoh, and to his ſubjects, ſeemeth to have ſupported his character, not only during the reign of Thuſimares, but alſo during the three ſucceeding reigns: and to have been prime miniſter, in the courts of four princes ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, for the term of about eighty years.</p>
            <p>THE government under his adminiſtration, ſeemeth to have been wiſe and gentle: and the people, though abridged of ſome, yet had many privileges left them.</p>
            <p>THE great abilities and integrity of Joſeph, with the eminent ſervices he had done in Egypt, rendered
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013049_0005_0F8FF6430505F320"/>
his name and memory dear, both to the princes whom he had ſerved, and to the people whoſe ſaviour, as well as ruler he had been. He had advanced the crown of Egypt to a ſtate of grandeur and oppulence, which, before this time, had been unknown in that, and, perhaps, in every other kingdom.</p>
            <p>LONG, no doubt, had the memory of Joſeph and of his ſervices been precious, and his name been honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Egyptian princes and their ſubjects, had a ſucceſſion of native kings continued to hold the ſceptre. Long, no doubt, the children of Jacob would, not only, have continued to flouriſh, but would, for his ſake, have obtained protection.</p>
            <p>BUT about fifty years after his death, the kingdom was transferred to a foreigner.
<q>Now there aroſe up a new King over Egypt, which knew not Joſeph.</q>
That is, a king of another family and nation<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Joſephus in his Antiquities, Book II, ſaith, When the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was transferred to another family the Egyptians treated the Iſraelites inhumanly, contrived to oppreſs them, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Other Hiſtorians ſay, This new king, who knew not Joſeph, was a foreigner, who with a numerous army of Aſſyrians, or Phaenicians, or of the Arabians, or more probably of the ancient Horims invaded and conquered Egypt, and called themſelves Paſtors or Shepherds. Shuckford's Con. Vol. II. P. 206—210.</p>
               </note>. This new or foreign king, is ſuppoſed to have been Salatis, the firſt of the Shepherd kings, as they are commonly called. He, about the fifth year of the reign of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charis or Timaeus, led a numerous army of foreigners, (probably the ancient Horites, whom the children of Eſau, about this time, expelled from Mount Seir,) againſt Egypt. They marked their way with terrible ſlaughter and devaſtation. The inhabitants were ſlain, their cities and houſes laid in aſhes, and the country, unable to reſiſt the fury and valour of theſe bloody invaders, ſoon made its ſubmiſſion. The conquerors, advanced Salatis, their principal leader, to the throne. HE knew not JOSEPH. He was a ſtranger to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and ſervices. He had no particular connections
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013049_0006_0F8FF643EDA5C698"/>
with the Egyptians or Hebrews. He had contracted no particular friendſhip or regard for either. How dear ſoever the benefactors and ſaviours of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try were to the native inhabitants, it little affected him Their good ſervices to a country, for whoſe welfare, he cared nothing, could have little influence indeed with him. To maintain himſelf upon the throne, to which he had waded through blood and ſlaughter, to reward his friends, and fix them in his intereſt, (as is uſually the caſe in ſuch revolutions,) was his ſpecial care. He therefore diſtributed the lands among his ſoldiers, enſlaved the ancient inhabitants, ſubjected the country to tribute, and garriſoned it at pleaſure<note n="*" place="bottom">Shuckford's Connection, Vol. II, P. 205.</note>.</p>
            <p>HAD he been a native of the country, the intereſt of it would have been dear to him. A thouſand ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der connections would have been formed with his countrymen. The intereſts and happineſs of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would have been connected with his own, and in many reſpects inſeperable from them. To the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the wiſe men of his country, to the religion, cuſtoms, benefactors, and ſaviours of it, he would have naturally paid a particular veneration and regard. Theſe would have all united their influence in favour of a mild and happy government. But now they were all caſt into the oppoſite ſcale, and operated to aggrandize the conquerors, to enſlave and ruin the native inhabitants.</p>
            <p>THE HEBREWS, who were ſettled chiefly in the lower Egypt, and were a brave, numerous, and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing people, and bid the faireſt to give trouble to the uſurper, and to reſtore the country to its ancient freedom, he took particular care to enſlave: and by every ſpecies of tyranny to oppreſs and keep low. In a word, by theſe foreigners, the ancient form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was wholly ſubverted, and the Egyptians from a free, flouriſhing and happy people, were reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a ſtate of ſlavery and wretchedneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:013049_0007_0F8FF6441E1F78B8"/>FROM this hiſtorical ſketch of the new king it will not be unnatural to remark,</p>
            <p>THAT as the government of a people, by their free-born ſons, hath the happieſt tendency to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and perpetuate their valuable rights and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges; ſo the introduction of foreigners, to civil rule, hath the moſt efficacious tendency to ſubvert their conſtitution, and to reduce them to a ſtate of ſlavery and wretchedneſs.</p>
            <p>THE illuſtration of this obſervation will naturally conduct me into ſuch a field of diſcourſe, as, I flatter myſelf, could it be executed, in any meaſure, equal to the nature and importance of the ſubject, would by no means fail to fix the attention of my audience, and agreeably to entertain them, on this joyful anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary.</p>
            <p>THE proviſion made, by the infinitely wiſe LAW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GIVER, for the government of his choſen people, by their brethren, who were trained up among them, and to prevent foreigners having any ſhare in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, cannot fail to throw light on this ſubject. He expreſsly commanded:
<q>Thou ſhalt in any wiſe ſet him king over thee, whom the LORD thy GOD ſhall chooſe: one from among thy brethren ſhalt thou ſet king over thee: thou mayeſt not ſet a ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over thee, who is not thy brother</q>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Deut. 17.15.</note>. The principal reaſons of this precept were, no doubt, That their king might always be a perſon united and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with his ſubjects, by all the bonds of nature, religion, and friendſhip: That his intereſts and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs might be inſeperably connected with the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts and happineſs of his ſubjects:—That from love to his country, to the religion and laws of it, and from a natural regard to his ſubjects, as brethren, he might rule for the general good:—That he might maintain and promote the true religion, ſway the ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013049_0008_0F8FF644D01078F8"/>
in righteouſneſs, with gentleneſs and brotherly kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, towards all his ſubjects.</p>
            <p>THE alwiſe and perfect GOVERNOR determined that ſuch a perſon would be moſt likely to anſwer the great ends of government: And that the conſtituting of ſuch a perſon to rule and govern had the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt tendency to promote the common weal, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the privileges of his choſen people entire to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture times.</p>
            <p>HE ſaw that the introduction of a foreigner would have a tendency directly the reverſe. Therefore the Jewiſh Monarch might be no ſtranger, no uſurper, but a native Jew, elected according to divine appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by the general conſent and ſuffrages of his brethren, whom he was to govern.</p>
            <p>MOREOVER, the SUPREME LAWGIVER taught his people, That their Prince ſhould be a man of truth, "hating covetouſneſs," of known and approved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, "juſt ruling in the fear of God"<note n="*" place="bottom">Exod. 18.21. 2 Sam. 23.3.</note>. He was prohibited to multiply horſes or chariots, or greatly to hoard up ſilver and gold <note n="§" place="bottom">Deut. 17.16, 17.</note>. GOD ſaw that this would have a tendency to lift up his heart in pride, make him independent of his ſubjects, and put it in his hands to oppreſs and tyrannize over them.</p>
            <p>FROM this view of the conſtitution of the Jewiſh KING, by the SUPREME LAWGIVER, it is moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that He viewed it as a matter of great and high importance that thoſe who bear rule over others, ſhould be their brethren, born among them; bound by all the ties of nature, friendſhip, intereſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to rule in righteouſneſs: and to maintain, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, and perpetuate the privileges, immunities, and happineſs of their ſubjects. This He judged to have the moſt happy tendency to promote and ſubſerve theſe noble ends. Nor could he think the privileges and happineſs of his people ſecure under the government
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:013049_0009_0F8FF645929A9A90"/>
of my foreigner or uſurper. Therefore He expreſsly forbiddeth the appointment of a ſtranger, who was not an Iſraelite, to be their king. He knew, that the bonds of nature, the alliances of friendſhip, that love and fondneſs for their native country, which, in a greater or leſs degree poſſeſs all men, would, in the caſe of foreign princes, all unite their influence, with innumerable attendant circumſtances and conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to render them oppreſſors and tyrants, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce their ſubjects to a ſtate the moſt wretched and miſerable.</p>
            <p>FURTHERMORE the ſame regulations were to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the conſtitution of all ſubordinate officers. It was commanded,
<q>Thou ſhalt provide out of all the people able men, ſuch as fear GOD, men of truth, hating covetouſneſs: and place ſuch over them, to be rulers of thouſands, and rulers of hundreds, ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of fifties, and rulers of tens. And Moſes choſe able men out of all Iſrael and made them heads over the people, rulers of thouſands, &amp;c</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Exod. 18.21, 25.</note>. Moſes ſeemeth to have been firſt directed to this by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Law; but it is evident from ſeveral Parts of the Scripture <note n="‡" place="bottom">Numb. 11.16, 17.</note>, that it was done at the commandment of the LORD, by the general choice and ſuffrage of the people.
<q>Take ye wiſe men and underſtanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you. And ye anſwered me and ſaid, The thing which thou haſt ſpoken, is good for us to do. So I took the chief of your tribes, wiſe men, and known, and made them heads over you, cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains over thouſands, and captains over hundreds, captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes</q>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Deut. 1.13, 14, 15.</note>. Their officers were all to be of themſelves, men of great abilities, known and approved in their ſeveral tribes and cities, as men of real piety, of invincible veracity and integrity,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013049_0010_0F8FF6465BF7CE28"/>
of found wiſdom and real largeneſs of heart: Men who knew what Iſrael ought to do, and who would faithfully purſue the welfare of the people of God.</p>
            <p>FROM this view of the Jewiſh conſtitution, ſo far as it was of a civil nature, it is moſt evident, that ſuch, and ſuch only, were to be appointed to rule over them, from time to time, as were their brethren, acquainted with their genius and character, connected with them by nature, friendſhip, intereſt and religion: and every way ſo circumſtanced, as that they ſhould not only be the beſt able to promote the common good of the people of God; but as that they ſhould be under the influence and conſtraint, of all imaginable engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and motives, to uſe all their abilities, opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and advantages to make them great, religious, and happy.</p>
            <p>FURTHER, as this was an appointment of the SU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PREME LAWGIVER, for the good of that favourite people whoſe GOD and KING He was, it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the appointment of ſuch men to civil rule hath the moſt efficacious tendency to maintain and ſecure the rights of a people, and to tranſmit them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to poſterity:—The nobleſt tendency to make them a well governed, a free, a brave, a great, and flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people.</p>
            <p>ON the other hand, as the choice of a ſtranger is peremptorily forbidden, it is equally certain, that the appointment of foreigners hath directly the oppoſite tendency: and is calculated, at once, to ſtrip a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of every thing dear and valuable, and to reduce them to a ſtate of ſlavery and wretchedneſs.</p>
            <p>THIS ſubject will receive further light, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, That it was threatened as a terrible curſe <note n="§" place="bottom">Deut. 28.43, 44.</note> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Iſrael, that ſtrangers ſhould rule over them: and that it is mentioned as a lamentable caſe indeed, when there were none to lead them among all the ſons whom
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013049_0011_0F8FF6471133E670"/>
they had brought up <note n="‖" place="bottom">Iſaiah 51.18.</note>. On the other hand, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed as a rich bleſſing, That
<q>their nobles ſhould be of themſelves, and that their governour ſhould proceed from the midſt of them</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Jer. 30.21.</note>. But in what reſpects can the one be conſidered as a curſe, or the other as a bleſſing, in any view but this, That the tendency of the one was to make them miſerable, and to deprive them of every thing dear and valuable, and of the other to make them free, proſperous and happy?</p>
            <p>AGAIN, the general thirſt of nations and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to be governed by their own ſons, and their great averſion to rulers of foreign extract demonſtrate the obſervation, I am attempting to illuſtrate, and ſhew it to be agreeable to the common ſenſe and experience of mankind.</p>
            <p>THAT there is a ſtrong and univerſal thirſt in all nations and communities to be governed by their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen and acquaintance, is indiſputably evident from the ſtruggles, which they have univerſally made to ſupport their native princes and rulers, and to expel others. Where is the nation which hath not run to arms, and diſputed this matter at the point of the ſword? How did the ancient nations of the eaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with blood and fire for the privilege of being go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by their native princes? When the Romans began to extend their conqueſts in Italy, and when afterwards they alarmed the European nations with the terrour of their arms, how warmly did the various independent ſtates and nations diſpute this privilege at the expence of their lives and fortunes? When foiled or vanquiſhed in one terrible engagement, how ſoon did they rally again, and with a bravery and heroiſm peculiar to free and independent nations ruſh to new battles? Eſteeming the privilege of being governed by their friends dearer than their treaſures or blood.

Saith a fine modern writer,
<q>Theſe defended their ancient poſſeſſions with obſtinate valour. It was by the ſuperiority of their diſcipline rather than of their courage, that the Romans gained any advantage over them. The vanquiſhed people reſumed their arms with freſh ſpirit and their undiſciplined valour animated by the love of liberty, ſupplied the want of conduct as well as of union</q>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. Robertſon in his hiſtory of Charles V.</note>. How warm and bloody were the ſtruggles of the ancient Britons for theſe privileges when Julius Caeſar <note n="*" place="bottom">Julius Caeſar firſt landed in Britain on the 26th of Auguſt, A. M. 3950, a little more than 54 years before the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Chriſtian Aera. The battles between him and the Britons were very obſtinate and bloody, but the Romans, at laſt, by their ſuperior ſkill and diſcipline obtained the advantage, and got footing on the iſland. They remained here almoſt 500 years; a great part of which time, the Britons were their tributaries. They were, at times, intolerably oppreſſed and moſt barbarouſly treated by the Romans: and at turns, for hundreds of years, they diſputed their liberties with them, with the moſt obſtinate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible valour. In the reign of Nero A. D. 61, Boadicea, a Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Queen, who had been treated with inſufferable inhumanity and outrage, by the Romans, drew together an army of 230000 Britons, to avenge her own, and her country's wrongs. She reduced ſeveral of the principal Roman cities, and put 70 or 80 thouſand Romans to the ſword: But unfortunately engaging Suetonius the Roman general, in a narrow paſs, ſhe was defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with the loſs of 80 thouſand men. The Romans took their final leave of Briton, A. D. 448. Very ſoon after their departure, the Saxons began to tranſport themſelves into Britain, made ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements, and in the fifth and ſixth centuries formed the Hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarchy, or ſeven Saxon kingdoms. They reduced the Britons to a ſtate of ſervitude, and employed them in all manner of drudgeries; particularly in cultivating thoſe very lands, for their foreign maſters, of which they had been the Proprietors. In the beginning of the ninth century Egbert put an end to the Hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarchy, and became the firſt monarch of all England. The Danes began their Ravages in Britain about the year 832, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them until 1013, when Swane or Swein, King of Denmark, made an entire conqueſt of England, and was acknowledged as king. He died the next year, Feb. 3, 1014, after he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed the nation beyond all deſcription. Speed, ſpeaking of this time, hath this emphatical expreſſion: "Theſe were the days of England's mourning." His Son, Canute the great, was afterwards made king, and the Daniſh Government continued for three ſhort reigns compriſing in the whole about 29 years.</note> made his diſcent upon the Britiſh Iſland?—And afterwards, with the Saxons, Danes and Normans? How bravely did the Barons of England take up arms in the Reigns of King John, and of Henry the III, to drive foreigners from the courts of the nation, and to fill the ſeats of Juſtice with their acquaintance and free-born ſons? But what can be the language of all theſe bloody ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, of this univerſal thirſt of nations to be governed by their own children, but this, That the government of ſtates and nations, by their own ſons and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, hath the happieſt tendency to maintain and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate their privileges: and that the introduction of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013049_0013_0F8FF648CEC1C560"/>
foreigners to civil government hath the moſt efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tendency, to ſubvert their conſtitution, to enſlave and make them miſerable? This then is agreeable to the univerſal ſenſe and experience of mankind. Theſe are ſentiments written not in letters of gold, but in the far more expreſſive characters of Human BLOOD.</p>
            <p>FURTHERMORE, the hiſtory of ancient, as well as of later ages will reflect light upon this ſubject. No ſooner did foreigners poſſeſs themſelves of civil Rule in Egypt, than the ancient inhabitants, Egyptians, as well as Hebrews, loſt their former freedom and ſunk into a ſtate of ſlavery and wretchedneſs hardly to be deſcribed. To ſhew inſtances of the like nature, in moſt of the eaſtern, as well as of the European na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, would not be hard or difficult. But our own nation will furniſh us with ſo many affecting inſtances of this nature, that we need not ſearch for them in foreign countries. To mention a few; How intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable were the ſufferings, abuſes and oppreſſions of the ancient Britons, at turns, under the Roman govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and eſpecially under the Government of the Saxons and Danes? What uneaſineſs, univerſal diſcontent and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013049_0014_0F8FF64950190090"/>
miſery did the introduction of foreigners to civil rule breed in the nation, in the reign of EDWARD the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor? Foreigners occupied all the great places of truſt and importance in the kingdom, whether civil or religious. Saith a modern writer,
<q>The Normans intercepted all the rays of regal favours, and baſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſplendours, which were cauſed by the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence and revenues of the Engliſh.</q>
Their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious counſels and influence, had, more than once, well nigh plunged the nation in all the calamities and horrours of a civil war.</p>
            <p>THE dreadful effects of the government of foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, were ſtill more terribly felt in the reign of WIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIAM the Conqueror. Though he took the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn oaths, and ſwore upon the relicks of the dead, to confirm to the nation all their ancient privileges, and to govern them by the laws of the land, yet, how were the ancient inhabitants, without the leaſt colour of law or juſtice, deprived both of their lives and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes? By him the native inhabitants were almoſt univerſally deprived of every place of honour and truſt, and Normans in every part of the kingdom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced to civil rule, who paid little regard to law or juſtice, and practiſed almoſt every ſpecies of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and tyranny. Inferior officers treated the Engliſh gentry and nobility with inſolence, loaded the people with grievous exactions, and, in time of peace, plundered their houſes, and raviſhed their women, even with a ſavage and brutal wantonneſs. And what is ſtill worſe, this ſcene of violence, outrage, and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, which nothing but cruelty could countenance, nothing but the moſt barbarous ſavageneſs could to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate, was connived at, if not favoured by the guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of the realm.

and WILLIAM, inſtead of redreſſing their wrongs, waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the country with fire and ſword. The lands and arms of the Natives were taken from them, their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and churches conſumed with fire, and even the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of huſbandry were wreſted from their hands. Some parts of the country, for ſixty miles together, became a perfect waſte and deſart, for many years. All the horrors of a dreadful famine ſucceded this more than human wantonneſs of cruelty and rage. Not leſs than an hundred thouſand ſouls are ſuppoſed to have periſhed for want of the neceſſaries of life. Parents and children raving with hunger, expired in the arms of each other, and lay all about the country rotting above ground, and having none to bury them <note n="‖" place="bottom">Rid. Vol. 5. P. 24, 25.</note>. The Nobles and friends of the nation, who ſurvived the dreadful cataſtrophe, were obliged, almoſt to a man, to abandon every dear intereſt and enjoyment in their native land, and to ſeek refuge in foreign Courts: while out-landiſh monſters licked up all the wealth and engroſſed all the honours of the nation. This ſcene of diſtreſs and horror laſted for years: nor is there the leaſt intimation that WILLIAM ever felt any relentings for his wretched ſubjects, or took a ſingle ſtep to relieve the ſtarving inhabitants. Could this have been expected from a native Prince? Was the conduct of WILLIAM like this towards his own countrymen? By no means. While he appeared not only deſtitute of all juſtice, but of all humanity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Britons, he loaded them with every royal favour <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>William the Conqueror, ſometimes called William the Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard, was the Baſe-born ſon of Robert, Duke of Normandy, a large and fruitful Province of France, about 200 miles in length, and 100 in breadth. The Normans and Danes made a conqueſt of this country about the year 912 under one Rollo whom they created their firſt Duke. William, their ſeventh Duke, was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Saxon or Daniſh Royal Blood, not doth it appear that he had any juſt claim to the Britiſh Crown. However, having aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled a numerous army he landed in England, near Haſtings in Suffex, Sept. 28, 1066; where, on the 14th of October, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to an engagement with Harold II, Son of the popular Earl Godwin, who had been lately elected King of England, after an obſtinate and bloody battle, fought on both ſides with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reſolution and moſt unremitting ardour, from ſeven in the morning until in the Night, he obtained a compleat victory. Harold the Britiſh King with about 70000 of his men fell in the battle.</p>
                  <p>William was proclaimed King of England, and reigned almoſt 21 years. He governed without any regard to his Oaths, or to the ancient Laws and cuſtoms of the Nation: introduced the Norman cuſtoms and language, and all pleadings at the bar were in French. He treated the Engliſh with great inhumanity, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the hands and feet of many thouſands of the people, and deſtroying all the North of England with fire and ſword. Not leſs than 200000 Souls ſeem either to have been put to the ſword, to have been ſtarved, or ſome how or other to have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by him, from the time of his invading England to his Demiſe, Sept. 9, 1087. He gave all the lands of the ancient inhabitants to the Normans, ſo that at his death there was not an Engliſh Gentlemen in the whole nation who poſſeſſed an eſtate in his own Right.</p>

To what diſtreſs and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity did foreigners, foreign counſels, and influence reduce it in the reign of King JOHN, and in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding reign of HENRY the III? Eſpecially, the reign of the latter is ſtrongly marked with the bale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful conſequences of the government and influence of foreigners, who were the Prime Miniſters and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of this miſguided, baſe and unhappy Prince.</p>
            <p>BUT to paſs over other inſtances of ſuch as have, in the moſt large and ſtrict ſenſe, been foreigners, how terrible have been the conſequences of Governors from abroad, who have been independent of the people, to the New-England Colonies, and to the neighbouring Provinces? How did New-England groan under the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:013049_0017_0F8FF64D1F3B3958"/>
intolerable tyranny and injuſtice of Sir Edmund An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dros and his creatures? How inſufferable were the grievances of New-Jerſey under the deſpotic admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Lord Cornby? How perplexing, how ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, how pernicious, and almoſt perpetual have been the diſputes of the Governors of the Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts and of New-York with their reſpective Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies? How are governours, who are not natives of the country, and who are independent of the people whom they govern, haraſſing and plaguing their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Aſſemblies, with prorogations, diſſolutions, and almoſt every low-lived artifice, to worry them into meaſures fatal to the liberties and happineſs of their Conſtituents? On the other hand, what uninterrupted peace and tranquility, what a ſteady and faithful ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of juſtice, for a long ſucceſſion of years, do Colonies enjoy, which are governed by their own ſons, elected by the free ſuffrages of their conſtituents?</p>
            <p>ONCE MORE, the proviſion long ſince made in our nation, that every man ſhould be judged by twelve jurors of the neighbourhood, in all caſes of property, as well as of Life and Death, and that every man ſhould be judged by his peers, may ſerve further to illuſtrate the point in hand.</p>
            <p>THE appointment of Juries, in the Britiſh nation ſeemeth to have been as early as the reign of ALFRED THE GREAT, about the cloſe of the ninth century. So vigilant was that excellent prince againſt the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringment of this noble inſtitution, that he hanged one of his judges for ſentencing a man to death without the aſſent of the twelve jurors. The right of trials by juries hath been eſteemed as a privilege of ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable worth, and as the very bulwark of Britiſh Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, for many hundred years. The nation, at turns, contended for this privilege at the point of the ſword, until the grant of MAGNA CHARTA, by King JOHN about the commencement of the thirteenth centu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry <note n="*" place="bottom">The firſt Magna Charta was granted June 15, A. D. 1215. The preſent Magna Charta, which is, in ſome things, different from the former, was granted in the ninth year of the reign of Henry III. A. D. 1224.</note>.
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:013049_0018_0F8FF64DD1D13BC8"/>
By this the privilege of trials by peers and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries was put upon a more firm and permanent foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. In this Britons glory and think themſelves hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py above any other nation. But wherein lieth the mighty advantage, unleſs it be in this, That it ſecureth to every man a judgment by his countrymen and neighbours; in which, he may expect all the favour and protection, which his character and circumſtances in life, and which the laws of his country will juſtly admit; and is delivered from the intrigues and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial determinations of foreigners: with whom his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and manner of life would have little or no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, to whom the laws of his country might be leſs known, and by whom they might be far leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded?</p>
            <p>LASTLY, this point may receive ſtill further light, from a conſideration of the eſteem, veneration, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections and friendſhips, which men contract for their native country, and from a conſideration of the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of ſuch friendſhips and connections.</p>
            <p>SUCH is human nature, that every man hath a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar regard for his own nation and country. All men ſeem to glory in the riches, valour, honour, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terary accompliſhments, and various excellencies of their own country and nation. They feel themſelves ſenſibly intereſted in their welfare, and it is not eaſily that ſuch a regard for their native land is obliterated, and the influence of it deſtroyed. They conſider it as the nation to which they are related by the ties of blood, as the country which gave them birth and nurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their tender years. It is the country which hath extended to them the breaſts of ſcience, and enlightened their eyes with the knowledge of men and things. It
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:013049_0019_0F8FF64E919DC400"/>
is the country of their forefathers, which hath libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally poured it's favours on them and on their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. It is the country under whoſe laws and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, the religion, lives, fortunes, and every thing dear to their anceſtors or to themſelves, have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected and defended. It is the country in the defence of which they have expended both their treaſures and their blood. To the religion, to the laws, cuſtoms, and manners of it they have been trained from the tender years of Infancy. For them, by long uſe, they have contracted a particular regard and veneration. Here are the companions, the guides and protectors of their youth. Here are their neighbours, their friends, their honours, and all their great Intereſts. Here are the people from whom they expect prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: The people for whoſe counſel, eſteem, and friendſhip, above all others they have a particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, and to whoſe intereſts and ſervice they are moſt ready to be devoted. Here are the Graves and Bones of their Fathers; here they expect to leave their own, with all their friends and dear enjoyments on this ſide Heaven. Beſides, if they are exalted to the ſeats of Legiſlature or of Judgment, in a free ſtate, the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem friendſhip and ſuffrages of their neighbours have fixed them in thoſe places of honour and truſt. The friendſhip of their conſtituents, the confidence they place in their abilities, their dependance on their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and faithfulneſs, the public manifeſtations of honour and eſteem given them, cannot fail to influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence noble minds, to conciliate favour and engage fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity. Therefore all the ties of nature, of friendſhip, of honour, of intereſt, of gratitude and religion, unite their influence, and bind them to purſue the common good of their native country, the welfare of the great whole over which they preſide, and with which they are ſpecially connected. When they act as Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, or ſet on the Bench to determine cauſes civil or criminal, theſe all operate to produce LAWS the moſt
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:013049_0020_0F8FF64F5CD295F8"/>
wiſe and ſalutary, and JUDGMENT the moſt righteous and impartial. If they enact Laws for the ſtate in general, or lift their hands to impoſe taxes, they at the ſame time make laws for their neighbours, for their friends, for their children and for themſelves: They impoſe no burden upon others, but what at the ſame time they lay, not only upon their neareſt friends, but even upon themſelves. Every motive, therefore, unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it's influence, and operateth with its whole force to ſecure and promote the intereſt of the GREAT WHOLE.</p>
            <p>If we view them on the Bench, it is their country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, their neighbour, as well as fellow-creature, whom they are about to judge. Their neighbour and their country both ſhare in their affections: they would injure neither, but do juſtice to both. They are all attention to evidence, to law and equity, and every thing is ſo circumſtanced, as to effect a righteous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, ſo far as it can be in this imperfect ſtate.</p>
            <p>BESIDE, men educated in a country, muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, (caeteris paribus,) to have a much better know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the laws, cuſtoms, manners, genius and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the people, than any other man can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have. A thorough knowledge of theſe is of great importance in a Ruler. A man can hardly govern a family in any tolerable manner, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting the intereſt, genius, and manners of it. Much leſs can a common wealth or kingdom be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without the knowledge of them. But ſome of theſe are to be learned, rather by acquaintance, obſervation, and experience, than by reading or ſtudy.</p>
            <p>THESE conſiderations therefore, at once, ſhew us, in a ſtriking point of light, that the government of a people by their free-born ſons hath the happieſt tendency to maintain and perpetuate all their valuable rights and privileges.</p>
            <p>ON the other hand, all theſe things, in the caſe of a foreigner, or of one who is independent of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whom he governeth, and wholly dependent on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:013049_0021_0F8FF65016789BF8"/>
unite their influence to make him a tyrant, to render his government intolerable, and to make the people ſervile and wretched.</p>
            <p>SUCH Rulers are blinded by the foreign ſupport and honours they receive, by the foreign friendſhips and connections, which they have made, by the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al regard they have imbibed for their native land, and they are, by theſe, as it were bribed and bought off from the intereſts of the people whom they go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern. They by no means view things impartially: and it is but an ill chance, which people have of being governed in a mild and righteous manner, or of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their conduct and grievances fairly repreſented to courts abroad, on whom they are dependent, and whom to deceive it is but too often their great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</p>
            <p>IT may be well obſerved here, That if rulers are made independent of the people whom they govern<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and wholly dependent on others, in a diſtant country, if their connections, friendſhips, and intereſts are there, the effects will be much the ſame, as in the caſe of a foreigner in the largeſt ſenſe. The circumſtance of their being born within the empire, in ſome other country, many thouſand miles diſtant from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple over whom they bear rule, will not greatly help the matter. The circumſtances and cauſes being near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſame, the effects will be ſimilar.</p>
            <p>THE miſrepreſentations which have been made of the American Colonies, at the Court of GREAT BRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAIN, and the great partiality with which the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans have been treated, in the late ſtruggles for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, will evince the truth of theſe obſervations. How have diſorders merely trifling, in America, been magnified and ſwelled into high Treaſon, by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial repreſentations of ſuch rulers and their baſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions? How have the diſturbances of a few children or imprudent ſallies of a young rabble, which a grand juror or common conſtable might have ſtilled, and a
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:013049_0022_0F8FF650FA8CA5C0"/>
common juſtice of the peace have ſeverely puniſhed, been magnified into open rebellion, become matters of ſerious concern and deliberation in the Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of a great Nation? Britiſh ſleets have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed a thouſand leagues, and troops collected from various parts of the globe to curb and chaſtiſe the rebels.</p>
            <p>IS not all this done without giving the party accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, though whole towns, yea whole communities of people, the leaſt hearing or trial? How unlike to this is the treatment which Britons receive in the Parent State? Do not ſuch riots and mobs as Americans ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw, and even inſults of Majeſty itſelf, paſs often there unnoticed by adminiſtration? Not a ſlave can be puniſhed there, but upon a verdict of twelve jurors of the neighbourhood, on a fair trial. But alas! Are not Americans, at the diſtance of three thouſand miles, in effect, condemned unheard and treated as rebels? If Americans are ſuppoſed to be guilty of a miſdemean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our towards the Parent State, are not their towns in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with ſhips of War, and muſt not examination of the matter be had under the mouths of cannon, and before the points of ſword and bayonet? If under theſe diſtreſsful circumſtances, any grounds of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs can be found, is it not ordered that the ſuppoſed criminal ſhall be dragged acroſs the Atlantic, be at the expenſe of tranſporting evidences to GREAT BRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAIN, and undergo a trial, even for life before ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers? What a wretched chance indeed hath a man for his life, though ever ſo innocent, in circumſtances like theſe! On the moſt favourable ſuppoſition that he is at laſt acquitted, he and his family are reduced to beggary: to be ſure unleſs his fortune be more affluent than Americans can commonly boaſt. At any rate, condemned or acquitted, he is undone. Are Britons thus uſed in the Parent State? Would they brook ſuch treatment as this?—Yet alas! is not all this right and conſtitutional with regard to their Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican brethren?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:013049_0023_0F8FF651929DA3E8"/>FURTHER, it may be obſerved, that when a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are governed by their own country men, choſen by the ſuffrages of the free-men whom they govern, they are ordinarily ſome of the moſt able, religious, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men in the land, and they will be careful to fill the places of all inferior officers, with men of good abilities, and of good lives.</p>
            <p>BUT on the other hand, when this is not the caſe, they are but too often of an ill character: either the dependents of the great, ſhifted off to governments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, to eaſe them of the trouble of their ſupport; or they are reduced Officers, exalted to government to get a piece of bread and advance their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. Men too often trained to vice, ſkilful in butchering the Human Species, deſtitute of the tender feelings of the human heart, maſters of intrigue and corruption, as unpractiſed in virtue as they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to vice, as untaught to govern, as they are artful at intrigue and corruption. Too often are they children in abilities to thoſe they govern: men whom the ſuffrages of a religious and free people would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver advance to the loweſt office in a ſtate: and through their influence men of the like character are introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all places of inferior truſt. When this is the caſe, how dreadful are the conſequences? The chief rulers are the great examples and patterns of vice and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. While they are in power the people mourn: they ſcorn and hate them, they can place no confidence in their abilities or in their integrity; nor can they with any pleaſure ſubmit to their authority; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every thing contributeth its influence, to make the government unhappy, and the people ſervile and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable. And what maketh the caſe ſtill more deplor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, is, That if by oppreſſion and injuſtice, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are provoked to unwarrantable and ſeditious mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, inſtead of redreſſing their grievances, and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſpirits, by the impartial adminiſtration of juſtice, the ſword is drawn againſt them, and they are
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:013049_0024_0F8FF6541DC53F10"/>
butchered by hundreds, with the ſame fierceneſs and barbarity, with which men trained to revenge, ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and blood, deſtroy their moſt implacable enemies.</p>
            <p>BUT in colonies governed by their native rulers, no ſuch inſurrections are raiſed, no ſuch bloody ſcenes are perpetrated. The people love and venerate their ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. They are their friends and neighbours, known and approved among them, for ability, integrity, juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and mercy, The people rejoice in their honours, venerate their counſels, and ſubmit with cheerfulneſs to their authority. The rulers and the ruled ſeek the honour and happineſs of each other, and mutually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in the common weal.</p>
            <p>THUS we have clear and ſtriking evidence, That the government of a people by their own country-men and neighbours, choſen by common conſent, hath the happieſt tendency to ſecure and perpetuate the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, freedom and happineſs or communities; and that the introduction of foreigners, or of perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of the people whom they govern, is calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, at once, to ſtrip them of every valuable enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to render them ſervile and miſerable.</p>
            <p>IT will be neceſſary, before I improve the ſubject, juſt to obſerve, That when perſons become entirely naturali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, &amp; have fixed their intereſts, connections, alliances, &amp; friendſhips in a country, and become equally connected with it, and dependent upon it, with the natives them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; as is often the caſe, they are no more to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as foreigners: and it is far from the deſign of this diſcourſe to maintain or inſinuate, that they may not, with the ſame ſafety, as any other men whatſoever, be choſen into places or truſt, if in other reſpects they are equally qualified. Where a man was rocked in his cradle, whether north or ſouth of the Tweed, whether in Europe or America it matters not, if he have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per qualifications for government.</p>
            <p>AGAIN it may be obſerved, That it will be an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of little weight, againſt the preceding reaſoning.
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:013049_0025_0F8FF6555D3FEE28"/>
That foreigners have ſome times governed well: For there can be no juſt arguing from particulars to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, from extraordinary and exempt caſes, to what may generally be expected.</p>
            <p>THE ſentiments before us naturally furniſh us with this remark: That the people of CONNECTICUT enjoy the greateſt FREEDOM and PRIVILEGES, and are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly and ſingularly HAPPY.</p>
            <p>IF to be governed by their own conſent, by their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſons, choſen by their free ſuffrages, if to enjoy the moſt happy form of civil government, can make a people free; if theſe things have the greateſt tendency to make them brave, proſperous and happy, and to perpetuate every dear enjoyment, then great indeed is the FREEDOM, great the PRIVILEGES and HAPPINESS of this COLONY. Such FREEDOM, ſuch PRIVILEGES, ſuch HAPPINESS, through the good providence of GOD, we amply enjoy. That great Bleſſing promiſed to Iſrael, That their NOBLES ſhould be of themſelves, and that their GOVERNOUR ſhould proceed from the midſt of them <note n="‖" place="bottom">Jer. 30.21.</note>, is vouchſafed unto us. Our Rulers are our country-men, our neighbours and friends. They love our country, as the place of their birth and educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is the country of their friends and brethren; to which they are united by all the alliances of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and of blood; with which they have formed a thouſand tender and powerful connections. Their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts are inſeperably connected with our own. They are not only members of our civil, but of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious communities: members of our churches, bound by baptiſm, by a perſonal profeſſion of CHRISTIANI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY, by ſacramental vows, and the moſt ſacred engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to GOD and men, to ſeek their good, and the general good of their fellow men. They are bound by all the bands of nature, friendſhip, honour, intereſt and religion, to promote the public Weal. They are "a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men," intimately acquainted with the laws, cuſtoms,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:013049_0026_0F8FF6565BDB83F8"/>
manners, genius and great intereſts of the people. They love our country, our churches, and our religion. Their experience, ſuperior wiſdom and penetration have compiled for us a moſt excellent ſyſtem of LAWS, founded on the great principles of liberty, juſtice, and religion. Their government is mild and righteous: and as they do not govern to get their bread and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance their fortunes, at the ruin of ours, and as they can lay no burdens on us, without bearing the ſame weight themſelves, their government is as remarkable for the little expence of it, as it is for it's gentleneſs, impartiality and righteouſneſs. All our expences, by way of ſalary <note n="‖" place="bottom">The whole amount of the ſalaries paid annually by the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is only £. 580. The Salary of the Governor is £. 300, of the Deputy Governour £. 100, of the Secretary £. 20, and of the Treaſurer £ 160. The Judges of the Superior Court have no ſalary from the government. The Chief Judge is allowed 18 ſhillings per day, and the four ſide Judges have 17 ſhillings each per day. This court is obliged by law, to ſet 14 weeks annually, and commonly ſetteth, by adjournment, much longer, and the coſt of it is about £. 600 per annum. The expence of it for three years and a half paſt, upon a careful examination, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be about £. 2100, juſt £. 600 per annum. The avails of it, together with the forfeitures, for the ſame term, with proper allowances for ſuch as may not be recovered, amount to £. 2200: So that the Superior Court is of no coſt, at preſent, to the Colony, conſidered as a Government. In ſhort the whole expence of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in Connecticut is trifling. The coſt of the General Aſſembly annually is about £. 1500. A rate of one penny on the pound, on the Grand Liſt, which raiſeth about £. 6000 per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, near the one half of which is annually taken out of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury for Schooling, hath of late years been ſufficient to defray all our publick charges as a Government.</note> to civil officers, do not, I imagine, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount annually, by conſiderable, to the one half of the ſalary of a king's governour, in any of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Provinces. Our lives and fortunes, all our privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges civil and religious are in a very happy manner ſecured.</p>
            <p>WE have the greateſt religious, as well as civil pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges. We enjoy liberty of conſcience in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleateſt ſenſe. No man is perſecuted for his religion:
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:013049_0027_0F8FF656D16D1328"/>
we all enjoy our Bibles, may read and think for our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Happy indeed would it be, did we read them more, underſtand them better, and build our faith and practice more entirely on the excellent doctrines and maxims which they preſcribe.</p>
            <p>THE Goſpel is preached among us with light and power. We enjoy our Sabbaths and all goſpel or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and privileges. Happy indeed ſhall we be if we "receive not" this "GRACE of GOD in vain."</p>
            <p>BESIDES, we have a good land like Canaan of old, a land flowing with milk and honey; in which we may eat bread to the full,
<q>whoſe ſtones are iron and out of whoſe hills thou mayeſt dig braſs.</q>
It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a land under good advantages for a ſea-trade; ſo that we may
<q>ſuck of the abundance of the ſeas and of treaſures hid in the ſand. The lines are fallen unto</q>
us "in pleaſant places: yea" we
<q>have a goodly he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage.</q>
            </p>
            <p>WHILE therefore we conſider how great are our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges and enjoyments, and from whom they are all derived, can we but reflect, How great are our obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the moſt grateful ſentiments, even on the bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed knees of our hearts, to offer our devouteſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments of praiſe and thankſgiving to GOD, the great author and giver of them? And that theſe ſtreams of his beneficence and mercy ſhould lead us to him, and engage us conſtantly, and forever in his ſervice?</p>
            <p>YEA, can we but reflect again, That our ſin and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude will be great indeed, moſt inexcuſable and abominable, if under all theſe privileges and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges we continue in ſin, and do not become, in very deed, an obedient and holy people?—That as we are exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to Heaven, in point of privileges, ſo we ſhall be caſt down even to the loweſt Hell, if we abuſe and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>improve them?—That it will
<q>be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah, in the day of Judgment <note n="*" place="bottom">Luke 10.15.</note>,</q>
than for us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:013049_0028_0F8FF657A5EF8C40"/>ANOTHER thought which the preceeding ſentiments ſuggeſt, is this, That all poſſible care, and every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per meaſure, ſhould be taken to prevent foreigners, and all others, who are independent of a people, from hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any part in government, and to keep civil rulers, as much as poſſible dependent on the people whom they govern, and intimately connected with them.</p>
            <p>NOT only the repreſentations made, and horrible deeds related in this diſcourſe, but the hiſtory of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ages will teach us, that nothing can be more fatal to the civil rights and happineſs of a people than the government of ſtrangers, and of rulers independent of the people whom they govern. When the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a ſtate is put into the hands of men unconnect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them, unſupported by them, whoſe intimate friends and ſpecial connections, are in a different coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and who receive ample ſupport from another quarter, they may well expect oppreſſion, injuſtice, the loſs of liberty, and almoſt every civil miſchief. As this becometh the caſe with America, or with her ſeveral provinces and governments, may not SHE, and THEY expect to bid farewel to that liberty, to thoſe happy times and days, which we and our fathers have ſeen? As things are verging towards this, are not our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, by little and little, crumbling away, and is not our happineſs drawing to a cloſe?</p>
            <p>EVERY free ſtate therefore ſhould maintain a moſt vigilant care and guard againſt foreign, or independent rulers, and againſt all ſuch meaſures as are calculated to introduce them, and impoſe them upon a people. The very firſt ſtep this way, ought thoroughly to rouſe, thoroughly to alarm them.</p>
            <p>IT ſhould alſo be the particular care of every civil community to keep their rulers as much as poſſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on them, and intimately connected with them. For this purpoſe it will be highly politic, in every free ſtate, to keep property as equally divided among the inhabitants as poſſible, and not to ſuffer a few perſons
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:013049_0029_0F8FF6585139ED68"/>
to amaſs all the riches and wealth of a country: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to have a ſpecial care how they adopt any laws, cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, or precedents, which have a tendency this way. For when men become poſſeſſors of the Wealth of a ſtate, it will be in their power to purchaſe, or by undue influence, which, in ſuch circumſtances, they may have ways almoſt innumerable, to thruſt themſelves into all places of honour and truſt. This will put it in their power, by fraud or force to keep themſelves in thoſe important poſts, and to oppreſs and tyrannize over their fellow men. It will teach the people to look up to them, as to lords and maſters, make them ſervile, and by little and little it will deſpoil them of all true liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and freedom. But on the other hand, the keeping of property, as equally divided as poſſible among a people, will make elections more free, the rulers more dependent, and the liberty and privileges of the ruled vaſtly more ſecure.</p>
            <p>FURTHERMORE, will not our ſubject direct us to this enquiry, Whether the erecting of Courts, and the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of civil rulers independent of the people, whom they reſpect and govern, are not inconſiſtent with the original great deſign of Government, inconſiſtent with the great and unchangeable RULES of RIGHTEOUSNESS, and incompatible with the important RIGHTS, which GOD and Nature have given, in common, to mankind?</p>
            <p>Is it not the dictate of reaſon and of the will of GOD, That the original great deſign of civil Government is the good of the community? The maintaining and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the rights, liberties, privileges and immunities of mankind? The impartial and faithful adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of juſtice? Muſt not whatſoever therefore, tendeth to deprive mankind of theſe important rights, and to prevent the impartial adminiſtration of juſtice, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the great deſign of government, and ſubverſive of it's noble inſtitution? But is not this the caſe, when rulers are made wholly independent of the people, when ſtrangers unconnected with them, and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="32"

of them, are appointed to rule over them? Is not this calculated to deprive a people of liberty and juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; —to render life, property, and every dear enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment very precarious; and to reduce them to a ſtate of ſlavery and miſery, inſtead of making them free and happy? Is it not an infraction of the great and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable LAWS of Nature, Reaſon, and Religion?— Incompatible with the eſſential rights of mankind? How inconſiſtent is this with the conſtitution of the SUPREME LAWGIVER for the good of his choſen peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? Did he not command, That all their rulers ſhould be dependent upon their brethren and moſt intimately connected with them? HE ſaid alſo,
<q>Thou ſhalt take no gift; for the gift blindeth the wiſe, and pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Words of the righteous<note n="*" place="bottom">Exod. 23.8.</note>.</q>
But if any gift tendeth to pervert judgment, if ſo ſmall a gift as one neighbour may ordinarily beſtow on another, is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtone in the eyes, will not hundreds or thouſands ſterling much more have this tendency? Will not ſuch ſhowers of gold and ſilver overwhelm reaſon, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the judgment, and prove not only a ſtone in the eyes, but even render them totally dark and blind? Have not Courts and civil rulers conſtituted, in a manner, wholly independent of the people, ever been the public fountains of oppreſſion and injuſtice? Have they not, inſtead of defending the lives and liberties of mankind, wantonly deprived them of both? And can this be more conſiſtent with the Britiſh conſtitution and the rights of Engliſhmen, than <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the laws of juſtice, and with the unalienable rights of mankind in general? Have not Britons and Americans too, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this, as a privilege, which they might all claim, To be judged by their countrymen and neighbours, who were intimately connected with them, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on them?

Or is the conſtitution of courts and rulers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of the people, and the granting them large penſions or ſalaries from abroad, a flagrant violation of the eſſential right of Britiſh ſubjects?</p>
            <p>OUR ſubject will further inſtruct us what men we ought, this day, to elect into places of civil truſt; "Able men," men of truly great and noble minds, poſſeſſed of reſolution, courage, conſtancy, and firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; excellent preſervatives againſt partiality and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, to which men of little minds, narrow and contracted ſouls, are eaſily ſwayed, by threats, fears, hopes or gifts.

theſe you have already received the thanks of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants; and, on the ſame account, in the name of my reverend fathers and brethren, in the miniſtry, I return you publick thanks: and aſſure you, that we ſhall cheerfully contribute what in us lieth, to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, ſupport and aſſiſt you, in carrying into execution whatſoever may be neceſſary for the peace, order and happineſs of this town, and of the ſeveral parts of it. Theſe public teſtimonials of a general approbation of your conduct, we perſuade ourſelves, will encourage you with unwearied diligence, unremitting zeal and ardour, to perſevere in every ſalutary meaſure you have taken for the publick good, and that they will afford an argument, of no little weight, with you, to go into a prudent and vigorous exertion of all your authority, abilities and influence, to ſuppreſs all kind of vice, immorality and diſorder, and to promote order, virtue, and religion. You cannot be inſenſible, that this will have a charming aſpect upon ſociety, that the happy effects and conſequences of it may, through the bleſſing of GOD, not only be felt by the preſent gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but extend themſelves to ages unborn, yea, to all eternity. Good government and religion have a favourable aſpect not only upon the preſent, but future Times. No more can you be inſenſible, That it is the duty, and an important branch of the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of civil rulers, That they bear not the civil
<q>ſword in vain,</q>
that they be "miniſters of GOD"<note n="‡" place="bottom">Rom. 13.4.</note>, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengers "to execute wrath upon him that doth evil," and that they be miniſters "of GOD for good." This, certainly, is a character, which GOD and men may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably expect you will well ſupport. All the ſacred bands of religion, and the ſolemnities of OATHS are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, and plead for the faithful diſcharge of your important truſt. The temporal and eternal welfare of your neighbours, of your brethren, and of your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; the good of this town and government, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:013049_0034_0F8FF65E6F8C7858"/>
with all the tender and efficacious endearments, by which you are bound to us and to your native land, plead for it with a united force and energy. Unite then, in a vigorous exertion of all your powers, to ſtem the torrent of vice, which is rolling in upon us: To ſuppreſs and puniſh idleneſs, tavern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haunting, ſwearing, lying, intemperance, debauchery, unrighteouſneſs and injuſtice; profanation of the LORD's-DAY, and every other ſpecies of vice, which may be cognizable by law, and fall within your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. Exert yourſelves with true zeal and patriotiſm for the general good. Let all the intereſts of your country and nation, eſpecially the intereſts of this TOWN, the great intereſts of our COLLEGE, and of this COMMON-WEALTH, be ever dear to you. Particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, may they be dear to, ſpecially cared for and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by, the GENTLEMEN, who ſhall now be elected, to repreſent us in the General Aſſembly of this Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. We imagine the publick teſtimonials we ſhall give you of our friendſhip and eſteem, of our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in your abilities, integrity and faithfulneſs, will, with an efficacious energy perſuade and engage you moſt laboriouſly and faithfully to promote our great inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts. You will not fail to conſider you are acting for the country which gave you birth, and for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who have nurſed and protected your tender years: The country which your fathers have purchaſed and defended at a vaſt expence both of treaſure and blood: That you are acting for the community where you have been trained to ſcience, and formed to think, and act great and noble things; and to which, under GOD, you owe all your honours, privileges and immunities both civiland religious:—That you are acting for your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, your friends, yea, your brethren, not barely by the ties of nature, but by the more ſacred bonds of our COMMON CHRISTIANITY:—That if under all theſe ſacred bands and endearments, you betray your truſt, you muſt be perſidious and vile, beyond all deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:013049_0035_0F8FF65F11E204A8"/>
and that your names will deſerve to be handed down to poſterity, loaded with execrations, and ſtrongly mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with eternal infamy and ſhame. You will not fail to reflect, That to act up to your high character, as chriſtians and good rulers, ſerving GOD and your gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration according to his Will, is the higheſt honour and nobleſt happineſs, to which you can aſpire on this ſide Heaven:—That this will give ſurer demonſtrations of the greatneſs of your names, and of the goodneſs of your hearts, and add to them a far greater and more unperiſhing luſtre and glory, than monuments of braſs or marble: That while you faithfully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert yourſelves for the common weal, all good men will rejoice in your honours, and bid you God-ſpeed: —That this will give you the nobleſt comfort and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in life, the ſweeteſt ſupports and moſt glorious proſpects in death:—That this will embalm your names, and hand them down to futurity with honour and applauſe, and that unborn ages will riſe up and pronounce their bleſſings on your memory. Under the influence of theſe GRAND MOTIVES, we perſuade ourſelves you will, by no means, betray our great intereſts, but will act worthy of the honour and truſt we ſhall confer upon you.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude with a word to the freemen of this free and honourable corporation.</p>
            <p>MEN AND BRETHREN,</p>
            <p>WHILE I congratulate you on the account of your great and diſtinguiſhing privileges, and on the return of this joyful anniverſary, which affordeth us an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular demonſtration that we are a free people, you will allow me to remind you, that you are all bound by ſacred bonds and engagements warmly to unite, with our civil rulers, in promoting the welfare of this town, the good of our churches, and of this common-wealth. The ſame ſacred ties, in general,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:013049_0036_0F8FF65FD465A630"/>
which bind them to faithfulneſs, in their ſuperior ſphere of action, lie alſo upon us, and ſhould engage us with united zeal to exert ourſelves, in our ſeveral places and relations, by all proper means, to advance the common happineſs. Let us then feel the weight and influence of them. Let us prize the privileges we enjoy, and be truly thankful for them, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully avoid all thoſe ſins and vices which may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger them, and provoke GOD to take them from us. Let us not only "ceaſe to do evil" but
<q>learn to do well,</q>
to "fear GOD, honour the KING <note n="‖" place="bottom">1 Pet. 2.17.</note>," and cheerfully ſubmit to the laws and authority of the colony. Let us be ſtrict in family religion and government, inculcate on the riſing generation the vaſt neceſſity, high importance, and unſpeakable hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of becoming truly religious:—Teach them to venerate civil authority and government: to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence the ſabbath, houſe, worſhip, and ordinances of GOD. Let us be careful to give them living ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of theſe things in our own conduct. Let us all ſtrive to excel in the practice of righteouſneſs, juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, honeſty, ſobriety, temperance, chaſtity, induſtry, loyalty, frugality, and all the ſocial and chriſtian virtues. Let us act conſcientiouſly in the choice of our civil rulers, with an awful regard to the oath of GOD, which is upon us, knowing, that
<q>when the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule the people mourn<note n="§" place="bottom">Prov. 29.2.</note>.</q> Let love to GOD, and love to men reign in our hearts, and from this higheſt, nobleſt, divineſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, let us ſerve GOD and one another, and
<q>as we have opportunity do good to all men<note n="*" place="bottom">Gal. 6.10.</note>.</q>

            <p>AND may "the LORD bleſs" us and "keep" us; the LORD make his "face ſhine upon" us,<note n="†" place="bottom">Numb. 6.24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 25.</note>
