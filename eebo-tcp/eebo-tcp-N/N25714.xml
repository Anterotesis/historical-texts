            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE following pages are given to the world by a ſon, whoſe filial affection may perhaps have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him to entertain too high an opinion of the merit of his father's productions; but who candid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly owns, his motives to the publication were, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction that the work is calculated to afford conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable amuſement and inſtruction, and a warm de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to reſcue the memory of a father from oblivion.</p>
            <p>Though to all they may not appear in the light in which they do to me, as precious memorials of that wit and poetical genius which once animated the breaſt of him who is now forever laid in the ſilent tomb, and who once was the delight of his friends and family; yet many, I hope, when they read this work, will remember a departed friend, and mourn the loſs of the man while they enjoy the humour of the poet. All I truſt will here find abundant ſubjects of merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and diverſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:034158_0004_0FFC8473D57B5808"/>The author appears to have thoroughly underſtood the true points of ridicule in human characters, and to have drawn them with great accuracy and variety in his comedies. The piece entitled, The Candidates, is intended to laugh to ſcorn the practice of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and falſehood; of which too many are guilty in electioneering; to teach our countrymen to deſpiſe the arts of thoſe who meanly attempt to influence their votes by any thing but merit.—The play of the Patriots is a picture of real and pretended patriots; by which the reader may perceive the difference between them, may learn to honour and reward the true, and to treat the falſe with infamy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. If any conſtruction ſhould be put upon it as a ſatire on the conduct of America in the late re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, the whole tenour of the author's political conduct will exempt him from the imputation of ſuch an intention. He entered warmly into the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the friends of America, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oldly fought in her defence, and proved his attachment to her cauſe not by words only, but by deeds. The play itſelf alſo ſpeaks a different language; and evidently proves it was written in ridicule of political hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, and not of the true friends of their country.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the other poems, I believe the tranſlation of Ovid will be found to be very correct
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:034158_0005_0FFC8472521F9278"/>
and highly poetical. The author intended, if he had lived, to tranſlate the whole work, but death put an end to his deſign. The ſmaller poems I ſubmit to the reader, without ſaying any thing of their merit, as I wiſh not to foreſtall a pleaſure, or to raiſe too great expectations.</p>
            <p>With theſe ſhort obſervations, gentle reader, I bid thee adieu; with a ſincere wiſh that the work before thee may afford thee rational amuſement.</p>

                     <p>I'm glad to hear it. Sir John Tod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is a clever open-hearted gentleman as I ever knew, one that wont turn his back upon a poor man, but will take a chearful cup with one as well as another, and it does honour to Mr. Wou'dbe to prefer ſuch a one, to any of your whifflers who han't the heart to be generous, and yet deſpiſe poor folks. Huzza! for Mr. Wou'dbe and for Sir John Toddy.</p>

                     <p>I think ſo too, neighbour. Mr. Wou'dbe, I always thought, was a man of ſenſe, and had larning, as they call it, but he did not love di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion enough, I like him the better for't. Huzza for Mr. Wou'dbe and Sir John Toddy.</p>

                     <p>I have heard as much, and more that's lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to his credit. He has hurt us more than he'll do us good for one while. It's his doings our levies are ſo high.</p>

But, gentlemen, 'tis not fair play: don't abuſe our friend, and we'll let your's alone. Mr. Wou'dbe is a clever gentleman, and perhaps ſo are the reſt: let every man vote as he pleaſes, and let's raiſe no ſtories to the prejudice of either.</p>

If he does us no good, he will do us no harm. Mr. Strut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about would do very well if he was not ſuch a cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb. As for Smallhopes, I'd as ſoon ſend to New-Market, for a burgeſs, as ſend him, and old Sir John loves tipple too well: egad, I'll give Wou'dbe my vote, and throw away the other.

                     <p>MR. Trueman, I am happy to ſee you. In times like theſe, of war and danger, almoſt every man is ſuſpicious even of his friend; but with you I may converſe with the utmoſt confidence.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>True.</speaker>
                     <p>My dear Meanwell, I know your heart, and am ſorry that any man can ſuſpect its purity; but our caſe is much the ſame.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mean.</speaker>
                     <p>What? are you too accuſed of toryiſm?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>True.</speaker>
                     <p>I am indeed. Unfortunately, I have ſome enemies who have raiſed the cry againſt me. And what is worſe, I fear the conſequences will be ſerious, and a little uncommon.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mean.</speaker>
                     <p>How?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>True.</speaker>
                     <p>They will be bad indeed if they cauſe the loſs of the girl I love. To your friendly boſom I may truſt the ſecrets of my heart. The lovely Mira, daughter of our old neighbour Brazen has won my affections. You know her beauteous form; but that is but an image of her ſoul, its more charming inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. I had ſeen and loved her: her father declared his approbation of my paſſion, and encouraged me to proceed. Heaven ſeemed to promiſe me ſucceſs, and the idol of my ſoul had with bluſhing tenderneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:034158_0052_0FFC8405786D53E8"/>
to be my bride. But all our hopes may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be blaſted by this unfortunate circumſtance.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mean.</speaker>
                     <p>Indeed!</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>True.</speaker>
                     <p>It cannot be doubted. Her father is a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent patriot without knowing the meaning of the word. He underſtands little or nothing beyond a dice-box and race-field, but thinks he knows every thing; and woe be to him that contradicts him! His politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal notions are a ſyſtem of perfect anarchy, but he reigns in his own family with perfect deſpotiſm. He is fully reſolved that nobody ſhall tyrannize over him, but very content to tyrannize over others. I happened in converſation to oppoſe ſome of his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines of a ſtate of nature and liberty without reſtraint, and he blazed out immediately like a flaſh of gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder. I endeavored to moderate his anger; but as reaſon and he can never be reconciled, I am afraid my ſins will never be forgiven; beſides, I have a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enemy and rival in Captain Flaſh.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mean.</speaker>
                     <p>Ay, that is the drawcanſir of modern times; a fellow who pretends to cat the ſmoke of a cannon freſh from the mouth, and to kill all the enemies of his country, as Caligula would the Roman people, at one blow. But I believe he's a coward at bottom.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>True.</speaker>
                     <p>So do I. But Old Brazen is perſuaded that not even Waſhington is his parallel. As I pretend not to extravagant valour, the captain thinks me a puny milkſop, and judges it very great preſumption in me to pretend to the lady he adores. I expect he has aſſiſted the old man's prepoſſeſſion againſt me; and, by his aſſertions, convinced him I am a tory:— But this is certain, the old gentleman declared that I
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:034158_0053_0FFC84033142A438"/>
ſhould never enter his doors with his conſent again, and moreover has commanded his daughter to think no more of having me for her huſband.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mean.</speaker>
                     <p>What a pity it is that all heads are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of receiving the benign influence of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of liberty—ſome are too weak to bear it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thoroughly intoxicated. The cauſe of my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try appears as dear to me as to thoſe who moſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately declaim on the ſubject. The rays of the ſun of freedom, which is now riſing, have warmed my heart; but I hope my zeal againſt tyranny will not be ſhewn by bawling againſt it, but by ſerving my country againſt her enemies; and never may I ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalize my attachment to liberty by perſecuting inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent men, only becauſe they differ in opinion with me.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>True.</speaker>
                     <p>It ſeems for this very reaſon you are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a patriot; but truth will at laſt prevail, the faithful heart be applauded, and the noiſy hypocrite ſtripped of the maſk of patriotiſm.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mean.</speaker>
                     <p>I hope ſo; and therefore truth, plain truth, ſhall be the only ſhield I will uſe againſt my foes. Men who aim at power without merit, muſt conceal the meanneſs of their ſouls by noiſy and paſſionate ſpeeches in favour of every thing which is the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent opinion of the day; but real patriots are mild, and ſecretly anxious for their country, but modeſt in expreſſions of zeal. They are induſtrious in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſervice, but claim no glory to themſelves.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>True.</speaker>
                     <p>May the armies of America be always led by ſuch as theſe! Thus will the power of Britain be
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:034158_0054_0FFC8400F2A243D8"/>
overthrown, and peace with liberty return—May men like theſe conduct our government, and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in the train of independence, will bleſs the ſmil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing land! But before this can be accompliſhed many temporary evils muſt be ſupported with patience.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mean.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, and this under which we now labour among the reſt. But what do you propoſe to do in the caſe of your lovely Mira? you won't give up the purſuit?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>True.</speaker>
                     <p>Give up the purſuit? When I do, may I be hanged as a traitor to love! But it ſeems a little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult at preſent. I have taken the liberty to uſe your ſervant already in the buſineſs. As he very lately came into this part of the country, and poſſeſſes a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry genteel air, I thought he might eaſily paſs for a gentleman with old Brazen. I equip'd him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as an officer, and ſent him to the houſe of the old gentleman; and ordered him to paſs himſelf for a travelling captain, and to wait for an opportunity of delivering a letter to Mira. He executed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion with fidelity, and brought me an anſwer from her, in which ſhe communicates to me all that I have told you.</p>

                     <p>I have no charge againſt them, gentlemen. I have talk'd the matter over with them, and am proud to find they are innocent.</p>

                     <p>Well, well, what a pity! is there nobody here that can make any thing appear againſt them? We ſhall be laugh'd at if they get off ſo; indeed we ſhall, my friends.</p>

That young man is out of the way at a very improper time, and may probably have ſome trick in view. He appears to be a faithful and honeſt, and at the ſame time the moſt ingenious and genteel ſervant, I ever ſaw; but nevertheleſs, it is not impoſſible but he may have a mixture of the rake in his diſpoſition. Let me ſee, what girl is there hereabouts whom he can have in view? It is not my wiſh to pry into all the actions of my ſervants, but no improper conduct muſt be permitted.</p>

                     <p>There, your honour, was the beginning of all the miſchief. You know Mr. Spendall, her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was a very extravagant man. He liv'd at a great rate, and gam'd and horſe-raced it very much, ſo that he ſoon brought himſelf to ruin. But that was not all, for, beſides all this, he treated the lady, his wife, very ill, indeed. She had brought him a fine fortune, and he had ſpent it: ſo he thought her heart always up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided him for it, and that made him worſe, but Lord help the poor lady, ſhe was ſo ſweet and kind hearted, ſhe bore no malice to any body.</p>

                     <p>No wonder it ſhould, your honour, but as I was about to ſay, the poor lady you know had a child, which was generally ſuppoſed to have died when it was two months old. Her huſband was at that time gone upon a long journey which he took in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to keep out of the way of his creditors, and the report was ſpread to deceive him, and a pretended funeral was had.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>John.</speaker>
                     <p>Neither did any body elſe: but the poor lady had brought the child to me. I ſhall never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get her looks. It was not long before ſhe died. John, ſays ſhe, I know I ſhall ſhortly die, my heart is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and I am going to a better world than this. My only tie to earth is this tender infant: may ſhe never feel her mother's ſorrow! This infant I cannot have in the houſe of a man who has forgotten all the feelings of a huſband, who would educate her in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>uous. When I am dead, and my huſband is no more, who I know when alive, will never permit her to reſide with him, convey her to my brother if he ſhall then be living. I know his generous ſoul: he will be indeed a father to her: as a proof of her birth, preſent him with this picture of his wretched ſiſter, which he gave her himſelf. Here it is, an't pleaſe your honour.

               <l>I'll have a pack two foot at leaſt.</l>
               <l>Their hats and mantles on they drew,</l>
               <l>And inſtant to the meadow flew.</l>
               <l>A vicious ram was there confin'd,</l>

               <l>The ewes, and lambs, and other ſheep,</l>

            <p>The poem to which the above was written, as an anſwer, has, I believe, been long ſince forgotten; and as the author was acknowledged to be a very worthy and reſpectable man, though a very bad poet, his ſhame ſhould be forgotten alſo. The ſatire is therefore publiſhed without the name of the author, and thus it is hoped, ſome inſtruction to other writers, and ſome diverſion to the reader my be gathered from it, without injuring the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of any perſon whatever. Thoſe who have read the work alluded to, (which the reader will obſerve, was printed many years ago with no name annexed,) will judge for themſelves, whether its ſentence here pronounced, was juſt or not; and thoſe who never have, and probably never will, may conſider the anſwer as a deſcription of bad poetry in general, in which light it is now given to the world, and may be ſerviceable in reſtraining thoſe who ſcribble prophanely or indecently, without the ſkill to compoſe verſe, or ſenſe to entertain their readers.</p>

            <head>COLIN and CELIA: A PASTORAL POEM.</head>
            <l>WHERE ſlumb'ring ſtreams in liquid ſilence flow,</l>
            <l>And fragrant beauties on their borders grow;</l>
            <l>Where ſmiling nature greets th' approach of ſpring,</l>
            <l>And warbling ſongſters ſoothing ſonnets ſing;</l>
            <l>Where gentle gales their fanning wings diſplay,</l>
            <l>And whiſper pleaſures as they ſteal away;—</l>
            <l>There Colin wand'ring, loſt in dreams of love,</l>
            <l>Saw Celia's form in clouded beauty move;</l>
            <l>He heard her words in trembling accents break,</l>
            <l>Then ſtep'd aſide, to liſten, as ſhe ſpake.</l>
            <l>He vow'd to love, with ſweet ſubmiſſion ſwore,</l>
            <l>But hapleſs Celia ne'er may view him o'er.</l>
            <l>Her moving words the balmy breezes bear,</l>
            <l>And gently waft them to the ſhepherd's ear.</l>
            <l>Each ſoothing ſound his deep attention caught,</l>
            <l>But Celia's name enraptur'd ev'ry thought—</l>
            <l>When ſmoothly gliding thro' the ſilent grove,</l>
            <l>She ſaw her Colin melting into love,</l>
            <l>"<hi>His ſoul thus utt'rance gave.</hi>"</l>
            <bibl>MILTON.</bibl>
            <l>Why dubious, Celia, of thy Colin's love,</l>
            <l>And why lamenting to the ſilent grove?</l>
            <l>In early youth your pleaſing chains I bore,</l>
            <l>And captive ſtill, my lovely maid, adore.</l>
            <l>Should Venus, circled in an orb of charms,</l>
            <l>With ſweet ſubmiſſion court me to her arms,</l>
            <l>Her all-divine would ineffectual prove,</l>
            <l>Nor cou'd her beauty make me change my love.</l>
            <l>"<hi>She bluſh'd and ſmil'd.</hi>"</l>
            <bibl>MILTON.</bibl>
            <l>Then Colin's eyes with ſparkling pleaſure roll,</l>
            <l>A torrent rapture ruſhing to his ſoul.</l>
            <l>He ſmiling ſprings, in tranſport, views her charms,</l>
            <l>And claſps her gently yielding in his arms.</l>
