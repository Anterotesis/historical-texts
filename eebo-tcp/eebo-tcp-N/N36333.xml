            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>SEAFARING people are that claſs of mankind who are ſuppoſed to be in perfect health when they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rol themſelves for any particular voyage or cruiſe; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their hardineſs, they are liable to many and numerous excruciating maladies, during the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of their reſpective voyages to different parts of the world: Whatever, therefore has a tendency to meliorate, or render comfortable the ſituation of the ſick on board of veſſels, muſt be an acquiſition truly important and uſeful to all navigators. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by way of preface to the directions for a ſea medicine cheſt, offer ſome general outlines on the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance and management of the principal diſeaſes which occur to ſeamen in different voyages and places. It has been a common practice to put up medicine cheſts, with directions containing the doſes and virtues

               </gap> article only. This cannot be of much ſervice to the people, unleſs the maſter or preſcriber has a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious knowledge of diſeaſes, or is a perſon of judgment ſufficient to diſcern the character of the diſeaſe, and thereby judge what particular indication is beſt ſuited remove it.</p>
            <p>Many ſick people at ſea have ſuffered much, and had their complaint prolonged, in conſequence of a too frequent, and often oppoſite repetition of medicines; this is in conſequence of the ſimilarity there is in the ſymptoms of many diſeaſes, which in their reſpective natures, are diametrically oppoſite, and which, without ſome general rule or guide, no man can make a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary diſtinction. The ſhort ſyſtem which I here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, will be brief and conciſe; at the ſame time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining an illuſtration of circumſtances, neceſſary to mark the general characteriſtic, on which moſt of the diſeaſes incident to ſeamen, depend. Whereby the maſter may know on what grounds to preſcribe his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, and how he may judge of their effects, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct his applications through all the variety of ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms that occur, in general diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>Sailors are very apt to be careleſs of their health, eſpecially while in port, and expoſe themſelves to every intemperance that can poſſibly produce the occaſional cauſes of diſeaſes. It is therefore incumbent on the maſter to watch his people cloſely, while under his care; and when ſick, to make faithful inveſtigation reſpecting their conduct and habits, during a number of days before the arrival of the diſeaſe.</p>

                  </gap>, and ſometimes purgings; the patient is uneaſy and reſtleſs, but complains of no particular pain except in the head, which ſometimes occaſions deliriums, a wildneſs, and incoherent ſpeaking, pulling and hauling the bed cloaths, &amp;c. Theſe ſymptoms continue 6 or 8 hours, when they abate a little, but return again to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards night with their former violence, and continue to obſerve theſe periods until the 9th, 11th, 14th, and ſometimes run on to the 20th and 24th day of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, before a ſolution terminates either in death or health. Theſe different periods of the diſeaſe vary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the climate, ſtate of the patient's conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nature of the reigning diſeaſes of the place, and a variety of circumſtances which often ſhorten or lengthen a fever: It is to be obſerved that different people with different conſtitutions will be differently affected with the ſame fever. Some are attacked with all the above mentioned ſymptoms, with violent vomitings of black matter, and bleeding at the noſe, eyes and gums; others with the ſame fever, in the ſame place and veſſel, have all thoſe ſymptoms mild, and a very clear head, with quiet ſtomach and bowels; others again are ſeized with violent heat and pains in the head and bones, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the greateſt tortures two or three days, and die ſudden. Theſe laſt circumſtances depend on the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of living; to frequent intoxication, and being late out in night air fogs, lying on deck evenings; carouſing in hot, cloſe houſes, and ſuddenly going into the air; the nature of the prevailing ſickneſs in port; being in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  <p>AFTER having examined the patient's conſtitution, his habits of living, and the ſtate of his ſtomach and bowels; and whether thoſe ſymptoms mentioned above, are actually preſent, the judgment will dictate what particular evacuation will be moſt proper. If the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at ſtomach, with vomiting of bile, is the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, it will be proper to give a vomit, No. 1. and after the operation is finiſhed, if the heat, thirſt, quick pulſe, and ſymptoms of fever continue to rage, blood letting muſt be had recourſe to, drawn freely, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated as the ſymptoms require, having regard to the robuſt habit of the patient, &amp;c. It is to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, that we cannot be too free with the lancet in many climates, eſpecially in the Weſt-Indies, and in our ſouthern ſtates, among the fevers incident to thoſe cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates; after bleeding, a purge, No. 3. is to be given, and ſhould it not operate largely, it muſt be repeated again. Theſe three general evacuations are only to be depended upon in the cure of fevers, and muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated as the ſymptoms of fever and violence of the complaint indicate. For drink, the fever julep, No. 18. may be taken often, by mixing it with water, barley tea cold, beverage, lemonade water, or fifteen or twenty drops of No. 10. mixed with a pint of water, may be

a drink conſtantly, and is very proper in hot climates, where putrefaction is to be dreaded; crem. Tartar water, &amp;c. The patient muſt be kept cool, and ſuffered to breathe pure air.</p>
                  <p>If notwithſtanding the exhibition of theſe general indications of <hi>vomiting, bleeding, purging,</hi> and <hi>cooling,</hi> the fever ſhould run on till it terminates in a putrid, diſſolved ſtate of the blood, which is known by an abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all pains or uneaſineſs; a black, dry tongue, with a yellow ſtreak acroſs the middle of it; ſtinking breath, and weakening, clammy ſweats, hollow eyes, blood ſtarting from the gums, noſe, bowels, and the recovery of his ſenſes, you muſt lay aſide all thoſe cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing medicines, and give freely of No. 4. No. 11. brandy, wine, and waſh the patient freely in good ſpirits and vinegar, keeping his cabin well ventilated, &amp;c. But in this ſtage of the buſineſs it will be proper to have the advice of a phyſician.</p>
