            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>Gentlemen of the Grand-Jury;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>YOU muſt have obſerved, that of late there have been ſeveral Papers printed, with a Deſign and a Tendency to alienate the Affections of His Majeſty's Subjects of this Province from the Perſons whom His Majeſty has thought it fitting to ſet over them; and in particular, ſome Men with the utmoſt Vir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ency have endeavoured to aſperſe his Excellency and vilify his Adminiſtration; they have ſpread abroad many ſeditious Libels, in order to leſſen in the People's Minds the Regard which is due to a Perſon in his high Station. This malevolent Practice <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> has laid me under the Neceſſity of ſetting before you the Law in relation to Libels. And as ye are Gentlemen of Underſtanding and Integrity, and who will pay a due Regard to the Oaths ye have taken, I make no queſtion, but you will take ſuch Notice as becomes you, of the Perſon who has had the Preſumption to print them. The Authors are not certainly known, and yet it is an eaſy Matter to gueſs who they are, that by making Uſe of Mr. <hi>Van Dam</hi>'s Name, have gain'd ſome credit among the common People, which they were not wont to have, and never thought to have deſerved.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Every Libel is made either againſt a private Man or againſt a Magiſtrate, or publick Perſon: If it be againſt a private Man, it deſerves a ſevere Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for although the Libel be made againſt one, yet it incites all thoſe of the ſame Family, Kindred or Society to Revenge; and tends by Conſequence
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:003696_0002_100248085C91CC08"/>
to Quarrels and Breach of the Peace, and may be the Cauſe of ſhedding Blood, and of great Inconvenience; which it would be impoſſible to reſtrain by the ſevereſt Laws, were there no Redreſs from publick Juſtice for Injuries of this Kind, which of all others are moſt ſenſibly felt. If the Libel be againſt a Magiſtrate or other publick Perſon, it is a greater Offence; for it concerns not only the Breach of the Peace, but the Scandal of Government.</p>
               <p>AND it is not material whether the Libel be true, or whether the Party be of good or evil Fame; for in a ſettled State of Government the Party grieved ought to complain for every Injury done him in an ordinary Courſe of Law, and not by any Means to revenge himſelf either by the odious Courſe of libelling or otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>POISONING is accounted a greater Offence than any open kind of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, becauſe it may be done ſo ſecretly, that none can defend himſelf againſt it, for which Cauſe the Offence is the more dangerous, becauſe the Offender can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily be known; and of ſuch Nature is libelling; it is ſecret and robs a Man of his good Name, which ought to be more precious to him than his Life.</p>
            </q>
            <p>LIBELLING a Perſon in ſo high a Station as that of the Governor is of the more dangerous Conſequence, becauſe without his Concurrence, (as He is the King's Repreſentative here) we cannot leave ſuch good and wholeſom Laws, as this Colony ſtands in need of; and certainly if he be libelled, and Endeavours be uſed to vilify his Perſon and Adminiſtration, and the Authors and Publiſher be ſuffered to go on with impunity in ſuch Practices, we ſhall ſcarcely find him in a ſuitable Temper to paſs ſuch Laws for the publick Good as ſhall be laid before him.</p>
            <p>IT is a difficult Thing to ſay what ſome Men would be at, or what it is will pleaſe them; ſome Particulars of his Excellency's Conduct in this City were ſaid to have given Offence, upon ſome of his Friends repreſenting to him what would be acceptable to the People in general, he made an Alteration in thoſe Points: And yet this too, is a ſubject for theſe Men's Diſlike, ſo that which way ſoever he acts, they are reſolved to clamour: And in good Truth, now they have the greateſt Reaſon to be diſſatisfied, ſince they find that his Excellency is determined to do that which will be agreeable to the People, they are ſenſible he will by theſe Means effectually defeat their Meaſures and render all their Schemes abortive.</p>
            <p>THE Malice of theſe Men ſtopt not here; they have condeſcended to come a Step lower, and have been pleaſed to point out ſeveral of the Gentlemen of the Council, who happen to have Places of Truſt under His Majeſty in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince: I ſuppoſe they would ſuggeſt by this, they are ſo mercenary and ſo aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned as to betray the Country and give up the Publick for the Sake of them. As for my own part, I am very eaſy under theſe Reproaches; I am aſſured my Conduct in that or any other Station can ſtand the Teſt of their moſt malitious Inquiry: To make their Work compleat, the Judges of this Court have alſo had the Honour to be the Objects of their Reſentment, for ſurely it cannot be a Diſhonour to an honeſt Man to meet with the Anger and Ill-will of ſome Men. They have endeavoured by all kinds of Arts to make the People uneaſy at the <hi>Court of Exchequer,</hi> and I ſuppoſe buoy themſelves in their proſperous Miſchief; But I am perſuaded, that any Uneaſineſs, which is conceived at it, will in a little Time wear off and vaniſh, as it is altogether owing to the moſt unjuſt Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentation of its Juriſdiction, as if the Exerciſe thereof in a Court of Equity would take away that ineſtimable Privilege of Trials by a <hi>Jury.</hi> This <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> is a wicked Inſinuation made uſe of to inflame the Minds of the common People, and to render the Perſons of the Judges, who gave their Opinions in ſupport of this Juriſdiction, odious to them. But I depend on it, that the Force of Truth will in a little Time remove the groundleſs Jealouſies that have been raiſed on this Occaſion, by the Craft of evil-minded Men, who enraged
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003696_0003_1002480ACBC559F8"/>
at their own Diſappointment care not into what Diſorders they bring us, to obtain their Ends.</p>
            <p>THE Prejudices conceived againſt this Court oblige me to ſay ſomething to ſatisfy the Scruples that have induſtriouſly been raiſed in ſome Men's Minds concerning it.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Court of Exchequer</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> in which the Barons are Judges, is chiefly a Court for the King's Revenues, and has Cognizance of Pleas at the common Law, and a Power of determining Cauſes in a Courſe of Equity by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bill; Theſe are the judicial Powers of the Barons, and have been ſo Time out of Mind, and their Authority to determine Cauſes in Equity doth not ariſe from the Stat. 33. <hi>H.</hi> 8. as ſome hold; this appears in the 4 Inſt. 119. We there find, that the Commons petitioned in 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. (which then was the Method uſed in making Acts of Parliament) that no Writs or Privy-Seals be ſued out of the <hi>Chancery, Exchequer,</hi> or other Place to any Man to appear upon Pain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to anſwer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> contrary to the ordinary Courſe of the common Law: Whereunto the King anſwered, <hi>That ſuch Writs ſhould not be granted without Neceſſity.</hi> This Writ <hi>To appear upon Pain,</hi> is the <hi>Subpaena,</hi> which is the leading Proceſs in a Court of Equity. But this did not paſs into a Law. In the third Year of <hi>H.</hi> 5. the Commons petitioned, that all Writs of <hi>Subpaena</hi> and <hi>Certes de cauſis</hi> going out of the <hi>Chancery</hi> and the <hi>Exchequer</hi> might be enrolled and not granted of Matters determinable at the common Law on Pain of <hi>Forty Pounds.</hi> The King's Anſwer was, <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t he would be adviſed:</hi> Which is denying the Royal Aſſent to paſs it into a Law. Hence it is evident, that the Court of <hi>Exchequer</hi> as well as <hi>Chancery</hi> did proceed in a Courſe of Equity above One hundred Years before the making of this Statute 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8. which is ſaid to give Birth to this Branch of its Juriſdiction; ſo that it muſt have been Time out of Mind, ſince as My Lord <hi>Coke</hi> obſerves, 4 Inſt. 119. We find no former Act of Parliament that doth create and eſtabliſh it. <hi>Plowd. Com.</hi> 321. It is ſaid, the Exchequer hath a Chancellor and Seal, and the Writs uſual in the Chancery in the Exchequer to ſeize Land are more antient than the Regiſter or the Treatiſe of <hi>Praerogativa Regis</hi> Upon which My Lord <hi>Coke</hi>'s Obſervation is this; <hi>Hereunto it is collected, that ſeeing there hath been Time out of Mind of Man, a Chancellor of the Exchequer, that there should alſo be in the Exchequer a Court of Equity.</hi> For theſe Reaſons we may conclude, that this Court did not derive its Juriſdiction in Equity from that Statute, but from the common Law.</p>
            <p>AS to the Stat. 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8. it may be ſaid to conſiſt of two Parts, the one for the Benefit and Advantage of the King, whereby a new Proviſion is made for the levying of the Kings Debt in a more ſpeedy and effectual Manner, than the King had before: The other Part, is for the Benefit and Advantage of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and gives him a Remedy where he had none before, and enables him, if he has any Matter, in Law, Reaſon, or good Conſcience, to bar or diſcharge the Kings Debt, to ſhew or plead the ſame, which by the common Law he could not do. All which appears in Sir <hi>Tho. Cecil</hi>'s Caſe, 7 <hi>Rep.</hi> 18 <hi>b.</hi> Where although the Covenant and Obligation of Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> was broken and fotfeited by the Rigor of the Common Law, yet as he had Matter in Reaſon and good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to diſcharge himſelf, he by exhibiting his Engliſh Bill in the <hi>Exchequer</hi> was relieved againſt the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Demand by Virtue of this Statute; ſo that this Statute gives the Subject a Remedy in Equity in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> which he had not before. And theſe were the Ends for which this Statute was made.</p>
            <p>AS for the <hi>Court of Exchequer</hi> here, I ſhall give you, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Reaſon upon which it is grounded, without deſcending into many Particulars; but before I come to that, it may not be improper to obſerve, That Courts for the due Adminiſtration of Juſtice are eſſential to every Community; No Government can or ever did ſubſiſt long without them; They are of abſolute Neceſſity to ſuppreſs Violence and to be Arbiters of the differences between contending Parties, That every Man may not become

his own Carver, and thereby a Door be laid open to all manner of Iniquity and Oppreſſion. And in a Conſtitution like ours, formed upon the Model and as nearly ſimilar as Circumſtances will admit, to that of <hi>England,</hi> where Equity makes up a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Part of the Law; Courts of Juſtice are as neceſſary here as there; thoſe that proceed in a Courſe of Equity as well as thoſe that adhere more rigidly to the ſtrict Rules of the Common Law: For the Common Law lays it down as a Maxim, <hi>Rather to ſuffer a Miſchief than a general Inconvenience;</hi> and the Judges thereof are by their Oaths tied up to the ſtrict Rules of Law, and are bound to determine according to the known Cuſtoms and Statutes of the Realm, although they are at the ſame Time ſenſible, that in ſo doing, they are obliged to do an Act of manifeſt Injuſtice; Hence is the Neceſſity of Courts of Equity, to moderate the Rigor of the Law in ſome Caſes, to give Relief againſt Frauds, Accidents and ſuch like, and to prevent a Failure of Juſtice, which would otherwiſe happen by ſuch adhering to the ſtrict Rules of Law. And this alone is properly the Buſineſs of a Court of Equity, not to take away Trials by Jury, but to give Relief in Caſes, where it is not to be had by the common Law: For Cauſes triable by common Law and a Jury are improper for a Court of Equity, <hi>Heb.</hi> 203.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>GENTLEMEN,</hi> The general Reaſon upon which the Court ſtands here, is this: In caſe of an uninhabited Country newly found out by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects, all the Laws in Force in <hi>England,</hi> are in Force there. This is the Reſolution of My Lord <hi>Holt</hi> and the whole Court, and ſeemed to be agreed at the Bar, <hi>Falk.</hi> 411. This is from the Neceſſity of the Thing: For among a Number of Men, there muſt unavoidably ariſe ſome Differences and Diſſentions; which it is moſt natural to think they would determine by ſuch Laws as they were acquainted with, which muſt be by the Laws of their <hi>Mother Country;</hi> and there is the ſame Neceſſity that it ſhould be <hi>in ſuch Courts</hi> and <hi>by ſuch Officers</hi> and <hi>in ſuch Methods</hi> as were known to them, and in Uſe in their Mother Country. "For where Officers are wanting, ſays my Lord <hi>Holt,</hi> our Laws can have no Force, <hi>Falk.</hi> 412. So that if as <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> We claim the Laws of <hi>England</hi> as our Birth-right, we are moſt certainly intitled to the Courts, in which the Laws may be adminiſtred, which Courts are by, and part of the common Law; For where is the Uſe or Force of Laws, unleſs they can be put in Execution? This can only be done by proper Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; and to ſay We have a Right to the Laws, and not to the Adminiſtration of Juſtice according to thoſe Laws, in ſuch manner as we may reap the Fruit of them, what is this but a groſs Abſurdity? So that if the binding Force of the Laws of <hi>England</hi> here, is either from a right inherent in us as <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> or from that Neceſſity which makes it ſuppoſed, that we received the Laws under which our Anceſtors lived before their Settlement here, and agreed to be governed by them for want of another Law; In ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Caſe, nothing more was wanting than Judges and other Officers to adminiſter the Laws as in our <hi>Mother Country,</hi> and give them their Force; and the Appointment of the Judges and Officers is Part of the King's Praerogative, or more properly of his Office, But the Juriſdiction of the Court is from the Law; Judges have accordingly been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and their Commiſſions have run for above theſe Thirty Years paſt with only inconſiderable Alterations, as they do now.</p>
            <p>AND I find upon peruſal of the Minutes of this Court, That ſo long ago as the Year 1702. a <hi>Court of Exchequer</hi> was held before <hi>William Atwood</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> the then Chief Juſtice, <hi>Abraham De Poyſter</hi> and <hi>Robert Walter</hi> Eſqrs; in which ſome Proceedings were had on the Plea ſide. I do not find any Proceedings in the Exchequer from that Time, (tho' poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly I may have overlooked ſome) till the Year 1729. When the Hon. <hi>Lewis Morris,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> my Predeceſſor ſat alone in Court, and it was upon the Motion of Mr. <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, viz.</hi>

            <p>YOU ſee, Gentlemen, that by this Motion it is ſuppoſed, that this Court is veſted with the Powers of the Court of Exchequer, and ſo allowed by the Chief Juſtice, by granting the Motion, what the Powers of the Court of Exchequer are, wherein the Barons are Judges, I mentioned before, to wit, Cognizance of Pleas at the common Law, and a Power of determining Cauſes in a Courſe of Equity by Engliſh Bill, and the Writ prayed for by this Motion, iſſues out of the Chancery of the Exchequer. <q>And the Writs uſual in the Chancery in the Exchequer to ſeize the Land in ſuch Caſes are more antient than the Regiſter or the Treatiſe of <hi>Praerogativa Regis.</hi>
               </q> I meet with no other Proceedings in the Exchequer until Mr. Preſident <hi>Van Dam</hi>'s Time, when a Bill was filed, which happened in this Manner. In the Winter 1731. during Mr. <hi>Van Dam</hi>'s Adminiſtration there was held a Weekly meeting of the Judges in Town, &amp; ſome of the moſt conſiderable Lawyers; at one of theſe Meetings it was propoſed by one of them to bring the Equity Buſineſs into this Court, and a Queſtion ariſing, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Judges were ſufficiently impowered by their Commiſſion to determine Cauſes brought by Engliſh Bill? My Commiſſion and my Brother <hi>Philipſe</hi>'s were brought and conſidered, and it was agreed by Us all, <hi>to wit,</hi> Meſſrs. <hi>Alexander, Horſemanden, Murray, Chambers, Smith, Jameſon</hi> and <hi>Warrel,</hi> who were preſent at that Meeting, that the Judges were well impowered, and upon that they reſolved to bring the Buſineſs here according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for theſe and other Reaſons, becauſe the Buſineſs in Chancery muſt be attended with intolerable Delays; The Governors who act as Chancellors being obliged to be ſometimes in <hi>Jerſey</hi> to meet the Aſſembly of that Province, and ſometimes at <hi>Albany</hi> to meet the Indian Nations, beſides that, few of them care to be troubled with that Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, this made Suits in Equity in that Court very tedious and expenſive, and it was thought it could not be diſagreeable to the People in general, who muſt believe their Properties well ſecured in the Hands of ſworn Judges, whoſe Buſineſs it is to ſtudy the Laws, and whoſe Eſtates and Families are in this Country; It was ſaid that that was the propereſt Time, when there was no Governor appointed that we knew of, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps might think that the leaving his Court and bringing the Equity Buſineſs into this, was done out of Diffidence towards him, and none of the Lawyers would care to be the firſt to expoſe himſelf to a Governor's Diſlike; Theſe were the Reaſons among many others made uſe of at that Time, to alter the Current of the Practice in Equity, and turn it into the Channel it now runs in. And accordingly a Bill was filed in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer in <hi>March</hi> Term 1731. long before the Governor's Arrival here, directed to the Hon. <hi>Lewis Morris</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Chief Juſtice, and the reſt of the Juſtices, and on Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Proceſs ordered by him in open Court.</p>
            <p>I mention theſe things, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> to remove a miſtaken Notion moſt People have taken up, I am told, as if this Court were erected by Ordinance in the preſent Governor's Time, in order to bring on a Suit, brought by the Attorney General in his Majeſty's Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half againſt Mr. <hi>Van Dam.</hi> I hope the People will in a little Time be undeceived, both as to this Court and the Men who have ſignalized themſelves in Oppoſition to that which they once approved and promoted; looking a few Years back will open their Eyes, and ſo defeat and fruſtrate the Expectations of ſuch as delight in Confuſion.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Ordinance,</hi> it was chiefly intended to appoint the Times of the Sittings (for the Times of holding all our Courts have been always ſettled by Ordinances) that the Suits here might not prove ſo tedious and expenſive as they were found to be in Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, where, in a very memorable Caſe, it was ſaid, the Charges were run up to many hundred Pounds, though the Caſe was determined upon Bill and Anſwer.</p>
            <p>As to the grand Objection that has been made, <hi>That the King cannot erect a Court of Equity, ſo neither can he erect another Court of Kings Bench or Common Pleas in</hi> England. So that if the Objection hold good, in the ſenſe ſome would underſtand it, We have no Supreme Court at all. The Conſequences of which are very Terrible, and obvious to every conſiderate Man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:003696_0006_1002480FA28C44D0"/>Upon the whole, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> altho' ſome Men have been exceedingly free with my Character, I can eaſily forgive them; I dare ſay, they have not that ill Opinion of me themſelves, which they would infuſe into others; but as I am in this Station now, and as long as I ſhall have the Honour to continue in it, I will ſupport and maintain the Dignity and Authority of this Court, till it be declared in a regular and legal Way by ſome higher Court, that we have not Juriſdiction in Equity. I have often ſince I gave my Opinion touching the Juriſdiction of this Court, conſidered the Reaſons, Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Authorities in Law made uſe of on both ſides, as I can ſee no reaſon to Retract my Opinion, on the contrary I am fully ſatisfied in my Conſcience, that I am in the Right.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> I have detained you a conſiderable Time; you are ſenſible of the neceſſity there is of clearing up theſe Matters, which, I hope, I have done to your Satisfaction. Nothing remains but that in general you are charged to Preſent all ſuch Offences as ſhall come to your Knowledge, from <hi>Treaſons</hi> down to <hi>Treſpaſſes.</hi> I know moſt of you Perſonally, and I make no doubt but you will diſcharge your Duty.</p>
