            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

The ſlighteſt View of our own Conſtitution and Powers, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately diſcovers to us, that we ſtand in need of ſome foreign Aſſiſtance; and puts us upon that important Enquiry, Whence we came, and whither we all tend? And the natural and neceſſary Anſwer to ſuch an Enquiry, leads us directly to God the ſupreme Author and Original of all Things; and to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge with the Pſalmiſt, that <hi>it is he who

            </p>
            <p>Now ſuch an Acknowledgment as this, teaches us, that it is both our Intereſt and Duty, to cultivate in our Minds, a ſupreme Regard towards ſo great and glorious a Being; to ſtudy and exert our utmoſt Powers, to engage his Favour; to get acquainted with his Excellencies and Perfections; and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover what Conduct will be moſt pleaſing and acceptable to him.</p>
            <p>When the divine Being is thus conſider'd, as infinitely removed from our narrow and limited Exiſtence, we are naturally led to caſt our Eyes towards him, and implore the Succours which our Weakneſs and Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection require; to humble ourſelves before him, in Conſideration of his tranſcendant Greatneſs; and to hope for a Supply from his inexhauſted Fulneſs.—And this Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the Perfections of God, and humble Addreſs to him for the Supply of our Wants, is what is called <hi>Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then, beſides this;—when we conſider him as the Author of our Being, and of that glorious Show of Things which is exhibited

            <p>Theſe are the abſolutely eſſential Parts of Chriſtian Worſhip, whether natural or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive.</p>
            <p>It muſt be confeſs'd, that even the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themſelves have not preſented us in one ſingle Paſſage, nor delineated in one View, all the ſeveral Parts of Chriſtian Worſhip, its eſſential Branches, and circumſtantial Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages; but from the many Paſſages wherein they treat of this Subject, we are left to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the ſeveral Parts of it, and unite them into one Scheme.—Our Saviour's Deſign,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:006107_0010_1027E85B98958C70"/>was not wholly to take away, but to improve only and perfect the Law of Nature, and that of <hi>Moſes.</hi> To this End, it was nor neceſſary to repeat thoſe Things which before were ſufficiently eſtabliſhed; but to rectify that which was corrupted, reſtore that which was loſt, and ſupply what was wanting, to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Syſtem of Religion.—Our Saviour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in pronouncing a Summary of Religion, comprehends the Whole, in two ſhort, but very extenſive Precepts, <hi>the Love of God, and of one another.</hi> And St. <hi>James</hi> is equally conciſe, when deſcribing the Nature of pure Religion, he makes it to conſiſt only in this, that a Man <hi>viſit the Fatherleſs and the Widows in their Affliction, and keep himſelf unſpotted from the World.</hi> But whoever undertakes to purſue theſe general and comprehenſive Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts into all the Branches they include, will find it neceſſary to attend to a great Number: not inconſiſtent indeed, but ſubordinate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> theſe general Directions. Thus tho' the New Teſtament confirms the Belief and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of one God, yet it teaches us to apply to him under the Notion and Diſtinction of Father; Son, and Holy Ghoſt: And our Addreſſes are therefore offer'd to the Father,

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>thro' the Merits and Mediation of the Son, under the Conduct and Influence of the Holy Spirit.—Prayer and Praiſe in their ſeveral Branches and Views, make up the Whole of that Worſhip, which is due to God under this Diſtinction: And if the whole Form of a worſhipping Aſſembly, is not expreſsly, and particularly delineated in any one Paſſage in the New Teſtament, yet enough is ſaid in the ſeveral Parts of it, to define the Notion of publick Chriſtian Worſhip, and to give us Examples of the Mind and Will of Jeſus Chriſt.—Thus (for Inſtance) the Lord's Prayer, beſides that it is fitted to private Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions; the very Manner and Expreſſion of it, is ſufficient to aſſure us, that it was alſo intended for publick Uſe; and the Practice of the Apoſtles upon it, is a ſufficient In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to us, to underſtand it in this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; for we frequently find them met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, eſpecially on the firſt Day of the Week, to pay their joint Addreſſes to Gods—And that we may be aſſured their Aſſemblies were warrantable, we have the Holy Ghoſt wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing to the Lawfulneſs of them, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing at one of them in a viſible Shape, and furniſhing them with more extenſive Powers,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:006107_0012_1027E860EE482500"/>for the Fulfilment of their Miniſtry.—This is ſo plain a Declaration of the Nature of Chriſtian Worſhip, that whatever we find performed in theſe Aſſemblies, we may build upon with Safety, as a lawful and acceptable Part of Chriſtian Worſhip.</p>
            <p>It is plain then in the firſt Place, from the Practice of the Apoſtles, that publick Prayer and Praiſe are eſſential Parts of Chriſtian Worſhip. For no ſooner was Chriſt aſcended into Heaven, but we find them met together in the devout and ſolemn Performance of theſe Branches of Publick Devotion. They are mentioned in the Firſt of the Acts, as being together <hi>with one Accord, in Prayer and Supplication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſecond Chapter, the Celebration of the Lord's Supper is alſo mentioned, and added to the other Devotions, as a ſolemn Part of publick Worſhip, agreeable to our Saviour's Inſtitution, ver. 42. <hi>And they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſteadfatly in the Apoſtles Doctrine and Fellowſhip, and in breaking of Bread, and in Prayers.</hi>

            <p>I proceed, ſecondly, to enquire into ſome of the chief Requiſites, or the circumſtantial Parts of it. Now theſe being only the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendages of Worſhip, we muſt not always look for a poſitive Command for them in Scripture, nor perhaps always a Scripture Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample neither; becauſe the imperfect State and firſt beginning of the Church, did not need all that Proviſion, which its preſent Maturity, and extenſive Intereſt require. The abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely eſſential Branches are plainly laid down in the New Teſtament; becauſe theſe are always the ſame, and can never v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Time and Place are neceſſary to the Performance of Divine Worſhip.—Theſe
<pb n="15"
                   facs="unknown:006107_0015_1027E86902C93220"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>are no Parts of Worſhip themſelves; and yet they have ſuch a neceſſary Relation to it, that it is impoſſible to perform any without them. Now theſe are Things about which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are entirely ſilent. Examples indeed we have, of the firſt Chriſtians meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether upon the Lord's Day; and for ſundry other Reaſons, the Chriſtian Church has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the Practice of meeting together upon this Day, to perform their publick Devotions: But with regard to Place; this is a Thing of ſuch a Nature, that no proviſionary Canon could have been made, no ſettled Rule ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; nor could any Example preſcribe to after Ages. The Apoſtles and their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts might for ſome ſhort Time poſſibly have met together in ſome one Place; but the Number of the Faithful ſoon encreaſed beyond the Poſſibility of this. And if we reflect that the Goſpel was to be propagated throughout the World, we may eaſily imagine that it would have been impoſſible to preſcribe ſet Places for them all, and for all future Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; out of which it would be unlawful for them to hold their publick Aſſemblies.—There is indeed one general proviſionary Rule intended by the Apoſtle as a Preſcription for all Things
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:006107_0016_1027E86BF05F9F08"/>of this Kind; and that is, that <hi>all Things be done decently, and in order:</hi> which plainly relates to ſuch Things as no particular expreſs Canon or Rule could poſſibly include.— That ſome convenient and decent Place or other ſhould be appointed for every worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Aſſembly, is plain from the Nature of the Thing: And as no particular Rule is. or could be provided in the Scriptures to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer all Occaſions of this Kind, it muſt be left to ſuch as have the ordinary Care of the Church entruſted to them; that is, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours and Paſtors of it, to preſcribe from time to time, as the Exigency of the Church, or any particular Branch of it, ſhall require.</p>
            <p>I ſhould not have been ſo long upon ſo plain and obvious a Point; but only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince thoſe, who deſire to be at all convinced, that it is not always neceſſary to look for an expreſs Command, nor even Example, for ſeveral neceſſary Requiſites of Chriſtian Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; but that we ſhould be content with thoſe Preſcriptions which are made by the Governours of the Church; and which is all the Proviſion that in many Caſes can be had.</p>

II. I proceed therefore to the ſecond general Enquiry, <hi>viz.</hi> How this Worſhip ought to be perform'd.</p>
            <p>Now inaſmuch as the human Nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of two Parts, Body and Soul; the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage that is due to God, muſt be adapted to both theſe Parts of our Compoſition; and muſt accordingly conſiſt of inward Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and outward Expreſſions, agreeable to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>If thou ſhalt confeſs with thy Mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in thine Heart, that God hath raiſed him from the Dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> In our private Devotions, theſe external Expreſſions of our inward Reverence, are not perhaps ſo abſolutely neceſſary, as they are in publick Devotions; becauſe God as eaſily apprehends the Conceptions of the Heart, as the Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Mouth.—Thus we are inform'd that <hi>Hannah</hi> prayed, and that with Succeſs, without any audible Voice or Expreſſion of her Requeſts; for we are told, that <hi>her Lips only moved, but her Voice was not heard.</hi> 1 Sam. 1.13.—But yet truly conſider'd, this was rather an Act of Mediation or holy Aſpiration, wherein ſhe breathed forth her Soul to God, than any formal Act of Prayer.
<pb n="18"
                   facs="unknown:006107_0018_1027E8725407B368"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>And it was doubtleſs the Singularity of the Thing which occaſioned old <hi>Eli</hi> to miſinterpret her Conduct, and charge her with Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. —And there is this Reaſon why even our private Devotions ſhould be expreſs'd with the Mouth, as well as conceived with the Heart; that God requires the Devotion of the whole Man, as he is a Compound of Soul and Body; both which are required to render due Honour to his Majeſty, and to praiſe his Goodneſs; becauſe he is the Creator of the Body, as well as the Father of our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.—Neither does this at all interfere with our Saviour's Caution of entring into the Cloſet, and praying in ſecret; for in our Retirements, we may doubtleſs expreſs the Conceptions of our Hearts, without being either ſeen or heard of Men.</p>
            <p>But as to the publick Devotions, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the outward Man is ſo abſolutely neceſſary, that I do not ſee how it is poſſible to diſcharge it at all; to be ſure not in any conſiſtent Manner, without the Aſſiſtance of bodily Organs.—This is ſo very clear and plain, that one would think it did not need inſiſting on; but inaſmuch as a long Practice to the Contrary has inclined many to think
<pb n="19"
                   facs="unknown:006107_0019_1027E873DDB62F98"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>favourably of it, I ſhall conſider it parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly.</p>
            <p>And in Order to this, I ſhall take it for granted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Poſtul.</hi> 1. In the firſt Place, that what Duty ſoever one Man owes to God, as his Creator, Redeemer, Benefactor, or the like, no other Man is able to diſcharge for him.— Every Man's Duty of this Kind, is his own, his perſonal Duty; and which therefore, unleſs the Man himſelf performs, it is not diſcharged at all. Another Man may pray with me, or intercede for me; but then it is plain ſuch Prayers is not mine, but his.— God will not accept of another Perſon's Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of my Bleſſings, ſo as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me from paying that Acknowledgment myſelf.—What is immediately owning from me of this Nature, I myſelf muſt diſcharge, or elſe it is not truly diſcharg'd.—God might indeed have accepted of vicarious Interc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſion or Mediation; and ſo he has done in the Perſon of Jeſus Chriſt; but all Mankind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides are utterly excluded. <hi>No Man</hi> (ſays the Scripture) <hi>can redeem the Soul of his Brother, nor make Agreement with God for him;</hi> and the Reaſon is plain, becauſe they are all

            <p>
               <hi>Poſtul.</hi> 2. The ſecond Thing which I ſhall take for granted, is this:—That publick De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion is the joint Concurrence of Two, Three, or more Perſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in paying their Homage to God. This, I ſay, is what is underſtood by publick Devotion; for tho' the Worſhip of one ſingle Perſon, if it be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed before Numbers of People, may in that Reſpect, be called publick, becauſe it is publickly and openly diſcharged; yet that which is generally eſteemed to be publick Worſhip, is a joint or ſocial Service, in which ſeveral People unite to prefer their common Requeſts to God.</p>

                  </gap>
               </hi> New theſe two Points being granted, it will from hence follow;—that every Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Congregation, is obliged to expreſs his Prayers and Praiſes before God, in ſuch common, fit, and proper Words, Actions, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, and the like, as are declarative of his inward Conceptions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſay, <hi>every Perſon</hi> is obliged to this.— This will follow from what was before granted, that every Man is obliged to do his own Duty, and not to depend upon any other to do it for him.</p>

2. He muſt alſo expreſs this Duty, by proper Words, or Geſtures, or both; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there would not be a joint Concurrence of the whole Congregation; inaſmuch as no one Man knows what another conceives in his Heart.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Theſe outward Expreſſions, Actions, or Geſtures, muſt be common, and known beforehand to the whole Aſſembly; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they will be liable to make different and even contrary Requeſts; which would create the utmoſt Confuſion and Abſurdity.</p>
            <p>I have omitted to make Proof of the ſeveral Particulars; partly becauſe they are too plain of themſelves to need it; and partly becauſe I take all and each of them to be intimated and confirm'd by that catholick Direction of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in his 1 Cor. 1.10. <hi>Now I beſeech you, Brethren, by the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that ye ſpeak the ſame Thing; and that there be no Diviſions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the ſame Mind, and in the ſame Judgment.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. And the firſt Remark I ſhall make, is this, That ſeeing the publick Worſhip of God conſiſts of two Parts, outward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and moreover that theſe two Parts make but one and the ſame Act of Worſhip: It from hence follows, that they who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to neglect either of theſe Parts, do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly diſcharge this Duty very imperfectly, if indeed they can be ſaid to perform it at all.— If the internal Part, or the Homage of the Mind be omitted, there is nothing left but Formality and Lip-Service. And if the Worſhip of the Body is neglected, the very Notion of a joint ſocial Worſhip is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; the Honour due to God is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn; and all our devout and pious Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Conceptions, are ſmother'd and concealed, for want of proper Inſtruments to diſcover and expreſs themſelves. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore abſolutely neceſſary to the Nature of publick Worſhip, and of great Importance in itſelf, that we join theſe Two together; and not preſume to put aſunder what God has
<pb n="26"
                   facs="unknown:006107_0026_1027E884C8AE36B8"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>thus manifeſtly united: That we form in our Minds proper Conceptions of God; and then employ all our Faculties in expreſſing before him, what we have thus piouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The foregoing Reflections, do ſurely adminiſter abundant Matter of Reproof, to all ſuch, as tho' they confeſs the Truth of theſe Things, do yet inconſiderately neglect to comply with them. Nothing is more common, than to ſee a large Part of our Aſſemblies utterly ſilent, as if they were wholly unconcern'd, while the Other are tuning their Voices to the Praiſe of the God who made them. No Man, I am ſure, can be ſo ſtupid, as to imagine, that he praiſes God, by giving his Attention to what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other performs of this Kind; but he muſt perceive it to be his Duty to join his own Endeavours, and to employ his own Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to advance the common Devotion; nor is it ſufficient to ſay, he wants a Voice; for he ought to employ that which he has, in the beſt Manner it will bear: Nor yet that he wants Skill; for why don't he labour to acquire it:—Certainly the Promiſes God has made to our Obedience, and the Benefits he
<pb n="27"
                   facs="unknown:006107_0027_1027E88A63F5CB98"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>has conferr'd upon us, deſerve that we ſhould take ſome Pains to qualify ourſelves for his Service.</p>
            <p>But even this Excuſe is wanting, to thoſe who neglect to join in the common Prayers; in which the Church has been ſo very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent, and tender, and careful of all her Children, as to provide them with the beſt and moſt familiar Helps to this Duty. She puts a Form into all their Mouths; and it muſt be exceeding Stupidity not to make Uſe of it. In this Caſe there needs no tune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Voice; nothing but a Capacity to read, nay, and ſcarcely that; for what is thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly uſed, will in a ſhort Time, be trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured up in the Memory, if it be duly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and be ready upon every Occaſion, to expreſs the devout and pious Sentiments of the Heart.</p>
            <p>And ſurely nothing but utter Inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, could have produced ſuch a fatal Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect (and I fear Contempt alſo may follow) of the publick Service.—For I would only aſk any Man, what his Deſign is, in giving his Attendance at the Houſe of God? Whether he comes there for a Viſit? and not rather to pay publick Homage and Adoration to God?

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>If ſo, let him reflect, whether he can poſſibly be conceived in any Senſe whatſoever, to have diſcharged this Duty, by ſeeing and hearing others pray and praiſe God, without bearing any Part in theſe Devotions himſelf? Has ſuch a Man honoured God in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to him? Has he made uſe of the Faculties God has graciouſly beſtowed on him, in ſetting forth his Praiſe? The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaks of ſuch as <hi>honour God with their Lips, while their Heart is far from him.</hi> I will not pretend to ſay how the Hearts of ſuch People are employed; but I am ſure their Lips are far enough from him. They deny him all outward Homage and bodily Worſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>p; and whatever they conceive, they withhold the Expreſſion, and Declaration of thoſe Praiſes which are his due, and which he expreſsly requires.</p>
            <p>It would ſtrangely ſurprize a ſerious Chriſtian, to be told, that in ſundry Years Attendance upon the publick Service of God's Houſe, he had never performed any Publick Worſhip there: But let him ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly reflect upon his ſilent Devotions in the Sanctuary, and ſee whether he can make any Thing elſe of it.

            <p>There is ſo cloſe a Union and Conjunction between the Soul and Body, that they mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually operate upon one another.

            </p>
            <p n="3">III. I now proceed to the next Thing which I promiſed to conſider; and that was the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion which our Church has made, for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering thoſe Ends of publick Devotion; and to direct you in the proper Uſe of it. For unleſs our publick Liturgy anſwers theſe Characters, and is fitted to the Ends above deſcribed; we ſhall be in danger of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

            <p>

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
Now, as to the firſt Particular. The Forming proper Sentiments of the divine Being; I may appeal to any intelligent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Whether our Liturgy does not contain the moſt noble Conceptions of God; and theſe expreſs'd in the moſt becoming Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; ſuch as every good and pious Chriſtian ought to entertain in his Mind? There is nothing mean or trifling; nothing ſuperfluous; nothing wanting; nothing unworthy of God: But every Part of it is filled, either with hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Confeſſions of our own Unworthineſs; modeſt and pious Requeſts for ſuch Things as we ſtand in need of; not urg'd with a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar, unbecoming, or ſaucy Boldneſs; but as becomes Creatures and Sinners, always with Submiſſion to the Divine Will and Pleaſure; and preferr'd in the Name and for the Sake of Jeſus the Redeemer.—So are we likewiſe provided with ſuch Forms of Praiſe and Thankſgiving, as are expreſſive, firſt, of the great ſpiritual Bleſſings we receive from God: The Creation, Preſervation, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Man; with the aſtoniſhing Method in which it was accompliſhed, and the gracious Proviſion God has made for our Souls; the means of Grace and the hopes of

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>Glory: And then for all the temporal Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and Benefits we enjoy, for the Comfort and Conſolation of this tranſitory Life.—All this, I ſay, our Service expreſſes in the moſt proper Words and Phraſes; ſuch as are ſuited both to the Majeſty of God, and to the Condition of Sinners: And except in thoſe Things that are purely miniſterial, the People have their Share allotted them in all this; and are taught and encouraged to make uſe of this their Privilege, to make theſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Devotions their own, by unitedly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring them to God, and by expreſſing them with their own Mouths; and thereby giving Glory to God, both with their Souls and Bodies.</p>
            <p>Now that all this is true of our publick Liturgy or Service, will appear, if we care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully examine the ſeveral Parts of which it is compoſed.—This is the Thing I ſhall now undertake; and as I go along, ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to inſtruct you in the proper Uſe of thoſe Devotions, which the Church, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent Mother, has put into the Hands of all her Children.</p>

And therefore the Practice of thoſe is to be condemned, who ignorantly repeat the Abſolution after the Miniſter: For this is an authoritative Act, in which God requires his Ambaſſadors to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare not only his Purpoſe, but his actual For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of every ſincere Penitent. And as the Congregation, to expreſs the Humility of their Minds, and to give God the Homage alſo of their Bodies, had juſt before made their humble Confeſſion to God upon their Knees, ſo now are they in the ſame Poſture, humbly and ſilently to receive the Declaration of his Pardon, to thoſe that are thus truly penitent.</p>
            <p>That this Pardon is applicable to ſuch only as truly repent, you may learn from <hi>Luke</hi> 13.3. <hi>Except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi> And that ſuch as do truly repent, are entitled to it, you may be ſatisfied from <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.27. <hi>When the wicked Man turneth away from his Wickedneſs that he hath committed, and doth that which is lawful and right, he ſhall ſave his Soul alive.</hi> And laſtly, that Chriſt impowers his Miniſters to make ſuch a Declaration of it, is plain from <hi>John</hi> 20.23. <hi>Whoſoever Sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them.</hi>

As therefore the Confeſſion of our Sins is the firſt, and a very conſiderable Branch of the Duty of Prayer, we are appointed to conclude it with the Uſe of this Prayer of our bleſſed Lord.

In another, he begs the Grace of God may ſo dwell in their Hearts,

A Prayer ſo exactly and wiſely calculated to all Caſes and Circumſtances of Mankind, that no one Thing is omitted, which it is proper to aſk of God; and yet all unbecoming Familiarity, and impertinent Particularities, are prudently avoided.</p>
            <p>In this, as in the foregoing Collects, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God is addreſs'd with humble Hearts and bended Knees. In this, becauſe the whole Congregation have their Share in pronouncing it before God; and in the others, becauſe it is proper the People ſhould attend to the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions of the Miniſter in their Behalf, in the like humble and reverend Poſture.—The Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany being thus ended, and the Bleſſing of God implor'd, to continue and reſide with his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; we conclude our Devotions with ſinging an Hymn or Portion of the Pſalms of <hi>David,</hi> to the Honour of God.—This is the general Order of our Morning Service, from which the Evening Service but little differs.</p>
