            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

any Probability, be ſaid to have as yet received their Accompliſhment, as, neither have thoſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, which foreſhew the flouriſhing State of the Jewiſh Church &amp; Nation in the latter Times.</p>
               <p>Moreover, 'tis to be obſerved, that under the Old Teſtament, the moſt conſiderable Perſons and Tranſactions there mentioned, were typical, and prefigured the State of Things under the Meſſias.

And it ſeems to have been a Maxim, in interpreting Prophecies, received among the Jews before Chriſt's Time, that whenever they obſerved an imperfect Completion of a Prophecy in the hiſtorical Event, which no way anſwered the lofty Expreſſions, and extenſive Promiſes, which the natural Senſe of the Text imported, then they ſuppoſed the Times of the Meſſiah to be ultimately intended, in whom all the Promiſes of God are Yea and Amen.</p>

And among this kind of Prophecies, <hi>this thirty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecond Chapter of Iſaiah,</hi> is an eminent Example, eſpecially the former Part of it, in particular the Verſes of my Text, and the two following Verſes—</p>
               <p>My Text, in the primary Senſe, is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and the Princes or Magiſtrates under him.

                  </q> God ſhall plentifully afford the Light of his Truth, and give them Grace to make a good Uſe of the Inſtructions he vouchſafes unto them. Thoſe that are weak in Faith ſhall come to more perfect Degrees of Knowlege; and the moſt rude and illiterate, ſuch as could not ſpeak ſo as to be underſtood, ſhall diſcourſe clearly &amp; intelligibly of God and of their Duty;—the barbarous Nations being converted to Chriſt, ſhall give Praiſes to God in their ſeveral Languages."<note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>Lowth'</hi>s Comment.</note>

their moſt ſublime Senſe, nor ſhall be, until the Millennial State advances, when the Kingdoms of this World ſhall become the Kingdoms of our Lord and of his Chriſt. And therefore there is not only a <hi>primary</hi> but a <hi>ſecondary Senſe</hi> of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to be attended: To which may be added, with Propriety, <hi>an accommodated Senſe,</hi> the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Illuſtration whereof will compriſe all I propoſe to offer from my Text on this great Occaſion.</p>
               <p>I. This Prophecy of a King to Reign in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and Princes to Rule in Judgment, is <hi>primarily applicable to King</hi> Hezekiah, <hi>and the Prime Miniſters of State under him,</hi> and was fulfilled in Him and Them.</p>
               <p>The firſt King of Iſrael by God's Permiſſion and Deſignation was <hi>Saul.</hi> Till this Time, God had governed the Nation by Judges, whom He raiſed up, &amp; extraordinarily inſpired, when he ſaw Occaſion. He reſerved to himſelf the ſole Power of eſtabliſhing Laws, appointing Magiſtrates, and making War.—<hi>Joſephus</hi> (in his Book againſt <hi>Apion</hi>) makes the Government of the Iſraelites before they had a King different from all other, which he calls by a new Name ΘΕΟΚΡΑΤΙΑ (a Greek Word made by him to expreſs the ſame) <hi>Theocracy,</hi> that is, the Government of God. For God exerciſed the ſupreme Authority among them by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Command.</p>
               <p>On Occaſion of the bad Conduct of <hi>Samuel'</hi>s Sons (their taking Bribes &amp; perverting Judgment) the Elders of Iſrael came to <hi>Samuel,</hi> and demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a King to be ſet over them, like the other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> Ch. 8. ver. 1,—4. God is offended

at it as an interpretative throwing off his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, who was their King, but tells <hi>Samuel</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to their Demand, ℣. 7. at the ſame Time, ordering him to ſhew them the Manner of the King that ſhould reign over them, ℣. 9. (which <hi>Samuel</hi> faithfully relates to the Elders, ℣. 11—17.) that they might know what Kind of Government they choſe in Stead of God's. <hi>Samuel</hi> from God gives them a Deſcription of a moſt arbitrary and tyrannical Government, ſuch as the Kings of the Nations had acquired, for they deſired ſuch a King as their Neighbours had, who were all under the abſolute Dominion of their Princes, which is called by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (Politic. Lib. 5.) a Deſpotick Government.</p>
               <p>The People of Iſrael had hitherto lived under Governours, raiſed up by Divine Inſtinct, who had exacted no Tribute from them, nor put them to any Charges. With which Government they being not contented, but deſiring to have a King like other Nations, that ſhould live in Pomp and Splendor, and keep ſtanding Forces about him, to be ready to reſiſt any Invaſion: <hi>Samuel</hi> informs them, what it was they deſired, that they might conſider, when they underſtood it, whether they would perſiſt in their Choice: If they would have a King magnificently attended, then he tells them, the King will take their Sons, and put them in his Chariots, &amp;c. ℣. 11. If they would have him keep up conſtant Forces, then he muſt appoint them for Colonels and Captains, and employ thoſe in his Wars, who were wont to follow their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily-Buſineſs, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. And ſince after the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of other Kings, he muſt keep a ſtately Court,

they muſt be content that their Daughters, (<hi>ver.</hi> 13.) ſhould ſerve in ſeveral Offices; which the King would think below the Dignity of his Wives and Daughters. Many Miniſters alſo in ſeveral Employments both in War &amp; Peace, muſt have Salaries to ſupport them, which muſt be paid out of their Fields and Vineyards, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. For which Services, he tells them, the King will expect the Tenth of all belonging to them, that he may main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Royal Expences, <hi>ver.</hi> 15, 16, 17. In one Word, if they will have a King, he muſt be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, after a royal Manner, out of their Eſtates.<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>Far be it from us to ſuppoſe, that <hi>Samuel</hi> here ſpeaks of a juſt and honeſt Right of Kings to do theſe Things, for their Right is quite otherwiſe deſcribed in that Part of <hi>Moſes'</hi>s Law, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the King's Duty, in <hi>Deut Ch.</hi> 17. <hi>ver.</hi> 18, 19, 20. <hi>Moſes</hi> there commands, that the King, when he ſat on the Throne, ſhould write him a Copy of the Law in a Book from the Original, or authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Copy in the Sanctuary, under the Cuſtody of the Prieſts, and that he ſhould diligently ſtudy it, and learn his Duty therefrom, that he might be preſerved in the true Religion, and be acquainted with his whole Duty, and perform it accordingly: not imagining himſelf to be above all Laws, nor ſlighting his Subjects, but taking due Care to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their Happineſs.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Saul</hi> their firſt King, diſobeyed God, and diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded his Laws, and therefore the Kingdom was taken from his Family, and given to <hi>David,</hi> who was a ſtrict Obſerver of the Divine Laws (except in the Matter of <hi>Uriah,</hi> which Sin on his Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, God pardoned) and the Kingdom was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his Son <hi>Solomon.</hi> He, tho' highly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured of God, yet in ſundry Inſtances rebelled againſt him, and trampled on his Laws. For he not only gave himſelf up to the wanton Embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of many Women, but of many ſtrange Women, ſuch as were not Iſraelites by Nation or Profeſſion, but of idolatrous Nations, with whom the Lord had expreſly prohibited Iſrael in general, but more eſpecially their Kings, to contract Marriage; and by their Allurements, he was ſeduced to worſhip filthy and abominable Idols of the Neighbour Nations. And in Puniſhment of his Idolatry and Apoſtacy, God rent away ten Tribes from his Son <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> &amp; gave them to his Servant <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> the firſt Founder of the new &amp; diſtinct Kingdom of Iſrael. God ſays, <hi>Solomon's</hi> Son ſhall have one Tribe, for his Servant <hi>David'</hi>s ſake, and <hi>Jeruſalem'</hi>s ſake, which he had choſen. 1 Kin.

               <p>King <hi>Ahaz,</hi> the Father of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> was a very impious Prince, yet when the King of Iſrael and the King of Syria, were in a Confederacy to cut off the Royal Family of Judah, God remembred his ancient Promiſes to <hi>David,</hi> and ſent <hi>Iſaiah</hi> to aſſure him, that their evil Counſel ſhould not ſtand, or come to paſs. See <hi>Iſai. Ch.</hi> 7. <hi>ver.</hi> 3—7. The Houſe of <hi>David</hi> was exceedingly moved at that Time, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. God offers <hi>Ahaz</hi> a Sign (which he himſelf ſhould chuſe) of the Truth of what he had declared and promiſed, <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11. but <hi>Ahaz</hi> refuſed to aſk a Sign, becauſe he was in Deſpair, and diſbelieved God's Word, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon directs his Speech to the Royal Family in general, to comfort them under diſmal deſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Apprehenſions, and aſſures them that God's Promiſes to the Family of <hi>David,</hi> ſhould never fail, but ſhould have their full and final Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Meſſias, who ſhould be born of a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, <hi>ver.</hi> 13, 14. This Prophecy, concerning a Virgin's conceiving and bringing forth <hi>the Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel,</hi> (God with us) was now delivered to raiſe
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008135_0016_102E362EF24406D8"/>
and ſupport the drooping Spirits of the Houſe of <hi>David,</hi> who ſeeing ſo great a Force armed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, were under terrible Apprehenſions of their utter Extirpation near at Hand, from which this Prediction did relieve them, by giving Aſſurance, that their Houſe ſhould ſtand and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, 'till this promiſed <hi>Emanuel</hi> ſhould be born of their Race.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ahaz,</hi> inſtead of being reformed by the Mercy of God in breaking the Confederacy of the two Kings, became more wicked than he was before, for he cleaved to the worſt Abominations of the heathen Nations round about him. See 2 <hi>Chron. Ch.</hi> 28. <hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3, 4. And therefore God for his Puniſhment, brought upon him again the two confederated Kings, from whom he had delivered him the former Year, who made terrible Havock and Deſtruction. See <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6. and ſoon after the Land was invaded by the Edomites and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines, and expoſed to their Ravages. After all this he continued hardened in his Impiety, and would not ſeek to God, nor turn from his wicked Ways, but putting his Confidence in Man (and not in God) engaged the King of Aſſyria, by a ſacrilegious Preſent, to come for his Aſſiſtance, who rather diſtreſſed than helped him.</p>
               <p>After this, he gave himſelf up to Idolatry, and worſhipped the Gods of the Syrians, as well as of the other Nations, and filled Jeruſalem and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah with Idols, and their Altars.</p>
               <p>And upon the whole it is evident that the Reign of <hi>Ahaz</hi> was a moſt calamitous Time, and the People of Judah and Jeruſalem were in an evil State, and all Things conſidered, a more diſmal

               <p>Now in this gloomy and tempeſtuous Time, the <hi>Prophecy of my Text and Context</hi> is publiſhed by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> in the Name of the Lord, to ſupport the ſinking Spirits of his People, to raiſe in them a comfortable Hope, and to give them a joyful Proſpect of a Time ſoon to come, when God would graciouſly give them a religious and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous King and good Magiſtrates, under whoſe wiſe and juſt and mild Adminiſtration of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they ſhould have ſome Reſpite, and be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected and ſaved from the terrible Evils that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto had come upon them, and almoſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed them.</p>

And above all theſe Preparations for Defence, he put his Truſt in God, as appears by that excellent Speech <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

And God rewarded <hi>Hezekiah'</hi>s Piety and his religious Regard to the Law of God in his Adminiſtration of Government, with a proſperous Reign, and a very ſignal Deliverance from the violent Attempts of the Aſſyrians; for when the Army was on a full March towards Jeruſalem, with a Purpoſe to deſtroy the City &amp; Inhabitants, God ſent a terrible Deſtruction upon them, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 19. 35.</p>
               <p>And upon the whole, 'tis evident, that this pious and <hi>righteous Prince,</hi> under God, was a <hi>hiding Place from the Wind, a Covert from the Storm</hi> of War, and Devaſtation thereof, as refreſhing Waters to the thirſty, as a Shadow of Defence from the violent

and ſcorching Heat; a Protector &amp; Defender of his People from the deſtructive Evils, with which they were threatned.</p>
               <p>And this King of Judah is exhibited as a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of Piety and Juſtice, exerted for the Honour of God, and his Laws, and for the Safety &amp; Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the People under his Government: He is ſet forth as a Pattern, for the Imitation of all Chriſtian Kings. Religion, in the firſt Place, ought to be the Concern of every Chriſtian Prince. He that ruleth over Men, <hi>muſt rule in the Fear of God,</hi> 2 Sam. 23. 3. i. e. in the exact Obſervance of all the Divine Laws. And accordingly (as you have heard) Kings were enjoined to copy out the Law, and read therein all the Days of their Life, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 19.) that they might have a Senſe of Religion and Piety on their Hearts, and manifeſt it in their Practice. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was eminent for Piety towards God, and a zealous Regard to his Laws and Worſhip, and therefore he <hi>reigned in Righteouſneſs,</hi> and the <hi>Magiſtrates under Him,</hi> ruled <hi>in Judgment.</hi> His Eyes (as <hi>David'</hi>s) were upon the faithful of the Land, to dwell with him. i. e. to be of his Council, and he choſe them who were of a perfect Way, (i. e. honeſt &amp; upright) to ſerve him in the Adminiſtration of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. All good Kings are mindful of God and his ſacred Laws, and they think themſelves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to promote the religious Obſervance due thereunto.—It is the Province of Rulers to be Patrons of Religion, to be <hi>nurſing Fathers</hi> of the Church. And God is pleaſed to ſhower down his Bleſſings upon pious Princes, and He makes them great Benefactors to the People. A People

are ſafe and happy, by the Favour of Heaven, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Rulers who, above all Things, have a ſtrict and zealous Regard to the Honour of God and Obedience to his ſacred Inſtitutions.</p>
               <p>And now, having conſidered the primary Senſe of my Text, in Application to King <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> it follows,</p>
               <p>II. To ſhew, that there is alſo a <hi>ſecondary Senſe</hi> of the Words to be attended, for the fuller Illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Senſe</hi> is very evident in a great many Prophecies of the Old Teſtament. It is called a <hi>ſecondary Senſe,</hi> not as if it were leſs principally intended by the Prophets, but rather with Reſpect to the Time, becauſe it is the laſt and ultimate Completion of their Predictions: Which is alſo called the <hi>myſtical</hi> or <hi>figurative Senſe,</hi> by which is meant a more remote, but a natural and neceſſary Signification, in Contradiſtinction to the <hi>literal</hi> or immediate Signification, which is a Type or Figure of the other. "All Types or Figures being to have a Reſpect to the Things figured; if we conſider them as Figures, we ſpeak at the ſame Time of that which they repreſent; ſo that which is ſaid, has neceſſarily two proper and natural Senſes; one that agrees to the Figure, and another to the Thing figured: Sometimes the Figure is more evidently ſpoken of than the Thing figured, but ſometimes alſo ſuch Words are purpoſely choſen, as agree better to the Thing figured than the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, to ſhew that what is ſaid is but a Figure, and ought not to be reſted in.

               <p>"But tho' the chief Perſons, and principal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents of the old Teſtament are Figures, yet ſome are more evidently ſuch, and others more obſcure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; ſome are written only as Hiſtories, and left to be interpreted, and others are written ſo that we may plainly ſee they are but Figures, and their Relation naturally and neceſſarily carries the Mind to ſomething more lofty: Such are many of the Prophecies of the old Teſtament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Jeſus Chriſt, and his Church: They are capable of two Senſes, that of the Figure, and that of the Thing figured; this latter is not an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, but a proper and neceſſary Senſe, becauſe the Words themſelves ſhew that the Deſign of the Writer was to repreſent by a Figure ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more ſublime.

               <p>And of this Kind is the Prophecy of my Text and Context, which tho' <hi>primarily</hi> relating to <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah,</hi> and the Jewiſh Church and State, yet <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarily</hi> relates to Jeſus Chriſt, of whom that King was a Type; and tho' it might have, and hitherto has had a Fulfilment by ſeveral Steps and Degrees, ſince the Times of the Goſpel commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, (as I ſhall ſhew under the third general Head, when I ſhall conſider this Prophecy <hi>by Way of Accommodation</hi>) yet as I obſerved in my Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, this Prediction has never yet been ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled ſince the Coming of Chriſt in its ultimate and moſt ſublime Senſe, nor ſhall be, till the Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennial Period arrives.

               <p>And now let us ſee, how the Pagan Doctrine of <hi>Baalim</hi> and the Worſhip thereof is imitated by the Romiſh Church.</p>
               <p>The great Apoſtacy of the Chriſtian Church began in departing from the Faith, and giving heed to ſeducing Spirits and Doctrines of Devils, (Gr. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>As the Reign of Antichriſt began in <hi>Boniface</hi> the Third, Bp of <hi>Rome,</hi> whom, (with his Succeſſors) <hi>Phocas,</hi> Emperor of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> made Supreme Head of the Church, and univerſal Biſhop over all Churches whatſoever, <hi>A.D.</hi> 606, ſo his immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Succeſſor <hi>Boniface</hi> the 4th, in two or three Years after, by Leave from <hi>Phocas,</hi> opened the <hi>Pantheon</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> i. e. the <hi>Temple of Cybele, and all the Gods,</hi> and inſtead of the Pagan <hi>Deities,</hi> commanded the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and <hi>all Saints and Martyrs,</hi> to be worſhipped in that Temple, and conſecrated it for that Purpoſe.<note n="‖" place="bottom">

The Heathens generally worſhipped one ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme God, but with him they ſet up other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Gods, <hi>created Deities,</hi> whom they ſtiled <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> or <hi>Heroes;</hi> theſe were ſubordinate Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Mediators &amp; Interceſſors with the ſupreme God. This was the Worſhip of <hi>Baalim,</hi> which <hi>Ahaz</hi> introduced into his Kingdom, in his <hi>great Apoſtacy</hi> from the God of Iſrael, and his true Worſhip.</p>
               <p>So it is in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and this was the <hi>great Apoſtacy</hi> of the Chriſtian Church, when from being the Spouſe of Chriſt, ſhe was turned into a Harlot, being guilty of ſpiritual Adultery, even as Iſrael &amp; Judah. See <hi>Hoſ. Ch.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 2, 4, 5. Tho' the Papiſts acknowledge the One true God, yet they have introduced <hi>Angels and Saints,</hi> as <hi>the Objects of Worſhip,</hi> to whom they pray, and before whom they proſtrate themſelves, and pay religious Adoration, which is correſpondent to the <hi>Daemon-Worſhip</hi> of the Pagans.—It is worthy of Obſervation, that when <hi>Ahaz</hi> cauſed an <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Altar</hi> (in Form of <hi>Baalim'</hi>s Altar which he ſaw at <hi>Damaſcus</hi>) to be made and ſet up in the Place of the Altar of the Lord in the Temple, which he therefore cauſed to be removed. I ſay, when <hi>Ahaz</hi> did this, at the ſame Time he ſaid to <hi>Urijah,</hi> that the Brazen Altar (i.e. the Altar of the Lord) ſhould be for him to enquire by, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 16. 15. Tho' he made a ſolemn Injunction that all the public Sacrifices of what Sort ſoever they were, whether made by himſelf, or by the People, ſhould be conſtantly offered upon his Altar, which he calls the great Altar, (becauſe it was much bigger than the Altar of God) <hi>ver.</hi> 15. yet, he would
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:008135_0029_102E364EAA36AFB8"/>
not have it thought, that he intended wholly to lay aſide the Altar made by <hi>Solomon,</hi> but rather to do it great Honour, by reſerving it for his private Uſe, when he pleaſed to enquire of God, or at leaſt he pretended ſome Regard to it, tho' he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded it.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Bp <hi>Patrick'</hi>s Comment.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And this is the Language and Practice of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt;</hi> for the <hi>Pope of Rome</hi> cauſes <hi>Shrines and Altars</hi> to be made and ſet up for the <hi>Virgin Mary and the Saints,</hi> the Chriſtian, or rather Antichriſtian <hi>Baalim,</hi> and orders ſolemn and divine Adoration and Worſhip to be given unto them; and at the ſame Time pretends to have a religious Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for God and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; though hereby Chriſt is excluded his Office, as the one only Mediator between God and Man.—So the true Chriſtian Altar is removed, and the refined <hi>Altar of Baalim,</hi> with a <hi>Chriſtian Name</hi> is put in its Place. And as <hi>Ahaz</hi> in Conformity to the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,</hi> worſhipped the Syrian Gods in &amp; by <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>Statues</hi> or Idols, accounting <hi>them</hi> as Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Symbols of the Gods to whom divine Worſhip was paid, (for neither He nor the wiſer Heathens tho't theſe Images to be Gods, yet the worſhipping them, and the Gods in and by them is true <hi>Idolatry</hi>)—So the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who make and ſet up <hi>Images</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>the Virgin Mary</hi> and <hi>the Saints,</hi> and do not take theſe Images to be Gods, but only Repreſentations of them, and erected to their Honour, are nevertheleſs juſtly charged with Idolatry, becauſe they fall down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and pay religious Worſhip unto them. And thus it appears, that the Apoſtacy of <hi>Ahaz</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="unknown:008135_0030_102E3652126657A8"/>
from the true Worſhip of God to Idolatry, and the Worſhip of <hi>Baalim,</hi> was a Figure or Type of the great Apoſtacy of the Chriſtian Church to Antichriſtianiſm.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was a Type of Chriſt in one of the laſt and glorious Diſplays of his Regal Power and Office, when he ſhall throughly cleanſe the Chriſtian Church from all Antichriſtian Idolatries and Impurities.</p>
               <p>"Jeſus Chriſt, the true and eternal God, has an eſſential Kingdom, co-eternal with himſelf, and inſeparable from his Being.

Jeſus Chriſt has had ſuch a Kingdom on Earth, ſince his Aſcenſion into Heaven, but hitherto his viſible Kingdom has not had a large Spread upon the Earth.—"The Infidel Part of the World is very vaſt and large—The greateſt Kingdoms of the Earth are <hi>Tartary, India, China, Perſia</hi> and <hi>Turkey,</hi> which are Strangers to the Religion of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, except a ſmall Number in <hi>Turkey.</hi>—If we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the World into ſix Parts, we ſhall find that five of them know not Chriſt, but are either the ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Pagans (which are the greateſt Number) or Jews or Mahometans; and of the remaining ſixth Part, Popery hath ſpread it ſelf thro' the moſt flouriſhing Kingdoms of <hi>Europe,</hi> and has got Footing in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> and <hi>America;</hi> and among the Churches which diſown Popery, ſome are groſly ignorant, erroneous and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, as the Churches of <hi>Muſcovy, Abyſſnia</hi> (or <hi>Upper-Ethiopia</hi>) and thoſe called the <hi>Greek Churches,</hi> both in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Europe;</hi> ſo that they hardly deſerve the Name of <hi>Chriſtian Churches"</hi>—Not to ſpeak of the Ignorance, Infidelity, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy, &amp; Immorality that ſeems to cover the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Churches: So that the true Church of Chriſt is at this Day (as it has been in preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Times) a little Flock.—But if we look into the <hi>Prophecies</hi> of the Old Teſtament, we ſhall find <hi>they</hi> ſpeak of the vaſt Extent of Chriſt's viſible Kingdom on Earth, and ſeeing thoſe Prophecies have never yet been accompliſhed, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that there is a Time yet to come, before the Conſummation of all Things, wherein our Saviour will once more diſplay the glorious Banner of his Croſs, and like a mighty Man of War, march on

               <p>There are a great <hi>Number of Texts</hi> in <hi>Iſaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel,</hi> and the minor Prophets, which ſpeak of this univerſal Kingdom of the Meſſias.

Ch. 2. 34, 35. that <hi>the Stone cut out of the Mountain without Hands,</hi> (by which all agree the Kingdom of Chriſt is ſignified) <hi>ſhould become a great Mountain, and fill the whole Earth.</hi> And in Zech. 14. 9. 'tis ſaid, <hi>the Lord ſhall be King over all the Earth.</hi> But the moſt ſignal and renowned Place of Scripture, concerning the future glorious State of the Chriſtian Church on Earth, is in the New-Teſtament: Rev.

               </p>
               <p>That this happy Period is not paſt, we may ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy our ſelves, by conſidering, that from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Goſpel Times, to this Day, there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver has been <hi>a thouſand Years</hi> that deſerve the Name, or anſwer the Characters of this bleſſed <hi>Millennium.</hi>

Times of the Goſpel; <hi>For behold</hi> (ſays God) <hi>I create new Heavens and a new Earth,</hi> Ch. 65. 17. And again, Ch. 66. 22.—The <hi>new Heavens and the new Earth which I will make</hi>—And from him (not only <hi>Peter</hi>) but the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> borrows and uſes the ſame Metaphor of <hi>a new Heaven and a new Earth,</hi> (Rev. 21. 1.) in deſcribing the Millennium mentioned in the Beginning of the preceeding Chapter.</p>
               <p>This cannot be meant of the Church triumphant and State of the bleſſed in Heaven; for the <hi>new Heavens</hi> and <hi>the new Earth,</hi> ver. 1. are the ſame with <hi>the holy City, the new Jeruſalem,</hi> ver. 2. into which the Kings of the Earth bring their Glory and Honour, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. i. e. the gentile Kings being converted to Chriſtianity, ſhall come with all their honourable Retinue, to ſubmit to the Sceptre of Jeſus, to own themſelves his Subjects, and ambitious to be Members of this glorious Church on Earth.</p>
               <p>It is very evident, and I ſuppoſe univerſally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, that Jeruſalem the Metropolis of Judea, was a Type of the Chriſtian viſible Church (as the Temple and Sacrifices and other ceremonial Services thereof, were a Type of the pure Goſpel Service and Worſhip) and <hi>David</hi> under this Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, celebrates the Beauty and Glory of the Goſpel-Church in the latter Days, Pſal. 48. <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2.—<hi>The City of our God—beautiful for Situation, the Joy of the whole Earth, is Mount Sion, the City of the great King</hi>—i.e. <hi>the Chriſtian Church in her vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and glorious State, the City of Chriſt the great King.</hi> And in the Book of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> from Chap. 40th to the End of the Book, we have a Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription

of the Millennial State of the Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Church, repreſented under the Figure of the City of Jeruſalem and the Temple.</p>
               <p>The Prophet was in Viſion brought into the Land of Iſrael, and <hi>was ſet upon a very high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, by which was the Frame of a City</hi> on the South, i.e. on the South-Side of Mount Sion. He ſaw to the South ward of him, a Repreſentation of the City and Temple ſtanding upon an Eminence, And <hi>John'</hi>s Viſion of the new Jeruſalem (tho' it is to be obſerved there was no Temple there) is form'd upon the Plan of <hi>Ezekiel'</hi>s Viſion. See Rev. 21. 10, 11. <hi>And he carried me away in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to a great and high Mountain, and ſhewed me that great City, the holy Jeruſalem, deſcending out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from God, having the Glory of God.</hi> Now to prepare for this bleſſed State, the Lord Jeſus will come a ſecond Time, (not perſonally, but by his Spirit) with his Fan in his Hand, and will thro'ly purge the Floor of his viſible Church from all the Chaff of <hi>Superſtition,</hi> and <hi>Idolatry, Schiſm</hi> &amp; <hi>Hereſy, Irreligion</hi> &amp; <hi>Immorality,</hi> with which it is almoſt totally covered. And he ſhall be as a <hi>Refiner and Purifier of Silver, and he ſhall purify the Sons of Levi</hi> (the Miniſters of the Goſpel) <hi>and purge them as Gold and Silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an Offering in Righteouſneſs.</hi> See <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 3. At this Time, that moſt <hi>corrupt Faction of Chriſtians,</hi> or rather <hi>moſt wicked Cabal of Antichriſtians</hi> (called in Scripture the myſtical Babylon &amp; Antichriſt) ſhall be utterly broken, and the Kings &amp; Princes of the Nations (the ten Horns) who had before been Partakers with the Romiſh Church in its ſoul Impoſtures and Corruptions, will be turned

to hate the antichriſtian Whore, and ſhall make her deſolate and naked, and ſhall eat her Fleſh, and burn her with Fire, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 16.</p>
               <p>This is the happy Time when Antichriſt's <hi>Reign,</hi> i.e. <hi>domineering perſecuting Power</hi> ſhall come to an End, which (as it began A.D. 606, and muſt continue 1260 Years) is at 108 Years Diſtance from the preſent Time.

               <p>Then the Goſpel ſhall be preached to all the Nations of the Earth.—The Jews ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to Chriſt and gathered in, from all their Diſperſions, and the Fulneſs of the Gentiles ſhall come in with the Jews to the Chriſtian Church. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 25.—This is the Time ſpoken of by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> (Chap. 11. 9.) when the Earth ſhall be full of the Knowledge of the Lord, as the Waters cover the Sea. And when every thing that offends is taken out of the Way, the Earth ſhall be bleſſed with <hi>an univerſal Peace,</hi> which is clearly predicted by the evangelical Prophet, <hi>Iſai.</hi> Chap. 2. 4. <hi>Nation ſhall not lift up Sword againſt Nation, neither ſhall they learn War any more:</hi> Which peaceful State is alſo foretold in many other Places of the Prophets. <hi>Univerſal Righteouſneſs and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs</hi> ſhall be an Attendant of this laſt Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—<hi>Thy People ſhall be all righteous,</hi> ſays the Prophet, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 60. 21.

Religion ſhall appear in it's native Purity, the Influence of the holy Spirit on Men's Hearts, ſhall be conſpicuous in their Lives—then in a more eminent Manner, than ever before the bleſſed Jeſus ſhall be exalted and glorifyed. "In theſe bleſſed Days there ſhall be <hi>no new Religion,</hi> but <hi>new Hearts</hi>—Religion and Piety ſhall be in high Reputation, Goodneſs and Holineſs ſhall be eſteemed moſt honourable, all Perfidiouſneſs and Falſhood ſhall ceaſe and diſappear—Truth, Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,

               <p>This ſhall be the latter End of Chriſt's Kingdom on Earth. And this happy State of Things ſhall be enlivened and enlightned, tho' not with Chriſt's perſonal Preſence, yet with his Preſence by the Influence of his Spirit, in an high and very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common Meaſure; for ſo we read in the apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyptic Viſion, that upon the new Jeruſalem's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down from Heaven, a great Voice was heard ſaying, <hi>Behold the Tabernacle of God is with Men, and He will dwell with them; and they ſhall be his People, and God himſelf ſhall be with them and be their God."</hi>—By the powerful Aids of Heaven, Men ſhall be enabled to ſubdue their Luſts, to conquer their Vices, and with Exactneſs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their Lives to the Rules of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>"And as to the outward Means and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, God will make Uſe of to bring about this great Work on Earth, 'tis moſt reaſonable to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it ſhall be effected by <hi>active and zealous Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors.</hi> Perſons of that Character have been here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore raiſed up, in order to great Revolutions and Alterations in Church and State.

               <p>This pious King ordered the Prieſts to cleanſe the Sanctuary from all its idolatrous Pollutions—reſtored the Altar of the Lord to its Place; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved and deſtroyed the idolatrous Altars, and all Monuments of Idolatry; reſettled the Worſhip of God, according to the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> renewed the uſual Sacrifices, and cauſed the Paſſover to be kept with great Solemnity; reſettled the Courſes of the Prieſts and the Levites according to their Service; and in a Word, reſtored the ancient Worſhip in all its Order and Solemnity; a full Account of which we have in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> Chapters 29. 30, 31.

An Account of this we have in Rev. <hi>Ch.</hi>20. <hi>ver.</hi> 7, 8, 9. when <hi>the thouſand Years are expired, Satan ſhall be looſed out of his Priſon; and he ſhall go out to deceive the Nations which are in the four Quarters of the Earth,</hi> Gog &amp; Magog, <hi>to gather them together to Battle, the Number of whom is as the Sand of the Sea, and they went up on the Breadth of the Earth and compaſſed the Camp of the Saints about and the beloved City,</hi> i. e. the new Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.

               <p>But that <hi>Gog and Magog</hi> is quite different from <hi>this</hi> in Rev. 20. Ch.

               <p>But obſerve the tragical Cloſe of all—<hi>Fire came down from God out of Heaven, and devoured theſe Armies of Gog and Magog,</hi> ver. 9. All which is repreſented in Figure by <hi>Sennacherib'</hi>s Army, and the Deſtruction thereof.</p>
               <p>The Aſſyrian Army went up on the Breadth of the Land of Judea. The whole Hoſt came up againſt the City, and begirt it with a cloſe Siege, on Deſign to take and utterly deſtroy it, and the Inhabitants thereof. God had promiſed that the King of Aſſyria ſhould not poſſeſs himſelf of the City, nor ſo much as ſhoot an Arrow into it. See 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 19. 32. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 37, 33. and ſo it came to paſs.

1. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great, the firſt Chriſtian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, was eminently a King raiſed up by God, to perform wonderful Things for Chriſt and his Church, and to Him may our Text be applied and accommodated with an Emphaſis.</p>
               <p>The Chriſtian Church had been for above two Hundred Years aſſaulted and afflicted by the furious Storms, and ſcorching Heat of Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, raiſed by the Pagan Emperors, and proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Governors of the Provinces. The <hi>ten Perſecutions</hi> of the primitive Church are famous in Church Hiſtory. The <hi>tenth and laſt,</hi> began un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Diocleſian</hi> and <hi>Maximian</hi> A. D. 303, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued under ſome of their Succeſſors, was the moſt furious of them all, as well as of the longeſt Duration. In this diſmal Time, and moſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous State of the Church, God raiſed up <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> to be a Protector of his Church, againſt the Outrage of its Enemies, a Deliverer from her Agonies and Terrors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Son of <hi>Conſtantius Chlorus</hi> (Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of the weſtern Provinces) &amp; his Wife <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena</hi> a Britiſh Lady, was born in Britain.—As the firſt Chriſtian King in the World (<hi>Lucius</hi>) was a Briton, ſo was the firſt Chriſtian Emperor. "O happy <hi>Britain</hi> (ſays <hi>Eumenius Rhetor</hi> in an Oration to <hi>Conſtantine</hi>) and bleſſed above all other Lands, which didſt firſt behold <hi>Conſtantine Caeſar</hi>—And in another Oration—"Your Father <hi>Conſtantius</hi> did free the Britiſh Provinces from Slavery, and you have enobled them by taking thence your Original."—"<hi>Britons</hi> do juſtly boaſt of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> their Country-man, one among a thouſand and ten thouſands, who quenched the Fire, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned

               <p>No wonder that <hi>Britain</hi> is ambitious of having ſuch a Worthy born in her. This bleſſed Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, marching with his Army from <hi>Gaul</hi> to <hi>Italy,</hi> for the Suppreſſion of the wicked Uſurper. and moſt execrable Tyrant <hi>Maxentius,</hi> and for the Deliverance of the Romans from his horrid Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barities &amp; Debaucheries, as he was on his March, after Mid-day, had a wonderful Viſion: He ſaw in the Heavens a Pillar of Light in Figure like a Croſs, with an Inſcription thereon (in Greek Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters EN TOU Ω NIKA) In this overcome; and the Night following, Jeſus Chriſt appeared to him in his Sleep, and ordered him to make a Standard or Banner, like to that which appeared to him in the Heavens, and thereupon promiſed him Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and Victory over his Enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conſtantine</hi> according to the divine Command, made a Standard, and put upon it the Sign of the Croſs.—He gained an entire Victory over <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entius,</hi> and put the Standard, as a Trophy in the middle of <hi>Rome.</hi>—Being inſtructed in the Chriſtian Religion, he embraced it, &amp; made an open, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Profeſſion of Chriſtianity; and as a <hi>Nurſing Father of the Chriſtian Church,</hi> he made many Edicts in Favour of Chriſtians, &amp; the Chriſtian Religion.—He firſt granted to Chriſtians the free Exerciſe of their Religion, &amp; reſtored to them their Churches, and conferred many Priviledges on them: He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted all his Subjects to quit Paganiſm, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Religion of Jeſus Chriſt. He cauſed moſt of the Heathen Temples to be ſhut up, or thrown down, &amp; enacted Laws againſt the Heathen

Religion. He ordered magnificent Churches to be built, and endow'd them, and granted Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and Priviledges to the Clergy. He mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted a fervent &amp; unfeigned Love to Chriſt, and his Religion: He ſhewed extraordinary Kindneſs for the Chriſtian Church and the Miniſters of it, as became ſo great and good a Man: and ſo zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous was he in Chriſtianity, that his Palace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled a Church. He perſonally invited the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt to him, and his Palace, &amp; treated them with great Veneration and Honour; and by Deeds as well as Words, he gave them a moſt kind and courteous Reception. He made many Laws from Time to Time, for the Support and Emolument of the Church. He granted to all Clergymen and their Families, a Freedom from Taxes and Tribute; and in his Reign, and by his Example &amp; Encouragement, the Church was enriched by Gifts and Offerings. In his Reign the Church enjoyed Peace; and under the Laws of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> Chriſtians being freed from Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and perſecuting Powers, had a full and free Enjoyment of their civil Rights, and Chriſtian Liberties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conſtantine</hi> manifeſted a juſt Concern for the true Faith of the Goſpel, and the fundamental Doctrines of the Chriſtian Religion; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when <hi>Arius</hi> broached his damnable Hereſy, concerning Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God (<hi>viz.</hi> that there was a Time when the Son of God did not exiſt, that he was created out of Nothing, and is of a different Subſtance from the Father) <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> call'd a <hi>Council at Nice—the firſt General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi> compos'd of the Biſhops of the whole Roman

Empire Eaſt and Weſt. He honour'd this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil with his Preſence, and by his Authority &amp; Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, he preſerved Order and Peace.—This Council drew up a Creed (the famous <hi>Nicene Creed</hi>) in which it declared, that the Son of God was conſubſtantial with his Father; and ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematiz'd <hi>Arius</hi> and his Doctrine.</p>
               <p>And tho' <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was afterwards deceived into a good Opinion of <hi>Arius</hi> by the Jugglings, and Prevarications of that Heretick, and his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſans, yet he always adhered to the <hi>Omooúſian Faith</hi> declared by the Nicene Fathers, and deteſted the Doctrine of <hi>Arius</hi>—Thus <hi>Conſtantine</hi> reigned in Righteouſneſs—and his Mother <hi>Helena Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſta</hi> is celebrated by the Hiſtorians of thoſe Times,<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </note> for her eminent and unaffected Piety, Zeal for Chriſt and his holy Religion.—And as ſhe was rich in Faith, ſo in good Works—<hi>She was the liberal Soul, that deviſed liberal Things;</hi> and continued in Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality and Beneficence.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and his Mother <hi>Helena</hi> was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently fulfilled that Prediction of the Prophet, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 49. 23.—concerning the happy Times of the Goſpel, when Kings and Queens gave up their Names to Chriſt, &amp; ſupported the Church—<hi>And Kings ſhall be thy nurſing Fathers, and their Queens thy nurſing Mothers</hi>—It is very evident that this Prophecy was firſt remarkably accompliſhed in the Favours which <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and his Mother <hi>Helena</hi> ſhewed to the Church, and had a further Accompliſhment afterwards in other Emperors, Empreſſes, Kings and Queens.

He was famous for his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxy in Religion, and called the <hi>ſecond General Council, at Conſtantinople,</hi> againſt <hi>Macedonius,</hi> who denied the Divinity of the Holy Ghoſt.

Fifty-ſix ſet Battles he fought againſt the <hi>Danes</hi> by Sea and Land, and of theſe, eight in one Day: And by his miraculous Courage and Conduct, he ſo afflicted and worried his Enemies, tho' they came
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:008135_0052_102E368824D467E0"/>
in freſh Numbers upon him, that they were forced to give up what Hoſtages he demanded, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to ſuch Conditions as he thought fit to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe—And that theſe are no Flouriſhes, the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Conſent of Hiſtorians bears Witneſs: All celebrate him as an Heroe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by an unparallel'd Example tax him with no Vice.—And tho' <hi>Egbert</hi> is generally accounted the firſt Monarch of the Engliſh Saxons (our Anceſtors) yet in Truth, he only mark'd out or began what was perfected by his Grandſon <hi>Alfred.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was admirable in the Adminiſtration of Juſtice, wherein to relieve the poor &amp; diſtreſſed, he travelled Night and Day through his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; for beſides him, the People had in a Senſe no Protector. There was ſuch Partiality among the inferiour Judges of the Land, that the King was perpetually troubled with Appeals from their Deciſion of Cauſes, into which he ſo diligently enquired, that all Villany was ever bro't to Light. If he found his Judges unſkilful, he gravely admoniſhed them, and in Caſe they did not improve in Knowlege of Juſtice, they were to loſe their Places.</p>
               <p>The King himſelf being the ſuperiour Judge (not only as to Authority but Adminiſtration of Juſtice) took Care that his People ſhould be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with able Miniſters: He alſo provided them with good Laws, and for the better Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the whole Engliſh Nation, brought up ſeveral laudable Cuſtoms, which continue to this Day.</p>

As to his Learning, he was the Wonder of his Age—He had a vehement Deſire after Knowlege: and by reading Night and Day, or hearing ſome learned Men, he had a thoro' Knowlege of Books, and ſuch Improvement did he make, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came an excellent Grammarian, Philoſopher, Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torician, Hiſtorian, Muſician, &amp; Poet: And he was a perfect Architect, and Geometrician; and that Learning might flouriſh in the Land, he laid a Foundation for the Improvement thereof among his People: He founded a School at <hi>Oxford</hi> (ſince a famous Univerſity) for training up Youth in the liberal Arts, and endow'd it with a Part of his Revenue.</p>
               <p>As to Religion, he excell'd more than in Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He made a Vow to dedicate to God, in ſolemn Meditation &amp; Prayer, the one half of his Time, except the Time of Sleep and neceſſary Refreſhments.</p>

               <p>As he was reputed an Oracle in his Time, ſo his Parliament was treated by him as his Oracle, for in all Matters of Importance, he would aſk their Advice, and he ſometimes put even his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative into their Hands; which is to me an Evidence of his great Wiſdom. The City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> was his Paradiſe, for what good Fortune ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever befell him, he tho't he enjoy'd it not, 'till the Citizens were made acquainted therewith.—He reigned in Righteouſneſs, and to <hi>England</hi> he was eminently as a hiding Place from the Wind, a Covert from the Storm, as Rivers of refreſhing Waters, and as the Shadow of a great Rock in a weary Land.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>The firſt Criſis</hi> was—when <hi>Charles</hi> 5th. Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of <hi>Germany,</hi> by defeating <hi>John</hi> Duke of Saxony, and the Landgrave of Heſſe, and getting them into his Hands, had ſubdued the <hi>Smalcaldick League,</hi> in which the Strength of the Proteſtants did then conſiſt: upon that Defeat all ſubmitted to the Emperor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maurice</hi> now made Elector of Saxony, at the Head of the Imperial Army, at laſt reſolved not to ſee the Ruin of Religion, &amp; Liberty, fell ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly and unexpectedly with his Forces upon the Emperor, that he was very near having ſurprized and taken him at <hi>Inſpruck,</hi> and ſo overturned all that Deſign, upon which the Emperor had been labouring for many Years, <hi>viz.</hi> deſtroying the Proteſtant Religion and Liberties—This brought on the Treaty of <hi>Paſſau,</hi> and a Peace thereupon between the Emperor, and the Proteſtant Princes and States, whereby the free Exerciſe of Religion was ſecured to the Proteſtants; and ſo that Criſis paſſed over.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>"The ſecond Criſis</hi> was towards the End of the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> when the Proteſtant Religion ſeemed almoſt extinguiſhed in <hi>England,</hi> and the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> chief Miniſter of <hi>France,</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Granvel</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> deſigned a Peace between the two Crowns, that their Maſters

But after they had form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Scheme, Queen <hi>Mary</hi> died, and was ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> and ſoon after that the French King was accidentally kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and that Kingdom fell under a long Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of a Minority, viz. <hi>Charles</hi> the 9th, and a civil War on Account of Religion; and the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands felt from thence and from Queen <hi>Eliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abeth,</hi> ſuch Encouragement that they made the longeſt and braveſt Reſiſtance againſt the Power of <hi>Philip,</hi> that is to be found in all Hiſtory; and the Criſis ended."</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Third Criſis</hi> of the Reformation began in 1585, and laſted three Years.—The Catholic League (ſo called) of the Papiſts in <hi>France,</hi> was fomidable for a Time to the Proteſtants; the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> was victorious in the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands; the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was murdered, and the States fell under great Diſtractions, &amp; <hi>Spain</hi> entred into a Deſign of invading <hi>England,</hi> &amp; dethroning Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and putting the Queen of Scots in her Stead: In order to that, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was for ſome Years preparing the greateſt Fleet that the World had ever ſeen, which came to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Invincible Armada;</hi> and with the Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment &amp; Ruin of that Fleet, this Criſis went off.</p>

               <p>And the <hi>Fifth Criſis</hi> which I touched before, began in 1672, when <hi>Louis</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated to ſwallow up the united Provinces, to maſter <hi>England,</hi> to demoliſh Proteſtantiſm both in <hi>England</hi> &amp; <hi>Holland,</hi> to pave the Way for the Extirpation of that Religion through all <hi>Europe,</hi> and for eſtabliſhing Popery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Criſis,</hi> as I ſaid, continued in Agitation forty Years—The glorious <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> broke <hi>Louis'</hi>s-Meaſures, and overturned his Schemes for that Time; yet not many Years after, the <hi>Criſis</hi> roſe again, <hi>viz.</hi> in 1685; when <hi>Louis</hi> recalled, and vacated the Edict of Toleration of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, as he had been for many Years before weakning the Proteſtant Intereſt in <hi>France,</hi> to prepare for this fatal Stroke.</p>
               <p>"The Year <hi>Eighty-five,</hi> muſt ever be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred as the moſt fatal to the Proteſtant Religion. In <hi>February</hi> King <hi>James</hi> II. of <hi>England</hi> declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Papiſt, and went openly to Maſs. In <hi>June Charles</hi> the Elector Palatine (Grandſon of <hi>Fredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>) whoſe Father <hi>Charles Louis</hi> had been reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Lower Palatinate &amp; Electoral Dignity) dying without Iſſue, the Electoral Dignity went to the Houſe of <hi>Newburg,</hi> a moſt bigotted popiſh Family.</p>
               <p>In <hi>October</hi> the King of <hi>France</hi> recalled the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> and in <hi>December</hi> the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> by the Perſwaſions or Threats of the Court of

                  <hi>France,</hi> recalled the Edict that his Father had granted to the <hi>Vaudois;</hi> ſo it muſt be confeſſed, that this was a very critical Year. And at this Time was the Height of the Fifth great Criſis of the Proteſtant Religion in the Opinion of Biſhop <hi>Burnet."</hi>

               </p>
               <p>"The King of <hi>France</hi> let looſe ſome Bodies of Dragoons to live upon the Proteſtants at Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, who were put under no Reſtraints, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting Rapes and Murder.

               <p>"Men and Women who would not yield, were not only ſtrip'd of all they had, but kept long from Sleep, and driven about from Place to Place.

Multitudes of Proteſtants were baniſhed the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by publick Edict, and great Numbers were chained to the Gallies, and the publick Exerciſe of the Proteſtant Religion ſuppreſs'd throughout all his Dominions—And upon the whole, here was one of the moſt violent Perſecutions that is to be found in Hiſtory, and has been compared to the Tenth Perſecution of the Primitive Church, under <hi>Diocleſian."</hi>

But to return,</p>
               <p>Popery ſoon grew rampant in our Nation, and King <hi>James</hi> proceeded with an uncommon Zeal and Application to advance the Roman Intereſt; <hi>Britain</hi> was then in greater Danger than ever before; the King being in League with <hi>Louis,</hi> and having one of his own Kingdoms of his own Religion—The Forts and Caſtles were in the Hands of Papiſts, and the Army under popiſh Officers. The Romiſh Worſhip was ſet up in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Places of the Nation, and even in its great Metropolis, <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> thoſe Frogs of the Myſtical Egypt (<hi>Father Petre</hi> and his croaking Company) were in the King's Chambers: Monks &amp; Fryars appeared publickly in their Habits: The Engliſh Laws were trampled upon, and <hi>England</hi> was ſtrip'd of their Rights and Immunities.—In a Word, Hell &amp; Rome were Day &amp; Night at work to add the finiſhing Stroke, to what had been ſo long contriving.</p>
               <p>For the Succour of the moſt diſtreſſed and affrighted Nation, God raiſed up a Deliverer, <hi>this glorious Prince of Orange,</hi> and in Conſequence of his Expedition to <hi>England,</hi>—King <hi>James'</hi>s Abdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation

—the ſetting the Crown on the Head of the Prince and Princeſs of <hi>Orange;</hi> and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Nations were for that Time ſaved from Popery and Slavery.</p>
               <p>But <hi>the Criſis</hi> roſe again in the Beginning of this Century.</p>
               <p>In 1700, the abdicated King <hi>James</hi> died in <hi>France,</hi> and the French King cauſed the pretended Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> to be proclaimed with great Solemnity, King of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and therein his Deſign was evident enough.</p>
               <p>And a little after in the ſame Year <hi>Charles</hi> the Second of <hi>Spain</hi> died (without Iſſue) and by his Will (real or forged) the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> ſecond Son of the Dauphin was made his Succeſſor to the whole Spaniſh Monarchy, contrary to the Treaty of Partition: And upon his declaring that he accepted of the Will, he was proclaimed, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted and treated as King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and thereupon he went to <hi>Spain,</hi> and took Poſſeſſion of his new Kingdom.</p>
               <p>And immediately French Troops were ſent to take Poſſeſſion of the Spaniſh Netherlands. This unexpected Event threw a dark Cloud over the Face of Affairs in <hi>Europe. France</hi> was now poſſeſs'd not only of the Netherlands, but of the whole Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Monarchy too, &amp; therewith of all the Riches of <hi>America.</hi>—And the Scheme of <hi>Louis</hi> for an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Empire, and the Extirpation of what he call'd the Northern Hereſy was again viſible in erecting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>England</hi> was diſarm'd and divided; <hi>Holland</hi> was encompaſſed by the French Power; the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was weak, becauſe disjointed, and the Affairs

of Chriſtendom were brought to as dangerous a Criſis, as could eaſily be imagined.</p>
               <p>The vigilant King <hi>William</hi> was active &amp; buſy in oppoſing the Deſigns of <hi>France,</hi> and perfected an Alliance between the Emperor, England and Holland, and before his Death projected the <hi>whole Scheme of the War,</hi> that became abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the Preſervation of Europe: And 'tis well known, that in the Reign of Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> by the wonderful Succeſs of the Arms of the Allies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the valiant <hi>Eugene</hi> and <hi>Marlborough,</hi> that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring Monarch <hi>Louis</hi> 14th, was humbled &amp; bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken—And that long Criſis came to a full Period, at the Death of <hi>Louis</hi> 14th; and when the great Elector of <hi>Hanover</hi> ſat on the Britiſh Throne.</p>
               <p>The Appearance of King GEORGE, as of the Sun in his Strength inſtantly diſpell'd the Miſts, ſcattered the Clouds, and diſſipated the gloomy Terrors, and filled the Hearts of true Proteſtant <hi>Britons</hi> with Joy, <hi>as the Light of the Morning when the Sun riſeth, even a Morning without clouds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>King GEORGE I.

of that Nation by Divine Inſtitution wholly ceaſed, when its national State was utterly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and their Commonwealth demoliſhed—Nor has Jeſus Chriſt the mediatorial King left any deſigned Plan or Model for the political Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſtian Nations—Nor doth God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf name and appoint the Perſon who ſhall hold the Sceptre, in any Nation of the World, as he did to the Iſraelitiſh Nation in the Perſons of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and others afterwards; nor has God appointed any particular Perſons, in any Nation, to make civil or municipal Laws or Statutes; nor has he named, nor does he name the Judges that are to interpret the Laws, and put them in Execution; and yet the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, that <hi>there is NO Power but of God, the Powers that be, are ordained of God,</hi> Rom. 13. 1.—"The Powers he there ſpeaks of muſt be the Roman Emperors, and thoſe that rul'd under them; for he wrote in that Time, when <hi>Rome</hi> was the Miſtreſs of the World, and to Chriſtians living in the Metropolis, <hi>Rome</hi> herſelf."—"Now the Roman Emperors then in Being were not in ſtrictneſs of Speech ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God, but were elected by the Roman Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or choſen and confirmed by the Senate." And hence Dr. <hi>Whitby</hi> (on that Text) makes this clear Inference, "That an immediate Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Deſignation of the Perſon by God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be neceſſary, to render any Prince, God's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance"—"And though it be granted that God has made a general Appointment or Ordinance, in the fifth Commandment, or by a Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, requiring that all Nations ſhould have ſome Government placed over them, yet no individual

Perſon can claim a Right, to be the higher Power in any Nation, more than others, nor are the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by it, tied to yield Obedience to this Man, more than that—This therefore cannot be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to make a Man the individual Perſon, who is God's Ordinance, in Reference to ſuch a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—It remains therefore that this Authority be conveyed to this or that individual Perſon or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, by Compact, Conſent or Choice of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons governed, that ſuch a Perſon or Family ſhall have the ſupreme Authority in ſuch Nation.

               <p>(1.) Let us thankfully obſerve the diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Favour of Heaven to our Nation and Land, in ordaining for them ſo happy a Conſtitution of civil Government, ſo well adapted to anſwer the Ends of the Magiſtracy.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>"The grand northern Hive, (from which have iſſued thoſe mighty Swarms of Goths, Vandals, Saxons, Angles, Franks, Huns, Danes and Normans, which ſubdued all the weſtern Parts of <hi>Europe</hi>) has been ſtil'd by ſome Authors <hi>Officina Gentium,</hi> the Shop of the Nations; and might with as much Juſtice have been called <hi>Officina Libertatis,</hi> the Shop of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. For wherever thoſe People ſettled, they eſtabliſhed a Government of Liberty, and ſhewed themſelves to be greater Maſters of the great Secret of <hi>governing ALL by ALL,</hi> than thoſe Nations that had given them the opprobrious Name of <hi>Barbarous;</hi> and as they were all Joint-Adventurers in their military Expeditions, ſo all had a Share in their ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Government, and the Lands they conquered. For they choſe their General and great Officers, to conduct them in the War (which great Officers were a Council of War to the Generals in leſſer Matters, but in Affairs of greater Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, they aſſembled the whole Army, and conſulted with all the Soldiers or People under their Command. When they came to be ſettled in Peace, the Lands of the conquered Country were divided; the General had his Share, the Officers their's, and the Soldiers or People their's. The General became their Prince, and when he died, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was choſen to ſucceed him by a general Election. The great Officers were now his <hi>Council of State</hi> in leſſer Matters, as they had been before, <hi>his Council of War;</hi> but in great Affairs, and Matters of Weight relating to the Publick, all the People were aſſembled, and adviſed with in the Manner they had been during their military Expedition. The Shares of Lands given to the Officers were afterwards called Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and thoſe given to the Soldiers, Feuda, or Fees.</p>
                     <p>Wherever theſe northern Nations ſettled, they eſtabliſhed a Government, framed out of Monarchy, Ariſtocracy, and Democracy. <hi>France, Spain, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Britain,</hi> had all this Sort of Government, which is no other than a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Monarchy, tho' <hi>Britain</hi> is the only Nation in the World that ſtill retains it. The Founder of this incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Sort of Government very well knew, that Monarchy, when corrupted, degenerates into Tyranny; that Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy, (i.e. The Government of the Nobles) being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, turns into an Oligarchy; (i.e. Government by a few, or a ſmall Number) and that Democracy (i.e. the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the People) was liable to Tumults and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: and therefore to avoid the Danger, that might ariſe from either of them ſeparately, compoſed the moſt exact Scheme of Government out of them all, and which in our Language is called King, Lords and Commons. Each of theſe have their proper Spheres to move in, and whilſt they continue within them, the Government is eaſy, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution ſafe; but if the Motion of any one of them inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feres with that of the other, the whole Frame is out of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the Conſtitution immediately falls into Convulſions, and without wiſe and ſpeedy Applications, muſt expire in an Apoplexy.—In the happy Iſland of <hi>Britain,</hi> which well deſerves the glorious Name of the <hi>Capital of Liberty,</hi> the Property of the meaneſt Subject is ſo ſtrongly guarded by Law, that a moderate Fortune here is infinitely more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable than the higheſt Honours, and greateſt Riches, a Subject is capable of attaining in any Country of the World, where the Will of the Prince, (and not the Safety of the People) is the ſupreme Law.—</p>
                     <p>—But though in <hi>Great Britain</hi> only, the ancient, generous and manly Government of <hi>Europe</hi> ſurvives and continues in its original Luſtre &amp; Perfection, and is a moſt exact Scheme of Politicks; yet it may be endangered by any one of the Branches of the Conſtitution invading the Province of the other. And if hereafter this Nation ſhould ſo far loſe its Virtue, as to have its Lords and Commons become baſely ſervile and mercenary, there will not be wanting evil Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, who will adviſe the Prince to lay hold of the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to purchaſe from them their Liberty, and bribe them into Slavery."</p>

Power, in Imitation and according to the Pattern of <hi>Louis</hi> 14th of <hi>France,</hi> and therewith to bring in the popiſh Religion, ſo well calculated for an Agreement with arbitrary Power in the State, under a Prince wholly Jeſuited, and under the Influence of Bigotry to the Romiſh Principles almoſt without a Parallel.</p>
               <p>But lo! in the midſt of Diſtreſs and Perplexity of the Britiſh People, God raiſed up a Deliverer, the <hi>Prince of Orange,</hi> afterwards the glorious King WILLIAM, the great Reſtorer of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Conſtitution, and under God their Saviour from Slavery and Popery.</p>

And the Nation being recovered to a State of Freedom, did by their Parliaments make uſe of their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to make ſuch other Laws, and take ſuch other Methods as were moſt proper to preſerve them from ſuch Dangers in Times to come. "And moreover the Nations were delivered from a Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Popery, that ſtuck ſo long to them, <hi>viz.</hi> Perſecution of proteſtant Diſſenters, <hi>by the Act of Toleration,</hi> which ſtill ſubſiſts, and God grant it ever may continue in full Force, according to the true Intent &amp; Meaning thereof, whereby all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants are at Liberty to worſhip God, according as they are perſwaded in their Conſcience is moſt agreable to his Will, without fear of being ruin'd in their Perſons or Eſtates by any Faction promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereunto by the Court, and without Hazard of having any Party of Proteſtants join with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts to overthrow the eſtabliſhed Church for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Intereſt."

               <p>Mr. <hi>Dummer</hi> will be remember'd in the Land, for his moſt prudent, righteous and mild Conduct of the public Affairs, ſo happy for the Province, and ſo pleaſing to the People.—He retired from the Government to a private Life, with a Temper and Behaviour ſo ſuitable to a Soul that is raiſed above the World, and the Honours of it, to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Contemplation on heavenly Glories.—In his advanced Age, he has the Comfort in Reflection of having ſerved his GOD, his King &amp; his Country, with Integrity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="unknown:008135_0088_102E36E41E0C42C0"/>
We cannot be unmindful of the Smiles from the Throne in the Appointment of ſo diſtinguiſh'd and accompliſh'd Gentlemen as Mr. <hi>Addington,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Willard,</hi> to the very important Place of Secretary.—Mr. Secretary <hi>Addington</hi> was famous in his Day for Wiſdom, Probity and Fidelity in the diſcharge of the public Truſt.—And the Name of Mr. Secretary <hi>Willard (the good Secretary)</hi> is as the moſt fragrant Ointment. The Fame of his good Deeds, his long and ſaithful public Services, remains after he is dead, and he will live in a good Report.—His Continuance in the Secretary's Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice forty Years, and in all that Time managing the Affairs under his Care, not only without Error and Fault, but with univerſal Applauſe, is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Precedent, and cannot but raiſe our Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>He was a Chriſtian of a true primitive Spirit, <hi>an Iſraelite indeed, without Guile,</hi> and a ſhining Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Piety and Virtue. This excellent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God is deceaſed—and is it not our Duty to embalm his precious Memory? And can thoſe who for many Years were acquainted with his eminent Graces and moral Endowments, refrain dropping a Tear on his Grave?—<hi>O Boſton!</hi> thy Beauty is faded—the Lord hath taken from thee—the <hi>Judge, the Prudent,</hi> and <hi>the Ancient, the Honourable Man,</hi> and <hi>the Councellor</hi>—Help Lord, for the godly Man ceaſeth—and where is <hi>the Man</hi> to be found among you <hi>to ſtand in the Gap?</hi>—Bleſſed be God, our Eyes ſee one of a like Spirit, Piety and pure Converſation, by Royal Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>repairing the public Breach.</hi>—And Mr. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary <hi>Oliver</hi> excelling in Prudence, Uprightneſs,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:008135_0089_102E36E5E5F49938"/>
and unblemiſh'd Virtue, will obtain the juſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of his faithful public Services.</p>
               <p>But to return from this Digreſſion, for which I aſk Pardon, if I have offended.</p>
               <p>As we have in Times preceeding been happy under wiſe and good Governours, ſo we hope to be thus happy in Times coming.—</p>
               <p>Our good and gracious KING has given us a freſh Mark of his Royal Favour, in appointing Mr. POWNALL to the chief Seat of Government, at ſuch a Day as this.—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Excellency</hi> in your great Goodneſs, will permit me on this public Occaſion &amp; Solemnity, to congratulate <hi>you</hi> as the <hi>chief Prince</hi> among the Princes of the Province, truſting in God, that you will <hi>rule in Judgment</hi> under King GEORGE, <hi>who reigns in Righteouſneſs</hi>—that under GOD <hi>and the</hi> KING, you will be <hi>as a hiding Place, and a Refuge from the Storm,</hi> in the preſent <hi>tumultuous and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous State—as Rivers of Waters in a dry Place, as the Shadow of a great Rock in a weary Land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We render our hearty Thanks to God the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Governor among the Nations, that he has directed the KING to a Gentleman of ſo great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity for Government.—Though with the aged, by long Experience, there is Wiſdom; yet God giveth to the young Man alſo, Knowlege &amp; Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—<hi>Elihu,</hi> though inferior in Years to <hi>Job and his three Friends,</hi> yet appeared much ſuperior to them all in Underſtanding, in a right Knowlege of God, his Attributes, Providence and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World:—And we hope the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:008135_0090_102E36E952B7DEC0"/>
of an <hi>Elihu</hi> will appear in all your pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Conduct.</p>
               <p>All civiliz'd Nations and Countries have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed their Senſe of this; that Governors and Men in Authority ought to be Men of good Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity and Knowlege.—When our Saxon An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors gave the Name of <hi>Koning</hi> (by Contraction <hi>King</hi>) that is, <hi>a wiſe Man,</hi> to their <hi>ſupreme Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,</hi> they taught us, what was a neceſſary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in crowned Heads, which is alſo a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Qualification in Governors &amp; Magiſtrates un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them.—The Emperor <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> (An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus Philoſophus) had very often in his Mouth that Saying of the great Philoſopher <hi>Plato,</hi> that <hi>then indeed Common-wealths would flouriſh, when Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers reigned, when Rulers were ſkilled in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Jul. Capitolin.</note> Such an one was <hi>Marcus</hi> himſelf, and ſuch was the Character of ſome of his Predeceſſors, as <hi>Auguſtus, Titus, Adrian,</hi> and <hi>Alexander Severus.</hi> And ſome of his Succeſſors, <hi>Conſtantine the Great</hi> (as appears by his very learned Oration to the Convention of the Saints) and <hi>Theodoſius the Elder,</hi> and <hi>Charles the Great</hi>—all good Rulers, as well as learned Princes.—And therefore may we not hope for great Felicities under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of a Gentleman of <hi>polite Literature, ſkill'd in the liberal Arts, and a Philoſopher.</hi>—We are perſwaded ſuch an one will favour Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſmile upon Men of that Character.</p>
               <p>The Character of a true Philoſopher takes in religious Endowments, &amp; moral Virtues, in which we ſhall behold you no common Example—And
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:008135_0091_102DCFD684FCEAA0"/>
a generous public Spirit is alſo a conſtant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of true Philoſophy—and therefore we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, you will aim at the common Good and eſpouſe the public Weal.—The true Philoſopher prefers the Advantages of the Community, before his private Intereſt.</p>
