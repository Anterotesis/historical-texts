            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>"AS the people of England cannot be bound by any law, without the conſent of their repreſentatives firſt had in parliament; ſo neither can any En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhman ſuffer in his perſon, or eſtate, for the breach of any laws, or for any real, or pretended crime, without the conſent of the people firſt had by a jury of his peers, or equals:" therefore,</p>
            <p>It can never be unſeaſonable to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, or to remind. Jurors of their duty; becauſe they are the perſons, on whom the property, the liberty, and the lives of their fellow-ſubjects de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend. When queſtions, however, which relate to the national liberty of the people, are agitated in the courts of juſtice; it becomes of the utmoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, that thoſe who ſerve upon Juries ſhould be acquainted with their <hi>duties.</hi> For, if Juries are deſtitute of the inſtructions neceſſary upon theſe
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:012414_0004_0F8997AAD29EF7C0"/>occaſions, we muſt not expect that they will exert themſelves with ſpirit: while they remain ignorant of the nature of their ſtation, it is impoſſible that they ſhould feel its impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>Men of great eminence in the law have publicly declared, that encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have lately been made upon the <hi>rights</hi> of Juries. To enquire into the truth of this charge is of the utmoſt conſequence, not only to Jurors, but to the whole body of the people; as there is no man who may not, directly, or indirectly, be affected by theſe invaſions. Indeed, the good intentions and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of Jurymen will avail little to the ſecurity of the nation, if they are <hi>fraudulently,</hi> or <hi>forcibly,</hi> prevented from diſcharging the <hi>duties</hi> of their <hi>office.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A knowledge, therefore, of whatever relates to the office of Juries, ſeems at this time eſſentially neceſſary; ſince from hence alone can ariſe the proper <hi>execution</hi> of its <hi>duties,</hi> and the <hi>preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
               <pb n="vii" facs="unknown:012414_0004_0F8997AAD29EF7C0"/>of its <hi>rights.</hi>—To promote theſe purpoſes, the following little pamphlet is now republiſhed. Its character for perſpicuity, and ſtrength of reaſoning, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT to the READER.</head>
            <p>THIS treatiſe has paſſed through many editions. It appeared firſt in the year 1680; it was reprinted in the year 1731, &amp; again in 1763, 1764, 1770 and 1771; and is now preſented to the public at leaſt for the ſeventh time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>N. B.</hi> Many circumſtances might lead the reader to ſuſpect, that this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogue has been altered in order to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate it to the preſent times. This edition, however, has been care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully collated with the <hi>firſt,</hi> which was printed in London for Richard Janeway, in Queen's Head Alley, Pater-noſter-Row, in the year 1680: and ſo ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulouſly has the Original been adhered to, that not a ſingle word has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, except in the tranſlation of the Latin ſentences in page 3, the latter of which was before unintelligible. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, indeed, have been taken with the orthography, and pointing; but theſe have not in the leaſt affected the ſenſe.</p>

               <speaker>Jurym.</speaker>
               <p>I am ſummoned to appear <hi>upon a Jury,</hi> and was juſt going to try if I could get off. Now I doubt not but you can put me into the beſt way to obtain that favour.</p>

There are others <hi>better ſkilled</hi> in ſuch matters.

               <p>As for your time and trouble, it is not <hi>much;</hi> and however, can it be better ſpent than in doing <hi>juſtice,</hi> and ſerving your country? to withdraw yourſelf in ſuch caſes, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For the office of a <hi>Juryman</hi> is, <hi>conſcientiouſly to judge his neighbour;</hi> and needs no more <hi>law</hi> than is eaſily learnt to direct him therein. I look upon you therefore as a man well qualified with <hi>eſtate, diſcretion, &amp; integrity;</hi> and if all ſuch as you ſhould uſe private means to avoid it, how would the king and country be honeſtly ſerved? At that rate we ſhould have none but <hi>fools</hi> or <hi>knaves</hi> entruſted in this grand concern, on which (as you well obſerve) the lives, liberties, and eſtates of all <hi>England</hi> depend.</p>
               <p>Your <hi>tenderneſs</hi> not to be acceſſary to any man's being wronged or ruined, is (as I ſaid) much to be commended. But may you not incur it unawares, by ſeeking thus to avoid it? <hi>Pilate</hi> was not inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent becauſe he waſhed his hands, and ſaid, <hi>He would have nothing to do with the blood of that juſt one.</hi> There are faults of <hi>omiſſion</hi> as well as <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</hi> When you are <hi>legally called</hi> to try ſuch a cauſe, if you ſhall <hi>ſhuffle</hi> out yourſelf, and thereby perſons perhaps <hi>leſs conſcientious</hi> happen to be made uſe of, and ſo a <hi>villain</hi> eſcapes juſtice, or an <hi>innocent</hi> man is ruined, by a <hi>prepoſſeſſed</hi> or <hi>negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent</hi> verdict; can you think yourſelf in ſuch a caſe wholly blameleſs? <hi>Qui non prohibet cum po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, jubet: That man abets an evil, who prevents it not, when it is in his power.

               <p>Truly, I think a man is bound to <hi>do all the good</hi> he can, eſpecially when he is lawfully called to it. But there ſometimes happen <hi>nice caſes,</hi> wherein it may be difficult to diſcharge one's conſcience without incurring the <hi>diſpleaſure</hi> of the court, and thence <hi>trouble</hi> and <hi>damage</hi> may ariſe.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is falſe:</hi> For, though the direction, as to matter of law ſeparately, may belong to the judge, and the finding the matter of fact does, peculiarly, belong to the Jury; <hi>yet muſt your Jury alſo</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply matter of fact and law together; <hi>and from their conſideration of, and a right judgment</hi> upon both, <hi>bring forth their verdict:</hi> For do we not ſee in moſt general iſſues, as upon <hi>not guilty</hi>— pleaded in <hi>treſpaſs,</hi> breach of the peace, or <hi>felony,</hi> though it be matter <hi>in law</hi> whether the party be a <hi>treſpaſſer,</hi> a breaker of the peace, or a <hi>felon;</hi> yet the Jury do not find the <hi>fact</hi> of the caſe by it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, leaving the law to the court; but find the party <hi>guilty,</hi> or <hi>not guilty,</hi> generally? So as, though they anſwer not to the queſtion ſingly, <hi>what is law?</hi> yet they determine the law, in all matters, where iſſue is joined. So likewiſe is it not every day's practice, that when perſons are indicted for <hi>murther,</hi> the Jury not only find them <hi>guilty,</hi> or <hi>not guilty;</hi> but many times, upon hearing, and

And why? <hi>Quia Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni judicium eſt,</hi> The judgment is God's. Mark this ſaying, thou proud judge; the devil will bring this ſentence againſt thee at the day of doom. Hell will be full of theſe judges, if they repent not, and amend: they are worſe than the wicked judge that Chriſt ſpeaketh of, <hi>Luke</hi> the 19th, that neither feared God nor the world.

               <p>Your ſervant, Sir! under favour of your mighty wiſdom, &amp; experience, when I ſaid no judge <hi>could do it,</hi> I ſpake the more like a <hi>Barriſter;</hi> for it is a maxim in law—<hi>Id poſſumus, quod Jure poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumus;</hi> a man is ſaid to be <hi>able</hi> to do only ſo much, as he may <hi>lawfully do.</hi> But ſuch fining, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoning, cannot <hi>lawfully</hi> be done; the judges have no <hi>right, or power,</hi> by law, to do it; and therefore it may well be ſaid, they <hi>cannot,</hi> or are <hi>not able</hi> to do it.</p>
               <p>And whereas you ſay, that ſome <hi>Juries in our memory</hi> have been fined and impriſoned, you may poſſibly ſay true; but it is as true, that it hath been only in our memory; for no ſuch thing was practiſed in antient times; for ſo I find it aſſerted by a late learned judge
<note n="*" place="bottom">Lord chief juſtice <hi>Vaughan</hi> in his Reports, fol. 146.</note>, in theſe poſitive words: <hi>No caſe can be offered, either before attaints grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in general, or after, that ever a Jury was puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by fine and impriſonment by any judge, for not finding according to their evidence, and his direction, until</hi> Popham's <hi>time; nor is there clear proof, that he ever fined them for that reaſon, ſeparated from other miſdemeanours.</hi> And fol. 152, he affirms, — <hi>That no man can ſhew, that a Jury was ever pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed upon an information, either at law, or in the Star-Chamber, where the charge was only for find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Vaughan</hi>'s Reports, fol. 152.</note>: <hi>Much of the office of Jurors, in order to their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, is</hi> MINISTERIAL: <hi>as not withdrawing from their fellows after they are ſworn; not receiving from either ſide evidence not given in court; not eating and drinking before their verdict; refuſing to give a verdict,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>wherein if they tranſgreſs, they may be fincable. But the verdict itſelf when given, is not an act miniſterial, but</hi> JUDICIAL, <hi>and (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be) according to the beſt of their judgment; for which they are not finable, nor to be puniſhed, but by attaint;</hi> that is, by <hi>another Jury,</hi> in caſes where an attaint lies, and where it ſhall be found that <hi>wilfully,</hi> they gave a verdict, <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>corrupt.</hi>

               <p>They are <hi>many,</hi> but ſome of the moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident are theſe that follow. As for reaſons:</p>
               <p n="1">1. A Jury ought not to be fined, or impriſoned, becauſe they do not follow the judge's directions; for if they do follow his directions, they may yet be attained: and to ſay they gave their verdict according to his directions, is no bar but the judgment ſhall be <hi>reverſed,</hi> and they <hi>puniſhed</hi> for doing that, which if they had not done, they ſhould (by this opinion) have been fined, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned by the judge.—Which is <hi>unreaſonable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. If they <hi>do not follow</hi> his direction, and be therefore <hi>fined,</hi> yet they may be <hi>attainted,</hi> and ſo they ſhould be <hi>doubly</hi> puniſhed by diſtinct judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for the ſame offence; which the common law never admits.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To what end is the Jury to be returned out of the <hi>vicinage</hi> (that is, <hi>the neighbourhood</hi>) whence the iſſue ariſeth? to what end muſt <hi>hundredors</hi> be of the Jury, whom the law ſuppoſeth to have near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er knowledge of the fact than thoſe of the vicinage in general? to what end are they <hi>challenged</hi> ſo ſcrupulouſly to the <hi>array</hi> and <hi>poll?</hi> to what end muſt they have ſuch a certain <hi>freehold,</hi> and be <hi>probi, &amp; legales, homines,</hi> and not of <hi>affinity</hi> with the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties concerned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if after all this, they <hi>implicitly</hi> muſt give a verdict by the dictates, and authority of another man, under pain of <hi>fines,</hi> and <hi>impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> when ſworn to do it according to the beſt of
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:012414_0035_0F8997C512B6B9C8"/>their <hi>own knowledge?</hi> A man cannot ſee by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's eye, nor hear by <hi>another's ear;</hi> no more can a man conclude, or <hi>infer,</hi> the thing to be reſolved by <hi>another's</hi> underſtanding, or reaſoning; unleſs all mens underſtandings were equally alike. And if, merely in compliance, becauſe the judge <hi>ſays thus, or thus,</hi> a Jury ſhall give a verdict; tho' ſuch their verdict ſhould happen to be <hi>right,</hi> true, &amp; juſt; yet they being not aſſured <hi>it is ſo</hi> from their own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding are <hi>forſworn,</hi> atleaſt <hi>in foro conſcientiae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Were Jurors ſo <hi>finable,</hi> then every mayor, and bailiff of corporations, all ſtewards of leets, juſtices of peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whatever matters are tried before them, ſhall have <hi>verdicts to their minds,</hi> or elſe fine, and impriſon the Jurors till they <hi>have;</hi> ſo that ſuch muſt be either pleaſed, humoured, or gatified, elſe no juſtice, or right, is to be had in any court.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Whereas a perſon by law may <hi>challenge</hi> the ſheriff, or any Juryman, if of kin to his adverſary; yet he cannot challenge a mayor, recorder, juſtice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who 'tis poſſible will have a verdict for their <hi>kinſman,</hi> or againſt their <hi>enemy,</hi> or elſe fine and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon the Jury till they have obtained it: ſo that by this means our lives, liberties, and properties, ſhall be ſolely tried by, and remain at the arbitrary diſpoſal of every mercenary, or corrupted <hi>juſtice,</hi> mayor, bailiff, or recorder, if any ſuch ſhould, at any time, get into <hi>office.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. 'Tis unreaſonable that a Jury ſhould be finable on pretence of their going <hi>againſt their evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</hi> becauſe it can never be <hi>tried</hi> whether or no in truth they did find with, or againſt, their evidence, by reaſon no <hi>writ of error</hi> lies in the caſe.
<note n="*" place="bottom">And they may of their own knowledge have infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of various matters to exculpate, or condemn, of which the judge is wholly ignorant.</note>

7. Were Jurymen liable to ſuch arbitrary fines, they would be in a <hi>worſe condition</hi> than the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals that are tried by them; for in all civil ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, informations, and indictments, ſome appeals, or writs of falſe judgement, or of error, do lie into <hi>ſuperior courts</hi> to try the regular proceedings of the inferior. But here can be no after-trial, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination; but the Juryman (if fining at all were <hi>lawful</hi>) muſt either pay the fine, or lie by it; <hi>without remedy</hi> to decide, whether in his particular caſe he were legally fined, or not.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Without a fact agreed, it is as impoſſible for a judge, or any other to <hi>know the law,</hi> relating to that fact, or <hi>direct</hi> concerning it, as to know an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident that hath no ſubject; for as, where there is <hi>no law, there is no tranſgreſſion,</hi> ſo where there is <hi>no tranſgreſſion, there is no place for law:</hi> for <hi>the law</hi> (ſaith divine authority) <hi>is made for the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor.</hi> And as <hi>Coke</hi> tells us, <hi>Ex Facto Jus oritur,</hi> upon ſtating the fact, or tranſgreſſion, matter of law doth ariſe, or grow out of the root of the fact. Now the Jury being the <hi>ſole judges of fact, and matter in iſſue</hi> before them, not finding the fact on which the law ſhould ariſe, cannot be ſaid to find <hi>againſt law,</hi> which is no other than a ſuperſtructure on fact; ſo that to ſay they have found againſt the law, when <hi>no fact</hi> is found, is abſurd; an expreſſion inſignificant, and unintelligible.

Here you ſee it <hi>branded</hi> in <hi>parliament:</hi> Next you ſhall ſee it formally condemned on a ſolemn ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument by the <hi>judges.</hi> The caſe thus.</p>
            <p>At the ſeſſions for <hi>London, Sept.</hi> 1670, <hi>William Pen,</hi> and <hi>William Mead</hi> (two of the people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Quakers</hi>) were indicted, for that they with others, to the number of three hundred, on the 14th <hi>Aug.</hi> 22 <hi>Regis,</hi> in <hi>Gracechurch-Street,</hi> did with force, and arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> unlawfully, and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuouſly, aſſemble, and congregate themſelves together, to the diſturbance of the peace; and that the ſaid <hi>William Pen</hi> did there preach, and ſpeak, to the ſaid <hi>Mead,</hi> and other perſons in the open ſtreet; by reaſon whereof, a great concourſe, and <hi>tumult,</hi> of people in the ſtreet aforeſaid then, and there, a long time, did remain, and continue, in contempt of our ſaid lord the king, and of his law, to the great <hi>diſturbance</hi> of his peace, to the great <hi>terror</hi> and diſturbance, of many of his liege people, and ſubjects, to the ill example of all others in the like caſe offenders, and againſt the peace of our ſaid lord the king, his crown, and dignity.</p>
            <p>The priſoners pleading <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> it was proved, that there <hi>was a meeting</hi> at the time in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment mentioned, in <hi>Gracechurch-Street,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of three, or four hundred people, in the open ſtreet; that <hi>William Pen</hi> was <hi>ſpeaking, or preaching,</hi> to them, but <hi>what</hi> he ſaid, the witneſſes (who were officers and ſoldiers ſent to diſperſe them) could not <hi>hear.</hi>—This was the effect of the evidence; which Sir <hi>John Howel,</hi> the then record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, (as I find in the <hi>print</hi> of that trial) was pleaſed to ſum up to the Jury, in theſe words:</p>
            <p>
               <q>You have heard what the indictment is; it is for preaching to the people in the ſtreet, and drawing a tumultuous company after them, and Mr. <hi>Pen</hi> was ſpeaking: if they ſhould not be diſturbed, you ſee they will go on: there are
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:012414_0041_0F8997C972481200"/>three or four witneſſes that have proved this,— that he did preach there, that Mr. <hi>Mead</hi> did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of it. After this you have heard by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial witneſſes what is ſaid againſt them; <hi>Now we are upon the matter of fact, which you are to keep to, and obſerve, as what hath been fully ſworn, at your peril.</hi>

            <p n="1">1.

            <p>But now as to the poſitive qualifications requiſite.</p>
            <p n="1">1. You that are Jurymen, ſhould, firſt of all, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly regard the weight, and importance, of the
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:012414_0048_0F8997CF7437D028"/>office; your own ſouls, other mens lives, liberties, eſtates, all that in this world are dear to them, are at ſtake, and in your hands; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, conſider things well before hand, and come ſubſtantially furniſhed, and provided, with ſound, and well grounded, conſciences, with clear minds, free from malice, fear, hope, or favour; leſt, inſtead of <hi>judging</hi> others, thou ſhouldeſt work thy own condemnation, and ſtand in the ſight of God, the Creator, and Judge, of all men, no better than a <hi>Murtherer,</hi> or <hi>perjured</hi> Malefactor.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Obſerve well the record, indictment, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation that is read, and the ſeveral parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, both as to the matter, manner, and form.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Take due notice of, and pay regard, to the evidence offered for proof of the indictment, and each part of it, as well to <hi>manner,</hi> and <hi>form,</hi> as <hi>matter;</hi> and if you ſuſpect any ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And, for your better ſatisfaction, endeavour to write down the evidence, or the heads thereof, that you may, the better, recall it to memory.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Take notice of the nature of the crime charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and what law the proſecution is grounded upon, and diſtinguiſh the ſuppoſed criminal fact, which is proved, from the aggravating circumſtances, which are not proved.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Remember that in Juries there is no plurality of voices to be allowed: ſeven cannot over rule, or, by virtue of majority, conclude five; no, nor eleven, one.

And, therefore, if one man differ in opinion from his fellows, they muſt be kept together, till either they, by ſtrength of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or argument, can ſatisfy him, or he convince them. For he is not to be hectored, much leſs pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, by the court into a compliance; for as the lord chief Juſtice <hi>Vaughan</hi> ſays well
