            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

as what <hi>you</hi> want an Anſwer to, I propoſe therefore at preſent to confine my Reflections to <hi>theſe;</hi> waving all Remarks on the concluding Pages, and paſſing over what may be exceptionable in the Author's Introduction.</p>
               <p>The main Scope of his <hi>Letter</hi> is the Trial of Mr. <hi>Whitefield'</hi>s Spirit, in Point of <hi>Chriſtian Simplicity</hi> and <hi>moral Honeſty;</hi> which our Author ſeems to think not diſcoverable in ſome Parts of his publick Conduct.—If I know myſelf, Sir, I would not be a blind Bigot to any Man, the wiſeſt and beſt upon Earth; or <hi>have his Perſon in Admiration, becauſe of Advantage,</hi> in any Reſpect: And as for Mr. <hi>W</hi>—<hi>d,</hi> I think I feel in me a proper Temper to ſee Miſtakes and Failings in <hi>him</hi> as ſoon as in another.—Nor can I but highly approve every due Teſtimony againſt all <hi>Diſſimulation,</hi> eſpecially in ſacred Affairs; and juſtify the contending for <hi>Simplicity and godly Sincerity,</hi> as an Eſſential in the Character of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> who ought to be an <hi>Example to the Flock.</hi> And I muſt acknowledge, if our <hi>Author</hi> carries this Point againſt Mr. <hi>W</hi>—<hi>d,</hi> he will give the moſt thorow Stab to his Name; and muſt ſhake, if not demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, his Intereſt with the unbias'd Part of Mankind.—But then the Uſe we ſhould make of this Reflection, is to treat a Point ſo delicate, and of ſuch Importance, with the utmoſt Caution to avoid <hi>evil Surmiſings,</hi> and to exemplify that <hi>Charity</hi> which <hi>thinketh no Evil,</hi> which <hi>believeth all Things, hopeth all Things,</hi> for the beſt.—The <hi>Conſequence</hi> being ſo vaſt, we ſhould well conſider what <hi>Premiſſes</hi> we draw it from, that they be good and ſound and clear, a ſufficient Foundation to ſupport the heavy Concluſion. And ſurely in a Caſe, of this critical Nature and of ſo much Moment, nothing ſhort of undoubted <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Evidence,</hi> nothing ſhort of inconteſtible <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Fact,</hi> view'd in the faireſt comparative Light, <hi>without Partiality, and without Hypocriſy,</hi> can be valid and juſt Grounds to form our Judgment upon. How our <hi>Author</hi> has acquitted himſelf in his Trial of Mr. <hi>W</hi>—<hi>d'</hi>s Caſe, you will know my Opinion by the Sequel of this Review.</p>
               <p>The main Thing to be examin'd into, is the Buſineſs of the <hi>Clergy-Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions</hi> and <hi>Promiſes</hi> (made at entring into holy Orders) compar'd with ſome late Inſtances of Mr. <hi>Whitefield'</hi>s Conduct; wherein our <hi>Author</hi> ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects him guilty of the moſt culpable <hi>Inconſiſtence,</hi> ſuch as bewrays <q>
                     <hi>a wicked Inſincerity,</hi> and <hi>aggravated Prevarication,</hi> to ſay no worſe,</q>—Theſe were high Charges indeed, if brought in Form, and need very full and poſitive Evidence to gain them Credit with reaſonable and impartial Judges. <hi>Againſt an Elder receive not an Accuſation, but before two or three Witneſſes.</hi>—Aware of this, our <hi>Author</hi> therefore deals little in formal and direct <hi>Accuſations,</hi> but proceeds generally by Way of <hi>Inquiry</hi> and <hi>Inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> exhibiting his Grounds of <hi>Jealouſy,</hi> and calling upon Mr. <hi>W</hi>—<hi>d</hi> to <hi>clear up his Innocence,</hi> or elſe <hi>confeſs his Guilt;</hi> though, it appears plain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Face of his Performance, he thinks it's the <hi>latter</hi> only, that he has any Reaſon to expect.

               <p>Further more, This is confirmed by the TITLE of this <hi>Article;</hi> which ſtands thus, <hi>Of the Unworthineſs of the Miniſters, which hinder not the Effects of the SACRAMENTS.</hi> The Title is wont to be appeal'd to in ſuch Caſes, for the true Purport and Deſign of what follows in the Body of any Law, Canon, Chapter, or Article. And I muſt obſerve, had our Author not left out the <hi>Title</hi> of this 26th <hi>Article,</hi> I'm prone to think, every common Reader muſt have been aware of the Fallacy of the <hi>two Columns,</hi> and would eaſily have ſeen thro' the thin Appearance.—I muſt add, Nor can I look upon our <hi>Author</hi> as acting ſo fair a Part, in ſecreting from our People (little acquainted with the Book of <hi>Articles</hi>) one whole Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, when he ſpeaks of "ſetting down <hi>the Article,</hi>" by which one would ſuppoſe he had done it at full Length. For by thus mutilating it, he has left out what is added in the laſt Paragraph very fitly and ſeaſonably, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventany Abuſe of the former; and what, I muſt acknowledge, ſeems to countenance Mr. <hi>W</hi>—<hi>d'</hi>s Zeal againſt evil and unworthy Miniſters. The Words therefore I think proper to have reſtored, and will inſert here. The <hi>Article</hi> concludes thus; <hi>"Nevertheleſs it appertaineth to the Diſcipline of the Church, that Enquiry be made of Evil Miniſters, and that they be accuſed by thoſe that have Knowledge of their Offences, and finally being found guilty by Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, be depoſed."</hi>—Upon which Biſhop <hi>Beveridge</hi> has the following Remark. <q>It being determined in the former Part of the <hi>Article,</hi> that the Unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs of the Miniſter doth not hinder the Effect of the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> it is very opportunely added in this, that ſuch unworthy Miniſters ought to be enquired out, yea, and proceeded againſt according to the Diſcipline of the Church.</q>—And Biſhop <hi>Burnet</hi> (in his Expoſition of the 39 Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, remarks upon it) that <q>
                     <hi>Timothy</hi> was required to receive <hi>an Accuſation of an Elder,</hi> when regularly tender'd to him, and to <hi>rebuke before all, thoſe that ſinned;</hi> and he was charged to withdraw himſelf from thoſe <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers who conſented not to wholeſome Words,</hi> and that made <hi>a Gain of Godlineſs.</hi>—Certainly (he adds) there is nothing more incumbent on the whole Body of the Church, than that all poſſible Care be taken to diſcover the bad Practices that may be among the Clergy.—But after all, our Zeal muſt go along with Juſtice and Diſcretion: Fame may be a juſt Ground to enquire upon, but a Sentence cannot be founded on it.</q>—According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mr. <hi>W</hi>—<hi>d</hi> is for having all prudent Steps taken in Purſuance of this laſt Paragraph of the <hi>Article,</hi> that <hi>evil Miniſters</hi> may be <hi>inquired out,</hi> detected

However, whereas he declares himſelf <hi>verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that the Generality of Preachers talk of an unknown unfelt Chriſt,</hi> he has therefore on ſome Occaſions <hi>opened his Mouth boldly againſt unconverted Miniſters:</hi> giving it as his Opinion, that <hi>the Reaſon why Congregations have been ſo dead, is becauſe they have had dead Men preaching to them.</hi>—Now, As to the Grounds of his <hi>Conduct,</hi> or how far his <hi>Sentiment</hi> may be juſt and well-founded, I am not oblig'd in this Place to inquire: for the Argument we are upon, calls me only to conſider, whether the <hi>one</hi> or the <hi>other</hi> be <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent</hi> with his <hi>Subſcription,</hi> and contrary to the <hi>Article,</hi> which our Author has confronted him with. And for my Part, on a ſedate View of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, according to all the Lights I have been capable of placing it in, I can't diſcern the pretended <hi>Inconſiſtence,</hi> nor believe Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> and his <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription</hi> to be at oppoſite Angles. For, as to his <hi>Conduct,</hi> in <hi>preaching</hi> after a general Manner <hi>againſt unconverted Miniſters,</hi> this ſurely is rather a Proof of his <hi>Adherence</hi> to his Subſcription, as it manifeſts his being in Earneſt to have the genuine Drift of the <hi>Article,</hi> in its laſt Paragraph, faithfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, by all due <hi>Inquiry,</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> in Relation to <hi>evil Miniſters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as for his <hi>Sentiment</hi> touching the immediate natural or moral <hi>Reaſon</hi> of <hi>Congregations having been ſo dead</hi> in Times paſt, <hi>namely, their having had dead Men to preach to them,</hi> neither do I at preſent ſee any Variance between this and the <hi>Article.</hi> If Mr. <hi>W</hi>—<hi>d'</hi>s Opinion in the Caſe implies any Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to the <hi>Article,</hi> I think it muſt be to one or other of the following <hi>Clauſes</hi> in it: where yet, for my own Part, I muſt confeſs, I am ſenſible of <hi>no Claſh.</hi> For Mr. <hi>W</hi>—<hi>d'</hi>s aſſigning ſuch a <hi>Reaſon,</hi> as above ſaid, does by no Means imply but that in ſome Caſes, agreeable to the <hi>Article, "We</hi> MAY <hi>uſe the Miniſtry of evil Men:"</hi> And indeed conſonant to this is his own Practice, as well as avow'd Principle.—Nor yet do's his ſaid <hi>Reaſon</hi> imply, in Oppoſition to the <hi>Article,</hi> that "<hi>the Effect of Chriſt's Ordinances is taken away by their Wickedneſs, or the Grace of God's Gifts diminiſhed,</hi> FROM SUCH <hi>as by</hi> FAITH <hi>and</hi> RIGHTLY <hi>do receive the</hi> SACRAMENTS."

               </opener>
               <p>THIS waits on you with ſome further Obſervations, on the late printed LETTER to Mr. <hi>Whitefield,</hi> objecting to ſome of his Meaſures, and calling upon him to <hi>vindicate his Conduct, or confeſs his Faults.</hi> I have ſpoken ſufficiently to the firſt Fact there alledged againſt him: And as there is nothing of Connection between that and the others, I have no Need of repeating any Thing already ſaid, to introduce my Remarks on our <hi>Author'</hi>s ſecond Objection.</p>
               <p>In the next Place then, you obſerve, Sir, he excepts againſt Mr. <hi>W</hi>—<hi>d'</hi>s Conduct in <hi>publickly praying, and adminiſtring the Sacrament, without any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Form preſcribed in the Book of Common-Prayer.</hi> Our Author ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects him to be <hi>herein acting, not a conſiſtent,</hi> but <hi>a wicked inſincere Part;</hi> and fears, this <hi>his Practice</hi> is <hi>an open Violation of what he ſubſcrib'd and promis'd at his Ordination,</hi> and afterwards <hi>ſolemnly, and repeatedly ſealed his Approbation of at the bleſſed Sacrament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, my Friend, as you are not wont to be eaſily impos'd upon with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Inſinuations, with meer Sophiſms, or with Arguments more <hi>ad Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pam,</hi> than <hi>ad Pugnam:</hi> ſo I ſhall much wonder, if the Declamation upon this Head appears to you to have any real Weight in it, after it has paſs'd a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Examination. For as pathetick and peremptory as our Author is here, I very much doubt whether he has not miſs'd the true Meaning of the <hi>Church-Clergy's Subſcription</hi> and <hi>Declaration</hi> he talks ſo much of,—as expounded e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by Themſelves; and whether he has ſufficiently conſider'd the true Force and Extent of the <hi>Obligation</hi> reſulting therefrom, in Relation to their <hi>approving the Common-Prayer-Book,</hi> and <hi>uſing the Form in the ſaid Book
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005594_0014_1026A7F5B38D6EF8"/>
preſcribed, in publick Prayer and Adminiſtration of Sacraments,</hi> AND NONE OTHER.</p>
               <p>The firſt Step neceſſary to deciding any <hi>Queſtion,</hi> is to adjuſt and ſettle the Meaning of the <hi>Terms.</hi> And poſſibly, in the <hi>Subſcription</hi> or <hi>Declaration</hi> aboveſaid, it may admit of ſome Debate, what is the genuine Import and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the concluding Words, NONE OTHER. I am confident, upon the ſureſt Grounds, this limiting Clauſe is not to be taken literally, in the Strictneſs of the Expreſſion, as if the Clergy meant to oblige themſelves to the <hi>ſole</hi> Uſe of that <hi>individual</hi> Form in the Prayer-Book, <hi>excluſive</hi> of all other Forms in every Caſe. For this Conſtruction is utterly forbidden by theſe two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations. (1.) It is contrary to the common Practice of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> who in their <hi>Prayer before Sermon</hi> pay no Regard to the <hi>Form</hi> in that Caſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the <hi>Canon;</hi> as I ſhall have Occaſion more particularly to remark hereafter.—And then (2.) It is contrary to the known Cuſtom of the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> in compoſing <hi>new</hi> Offices and Forms of Devotion, on ſome ſpecial Occaſions. It has been a Thing frequent, on Occaſion of a ſpecial <hi>Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving</hi> or <hi>Faſt,</hi> to have ſpecial <hi>Forms</hi> or <hi>Offices</hi> printed before-hand and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to every Pariſh, for publick Uſe in the Church on ſuch Days. I well remember, particularly in the late Queen <hi>ANNE'</hi>s Reign, as by Means of the <hi>then-War</hi> there were frequent Occaſions of this Nature, I had the Sight of ſome of the <hi>Forms of Prayer</hi> ſpecially provided in that Caſe. And in them, I muſt obſerve by the Way, there were uſually one or two Collects for <hi>the Reformed Churches abroad:</hi>—which you'll pleaſe to bear in Mind for a future Occaſion, in the Sequel of this Diſpute.—Now theſe Reflections make it evident, to a Demonſtration, that when the <hi>Clergy</hi> of the Church ſubſcribe to uſe the <hi>Common-Prayer-Form,</hi> AND NONE OTHER, this is not to be taken in the <hi>rigid</hi> Senſe, as our Author underſtands it, abſolutely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding all other Forms on every Occaſion whatſoever. No, but the Senſe muſt be <hi>temper'd</hi> ſome how, to reconcile it to the <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> in the Church, as abovemention'd. I can readily think of but two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, to put upon the Words, that are <hi>conſiſtent. Ex. gr.</hi> Muſt the Words, NONE OTHER, intend—none other <hi>ſtatedly?</hi> This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction reconciles the Senſe to the Uſe of other <hi>occaſional</hi> Forms, enjoin'd by lawful Authority, ſuch as the <hi>new</hi> Compoſures made by the Biſhops, as above. But then I muſt obſerve, this Conſtruction does not ſo well ſuit with the Practice of the Clergy in <hi>ſtatedly</hi> praying <hi>before Sermon</hi> without <hi>uſing the Form preſcribed</hi> for the Pulpit-Prayer.—Shall we then ſay, the Words, NONE OTHER, muſt intend NONE DIVERS <hi>in kind, None elſe eſſentially varying from it.</hi> The Word, <hi>Other,</hi> is uſed either to denote a <hi>numerical</hi> Difference, or a <hi>ſpecifical</hi> Difference. But if we conſtrue it here in the former Senſe (i. e. None other ſo much as <hi>numerically</hi> diſtinguiſht from the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi>) we muſt ſuppoſe the <hi>Clergy</hi> chain'd down by their Subſcription to the Uſe of the <hi>Form in the Book,</hi> invariably, only, and exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively of <hi>every Form</hi> not actually there written: which is a Senſe evidently

               </p>
               <p>But further, let me obſerve to you, <hi>Sir,</hi> if we ſhould go into a critical Conſideration of what muſt be underſtood, by fair Conſtruction, as inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Idea of PUBLICK PRAYER, according to the Idiom of <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, it would perhaps be no impoſſible Attempt, to reconcile Mr. <hi>W</hi>—<hi>d'</hi>s <hi>Conduct</hi> abroad with his <hi>subſcription</hi> and <hi>Declaration</hi> at home. Its well known, the PUBLICK MINISTERS (ſo; called) in <hi>England</hi> are Miniſters Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copally ordered, in Conformity to the Book of Ordination: Such only are held <hi>Miniſters in the Church of England.</hi>—So, the PUBLICK CHURCHES there, are the Cathedral and other Collegiate Churches, the Pariſh-Churches, and Chappels, conſecrated to perform Divine Service in according to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Church eſtabliſh'd by Law.—And thus, in the Senſe of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription before us, PUBLICK PRAYER is "common and open Prayer" in the <hi>publick Churches,</hi> the Houſes dedicated to the <hi>Uſe</hi> of "miniſtring in the Congregation, by the preſcript Form of Divine Service in the Church of <hi>England.</hi>" At leaſt this is the <hi>Canonical</hi> Senſe of the Expreſſion. For the <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> and <hi>Canons</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> know no ſuch Think as PUBLICK Prayer done in <hi>"private Conventicles";</hi> or in "PRETENDED CHURCHES, which is the <hi>Canonical</hi> Denomination for all "<hi>Meetings Aſſemblies, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations (of the king's born Subjects) within this Realm,</hi>" OTHER than the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Congregations or Aſſemblies, By <hi>Law</hi> eſtabliſhed.—Nor in Truth are any deem'd PUBLICK OFFICES in Religion, <hi>other</hi> than thoſe performed in theſe <hi>true</hi> and <hi>lawful</hi> Aſſemblies, the only PUBLICK ASSEMBLIES in the Senſe of the <hi>Canons.</hi>—Now, according to this View of the Caſe, tho' ſome (ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolete) <hi>Canons</hi> of the Church may poſſibly be alledg'd against Mr. <hi>W</hi>—<hi>d'</hi>s Conduct, in Point of frequenting <hi>Conventicles,</hi> or <hi>pretended Churches,</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring in <hi>private Meetings,</hi> as if the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> were <hi>true</hi> and <hi>lawful Churches;</hi> yet with Regard to not <hi>uſing the Church-Liturgy in</hi> PUBLICK <hi>Prayer,</hi> I don't ſee he was either broken any Canon, or infring'd upon his Subſcription. I queſtion indeed whether the Clergy of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> hold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005594_0016_1026A7FCC9F02C98"/>
obliged by their <hi>Subſcription</hi> to the like invariable Uſe of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer-Book in the <hi>private Offices</hi> of Devotion, as in <hi>Publick Prayer.</hi> And if the <hi>Nonconformable</hi> Aſſemblies are reputed but <hi>private</hi> Meetings, a Church-Clergyman occaſionally officiating in <hi>ſuch</hi> Meetings may eſteem himſelf at Liberty to ſuſpend the Uſe of the Forms preſcribed for <hi>Publick Prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, <hi>Sir,</hi> if you judge this Argument turns upon too critical Diſtinctions, and are diſpos'd to allow, that the religious Aſſemblies in <hi>New-England</hi> are properly, what our <hi>Author</hi> calls'em, <hi>Publick Aſſemblies,</hi> not what the <hi>Church-Canons</hi> cenſure by the Name of <hi>pretended Churches,</hi> or private Conventicles, and that therefore <hi>Prayer</hi> performed in ſuch Aſſemblies is in juſt Conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Publick Prayer,</hi>—I need not ſtand to debate this Point with you at preſent.</p>
               <p>Other Reaſons I have ſtill, <hi>Sir,</hi> why I can by no Means concur with our <hi>Author,</hi> in thinking that Mr. W—d'<hi>s Subſcription</hi> to the ſpecial <hi>Article,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to, obliges him ſo indiſpenſably to uſe the <hi>Common-Prayer-Forms,</hi> but that he may <hi>occaſionally</hi> omit uſing them, where he judges <hi>Free-praying</hi> moſt expedient and eligible (all Circumſtances conſider'd) as here in the <hi>New-England</hi> Congregations. For undoubtedly this particular <hi>Subſcription</hi> to that ſpecial <hi>Article</hi> about the Uſe of the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> is not juſtly to be ſuppos'd of more <hi>extenſive</hi> Obligation in Point of <hi>Place,</hi> than his general <hi>Subſcription</hi> to the 39 <hi>Articles of Religion.</hi> And if we conſult the <hi>Ratification</hi> at the End of the Book of <hi>Articles,</hi> this expreſly tells us <hi>how f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r</hi> they extend by Force of the <hi>Subſcription,</hi> being only "<hi>approved and allowed to be holden and executed</hi> WITHIN THE REALM" of <hi>England;</hi> and here it ſtops, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Addition of <hi>"other Dominions,"</hi> as elſewhere ſometimes. Now this <hi>Ratification</hi> is one Thing expreſly included within the <hi>three parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Articles,</hi> our Author refers to, as what the Church eſteems of great Importance; and I think, Mr. <hi>W—d</hi> has ſubſcrib'd to the <hi>Ratification</hi> in the 3d <hi>Article,</hi> as well as to the <hi>Uſe of the common Prayer</hi> in the <hi>ſecond.</hi> By a fair Conſequence then, laying theſe Things together, and interpreting the 2d <hi>Article</hi> by the 3d, his <hi>Subſcription</hi> to the <hi>Uſe of the Form</hi> in <hi>the Common-Prayer-Book preſcribed,</hi> AND NONE OTHER, muſt in Reaſon be conſtrued, at the moſt; but only an Engagement to <hi>uſe</hi> that WITHIN THE REALM, where it is by publick Authority eſtabliſh'd; and not be ſuppos'd to extend its Obligation indifferently <hi>all over the World,</hi> or even ſo far as <hi>New England,</hi> which tho' belonging to the <hi>King's Dominions,</hi> yet is not WITHIN HIS REALM, but is included under the Name of FOREIGN PARTS, conſtantly ſo apply'd even by the incorporated <hi>Society</hi> at home for <hi>propagating the Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that the above Remark is not without very juſt Foundation, it may further help to convince you, if you'll inſpect the <hi>Canon</hi> next to that our <hi>Author</hi> has alledg'd on this Occaſion. The 37th <hi>Canon</hi> requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the very ſame <hi>Subſcription,</hi> in Caſe of a <hi>licenſed Miniſter's coming to</hi> RESIDE IN ANY DIOCESS, ſays, <hi>He ſhall not be permitted,</hi> THERE <hi>to preach,—

unleſs he firſt conſent and ſubſcribe to the</hi> three Articles <hi>before mentioned, in the Preſence of the</hi> BISHOP <hi>of the</hi> DIOCESS <hi>wherein he is to preach</hi>—Now from the Tenor of this <hi>Canon</hi> it's evident, that the <hi>Article</hi> engaging a Clergyman to <hi>uſe</hi> in publick Worſhip the <hi>Church of England Form, and none other</hi> (whatever Senſe you put upon the Words) is only <hi>then</hi> obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to him, by Virtue of his <hi>Subſcription,</hi> while he is RESIDING <hi>in</hi> ſome DIOCESS, and offering himſelf THERE <hi>to preach.</hi>—Conſequently the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriber,</hi> tho' here in <hi>New-England</hi> (or other <hi>foreign</hi> Parts) he intermits the Uſe of the <hi>Forms of Prayer, and Orders and Ceremonies preſcribed in the Communion Book, or the Book of Common-Prayer,</hi> yet he is not liable for this to the Penalties of the following (38th) <hi>Canon,</hi> under this Title,—<hi>Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>You are ſenſible, Sir, it's of the very Nature of <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Canons,</hi> that they refer to <hi>Place,</hi> and be circumſcrib'd within <hi>Boundaries</hi> fix'd and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.—The <hi>Orders</hi> of the <hi>Church of England</hi> being limited to be <hi>held and executed</hi> WITHIN THE REALM, the Clergy's <hi>Subſcription</hi> to them muſt of Conſequence have but a <hi>local</hi> and <hi>limited</hi> Obligation upon them to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity; reaching at furtheſt only to an equal Extent with the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and binding Force of the ſaid <hi>Orders</hi> themſelves.—Our <hi>Author</hi> then can never expect to carry his Argument againſt Mr. <hi>W—d,</hi> unleſs he is able to prove, That no poſſible Change of <hi>Situation,</hi> no poſſible Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Place</hi> in point of Reſidence, will infer any the leaſt <hi>Variation</hi> as to the <hi>obliging</hi> Nature and Force of his <hi>Subſcription;</hi> but that the <hi>Caſe</hi> is

               </p>
               <p>But our <hi>Author</hi> might be ask'd if he thinks Mr. <hi>W—d</hi> is juſtly charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with <hi>violating his Subſcription,</hi> by miniſtring in SCOTLAND in <hi>like Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> as he has done in theſe Parts, without uſing the <hi>Epiſcopal Form</hi> of Religion?—For if Mr. <hi>W—d</hi> as thus managing <hi>there,</hi> is tho't juſtly to be <hi>acquitted,</hi> I ſhould think by Parity of Reaſon, his Conduct <hi>here</hi> ought not to be <hi>condemned</hi> in this Point; Becauſe the two Caſes, as they appear in my View of Things, are at leaſt very nigh <hi>parallel:</hi> and if here (Sir) <hi>you</hi> differ from me in Opinion, I pray the Grounds or your Judgment.—But if our <hi>Author,</hi> to be conſiſtent with himſelf, ſhould accuſe and cenſure his Conduct in SCOTLAND, as well as here, I think it's worthy of Conſideration, how egregiouſly he will thereby redect upon the <hi>Church of England</hi> as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in her <hi>Charity,</hi> and violating the <hi>Communion of Saints.</hi> For Mr. <hi>W—d's</hi>s Conduct <hi>there</hi> can't be condemn'd on the Foot of his <hi>Subſcription,</hi> without ſuppoſing that the <hi>Church of England</hi> intended, by impoſing upon her Clergy the <hi>Subſcription</hi> aforeſaid, to tie them up from occaſional Acts of <hi>Miniſterial Communion</hi> with all other <hi>National Churches;</hi> not excepting even her Siſter-Church of SCOTLAND, bordering ſo near upon her, and whoſe Proſperity ſtands ſo cloſely connected with her own. It muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be a ſcandalous Imputation on the <hi>Church of England,</hi> to ſuppoſe her ſo unconſcionably <hi>bigotted</hi> to her own eſtabliſh'd Form of Religion as to <hi>forbid</hi> her <hi>Clergy</hi> all <hi>occaſional Conformity</hi> to the different Mode of Worſhip in a <hi>Siſter-Church,</hi> when Providence gives them an Opportunity, and their own Conſcience puts no Bar in the Way. That were in Effect to renounce the <hi>Communion of Churches;</hi> this being very much ſupported and carry'd on by <hi>Clerical</hi> Communion, or the Interchange of mutual Offices of Love and Aſſiſtance between their reſpective <hi>Miniſters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you'll be pleas'd, <hi>Sir,</hi> to conſult the <hi>Articles, Canons,</hi> and <hi>Orders</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Writings of her ancient Divines, you will ſee no Colour of Reaſon, for ſo diſhonourable a Thought of the <hi>Engliſh Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,</hi> as if they were for laying an abſolute <hi>Prohibition</hi> upon the <hi>Clergy</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in Regard of <hi>Occaſional Communion</hi> with foreign Churches, in the Adminiſtration of any Branch of their miniſterial Office. I am perſwaded, thoſe pious <hi>Reformers</hi> never meant to exclude the <hi>Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Churches</hi> abroad from their Charity, tho' differently conſtituted in Point of Eccleſiaſtical Government and external Modalities in Religion. They never meant to ſet up the <hi>Church of England</hi> for the <hi>Head &amp; Centre</hi> of <hi>Chriſtian Unity,</hi> expecting all other Churches to reduce themſelves to her Standard, upon Pain of being ſhut out from her Charity and Fellowſhip in the Goſpel.—No; ſo far from this, that whoever converſes with their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in Print, or with the Hiſtories of thoſe Times, will ſee abundant E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that the <hi>Church of England,</hi> in that Day profeſſed a <hi>Catholick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="unknown:005594_0019_1026A80601AF6968"/>
with the <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> and were firmly <hi>united</hi> with them all in Charity and Affection, as <hi>Members</hi> of <hi>one Body</hi> with herſelf. Nor can it reaſonably be ſuppos'd, they condemn'd the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of all other Proteſtant Churches, while they did not renounce the Communion of the <hi>Churches</hi> themſelves. And I believe, none but ſuch as have their <hi>Brain heated</hi> with the ſtrange Fire of <hi>Bigotry</hi> to the Engliſh Epiſcopacy and Liturgy, and have got little narrow <hi>Party-Notions,</hi> the very Reverſe to thoſe of the <hi>firſt Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,</hi> can ever have it enter into their Head to imagine, that the <hi>Church of England</hi> has ſat up herſelf for the <hi>only</hi> true Church upon Earth.</p>
               <p>Her 19th <hi>Article</hi> expreſſes no ſuch Schiſmatick Spirit; but frames the Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of a <hi>Church</hi> lawfully conſtituted, in ſuch large and general Terms, as to comprehend all the <hi>Foreign</hi> Proteſtant Churches, as well as herſelf. Thus ſays the <hi>Article,—"A viſible Church of Chriſt is a Congregation of faithful Men, in the which the pure Word of God is preached, and the Sacraments be duly adminiſtred ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Chriſt's Ordinance, in all thoſe Things that of Neceſſity are requiſite to the ſame."</hi> Bp. BURNET has this Remark upon it among others—<q>We ought to <hi>ſearch</hi> the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and then according as we find the <hi>Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine</hi> of any <hi>Church</hi> to be <hi>true</hi> in the Fundamentals, we ought to believe her to be a <hi>true Church:</hi> And if beſides this, the whole Extent of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Worſhip,</hi> together not only with the eſſential Parts of the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> but the whole Adminiſtration of them and the other Rituals of any Church are <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>true,</hi> then we ought to account ſuch a Church <hi>true</hi> in the largeſt Senſe of the Word <hi>True;</hi> and by Conſequence we ought to hold <hi>Communion</hi> with it.</q>—Surely then the <hi>Church of England</hi> could not intend to confine her <hi>Clergy</hi> to her own Communion alone: and the <hi>Article</hi> leaves every one to the Exerciſe of his <hi>own</hi> private Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The <hi>Biſhop'</hi>s Expoſition of this Article might be confirm'd, I doubt not, from the <hi>Homilies</hi> and <hi>Prayers</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and from the Writings of the Engliſh Biſhops and Divines in the beginning of the Reformation, which are the beſt Commentaries on the <hi>Articles.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable is that Paſſage of the famous HOOKER, in his <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Polity</hi> (Lib. 3. Sec. 11.)—<q>For my own Part, altho' I ſee that certain <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches,</hi> the SCOTTISH eſpecially and the FRENCH, have not that which <hi>beſt</hi> agreeth with the ſacred Scripture, I mean the Government that is by <hi>Biſhops,</hi> inaſmuch as both thoſe Churches are fallen under a different Kind of Regiment, which for the one it is altogether too <hi>late,</hi> and too <hi>ſoon</hi> for the other, during their preſent Affliction and Trouble, this their Defect and Imperfection I had rather lament in ſuch Caſe than exagitate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>—After this, <hi>Sir,</hi> I preſume, none can reaſonably imagine, the great HOOKER condemn'd and diſclaim'd the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of the SCOTTISH, or other <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Churches abroad. And <hi>he</hi> doubtleſs ſpake what was the general Senſe of the <hi>Church of England</hi> in his Day.—But further, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Church of <hi>England.</hi> For Inſtance, as Mr. <hi>Strype,</hi> in his Life of GRINDAL A. Bp. of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> informs us, the ſaid <hi>Arch biſhop</hi> licenſed Mr. <hi>John Morriſon,</hi> a Scotch Divine, to preach and adminiſter the Sacraments any where within his Province, by Virtue of his <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Ordination. In his Licence 'tis expreſly noticed of him, <q>He had been admitted to <hi>holy Orders</hi> about five years before, by the Synod (or Presbytery) of <hi>Lothian,</hi> according to the LAUDABLE <hi>Form and Rite of the Reformed Church of</hi> SCOTLAND.</q>—Again, 'tis obſervable, the Church of <hi>England</hi> has not ſcrupled to do publick Honour to the Church of SCOTLAND, even at a Time when the ſaid <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Church was <hi>presbyterian</hi> in her Conſtitution. For ſo it was, when the <hi>Canons</hi> were compiled: and yet in the 55th, which is the <hi>Canon</hi> preſcribing the Preacher's <hi>Form of Prayer before Sermon,</hi> it is there enjoined on the Clergy to pray for the <hi>Church of</hi> SCOTLAND by Name.—I hope, this has not been any Occaſion of the modern Clergy's cuſtomary Omiſſion of the <hi>Canonical Form.</hi>—However, I ſhall reſt it with your Judgment, whether it be likely, that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> which by a ſolemn <hi>Canon</hi> and <hi>Conſtitution</hi> appoints the Church of SCOTLAND to be expreſly pray'd for by all the Clergy, ſhould ever deſign to brand the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of that Church as falſe or invalid, by Precluding her Sons from all occaſional <hi>Commerce</hi> therewith in ſacred Adminiſtrations: which muſt be the Effect, if ſhe has ſet ſuch Limits to them in Relation to <hi>the Uſe of the Common-Prayer,</hi> as that without this, they muſt on no Occaſion preſume publickly to officiate in the Church of SCOTLAND.—Again, <hi>Sir,</hi> it muſt needs be granted, the Church of SCOTLAND ſtands at leaſt on equal Terms with the <hi>Engliſh Church,</hi> as the Church of GENEVA. And yet, if you have ſeen a certain <hi>Letter</hi> from the Univerſity of OXFORD (dated Feb. 5. 1706.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

You can't be inſenſible, <hi>Sir,</hi> that ſuch Terms of <hi>Univerſality,</hi> tho' deliver'd abſolutely, are often to be conſtru'd in a more lax and qualify'd Senſe: in many Caſes, the very Nature and Reaſon of Things obliges us to <hi>not</hi> take them in the moſt extenſive Senſe, but to put ſome Reſtriction upon their Meaning. Nor is it acting an ingenuous Part, to urge ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty a <hi>Conſequence,</hi> as is depending in the preſent Caſe, upon the meer Force of a <hi>Word,</hi> taken by our Author in an <hi>unreſtrain'd,</hi> when it fairly admits of a <hi>limited</hi> Signification.

For Inſtance, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the <hi>Promiſe</hi> here of a direct Promiſe ALWAYS <hi>to miniſter,</hi> &amp;c. may it not admit of ſuch limited Conſtructions as the following? ALWAYS ſo long as I am <hi>where</hi> I MAY <hi>miniſter</hi> in this Form and Manner.—(For what a learned Defender of the Church of England has ſaid about the <hi>Burial-Office</hi> in particular, I think is applicable as to all the Offices and Forms in general, "<hi>We</hi> [the Clergy]<hi>give our Aſſent to the Uſe of it,</hi> where <hi>it may be uſed, and that is all.</hi>") Or, ALWAYS, ſo long as I am <hi>reſiding in any Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs:</hi>—Or, ALWAYS, ſo long as I am <hi>within the Church and Realm of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, where this Form of <hi>Miniſtration</hi> is <hi>received</hi> as <hi>according to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God.</hi>—And it's obſervable, the Manner of Expreſſion in the <hi>Promiſe</hi> itſelf [<hi>as this</hi> CHURCH <hi>and</hi> REALM <hi>hath received the ſame</hi>] points us very plainly to the laſt Reſtriction. And I conclude, Mr. <hi>W—d,</hi> when miniſtring in the publick Churches, has never been wanting to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, but ALWAYS careful to practiſe full <hi>Conformity</hi> to the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in his Sacramental Miniſtrations, during his Stay <hi>within the Realm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſtill, upon a Review of this <hi>Promiſe,</hi> I find by the Tenor of it Room for another <hi>Reſtriction,</hi> which reduces the Obligation of it within the narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Limits, not exceeding the Bounds of even that ſingle <hi>Congregation,</hi> where he has <hi>Charge.</hi> Surely, His <hi>Promiſe</hi> in Anſwer to the <hi>Queſtion</hi> put to him at Ordination, ought in all Reaſon to be interpreted as carrying an <hi>Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> or <hi>Proportion</hi> with the <hi>Biſhop'</hi>s Demand. Now the Words of the Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion run in this Connection, "<hi>Will you give your faithful Diligence</hi> ALWAYS <hi>to miniſter the Doctrine, and Sacraments, and Diſcipline of</hi> CHRIST, [<hi>as the Lord hath commanded, and as</hi> THIS CHURCH and REALM <hi>hath received the ſame, according to the Commandments of God</hi>] SO THAT YOU MAY TEACH THE PEOPLE COMMITTED TO YOUR CARE AND CHARGE <hi>with all Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to keep and obſerve the ſame?</hi> To which the Anſwer made, is this, <hi>"I will do ſo by the Help of the Lord."</hi>—Interpreting then the Anſwer by the Queſtion, it muſt be allow'd, the direct View of this Engagement is to a <hi>particular Charge;</hi> and the End expre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

For if you'll pleaſe to review the <hi>Biſhop's</hi> Queſtion, 'tis obvious, that Mr. <hi>W—d,</hi> in his Anſwer, did not <hi>directly</hi> promiſe (whether ALWAYS, or otherwiſe,) in fact to <hi>miniſter—as this Church and Realm hath received,</hi> &amp;c. but only that he would GIVE HIS FAITHFUL DILIGENCE <hi>always to miniſter</hi>—as aforeſaid.—Neither, did he, in this Place, promiſe ſo much as that <hi>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally</hi> and <hi>indefinitely,</hi> but with an expreſs <hi>Limitation</hi> to THE PEOPLE COMMITTED TO HIS CARE AND CHARGE. A Reſtriction evidently cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in his <hi>Promiſe,</hi> by the ſtrongeſt Implication. So that when in Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence he is <hi>excentrical</hi> to his ſtated <hi>Charge</hi> at any Time, he has a tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Releaſe</hi> from his <hi>Promiſe,</hi> ſo far as relates to his <hi>miniſtring,</hi> or even to his <hi>giving Diligence</hi> to miniſter, according to the <hi>Church Forms.</hi> Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, for Argument's Sake, I will wave the Advantage of thoſe reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Words, and grant that by Parity of Reaſon his Promiſe may oblige him beyond the Limits of his own particular <hi>Charge:</hi> Yet it is poſſible, in ſome Caſes, he may be punctual to his <hi>promiſe</hi> aforeſaid, tho' he actually <hi>miniſter</hi> in the Congregation <hi>without</hi> uſing the Epiſcopal Forms. For is it not a poſſible Caſe, that he may GIVE HIS FAITHFUL DILIGENCE <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to miniſter,</hi> in the Way and Manner of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and yet it be <hi>out of his Power</hi> ſometimes to <hi>miniſter</hi> thus in Fact? For Inſtance, when in his occaſional Travels he comes into a Place peopled wholly with <hi>Diſſenters</hi> from the <hi>Church of England,</hi> who being diſaffected to <hi>Book-pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> would take Offence at his uſing the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> but will gladly receive him <hi>without</hi> it, I don't ſee that his <hi>Promiſe</hi> binds him in this Caſe, to forbear miniſtring <hi>at all,</hi> meerly becauſe the People ſo prejudic'd won't ſuffer him to miniſter in the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Way.—Or, again, ſuppoſing there be <hi>Epiſcopal</hi>

And as "certainly as it ſtands him in ſtead, to <hi>clear up his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter</hi> in this Matter," ſo certainly I think, this Conduct of <hi>Publick Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> at home (whatever Mr. <hi>Garden,</hi> or our <hi>Author</hi> may judge of it) is ſufficient for that purpoſe; and I believe, will be tho't, by the reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and unprejudic'd part of the World, at leaſt ſufficient "to excuſe him [in their Eyes] from aggravated <hi>Prevarication,</hi>" which our <hi>Author</hi> ſays "there are Many who know not how to excuſe him from, to ſay <hi>nothing worſe.</hi>"—What <hi>worſe,</hi> he might think could be ſaid of Mr. <hi>W—d,</hi> I know not: however, this I'm well perſuaded of, that notwithſtanding all the Noiſe about his <hi>violating his Promiſe,</hi> there's <hi>Nothing</hi> in it, but I believe it will be found only groundleſs Jealouſy.

               <p>Our Author, in his next Paragraph (Page 4, &amp; 5.) deals with Mr. <hi>W—d</hi> about his ITINERATION, which he thinks incongruous to the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a <hi>profeſſed Miniſter of the Church of</hi> England, a Breach of his <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination-Commiſſion</hi> from the Biſhop, &amp;c. and therefore <hi>not conſiſtent with Honeſty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have nothing at all to do here, but to conſider this Inſtance of Mr. <hi>W—d'</hi>s Conduct in point of <hi>Conſiſtency,</hi> which is the View under which our <hi>Author</hi> objects to it. The Scope (I think) of the Argument here againſt his <hi>Itinerancy</hi> is, that "<hi>the Authority,</hi> which Mr. <hi>W—d</hi> as a Miniſter of the <hi>Church of England</hi> had given him by the <hi>Biſhop,</hi>" was limited in the Exerciſe of it, to "the <hi>Congregation</hi> where he ſhall be <hi>lawfully appointed</hi> thereto."—To which I ſay, if his <hi>Ordination Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> did <hi>not</hi> give him <hi>Authority,</hi> as well to miniſter <hi>out</hi> of his particular Charge, as <hi>in</hi> it, then we may rationally conclude, his <hi>Ordination-Promiſe</hi> with Relation to the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of that Authority, in uſing the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> reſpected him alſo only <hi>within</hi> his appointed Charge: and in this View of the Caſe, not his <hi>Subſcription,</hi> not the <hi>Articles,</hi> or <hi>Orders,</hi> or <hi>Canons</hi> of the Church, but his <hi>Commiſſion</hi> ought to have been objected to him before, at leaſt to ſhorten the Diſpute: Methinks, this Argument ſingly might have ſtood <hi>inſtar ominum.</hi>—Or, if his <hi>Commiſſion</hi> (in its true Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:005594_0034_10269163FAD130A0"/>
                  <hi>did</hi> empower him to miniſter <hi>out</hi> of his particular <hi>Cure</hi> and <hi>Charge,</hi> then I think our <hi>Author's</hi> Argument from this <hi>Commiſſion</hi> carries no Force with it to condemn his <hi>Itineration.</hi> An Argument which proves <hi>too much,</hi> proves <hi>too little.</hi> But if the Words of the <hi>Commiſſion</hi> be taken exactly in the <hi>Letter,</hi> without allowing a Latitude of Senſe, this would diſempower the Clergy ſo much as to <hi>exchange Pulpits,</hi> or <hi>aſſiſt</hi> one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother occaſionally; for <hi>this,</hi> by the foreſaid Rule of Interpretation, wou'd <hi>violate</hi> their <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> as well as <hi>Itinerancy.</hi> Here's a <hi>Reductio ad abſurdum,</hi> which I believe can't eaſily be ſurmounted: But our <hi>Author</hi> muſt relinquiſh his Plea from the general <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> and fly to a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Licence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And 'tis Fact, by the Conceſſion of Epiſcopal Writers, that the <hi>Biſhops</hi> (as alſo the two Univerſities in <hi>England.</hi>) have the Power to grant <hi>Licences,</hi> of a wider Extent than the narrow Diſtrict of a ſingle Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation or Pariſh, even through the largeſt City, or through a whole Dioceſs, and the <hi>Archbiſhops</hi> through a whole Province, if they pleaſe, to any ordain'd Miniſters they think fit; "who in Virtue of ſuch Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, may travel, if they will, from Place to Place, as <hi>Itinerants.</hi>" The ſending forth <hi>itinerant</hi> Preachers was a Practice in the <hi>Church of England</hi> at the Beginning of the Reformation; probably in ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree has been kept up all along; or if obſolete for any Time, has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably been reviv'd of late Years, particularly with Relation to <hi>foreign Parts.</hi> Mr. <hi>W—d</hi> is not the only Epiſcopal <hi>Itinerant</hi> in <hi>America.</hi> It's well known, that <hi>Itinerant</hi> Miniſters (under this expreſs Denomination) are avow'd by the <hi>Society</hi> at home <hi>for propagating the Goſpel,</hi> who have at this very Time a Number on their Miſſion. Thus "Mr. <hi>Morris</hi> in the Abſtract of their Proceedings, for 1743. is nam'd expreſly ITINERANT Miſſionary in <hi>Connecticut;</hi> Mr. <hi>Punderſon,</hi> ITINERANT Miſſionary in <hi>New-England;</hi> Mr. <hi>Lindſay,</hi> ITINERANT Miſſionary in <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania</hi> and <hi>New-Jerſey,</hi>" with others.—In the general Notion then, Miniſters of this <hi>Character</hi> be judg'd agreeable to the <hi>Conſtitution of the Church of England,</hi> which our <hi>Author</hi> refers us to. We may well think, it's no <hi>Violation</hi> therefore of this original COMMISSION from the Biſhop, to act beyond the Limits of a particular <hi>Cure</hi> or <hi>Charge,</hi> or even in the Character of an <hi>Itinerant.</hi> And with Regard to a ſpecial LI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CENCE, I queſtion whether the <hi>Itinerant Miſſionaries</hi> above-mentioned have had this, any more than Mr. <hi>W—d.</hi> I ſuppoſe they all have the common <hi>Letters of Orders</hi> from the Biſhop: and why <hi>ordain'd</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters mayn't be thought ſufficiently authoriz'd to exerciſe their Office, without ſpecial <hi>Letters of Licence</hi> ſupervening, I cannot well underſtand. Nor does it appear to me a Breach of <hi>Canon,</hi> at leaſt no Infraction upon the <hi>Oath</hi> of Canonical Obedience, to act <hi>without</hi> ſuch a Licence. For
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:005594_0035_1026A833CDC98E68"/>
the <hi>Oath</hi> is of Obedience to the <hi>Biſhop;</hi> not directly to the <hi>Canons.</hi> The <hi>Biſhop</hi> muſt interpoſe his Injunction, or Impoſition, before the <hi>Canon</hi> becomes binding: and even in this Caſe (as I have already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark'd) the <hi>Clergy</hi> apprehend themſelves ſtill in Poſſeſſion of a <hi>diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary</hi> Power with Relation to their own Act of Submiſſion and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; the Tenor of the <hi>Oath</hi> being, to obey the Biſhop only in <hi>omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <p>There's one Thing more ſuggeſted in his LETTER (<hi>pag.</hi> 5,) on this Head of <hi>Conſiſtency,</hi> which brings us back again to the <hi>Article</hi> about <hi>uſing the Book of Common Prayer,</hi> which Mr. <hi>W—d ſubſcrib'd</hi> to, and yet has ſince in a <hi>Journal</hi> made that Remark, "When the <hi>Spirit of Prayer</hi> began to be loſt, then <hi>Forms of Prayer</hi> were invented;" and ſeems by the Connection of what he ſays there, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If Mr. <hi>W—d</hi> in fact has <hi>changed</hi> his Mind about <hi>Forms</hi> in Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I think he may nevertheleſs be <hi>conſiſtent</hi> in <hi>blaming</hi> the Church-Clergy for <hi>violating their Subſcription</hi> to the 39 <hi>Articles:</hi> for theſe were deſign'd to ſecure <hi>Unity</hi> or <hi>Conſent of Faith;</hi> and the Clergy's <hi>Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to theſe leaves them no Liberty to ſpeak or write contrary to what they've ſubſcrib'd; and hence, if in Points of <hi>Faith</hi> they <hi>"change their Minds"</hi> and teach contrary to their <hi>Subſcription,</hi> they are not <hi>"capable of being vindicated in the ſame Way,"</hi> as Mr. <hi>W—d is;</hi> unleſs it is not poſſible for a Man with a ſafe Conſcience ſo much as occaſionally to <hi>uſe</hi> any Forms of Prayer, while yet he has an unfavourable Opinion of the <hi>Riſe</hi> of Forms. For it was only the <hi>Uſe</hi> of the Forms, that is reſpected in the Subſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, according to the Opinion of ſome of the beſt Defenders of the Church. According to their Senſe of the Matter, Mr. <hi>W—d</hi> did not <hi>"ſubſcribe to the Book of Common Prayer",</hi> properly ſpeaking, i. e. did not (as our <hi>Author</hi> repreſents it) "ſubſcribe to <hi>all Things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it."</hi> If you will read (Sir) the Controverſy between Dr.<hi>Cal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="37" facs="unknown:005594_0036_1026A83558A17F08"/>
only to the <hi>Uſe,</hi> not the <hi>Impoſition</hi> of them. Mr. <hi>W—d</hi> therefore hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubſcrib'd only to the <hi>Uſe</hi> of the Liturgy, might without <hi>violating</hi> his Subſcription alter his Mind about the <hi>Riſe</hi> of Forms, ſo long as this Change of Sentiment does not affect the <hi>Article</hi> he ſubſcrib'd to, and is not ſuch in its Nature as to be inconſiſtent with all <hi>Uſe</hi> of them, while he thinks the <hi>Matter</hi> of the Prayers <hi>agreeable to the Word of God,</hi> and the Caſe ſuch as makes Submiſſion to the <hi>Uſe</hi> of them expedient.—Whereas the Clergy's preaching contrary to, and condemning any of the 39 <hi>Articles,</hi> deſtroys <hi>Conſent of Faith,</hi> ſubverts the very End of their <hi>Subſcription,</hi> is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Violation of their <hi>Subſcription,</hi> and does not well conſiſt with their not renouncing it.</p>
               <p>But indeed I ſee no Neceſſity of ſuppoſing a <hi>Change</hi> of Sentiment in Mr. <hi>W—d.</hi> For notwithſtanding an unfavourable Opinion about the <hi>Riſe</hi> of Forms of Prayer, yet ſo long as that Opinion was only ſuch as might conſiſt with the lawful <hi>uſing</hi> them, in ſome Circumſtances, he might look on himſelf at <hi>Liberty</hi> notwithſtanding, to <hi>ſubſcribe</hi> to the <hi>Uſe</hi> of the Liturgy WITHIN THE CHURCH AND REALM, and might judge it <hi>expedient</hi> in his Caſe. For, as he might poſſibly be acted with a View to ſome peculiar <hi>Advantages</hi> (as he thought) to ſerve the Ends of the Miniſtry, within the Pale of the <hi>Eſtabliſhment,</hi> Particularly in regard <hi>Epiſcopal Orders</hi> might "render his Miniſtry more currant &amp; indiſputable and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble among the Generality of the People of <hi>England:</hi>" So perhaps he was partly inclined to ſeek Admiſſion into <hi>publick Miniſtry,</hi> upon Principle in Relation to <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> which he might be ſtrongly attach'd to, more than to the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and might at the ſame Time think his Sentiment about the <hi>Riſe</hi> of Forms of Prayer not a ſufficient Ground of <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> from the <hi>Church of England.</hi> Theſe and other Conſiderations, of Weight with him to perſuade to his Continuance in the Communion of the <hi>Church,</hi> might more than counter balance his Opinion about the Occaſion of <hi>Forms</hi> being <hi>invented:</hi> eſpecially when by his <hi>Subſcription</hi> to the <hi>Uſe</hi> of them in Publick Prayer, he would obtain the valuable Liberty (as he thought) of miniſtring in the <hi>Publick Churches,</hi> which he could not enjoy without complying with the Terms of the Legal Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment; and eſpecially too when his <hi>Subſcription</hi> intended nothing more than a Declaration of <hi>Aſſent</hi> and <hi>Conſent</hi> to the <hi>Uſe</hi> of the impos'd Forms, with an <hi>Approbation</hi> of them only in Relation to their <hi>Matter,</hi> and to their <hi>Uſe</hi> in this Caſe of their <hi>impoſition.</hi> For thus ſays the learned Mr. O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Alluding now to our <hi>Author'</hi>s Concluſion upon this laſt Head, I finiſh with expreſſing my fervent Wiſhes for us all, both Miniſters and People, that we may have more of the <hi>wiſdom which is from above,</hi> and may have <hi>this for our Rejoycing,</hi> even <hi>the Teſtimony of our Conſcience, that in Simplicity and godly Sincerity, not with fleſhly Wiſdom, but by the Grace of God, we have our Converſation in the World:</hi> then, I believe, however we may differ in Sentiment, in ſome Caſes of leſſer Importance, we ſhall not divide in Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
