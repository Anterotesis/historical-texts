         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                        <p>THE priſoners at the bar, are that party of ſoldiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to his Majeſty's 29th regiment, who in the evening of the 5th of <hi>March</hi> laſt, were induced from ſome cauſe or other to fire on the inhabitants of this town, in <hi>King ſtreet.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>They are charged in five diſtinct indictments, with the wilful premeditated murder of five different perſons mentioned in the reſpective bills; to each of theſe indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they have ſeverally pleaded, <hi>not guilty</hi>; and by that plea have thrown upon the crown the burthen of proving the fact alledged againſt them: It is my province therefore to give you evidence in ſupport of this charge, and yours, gentlemen of the Jury, to determine whether they are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or not.</p>
                        <p>The cauſe is ſolemn and important; no leſs than whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eight of your fellow ſubjects ſhall live or die! A cauſe grounded on the moſt melancholy event that has yet taken place on the continent of <hi>America,</hi> and perhaps of the greateſt expectation of any that has yet come before a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal of civil juſtice, in this part of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> dominions.</p>
                        <p>I am aware how difficult, in caſes of this ſort, it ever is, and more eſpecially ſo in <hi>theſe times,</hi> and in <hi>this trial,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the mind perfectly indifferent; but I remember, we are bound, not only by the natural obligations towards God and man, but alſo by an oath, to examine into the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of fact without <hi>partiality</hi> or <hi>prejudice;</hi> I need not therefore caution you of your duty in this reſpect: It is upon that evidence and the law reſulting from it, you gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen are, in the language of your oath, to give a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict; and I will venture, before hand, to pronounce that verdict <hi>righteous,</hi> if it is founded in theſe principles as the rule of your judgment.</p>
                        <p>It has become my duty, it ſhall therefore be my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor, to acquit myſelf in the courſe of this trial with
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011683_0006_0F87C824B7E3F7D8"/>
                           <hi>decency</hi> and <hi>candour;</hi> reflecting, that however intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the queſtion may be, the object of our enquiry is ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that of truth, and that this enquiry is to be conducted by the wiſdom of the laws and conſtitution.</p>
                        <p>In ſupport of this accuſation againſt the priſoners at the bar, it is incumbent on the crown, to aſcertain the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things; viz. The indentity of the perſons charged; the fact of killing; and the circumſtances attending and aggravating that fact.</p>
                        <p>To this end, I ſhall immediately produce to you ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, from the teſtimony of credible witneſſes, as may be ſufficient to ſuſtain the ſeveral indictments, and when I have gone through the examination, make ſuch remarks upon it, as may be moſt conciſe and pertinent to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent iſſue.</p>

               <p>It was <hi>White.</hi> He was ſtanding Sentry at the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe</hi>: he ſpoke to me, and aſked me how we all did at home. I immediately went home. Soon after I heard the bells ring, and went into <hi>King-ſtreet.</hi> When I came there, the ſoldiers were drawn up by the <hi>Main Guard.</hi>

               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p>Was you in <hi>King-ſtreet</hi> that evening the 5th <hi>March?</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Yes. The bells began to ring, and the people cryed fire: I run with the reſt, and went into <hi>King-ſtreet</hi>; I aſked where the fire was; I was told there was no fire, but that the ſoldiers at <hi>Murray</hi>'s barracks had got out, and had been fighting with the inhabitants, but that they had drove them back again. I went to the barracks, and found the affair was over there. I came back, and juſt as I got to the Town pump, I ſaw twenty or five and twenty boys going into <hi>King-ſtreet.</hi> I went into <hi>King-ſtreet</hi> myſelf, and ſaw ſeveral boys and young men about the Sentry box at the <hi>Cuſtom houſe.</hi> I aſked them what was the matter. They ſaid the Sentry had knocked down a boy. They crowded in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the gutter; I told them to let the Sentry alone. He went up the ſteps of the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe,</hi> and knocked at the door, but could not get in. I told him not to be afraid, they were only boys, and would not hurt him.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>They were as far as the gutter, and he went up the ſteps and called out, but what he ſaid I do not remember.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I do not know; when he went up the ſteps he levelled his piece with his bayonet fixed. As I was talking with the Sentry, and telling him not to be afraid, the ſoldiers came down, and when they came, I drew back from the Sentry towards <hi>Royal-exchange lane,</hi> and there I ſtood. I did not ſee them load, but ſomebody ſaid, are you loaded; and <hi>Samuel Gray,</hi> who was ſhot that night, came and ſtruck me on the ſhoulder, and ſaid, <hi>Langford,</hi> what's here to pay.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I ſaid I did not know what was to pay, but I believed ſomething would come of it by and bye. He made no reply. Immediately a gun went off. I was within reach of their guns and bayonets; one of them thruſt at me with his bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onet, and run it through my jacket and great coat.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>

               <p>About fourteen or fifteen years old, perhaps ſome of them older, I ſaw no men there except one, who came up <hi>Royal-exchange lane</hi> with me, thinking it was fire. He went back again.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I think he was upon the right of them. As they came down they had their guns charged breaſt high. I ſaw <hi>Chriſtopher Monk,</hi> who was wounded that night, I turned to ſpeak to him, and directly they fired, and he ſeemed to faulter. I ſaid are you wounded, he ſaid yes. I replied, I do not think it, for I then apprehended they fired only powder.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; <hi>Montgomery</hi> was knocked down with a ſtick, and his gun flew out of his hand, and when he recovered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf he diſcharged his gun.</p>

               <p>I do not know, but the man that ſtood the third from the right was <hi>Carrol,</hi> and I believe he was the next that fired</p>

The bells ſtill ringing made me proceed up <hi>Royal-exchange lane</hi> with a number of other perſons: I out run them and came to the head of the lane, there being no perſon there but a ſoldier who was the Sentry, the other Inhabitants coming up, they cryed out there is a ſoldier and huzza'd.

               <p>Not ſo as to know them again. That evening, at the cry of fire, I came out of my houſe, and ſaw the people running down town, and I followed them; when I got by the <hi>Town-houſe,</hi> I ſaw ſome going down <hi>King-ſtreet,</hi> I went down alſo: At the <hi>Guard houſe,</hi> I ſaw a number of the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers running; I aſked where was the fire, no body anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me. I went down to the middle of <hi>King-ſtreet,</hi> and while I ſtood there, was puſhed from behind me with a bayonet. I turned round and ſaw a party of ſoldiers coming down, I aſked one the reaſon of his puſhing at me? he dumn'd my blood, and bid me ſtand out of their way, I ſaid I would not, I was doing no harm to any man, and would not ſtand aſide for any one; they paſſed me ſome on one ſide, ſome on the other. They came to the Sentry-box, faced round and formed a circle. I ſpoke to ſome of the inhabitants to ſpeak to <hi>Preſton,</hi> to know what the matter was; ſome body ſpoke to him, but what was ſaid, I do not know. I ſaw <hi>Preſton</hi> fall in betwixt the fourth and fifth man, the word was given fire! immediately the right hand man fired; after that I puſhed in towards them, and they run a bayonet at me and wounded me in my arm.</p>

               <p>I was walking right before them.

A little boy run along and cryed, fire! fire! fire! as people generally do when there is fire, a ſoldier pointed his gun to him and fired, but did not hit him, he was the laſt but one on the left.</p>

After the firing ceaſed, a little boy came and told us ſome perſons were killed. I ſaw them lye in the ſtreet, but I did not imagine it was any body killed, but that they had been ſcared and run away, and left their great coat's behind them: I ſaw nothing like an attack that could produce any ſuch conſequences: I went to look at the Malatto man, and heard a noiſe like the cocking of fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks,

               <p>No On Friday Mr. <hi>John Gray</hi> told me to go to his rope-walk to make ſome cables; I went and worked till about twelve, and then I ſaw a ſoldier coming down the outſide rope-walk, ſwearing, and ſaying he would have ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Before this there was one of our hands while I was coiling a cable, ſaid to a ſoldier do you want work, yes, lays the ſoldier I do faith; well ſaid he to the ſoldier, go clean

my little-houſe, he damned us and made a blow at, and ſtruck me, when I knocked up his heels, his coat flew open and out dropt a naked cutleſs, which I took up and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off with me. He went away, and came back with a dozen ſoldiers with him: the people that were attacked called to us for help. When they called to us, we came up; then we had ſeveral knocks amongſt us, at laſt they went off. They all got armed with clubs, and in the afternoon they were coming again, but Mr. <hi>John Gray</hi> ſtopped them.</p>

I went into <hi>King-ſtreet,</hi> and ſaw nobody there, the Sentry was walking as uſual. We agreed to go home. I went towards home, and ſtopped at the bottom of <hi>Long lane,</hi> and while I was talking there, I heard guns go off. I went to <hi>King-ſtreet,</hi> and was told ſeveral were killed, I then went home. <hi>Samuel Gray,</hi> when I ſaw him that night, was quite calm, and had no ſtick.</p>

I had ſeen two ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers about my houſe, I ſaw one of them hearkening at the window, I ſaw him again near the houſe, and aſked him
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:011683_0024_0F87C8385C723618"/>
what he was after; he ſaid he was pumping ſhip: Was it not you, ſays I, that was hearkening at my window laſt night? what if it was, he ſaid, I told him to march off, and he damned me, and I beat him till he had enough of it, and he then went off. The reaſon of carrying the ſword, was, they ſpyed the young man in the lane, and dogg'd him, for he had been very active in the affray at the Rope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walks, and they ſaid they would ſome time or other have ſatisfaction, and I looked upon myſelf to be liable to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted likewiſe. When alarmed by the cry of fine, and I had got below the houſe, my wife called after me, and ſaid it is not fire, it is an affray in <hi>King-ſtreet,</hi> if you are going take this, ſo I took it, and run down, and I aſked the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier what I juſt now told you. I knocked the bayonet with what I had in my hand, another puſhed at me, I ſtruck his gun; my face was now towards the ſoldiers. I heard the firſt gun go off, and then the ſecond gun went off. As I was looking to ſee if any body was killed, I ſaw the tall man ſtanding in a line with me. I ſaw him fall.</p>

Somebody ſaid, do not preſs on the ſoldiers, I repeated the ſame words, do not preſs on the ſoldiers: when I ſaid that, I ſaw ſomething like a flaſh at my left, and heard the report of a gun, and the people o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened from right to left; but I could not ſee where the gun was fired from; it made a noiſe like a piſtol, and I i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined it was nothing but powder. As the people croud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the lane, it took the view of the right hand ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers from me, but I had a view of the left. I heard ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gun go off, and ſaw a man fall.</p>

               <p>On the evening of the 5th <hi>March,</hi> a little after nine, I was ſitting in my houſe, I heard a conſiderable noiſe in the ſtreet, I liſtened a little, and found it continued, I went to the door, I found the chief of the noiſe was at the bottom of the ſtreet, I enquired the reaſon, I was told the ſoldiers and inhabitants were fighting; I waited at the door a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute or two, people were running down in two's and three's at a time, at length the noiſe ſubſided, and ſeemed to be down by <hi>Dock-ſquare</hi>; I heard the bells ring and heard the cry of fire, I aſked where it was? I was anſwered there was none, but the inhabitants and ſoldiers fighting. Deacon <hi>Marſh</hi> came out, and there came a party of ſoldiers from the ſouthward, ten or twelve I think, they had ſhort cloths I think, I ſaw ſome white ſlieves amongſt them with bayo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets in their hands, but I apprehended no danger from them; I ſtood on the ſtep of the door, they appeared to be puſhing right down the ſtreet, when they got a few rods from the door, their courſe began to bend towards us, ſtill I apprehended nothing but that they were coming to walk on the ſide of the way, then they lifted up their weapons, and I began to apprehend danger, they ſaid ſomething. I do not know what it was, but I went in as fall as I could, and ſhut the door immediately. They were within half a foot of it, had it been open a ſecond longer they would have had the command of the door, but I was too quick for them and bolted my door, went up chamber, looked out of my window, and ſaw people flying here and

there like pidgeons, and the ſoldiers running about like mad men in a fury till they got to the bottom of the ſtreet.</p>

Coming by <hi>Jenkins</hi>'s alley my little brother with me, there came out about twenty ſoldiers with cutlaſſes in their hands, my brother fell and they run paſt him, and were going to kill me, I ſaid ſoldiers ſpare my life, one of them ſaid no damn you, we will kill you all; he lifted his cutlaſs and ſtruck at my head, but I dodged and got the blow on my ſhoulder.</p>

               <p>I was at Col <hi>Jackſon</hi>'s a few minutes after nine on the 5th of <hi>March.</hi> When I came out into <hi>Dock ſquare,</hi> the ſquare was entirely quiet, I ſaw no perſons in the whole ſquare. I came up <hi>Royal exchange-lane,</hi> I ſaw nobody there. I ſaw the Sentry at the head of it in peace and quietneſs, nobody trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling him: I never ſaw <hi>King-ſtreet</hi> more quiet in my life. I went into my houſe, where was a kinſman of mine; I aſked him how he did, and while I was ſpeaking the young man in the ſhop knocked for me, I went into the ſhop, and in a half a minute, I heard the cry of murder once or twice; there is miſchief ſaid I, at a diſtance, ſo there is ſaid he; I opened the front door to ſee, I ſaw nobody. I heard a ſad noiſe, which ſeemed to come from <hi>Rowe</hi>'s bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racks. I ſtopped a little ſpace, and the firſt I ſaw enter <hi>King-ſtreet,</hi> was a party from the <hi>Main-Guard,</hi> ten or twelve came ruſhing out violently, I ſaw their arms glitter by the moon light, hallowing damn them where are they, by Jeſus let them come. Some of them turned into <hi>Pudding-lane,</hi> and ſome went by the <hi>Town-houſe</hi> ſteps; I went in and told my family to keep themſelves eaſy, for there was no diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance near the houſe. I went to the door again, and ſaw a party about the head of <hi>Quaker-lane,</hi> and they uſed much
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:011683_0027_0F87C83DA0E00400"/>
the ſame expreſſions as the aforeſaid party, and hallowed fire. They paſſed over the way, and the ſhade of the moon light hindered me to ſee if they went down <hi>Royal-exchange-lane</hi> or went up towards the <hi>Town-houſe</hi> Something ſtrikes my mind, I am not poſitive now, but I think it was that night, there were a few boys round the Sentry. I went and ſaid, boys you have no buſineſs with the Sentry, go off, and they went off. I have often ſeen boys with the Sentry, and heard words often. The bells were then ringing, and the people began to collect as they do at the cry of fire, and I began to think it was fire. I had a mind to get my ſtaff and go out, but I had a reluctance, becauſe I had been warned not to go out that night: but while the people were collecting, I came to the door, and ſaw them gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thick from all quarters, forty, fifty or ſixty. When the party came down, I thought it was no more than I had ſeen every day, I thought they had come to relieve the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, they ſeemed to be in a poſture of defence, and came through the people. I ſaw no oppoſition. When they came up, they paſſed out of the moon light into the dark, ſo that I could not ſee them, but I wondered to find them tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſo long. I heard a gun go off, I thought it was an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, but in a little time another gun went off, and a third and fourth, pretty quick, and then the fifth. There ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a ſmall ſtop in their firing, I than had no concern, but before the ſmoke was well away, I ſaw the people dead on the ground. I ſaw no oppoſition when they were drawn up, the people were not near them; what oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might be at the lane I could not perceive, becauſe the box covered that from my view.</p>

                        <p>HAVING gone through the evidence on the part of the crown, it is my province to ſupport the charge againſt the priſoners.

                        <p>There are two things neceſſary to prove, which I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the firſt opening of this cauſe, namely, the iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the priſoners, that is, that they were that party of men who on the 5th of <hi>March</hi> laſt were in <hi>King-ſtreet,</hi> and that they committed the facts mentioned in the indictments, and farther gentlemen, the circumſtances attending and aggravating the commiſſion of thoſe facts.</p>
                        <p>As to the firſt point, to prove the identity of the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, all of them have been ſworn to, and moſt of them by more than one witneſs.</p>

                        <p>All theſe witneſſes as I have mentioned them to you, have teſtified on oath to the ſeveral priſoners, that they were that evening in <hi>King-ſtreet,</hi> and of the party; the next thing to be enquired into gentlemen is as to the facts. In order to aſcertain theſe it will be neceſſary to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the teſtimony of the witneſſes. I could have wiſhed I had been able, after the fatigue of yeſterday, to have ranged the evidence in the order of time as the facts took place; but not being able to do this, I muſt take them up as the witneſſes were examined. I will however endeavour to ſtate the facts in the beſt arrangement I can.</p>
                        <p>The firſt witneſs Mr. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> ſays, that he was in <hi>King-ſtreet</hi> that evening, near the Sentry-box which was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe</hi>; that about a quarter after nine he ſaw the party coming from the <hi>Main-guard</hi>; when they got down to the Sentry box, they wheeled to the left and formed themſelves round it; and in coming round <hi>M'Cauley</hi> puſhed at him with his bayonet, damned him, and bid him to ſtand off, this was the firſt inſtance of their conduct. Mr. <hi>Auſtin</hi> was not paticular who fired, his back being towards the ſoldiers when that happened. He ſays there were five or ſix guns fired; and he ſaw <hi>M'Cauley</hi> after the firing. Theſe are the moſt material circumſtances of his teſtimony.</p>
                        <p>The next witneſs is <hi>Bridgham,</hi> who ſays he was in <hi>King-ſtreet</hi> alſo; and the next morning when he went to the goal to view the priſoners, he apprehended he had ſeen <hi>Warren</hi> in <hi>King ſtreet</hi> the evening before, but afterwards he ſaw a perſon that looked very like him belonging to the ſame regiment, which occaſioned him to doubt whether he was the man or not; my remark upon this, is, it was probable that the firſt impreſſions made on his mind were the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and therefore you cannot well doubt he was right in judging that <hi>Warren</hi> was in fact the perſon he ſaw the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening before; he ſaw alſo <hi>Wemms</hi> the corporal ſtationed on the left of the party betwixt him and the tall man; the <hi>Corporal</hi> was on the left entire, if ſo gentlemen, <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren</hi>
                           <pb n="56" facs="unknown:011683_0029_0F87C840245E7490"/>
muſt have been the third man from the left in that ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation; there were a number of people he ſays round the party huzzaing, ſome having ſticks; his face was the other way when the firſt gun went off, he heard a noiſe like the claſhing of guns, he ſaw <hi>Gray</hi> fall, and ſays the perſon that killed him, muſt have been near the center of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; when the left man fired there were but few in the ſtreet, they divided and were paſſing off; the laſt man that fired, he ſays leveled his piece, following a lad that was running down the ſtreet before he fired; he alſo mentions a number of people coming down from the north ſide of the <hi>Town-houſe,</hi> collected as he ſuppoſed by the bells, and not diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to commit any injury whatſoever; he did not apprehend himſelf, or the ſoldiers in any danger from any thing he obſerved; he ſays about ſeven guns were fired, and there were about twelve people at that time before the party.— Theſe are the moſt material circumſtances in his evidence.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Dodge</hi> ſays, he ſaw <hi>Warren,</hi> but cannot ſwear to any of the reſt, the man who fired firſt he thinks ſtood towards the left, about two from the corner, however he was over at <hi>Vernon</hi>'s ſhop acroſs the ſtreet, and perhaps not able to make ſo good obſervations as ſome others; he ſaw about fifty people in the ſtreet, but he ſaw nothing in their hands; he ſaw a number of ſnow balls thrown, but none as he obſerved with violence or in anger; he ſaw the people near the party of ſoldiers, and they puſhing at them with their bayonets; he does not imagine there was any thing beſides ſnow balls thrown.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Clark</hi> the next witneſs, ſaw <hi>White</hi> the Sentinel at his ſtation juſt before nine o'clock, that he ſpoke to him, but ſaw no one at that time near or moleſting him.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Langford</hi> comes next, and this witneſs is perhaps as particular as any one witneſs on the part of the Crown; it appears by the relation of his evidence that he came down about nine o'clock as a watchman, in order to go to the <hi>Watch-houſe</hi> next adjoining the <hi>Town houſe</hi>; when he came down, he was told the people and ſoldiers were fighting at <hi>Murray</hi>'s <hi>Barracks;</hi> upon this, he took his courſe that way, but the matter being over by the time h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> he need not fear, the boys would not hurt him; ſoon after this the Sentinel without ſaying any thing to the people
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:011683_0029_0F87C840245E7490"/>
went up the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe</hi> ſteps and knocked at the door; a perſon within opened it and ſaid ſomething, but what, the witneſs did not hear; upon that the Sentinel turned round, and pointed his piece at the people oppoſite to him. <hi>Langford</hi> ſpoke again, and told him there was no danger, the boys would not hurt him, and he ſhouldered. The witneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued talking with the Sentry till the party came down, and then he went into the ſtreet. About this time <hi>Gray,</hi> one of the unhappy ſufferers, came and clapped <hi>Langford</hi> on the ſhoulder, ſaying what's here to pay? <hi>Langford</hi> replies, I do not know, but ſomething I believe will come of it by and by; his ſtand was half way as he ſaid betwixt the Sentry-box and <hi>Royal exchange-lane</hi>; the box being on the right corner of the lane, and he oppoſite the center of the lane; the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and <hi>Gray</hi> were ſtanding together talking familiarly, <hi>Langford</hi> leaning on his ſtick, and <hi>Gray</hi> ſtanding with his hands folded in his boſom, without a ſtick in his hand, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaying or doing any thing to the ſoldiers You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but recollect Gentlemen, that this witneſs was expreſsly and repeatedly aſked, if <hi>Gray</hi> had a ſtick, or ſaid any thing to the ſoldiers? he as often anſwered no. <hi>Langford</hi> ſpoke to <hi>Killroy,</hi> and after two guns were diſcharged, ſeeing him preſent his piece, ſaid to him, damn you are you going to fire? Preſently upon this, <hi>Killroy</hi> levelled his piece, and firing directly at <hi>Gray,</hi> killed him dead on the ſpot! The ball paſſed through his head, and he fell on <hi>Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>'s left foot; upon which, not ſatisfied with having mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered one of his fellow creatures in that cruel and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man manner, he puſhed with his bayonet, and pierced <hi>Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> through his great coat and jacket; here Gentlemen, if any there can be, is evidence, and I think compleat evidence of a heart deſperately wicked, and bent upon miſchief, the true characteriſtic of a wilful malicious murderer.</p>
                        <p>It could not be thought, at the diſtance the witneſs and <hi>Gray</hi> were ſtanding from him, without offering any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, but <hi>Killroy</hi> the priſoner ſaw them diſtinctly, and ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to deſtroy them; if you compare this teſtimony with Mr. <hi>Hemmingway</hi>'s who ſwears to <hi>Killroy</hi>'s uttering expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſious importing, that he would miſs no opportunity of fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the inhabitants, he had wiſhed for it ever ſince he landed, you certainly Gentlemen can have no doubt in your minds but that he had that intention at heart, and took this opportunity to execute it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="58" facs="unknown:011683_0030_0F87C841185B90B0"/>The crime of murder, Gentlemen, it will be agreed by all, neceſſarily involves in it the malice of the heart, and that malice is to be collected from the circumſtances atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the action; but it is not neceſſary to conſtitute ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, that it ſhould be harboured long in the breaſt; a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction is made in the books betwixt malice and hatred, and a good diſtinction it is; I have it in my hand and will read it;</p>
                        <p>KELYNCE 126, and 127. MAWGRIDGE's CASE.
<q>Some have been led into miſtake by not well conſidering what the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of malice is; they have conſtrued it to be a rancour of mind lodged in the perſon killing, for ſome conſiderable time before the commiſſion of the fact, which is a miſtake ariſing from their not well diſtinguiſhing between <hi>hatred</hi> and <hi>malice,</hi>
                           </q>
And a little after,
<q>Malice is a deſign formed of doing miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to another; <hi>cum quis data opera male agit,</hi> he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and uſeth the means to do ill is malicious: <hi>2 Inſt. 42.</hi> He that doth a cruel act voluntarily, doth it of malice propenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</q>
3 Inſt. 62.</p>
                        <p>Though Gentlemen, it happens on a ſudden occaſion as this was, if the act is in it's nature wanton and cruel, the law will preſume it to be malicious, unleſs that preſumption is taken off by contrary evidence.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ferriter,</hi> who teſtified to the ſame perſon, tells you, he was remarkably active at the Rope walks amongſt the reſt of the ſoldiers; taking therefore all the circumſtances of this teſtimony together, it muſt remove every ſort of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in your minds as to the purpoſe <hi>Killroy</hi> had at that time; it ſeems apparent that there were ſtrong marks of malice in his heart; the perſon you can have no doubt of, the fact you can have no doubt of, nor can you I think doubt of the ſpecies of crime.</p>
                        <p>The next witneſs, who alſo teſtifies to <hi>Killroy</hi>'s going down, and being of the party, ſwears that he was about twenty feet from the party when the firſt gun was fired; that he alſo had been, previous to this, at <hi>Murray</hi>'s barracks, when the affray happened there, and tells you the behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the ſoldiers in that ſcene.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Brewer,</hi> another witneſs alſo ſwears to <hi>Killroy.</hi> He ſaw the Sentinel on the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe</hi> ſteps; at that time there were about twenty people, boys chiefly about fourteen, and ſome younger, round about him, but they made no great ſhow; he ſaw the Captain come down with the
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:011683_0030_0F87C841185B90B0"/>
party, the Sentinel at this time had his gun breaſt high; that while the witneſs was ſpeaking to <hi>Monk,</hi> (a young lad who was wounded) he loſt ſight of <hi>Preſton</hi> and the guns went off: <hi>Monk</hi> complained of being ſhot, but <hi>Brewer</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended it was nothing but powder, and that he was more frightened than hurt; the firing began at the right and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the corner man on the left. <hi>Killroy</hi> attacked this witneſs in the ſame manner <hi>M'Cauley</hi> did <hi>Auſtin,</hi> by puſhing at him with his bayonet; a number were collected by the ringing of the bells, but he heard nothing particular in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to abuſive language; he ſaw no ſnow balls thrown, and when the ſoldiers came down, he heard ſome of the people crying fire, and that was the general cry; ſome crying fire becauſe the bells rung, ſome, no doubt fire, to the ſoldiers, daring them to it; but of this no great can be made in the preſent caſe. There were ſeven guns he ſays fired, he was certain as to the number, having counted them himſelf. He ſays further, he met Dr. <hi>Young</hi> in <hi>Dock-ſquare</hi> and that he had a ſword; the witneſs ſaid, let every man go to his own home, and the Doctor replied, that is the beſt way, the ſoldiers are gone to their barracks: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſomething will be attempted to be made of this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, and therefore I ſhall make an obſervation upon it.—If you attend to the teſtimony of ſeveral of the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, there were that evening in the ſtreets at all parts of the town, a number of ſoldiers; they failled out from <hi>Murray</hi>'s barracks and every where with clubs, cutlaſſes, and other weapons of death; this occaſioned a general alarm; every man therefore had a right, and very prudent it was to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to defend himſelf if attacked; this accounts for the reaſon of Dr. <hi>Young</hi> or any one inhabitant of the town having a ſword that evening; the Doctor ſurely could not be ſuppoſed to have any intention of miſchief, becauſe the ſame witneſs tells you his cry was, the ſoldiers were gone to their barracks, and go every man to his own home.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Bailey</hi> the next witneſs, teſtifies as to the identity of ſome of the party, that there were <hi>Montgomery, Carrol</hi> and <hi>White</hi> there; that he placed himſelf at the poſt by the <hi>Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom-Houſe,</hi> and ſtood there all the time; that there were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout twenty boys, ſome fourteen years old, and ſome under that; he was near the Sentinel when the party came down; <hi>Carrol</hi> pointed at his breaſt with his bayonet, and <hi>White</hi> ſaid do not hurt him; that <hi>Montgomery</hi> diſcharged his piece firſt;

From this witneſs you aſcertain, Gentlemen, that <hi>Montgomery</hi> fired firſt, and that he was on the right wing of the party.</p>
                        <p>The next witneſs is Mr. <hi>Palmes,</hi> he ſaw the Sentry, and nobody near him: He had come from <hi>Murray</hi>'s barracks, and hearing a diſturbance in <hi>King-ſtreet,</hi> he was told he had better not go down, he ſaid I will, and try to make peace; he <hi>alſo</hi> ſaw <hi>Montgomery</hi> there; the ſtick that ſtruck <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery</hi> was <hi>thrown</hi> as he apprehended; <hi>Montgomery</hi> ſtept back and then fired; he thinks he heard ſeven or eight guns, but did not count them, and it was ſeven or eight ſeconds between the firſt and ſecond gun; as the laſt gun went off, <hi>Montgomery</hi> puſhed at him with his bayonet, and he ſtruck him with his cane, and ſtruck the gun down; the bayonet ſtuck in the ſnow, and the gun fell out of his hand; Mr. <hi>Palmes</hi> at this time ſlipt and fell, but quickly recovered himſelf; <hi>Montgomery</hi> attempted again to puſh him with his bayonet, and he threw his cane at him and run; not ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this, <hi>Montgomery</hi> attempted to puſh him a third time, and in that attempt he ſlipt and fell, and thereby gave <hi>Palmes</hi> an opportunity to get out of his way, or elſe he ſays he had been run through the body; from the teſtimony of this witneſs, you have further proof that <hi>Montgomery</hi> was the perſon who fired firſt; that after firing, he continued to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover marks of malice and malevolence, by puſhing with his bayonet, and endeavouring to deſtroy not only Mr. <hi>Palmes,</hi> but all around him.</p>
                        <p>Next comes Mr <hi>Danbrook,</hi> he ſaw there <hi>Hartegan, Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery,</hi> and <hi>Carrol.</hi> Here is another witneſs to three of the party; it was about a quarter after nine when he came up; he ſtood about ten or twelve feet from <hi>Montgomery;</hi> he ſaw no
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:011683_0031_0F87C8417828B198"/>
ſtick ſtrke him, but a little ſtick he ſays flew over their heads, which he took to be a piece of a rattan; he was look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on <hi>Montgomery</hi> when he fired; this is another evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as to the fact of firing, upon which, the witneſs thinks, two men ſell: if that was the caſe, there was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution indeed; by the diſcharge of one gun two perſons killed on the ſpot! He did not hear the ſecond gun, but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, that by one of the guns <hi>Attucks</hi> fell, he ſtooped to ſee if the Molatto was dead, then turned round and ſaw another man fall; <hi>Attucks</hi> at that time was near him, at his left, leaning on his ſtick; that circumſtance I would have you keep in your minds Gentlemen, that you may remember it when you have the whole evidence together.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Jedediah Baſs</hi> is the next witneſs, he came up <hi>Royal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change-lane</hi>; when he got into <hi>King ſtreet,</hi> he ſaw <hi>Montgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery</hi> there: here Gentlemen is another witneſs as to the iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of one of the priſoners, and the witneſs ſaw him puſh his bayonet at a man that ſtood near him; he drew back into the lane, and in a minute <hi>Montgomery</hi> fired: the number of guns he took to be ſix, but did not count them: the people began on the firing of the firſt gun to run, ſome one way and ſome another. As he came up <hi>Dock ſquare,</hi> the people were ſaying let us go home, there is no fire, the ſoldiers are gone to their barracks.</p>
                        <p>After this witneſs comes Mr. <hi>Wilkinſon,</hi> who gave a very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular account; he tells you he was at his own houſe when the bells rung for nine as uſual; a little while after that he heard Dr. <hi>Cooper</hi>'s bell, on which apprehending it was for fire, he put on his ſurrour, and went out; he came towards the <hi>Town-Houſe,</hi> went paſt it as far as the town-pump, and the people from the windows were cautioning thoſe in the ſtreet not to go down, for they would be killed; the night was ſo bright that he was able where he was to ſee down the ſtreet as far as <hi>Boyſton's alley,</hi> and there he ſaw a number of ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers ſallying out, brandiſhing their ſwords, and contending with the people; there were about thirty or forty round them with buckets and bags, thinking as he ſuppoſed that the bells rung for fire; after this he went to the <hi>Guard-houſe,</hi> intending to wait there, to learn if any miſchief had been done at the barracks; he preſently ſaw Capt. <hi>Preſton</hi> come down, as he imagined from behind the <hi>Old Brick</hi> meeting-houſe, and call to the guard, and ordered them to turn out; then he ſaw the party come out, and ſaw the <hi>Captain</hi>
                           <pb n="62" facs="unknown:011683_0032_0F87C84588AF09A8"/>
draw his ſword and march down with them; at that time there were about thirty or forty people in <hi>King ſtreet</hi>; he went a little lower, and turned back again round the north ſide of the <hi>Town houſe,</hi> and placed himſelf at the <hi>Royal-exchange-tavern</hi>; and the party was formed when he got there: he tells you he was not at all apprehenſive of danger, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently he was capable of making obſervations, and placed himſelf in ſuch a ſituation as to do it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the party formed in a circle, and he ſtood about four or five minutes, before he heard the word given to fire: that he heard it twice: on the firſt command they did not fire; it was repeated, and then the guns went off one after another, like the ſtriking of a clock, he was about two yards from them and thinks the firing began at the right. This correſponds with the the teſtimony of ſeveral witneſſes. He ſaw the flaſh of each gun ſeven went off, and one flaſhed. There Gentlemen you have evidence of all the party's firing ſave one: the witneſs was aſked if he ſaw ſnow balls, ice, oyſter ſhells, or any thing elſe thrown by the people, to which he anſwered No; he ſaid if he had, he ſhould have thought himſelf in danger, and have retreated; he heard two or three cheers before the party came down, <hi>but none afterwards.</hi> Now, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, if you recollect that circumſtance, and the manner of his relating it, you will remember he expreſſed himſelf ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry emphatically: from this teſtimony you have further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs evidence of the fact of firing, that it came from the right, and from thence followed on to the left: he did not ſee the perſons who were killed, therefore there is nothing in his evidence relating to that.</p>
                        <p>From the next witneſs, Mr. <hi>Simpſon,</hi> you have proof of <hi>White, Wemms, Warren,</hi> and <hi>Hartegan,</hi> four of the priſoners, that they were all of the party that evening; and after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating a number of minute circumſtances, he ſwears to the diſcharge of eight guns, which if you give credit to his teſtimony, will prove to you that the whole party fired; from him you have alſo further evidence of the killing <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tcks, Gray</hi> and <hi>Caldwell.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Foſdick,</hi> depoſes that upon his going down <hi>King-ſtreet,</hi> the firſt ſalutation he had, was the preſſing of ſoldiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him with the points of their bayonets, crying out, damn your blood ſtand out of the way! this Gentlemen, was the conduct of the party as they came down along. From Mr. <hi>Foſdick</hi> alſo you have evidence of their manoeuvres
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:011683_0032_0F87C84588AF09A8"/>
both before and after they formed; when the firſt gun was fired, the ſecond man from the right puſhed his bayonet at him, and wounded him in the breaſt, you ſaw Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men the mark in Court: before this two different men pierced him in the arm and elbow quite to the bone; here Gentlemen were three thruſts given to a perſon innocently paſſing down upon the cry of fire! he knew not as he ſwears to you, what was the occaſion of the party's coming down. The right hand Grenadler fell after he had fired, occaſioned by puſhing at a perſon who went down <hi>Royal-exchange-lane,</hi> this probably was Mr. <hi>Palmes,</hi> in whoſe evidence if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, you have this circumſtance related, that on his puſhing at him the third time, <hi>Montgomery</hi>'s foot ſlipped, which gave him an opportunity to eſcape down the lane.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Hemmingway,</hi> the next witneſs, ſwears, that being in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with <hi>Killroy,</hi> he beard him ſay he never would miſs an opportunity to fire on the people of the town, for he had wanted it ever ſince be landed; that <hi>Killroy</hi> was not then in liquor nor appeared to be in anger; he told him he was a fool, for ſaying ſo, he ſaid I do not care, I will not miſs an opportunity for all that; theſe expreſſions Gentlemen ſpeak for themſelves, they are of ſuch a nature as you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but draw from them the temper of the man's heart who ſpoke them, which you will conſider at your leiſure.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Hillier,</hi> came from the <hi>North end,</hi> was told there was no fire, but the ſoldiers were inſulting the inhabitants; a number of people in <hi>Dock ſquare</hi> ſeemed afraid to go up to <hi>King-ſtreet,</hi> another circumſtance which accounts for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the inhabitants, at that time in <hi>Dock-ſquare;</hi> the witneſs went up to <hi>King-ſtreet,</hi> ſaw the Sentry with his bayo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net charged breaſt high, about twenty or thirty boys about him; he had often ſeen many more in that ſtreet in ſuch a night as that was; it was bright moon light: the people on the party's coming down ſeemed to collect in a body in <hi>Royal-exchange-lane</hi>; as he paſſed the laſt man, he heard a gun from the right, thinks it was about twenty ſeconds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſecond gun fired; be obſerved a little boy running a croſs the ſtreet crying fire, and the left hand man followed the boy with his gun; there was nothing paſſed he obſerved to induce them to apprehend any danger; he ſays, had even the ſoldiers pointed at me, I ſhould not have thought my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in danger; he thinks there were ſix guns fired; he ſaw no ſnow balls thrown, if there had been, he muſt have
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:011683_0033_0F87C84612D8DC10"/>
ſeen them. When the ſoldiers came down, there was a ſure of ſhouting, and a ſhort time after, the firſt gun fired. I need not dwell longer on this teſtimony for you muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it yourſelves.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Nicholas Ferriter</hi> was next ſworn, who knew <hi>Killroy</hi> and <hi>Warren</hi>; he ſwears to their being at the Rope-walks before this affair happened; be relates the circumſtances of three ſeveral attacks in the Rope-walks, the firſt was a ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who challenged him out to fight; a ſqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

From this affair perhaps may be dated a good deal of the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Monday-evening; you have heard from the witneſſes that the ſoldiers of that regiment, remembered the grudge, and diſcovered a malicious diſpoſition; were frequently ſeen in parties, and when ſingle, with arms, attacking the people paſſing the ſtreets. <hi>Killroy</hi> one of the priſoners, and <hi>Warren,</hi> are expreſsly ſworn to, that they were in this affray; <hi>Gray</hi> and <hi>Ferriter</hi> went into <hi>King-ſtreet, Gray</hi> had no ſtick; <hi>Ferriter</hi> left <hi>Gray</hi> in <hi>King-ſtreet</hi>; it appears he did not go down with a diſpoſition to commit any aſſault at all.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Burdick</hi> is the next witneſs, he ſays when he came down to <hi>King-ſtreet</hi> he ſpoke to a ſoldier, he thinks it was <hi>Montgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery,</hi> he aſked him if he was loaded and intended to fire; yes, by the eternal God! was the anſwer he received.— The intention of that ſoldier, whoever he was, you clearly diſcover; the witneſs thinks it was <hi>Montgomery</hi>; he ſays further, a ſoldier puſhed at him with his bayonet, and he ſtruck his gun; he ſaw nothing flung but a ſmall ſtick, which hit nobody; as he was ſtooping to take up the dead, they cocked their guns and preſented at him again; thus you ſee the ſame diſpoſition continued, they were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>iming to puſh at every body round about them; and after they had killed theſe perſons, they were not ſatisfied with that but attempted to puſh thoſe that were taking them away.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> who was next ſworn, hath nothing material in his teſtimony, but that of the guns following the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as they ran after the firſt gun was fired; that ſeven
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:011683_0033_0F87C84612D8DC10"/>
guns were fired, that he ſaw no ſticks or ſnow balls fall near them, that all the ſnow balls he did ſee ſeemed to be light, and not hard.</p>
                        <p>It has been aſked from the bench, Whether there may not be voluntary manſlaughter? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                 <desc>•</desc>

                        <p>After the witneſſes we have gone through, a number of gentlemen were examined, moſt of whom lived in <hi>Cornhill,</hi> who have teſtifyed to the conduct of the ſoldiers, that even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the affair happened.</p>
                        <p>I will not take them in order, for I apprehend, by recur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Colonel <hi>Marſhal</hi> firſt, the reſt will come in more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally; he ſays, he came from Colonel <hi>Jackſon</hi>'s in <hi>Dock-ſquare,</hi> about a quarter after nine o'clock; that the ſtreet was quite ſtill, no body paſſing thro' <hi>Dock ſquare</hi>; he came up to his own houſe next the <hi>Cuſtom houſe,</hi> he paſſed the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel, and there was no body near him; <hi>King-ſtreet</hi> was quite ſtill, fewer people paſſing than he had uſually ſeen on ſuch a fine night; he went into his own houſe, and ſoon after heard a diſtant cry of murder, what part of the ſtreet it came from he did not know: He, gentlemen, you will remember, intimated alſo this circumſtance, that he had been warned not to go out that evening; this gave him an apprehenſion there was ſome miſchief to be betwixt the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and the inhabitants; he mentioned it to the perſon in the ſtrop, and went out; looking towards the <hi>Guard-houſe,</hi> he ſaw a number of ſoldiers iſſue from thence in an undreſs, with naked ſwords, cutlaſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> crying out "Damn them where are they? By Jeſus let 'em come." As to the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Moon, whether ſhe was north or ſouth, which has been much altercated, I cannot ſee it will make much one way or the other, it is ſufficient that Colonel <hi>Marſhall,</hi>
                           <pb n="66" facs="unknown:011683_0034_0F87C846A20E23C0"/>
whoſe credibility and capacity will not be diſputed, has ſworn that from his door he obſerved a party of ſoldiers come down in undreſs, armed with cutlaſſes and other wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, the cutlaſſes he ſwears he particularly ſaw glittering in the Moon light; the expreſſions he ſaid he plainly heard, while they were brandiſhing their ſwords; when this party paſſed off, he ſaw a ſecond party come up <hi>Quaker-lane,</hi> arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſame manner, and making uſe of the ſame kind of language, and that party he ſaid cried fire; in his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony on the trial of Captain <hi>Preſton,</hi> he ſaid the bells rung on that cry; he expreſſed ſome doubt of this yeſterday, but it was certainly juſt about that time; the uſe I would make of this is, to compare it with what the other witneſſes ſay of the conduct of the ſoldiers in <hi>Cornhill</hi>; as Mr. <hi>Thayer</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it, it is probable the word fire was a watch-word; it appears to me, that if we can believe the evidence, they had a deſign of attacking and ſlaughtering the inhabitants that night, and they could have deviſed no better method to draw out the inhabitants unarmed, than to cry fire!</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Thayer,</hi> was ſitting at his fire, in <hi>Corn-hill,</hi> near <hi>Boylſton</hi>'s <hi>alley,</hi> he heard a great noiſe, and went to the door, he ſaw ſeven ſoldiers in an undreſs coming down like wild creatures, with cutlaſſes in their hands, crying damn them, where are they? upon this he heard a cry of fire, and ſuppoſed it to be a watch-word.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Kneeland,</hi> who lives by the town-pump, came out and ſtood at his door; ſaw a number of ſoldiers paſs by him armed; one of them came up to him and ſaid, damn you what do you do here? and pointed his bayonet to his breaſt, telling him to go in.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Appleton</hi> who lived oppoſite, tells you he was ſtanding by his neighbour Mr. <hi>Marſh,</hi> they were both at the door; a number of ſoldiers came running down, armed with cutlaſſes, in an undreſs, and they ſeemed to come out of their way, (obſerving them at the door) with uplifted weapons, intending as it appeared, to ſtrike them: but they fortunately got into th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>t tryal, my brother <hi>Adams</hi> made this obſervation, that "Man is a ſocial creature, that his feelings, his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, his imaginations are contagious," I am ſure if in any inſtance it is ſo, here was food enough for ſuch paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſuch imaginations to feed upon.</p>
                        <p>But Gentlemen, as it does not immediately relate to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, all the uſe I mean to make of it is, to ſhow you that from the conduct and appearance of the ſoldiery, in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent parts of the town, the inhabitants had reaſon to be apprehenſive they were in danger of their lives; children and parents, huſbands and wives, maſters and ſervants, had reaſon to tremble one for another. This apprehenſion, together with the ringing of the bells, collected numbers of people in different quarters, as is commonly the caſe when there is any appearance of fire; and the center of the town, when there is a doubt where fire is, becomes naturally the place of rendezvouz: this accounts for the number of people that were there, and for ſome having ſticks and canes. I mention this only to take off the force of any evidence or pretence that may be made, that there was an intention of the people to aſſault, or as it has been expreſſed, ſwallow up the ſoldiers.</p>
                        <p>I have now gone through the evidence on the part of the Crown, in ſupport of the charge againſt the priſoners, I ſhall make a very few obſervations, and leave it with the priſoners and their Council to make their defence, and Mr. <hi>Paine</hi> who is on the ſide of the Crown with me, to cloſe the cauſe.</p>
                        <p>I think Gentlemen upon the whole evidence, you can, in the firſt place, have no doubt but that all the priſoners at the bar were of that party of ſoldiers, headed by Capt. <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> who went down to the <hi>Cuſtom-Houſe,</hi> on the 5th. <hi>March,</hi> the evening mentioned in the indictments; that the five perſons named in thoſe indictments were killed by ſome or other of that party, but who they were that killed thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral perſons, may not be preciſely aſcertained, except in the caſe of <hi>Killroy,</hi> againſt whom I think you have certain evidence.</p>
                        <p>It is a rule of law Gentlemen, when the fact of killing is
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:011683_0035_0F87C8475D1CBA70"/>
once proved, every circumſtance alleviating, excuſing, or juſtifying, in order to extenuate the crime muſt be proved by the priſoners, for the law preſumes the fact malicious, untill the contrary appears in evidence.</p>
                        <p>There is another rule I ſhall mention alſo, and that is, that it is imaterial, where there are a number of perſons concerned, who gave the mortal blow, all that are preſent, are in the eye of the law, principals.

                        <p>By their plea of Not Guilty, they throw the burden of proof, as to the <hi>fact</hi> of <hi>killing,</hi> upon the Crown; but, upon which being proved, the matters, they allege to <hi>juſtify, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,</hi> or <hi>extenuate,</hi> muſt be adduced by them, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by legal evidence.

This is law ſo well known and acknowledged, that I ſhall not now detain you by a reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of authorities, but only refer to Judge Foſter's Crown Law, where this point is treated with preciſion, and fixed beyond controverſy. It may not be amiſs; however, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, that as certain as the cognizance of <hi>facts</hi> is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in your juriſdiction, as certain does the law, reſulting from <hi>theſe facts, in caſes of the preſent kind,</hi> ſeem to reſide <hi>ſolely</hi> in the Court: unleſs caſes where juries, under the direction of the Court, give general verdicts, may be denominated ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions.</p>

                        <p>Before we enter upon theſe enquiries, permit me, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, to remind you of the importance of this trial, as it relates to the priſoners —It is for their lives! If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the number of perſons now on trial, joined with many other circumſtances which might be mentioned, it is by far the moſt important, this country ever ſaw.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="70" facs="unknown:011683_0036_0F87C84980F5D598"/>Remember the ties you are under to the priſoners and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to yourſelves: The eyes of all are upon you. Patience in hearing this cauſe is an eſſential requiſite; candor and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are no leſs eſſential. It is tedious and painful to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſo lengthy a trial; but remember the time which has been taken up by the Crown, in the opening. By every bond of humanity and juſtice, we claim an equal indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence: pay, it is of high importance to your country, that nothing ſhould appear on this trial to impeach our juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, or ſtain our humanity.</p>
                        <p>And here, let me remind you of a notion, which has certainly been too prevalent, and guard you againſt it's baneful influence. An opinion has been entertained by many among us, that the life of <hi>a ſoldier,</hi> was of very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle value: of much leſs value, than others of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.—The law Gentlemen, knows no ſuch diſtinction;— the life of a ſoldier is viewed by the equal eye of the law, as eſtimable, as the life of any other citizen.</p>
                        <p>I cannot any other way account, for what I mention, but by ſuppoſing, that the indigence and poverty of a ſoldier,— the toils of his life,—the ſeverity of diſcipline to which he is expoſed,—the precarious tenure by which he is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thought to hold his life, in the ſummary deciſions of a court-martial, have conſpired to propagate a ſentiment of this kind; but a little attention to the human heart, will diſſipate this notion.</p>
                        <p>The ſoldier takes his choice, like all others, of his courſe of life:—he has an equal right, with you or me, ſo to do. It is beſt we ſhould not all think alike. Habit makes all things agreeable. What at firſt was irkſome, ſoon becomes pleaſing. But does experience teach, that miſery begen in general an hatred of life. By no means; we all reluct at death;—we long for one ſhort ſpace more—we graſp, with anxions ſolicitude, even after a wretched exiſtence. GOD and Nature has implanted this love of life.—Expel therefore from your breaſts, an opinion ſo unwarrantable by any law, human or divine; let not any thing ſo injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the priſoners, who value life as much as you; let not any thing ſo repugnant to all juſtice have an influence is this trial. The reputation of the country depends much on your conduct, Gentlemen, and, may I not add, Juſtice calls aloud for candour in hearing, and impartiality in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding this cauſe, which has, perhaps, too much engroſſed
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:011683_0036_0F87C84980F5D598"/>
our affections—and, I ſpeak for one, too much excited our paſſions.</p>
                        <p>The law, by which the priſoners are to be tried, is a law of mercy—a law applying to us all—a law, judge <hi>Blackſtone</hi> will tell us
<q>founded in principles, that are perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, <hi>uniform</hi> and <hi>univerſal,</hi> always <hi>conformable</hi> to the feelings of <hi>humanity</hi> and the indelible rights of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</q>
Sec 4, 13. Cap. 3.</p>
                        <p>How ought we all, who are to bear a part in this day, to aim at a ſtrick adherence to the principles of this law—how ought we all to aim at utterly eradicating every undue bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſs of the judgment—a bias ſubverſive of all juſtice and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.</p>
                        <p>Another opinion equally foreign to truth and law has been adopted by many.</p>
                        <p>It has been thought, that no poſſible caſe could happen, in which a ſoldier could fire, without the aid of a civil magiſtrate. This is a great miſtake—a very unhappy miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take indeed!—one, I am afraid, that had it's influence, on the fatal night, which we all lament. The law, <hi>as to the preſent point,</hi> puts the citizen and ſoldier under <hi>equal</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint. What will juſtify and mitigate the action or the one, will do the ſame to the other.— Let us bear this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variable in mind, in examining the evidence. But before we proceed to this examination, let us take a tranſient view of ſome occurences, proceding and ſubſequent to the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly fifth of <hi>March.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>About ſome five or ſix years ago, it is well known, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain meaſures were adopted by the <hi>Britiſh</hi> parliament, which gave a general alarm to this continent. Meaſures were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately taken, in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> that awakened jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſy, reſentment, fortitude and vigilance.—Affairs continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed long ſtactuating. A ſentiment univerſal prevailed, that our deareſt rights were invaded. It is not our buſineſs here to enquire touching theſe delicate points. Theſe are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments, which however intereſting or important in themſelves, we muſt keep far away from us, when in a Court of law. It poiſons juſtice, when politics tinctures it's current.</p>
                        <p>I need not inform you, how the tide roſe, as we were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing towards the preſent times. The general atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion became more and more rouſed people became more a like in opinion and practice. A vaſt majority thought all
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:011683_0037_0F87C849A4B7CF90"/>
that was dear was at ſtake—ſentiments of liberty—proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty—ignominious bondage—all conſpire to encreaſe the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.—At this period, the troops land.—Let us here pauſe, and view the citizen and ſoldier.</p>
                        <p>The cauſes of grievance being thus ſpread far and wide, the inhabitants viewed the ſoldiery as called in, foreign from their prime inſtitution, to force obedience to acts, which were, in general, deemed ſubverſive of natural, as well as conſtitutional freedom. With regard to the univerſal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence of ideas of this kind, it does not fall within our preſent plan, to give you direct, poſitive evidence. It would be too foreign to the preſent iſſue, though pertinent enough, when conſidered as a clue to ſprings and motives of action, and as an additional aid to form a juſt judgement in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent enquiry. You Gentlemen who come from the body of the county, are preſumed to know theſe facts, if they are true; nay their notoriety muſt be ſuch, provided I am not miſtaken in my conjecture, that the juſtice of my obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on this matter, muſt be certainly confirmed by your own experience. I preſume not in this, or any other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact, to preſcribe to you; if theſe ſentiments are wrong, they ought to have no influence; if right, they ought certainly to have their due weight.</p>
                        <p>I ſay, Gentlemen, and appeal to you for the truth of what I ſay, that many on this continent viewed their chains as already forged, they ſaw fetters as prepared, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the ſoldiers as faſtening, and riveting for ages, the ſhackles of their bondage.

Diſcontent was ſeated on almoſt every brow. Inſtead of that hoſpitality, that the ſoldier thought himſelf intitled to, ſcorn, contempt and ſilent murmurs were his recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

                        <p>The ſoldier had his feelings, his ſentiments, and his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtick paſſions alſo.

                        <p>The law had taught him to think favourably of himſelf. Had taught him to conſider himſelf,<note n="*" place="bottom">

He had heard, that he put not off the citizen, when he entered the camp; but becauſe he was a citizen, and wiſhed to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue ſo, he made himſelf for a while a ſoldier.</p>
                        <p>How ſtinging was it to be ſtigmatized, as the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of tyranny and oppreſſion? how exaſperating to be viewed, as aiding to enthrall his country? He felt his heart glow with an ardour, which <hi>he</hi> took for a love of liberty and his country, and had formed to himſelf no deſign fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to it's privileges.

Could that ſpirit, which had braved the ſhafts of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign battle, brook the keener wounds of civil conteſt?— The arrows which now pierced him, pierced as deep, and rankled more, than thoſe of former times. Is it rational to imagine much harmony could long ſubſiſt?</p>
                        <p>We muſt take human nature as we find it, and not vainly imagine, that all things are to become new, at ſuch a criſis.</p>
                        <p>There are an order of men in every commonwealth who never reaſon, but always act from feelings. That their rights and liberties were filched away one after another, they had often been told. They had been taught, by thoſe whom they believed, that the ax was now laid to the root of the tree, and one more ſtroke compleated it's fall. It was in vain to expect to ſilence or ſubdue theſe emotions by reaſons, ſoothings, or dangers. A belief, that nothing
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:011683_0038_0F87C84AAF7D5170"/>
could be worſe than the calamities which ſeemed inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, had extended itſelf on all ſides, and arguments drawn from ſuch ſources had little influence. Each day gave riſe to now occurrences which encreaſed animoſities. Heart-burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, heats and bickerings became more and more extenſive. Reciprocal inſults lowered the temper, mutual injuries im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bittered the paſſions.</p>
                        <p>Can we wonder, that when every thing tended to ſome important action, the period ſo ſoon arrived? Will not our wonder be encreaſed, to find the criſis no ſooner taking place, when ſo many circumſtances united to haſten it's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach? To uſe an alluſion ſomewhat homely, may we not wonder, that the <hi>acid</hi> and the <hi>alcali,</hi> did not ſooner fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
                        <p>A thought here imperceptibly forces itſelf on our minds, and we are led to be aſtoniſhed, that perſons ſo diſcordant in opinion, ſo oppoſite in views, attachments and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections, ſhould be ſtationed together. But here, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <hi>we muſt ſtop.</hi> If we purſue this enquiry, at this time, and in this place, we ſhall be in danger of doing great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice. We ſhall get beyond our limits. The right of quartering troops in this province muſt be diſcuſſed at a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent tribunal. The <hi>conſtitutional</hi> legality, the propriety, the expediency of their appointment are queſtions of ſtate, not to be determined, nor even agitated by us, in this Court. It is enough for us, if the law takes notice of them when thus ſtationed; if it warrants their continuance; If it protects them in their quarters. They were ſent here by that authority, which our laws know; they were quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here, as I take it, agreeable to an act of the Britiſh Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; they were ordered here, by your Sovereign, and mine. I expect hereafter, to be more particular on this head.</p>
                        <p>Let me here take a method very common, with another order of men. Let me remind you of what is <hi>not</hi> your duty.</p>
                        <p>Gentlemen, great pains have been taken by different men, with very different views, to involve the character, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and reputation of the town of <hi>Boſton,</hi> in the preſent iſſue. <hi>Boſton</hi> and it's inhabitants have no more to do with this cauſe, than you or any other members of the community.

                           </q>
Thus have you the ſenſe of this great authority <hi>with us.</hi> And let me aſk all thoſe, who have thought the cauſe of their country connected with the agents of the aſſembly in <hi>King-ſtreet,</hi> whether the <hi>proceedings</hi> of that unhappy night, were <hi>hot, raſh,</hi> or <hi>diſorderly?</hi> If they were, have they not, in the opinion of this great friend of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>injured</hi> our reputation, as to <hi>wiſdom, valour,</hi> and <hi>virtue</hi>; and that too, without procuring the <hi>leaſt</hi> benefit? Who then would ſacrifice his judgment and his integrity, to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate <hi>ſuch</hi> proceedings?</p>
                        <p>To what purpoſes the ſoldiers were ſent; whether it was a ſtep warranted by ſound policy or not, we ſhall not enquire; we are to conſider the troops, not as the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for wreſting our rights, but as fellow citizens, who being to be tried by a law, extending to every individual, claim a part in it's benefits—it's privileges—it's mercy. We
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:011683_0039_0F87C84B1C5B9908"/>
muſt ſteel ourſelves againſt paſſions, which contaminate the fountain of juſtice. We ought to recollect, that our preſent deciſions will be ſcann'd, perhaps thro' all Europe. We muſt not forget, that we ourſelves will have a reflective hour—an hour, in which we ſhall view things through a different medium—when the pulſe will no longer beat with the tumults of the day—when the conſcious pang of having betrayed truth, juſtice, and integrity, ſhall bite like a ſerpent and ſting like an adder.</p>
                        <p>Conſider, Gentlemen, the danger which you, and all of us are in, of being led away by our affections and attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.—We have ſeen the blood of our fellow men flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſtreets. We have been told that this blood was <hi>wrongfully</hi> ſhed. That is now the point in iſſue. But let it be borne deep upon our minds, that the priſoners are to be condemned by the evidence <hi>here in Court</hi> produced againſt them, and by nothing elſe. Matters heard or ſeen abroad, are to have no weight: in general they undermine the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of juſtice and truth. It has been our misfortune, that a ſyſtem of evidence has appeared in the world againſt us. It is not our buſineſs to blame any one for this. It is our misfortune, I ſay. It ſhould be remembered, that we were not preſent to croſs examine: and the danger which reſults from having this publication in the hands of thoſe who are to paſs upon our lives, ought to be guarded againſt. We ſay we are innocent, by our plea, and are not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced guilty upon a new ſpecies of evidence, unknown in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſyſtem of criminal law.</p>
                        <p>But as though a ſeries of <hi>ex parte</hi> evidence was not enough, all the colours of the canvaſs have been touched in order to freſhen the wounds, and by a tranſport of imagination, we are made preſent at the ſcene of action. The prints ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in our houſes have added wings to fancy, and in the fervour of our zeal, reaſon is in hazard of being loſt. For as was elegantly expreſſed, by a learned Gentleman at the late trial, "The paſſions of man, nay his very imaginations are contagious." The pomp of funeral, the horrors of death have been ſo delineated, as to give a ſpring to our ideas, and inſpire a glow incompatible with ſound, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berative judgment. In this ſituation, every paſſion has alternately been predominant. They have each in it's turn, ſubſided, in degree, and they have ſometimes given place to deſpondence, grief and ſorrow. How careful ſhould
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:011683_0040_0F87C84E940F0A50"/>
we be, that we do not miſtake the impreſſions of gloom and melancholy, for the dictates of reaſon and truth. How careful, leſt borne away by a torrent of paſſion, we make ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck of conſcience.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps, you may be told. Gentlemen, as I remember it was ſaid, at the late trial, that paſſions were like the flux and reſtux of the ſea—the higheſt tides always producing the loweſt ebbs. But let it be noticed, that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>de, in our political ocean, has yet never turned; certainly the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent has never ſet towards the oppoſite quarter. However ſimilies may illuſtrate, they never go for proof. —Though I believe, that it will be found, that if the tide of reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has <hi>not</hi> riſen of late, it has been becauſe, it had reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſummit.—In the ſame mode of phraſeology, if ſo homely an expreſſion may be uſed; perhaps, as the ſeam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Many things yet exiſt ſufficient to keep alive the glow of indignation. I have aimed at ſecuring you againſt the catching flame. I have endeavoured to diſcharge my duty, in this reſpect:—What ſucceſs will follow thoſe endeavours, depends on you, Gentlemen.

                        <p>
                           <hi>Gentlemen of the Jury,</hi>

                        <p>I ſhall now, <hi>for argument's ſake only,</hi> take it for granted, that <hi>the fact of killing,</hi> had been proved upon all the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: you are ſenſible this is not really true; for as to this point, there are ſeveral of the priſoners upon whom this <hi>fact</hi> is not fixed. But as I ſhall hereafter take occaſion to conſider the diſtinct caſe of each priſoner, as he is affected by the evidence, I at preſent chuſe to avoid confuſion, and apply myſelf to the full ſtrength of the crown; and, upon a ſuppoſition, that <hi>all</hi> the priſoners were anſwerable for <hi>the act</hi> of <hi>any</hi> one, ſee how the priſoners are chargeable, by the evidence already offered, with the crime of <hi>Murder:</hi>—or rather endeavour to point out to you thoſe facts, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

by the evidence on the crown ſide, which will amount, in law, to a <hi>juſtification,</hi> an excuſe, or, at leaſt, an extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of their offence.—For we ſay, that give the evidence for the king it's full ſcope and force, and our offence is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, at leaſt, to Manſlaughter: in which caſe, we claim the privilege of that law, by the ſentence of which, if guilty, we muſt ſuffer the pains of death:—a privilege we can never again claim—a privilege, that by no means im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies exemption from all puniſhment: the offender becomes liable to impriſonment, for a year—incurs a forfeiture of all goods and chattels; and, till he receives the judgment of law, is to all intents a felon—ſubject to all the diſabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and other incidents of a ſelon. Without taking up time, in attending and diſcuſſing points, no way pertinent to the preſent iſſue; without a tedious recapitulation of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, with which, I take it, we have no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, than either of you, Gentlemen; I ſay paſſing over all theſe matters as foreign to <hi>this</hi> trial:—let us ſtate evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence appearing even from the crown witneſſes.</p>
                        <p>Theſe witneſſes, (whoſe teſtimony I ſhall not conſider in the order they were produced) inform you, that in the former part of the evening a number of ſoldiers ruſhed from ſome of the lanes near the <hi>Guard houſe,</hi> or as Col. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall</hi> ſuppoſes, from the <hi>Guard houſe</hi> itſelf. But ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances he relates, as to their dreſs, may render it doubtful, whether he is right in this point. Soldiers on guard have a peculiar regimental habiliment, which they never dare put off; and if I am rightly inſtructed, no ſoldiers, but thoſe on duty, are ſuffered to be at the <hi>Guard-houſe</hi> at thoſe hours. However thus much is certain, that being dreſſed in ſhort jackets or working coa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s, proves them not to be of that particular party who had mounted guard at this time.</p>
                        <p>The cry was "where are they—damn them where are they!" They brandiſh their weapons, and proceed to <hi>Corn-hill.</hi> What thoſe weapons were the witneſſes ſay differently. But it ſhould be mentioned, as we go along, that the ſoldiers of the twenty-ninth, are never allowed to wear ſwords or cutlaſſes.</p>
                        <p>As theſe ſoldiers paſs down <hi>Corn-hill,</hi> they aſſualt, abuſe and attack people. The ſoldiers in their turn are beaten. One has his wriſt broke—and the general cry ſoon after was— "they are beaten—they are drove into the barracks!"</p>
                        <p>Some part of this conduct may hereafter be accounted for,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:011683_0041_0F87C84F0F03BC18"/>
and other parts of it may ſtand in a very different light. But we are ready to admit, that their behaviour was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unjuſtifiable—for we don't look upon ourſelves as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way concerned in their conduct.—Conduct which, if ſome of the witneſſes are not miſtaken, ſeems more like that of madmen and barbarians, than like reaſonable creatures. If <hi>they</hi> acted like ſavages or ruffians, what is that to <hi>us?</hi> This evidence, therefore not applying to this caſe, we are injur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed if it has any influence to our prejudice. Being foreign to the iſſue, we humbly conceive it ought never to have been introduced;—or being introduced, it ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, in our determining the guilt or innocence of the priſoners.</p>
                        <p>☞ Mr. <hi>Joſiah Quincy</hi> then proceeded to a minute detail of the crown evidence, pointing out, as he went along, thoſe circumſtances that favoured the priſoners; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting chiefly on thoſe facts, which ſerved to refute or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validate the poſitions of the Council for the Crown; by ſhowing an aſſult and attack upon <hi>the Sentry.</hi> He then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewed thoſe parts of the evidence, which had a tendency either to prove inſult, abuſe, or aſſault and battery of <hi>the party</hi>: he pointed out the various quarters, from which all theſe, but eſpecially the aſſault and battery proceeded: and from the facts, time and circumſtances teſtified, inferred the attack to have been on various ſides at the ſame inſtant. From the noiſes, violence and rattling of the guns he drew other conſequences uſeful to his cauſe. From the inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome, and the forgetfulneſs of others; from the tumult, fright, confuſion and paſſions in the ſcene, he made ſuch deductions as might account for the contrariety and ſeeming incompatibility of the evidence.</p>
                        <p>He next very particularly ſtated the Evidence for the priſoners, as he had been inſtructed it would turn out on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination; and as he opened his evidence, he carefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked its conformity to, and connection with, many parts of that already exhibited by the Council for the King.— He then called the witneſſes, who ſwore as follow.]</p>

I turned, and came down the lane, and went home.</p>

               <p>I am the perſon that came up ſtairs and told the witneſs examined before me, that there was a diſturbance in the ſtreet. The whole I have to ſay is this.—Coming home that evening from a friends houſe in <hi>Fore-ſtreet,</hi> I called at a houſe in <hi>Union ſtreet.</hi> Turning the corner of <hi>Fore-ſtreet,</hi> I heard a noiſe which drew my attention immediately, it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to come from the <hi>Poſt-Office,</hi> or thereabouts: Immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I went to ſee what the matter was. At the bottom of <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al-exchange lane,</hi> I aſked a man that was at a diſtance what the matter was? He ſaid it was a ſquabble betwixt the inhabitants and ſoldiers; I then ſtood at the bottom of the lane, I had not ſtood long there, till I was obliged to go away, the party, engaged with the ſoldiers, having been routed as I thought, came ruſhing down towards where I ſtood. I went into Mr. <hi>Hunter</hi>'s, found ſome gentlemen there; I told them they were very q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> indeed, conſidering theſe was ſuch a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of people in the ſtreet. We went into the balcony and ſtood there, to ſee the tranſactions below; and the only thing material I can recollect, that paſſed, was this: I ſaw a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty large number of people aſſembled together, drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, I apprehended, by the noiſe of them that were firſt engaged with the ſoldiers. It was propoſed by ſeverals of them, to call out fire!—Fire was called ſeveral times, and then the bells were ſet a ringing. This drew a great concourſe of people, not knowing but it was fire.—The greateſt part had ſticks of various ſorts; they made ſeveral attempts to get up a lane leading to <hi>Murray</hi>'s barracks, but I ſuppoſe meeting with oppoſition there, they came down as if they had been purſued. After making ſeveral ſuch attempts, they aſſembled in various little knots, with vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous leaders, I ſuppoſe every party had a leader. I heard them propoſe, let us go up and attack the <hi>Main-Guard.</hi>

in and ſaid there was fire, Mr. <hi>Fleeming</hi> ſaid he would ſend his man to ſee where the fire was, and deſired us not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy, for he had heard it was only to gather people to fight the ſoldiers, or to this effect: I was uneaſy however, and came away to go home. I met a good many people with ſticks, and bags, and ſome other things. I met Mr. <hi>Fleem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>'s man coming back, and he ſaid it was no fire, but the ſoldiers and inhabitants fighting: I ſaw two engines, and the people putting their buckets and bags in people's houſes. I enquired where the fire was; I got the ſame anſwer, no fire, but the ſoldiers and inhabitants fighting. I heard ſome ſay come let us go back, others, ſaid no by God we will go and help them. I ſaw Mr. <hi>Knight</hi> ſtanding at his own door, I ſtopt but very little time, left him and came to the head of <hi>King-ſtreet.</hi> I heard ſomebody ſay damn them why do not they break the glaſs.

I run to the door, when I came there, the people were paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pretty thick, ſome with buckets, ſome with bags, and numbers with ſticks and clubs; they ſaid there was no fire, but ſome diſturbance with the ſoldiers and inhabitants; I returned into the room ſometime, but feeling uneaſy, I went to the door again, and ſaw ſeveral companies of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple paſs, ſix or eight in a company; one company conſiſting of eight or ten, had white ſticks or clubs in their hands; one of them hallowed out, damn their bloods lets go and attack the <hi>Main guard,</hi> and knock them to hell firſt.

I went about fifteen yards below, there was a man ſtanding by me, he had the butt end of a bat in his hand, and ſaid he would throw it at the Sentinel, I ſaid do not, for he will fire at whatever place it comes from. Whether he threw it or not I do not know, for I left him and went to Mr. <hi>Sherwin's</hi> door. I was ſaying it was imprudent to attack a Sentinel on his poſt, ſomebody ſaid he was diſarmed; I thought ſo too, for I ſaw the glittering of arms; I walked to the <hi>Cuſtom houſe</hi> ſteps, curioſity led me to ſee if they were ſo prudent as to faſten the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe</hi> door; I tryed the latch, and it was faſt; a fellow ſaid to one of the ſoldiers, damn you why do you turn your bayonet this way, turn it the other way. I thought I was not ſafe there, but went to my old place, and ſtood there a few minutes; I thought I heard two guns cock, immediately I heard one go off, ſoon after another, and I think four more. I think ſix in all. The people ſaid where I was ſtanding, they fired nothing but powder. I thought to go up to an acquaintance's houſe, and went in the middle of the ſtreet, and coming oppoſite to the ſoldiers, I ſaw two men lay, one on the right and one on the left, on their backs; I concluded they were dead.</p>

               <p>I live oppoſite the barrack-houſe, and was at home that evening. A little after eight I heard a noiſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance in the ſtreet, I went out to know what it was, and was told there was a difference between the towns people and ſoldiers. I ſaw ſeveral ſoldiers paſs and repaſs, ſome with bayonets, ſome with clubs and one thing and another. I ſtood at my own door; I obſerved the noiſe ſeemed to come from towards the market; I ſaw a number of people running to and fro acroſs the bottom of the ſtreet. I ſhut my door and went in about eight or ten minutes. I heard a noiſe like a ſingle perſon running thro' <hi>Boylſton</hi>'s <hi>alley</hi> with great violence; he ran as I took it towards the barrack gate, and cried out, town born turn out, town born turn out, then turned to the ſide of the lane, and ſaid town born turn out, town born turn out. I heard this repeated twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or thirty times, I believe, it was the conſtant cry. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member after coming out the ſecond time, to hear the voice of a perſon which I took to be Enſign <hi>Maul,</hi> ſay, who is this fellow, lay hold of him. I did not hear a word paſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the people that paſſed backwards and forwards, and the Sentinel at the barrack gate, nor from the Sentinel to them; this cry of town born turn out, was repeated for ſeven or eight mintes, when I heard the voice of a great many more.</p>

               <speaker>Q</speaker>
               <p>Were they ſoldiers?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I do not know, they might be ſoldiers; from the firſt of that cry it might be a quarter of an hour or more, they ſeemed to retreat and come on again, and ſtruck their ſticks very hard againſt the corner of the houſe. The collection of ſuch a number, with the noiſe of the clubs, induced me to lock my door, put out my light in the fore part of my houſe, and to go up ſtairs into the chamber fronting the barracks; when there, I obſerved four or five officers of the 29th, ſtanding on their own ſteps, and there might be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt twenty or thirty of the town's people ſurrounding the ſteps. About that time came a little man, who he was I do not know; he ſaid, why do you not keep your ſoldiers in their barracks, they ſaid they had done every thing they poſſibly could, and would do every thing in their power,
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:011683_0048_0F87C858B834AC00"/>
to keep them in their barracks, on which he ſaid, are the inhabitants to be knocked down in the ſtreet, are they to be murdered in this manner; the officers ſtill inſiſted they had done their utmoſt, and would do it, to keep the ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in their barracks; the ſame perſon then ſaid, you know the country has been uſed ill, you know the town has been uſed ill, we did not ſend for you, we will not have you here, we will get rid of you, or we will drive you away; which of the laſt expreſſions I cannot ſay, but it was one or the other: the officers ſtill inſiſted they had done their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, and would do it, to keep the ſoldiers in their barracks, and begged the perſon to uſe his intereſt to diſperſe the people, that no miſchief might happen; whether he did addreſs the people or not, I cannot ſay, for the confuſion was ſo great I could not diſtinguiſh.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>He was a little man, I think in a ſurtout; immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately the cry of home, home, was mentioned; I dont re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect ſeeing any perſon go away at the firſt cry, and there was ſuch confuſion I could not tell what was ſaid, but in five minutes afterwards the cry home, home, was repeated, on which the greateſt part of them, poſſibly two thirds, went up <hi>Boylſton</hi>'s <hi>alley</hi> towards the <hi>Town-houſe,</hi> huzzaing for the <hi>Main Guard,</hi>

               <p>What number were there?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>A conſiderable number. I then obſerved more of the towns people come from towards the <hi>Market</hi>; there was a good deal of ſquabble and noiſe betwixt the people and the officers, but what was ſaid I could not bear. The next thing I recollect in the affair was, a little boy came down the alley, clapping his hand to his head, and cried he was killed, he was killed; on which one of the officers took hold of him, and damned him for a little raſcal, aſking him what buſineſs he had out of doors; the boy ſeemed to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſeven or eight year old. Some little time after that, I ſaw a ſoldier come out of the barrack gate with his muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, he went directly facing the alley, in the middle of the ſtreet, and kneeled down on one knee, and ſaid now damn your bloods, I will make a lane through you all; while he was preſenting, Mr. <hi>Maul</hi> an Enſign, with either Mr. <hi>Dixon</hi> or Mr. <hi>Minchin,</hi> I do not know which, came after him, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately laid hold of him, and took the muſket from him, ſhoved him towards the barrack, and I think gave him the
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:011683_0048_0F87C858B834AC00"/>
muſket again, and charged him at his peril to come out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. I do not recollect any diſcourſe that paſſed between the towns people and officers, there was ſtill ſuch clamour and confuſion, that I could not hear what paſſed; but in a little time either the ſoldier who came out before, or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, came out again, he repeated much the ſame words as the other, he had his gun in his hand, he did not offer to kneel down, but uſed the ſame expreſſions.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p>Did he preſent his firelock?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>He was preſenting when Mr. <hi>Maul</hi> knocked him down, took his muſkuet from him, drove him into the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racks, and I think the barrack gate was then ſhut; about this time I recollect I heard Dr. <hi>Cooper</hi>'s bell ring, I heard ſome officer ſay, go and ſtop that bell from ringing, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any body went or not, I cannot ſay, but it did not ring a great while: About this time I ſaw Capt. <hi>Goldfinch</hi> of the fourteenth, on the ſteps with the officers of the twenty-ninth; there came up another little man, who he was I do not know, but in a much different manner from what the other did.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>He had on a great coat or ſurtout of a light brown, he requeſted the ſoldiers might be kept in their barracks, and that the officers would do every thing in their power to keep them there, the officers ſaid, they had, and would do ſo; and as the ſoldiers were in their barracks, begged the people might go away; this little man ſaid to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, gentlemen, you hear what the officers ſay, that the ſoldiers are all in their barracks, and you had better go home; on which the cry was, home, home, home.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Yes: on which a great many went up the alley a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and I heard the expreſſion, Let us go to the <hi>Main-Guard</hi>: Capt. <hi>Goldfinch</hi> was ſtill on the ſteps, and I heard his voice ſtill talking, and I think he deſired every perſon would go away; while he was talking, I heard the report of a muſket.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>It was not many minutes; in a few ſeconds I heard the report of a ſecond gun, preſently after that a third; upon the firing of the firſt gun, I heard Capt. <hi>Goldfinch</hi> ſay, I thought it would come to this, it is time for me to go.— I then ſaw a ſoldier come down the alley from <hi>Cornhill,</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="unknown:011683_0049_0F87C85A9BFB7F78"/>
and went up to the ſteps where the officers ſtood, and ſaid, they fired from or upon the <hi>Main guard.</hi> I then heard the drum at the <hi>Main-Guard</hi> beat to arms, I came down ſtairs and did not go out till I was ſent for to ſome of the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed people.</p>

               <p>Yes, about two hours before his death, I aſked him concerning the affair, he went he ſaid up the lane, and juſt as he got to the corner, he heard a gun, he did not retreat back, but went to the <hi>Town-Houſe,</hi> as he was going along, he was ſhot: It ſeems ſtrange by the direction of the ball, how he could be killed by the firing at the <hi>Cuſtom-Houſe</hi>; it wounded a portion of the liver, ſtomach and inteſtines, and lodged betwixt the lower ribs, where I cut it out, the ball muſt have ſtruck ſome wall or ſomething elſe, before it ſtruck him.</p>

               <p>No by no means, I think one of them had a fire-ſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, as ſoon as the ſoldiers knew me, they with my perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion went to the bottom of the paſſage, when I got there,
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:011683_0049_0F87C85A9BFB7F78"/>
I ſaw ſome officers of the twenty-ninth, I told thoſe officers I ſuſpected there would be a riot, and as I was the oldeſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer I ordered the men to the barracks, and they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately confined; the mob followed me and came to the gate of the barracks, and abuſed the men very much indeed, with bad language, ſo that the men muſt have been enraged very much, but by the vigilence and activity of the officers, the men were kept within bounds; the mob ſtill inſulted the men, dared them to come out, called them a pack of ſcoundrels, that dared not come out to fight them, and it was with difficulty they were kept in their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racks, I never heard ſuch abuſe in my life, from one man to another. A little man came up and ſpoke to the people, and deſired them to go home, as they ſaw the officers uſed their beſt endeavours to keep the men in their barracks; immediately the beſt part made towards the paſſage to <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill,</hi> I ſuppoſe a body of about forty or fifty people. I thought it neceſſary to ſtay ſome time to aſſiſt the officers in keeping the men in their barracks, in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after the people had moved off, I heard ſome guns fire, and the <hi>Main-Guard</hi> drum beat to arms; I told Mr. <hi>Dixon</hi> it was neceſſary for me to move off, to join my own regiment. The ſame evening, about half an hour before this affair happened, I was in <hi>King-ſtreet,</hi> and was accoſted by a barber's boy, who ſaid, there goes the fellow who hath not paid my maſter for dreſſing his hair, fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately for me, I had his receipt in my pocket, the Sentinel ſaid, he is a gentleman, and if he owes you any thing he will pay it: I paſſed on without taking any notice of what the boy ſaid.</p>

I went to the top of the houſe but could ſee no fire; hearing by this time ſeveral bells ring, I came down and found the family at the gate; I aſked what the matter was, I was anſwered, there was a riot in <hi>King-ſtreet.</hi> I ſaw ſeveral men paſs, not in a body, but in two's and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly; they walked faſter than people generally do on buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they went up <hi>Hogg-lane</hi>; I obſerved that not a man paſſed but what had either a club, ſword, hanger, cutlaſs, or gun; as I had reaſon to believe people in a military cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter were not agreable, I went in and ordered my ſervant not to go out. I went a ſecond time to the gate, and ſaw more men paſſing by in the ſame manner as before; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after that, I heard the report of ſeveral guns. I heard the drum beat to arms, which I knew to be cuſtomary when a riot happens, but as the drum come nearer, I diſcovered a peculiarity in the beating, which made me imagine it was not a regular drum. I did not go from my lodgings that night.</p>

him where was the fire, he ſaid it was not fire; after that I went into the ſtreet, and ſaw one of my acquaintances and we run down to the end of the lane and ſaw another acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance coming up, holding his arm; I aſked him what's the matter, he ſaid the ſoldiers were fighting, had got cut laſſes, and were killing every body, and that one of them had ſtruck him on the arm, and almoſt cut it off; he told me I had beſt not go down; I ſaid a good club was better than a cutlaſs, and he had better go down and ſee if he could not cut ſome too. I went to the <hi>Town-houſe,</hi> ſaw the Sentinels pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at the <hi>Main-Guard</hi> ſtanding by Mr. <hi>Bowes</hi>'s corner; numbers of boys on the other ſide of the way were throwing ſnow balls at them; the Sentinels were enraged and ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the boys; the boys called them lobſters, bloody backs, and hallowed who buys lobſters; one of my acquaintance came and told me that the ſoldiers had been fighting, and the people had drove them to <hi>Murray</hi>'s barracks; I ſaw a number of people coming from <hi>Murray</hi>'s barracks who went down by <hi>Jackſon's</hi> corner into <hi>King-ſtreet</hi>; preſently I heard three cheers given in <hi>King-ſtreet,</hi> I ſaid we had better go down and ſee what's the matter; we went down to the Whipping-poſt and ſtood by <hi>Waldo</hi>'s ſhop, I ſaw a number of people round the Sentinel at the <hi>Cuſtom houſe,</hi> there were alſo a number of people who ſtood where I did, and were picking up pieces of ſea coal that had been thrown out thereabout, and ſnow balls, and throwing them over at the Sentinel.

               <p>Yes, I ſaw two or three of them hit, one ſtruck a Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadier on the hat, and the people who were right before them had ſticks; and as the ſoldiers were puſhing with their guns back and forth, they ſtruck their guns, and one hit a Grenadier on the fingers. At this time, the people up at the <hi>Town-houſe</hi> called again come away, come way; a ſtout man who ſtood near me, and right before the Grena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,

as they puſhed with their bayonets the length of their arms, kept ſtriking on their guns. The people ſeemed to be leaving the ſoldiers, and to turn from them, when there came down a number from <hi>Jackſon</hi>'s corner, huzzaing and crying, Damn them they dare not fire, we are not afraid of them; one of theſe people, a ſtout man with a long cord wood ſtick, threw himſelf in, and made a blow at the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer; I ſaw the officer try to ſend off the ſtroke, whether he ſtruck him or not I do not know: the ſtout man then turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed round, and ſtruck the Grenadier's gun at the <hi>Captain</hi>'s right hand, and immediately fell in with his club, and knocked his gun away, and ſtruck him over the head, the blow came either on the ſoldiers cheek or hat. This ſtout man held the bayonet with his left hand, and twitched it and cried kill the dogs, knock them over; this was the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral cry; the people then crouded in, and upon that the Grenadier gave a twitch back and relieved his gun, and he up with it and began to pay away on the people. I was then betwixt the officer and this grenadier, I turned to go off, when I had got away about the length of a gun, I turned to look towards the officer; and I heard the word fire; at the word fire I thought I heard the report of a gun, and upon my hearing the report, I ſaw the ſame grenadier ſwing his gun, and immediately he diſcharged it.</p>

               <p>No, nor any thing elſe, <hi>Samuel Gray</hi> who was ſhot that night, clapped me on the ſhoulder, and ſaid, do not run my lad, they dare not fire, and he ran back and forth among the people and clapped others alſo on the back as he did me.</p>

               <p>I think he had not; I looked to my left ſoon after the guns were fired, and ſaw him upon the ground, and with the help of ſome others, carried him to Dr. <hi>Loring</hi>'s ſhop, but could not get in, and left him there.</p>

               <p>That evening upon returning home, I ſaw a number of people round the Sentinel, making uſe of opprobious lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and threatnings, I deſired them to go off, and ſaid the conſequence would be fatal if they did not; ſome few ſnow balls were thrown, and abuſive language continued, they ſaid damn him, let him fire, he can fire but one gun.</p>

               <p>There might be from ſeventy to an hundred, I did not particularly obſerve; when I could not prevail to take them off, I went to Mr, <hi>Pain's,</hi> in a little while the party came down, I ſaw nothing afterwards; ſoon after I heard the guns fired, and Mr. <hi>Pain</hi> was wounded with one of them.</p>

               <p>I was, but was not looking that way, nor did I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve when the party came down; I told the people, the Sentinel was on duty, that was his poſt, and that he had a right to walk there, and that he could have enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him, if he ſtood in need of it, as he was ſo near the <hi>Main Guard,</hi>

               <p>He was retreating towards the ſteps with his bayonet charged. I then found the <hi>Main-guard</hi> to be in confuſion. I went up to the head of the <hi>Town-houſe,</hi> where were a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of gentlemen collected together, I aſked them what was the matter, they told me that the ſoldiers had ruſhed from <hi>Murray</hi>'s barracks, and had cut ſeveral of the inhabitants with their cutlaſſes; ſeveral people were running about the ſtreets, and the cry was God damn the raſcals. Some ſaid this will never do, the readieſt way to get rid of theſe people is to attack the <hi>Main guard,</hi> Strike at the root, there is the neſt.</p>

               <p>No, it was general, they joined in with one another as they met. I went to the north-ſide of the <hi>Town-houſe,</hi> with a view to return to the place from whence I came: I ſtopt at Mr. <hi>Kent</hi>'s door, and while I was ſtanding there, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>party of the guard came down from the <hi>Main guard</hi> a croſs <hi>King-ſtreet.</hi> I turned round and ſaw a non commiſſioned offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer (as I took him to be by his appearance) leading the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which I at firſt thought was to relieve the Sentinel at the <hi>Cuſtom-Houſe</hi> as uſual, but perceiving this guard was going down to ſupport the Sentinel, I thought it time to go where I came from, to tell the gentlemen what I had ſeen accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to promiſe. I proceeded down ſtreet on the <hi>Cuſtom houſe</hi> ſide, on the flat ſtones; the ſoldiers were drawn up in two ranks front and rear, as I thought it, they had not had time to form as I came down; I walked betwixt the two ranks, they were then loading their pieces.</p>

               <p>No. Paſſing betwixt the ranks, their guns being on a loading poſition, I paſſed leiſurly through, and they put their guns and bayonets up to let me go through. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the Bunch of Grapes from whence I came, I ſaw Mr. <hi>Davis</hi> and the other gentlemen on the ſteps, Mr. <hi>Davis</hi> aſked me to give an account of this matter, I told him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>As I ſtood on the ſteps of the Bunch of Grapes tavern, the general noiſe and cry was why do you not fire, damn you, you dare not fire, fire and be damned. Theſe words were ſpoke very loud, they might be heard to the <hi>Long wharff.</hi> The noiſe was very great indeed. There was about fifty before the ſoldiers, and about half the number before the Sentinel, before the party joined him.</p>

I do not know what he ſaid, but one of the neighbours was in the houſe and coaxed the ſword out of his hand, and he went out without it. He Said on his death bed, he ſaw a parcel of boys and negroes throwing ſnow balls at the guard. He thought the firſt or ſecond man from the Sentinel box was the man that ſhot him.</p>

               <p>I was, in company with others. I was called that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening about eleven o'clock to him, I was engaged with Mr. <hi>Paine</hi> and could not go; next morning I went; after dreſſing his wounds, I adviſed him never to go again into quarrels and riots; He ſaid he was very ſorry he did go.— Dr. <hi>Lloyd</hi> who was preſent, turned round to me and ſaid, <hi>Jeffries,</hi> I believe this man will be able to tell us how the affair was, we had better aſk him: I aſked him then how long he had been in <hi>King-ſtreet</hi> when they fired? He ſaid he went from Mr. <hi>Field</hi>'s when the bells rung, when he got to <hi>Walker</hi>'s corner, he ſaw many perſons coming from <hi>Cornhill,</hi> who he was told had been quarreling with the ſoldiers down there, that he went with them as far as the ſtocks, that he ſtopped there, but they paſſed on: While he was ſtanding there he ſaw many things thrown at the Sentry. I aſked him if he knew what was thrown? He ſaid he heard the things ſtrike againſt the guns, and they ſounded hard, he believed they were oyſter ſhells and ice; he heard the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple huzza every time they heard any thing ſtrike that ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hard: that he then ſaw ſome ſoldiers going down to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe,</hi> that he ſaw the people pelt them as they went along, after they had got down there, the croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over towards <hi>Warden</hi> and <hi>Vernon</hi>'s ſhop, in order to ſet what they would do, that as he was paſſing he was ſhot,— that he was taken up and carried home to Mr. <hi>Field</hi>'s by ſome of his friends. I aſked him whether he thought the ſoldiers would fire? He told me he thought the ſoldiers would have fired long before. I then aſked him whether he thought the ſoldiers were abuſed a great deal, after they went down there? He ſaid, he thought they were. I aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him whether he thought the ſoldiers would have been

hurt, if they had not fired? He ſaid, he really thought they would, for he heard many voices cry out, kill them. I aſked him then, meaning to cloſe all, whether he thought they fired in ſelf defence, or on purpoſe to deſtroy the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? He ſaid, he really thought they did fire to defend themſelves; that he did not blame the man whoever he was, that ſhot him. This converſation was on <hi>Wedneſday.</hi> He always gave the ſame anſwers to the ſame queſtions, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very time I viſited him.</p>

               <p>On the evening of the 5th of <hi>March</hi> I left my houſe in <hi>Winter ſtreet,</hi> and went to ſee a friend in the neighbourhood of Dr. <hi>Cooper</hi>'s meeting.

                        <p>I ſtated to you, Gentlemen, your duty, in opening this muſe—do not forget the diſcharge of it.

                        <p>I ſay, Gentlemen, by the ſtandard of the law are <hi>we</hi> to judge the actions of the people who were the aſſailants, and thoſe who were the aſſailed, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>hen on duty. And here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gentlemen, the rule, we formerly laid down, takes place. To the <hi>facts,</hi> Gentlemen, apply yourſelves. Conſider them as teſtified: weigh the credibility of the witneſſes— balance their teſtimony—compare the ſeveral parts of it— ſee the amount of it:—and then according to your oaths —"Make <hi>true</hi> deliverance according to your <hi>evidence.</hi>" That is Gentlemen, having ſettled the facts—bring them truely to the ſtandard of the law; the king's judges who are acquainted with it, who are preſumed beſt to know it, will then inſpect this great ſtandard of right and wrong, truth and juſtice; and they are to determine the degree of guilt to which <hi>the fact</hi> riſes.</p>
                        <p>But before we come to thoſe diviſions of enquiry, under which I intend to conſider the evidence, let me once more carefully diſtinguiſh between the tranſactions in <hi>Cornhill</hi> and thoſe by the <hi>Cuſtom Houſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The conduct of the ſoldiers in <hi>Cornhill</hi> may well be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have exaſperated the minds of all who beheld their behaviour. Their actions accumulated guilt as it flew —at leaſt, we may well ſuppoſe, the incenſed people who related them, added new colours to the ſcene. The flame of reſentment imperceptibly enkindles, and a common ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance

with human nature will ſhew, that it is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant ſuppoſition, to imagine many a moderate man might at ſuch a ſeaſon, with ſuch ſentiments, which I have more than once noticed;—hearing ſuch relations and complaints; I ſay do I injure any one, in ſuppoſing, that under all theſe circumſtances, a very moderate perſon, who in ordinary matters acted with ſingular diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, ſhould now be drawn imperceptibly away, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tranſported into meaſures, which in a future moment he would condemn and lament. What more natural ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, than to ſuppoſe many an honeſt mind might at this time fluctuate thus.—The ſoldiers are here—we wiſh them away: we did not ſend for them—they have cut and wounded the peaceable inhabitants, and it may be my turn next. At this inſtant of time, he has a freſh detail of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries—reſentment redoubles every ſucceſſive moment—huz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za! for the <hi>Main-guard</hi>: we are in a moment before the <hi>Cuſtom-Houſe.</hi> No time is given for recollection. We find, from the king's evidence, and from our own, the cry was "Here is a ſoldier!" Not here is <hi>the ſoldier</hi> who has injured us—here is the fellow who wounded the man in <hi>Cornihll.</hi> No, the reaſoning or rather ferment ſeems to be, the ſoldiers have committed an outrage, we have an equal right to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict puniſhment—or rather revenge, which they had to make an aſſault.—They ſaid right, but never conſidered, that, <hi>thoſe</hi> ſoldiers had <hi>no right</hi> at all. Theſe are ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments natural enough to perſons in this ſtate of mind—we can eaſily ſuppoſe even good men thinking and acting thus. Very ſimilar to this is the force of Dr. <hi>Hirons</hi>'s teſtimony, and ſome others. But our enquiry is—What ſays the law? We muſt calmly enquire, whether this, or any thing like it, is countenanced by the law. What is <hi>natural</hi> to <hi>the man,</hi> what are his feelings are one thing: what is the <hi>duty</hi> of the <hi>citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen</hi> is quite another. Reaſon muſt reſume her ſeat—and then we ſhall hear, and obey the voice of the law.</p>
                        <p>The law indulges no man in being his own avenger.— Early, in the hiſtory of juriſprudence, we find the ſword taken from the party injured, and put into the hands of the magiſtrate. Were not this the caſe, puniſhment would know no bounds in extent or duration. Beſides, it ſaps the very root of diſtributive juſtice, when any individual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades the prerogative of law, and ſnatches from the civil magiſtrate the balance and the rod. How much more are the
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:011683_0070_0F87C7F0BA720D28"/>
pillars of ſecurity ſhaken, when a mixt body, aſſembled as thoſe in <hi>King-ſtreet,</hi> aſſume the province of juſtice, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the rights of the citizen? For it muſt not be forgot, that the ſoldier is a citizen, equally intitled with us all to protection and ſecurity. Hence all are alike obliged to pay obedience to the law: For the price of this protection is that of obedience.</p>
                        <p>Let it not be apprehended, that I am advancing a doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, that a ſoldier may attack an inhabitant, and he not allowed to defend himſelf. No Gentlemen! if a ſoldier ruſh violently through the ſtreet and preſents a weapon of death, in a ſtriking poſture; no doubt the perſon aſſailed may defend himſelf, even to taking the life of the aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant. Revenge and a ſenſe of ſelf preſervation inſtantly take poſſeſſion of the perſon thus attacked; and the law goes not upon the abſurd ſuppoſition, that a perſon can in theſe circumſtances, unman himſelf. Hence we find a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, taking his wife in the act of adultery, inſtantly ſeizes a deadly weapon and ſlays the adulterer;—it is not murder. Nay a fillip upon the noſe or forehead, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, is ſuppoſed by the law to be ſufficient provocation to reduce killing to Manſlaughter. It is, therefore, upon prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples like theſe, principles, upon which thoſe, who now bear the hardeſt againſt us, at other times, ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend; it is, I ſay, upon the right of ſelf-defence and ſelf-preſervation we rely for our acquittal.</p>
                        <p>Here again it ſhould be kept in view, that whenever the party injurying has eſcaped by flight, and time ſufficient for the paſſions to cool, in judgment of law, hath elapſed; however great the injury, the injured party muſt have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to law for his redreſs. Such is the wiſdom of the law; of that law, than which we are none of us to preſume ourſelves wiſer;—of that law, which is ſonned in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of ages, and which in condeſcenſion to the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of fleſh and blood (but to nothing elſe) extenuates the offence. For
<q>no man, ſays the learned Judge <hi>Foſter, under the protection of the law</hi> is to be the <hi>avenger</hi> of his own wrongs. If they are of ſuch a nature for which the laws of ſociety will give him an andequate remedy, <hi>thither</hi> he ought to reſort. But be they <hi>of what nature ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,</hi> he <hi>ought</hi> to bear his lot <hi>with patience,</hi> and remember, <hi>that vengeance belongeth to the Moſt High.</hi>

            <p>[☞ Mr. <hi>Quincy</hi> now entered, at large, upon a review of the appearances in ſeveral parts of the town: he was copious upon the expreſſions and behaviour ſworn to.</p>
            <p>He, then, more particularly recapitulated the evidence touching <hi>Murray</hi>'s <hi>Barracks, Dock-ſquare,</hi> and the <hi>Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He next purſued ſeveral parties, through the ſeveral lanes and ſtreets, till they centered at the ſcene of action.</p>
            <p>The teſtimonies of the witneſſes, who ſwore to the repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed information given the people;—that the Sentry and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were on duty;—that they were deſired to withdraw and warned of the conſequences;—were in their order conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Under the next three heads, was remarked "the temper of the <hi>Sentry,</hi> of the <hi>party of ſoldiers,</hi> and of the <hi>people ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.</hi>"</p>
            <p>The <hi>words, inſult</hi> and <hi>geſtures</hi> of the ſame perſons were next pointed out: and from thence was collected the deſigns of the perſons <hi>aſſaulting,</hi> and the reaſonable apprehenſions of thoſe <hi>aſſaulted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Quincy</hi> then came to the <hi>attack</hi> itſelf;—conſidering who the perſons were (namely <hi>ſome</hi> ſailors;) remarking mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutely the words and actions immediately preceeding the onſet; the weapons uſed; the violence of the aſſualt and battery; and the danger of the ſoldiers.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Quincy</hi> next exhibited thoſe parts of the teſtimonies, which evidenced the attack continued <hi>after the firing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Under all theſe heads, there was methodically ſtated the number of the witneſſes to each point, and by a compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive view of all the proofs, concluſions drawn as to the force of the whole.</p>
            <p>The next conſideration, in this mode of enquiry, was the evdience as ſeverally pertaining to <hi>each</hi> priſoner; with

            <p>And particularly with regard to <hi>Kellroy,</hi> Mr. <hi>Quincy</hi> cited and commented on the following paſſages from judge <hi>Foſter</hi>'s Crown law, and the Marquiſs of <hi>Beccaria</hi>'s Eſſay on Crimes and puniſhments.</p>
            <p>"WORDS are often miſrepreſented, whether through ignorance, inattention, or malice, it mattereth not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, he is equally effected in either caſe; and they are extremely liable to miſconſtruction. And withall, this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is not in the ordinary courſe of things to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by that ſort of negative evidence by which the proof of plain facts may be and often is confronted." Crown Law, 243.</p>
            <p>"Finally, the CREDIBILITY of a witneſſes is NULL, when the queſtion relates to the WORDS of a <hi>criminal</hi>; for the tone of voice, the geſture, all that preceds, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies and follows the different ideas which men annex to the ſame words, may ſo alter and modify a man's diſcourſe, that it is almoſt impoſſible to repeat them preciſely in the manner in which they were ſpoken. Beſides, violent and uncommon actions, ſuch as real crimes, leave a trace in the multitude of circumſtances that attend them, and in their effects; but <hi>Words</hi> remain only in the memory of the hearers, who are commonly negligent or prejudiced. It is infimitely eaſier then to found an accuſation on the <hi>Words,</hi> than on the <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of a man; for in theſe, the number of circumſtances, urged againſt the accuſed, afford him variety of means of <hi>juſtifications.</hi>"] Eſſay 48, 9.</p>

                        <p>And here, Gentlemen, let me again inform you, that the law which is to paſs upon theſe priſoners, is a law adapting itſelf to the human ſpeices, with all their feelings, paſſions and infirmities; a law which does not go upon the abſurd ſuppoſition, that men are ſtocks and ſtones; or that in the fervour of the blood, a man can act with the diliberation and judgment of a philoſopher.

It, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in ſome degree conforms itſelf to all the workings of the paſſions, to which it pays a great indulgence, ſo far as not to be wholly incompatible, with the wiſdom, good order and the very being of government.</p>
                        <p>Keeping therefore this full in view, let us take once more, a very brief and curſory ſurvey of matters ſupported by the evidence. And, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>, let me aſk ſober reaſon—What langu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age more approbrious—What actions more exaſperating, than thoſe uſed, on this occaſion? Words, I am ſenſible are no <hi>juſtification</hi> of blows, but they ſerve as the grand clues to diſcover the temper and the deſigns of the agents: they ſerve alſo to give us light in diſcerning the apprehenſions and thoughts of thoſe who are the objects of abuſe.</p>
                        <p>"You lobſter," "You bloody-back," "You coward" and "You daſtard," are but ſome of the expreſſions proved.— What words more galling? What more cutting and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking to a ſoldier? To be reminded of the colour of his garb, by which he was diſtinguiſhed from the reſt of his fellow citizens; to be compared to the moſt deſpicable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal, that crawls upon the earth, was touching indeed a tender point, To be ſtigmatized with having ſmarted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the laſh, at the halbert, to be twited with ſo infamous an ignominy; which was either wholly undeſerved, or a grievance which ſhould never have been repeated:—I ſay to call up and awaken ſenſations of this kind, muſt ſting e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to madneſs. But accouple theſe words with the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding actions,—"You daſtard,"—"You coward!"—A ſoldier and a coward! This was touching, (with a witneſs) "<hi>The point of honour,</hi> and the pride of virtue."—But while theſe are as yet fomenting the paſſions, and ſwelling the boſom, the attack is made: and probably the latter words were reitterated at the onſet; at leſt, were yet ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ear. Gentlemen of the jury, for heaven's ſake, let us put ourſelves in the ſame ſituation!

                        <p>But does the ſoldier ſtep out of his ranks to ſeek his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge?

Theſe were words likely to produce reflection and procure peace. But had the words on the other hand a ſimilar tendency?— Conſider the temper prevalent among all parties at this time.

And they moſt certainly are <hi>not</hi> to be tried by the <hi>Moſaic</hi> law: a law, we take it, peculiarly deſigned for the government of a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar nation, who being in a great meaſure under a theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical form of government, it's inſtitutions cannot, with any propriety, be adduced for our regulation in theſe days. It is with pain, therefore, I have obſerved any endeavour to miſlead our judgment on this occaſion; by drawing our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:011683_0072_0F87C7F1E653CC50"/>
to the precepts delivered in the days of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and by diſconnected paſſages of Scriptures, applied in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner foreign to their original deſign or import, there ſeems to have been an attempt to touch ſome peculiar ſentiments, which we know are thought to be prevalent; and in this way, we take it, an injury is like to be done, by giving the mind a biaſs, it ought never to have received; becauſe it is not warranted by our laws.</p>
                        <p>We have heard it publicly ſaid of late, oftener, than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
<q>Whoſoever ſhedeth man's blood, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed.</q>
This is plainly, Gentlemen, a general rule, which, like all others of the kind muſt have its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions. A rule, which if taken in it's ſtrict litteral lattitude, would imply, that a man killing another in ſelf defence, would incur the pains of death. A doctrine, which no man in his ſenſes would ever embrace: a doctrine that certainly never prevailed under the <hi>Moſaical</hi> inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For we find, the <hi>Jews</hi> had their ſix cities of refuge, to which the manſlayer might flee, from the avenger of blood. And ſomething analogous to this, (if it did not originate from it) is our benefit of clergy.</p>
                        <p>And ſo, that "the <hi>murderer</hi> ſhall flee to the pit" comes under the ſame conſideration. And when we hear it aſked, as it very lately has been, "Who DARE ſtay him?" I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, if the laws of our country ſtay him, you ought to do likewiſe; and every good ſubject <hi>dares</hi> to do what the law allows. But the very poſition is <hi>begging the queſtion:</hi> for the queſtion, now in iſſue, is, whether either of the priſoners is <hi>a murderer,</hi> in the ſenſe of our laws; for you recollect, that what is murder and what not, is <hi>a queſtion of law,</hi> ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon facts ſtated and allowed.</p>
                        <p>But to go on;
<q>You ſhall take no ſatisfaction for the life of a <hi>murderer,</hi> which is <hi>guilty of death.</hi>
                           </q>
Here again, is a begging the queſtion; and moreover the words "<hi>guilty of death,</hi>" if rightly rendered from the original, muſt be one of thoſe general rules, I juſt now mentioned; which always have their exceptions. But thoſe words ſeem to be wrong tranſlated; for in the margin of our great bible, we find them rendered "<hi>faulty to die.</hi>" Againſt a poſition of this kind we have no objection. If we have committed <hi>a fault,</hi> on which <hi>our laws</hi> inflict the puniſhment of <hi>death,</hi> we muſt ſuffer. But what fault we have committed you are to enquire: or rather you, Gentlemen, are to find the
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:011683_0073_0F87C7F2D6D33360"/>
                           <hi>facts proved in Court againſt us,</hi> and the Judges are to ſee and conſider what the law pronounces touching our offence, and what puniſhment is thereby inflicted as a penalty.</p>
                        <p>In order to come at the whole law reſulting from the facts which have been proved, we muſt enquire into the LEGALITY of the <hi>aſſemblies.</hi> For ſuch is the wiſdom and policy of the law, that if any aſſembly be <hi>lawful,</hi> each in dividual of that aſſembly is anſwerable <hi>only for his own<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The law laid down, in <hi>Foſter,</hi> 261, 2. before cited, being indiſputable law, not denied or controverted; and being very material in the trial, and much relied on by the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, is here ſet down at large.</p>
            <p>"I will mention a caſe, (ſays the learned Judge,) which through the ignorance or leuity of juries hath been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times brought within the rule of accidental death. It is where a blow aimed at <hi>one</hi> perſon lighteth upon <hi>another</hi> and killeth him. This, in a looſe way of ſpeaking, may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led accidental <hi>with regard to the perſon who dieth by a blow not intended againſt</hi> HIM. But the law conſidereth this caſe in a quite different light. If from circumſtances it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the injury intended to A. be it by poiſon, blow, or ANY OTHER MEANS OF DEATH, would have amounted to murder, ſuppoſing <hi>him</hi> to have been killed by it, it will amount to the ſame offence if B. happeneth to fall by the ſame means. Our books ſay, that in this caſe the malice <hi>egreditur perſonam</hi> But to ſpeak more intelligibly, where the injury intended againſt A. proceeded from a wicked, murderons, or miſchievous motive, the party is anſwerable for all the conſequences of the action, if death enſues, from

it, though it had not its effect upon the perſon whom he intended to deſtroy. The <hi>malitia</hi> I have already explained, the heart regardleſs of ſocial duty DELIBERATELY bent upon miſchief, conſequently the guilt of the party is juſt the ſame in the one caſe as the other. <hi>On the other hand,</hi> if the blow intended againſt A. and lighting on B. <hi>aroſe from a ſudden traſport of paſſion</hi> which in caſe A. had died by it, <hi>would have been reduced to manſlaughter,</hi> the fact will admit of the SAME ALLEVIATION if B. ſhould happen to fall by it." To the ſame effect are other authorities.</p>

                        <p>I have now gone thro' thoſe authorities in law, which I thought pertinent to this trial. I have been thus lengthy, not for the information of the Court, but to ſatisfy you, Gentlemen, and all who may chance to hear me, of that law, which is well known to thoſe of us, who are conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ts, but not ſo generally known, or attended to, by many, as <hi>it ought to be.</hi> A law which extends to each of us, as well as to any of the priſoners; for it knows <hi>no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of perſons.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And the doctrines which have been thus laid down are for the ſafeguard of us all. Doctrines which are founded in the wiſdom and policy of ages; which the greateſt men, whoever lived, have adopted and contended for. Nay, the matter has been carried, by very wiſe men, much further than we have conteſted for. And that you may not think the purport of the authorities read, are the rigid notions of a dry ſyſtem, and the contracted deciſions of municipal law, I beg leave to read to you a paſſage from a very great, theortic, writer: a man whoſe praiſes have reſounded through all the known world, and probably will, through all ages, whoſe ſentiments are as free air, and who has done as much for learning, liberty, and mankind, as any of the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi>; I mean the ſagacious Mr. <hi>Locke</hi>: He will tell you, Gentlemen, in his Eſſay on Government, p. 2. c. 3. "That <hi>all manner of force without right</hi> puts man in a ſtate of <hi>war</hi> with the <hi>aggreſſor</hi>; and of conſequence, that, being in ſuch a ſtate of <hi>war,</hi> he may LAWFULLY KILL him, who put him under this <hi>unnatural</hi> reſtraint." According to this doctrine, we ſhould have nothing to do, but enquire, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther here was "<hi>force without right</hi>:" if ſo, we were <hi>in ſuch a ſtate,</hi> as rendered it LAWFUL TO KILL the aggreſſor, who
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:011683_0074_0F87C7F35CE0CAB0"/>
                           <q>put us under ſo <hi>unnatural</hi> a <hi>reſtraint.</hi> Few, I believe, will ſay, after hearing <hi>all</hi> this evidence, that we were under no <hi>unnatural reſtraint.</hi>
                           </q>
But we don't want to extend matters ſo far. We cite this author to ſhow the world, that the greateſt friends to their country, to univerſal liberty, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable rights of all men, have held tenets, and advanced maxims favourable to the priſoners at the bar. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we ſhould not adopt the ſentiments of Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> in their moſt extenſive latitude, yet there ſeems to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing very analogous to his opinion, which is countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in our laws.</p>
                        <p>There is a ſpirit which pervades the whole ſyſtem of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> juriſprudence, which inſpires a freedom of thought, ſpeech and behaviour. Under a form of government like ours, it would be in vain to expect, that pacific, timid, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequious, and ſervile temper, ſo predominant in more deſpotic governments. From our happy conſtitution there reſults it's very natural effects—an impatience of injuries, and a ſtrong reſentment of inſults: (and a very wiſe man has ſaid, "He who <hi>tamely</hi> beareth inſults <hi>inviteth</hi> injuries.") Hence, I take it, that attention to the "feelings of humanity"— to "humanity and imperfection"—"the infirmities of fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

that attention to
"the indelible rights of mankind;"—that lenity to "the paſſions of man;"— that "benignity and condeſcention of the law" ſo often repeated in our books.</p>
                        <p>And, indeed, if this were not the caſe, the genius of our civil conſtitution and the ſpirit of our municipal law would be repugnant:—that prime defect in any political ſyſtem —that grand ſoleciſm in ſtate-policy.</p>
                        <p>

As the priſoners ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you for their lives, it may be proper, to recollect with what temper the law requires we ſhould proceed to this trial. The form of proceeding at their arraignment, has diſcovered that the ſpirit of the law upon ſuch occaſſions, is
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:011683_0075_0F87C7F9F3E23230"/>
conformable to humanity, to common ſenſe and feeling; that it is all benignity and candor. And the trial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences with the prayer of the Court, expreſſed by the Clerk, to the Supream JUDGE of Judges, empires and worlds: "God ſend you a good deliverance."</p>
                        <p>We find, in the rules laid down by the greateſt Engliſh Judges, who have been the brighteſt of mankind;—We are to look upon it as more beneficial, that many guilty perſons ſhould eſcape unpuniſhed, than one innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould ſuffer. The reaſon is, becauſe it's of more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to community, that innocence ſhould be protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than it is, that guilt ſhould be puniſhed; for guilt and crimes are ſo frequent in the world, that all of them can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be puniſhed; and many times they happen in ſuch a manner, that it is not of much conſequence to the public, whether they are puniſhed or not. But when innocence it ſelf, is brought to the bar and condemned, eſpecially to die, the ſubject will exclaim, it is immaterial to me, whether I behave well or ill; for virtue itſelf, is no ſecurity. And if ſuch a ſentiment as this, ſhould take place in the mind of the ſubject, there would be an end to all ſecurity whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. I will read the words of the law itſelf.</p>
                        <p>The rules I ſhall produce to you from Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Hale,</hi> whoſe character as a lawyer, a man of learning and philoſophy, and as a chriſtian, will he diſputed by nobody living; one of the greateſt and beſt characters, the Engliſh nation ever produced: his words are theſe. 2.

C. <hi>Tutius ſemper eſt errare, in acquietando, quam in puniendo, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte miſericerdioe, quam ex parte juſtifioe,</hi> it is always ſafer to err in acquitting, than puniſhing, on the part of mercy, than the part of juſtice: The next is from the ſame au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, 305 <hi>Tutius erratur ex parte mitiori,</hi> it is always ſafer to err on the milder ſide, the ſide of mercy, H. H. P. C. 509, the beſt rule in doubtful caſes, is, rather to incline to acquital than conviction: and in page 300 <hi>Quod dubitas ne feceris,</hi> Where you are doubtful never act; that is, if you doubt of the priſoners guilt, never declare him guilty; this is always the rule, eſpecially in caſes of life. An other rule from the ſame Author, 289, where he ſays, In ſome caſes, preſumptive evidence go far to prove a perſon guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though there is no expreſs proof of the fact, to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by him; but then it muſt be very warily preſſed, for
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:011683_0076_0F87C7FA76B4A768"/>
it is better, five guilty perſons ſhould eſcape unpuniſhed, than one innocent perſon ſhould die.</p>
                        <p>The next authority ſhall be from another Judge, of equal character, conſidering the age wherein he lived; that is Chancellor <hi>Forteſcue,</hi> in praiſe of the laws of England, page 59, this is a very ancient writer on the Engliſh law: his words are, "Indeed one would rather, much rather, that twenty guilty perſons eſcape the puniſhment of death, than one innocent perſon be condemned, and ſuffer capitally." Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Hale,</hi> ſays, It is better five guilty perſons eſcape, than one innocent perſon ſuffer. Lord Chancellor <hi>Fortiſcue,</hi> you ſee, carries the matter farther, and ſays, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed one had rather, much rather, that twenty guilty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhould eſcape, than one innocent perſon ſuffer capitally. Indeed this rule is not peculiar to the Engliſh law, there never was a ſyſtem of laws in the world, in which this rule did not prevail; it prevailed in the ancient Roman law, and which is more remarkable, it prevails in the modern Roman law, even the Judges in the Courts of Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who with racks, burnings and ſcourges, examine cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals, even there, they preſerve it as a maxim, that it is better the guilty ſhould eſcape puniſhment, than the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſuffer. <hi>Satius eſſe nocentem abſolvi quam inſentem damnari,</hi> this is the temper we ought to ſet out with; and theſe the rules we are to be governed by. And I ſhall take it for granted, as a firſt principle, that the eight priſoners at the bar, had better be all acquitted, though we ſhould admit them all to be guilty, than, that any one of them ſhould by your verdict be found guilty, being innocent.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall now conſider the ſeveral diviſions of law, under which the evidence will arrange itſelf.</p>
                        <p>The action now before you, is homicide; that is the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of one man by another, the law calls it homicide, but it is not criminal in all caſes, for one man to ſlay another. Had the priſoners been on the <hi>Plains of Abraham,</hi> and ſlain an hundred <hi>Frenchmen</hi> a piece, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> law would have conſidered it, as a commendable action, virtuous and praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy: ſo that every inſtance of killing a man, is not a crime in the eye of the law; there are many other inſtances which I can not enumerate, an officer that executes a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon under ſentence of death, &amp;c. So that Gentlemen, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inſtance of one man's killing another, is not a crime,
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:011683_0076_0F87C7FA76B4A768"/>
much leſs a crime to be puniſhed with death. But to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to ſome more particulars.</p>
                        <p>The law divides homicide into three branches; the firſt, is juſtifiable, the ſecond excuſable, and the third felonious; felonious homicide, is ſubdivided into two branches; the firſt is murder, which is killing with malice aforethought, the ſecond is manſlaughter, which is killing a man on a ſudden provocation: here Gentlemen, are four ſorts of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micide, and you are to conſider, whether all the evidence amounts to the firſt, ſecond, third, or fourth, of theſe heads. The fact, was the ſlaying five unhappy perſons that night; you are to conſider, whether it was juſtifiable, excuſable, or felonious; and if felonious, whether it was murder or manſlaughter. One of theſe four it muſt be, you need not divide your attention to any more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. I ſhall however, before I come to the evidence, ſhow you ſeveral authorities, which will aſſiſt you and me in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating the evidence before us.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall begin with juſtifialbe homicide; if an officer a ſheriff execute a man on the gallows, draws and quarters him, as in caſe of high treaſon, and cuts off his head, this is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable homicide, it is his duty. So alſo, Gentlemen, the law has planted fences and barriers around every individual; it is a caſtle round every man's perſon, as well as his houſe.— As the love of God and our neighbour, comprehends the whole duty of man, ſo ſelf-love and ſocial, comprehend all the duties we owe to mankind, and the firſt branch is ſelf-love, which is not only our indiſputable right, but our cleareſt duty, by the laws of nature, this is interwoven in the heart of every individual; God almighty, whoſe laws we cannot alter, has implanted it there, and we can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilate ourſelves, as eaſily as root out this affection for ourſelves. It is the firſt, and ſtrongeſt principle in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Juſtice <hi>Blackſtone</hi> calls it, "The primary cannon in the law of nature." That precept of our holy religion which commands us to love our neighbour as ourſelves doth not command us to love our neighbour better than ourſelves, or ſo well, no Chriſtian Divine hath given this interpretation. The precept enjoins, that our benevolence to our fellow men, ſhould be as real and ſincere, as our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to ourſelves, not that it ſhould be as great in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. A man is authoriſed therefore by common ſenſe, and the laws of Egland, as well as thoſe of nature, to love
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:011683_0077_0F87C7FAE82177D0"/>
himſelf better than his fellow ſubject: If two perſons are caſt away at ſea, and get on a plank, (a caſe put by Sir Francis <hi>Bacon,</hi>) and the plank is inſufficient to hold them both, the one hath a right to puſh the other of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> to ſave himſelf. The rules of the common law therefore, which authorize a man to preſerve his own life at the expence of another's, are not contradicted by any divine or moral law. We talk of liberty and property, but, if we cut up the law of ſelf-defence, we cut up the foundation of both, and if we give up this, the reſt is of very little value, and therefore, this principle muſt be ſtrictly attended to, for whatſoever the law pronounces in the caſe of theſe eight ſoldiers will be the law, to other perſons and after ages, all the perſons that have ſlain mankind in this country, from the beginning to this day, had better have been acquitted, than that a wrong rule and precedent ſhould be eſtabliſhed.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall now, read to you a few authorities on this ſubject of ſelf-defence. Foſter 273 in the caſe of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable ſelf-defence, "The injured party may repell force with force in defence of his perſon, habitation, or property, againſt one who manifeſtly intendeth and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoureth with violence, or ſurprize, to commit a known felony upon either."—In theſe caſes, he is not obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, but may purſue his adverſary, till he findeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out of danger, and if in a conflict between them he happeneth to kill, ſuch killing is juſtifiable." Keiling, 128, 129. I muſt intreat you, to conſider the words of this authority, the injured perſon may repell force by force againſt any who endeavours to commit any kind of felony on him or his, here the rule is, I have a right to ſtand on my own defence, if you intend to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit felony; if any of the perſons made an attack on theſe ſoldiers, with an intention to rob them, if it was but to take their hats feloniouſly, they had a right to kill them on the ſpot, and had no buſineſs to retreat; if a robber meets me in the ſtreet, and commands me to ſurrender my purſe, I have a right to kill him without aſking queſtions; if a perſons commits a bare aſſault on me, this will not juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify killing, but if he aſſaults me in ſuch a manner, as to diſcover an intention, to kill me, I have a right to deſtroy him, that I may put it out of his power to kill me. In the caſe you will have to conſider, I do not know there was any attempt to ſteal from theſe perſons; however,
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:011683_0077_0F87C7FAE82177D0"/>
there were ſome perſons concerned, who would probably enough have ſtolen, if there had been any thing to ſteal; and many were there who had no ſuch diſpoſition, but this is not the point we aim at, the queſtion is, are you ſatisfied, the people made the attack in order to kill the ſoldiers? If you are ſatisfied that the people, who ever they were, made that aſſault, with a deſign to kill or maim the ſoldiers, this was ſuch an aſſault, as will juſtify the ſoldiers killing in their own defence. Further it ſeems to me, we may make ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther queſtion, whether you are ſatisfied that their real in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was to kill or maim or not? if any reaſonable man, in the ſituation of one of theſe ſoldiers, would have had reaſon to believe in the time of it, that the people came with an intention to kill him, whether you have this ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction now, or not in your own minds, they were juſtifiable, at leaſt excuſable in firing; you and I, may be ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that the people who made this aſſault on the ſoldiers, did it to put them to the flight, on purpoſe that they might go exulting about the town afterwards in triumph; but this will not do, you muſt place yourſelves in the ſituation of <hi>Wemms</hi> or <hi>Killroy</hi>—conſider yourſelves, as knowing that the prejudices of the world about you, were againſt you; that the people about you, thought you came to dragoon them into obedience to ſtatutes, inſtructions, mandates and edicts, which they thoroughly deteſted; that many of theſe people were thoughtleſs and inconſiderate, old and young, ſailors and landmen, negroes and molattos; that they, the ſoldiers had no friends about them, the reſt were in oppoſition to them; with all the bells ringing, to call the town together to aſſiſt the people in <hi>King-ſtreet</hi>; for they knew by that time, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Foſter 274.</p>
                        <p>Hawkins P. C. Chap. 28, § 25. towards the end, "Yet it ſeems that a private perſon, a <hi>fortiori,</hi> an officer of juſtice, who happens unavoidably to kill another in endeavouring to defend himſelf from, or ſuppreſs dangerous rioters, may juſtify the fact, in as much as he only does his duty in aid of the public juſtice."

And can it be more juſtifiable to fight for my goods than for my life; and it is not only highly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to reaſon that a man in ſuch circumſtances, may lawfully kill another, but it ſeems alſo to be confirmed by the general tenor of our law books, which ſpeaking of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micide <hi>ſe defendo,</hi> ſuppoſe it done in ſome quarrel or affray.."</p>
                        <p>

Hawkins p. 71. § 14.— Here every private perſon is authorized to arm himſelf, and on the ſtrength of this authority, I do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the inhabitants had a right to arm themſelves at that time, for their defence, not for offence, that diſtinction is material and muſt be attended to.</p>
                        <p>Hawkins, page 75. § 14. "And not only he who on an aſſault retreats to the wall or ſome ſuch ſtreight, beyond which he can go no further, before he kills the other, is judged by the law to act upon unavoidable neceſſity; but alſo he who being aſſaulted in ſuch a manner, and in ſuch a place, that he cannot go back without manifeſtly endanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his life, kills the other without retreating at all."—§ 16. "And an officer who kills one that inſults him in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his office, and where a private perſon, that kills one who feloniouſly aſſaults him in the high way, may juſtify the fact without ever giving back at all."</p>
                        <p>There is no occaſion for the Magiſtrate to read the Riot. act.— In the caſe before you, I ſuppoſe you will be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied when you come to examine the witneſſes, and compare it with the rules of the common law, abſtracted from all mutiny-acts and articles of war, that theſe ſoldiers were in ſuch a ſituation, that they could not help themſelves; peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were coming from <hi>Royal exchange-lane,</hi> and other parts of the town, with clubs, and cord wood ſticks; the ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were planted by the wall of the <hi>Cuſtom Houſe</hi>; they could not retreat, they were ſurrounded on all ſides, for there were people behind them, as well as before them; there were a number of people in <hi>Royal-exchange lane</hi>; the ſoldiers were ſo near to the <hi>Cuſtom houſe,</hi> that they could not retreat, unleſs they had gone into the brick wall of it. I ſhall ſhew you preſently, that all the party concerned in this unlawful deſign, were guilty of what any one of them did; if any body threw a ſnow-ball, it was the act of the whole party; if any ſtruck with a club, or threw a club, and the club had killed any body, the whole party would have been guilty of murder in law.</p>
                        <p>Ld. C. J. HOLT, in Mawgrige's Caſe, Keyling 128, ſaye, "Now it hath been held, that if A of his malice prepenſed
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:011683_0079_0F87C7FC629E4248"/>
aſſaults B, to kill him, and B draws his ſword and attacks A and purſues him, then A for his ſafety gives back, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats to a wall, and B ſtill purſuing him with his drawn ſword. A in his defence kills B. This is murder in A. For A having malice againſt B, and in purſuance thereof endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to kill him, is anſwerable for all the conſequences, of which he was the original cauſe. It is not reaſonable for any man that is dangerouſly aſſaulted, and when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives his life in danger from his adverſary, but to have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for the ſecurity of his own life, to purſue him that maliciouſly aſſaulted him; for he that hath manifeſted that he hath malice againſt another, is not fit to be truſted with a dangerous weapon in his hand. And ſo reſolved by all the Judges when they met at Seargeant's inn, in prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for my <hi>Lord Morley</hi>'s trial."</p>
                        <p>In the caſe here, we will take <hi>Montgomery,</hi> if you pleaſe, when he was attacked by the ſtout man with the ſtick, who aimed it at his head, with a number of people round him, crying out, Kill them! Kill them! had he not a right to kill the man. It all the party were guilty of the aſſault made by the ſtout man, and all of them had diſcovered malice in their hearts, had not <hi>Montgomery</hi> a right, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Holt,</hi> to put it one of their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to wreak their malice upon him. I will not at preſent, look for any more authorities in the point of ſelf-defence; you will be able to judge from theſe, how far the law goes, in juſtifying or excuſing any perſon in defence of himſelf, or taking away the life of another who threatens him, in life or limb: the next point is this, That in caſe of an unlawful aſſembly, all and every one of the aſſembly is guilty of all and every unlawful act, committed by any one of that aſſembly, in proſecution of the unlawful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign they ſet out upon.</p>
                        <p>Rules of law ſhould be univerſally known, what ever ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect they may have on politics; they are rules of common law, the law of the land, and it is certainly true, that where ever there is an unlawful aſſembly, let it conſiſt of many perſons or a few, every man in it is guilty of every unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful act of committed by any one of the whole party, be they more or be they leſs, in purſuance of their unlawful deſign. This is the policy of the law: to diſcourage and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent riots, inſurrections, turbulence and tumults.</p>
                        <p>In the continual viciſſitudes of human things, amidſt the
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:011683_0079_0F87C7FC629E4248"/>
ſhocks of fortune and the whirls of paſſion, that take place at certain critical ſeaſons, even in the mildeſt government, the people are liable to run into riots and tumults.—There are Church-quakes and ſtate-quakes, in the moral and political world, as well as earthquakes, ſtorms and tempeſts in the phyſical—Thus much however muſt be ſaid in favour of the people and of human nature, that it is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, if not univerſal truth, that the aptitude of the people to mutinies, ſeditions, tumults and inſurrections, is in direct proportion to the deſpotiſm of the government.— In governments compleatly deſpotic, <hi>i.e.</hi> where the will of one man, is the only law, this diſpoſition is moſt prevalent. —In Ariſtocracies, next—in mixed Monarchies, leſs than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the former—in compleat Republick's the leaſt of all —and under the ſame form of government as in a limited monarchy, for example, the virtue and wiſdom of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, may generally be meaſured by the peace and order, that are ſeen among the people.—However this may be, ſuch is the imperfection of all things in this world, that no form of government, and perhaps no wiſdom or virtue in the adminiſtration, can at all times avoid riots and diſorders among the people."</p>
                        <p>Now it is from this difficulty, that the policy of the law hath framed ſuch ſtrong diſcouragements, to ſecure the people againſt tumults; becauſe when they once begin, there is danger of their running to ſuch exceſſes, as will overturn the whole ſyſtem of government.— There is the rule from the reverend ſage of the law, ſo often quoted before.</p>
                        <p>I. H. H. P. C. 437. "All preſent, aiding and aſſiſting, are equally principal with him that gave the ſtroke, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the party died. For tho' one gave the ſtroke, yet in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of law, it is the ſtroke of every perſon, that was preſent aiding and aſſiſting."</p>
                        <p>I. H. H. P. C. 440. "If divers come with one aſſent to do miſchief, as to kill, rob, or beat, and one doth it, they are all principals in the felony. If many be preſent, and one only gives the ſtroke whereof the party dies, they are all principal, if they came for that purpoſe."</p>
                        <p>Now if the party at <hi>Deck-ſquare,</hi> came with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention only to beat the ſoldiers, and began the affray with them, and any of them had been accidentally killed, it would have been murder, becauſe it was an unlawful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:011683_0080_0F87C7FD1C7CA9E0"/>
they came upon; if but one does it, they are all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in the eye of the law to be guilty, if any one gives the mortal ſtroke, they are all principal here, therefore there is a reverſal of the ſcene; if you are ſatisfied, that theſe ſoldiers were there on a lawful deſign and it ſhould be proved any of them ſhot without provocation and killed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny body, he only is anſwerable for it. Firſt Hale's pleas of the crown.</p>
                        <p>I. H. H. P. C. 444. "Although if many come upon an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful deſign, and one of the company kill one of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe party, in purſuance of that deſign, all are principals; yet if many be together upon a lawful account, and one of the company, kill another of an adverſe party, without any particular abetment of the reſt to this fact of homicide they are not all guilty that are of the company, but only thoſe that gave the ſtroke or actually abetted him to do it."</p>
                        <p>I. H. H. P. C. 445. "In the caſe of a riotous aſſembly to rob or ſteal deer, or do any unlawful act of violence, there the offence of one, is the offence of all the company."</p>
                        <p>In an other place, I. H. H. P. C. 439. "The <hi>Lord Dacre</hi> and divers others went to ſteal deer in the park of one Pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham —Raydon one of the company, killed the keeper in the park: the <hi>Lord Dacre</hi> and the reſt of the company being in the other part of the park.

                        <p>Thus far I have proceeded, and I believe it will not be hereafter diſputed by any body, that this law ought to be known to every one who has any diſpoſition to be concerned in an unlawful aſſembly, whatever miſchief happens in the proſecution of the deſign they ſet out upon, all are anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for it. It is neceſſary we ſhould conſider the definitions of ſome other crimes, as well as murder; ſometimes one crime gives occaſion to another, an aſſault is ſometimes the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of man ſlaughter, ſometimes of excuſable homicide. It is neceſſary to conſider what is a riot. 1. <hi>Hawk.</hi> c. 65. § 2. I ſhall give you the definition of it. "Whereſoever more than three perſons uſes force or violence, for the accompliſhment of any deſign whatever, all concerned are rioters."</p>

And this is law, that wherever more than three perſons, are gathered together, to accompliſh any thing with force, it is a riot 1. <hi>Hawk.</hi> C. 65. § 2. "Wherever more than three, uſe force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, all who are concerned therein are rioters: But in ſome caſes wherein the law authoriſes force, it is lawful and commendable to uſe it.

                              <p>H. Lord Raymond 1496. His Lordſhip ſays, "From theſe caſes it appears, that though the law of England, is ſo far peculiarly favourable (I uſe the word peculiarly becauſe I know of no other law, that makes ſuch a diſtinction between Murder and Manſlaughter) as to permit the exceſs of anger and paſſion (which a man ought to keep under and govern) in ſome inſtances to extenuate the greateſt of private injuries, as the taking away a man's life is; yet in theſe caſes, it muſt be ſuch a paſſion, as for the time deprives him of his reaſoning faculties.</p>
                              <p>I ſhall not enter into any enquiry, how far the Admiralty ſeſſions in England, or a Special Court of Admiralty in America ought to proceed by the rules of civil law, though it is a queſtion of immenſe importance to Americans. But muſt beg leave to obſerve that though the diſtinction between Murder and Manſlaughter is not found in words in the civil law, yet the diſtinction between homicide, with deliberation and without deliberation, and on a ſudden provocation is well known in that law, and the former is puniſhed with death, the later, with ſome inferior corporal puniſhment at the diſcretion of the Judges.</p>
                              <p>Indeed, the civil law is more favourable, and indulgent to ſudden anger and reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than the common law, and allows many things to be a provocation ſufficient to exempt the perſon killing from the <hi>Paena ordinaria,</hi> which is death, which the common law conſiders as a ſlight provocation or none at all.</p>

                              <p>It ſhould ſeem from theſe authorities, that the lenity and indulgence of the laws of England, is not unnatural, extraordinary, or peculiar, and inſtead of being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known in the civil law, that it is carried much further in many reſpects than in the common law.—And indeed it ſeems that the like indulgence, was permitted in the Iewiſh law—though it has been ſo often repreſented as peculiar to the Engliſh law, that many perſons ſeem to think it unwarrantable, and tending to leave the guilt of blood upon the land.</p>
                           </note> We have hitherto been conſidering ſelf-defence, and how far perſons may go in defending themſelves againſt aggreſſors, even by taking away their lives, and now proceed to conſider, ſuch provocations as the law allows to mitigate or extenuate the guilt of killing, where it is not juſtifiable or excuſable.</p>

Now the law has been made on more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration than we are capable of making at preſent; the law conſiders a man as capable of bearing any thing, and every thing, but blows I may reproach a man as much as I pleaſe, I may call him a thief, robber, traitor, ſcoundrel, coward, lobſter, bloody back, &amp;c. and if he kills me it will be murder, if nothing elſe but words preceed; but if from giving him ſuch kind of language, I proceed to take him by the noſe, or fillip him on the forehead, that is, an aſſault! that is a blow; the law will not oblige a man to ſtand ſtill and bear it; there is the diſtinction; hands off, touch me not; as ſoon as you touch me, if I run you thro' the heart it is but Manſlaughter; the utility of this diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the more you think of it, the more you will be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it; it is an aſſault when ever a blow is ſtruck, let

it be ever ſo ſlight, and ſometimes even without a blow. The law conſiders man as frail and paſſionate, when his paſſions are touched, he will be thrown off his guard, and therefore the law makes allowances for this frailty, conſiders him as in a ſit of paſſion, not having the poſſeſſion of his intellect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual faculties, and therefore does not oblige him to meaſure out his blows with a yard ſtick, or weigh them in a ſcale; let him kill with a ſword, gun or hedge ſtake, it is not mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but only manſlaughter. Keyling's Reports 135. <hi>Regina verſus</hi> Mawgrige. "Rules ſupported by authority and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral conſent, ſhewing what are always allowed to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient provocations. Firſt, if one man, <hi>upon any words ſhall make an aſſault</hi> upon another, either by <hi>pulling him by the noſe, or filliping upon the forehead,</hi> and he that is ſo aſſaulted, ſhall draw his ſword, and immediately run the other through, that is but manſlaughter; for the peace is broken by the perſon killed, and with an indignity to him that received the aſſault. Beſides, he that was ſo affronted might reaſonably apprehend, that he that treated him in that manner, might have ſome further deſign upon him." So that here is the boundary, when a man is aſſaulted, and kills in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of that aſſault, it is but manſlaughter; I will juſt read as I go along the defintion of an aſſault. 1. Hawkin's Chap. 62. § 1. "An aſſault is an attempt or offer, with force or violence, to do a coporal hurt to another; as by ſtricking at him, with or without a weapon, or preſenting a gun at him, at ſuch a diſtance to which the gun will carry, or pointing a pitch-fork at him, or by any other ſuch like act done in an angry, threatning manner, &amp;c. But no words can amount to an aſſault." Here is the defintion of an aſſault, which is a ſufficient provocation to ſoften kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down to manſlaughter. 1. Hawkin's, Chap. 31. § 36. "Neither can he be thought guilty of a greater crime, than manſlaughter, who finding a man in bed with his wife, or being actually <hi>ſtruck by him,</hi> or <hi>pulled by the noſe,</hi> or <hi>filliped upon the forehead,</hi> immediately kills him, or in the defence of his perſon from an unlawful arreſt; or in the defence of his houſe, from thoſe who claiming a title to it, attempt forcibly to enter it, and to that purpoſe ſhoot at it, &amp;c." Every ſnow-ball, oyſter ſhell, cake of ice, or bit of cinder that was thrown that night, at the Sentinel, was an aſſault upon him; every one that was thrown at the party of ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, was an aſſault upon them, whether it hit any of
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:011683_0084_0F87C804A6BADB20"/>
them or not. I am guilty of an aſſault, if I preſent a gun at any perſon, whether I ſhoot at him or not, it is an aſſault, and if I inſult him in that manner, and he ſhoots me, it is but manſlaughter. Foſter, 295 6. "To what I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered with regard to ſudden rencounters, let me add, that the blood, already too much heated, kindleth afreſh at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry paſs or blow. And in the tumult of the paſſions, in which mere inſtinct ſelf preſervation, hath no inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſhare, the voice of reaſon is not heard. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the law in condeſenſion to the infirmities of fleſh and blood doth extenuate the offence." Inſolent, ſcurrilous, or ſlanderous language, when it preceeds an aſſault, aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates it. Foſter 316. "We all knew that words of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, how grating and offenſive ſoever, are in the eye of the law, no provocation, in the caſe of voluntary homicide, and yet every man who hath conſidered the human frame, or but attended to the workings of his own heart, knoweth, that affronts of that kind, pierce deeper, and ſtimulate in the veins more effectually, than a ſlight injury done to a third perſon, tho' under colour of juſtice, poſſibly can." I produce this to ſhow the aſſault, in this caſe, was aggravated by the ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous language which preceeded it. Such words of reproach, ſtimulate in the veins, and ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>I yeſterday afternoon produced from the beſt authorities, thoſe rules of law which muſt govern all caſes of homicide, particularly that which is now before you; it now remains to conſider the evidence, and ſee whether any thing has occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that may be compared to the rules read to you; and I will not trouble myſelf nor you with laboured endeavours to be methodical, I ſhall endeavour to make ſome few ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, on the teſtimonies of the witneſſes, ſuch as will place the facts in a true point of light, with as much brevity as poſſible; but I ſuppoſe it would take me four hours to read to you, (if I did nothing elſe but read) the
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:011683_0085_0F87C80562B05F00"/>
minutes of evidence that I have taken in this trial. In the firſt place the Gentleman who opened this cauſe, has ſtated to you, with candour and preciſion, the evidence of the iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the perſons.</p>
                        <p>The witneſſes are confident that they know the priſoners at the barr, and that they were preſent that night, and of the party; however, it is apparent, that witneſſes are lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make miſtakes, by a ſingle example before you. Mr. <hi>Baſs,</hi> who is a very honeſt man, and of good character, ſwears poſitively that the tall man, <hi>Warren,</hi> ſtood on the right that night, and was the firſt that fired; and I am ſure you are ſatisfied by this time, by many circumſtances, that he is totally miſtaken in this matter; this you will conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at your leiſure. The witneſſes in general did not know the faces of theſe perſons before; very few of them knew the names of them before, they only took notice of their faces that night. How much certainty there is in this evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, I leave you to determine.</p>
                        <p>There does not ſeem to me to be any thing very material in the teſtimony of Mr. <hi>Aſton,</hi> except to the identity of <hi>M'Cauley,</hi> and he is the only witneſs to that. If you can be ſatisfied in your own minds, without a doubt, that he knew <hi>M'Cauley</hi> ſo well as to be ſure, you will believe he was there.</p>
                        <p>The next witneſs is <hi>Bridgham,</hi> he ſays he ſaw the tall man <hi>Warren,</hi> but ſaw another man belonging to the ſame regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſoon after, ſo like him, as to make him doubt whether it was <hi>Warren</hi> or not; he thinks he ſaw the <hi>Corporal,</hi> but is not certain, he ſays he was at the corner of the <hi>Cuſtom houſe,</hi> this you will take notice of, other witneſſes ſwear, he was the remoteſt man of all from him who fired firſt, and there are other evidences who ſwear the left man did not fire at all; if <hi>Wemms</hi> did not diſcharge his gun at all, he could not kill any of the perſons, therefore he muſt be acquitted on the fact of killing; for an intention to kill, is not mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der nor manſlaughter, if not carried into execution: The witneſs ſaw numbers of things thrown, and he ſaw plainly ſticks ſtrike the guns, about a dozen perſons with ſticks, gave three cheers, and ſurrounded the party, and ſtruck the guns with their ſticks ſeveral blows: This is a witneſs for the crown, and his teſtimony is of great weight for the priſoners; he gives his teſtimony very ſenſibly and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially. He ſwears poſitively, that he not only ſaw ice or ſnow thrown, but ſaw the gus ſtruck ſeveral times; if you
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:011683_0085_0F87C80562B05F00"/>
believe this witneſs, of whoſe credibility you are wholly the Judges, as you are of every other; if you do not believe him, there are many others who ſwear to circumſtances in favour of the priſoners; it ſhould ſeem impoſſible you ſhould diſbelieve ſo great a number, and of crown witneſſes too, who ſwear to ſuch variety of circumſtances that fall in with one another ſo naturally to form our defence; this witneſs ſwears poſitively, there were a dozen of perſons with clubs, ſurrounded the party; twelve ſailors with clubs, were by much an overmatch to eight ſoldiers, chained there by the order and command of their officer, to ſtand in defence of the Sentry, not only ſo, but under an oath to ſtand there, <hi>i. e.</hi> to obey the lawful command of their officer, as much, Gentlemen of the Jury, as you are under oath to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine this cauſe be law and evidence; clubs they had not, and they could not defend themſelves with their bayonets againſt ſo many people; it was in the power of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But it is not at all improbable, that there was ſome miſunderſtanding about theſe looſe expreſſions; perhaps the man had no thoughts of what his words might import; many a man in his cups, or in anger, which is a ſhort fit of madneſs, hath uttered the raſheſt expreſſions, who had no ſuch ſavage diſpoſition in general: ſo that there is but little weight in expreſſions uttered at a kitching fire, before a maid and a coachman, where he might think himſelf at liberty to talk as much like a bully, a fool, and a madman as he pleaſed, and that no evil would come of it. Strictly ſpeaking, he might mean no more than this, that he would not miſs an opportunity of firing on the inhabitants, if he was attacked by them in ſuch a manner as to juſtify it: ſoldiers have ſometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided opportunities of firing, when they would have been juſtified, if they had fired.

It can ſcarcely amount to proof that he harboured any ſettled malice againſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in general. Other witneſſes are introduced to ſhow that <hi>Killroy</hi> had beſides his general ill will againſt every body, particular malice againſt Mr. <hi>Gray,</hi> whom he killed, as <hi>Langford</hi> ſwears.</p>
                        <p>Some of the witneſſes, have ſworn that <hi>Gray</hi> was active in the battle at the Rope walks, and that <hi>Killroy</hi> was once there, from whence the Council for the Crown would infer, that <hi>Killroy</hi>; in <hi>King ſtreet,</hi> on the 5th of <hi>March</hi> in the night, kenw <hi>Gray</hi> whom he had ſeen at the Rope-walks before, and took that opportunity to gratify his preconceived malice; but if this is all true, it will not take away from him his juſtification, excuſe, or extenuation, if he had any.— The rule of the law is, if there has been mallice between two, and at a diſtant time afterwards they met, and one of them aſſaults the other's life, or only aſſaults him, and he kills in conſequence of it, the law preſumes the killing was in ſelf defence, or upon the provocation, not on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the antecedent malice. If therefore the aſſault upon <hi>Killroy</hi> was ſo violent as to endanger his life, he had as good a right to defend himſelf, as much as if he never had before conceived any malice againſt the people in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or Mr. <hi>Gray</hi> in particular. If the aſſault upon him, was ſuch as to amount only to a provocation, not to a juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:011683_0087_0F87C809C6437C30"/>
his crime will be manſlaughter only. However, it does not appear, that he knew Mr. <hi>Gray</hi>; none of the witneſſes pretend to ſay he knew him, or that he ever ſaw him. It is true they were both at the Rope-walks at one time, but there were ſo many combatants on each ſide, that it is not even probable that <hi>Killroy</hi> ſhould know them all, and no witneſs ſays there was any rencounter there between them two. Indeed, to return to Mr. <hi>Langford</hi>'s teſtimony, he ſays, he did not perceive <hi>Killroy</hi> to aim at <hi>Gray,</hi> more than at him, but he ſays expreſsly, he did not aim at <hi>Gray.</hi> —<hi>Langford</hi> ſays, "<hi>Gray</hi> had no ſtick, was ſtanding with his arms folded up,"—This witneſs, is however moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably miſtaken in this matter and conſounds one time with another, a miſtake which has been made by many witneſſes, in this caſe, and conſidering the confuſion and terror of the ſcene, is not to be wondered at—</p>
                        <p>Witneſſes have ſworn to the condition of <hi>Killroy's</hi> bayo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, that it was bloody the morning after the 5th of <hi>March.</hi> —The blood they ſaw, if any, might be occaſioned by a wound given by ſome of the bayonets in the affray, poſſibly in Mr. <hi>Poſdick</hi>'s arm, or it might happen, in the manner mentioned by my brother before.—One bayonet at leaſt was ſtruck off and it might fall, where the blood of ſome perſon ſlain afterwards flowed.—It would be doing vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to every rule of law and evidence, as well as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe and the feelings of humanity, to infer from the blood on the bayonet, that it had been ſtabbed into the brains of Mr. <hi>Gray</hi> after he was dead, and that by <hi>Killroy</hi> himſelf who had killed him.</p>
                        <p>Young Mr. <hi>Davis</hi> ſwears, that he ſaw <hi>Gray</hi> that evening, a little before the firing, that he had a ſtick under his arm, and ſaid he would go to the riot, "I am glad of it, (that is that there was a rumpus) I will go and have a ſlap at them, if I loſe my life."—And when he was upon the ſpot, ſome wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes ſwear, he did not act that peaceable inoffenſive part, which <hi>Langford</hi> thinks he did.—They ſwear, they thought him in liquor—that he run about clapping ſeveral people on the ſhoulders ſaying, "Dont run away"—"they dare not fire" <hi>Langford</hi> goes on "I ſaw twenty or five and twenty boys about the Sentinal—and I ſpoke to him, and bid him not be afraid."—How came the Watchman <hi>Langford</hi> to tell him not to be afraid.

it from what has been ſaid by people out of Court, or, publiſhed in the news-papers, or delivered from the pulpits.</p>
                        <p>Having premiſed theſe things, I ſhall obſerve to you, the ſeveral queſtions that ariſe in this caſe; and point out to you the manner in which I think they may be beſt conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and determined.</p>
                        <p>The principal queſtions are theſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
                           <list>
                              <item>I. Whether the five perſons ſaid to be murdered, were in fact killed? And if ſo.</item>
                              <item>II. Whether they, or either of them were killed by the priſoners, or either of them? And if they were, then</item>
                              <item>III. Whether ſuch killing was juſtifiable, excuſable, or felouious? And if the latter,</item>
                              <item>IV. Whether it was manſlaughter or murder?</item>
                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>As to the firſt, you have not only the corouer's inqueſt, but the teſtimony of ſo many witneſſes, that the five perſons were ſhot and thereby mortally wounded in the night of the 5th of <hi>March</hi> laſt, and that ſome of them died inſtantly, and the reſt in a few days after, that you doubtleſs will be ſatisfied they were all killed. And the ſame evidence muſt I think alſo convince you, that they were all killed by the party of ſoldiers that were at the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe</hi> that night, or by ſome of them.</p>
                        <p>Whether the priſoners were there, will therefore be your next enquiry; for if either of them was not, he muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted. You have the teſtimony of <hi>Bridgham</hi> and <hi>Simpſon</hi> as to <hi>Wemms</hi>; of <hi>Danbrooke</hi> and <hi>Simpſon</hi> as to <hi>Hartegan,</hi> of <hi>Auſtin</hi> as to <hi>M'Cauley</hi>; of <hi>Simpſon, Langford. Bailey</hi> and <hi>Clark</hi> as to <hi>White</hi>; of <hi>Archibaid, Langford</hi> and <hi>Brewer</hi> as to <hi>Killroy</hi>; of <hi>Dodge</hi> and <hi>Simpſon</hi> as to <hi>Warren</hi>; and of <hi>Bailey, Baſs, Palmes, Danbrooks</hi> and <hi>Wilkinſon</hi> as to <hi>Montgomery</hi>'s being at the <hi>Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom houſe</hi> that night, and of the party of ſoldiers that was there; and this is not conteſted with any oppoſite proof.— The law doth not in this caſe make the teſtimony of two witneſſes neceſſary for the Jury to ſettle a fact upon: If one ſwears it, and upon his teſtimony you believe it, that is ſufficient evidence for you to find the fact. But if you are ſatisfied upon the evidence, that all the priſoners were there, yet, as each priſoner is ſeverally charged with having killed theſe five perſons, and by his plea has denied the charge, you muſt be fully ſatisfied upon the evidence given you, with regard to each priſoner, that he in particular,
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:011683_0095_0F87C814D3744150"/>
did <hi>in fact,</hi> or <hi>in conſideration of law,</hi> kill one or more of theſe perſons that were ſlain, or he muſt be acquitted.</p>
                        <p>The way therefore to determine this, will be for you to name ſome one of the priſoners, and then conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it appears upon the evidence in the caſe, that he did <hi>in fact</hi> kill <hi>Maverick?</hi> And then, whether upon the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence it appears, he <hi>in fact</hi> killed <hi>Gray?</hi> And ſo enquire in the ſame manner, whether he did <hi>in fact</hi> kill either of the other three perſons? And having noted how it appears up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the evidence with regard to him; you muſt then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in like manner with each of the other priſoners; and if upon a full conſideration of the evidence in the caſe, you ſhould be in doubt, as to any one of the priſouers having <hi>in fact</hi> killed either of the perſons that were ſlain, you muſt conſider whether he did it <hi>in conſideration of law?</hi> Now all that are preſent, aiding and abetting one perſon in killing another, do, in judgment of law, kill him. The ſtroke of one is, in conſideration of law, the ſtroke of all. When a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of perſons aſſemble together to do an unlawful act, and in proſecution of that deſign, one of them kills a man, all the reſt of the company are in law conſidered as abetting him to do it.<note n="(a)" place="bottom">1. <hi>Hale.</hi> 440, 1. <hi>Foſt.</hi> 351,</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>You muſt therefore enquire how, and for what purpoſe, the priſoners came together at the <hi>Cuſtom houſe,</hi> and what they did there before theſe perſon were killed?</p>
                        <p>The Council for the priſoners ſay, that, if they were at the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe</hi> that night, they went there by order of the <hi>Captain</hi> of the <hi>Main-guard,</hi> to ſupport and protect the Sentry, who was inſulted, aſſaulted and abuſed by a conſiderable number of people, aſſembled for that purpoſe; but as this is denied by the Council for the Crown, it will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to conſider whether, a Sentry was duly placed at the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe?</hi> And if ſo, whether he was attacked? And if ſo, whether the priſoners went by order of the <hi>Captain,</hi> to ſupport and protect him?</p>
                        <p>That a Sentry was in fact then placed at the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe,</hi> by order of Colonel <hi>Dairymple,</hi> the Commanding Officer, as alſo that one had been placed there for a long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is teſtified by Capts. <hi>O' Hara,</hi> and <hi>Maſon,</hi> and indeed the right to place Sentries, (it being in time of peace) is the only thing that has been queſtioned. Upon this, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:011683_0095_0F87C814D3744150"/>
I would obſerve, that as the main deſign of ſociety, is the protection of individuals by the united ſtrength of the whole community; ſo for the ſake of unanimity, ſtrength and diſpatch, the ſupreme executive power is by the Britiſh conſtitution veſted in a ſingle perſon, the King or Queen. This ſingle perſon has the ſole power of raiſing fleets or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and the Statute of 13 <hi>Car</hi> 2. c. 6. declares, That within all his Majeſty's realms and <hi>dominions,</hi> the ſole ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme government, command and <hi>diſpoſition</hi> of the militia, and of <hi>all forces</hi> by ſea and land, and <hi>all ſorts</hi> and <hi>places of ſtrength</hi> is, and by the law of <hi>England</hi> ever was, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted right of his Majeſty and his royal Predeceſſors, Kings and Queens of <hi>England.</hi> And as <hi>Charles</hi> the Second had this right as King of <hi>England,</hi> it of courſe comes to his ſucceſſors, and our preſent Soverereign Lord the King, now hath it.</p>
                        <p>Indeed the Bill of Rights declares among other things, That the raiſing or keeping a ſtanding army, within the kingdom, in a time of peace, unleſs with the conſent of Parliament, is againſt law. And it is ſaid, that upon the ſame principles whereon that declaration was founded, it is alike unlawful to be doue in any other part of the King's dominious. But be that as it may, the Mutiny Acts annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally made, ſhew the conſent of Parliament, that the King in time of peace ſhould keep up a ſtanding army not only in the Kingdom, but in <hi>America</hi> alſo. They not only aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the number of troops that ſhall be kept up, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the regulation of ſuch of the King's troops as are in <hi>America.</hi> And therefore as by theſe acts the King is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to keep up theſe troops, and he, by common law, has the command and diſpoſition of all forces by ſea and land within his dominions, and is the principal conſervator of the peace, he doubtleſs, well might ſend ſuch part of thoſe troops to this part of his dominions, in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the public peace, or to aid and aſſiſt the civil Magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate in preſerving of it, as he judged neceſſary for the purpoſe; and if you ſhould think there was no occaſion for ſending any troops here, for either of thoſe purpoſes, that will not alter the caſe, becauſe the King being the proper judge in that matter, the validity of his order will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the truth of the repreſentations whereon it is founded. The acts not only fix the number of troops to be kept up, but alſo eſtabliſh a law martial for their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:011683_0096_0F87C815D6C85DF0"/>
Among other things, the Acts ſubject every officer or ſoldier that ſleeps on his poſt, or leaves it before he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, or diſobeys the <hi>lawful</hi> command of his ſuperior of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, to ſuch puniſhment as a Court Martial ſhall inflict,— though it extend to death itſelf. Theſe troops are, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſince they came here, have been under this martial law, and ſubject to as ſtrict regulation, as in time of war. Plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sentries is a neceſſary part of the regulation of our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, accordingly a Sentry hath in fact been kept at the <hi>Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom-houſe,</hi> ever ſince the troops have been here; and it is ſworn, by the Captains <hi>O' Hara</hi> and <hi>Maſon,</hi> that it was done by order of the Commanding Officer. If ſo, you have no reaſon to doubt but that it was legally done.</p>
                        <p>Your next enquiry then will be, whether the Sentry ſo placed at the <hi>Cuſtom houſe</hi> was attacked? Many witneſſes have ſworn that he was. But the Council for the Crown ſay, the contrary appears by the teſtimony of Col. <hi>Marſhal</hi> and others.</p>
                        <p>It is with you to determine this matter upon the whole of the evidence given you. In doing it you ought to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the ſeveral teſtimonies, if by any reaſonable conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the words it may be done.— Where ſome witneſſes ſwear they ſaw ſuch a thing done, and others ſwear they were preſent and did not ſee it: if the thing ſaid to be done be ſuch as it may reaſonably be ſuppoſed ſome might ſee and others not, by reaſon of their want of obſervation, or particular attention to other matters there, as both may be true, you ought to ſuppoſe them to be ſo, rather than pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume that any of the witneſſes ſwear falſly. But if witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes contradict each other, ſo that their teſtimonies cannot be reconciled, you muſt then conſider the number of the witneſſes on each ſide, their ability, integrity, indifference as to the point in queſtion, and the probability or improbability ariſing from the nature of the thing in queſtion, and upon the whole ſettle the fact as you verily believe it to be. If you find the Sentry was attacked, the next thing to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered is, whether the priſoners went to protect him, and it ſo, whether it was lawful for them ſo to do. There is a great difference between a common affray, and attacking the King's forces. I think the law in that regard ought to be more generally known here than it ſeems to be. If up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſudden quarrel from ſome affront given or taken, the neighbourhood riſe and drive the King's forces out of their

                        <p>And it is ſaid, that while they were at the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe,</hi> before they fired, ſome of them attempted with their bayo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets to ſtab every one they could come at, without any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at all for ſo doing. Such conduct to be ſure can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be juſtified nor excuſed. But as the time was ſo very ſhort, and ſome of the witneſſes declare the people were crouding upon the ſoldiers, and that they were moving
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:011683_0097_0F87C815DFCB38A0"/>
their guns backwards and forwards crying ſtand off, ſtand off, without moving from their ſtation, you will conſider whether this may not be what other witneſſes call an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to ſtab the people. But, be that as it may, if the party was a lawful aſſembly before, this not being the act of the whole, would not make it unlawful. The Council for the Crown inſiſt that the firing upon the people was an unlawful act, in diſturbance of the peace, and as the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fired ſo near together, it muſt be ſuppoſed they previouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreed to do it; that agreement made them an unlawful aſſembly, if they were not ſo before, and being ſo when they fired, all are chargeable with the killing by any one or more of them. However juſt this reaſoning may be, where there is no apparent cauſe for their firing, yet it will not hold good where there is. If each of the party had been at the ſame inſtant ſo aſſaulted, as that it would have juſtified his killing the aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

But it is ſaid that if their firing as they did, don't prove a previous agreement to do it, yet it is good evidence of an actual abetment to fire, as one by firing encourages the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to do the like. As neither of the ſoldiers fired more than once, it is evident that he who fired laſt, could not thereby in fact, abet or encourage the firing of any of thoſe who fired before him, and ſo it cannot be evidence of
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:011683_0098_0F87C8169D3A0670"/>
ſuch abetment. And if he who fired firſt and killed, can juſtify it, becauſe it was lawful for him ſo to do, ſurely that ſame lawful act cannot be evidence of an unlawful abetment. And though he who firſt fired and killed, may not be able to juſtify the doing it, yet if it appears he had ſuch a cauſe for the killing as will reduce it to Manſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it would be ſtrange indeed if that ſame act ſhould be evidence of his abetting another who killed without provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, ſo as to make him who fired firſt guilty of murder. The ſame may be ſaid as to all the intermediate firings: and, as the evidence ſtands, I don't think it neceſſary to ſay how it would be in caſe the firſt perſon fired with little or no provocation. If therefore this party of ſoldiers, when at the <hi>Cuſtom houſe,</hi> were a lawful aſſembly and continued ſo until they fired, and their firing was not an actual <hi>unlawful</hi> abetment of each other to fire, nor evidence of it, they cannot be ſaid to have <hi>in conſideration of law</hi> killed thoſe five perſons or either of them, but it muſt reſt on the evidence of the actual killing: and, if ſo, neither of the priſoners can be found guilty thereof, unleſs it appears not only that he was of the party, but that he in particular <hi>in fact</hi> did kill one or more of the perſons ſlain. That the five perſons were killed by the party of ſoldiers or ſome of them, ſeems clear upon the evidence, and indeed is not diſputed.</p>
                        <p>Some witneſſes have been produced to prove that <hi>Montgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery</hi> killed <hi>Attucks</hi>; and <hi>Langford</hi> ſwears <hi>Kulroy</hi> killed <hi>Gray,</hi> but none of the witneſſes undertake to ſay that either of the other priſoners in particular killed either of the other three perſons, or that all of them did it. On the contrary it ſeems that one of the ſix did not fire, and that another of them fired at a boy as he was running down the ſtreet, but miſſed him (if he had killed him, as the evidence ſtands, it would have been murder) but the witneſſes are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed as to the perſon who fired at the boy, or as to him who did not fire at all. It is highly probable, from the places where the five perſons killed fell and their wounds, that they were killed by the diſcharge of five ſeveral guns only. If you are upon the evidence, ſatisfied of that, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that <hi>Montgomery</hi> killed <hi>Attucks,</hi> and <hi>Killroy Gray,</hi> it will thence follow that the other three, were killed, not by the other ſix priſoners, but by three of them only: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they cannot all be found guilty of it. And as the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence does not ſhew which three killed the three, nor that
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:011683_0098_0F87C8169D3A0670"/>
either of the ſix in particular killed either of the three, you cannot find either of the ſix guilty of killing them or either them <note n="(g)" place="bottom">1 <hi>Hale</hi> 442.</note> If you are ſatisfied, upon the evidence gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you, that <hi>Montgomery</hi> killed <hi>Attucks,</hi> you will proceed to inquire whether it was juſtifiable, excuſable, or felonious homicide, and it the latter whether it was maliciouſly done or not. As he is charged with murder, if the fact of killing be proved, all the circumſtances of <hi>neceſſity</hi> or <hi>infirmity</hi> are to be ſatisfactorily proved by him, unleſs they ariſe out of the evidence produced againſt him, for the law preſumeth the fact to have been founded in malice untill the contrary ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears.<note n="(h)" place="bottom">

                        <p>You will therefore, carefully conſider and weigh the whole of the evidence given you reſpecting the attack, made upon the party of ſoldiers <hi>in general,</hi> and upon <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery</hi> in particular. In doing it, you will obſerve the rules I have before mentioned, and not forget the part that ſome of the witneſſes took in this unhappy affair, and if upon the whole it appears to you, that <hi>Montgomery</hi> was attacked, in ſuch a violent manner, as that his life was in immediate danger, or that he had ſufficient reaſon to think it was, and he thereupon fired and killed <hi>Attucks,</hi> for the preſervation of his own life, it was juſtifiable homicide; and he ought to be acquitted.—If you do not believe that was, the caſe, but upon the evidence are ſatisfied, that he was by that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, aſſaulted with clubs and other weapons, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon fired at the rioters and killed <hi>Attucks</hi>: then you ought to find him guilty of manſlaughter only. But if upon the evidence you believe, that <hi>Montgomery,</hi> without being previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly aſſaulted, fired, and killed <hi>Attucks</hi>: then you will find him guilty of muder But you muſt know, that if this party of ſoldiers <hi>in general</hi> were pelted, with ſnow-balls, pieces of ice and ſticks, <hi>in anger,</hi> this, without more, amounts to an aſſault, not only upon thoſe that were in fact ſtruck, but upon the whole party; and is ſuch an aſſault as will reduce the killing to manſlaughter. And if you believe, what ſome of the witneſſes have ſworn, that the people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round the ſoldiers, and many of them armed with clubs, crouded upon the ſoldiers, and with the cry of, "Ruſh on, Kill them, Kill them, Knock them over," did in fact ruſh on, ſtrike at them with their clubs, and give <hi>Montgomery</hi>
                           <pb n="195" facs="unknown:011683_0099_0F87C8176229D1B0"/>
ſuch a blow, as to knock him down, as ſome of the witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſay, or to make him ſally, or ſtagger, as others ſay—it will be ſufficient to ſhow, that his life was in immediate danger, or that he had ſufficient reaſon to think ſo.</p>
                        <p>It ſeems, a doctrine, has of late been advanced, "that ſoldiers while on duty, may upon <hi>no occaſion whatever</hi> fire upon their fellow ſubjects, without the order of a civil magiſtrate." This may poſſibly account, for ſome of thoſe who attacked the ſolders, ſaying to them, "You dare not fire, we know you dare not fire."—But it ought to be known, that the law doth not countenance ſuch an abſurd doctrine. A man by becoming a ſoldier, doth not thereby loſe the right of ſelf-defence which is founded in the law of nature. Where any one is, without his own default, reduced to ſuch circumſtances, as that the laws of ſociety cannot avail him, the law conſiders him, "as <hi>ſtill in that inſtance</hi> under the protection of the law of nature."<note n="(i)" place="bottom">
                              <hi>Foſter</hi> 274, 5.</note> This rule extends to ſoldiers as well as others; nay, while ſoldiers are in the immediate ſervice of the King, and the regular diſcharge of their duty, they rather come within the <hi>reaſon,</hi> of civil officers and their aſſiſtants, and ſo are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like under the <hi>peculiar</hi> protection of the law.</p>
                        <p>If you are ſatisfied upon the evidence, that <hi>Killroy</hi> killed <hi>Gray,</hi> you will then enquire, whether it was juſtifiable, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable or felonious homicide, and if the latter, whether it was with, or without malice. If the attack was upon the party of ſoldiers <hi>in general,</hi> and in the manner I have juſt mentioned, as ſome of the witneſſes ſay it was, it is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an aſſault upon all, whether all were in fact ſtruck, or not, and makes no material difference, as to their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive right of firing: for a man is not obliged to wait un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he is killed, or ſtruck, before he makes uſe of the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary means of ſelf defence. If the blows with clubs were, by an enraged multitude, aimed at the party <hi>in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> each one might reaſonably think his own life in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; for though he eſcaped the firſt blow, he might rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably expect more would follow, and could have no aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, that he ſhould be ſo fortunate as to eſcape all of them.</p>
                        <p>And therefore, I do not ſee but that <hi>Killroy</hi> is upon the ſame ſooting with <hi>Montgomery;</hi> and your verdict muſt be
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:011683_0099_0F87C8176229D1B0"/>
the ſame as to both, unleſs what <hi>Hemmingway</hi> ſwears <hi>Killroy</hi> ſaid, or the affray at the Rope-walk, or both, materially vary the caſe. <hi>Hemmingway</hi> ſwears, that he and <hi>Killroy</hi> were talking about the town's people and the ſoldiers, and that <hi>Killroy</hi> ſaid. "He never would miſs an opportunity, when he had one, to fire on the inhabitants, and that he had wanted to have an opportunity, ever ſince he landed." But he ſays, he cannot remember what words immediately preceded or followed, or at what particular time the words were uttered, nor does he know whether <hi>Killroy</hi> was jocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, or not. If the witneſs is not miſtaken as to the words, the ſpeech was at leaſt, very imprudent and fooliſh. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if <hi>Killroy,</hi> either in Jeſt or in earneſt, uttered thoſe words, yet if the aſſault upon him was ſuch, as would juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify his firing and killing, or alleviate it ſo as to make it but manſlaughter, that will not inhance the killing to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. And though it has been ſworn that <hi>Killroy</hi> and other ſoldiers, had a quarrel with <hi>Gray</hi> and others, at the Rope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walk, a few days before the 5th <hi>March,</hi> yet it is not certain that <hi>Killroy</hi> then knew <hi>Gray,</hi> or armed at him in particular: But if <hi>Gray</hi> encouraged the aſſault by clapping the aſſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants on their backs, as <hi>Hink<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If there be "malice between A and B, and they meet caſually, A aſſaults B, and drives him to the wall, B in in his own defence kills A, this is <hi>ſe defendendo,</hi> and ſhall not be heightened by the former malice, into murder or homicide at large, for it was not a killing upon the account of the former malice, but upon a neceſſity im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon him by the aſſault of A<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>"<note n="(k)" place="bottom">1 <hi>Hale</hi> 479.</note> So upon the ſame principle, where the aſſault is ſuch as would make the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling but manſlaughter, if there had been no previous quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, the killing ought to be attributed to the aſſault, unleſs the evidence clearly ſhews the contrary: an <hi>aſſault</hi> being

It may be too late for them to repair to for juſtice: but I truſt, that the ancient virtue and ſpirit of this people will return and the law be eſtabliſhed on a firm baſis. If you, Gentlemen, have ſeen or read any of the libels which have been publiſhed, and have imbibed prejudices of any ſort, I do now charge you, in that ſacred Name which you have in the moſt ſolemn manner invoked for the faithful diſcharge of your preſent truſt, to diveſt your minds of every thing that may tend to biaſs them in this cauſe: it is your duty to fix your eyes ſolely on the ſcales of juſtice and as the

                        <p>As to the pains which have been taken to exculpate this town from being concerned in the fatal action of that night, they ſeen to me to have been unneceſſary. It is true, there hath been, in times paſt, no place more remarkable for order and good government than this town; but as it is a ſeaport town and of great trade, it is not to be wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, that the inhabitants of it ſhould be infected with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order as well as other populous places.</p>

                           <hi>John Gridley</hi> hath told you, that he heard numbers before the <hi>Town-houſe</hi> ſay, GOD <hi>damn the raſcals,</hi> ſome ſaid, <hi>this will never do, the readieſt way to get rid of thoſe people, is to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack the Main-guard, ſtrike at the root, this is the neſt</hi>; others replied, <hi>damn you, that's right.</hi> All this was before the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers had formed.</p>
                        <p>It would be too tedious to recite the numbers of teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to prove a deſign to attack the ſoldiers: I have ſelected a few, which ſeem to prove the intent, for there are no leſs than <hi>thirty eight</hi> witneſſes to this fact, <hi>ſix</hi> of whom the council for the King have produced.

                        <p>I will return now to the ſoldiers and view their behaviour whilſt they were going upon duty at the <hi>Cuſtom houſe,</hi> and whilſt they were there.

                        <p>Now conſider whether the priſoners had any juſt provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to fire upon ihe inhabitants, for that ſome of them did fire, you can be in no doubt There are <hi>twenty five</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes who have ſworn to <hi>ice, ſnow-balls, ſticks,</hi> &amp;c. being thrown at the priſoners, <hi>ten</hi> of whom, are wineſſes for the Crown. There are nigh <hi>thirty</hi> witneſſes who have ſworn to words of provocation uttered againſt the priſoners, as dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to fire, and threatning to kill them; but you muſt remember that words only, are no provocation in law to juſtify the killing of a perſon; but if threatning expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are attended with an attempt on the life of a man, in ſuch a caſe a killing may be juſtified; and if any ſuch facts appear in this trial, you muſt conſider them thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

            <p>MANY Gentlemen having expreſſed a deſire, that ſome account of the evidence as it appeared on the trial of <hi>Edward Manwarring, John Munro, Hammond Green,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Greenwood</hi> ſhould be made public, we have, for the ſatisfaction of ſuch, who wiſh to be made acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the real ſtate of facts reſpecting the above four perſons, inſerted by way of appendix from the minutes of a gentleman who attended the trial, the ſubſtance of what the witneſſes produced, as well on the part of the Crown, as of the priſoners, teſtified on that trial.</p>
            <p>The priſoners were charged by the Grand Jury, with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>preſent,</hi> aiding, abetting and aſſiſting, &amp;c. <hi>William War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren</hi> in the murder of <hi>Criſpus Attucks</hi>; as is at large ſet forth in the indictment, at the beginning of the preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing trial.</p>
            <p>This trial came on the 12th day of <hi>December</hi> laſt, and (<hi>Jonathan Sewall,</hi>

               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> conducted the cauſe on the part of the Crown.</p>
            <p>After the Jury were impaneled, Mr. <hi>Quincy</hi> opened the facts on which he expected to ſupport the charge againſt the priſoners; and then called the following witneſſes.</p>

               <p>I am an apprentice to Mr. <hi>Edward Manwarring.</hi> On the evening of the 5th <hi>March</hi> laſt, I was at Mr. <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s in <hi>Back-ſtreet,</hi> at the <hi>North end,</hi> where my maſter then lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Mr. <hi>Hudſon</hi> and his wife were at home; when the bells rung I ran into <hi>King ſtreet,</hi> and to the door of the <hi>Cuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe</hi> which was on a jarr partly open, and a young man one <hi>Green,</hi> he with one eye, (<hi>pointing to Hammond Green</hi>) o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the door and pulled me in; two or three gentlemen came down ſtairs, and one of them a tall man, pulled me up ſtairs, and ſaid to me, you muſt fire, the tall man gave me a gun, and ſaid to me "<hi>if you don't fire I'll kill you.</hi>"— I went up ſtairs and ſtood at a front window in the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and the tall man loaded two guns with two balls each, and I fired them both; as ſoon as I had fired one gun, he, the tall man, ſaid again to me, "<hi>if you don't fire I will kill
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:011683_0107_0F87C7D67222EE30"/>
you.</hi>" He had a cane with a ſword in it in his hand, and compelled me to fire both the guns. After I had fired theſe two guns, Mr. <hi>Manwarring</hi> fired one gun alſo out of the ſame window. The tall man loaded the three guns, and I ſee him put the balls into each of them and heard them go gown. The two guns I fired, I pointed up the ſtreet and in the air. When my maſter Mr. <hi>Manwarring</hi> pointed his gun out of the window I was in the room, but went out and was on the ſtairs before his gun went off, I heard it, but did not ſee it. As ſoon as I had fired, the tall man took me down ſtairs, and ſaid he would give me money if I would not tell: I replied, I did not want any money, but if I was called before the Juſtices, I would tell the truth. There were a great many people in the houſe, and a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of people round me in the chamber where I fired, I can't tell the preciſe number, but there were more than ten, Mr. <hi>Munro</hi> and <hi>Hammond Green</hi> were in the houſe below ſtairs, Mr. <hi>Manwarring</hi> was in the chamber when all the three guns were lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There was a candle in the chamber, but I cannot tell whether there were one or two windows in it. When I came up into the chamber, there were two guns in it, I fired twice out of the ſame gun, but I cannot tell whether Mr. <hi>Manwarring</hi> fired the ſame gun I did. At the time I and my maſter fired, the ſtreet below was full of people, and the mob were throwing ſticks, ſnow-balls, &amp;c. It was pretty dark, but I don't know but there might be a little moon. I can't tell whether the guns my maſter and I fired, were fired before or after the firing by the ſoldiers. When I went from Mr. <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s to the <hi>Cuſtom houſe,</hi> I paſſed through the lane that leads from the <hi>Market</hi> to the <hi>Cuſtom houſe,</hi> (<hi>Royal-exchange-lane</hi>) and I did not ſee the Sentry box or any ſoldiers near the <hi>Cuſtom houſe</hi>; there were many people round there in the ſtreet. Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after I went down ſtairs, I went out of the houſe and ſaw a great number of people throwing ſnow-balls and ſticks, but I ſaw no ſoldiers. I returned to Mr. <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s houſe, Mr <hi>Hudſon</hi> and his wife were then at home, and no other perſon in the houſe. Upon being again aſked where he was when he heard the report of his maſter's gun? Says, he was quite down ſtairs. Upon being aſked whether he was not ſoon after his commitment taken out of goal and

               <p>Mr. <hi>Quincy</hi> declaring he had no further evidence to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce on the part of the Crown. The priſoners deſired the following witneſſes might be ſworn and examined, which was done accordingly.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Edward Paine, George Bethane,</hi> and <hi>Edward Davis,</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and <hi>Harriſon Gray</hi> junr. they teſtified, That they ſtood oppoſite the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe</hi> on the evening of the 5th of <hi>March</hi> laſt, when the firing was in <hi>King ſtreet</hi> that their faces were towards the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe.</hi> That the moon ſhone ſtrong on the houſe, that they did not ſee the balcony door of the <hi>Cuſtom houſe</hi> open that evening, or any perſon in the balcony, or any window in the front of the houſe open, or guns fired from either the balcony or any of the windows in the front of the houſe, and are fully ſatisfied no ſuch thing could have happened while the ſoldiers were there with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their obſerving it. That they ſtood oppoſite the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe</hi> in full view of it from he time the ſoldiers firſt came down there until all the guns were diſcharged. That they are ſatisfied the whole of the firing was from the ſtreet, and that all above was quiet, and no light in any of the front rooms of the <hi>Cuſtom houſe.</hi> Mr. <hi>Davis</hi> added, that ſoon after the firing he ſaw two women ſtanding at the chamber win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe,</hi> which is next to <hi>Royal-exchange-lane,</hi> with their hands under their aprons, in the poſture of ſpectators.</p>
