         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <p>THE pri≈øoners at the bar, are that party of ≈øoldiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to his Maje≈øty's 29th regiment, who in the evening of the 5th of <hi>March</hi> la≈øt, were induced from ≈øome cau≈øe or other to fire on the inhabitants of this town, in <hi>King ≈øtreet.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>They are charged in five di≈øtinct indictments, with the wilful premeditated murder of five different per≈øons mentioned in the re≈øpective bills; to each of the≈øe indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they have ≈øeverally pleaded, <hi>not guilty</hi>; and by that plea have thrown upon the crown the burthen of proving the fact alledged again≈øt them: It is my province therefore to give you evidence in ≈øupport of this charge, and yours, gentlemen of the Jury, to determine whether they are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or not.</p>
                        <p>The cau≈øe is ≈øolemn and important; no le≈øs than whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eight of your fellow ≈øubjects ≈øhall live or die! A cau≈øe grounded on the mo≈øt melancholy event that has yet taken place on the continent of <hi>America,</hi> and perhaps of the greate≈øt expectation of any that has yet come before a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal of civil ju≈øtice, in this part of the <hi>Briti≈øh</hi> dominions.</p>
                        <p>I am aware how difficult, in ca≈øes of this ≈øort, it ever is, and more e≈øpecially ≈øo in <hi>the≈øe times,</hi> and in <hi>this trial,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve the mind perfectly indifferent; but I remember, we are bound, not only by the natural obligations towards God and man, but al≈øo by an oath, to examine into the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of fact without <hi>partiality</hi> or <hi>prejudice;</hi> I need not therefore caution you of your duty in this re≈øpect: It is upon that evidence and the law re≈øulting from it, you gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen are, in the language of your oath, to give a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict; and I will venture, before hand, to pronounce that verdict <hi>righteous,</hi> if it is founded in the≈øe principles as the rule of your judgment.</p>
                        <p>It has become my duty, it ≈øhall therefore be my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor, to acquit my≈øelf in the cour≈øe of this trial with

                        <p>In ≈øupport of this accu≈øation again≈øt the pri≈øoners at the bar, it is incumbent on the crown, to a≈øcertain the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things; viz. The indentity of the per≈øons charged; the fact of killing; and the circum≈øtances attending and aggravating that fact.</p>
                        <p>To this end, I ≈øhall immediately produce to you ≈øuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, from the te≈øtimony of credible witne≈ø≈øes, as may be ≈øufficient to ≈øu≈øtain the ≈øeveral indictments, and when I have gone through the examination, make ≈øuch remarks upon it, as may be mo≈øt conci≈øe and pertinent to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent i≈ø≈øue.</p>

               <p>Yes. The bells began to ring, and the people cryed fire: I run with the re≈øt, and went into <hi>King-≈øtreet</hi>; I a≈øked where the fire was; I was told there was no fire, but that the ≈øoldiers at <hi>Murray</hi>'s barracks had got out, and had been fighting with the inhabitants, but that they had drove them back again. I went to the barracks, and found the affair was over there. I came back, and ju≈øt as I got to the Town pump, I ≈øaw twenty or five and twenty boys going into <hi>King-≈øtreet.</hi> I went into <hi>King-≈øtreet</hi> my≈øelf, and ≈øaw ≈øeveral boys and young men about the Sentry box at the <hi>Cu≈øtom hou≈øe.</hi> I a≈øked them what was the matter.

               <p>I do not know; when he went up the ≈øteps he levelled his piece with his bayonet fixed.

               <p>I heard, damn you fire: it ≈øeemed to me as it came from the Sentry-box where I left the <hi>Captain.</hi> I was then by <hi>Vernon</hi> the barber's ≈øhop; I had pa≈ø≈øed acro≈øs the ≈øtreet. I ≈øaw a man going to throw a club, I begged of him not to do it, for I ≈øaid if he did, the ≈øoldiers would certainly fire: he ≈øaid, he would not, and did not. I then ≈øaw a white club thrown at ≈øome di≈øtance from me towards the ≈øoldier's; immediately I heard the word pre≈øent, I ≈øtooped down, a little ≈øpace of time en≈øued, I heard damn you fire: two guns were di≈øcharged then as I judged.</p>

               <p>About ten yards off.

               <p>Not ≈øo as to know them again.

I turned round and ≈øaw a party of ≈øoldiers coming down, I a≈øked one the rea≈øon of his pu≈øhing at me? he dumn'd my blood, and bid me ≈øtand out of their way, I ≈øaid I would not, I was doing no harm to any man, and would not ≈øtand a≈øide for any one; they pa≈ø≈øed me ≈øome on one ≈øide, ≈øome on the other.

               <p>On the evening of the 5th <hi>March,</hi> a little after nine, I was ≈øitting in my hou≈øe, I heard a con≈øiderable noi≈øe in the ≈øtreet, I li≈øtened a little, and found it continued, I went to the door, I found the chief of the noi≈øe was at the bottom of the ≈øtreet, I enquired the rea≈øon, I was told the ≈øoldiers and inhabitants were fighting; I waited at the door a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute or two, people were running down in two's and three's at a time, at length the noi≈øe ≈øub≈øided, and ≈øeemed to be down by <hi>Dock-≈øquare</hi>; I heard the bells ring and heard the cry of fire, I a≈øked where it was? I was an≈øwered there was none, but the inhabitants and ≈øoldiers fighting. Deacon <hi>Mar≈øh</hi> came out, and there came a party of ≈øoldiers from the ≈øouthward, ten or twelve I think, they had ≈øhort cloths I think, I ≈øaw ≈øome white ≈ølieves among≈øt them with bayo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets in their hands, but I apprehended no danger from them; I ≈øtood on the ≈øtep of the door, they appeared to be pu≈øhing right down the ≈øtreet, when they got a few rods from the door, their cour≈øe began to bend towards us, ≈øtill I apprehended nothing but that they were coming to walk on the ≈øide of the way, then they lifted up their weapons, and I began to apprehend danger, they ≈øaid ≈øomething. I do not know what it was, but I went in as fall as I could, and ≈øhut the door immediately. They were within half a foot of it, had it been open a ≈øecond longer they would have had the command of the door, but I was too quick for them and bolted my door, went up chamber, looked out of my window, and ≈øaw people flying here and

there like pidgeons, and the ≈øoldiers running about like mad men in a fury till they got to the bottom of the ≈øtreet.</p>

               <p>I was at Col <hi>Jack≈øon</hi>'s a few minutes after nine on the 5th of <hi>March.</hi> When I came out into <hi>Dock ≈øquare,</hi> the ≈øquare was entirely quiet, I ≈øaw no per≈øons in the whole ≈øquare. I came up <hi>Royal exchange-lane,</hi> I ≈øaw nobody there. I ≈øaw the Sentry at the head of it in peace and quietne≈øs, nobody trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling him: I never ≈øaw <hi>King-≈øtreet</hi> more quiet in my life. I went into my hou≈øe, where was a kin≈øman of mine; I a≈øked him how he did, and while I was ≈øpeaking the young man in the ≈øhop knocked for me, I went into the ≈øhop, and in a half a minute, I heard the cry of murder once or twice; there is mi≈øchief ≈øaid I, at a di≈øtance, ≈øo there is ≈øaid he; I opened the front door to ≈øee, I ≈øaw nobody. I heard a ≈øad noi≈øe, which ≈øeemed to come from <hi>Rowe</hi>'s bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racks. I ≈øtopped a little ≈øpace, and the fir≈øt I ≈øaw enter <hi>King-≈øtreet,</hi> was a party from the <hi>Main-Guard,</hi> ten or twelve came ru≈øhing out violently, I ≈øaw their arms glitter by the moon light, hallowing damn them where are they, by Je≈øus let them come.

the ≈øame expre≈ø≈øions as the afore≈øaid party, and hallowed fire. They pa≈ø≈øed over the way, and the ≈øhade of the moon light hindered me to ≈øee if they went down <hi>Royal-exchange-lane</hi> or went up towards the <hi>Town-hou≈øe</hi> Something ≈øtrikes my mind, I am not po≈øitive now, but I think it was that night, there were a few boys round the Sentry. I went and ≈øaid, boys you have no bu≈øine≈øs with the Sentry, go off, and they went off. I have often ≈øeen boys with the Sentry, and heard words often. The bells were then ringing, and the people began to collect as they do at the cry of fire, and I began to think it was fire. I had a mind to get my ≈øtaff and go out, but I had a reluctance, becau≈øe I had been warned not to go out that night: but while the people were collecting, I came to the door, and ≈øaw them gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thick from all quarters, forty, fifty or ≈øixty. When the party came down, I thought it was no more than I had ≈øeen every day, I thought they had come to relieve the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, they ≈øeemed to be in a po≈øture of defence, and came through the people. I ≈øaw no oppo≈øition. When they came up, they pa≈ø≈øed out of the moon light into the dark, ≈øo that I could not ≈øee them, but I wondered to find them tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ≈øo long. I heard a gun go off, I thought it was an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, but in a little time another gun went off, and a third and fourth, pretty quick, and then the fifth. There ≈øeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a ≈ømall ≈øtop in their firing, I than had no concern, but before the ≈ømoke was well away, I ≈øaw the people dead on the ground. I ≈øaw no oppo≈øition when they were drawn up, the people were not near them; what oppo≈øiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might be at the lane I could not perceive, becau≈øe the box covered that from my view.</p>

went up the <hi>Cu≈øtom-hou≈øe</hi> ≈øteps and knocked at the door; a per≈øon within opened it and ≈øaid ≈øomething, but what, the witne≈øs did not hear; upon that the Sentinel turned round, and pointed his piece at the people oppo≈øite to him. <hi>Langford</hi> ≈øpoke again, and told him there was no danger, the boys would not hurt him, and he ≈øhouldered. The witne≈øs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued talking with the Sentry till the party came down, and then he went into the ≈øtreet. About this time <hi>Gray,</hi> one of the unhappy ≈øufferers, came and clapped <hi>Langford</hi> on the ≈øhoulder, ≈øaying what's here to pay? <hi>Langford</hi> replies, I do not know, but ≈øomething I believe will come of it by and by; his ≈øtand was half way as he ≈øaid betwixt the Sentry-box and <hi>Royal exchange-lane</hi>; the box being on the right corner of the lane, and he oppo≈øite the center of the lane; the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and <hi>Gray</hi> were ≈øtanding together talking familiarly, <hi>Langford</hi> leaning on his ≈øtick, and <hi>Gray</hi> ≈øtanding with his hands folded in his bo≈øom, without a ≈øtick in his hand, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øaying or doing any thing to the ≈øoldiers You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but recollect Gentlemen, that this witne≈øs was expre≈øsly and repeatedly a≈øked, if <hi>Gray</hi> had a ≈øtick, or ≈øaid any thing to the ≈øoldiers? he as often an≈øwered no. <hi>Langford</hi> ≈øpoke to <hi>Killroy,</hi> and after two guns were di≈øcharged, ≈øeeing him pre≈øent his piece, ≈øaid to him, damn you are you going to fire? Pre≈øently upon this, <hi>Killroy</hi> levelled his piece, and firing directly at <hi>Gray,</hi> killed him dead on the ≈øpot!

                        <p>It could not be thought, at the di≈øtance the witne≈øs and <hi>Gray</hi> were ≈øtanding from him, without offering any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, but <hi>Killroy</hi> the pri≈øoner ≈øaw them di≈øtinctly, and ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to de≈øtroy them; if you compare this te≈øtimony with Mr. <hi>Hemmingway</hi>'s who ≈øwears to <hi>Killroy</hi>'s uttering expre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øious importing, that he would mi≈øs no opportunity of fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the inhabitants, he had wi≈øhed for it ever ≈øince he landed, you certainly Gentlemen can have no doubt in your minds but that he had that intention at heart, and took this opportunity to execute it.</p>

<q>Some have been led into mi≈øtake by not well con≈øidering what the pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of malice is; they have con≈øtrued it to be a rancour of mind lodged in the per≈øon killing, for ≈øome con≈øiderable time before the commi≈ø≈øion of the fact, which is a mi≈øtake ari≈øing from their not well di≈øtingui≈øhing between <hi>hatred</hi> and <hi>malice,</hi>

                        <p>Though Gentlemen, it happens on a ≈øudden occa≈øion as this was, if the act is in it's nature wanton and cruel, the law will pre≈øume it to be malicious, unle≈øs that pre≈øumption is taken off by contrary evidence.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ferriter,</hi> who te≈øtified to the ≈øame per≈øon, tells you, he was remarkably active at the Rope walks among≈øt the re≈øt of the ≈øoldiers; taking therefore all the circum≈øtances of this te≈øtimony together, it mu≈øt remove every ≈øort of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in your minds as to the purpo≈øe <hi>Killroy</hi> had at that time; it ≈øeems apparent that there were ≈øtrong marks of malice in his heart; the per≈øon you can have no doubt of, the fact you can have no doubt of, nor can you I think doubt of the ≈øpecies of crime.</p>

party, the Sentinel at this time had his gun brea≈øt high; that while the witne≈øs was ≈øpeaking to <hi>Monk,</hi> (a young lad who was wounded) he lo≈øt ≈øight of <hi>Pre≈øton</hi> and the guns went off: <hi>Monk</hi> complained of being ≈øhot, but <hi>Brewer</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended it was nothing but powder, and that he was more frightened than hurt; the firing began at the right and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the corner man on the left. <hi>Killroy</hi> attacked this witne≈øs in the ≈øame manner <hi>M'Cauley</hi> did <hi>Au≈øtin,</hi> by pu≈øhing at him with his bayonet; a number were collected by the ringing of the bells, but he heard nothing particular in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to abu≈øive language; he ≈øaw no ≈ønow balls thrown, and when the ≈øoldiers came down, he heard ≈øome of the people crying fire, and that was the general cry; ≈øome crying fire becau≈øe the bells rung, ≈øome, no doubt fire, to the ≈øoldiers, daring them to it; but of this no great can be made in the pre≈øent ca≈øe.

draw his ≈øword and march down with them; at that time there were about thirty or forty people in <hi>King ≈øtreet</hi>; he went a little lower, and turned back again round the north ≈øide of the <hi>Town hou≈øe,</hi> and placed him≈øelf at the <hi>Royal-exchange-tavern</hi>; and the party was formed when he got there: he tells you he was not at all apprehen≈øive of danger, con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently he was capable of making ob≈øervations, and placed him≈øelf in ≈øuch a ≈øituation as to do it<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> the party formed in a circle, and he ≈øtood about four or five minutes, before he heard the word given to fire: that he heard it twice: on the fir≈øt command they did not fire; it was repeated, and then the guns went off one after another, like the ≈øtriking of a clock, he was about two yards from them and thinks the firing began at the right.

                        <p>But Gentlemen, as it does not immediately relate to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoners, all the u≈øe I mean to make of it is, to ≈øhow you that from the conduct and appearance of the ≈øoldiery, in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent parts of the town, the inhabitants had rea≈øon to be apprehen≈øive they were in danger of their lives; children and parents, hu≈øbands and wives, ma≈øters and ≈øervants, had rea≈øon to tremble one for another. This apprehen≈øion, together with the ringing of the bells, collected numbers of people in different quarters, as is commonly the ca≈øe when there is any appearance of fire; and the center of the town, when there is a doubt where fire is, becomes naturally the place of rendezvouz: this accounts for the number of people that were there, and for ≈øome having ≈øticks and canes. I mention this only to take off the force of any evidence or pretence that may be made, that there was an intention of the people to a≈ø≈øault, or as it has been expre≈ø≈øed, ≈øwallow up the ≈øoldiers.</p>
                        <p>I have now gone through the evidence on the part of the Crown, in ≈øupport of the charge again≈øt the pri≈øoners, I ≈øhall make a very few ob≈øervations, and leave it with the pri≈øoners and their Council to make their defence, and Mr. <hi>Paine</hi> who is on the ≈øide of the Crown with me, to clo≈øe the cau≈øe.</p>
                        <p>I think Gentlemen upon the whole evidence, you can, in the fir≈øt place, have no doubt but that all the pri≈øoners at the bar were of that party of ≈øoldiers, headed by Capt. <hi>Pre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> who went down to the <hi>Cu≈øtom-Hou≈øe,</hi> on the 5th. <hi>March,</hi> the evening mentioned in the indictments; that the five per≈øons named in tho≈øe indictments were killed by ≈øome or other of that party, but who they were that killed tho≈øe ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral per≈øons, may not be preci≈øely a≈øcertained, except in the ca≈øe of <hi>Killroy,</hi> again≈øt whom I think you have certain evidence.</p>
                        <p>It is a rule of law Gentlemen, when the fact of killing is
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:011683_0035_0F87C8475D1CBA70"/>
once proved, every circum≈øtance alleviating, excu≈øing, or ju≈øtifying, in order to extenuate the crime mu≈øt be proved by the pri≈øoners, for the law pre≈øumes the fact malicious, untill the contrary appears in evidence.</p>
                        <p>There is another rule I ≈øhall mention al≈øo, and that is, that it is imaterial, where there are a number of per≈øons concerned, who gave the mortal blow, all that are pre≈øent, are in the eye of the law, principals. This is a rule ≈øettled by the Judges of <hi>England</hi> upon ≈øolid argument. The que≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therefore then will be, what ≈øpecies of homicide this is? and the deci≈øion of that que≈øtion mu≈øt be deferred, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the defence comes out by the evidence on the other ≈øide</p>
                        <p>The laws of ≈øociety, Gentlemen, lay a re≈øtraint on the pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions of men, that no man ≈øhall be the avenger of his own cau≈øe, unle≈øs through ab≈øolute nece≈ø≈øity, the law giving a remedy for every wrong: If a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        <p>Before we enter upon the≈øe enquiries, permit me, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, to remind you of the importance of this trial, as it relates to the pri≈øoners ‚ÄîIt is for their lives! If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øider the number of per≈øons now on trial, joined with many other circum≈øtances which might be mentioned, it is by far the mo≈øt important, this country ever ≈øaw.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="70" facs="unknown:011683_0036_0F87C84980F5D598"/>Remember the ties you are under to the pri≈øoners and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to your≈øelves: The eyes of all are upon you. Patience in hearing this cau≈øe is an e≈ø≈øential requi≈øite; candor and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are no le≈øs e≈ø≈øential. It is tedious and painful to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ≈øo lengthy a trial; but remember the time which has been taken up by the Crown, in the opening. By every bond of humanity and ju≈øtice, we claim an equal indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence: pay, it is of high importance to your country, that nothing ≈øhould appear on this trial to impeach our ju≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, or ≈øtain our humanity.</p>
                        <p>And here, let me remind you of a notion, which has certainly been too prevalent, and guard you again≈øt it's baneful influence. An opinion has been entertained by many among us, that the life of <hi>a ≈øoldier,</hi> was of very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle value: of much le≈øs value, than others of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.‚ÄîThe law Gentlemen, knows no ≈øuch di≈øtinction;‚Äî the life of a ≈øoldier is viewed by the equal eye of the law, as e≈øtimable, as the life of any other citizen.</p>
                        <p>I cannot any other way account, for what I mention, but by ≈øuppo≈øing, that the indigence and poverty of a ≈øoldier,‚Äî the toils of his life,‚Äîthe ≈øeverity of di≈øcipline to which he is expo≈øed,‚Äîthe precarious tenure by which he is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thought to hold his life, in the ≈øummary deci≈øions of a court-martial, have con≈øpired to propagate a ≈øentiment of this kind; but a little attention to the human heart, will di≈ø≈øipate this notion.</p>
                        <p>The ≈øoldier takes his choice, like all others, of his cour≈øe of life:‚Äîhe has an equal right, with you or me, ≈øo to do. It is be≈øt we ≈øhould not all think alike. Habit makes all things agreeable. What at fir≈øt was irk≈øome, ≈øoon becomes plea≈øing. But does experience teach, that mi≈øery begen in general an hatred of life. By no means; we all reluct at death;‚Äîwe long for one ≈øhort ≈øpace more‚Äîwe gra≈øp, with anxions ≈øolicitude, even after a wretched exi≈øtence. GOD and Nature has implanted this love of life.‚ÄîExpel therefore from your brea≈øts, an opinion ≈øo unwarrantable by any law, human or divine; let not any thing ≈øo injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the pri≈øoners, who value life as much as you; let not any thing ≈øo repugnant to all ju≈øtice have an influence is this trial. The reputation of the country depends much on your conduct, Gentlemen, and, may I not add, Ju≈øtice calls aloud for candour in hearing, and impartiality in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding this cau≈øe, which has, perhaps, too much engro≈ø≈øed
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:011683_0036_0F87C84980F5D598"/>
our affections‚Äîand, I ≈øpeak for one, too much excited our pa≈ø≈øions.</p>
                        <p>The law, by which the pri≈øoners are to be tried, is a law of mercy‚Äîa law applying to us all‚Äîa law, judge <hi>Black≈øtone</hi> will tell us
<q>founded in principles, that are perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, <hi>uniform</hi> and <hi>univer≈øal,</hi> always <hi>conformable</hi> to the feelings of <hi>humanity</hi> and the indelible rights of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</q>

                        <p>How ought we all, who are to bear a part in this day, to aim at a ≈øtrick adherence to the principles of this law‚Äîhow ought we all to aim at utterly eradicating every undue bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a≈øs of the judgment‚Äîa bias ≈øubver≈øive of all ju≈øtice and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.</p>
                        <p>Another opinion equally foreign to truth and law has been adopted by many.</p>
                        <p>It has been thought, that no po≈ø≈øible ca≈øe could happen, in which a ≈øoldier could fire, without the aid of a civil magi≈øtrate. This is a great mi≈øtake‚Äîa very unhappy mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take indeed!‚Äîone, I am afraid, that had it's influence, on the fatal night, which we all lament. The law, <hi>as to the pre≈øent point,</hi> puts the citizen and ≈øoldier under <hi>equal</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtraint. What will ju≈øtify and mitigate the action or the one, will do the ≈øame to the other.‚Äî Let us bear this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variable in mind, in examining the evidence. But before we proceed to this examination, let us take a tran≈øient view of ≈øome occurences, proceding and ≈øub≈øequent to the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly fifth of <hi>March.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>About ≈øome five or ≈øix years ago, it is well known, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain mea≈øures were adopted by the <hi>Briti≈øh</hi> parliament, which gave a general alarm to this continent. Mea≈øures were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately taken, in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> that awakened jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo≈øy, re≈øentment, fortitude and vigilance.‚ÄîAffairs continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed long ≈øtactuating. A ≈øentiment univer≈øal prevailed, that our deare≈øt rights were invaded. It is not our bu≈øine≈øs here to enquire touching the≈øe delicate points. The≈øe are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments, which however intere≈øting or important in them≈øelves, we mu≈øt keep far away from us, when in a Court of law. It poi≈øons ju≈øtice, when politics tinctures it's current.</p>
                        <p>I need not inform you, how the tide ro≈øe, as we were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing towards the pre≈øent times. The general atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion became more and more rou≈øed people became more a like in opinion and practice. A va≈øt majority thought all

                        <p>The cau≈øes of grievance being thus ≈øpread far and wide, the inhabitants viewed the ≈øoldiery as called in, foreign from their prime in≈øtitution, to force obedience to acts, which were, in general, deemed ≈øubver≈øive of natural, as well as con≈øtitutional freedom. With regard to the univer≈øal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence of ideas of this kind, it does not fall within our pre≈øent plan, to give you direct, po≈øitive evidence. It would be too foreign to the pre≈øent i≈ø≈øue, though pertinent enough, when con≈øidered as a clue to ≈øprings and motives of action, and as an additional aid to form a ju≈øt judgement in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent enquiry. You Gentlemen who come from the body of the county, are pre≈øumed to know the≈øe facts, if they are true; nay their notoriety mu≈øt be ≈øuch, provided I am not mi≈øtaken in my conjecture, that the ju≈øtice of my ob≈øerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on this matter, mu≈øt be certainly confirmed by your own experience. I pre≈øume not in this, or any other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact, to pre≈øcribe to you; if the≈øe ≈øentiments are wrong, they ought to have no influence; if right, they ought certainly to have their due weight.</p>
                        <p>I ≈øay, Gentlemen, and appeal to you for the truth of what I ≈øay, that many on this continent viewed their chains as already forged, they ≈øaw fetters as prepared, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the ≈øoldiers as fa≈øtening, and riveting for ages, the ≈øhackles of their bondage.

Di≈øcontent was ≈øeated on almo≈øt every brow.

                        <p>There are an order of men in every commonwealth who never rea≈øon, but always act from feelings. That their rights and liberties were filched away one after another, they had often been told. They had been taught, by tho≈øe whom they believed, that the ax was now laid to the root of the tree, and one more ≈øtroke compleated it's fall. It was in vain to expect to ≈øilence or ≈øubdue the≈øe emotions by rea≈øons, ≈øoothings, or dangers. A belief, that nothing

could be wor≈øe than the calamities which ≈øeemed inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, had extended it≈øelf on all ≈øides, and arguments drawn from ≈øuch ≈øources had little influence. Each day gave ri≈øe to now occurrences which encrea≈øed animo≈øities. Heart-burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, heats and bickerings became more and more exten≈øive. Reciprocal in≈øults lowered the temper, mutual injuries im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bittered the pa≈ø≈øions.</p>
                        <p>Can we wonder, that when every thing tended to ≈øome important action, the period ≈øo ≈øoon arrived?

The <hi>con≈øtitutional</hi> legality, the propriety, the expediency of their appointment are que≈øtions of ≈øtate, not to be determined, nor even agitated by us, in this Court. It is enough for us, if the law takes notice of them when thus ≈øtationed; if it warrants their continuance; If it protects them in their quarters. They were ≈øent here by that authority, which our laws know; they were quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here, as I take it, agreeable to an act of the Briti≈øh Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; they were ordered here, by your Sovereign, and mine.

                        <p>Con≈øider, Gentlemen, the danger which you, and all of us are in, of being led away by our affections and attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.‚ÄîWe have ≈øeen the blood of our fellow men flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ≈øtreets. We have been told that this blood was <hi>wrongfully</hi> ≈øhed. That is now the point in i≈ø≈øue. But let it be borne deep upon our minds, that the pri≈øoners are to be condemned by the evidence <hi>here in Court</hi> produced again≈øt them, and by nothing el≈øe. Matters heard or ≈øeen abroad, are to have no weight: in general they undermine the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of ju≈øtice and truth. It has been our misfortune, that a ≈øy≈øtem of evidence has appeared in the world again≈øt us. It is not our bu≈øine≈øs to blame any one for this. It is our misfortune, I ≈øay. It ≈øhould be remembered, that we were not pre≈øent to cro≈øs examine: and the danger which re≈øults from having this publication in the hands of tho≈øe who are to pa≈øs upon our lives, ought to be guarded again≈øt. We ≈øay we are innocent, by our plea, and are not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced guilty upon a new ≈øpecies of evidence, unknown in the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> ≈øy≈øtem of criminal law.</p>
                        <p>But as though a ≈øeries of <hi>ex parte</hi> evidence was not enough, all the colours of the canva≈øs have been touched in order to fre≈øhen the wounds, and by a tran≈øport of imagination, we are made pre≈øent at the ≈øcene of action. The prints ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in our hou≈øes have added wings to fancy, and in the fervour of our zeal, rea≈øon is in hazard of being lo≈øt. For as was elegantly expre≈ø≈øed, by a learned Gentleman at the late trial, "The pa≈ø≈øions of man, nay his very imaginations are contagious." The pomp of funeral, the horrors of death have been ≈øo delineated, as to give a ≈øpring to our ideas, and in≈øpire a glow incompatible with ≈øound, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berative judgment. In this ≈øituation, every pa≈ø≈øion has alternately been predominant. They have each in it's turn, ≈øub≈øided, in degree, and they have ≈øometimes given place to de≈øpondence, grief and ≈øorrow. How careful ≈øhould

we be, that we do not mi≈øtake the impre≈ø≈øions of gloom and melancholy, for the dictates of rea≈øon and truth. How careful, le≈øt borne away by a torrent of pa≈ø≈øion, we make ≈øhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck of con≈øcience.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps, you may be told.

                        <p>The≈øe witne≈ø≈øes, (who≈øe te≈øtimony I ≈øhall not con≈øider in the order they were produced) inform you, that in the former part of the evening a number of ≈øoldiers ru≈øhed from ≈øome of the lanes near the <hi>Guard hou≈øe,</hi> or as Col. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhall</hi> ≈øuppo≈øes, from the <hi>Guard hou≈øe</hi> it≈øelf.

                        <p>The cry was "where are they‚Äîdamn them where are they!"

and other parts of it may ≈øtand in a very different light. But we are ready to admit, that their behaviour was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unju≈øtifiable‚Äîfor we don't look upon our≈øelves as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way concerned in their conduct.‚ÄîConduct which, if ≈øome of the witne≈ø≈øes are not mi≈øtaken, ≈øeems more like that of madmen and barbarians, than like rea≈øonable creatures.

                        <p>‚òû Mr. <hi>Jo≈øiah Quincy</hi> then proceeded to a minute detail of the crown evidence, pointing out, as he went along, tho≈øe circum≈øtances that favoured the pri≈øoners; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting chiefly on tho≈øe facts, which ≈øerved to refute or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validate the po≈øitions of the Council for the Crown; by ≈øhowing an a≈ø≈øult and attack upon <hi>the Sentry.</hi> He then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewed tho≈øe parts of the evidence, which had a tendency either to prove in≈øult, abu≈øe, or a≈ø≈øault and battery of <hi>the party</hi>: he pointed out the various quarters, from which all the≈øe, but e≈øpecially the a≈ø≈øault and battery proceeded: and from the facts, time and circum≈øtances te≈øtified, inferred the attack to have been on various ≈øides at the ≈øame in≈øtant. From the noi≈øes, violence and rattling of the guns he drew other con≈øequences u≈øeful to his cau≈øe. From the inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ≈øome, and the forgetfulne≈øs of others; from the tumult, fright, confu≈øion and pa≈ø≈øions in the ≈øcene, he made ≈øuch deductions as might account for the contrariety and ≈øeeming incompatibility of the evidence.</p>
                        <p>He next very particularly ≈øtated the Evidence for the pri≈øoners, as he had been in≈øtructed it would turn out on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination; and as he opened his evidence, he carefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked its conformity to, and connection with, many parts of that already exhibited by the Council for the King.‚Äî He then called the witne≈ø≈øes, who ≈øwore as follow.]</p>

               <p>On the evening of the 5th of <hi>March</hi> I was at Mr. <hi>Mar≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons,</hi> ≈øeveral of us were ≈øtanding by the fire: we heard the cry of fire, ≈øome ≈øaid we will go out and ≈øee where the fire is. I went and I ≈øaw ≈øeveral people running to and fro, I a≈øked what the matter was, they ≈øaid a ≈øoldier had killed a boy. I was an≈øwered in that manner by another; ≈øome people ≈øaid we will go back again and get our ≈øticks: I did not ≈øee any number of people, but a few running up to <hi>King-≈øtreet,</hi> one of them ≈øtruck the ground with his ≈øtick and ≈øhivered it. I then went into <hi>King ≈øtreet</hi> and was coming away again, when I heard a huzza and a number of feet behind me, and I ≈øtood to let them pa≈øs; there might be about ninety; they run up <hi>King-≈øtreet</hi> huzzaing. I walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after them, when they came oppo≈øite the <hi>Cu≈øtom hou≈øe,</hi> they ≈øtopped, and ≈øome ≈øaid that is the fellow that u≈øed the inhabitants ill; another contradicted them and ≈øaid it was

not him; upon that the people encroached on the Sentinel; I was in the mid≈øt of the people, and he retreated back and they went forward, at la≈øt I ≈øaw him go on the ≈øteps of the <hi>Cu≈øtom hou≈øe,</hi> and they went clo≈øer, and he ≈øet his back to the door and loaded. I heard the ball go down di≈øtinctly.</p>

               <p>The generality of them were young men. He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øented his gun, and ≈øaid keep of or I will fire upon you; the reply was, fire, God damn you fire, fire and be damn'd. I went about fifteen yards below, there was a man ≈øtanding by me, he had the butt end of a bat in his hand, and ≈øaid he would throw it at the Sentinel, I ≈øaid do not, for he will fire at whatever place it comes from. Whether he threw it or not I do not know, for I left him and went to Mr. <hi>Sherwin's</hi> door. I was ≈øaying it was imprudent to attack a Sentinel on his po≈øt, ≈øomebody ≈øaid he was di≈øarmed; I thought ≈øo too, for I ≈øaw the glittering of arms; I walked to the <hi>Cu≈øtom hou≈øe</hi> ≈øteps, curio≈øity led me to ≈øee if they were ≈øo prudent as to fa≈øten the <hi>Cu≈øtom-hou≈øe</hi> door; I tryed the latch, and it was fa≈øt; a fellow ≈øaid to one of the ≈øoldiers, damn you why do you turn your bayonet this way, turn it the other way. I thought I was not ≈øafe there, but went to my old place, and ≈øtood there a few minutes; I thought I heard two guns cock, immediately I heard one go off, ≈øoon after another, and I think four more. I think ≈øix in all. The people ≈øaid where I was ≈øtanding, they fired nothing but powder. I thought to go up to an acquaintance's hou≈øe, and went in the middle of the ≈øtreet, and coming oppo≈øite to the ≈øoldiers, I ≈øaw two men lay, one on the right and one on the left, on their backs; I concluded they were dead.</p>

               <p>Do you know any thing of the proceedings at <hi>Murray</hi>'s barracks on the evening of the 5th <hi>March</hi> la≈øt, previous to the firing in <hi>King-≈øtreet.</hi>

               <p>I live oppo≈øite the barrack-hou≈øe, and was at home that evening. A little after eight I heard a noi≈øe and di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance in the ≈øtreet, I went out to know what it was, and was told there was a difference between the towns people and ≈øoldiers. I ≈øaw ≈øeveral ≈øoldiers pa≈øs and repa≈øs, ≈øome with bayonets, ≈øome with clubs and one thing and another. I ≈øtood at my own door; I ob≈øerved the noi≈øe ≈øeemed to come from towards the market; I ≈øaw a number of people running to and fro acro≈øs the bottom of the ≈øtreet. I ≈øhut my door and went in about eight or ten minutes. I heard a noi≈øe like a ≈øingle per≈øon running thro' <hi>Boyl≈øton</hi>'s <hi>alley</hi> with great violence; he ran as I took it towards the barrack gate, and cried out, town born turn out, town born turn out, then turned to the ≈øide of the lane, and ≈øaid town born turn out, town born turn out. I heard this repeated twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or thirty times, I believe, it was the con≈øtant cry. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member after coming out the ≈øecond time, to hear the voice of a per≈øon which I took to be En≈øign <hi>Maul,</hi> ≈øay, who is this fellow, lay hold of him. I did not hear a word pa≈øs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the people that pa≈ø≈øed backwards and forwards, and the Sentinel at the barrack gate, nor from the Sentinel to them; this cry of town born turn out, was repeated for ≈øeven or eight mintes, when I heard the voice of a great many more.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Q</speaker>
               <p>Were they ≈øoldiers?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I do not know, they might be ≈øoldiers; from the fir≈øt of that cry it might be a quarter of an hour or more, they ≈øeemed to retreat and come on again, and ≈øtruck their ≈øticks very hard again≈øt the corner of the hou≈øe. The collection of ≈øuch a number, with the noi≈øe of the clubs, induced me to lock my door, put out my light in the fore part of my hou≈øe, and to go up ≈øtairs into the chamber fronting the barracks; when there, I ob≈øerved four or five officers of the 29th, ≈øtanding on their own ≈øteps, and there might be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt twenty or thirty of the town's people ≈øurrounding the ≈øteps. About that time came a little man, who he was I do not know; he ≈øaid, why do you not keep your ≈øoldiers in their barracks, they ≈øaid they had done every thing they po≈ø≈øibly could, and would do every thing in their power,
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:011683_0048_0F87C858B834AC00"/>
to keep them in their barracks, on which he ≈øaid, are the inhabitants to be knocked down in the ≈øtreet, are they to be murdered in this manner; the officers ≈øtill in≈øi≈øted they had done their utmo≈øt, and would do it, to keep the ≈øoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in their barracks; the ≈øame per≈øon then ≈øaid, you know the country has been u≈øed ill, you know the town has been u≈øed ill, we did not ≈øend for you, we will not have you here, we will get rid of you, or we will drive you away; which of the la≈øt expre≈ø≈øions I cannot ≈øay, but it was one or the other: the officers ≈øtill in≈øi≈øted they had done their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt, and would do it, to keep the ≈øoldiers in their barracks, and begged the per≈øon to u≈øe his intere≈øt to di≈øper≈øe the people, that no mi≈øchief might happen; whether he did addre≈øs the people or not, I cannot ≈øay, for the confu≈øion was ≈øo great I could not di≈øtingui≈øh.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>He was a little man, I think in a ≈øurtout; immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately the cry of home, home, was mentioned; I dont re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect ≈øeeing any per≈øon go away at the fir≈øt cry, and there was ≈øuch confu≈øion I could not tell what was ≈øaid, but in five minutes afterwards the cry home, home, was repeated, on which the greate≈øt part of them, po≈ø≈øibly two thirds, went up <hi>Boyl≈øton</hi>'s <hi>alley</hi> towards the <hi>Town-hou≈øe,</hi> huzzaing for the <hi>Main Guard,</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>A con≈øiderable number. I then ob≈øerved more of the towns people come from towards the <hi>Market</hi>; there was a good deal of ≈øquabble and noi≈øe betwixt the people and the officers, but what was ≈øaid I could not bear. The next thing I recollect in the affair was, a little boy came down the alley, clapping his hand to his head, and cried he was killed, he was killed; on which one of the officers took hold of him, and damned him for a little ra≈øcal, a≈øking him what bu≈øine≈øs he had out of doors; the boy ≈øeemed to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ≈øeven or eight year old. Some little time after that, I ≈øaw a ≈øoldier come out of the barrack gate with his mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, he went directly facing the alley, in the middle of the ≈øtreet, and kneeled down on one knee, and ≈øaid now damn your bloods, I will make a lane through you all; while he was pre≈øenting, Mr. <hi>Maul</hi> an En≈øign, with either Mr. <hi>Dixon</hi> or Mr. <hi>Minchin,</hi> I do not know which, came after him, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately laid hold of him, and took the mu≈øket from him, ≈øhoved him towards the barrack, and I think gave him the
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:011683_0048_0F87C858B834AC00"/>
mu≈øket again, and charged him at his peril to come out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. I do not recollect any di≈øcour≈øe that pa≈ø≈øed between the towns people and officers, there was ≈øtill ≈øuch clamour and confu≈øion, that I could not hear what pa≈ø≈øed; but in a little time either the ≈øoldier who came out before, or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, came out again, he repeated much the ≈øame words as the other, he had his gun in his hand, he did not offer to kneel down, but u≈øed the ≈øame expre≈ø≈øions.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>He was pre≈øenting when Mr. <hi>Maul</hi> knocked him down, took his mu≈økuet from him, drove him into the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racks, and I think the barrack gate was then ≈øhut; about this time I recollect I heard Dr. <hi>Cooper</hi>'s bell ring, I heard ≈øome officer ≈øay, go and ≈øtop that bell from ringing, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any body went or not, I cannot ≈øay, but it did not ring a great while: About this time I ≈øaw Capt. <hi>Goldfinch</hi> of the fourteenth, on the ≈øteps with the officers of the twenty-ninth; there came up another little man, who he was I do not know, but in a much different manner from what the other did.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>He had on a great coat or ≈øurtout of a light brown, he reque≈øted the ≈øoldiers might be kept in their barracks, and that the officers would do every thing in their power to keep them there, the officers ≈øaid, they had, and would do ≈øo; and as the ≈øoldiers were in their barracks, begged the people might go away; this little man ≈øaid to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, gentlemen, you hear what the officers ≈øay, that the ≈øoldiers are all in their barracks, and you had better go home; on which the cry was, home, home, home.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Yes: on which a great many went up the alley a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and I heard the expre≈ø≈øion, Let us go to the <hi>Main-Guard</hi>: Capt. <hi>Goldfinch</hi> was ≈øtill on the ≈øteps, and I heard his voice ≈øtill talking, and I think he de≈øired every per≈øon would go away; while he was talking, I heard the report of a mu≈øket.</p>

               <p>It was not many minutes; in a few ≈øeconds I heard the report of a ≈øecond gun, pre≈øently after that a third; upon the firing of the fir≈øt gun, I heard Capt. <hi>Goldfinch</hi> ≈øay, I thought it would come to this, it is time for me to go.‚Äî I then ≈øaw a ≈øoldier come down the alley from <hi>Cornhill,</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="unknown:011683_0049_0F87C85A9BFB7F78"/>
and went up to the ≈øteps where the officers ≈øtood, and ≈øaid, they fired from or upon the <hi>Main guard.</hi> I then heard the drum at the <hi>Main-Guard</hi> beat to arms, I came down ≈øtairs and did not go out till I was ≈øent for to ≈øome of the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed people.</p>

               <p>The 5th of <hi>March,</hi> about nine in the evening, I was pa≈ø≈øing over <hi>Cornhill,</hi> I ≈øaw a number collected by the pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øage to the barracks, I went towards it and two or three people called me by name, and begged me to endeavour to ≈øend the ≈øoldiers to their barracks, or el≈øe there would be murder, with difficulty I got to the entrance of the pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øage, the people were pelting the ≈øoldiers with ≈ønow-balls, the ≈øoldiers were defending them≈øelves at the entrance.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>No by no means, I think one of them had a fire-≈øho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, as ≈øoon as the ≈øoldiers knew me, they with my per≈øua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion went to the bottom of the pa≈ø≈øage, when I got there,
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:011683_0049_0F87C85A9BFB7F78"/>
I ≈øaw ≈øome officers of the twenty-ninth, I told tho≈øe officers I ≈øu≈øpected there would be a riot, and as I was the olde≈øt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer I ordered the men to the barracks, and they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately confined; the mob followed me and came to the gate of the barracks, and abu≈øed the men very much indeed, with bad language, ≈øo that the men mu≈øt have been enraged very much, but by the vigilence and activity of the officers, the men were kept within bounds; the mob ≈øtill in≈øulted the men, dared them to come out, called them a pack of ≈øcoundrels, that dared not come out to fight them, and it was with difficulty they were kept in their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racks, I never heard ≈øuch abu≈øe in my life, from one man to another.

I thought it nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øtay ≈øome time to a≈ø≈øi≈øt the officers in keeping the men in their barracks, in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after the people had moved off, I heard ≈øome guns fire, and the <hi>Main-Guard</hi> drum beat to arms; I told Mr. <hi>Dixon</hi> it was nece≈ø≈øary for me to move off, to join my own regiment. The ≈øame evening, about half an hour before this affair happened, I was in <hi>King-≈øtreet,</hi> and was acco≈øted by a barber's boy, who ≈øaid, there goes the fellow who hath not paid my ma≈øter for dre≈ø≈øing his hair, fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately for me, I had his receipt in my pocket, the Sentinel ≈øaid, he is a gentleman, and if he owes you any thing he will pay it: I pa≈ø≈øed on without taking any notice of what the boy ≈øaid.</p>

I a≈øked them what had been the matter, they ≈øaid there had been a ≈øquabble by <hi>Murray's</hi> barracks, and they had drove the ≈øoldiers in; they ≈øaid it was all over; then I left Mr. <hi>Bayard</hi> and they all came down into <hi>King-≈øtreet,</hi> and betwixt <hi>Quaker-lane</hi> and <hi>Royal-exchange-lane</hi> they made a ≈øtop, and met in a elu≈øter, and not long afterwards di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per≈øed; I did not leave above twelve or fifteen in <hi>King-≈øtreet,</hi> when I came out of it.

               <p>On the evening of the 5th of <hi>March,</hi> I pa≈ø≈øed my time at the Bunch of Grapes in <hi>King-≈øtreet,</hi> in company with three gentlemen of the town; betwixt the hours of nine and ten we were alarmed with the bells, and a cry of fire, they ≈øaid to me come <hi>Gridley</hi> we had better go and enquire where the fire is, I ≈øaid I had rather ≈øit where I was, there might be ≈øome di≈øturbance, and I did not want to be in it; however, I agreed, and we went. I ≈øaw Mr. <hi>Davis</hi> particularly, he ≈øaid to me what do you make of this, I told him I believed there was no fire, but rather a tumult. I ≈øaid to Mr. <hi>Davis</hi> I will go up the ≈øtreet and ≈øee what the matter is, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again and let him and the re≈øt that were on the ≈øteps of the door know what the matter was.

               <p>He was retreating towards the ≈øteps with his bayonet charged. I then found the <hi>Main-guard</hi> to be in confu≈øion.

               <p>No, it was general, they joined in with one another as they met.

I proceeded down ≈øtreet on the <hi>Cu≈øtom hou≈øe</hi> ≈øide, on the flat ≈øtones; the ≈øoldiers were drawn up in two ranks front and rear, as I thought it, they had not had time to form as I came down; I walked betwixt the two ranks, they were then loading their pieces.</p>

I was called that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening about eleven o'clock to him, I was engaged with Mr. <hi>Paine</hi> and could not go; next morning I went; after dre≈ø≈øing his wounds, I advi≈øed him never to go again into quarrels and riots; He ≈øaid he was very ≈øorry he did go.‚Äî Dr. <hi>Lloyd</hi> who was pre≈øent, turned round to me and ≈øaid, <hi>Jeffries,</hi> I believe this man will be able to tell us how the affair was, we had better a≈øk him: I a≈øked him then how long he had been in <hi>King-≈øtreet</hi> when they fired? He ≈øaid he went from Mr. <hi>Field</hi>'s when the bells rung, when he got to <hi>Walker</hi>'s corner, he ≈øaw many per≈øons coming from <hi>Cornhill,</hi> who he was told had been quarreling with the ≈øoldiers down there, that he went with them as far as the ≈øtocks, that he ≈øtopped there, but they pa≈ø≈øed on: While he was ≈øtanding there he ≈øaw many things thrown at the Sentry. I a≈øked him if he knew what was thrown? He ≈øaid he heard the things ≈øtrike again≈øt the guns, and they ≈øounded hard, he believed they were oy≈øter ≈øhells and ice; he heard the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple huzza every time they heard any thing ≈øtrike that ≈øound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hard: that he then ≈øaw ≈øome ≈øoldiers going down to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Cu≈øtom-hou≈øe,</hi> that he ≈øaw the people pelt them as they went along, after they had got down there, the cro≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over towards <hi>Warden</hi> and <hi>Vernon</hi>'s ≈øhop, in order to ≈øet what they would do, that as he was pa≈ø≈øing he was ≈øhot,‚Äî that he was taken up and carried home to Mr. <hi>Field</hi>'s by ≈øome of his friends. I a≈øked him whether he thought the ≈øoldiers would fire? He told me he thought the ≈øoldiers would have fired long before. I then a≈øked him whether he thought the ≈øoldiers were abu≈øed a great deal, after they went down there? He ≈øaid, he thought they were. I a≈øk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him whether he thought the ≈øoldiers would have been

hurt, if they had not fired? He ≈øaid, he really thought they would, for he heard many voices cry out, kill them. I a≈øked him then, meaning to clo≈øe all, whether he thought they fired in ≈øelf defence, or on purpo≈øe to de≈øtroy the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? He ≈øaid, he really thought they did fire to defend them≈øelves; that he did not blame the man whoever he was, that ≈øhot him. This conver≈øation was on <hi>Wedne≈øday.</hi> He always gave the ≈øame an≈øwers to the ≈øame que≈øtions, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very time I vi≈øited him.</p>

               <p>He was told of it.

What more natural ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition, than to ≈øuppo≈øe many an hone≈øt mind might at this time fluctuate thus.‚ÄîThe ≈øoldiers are here‚Äîwe wi≈øh them away: we did not ≈øend for them‚Äîthey have cut and wounded the peaceable inhabitants, and it may be my turn next. At this in≈øtant of time, he has a fre≈øh detail of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries‚Äîre≈øentment redoubles every ≈øucce≈ø≈øive moment‚Äîhuz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za! for the <hi>Main-guard</hi>: we are in a moment before the <hi>Cu≈øtom-Hou≈øe.</hi> No time is given for recollection. We find, from the king's evidence, and from our own, the cry was "Here is a ≈øoldier!" Not here is <hi>the ≈øoldier</hi> who has injured us‚Äîhere is the fellow who wounded the man in <hi>Cornihll.</hi> No, the rea≈øoning or rather ferment ≈øeems to be, the ≈øoldiers have committed an outrage, we have an equal right to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict puni≈øhment‚Äîor rather revenge, which they had to make an a≈ø≈øault.‚ÄîThey ≈øaid right, but never con≈øidered, that, <hi>tho≈øe</hi> ≈øoldiers had <hi>no right</hi> at all. The≈øe are ≈øenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments natural enough to per≈øons in this ≈øtate of mind‚Äîwe can ea≈øily ≈øuppo≈øe even good men thinking and acting thus. Very ≈øimilar to this is the force of Dr. <hi>Hirons</hi>'s te≈øtimony, and ≈øome others. But our enquiry is‚ÄîWhat ≈øays the law? We mu≈øt calmly enquire, whether this, or any thing like it, is countenanced by the law. What is <hi>natural</hi> to <hi>the man,</hi> what are his feelings are one thing: what is the <hi>duty</hi> of the <hi>citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen</hi> is quite another. Rea≈øon mu≈øt re≈øume her ≈øeat‚Äîand then we ≈øhall hear, and obey the voice of the law.</p>
                        <p>The law indulges no man in being his own avenger.‚Äî Early, in the hi≈øtory of juri≈øprudence, we find the ≈øword taken from the party injured, and put into the hands of the magi≈øtrate. Were not this the ca≈øe, puni≈øhment would know no bounds in extent or duration. Be≈øides, it ≈øaps the very root of di≈øtributive ju≈øtice, when any individual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades the prerogative of law, and ≈ønatches from the civil magi≈øtrate the balance and the rod. How much more are the

pillars of ≈øecurity ≈øhaken, when a mixt body, a≈ø≈øembled as tho≈øe in <hi>King-≈øtreet,</hi> a≈ø≈øume the province of ju≈øtice, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the rights of the citizen? For it mu≈øt not be forgot, that the ≈øoldier is a citizen, equally intitled with us all to protection and ≈øecurity. Hence all are alike obliged to pay obedience to the law: For the price of this protection is that of obedience.</p>
                        <p>Let it not be apprehended, that I am advancing a doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, that a ≈øoldier may attack an inhabitant, and he not allowed to defend him≈øelf. No Gentlemen! if a ≈øoldier ru≈øh violently through the ≈øtreet and pre≈øents a weapon of death, in a ≈øtriking po≈øture; no doubt the per≈øon a≈ø≈øailed may defend him≈øelf, even to taking the life of the a≈ø≈ø<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Revenge and a ≈øen≈øe of ≈øelf pre≈øervation in≈øtantly take po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the per≈øon thus attacked; and the law goes not upon the ab≈øurd ≈øuppo≈øition, that a per≈øon can in the≈øe circum≈øtances, unman him≈øelf. Hence we find a hu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, taking his wife in the act of adultery, in≈øtantly ≈øeizes a deadly weapon and ≈ølays the adulterer;‚Äîit is not murder. Nay a fillip upon the no≈øe or forehead, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, is ≈øuppo≈øed by the law to be ≈øufficient provocation to reduce killing to Man≈ølaughter. It is, therefore, upon prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples like the≈øe, principles, upon which tho≈øe, who now bear the harde≈øt again≈øt us, at other times, ≈øo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend; it is, I ≈øay, upon the right of ≈øelf-defence and ≈øelf-pre≈øervation we rely for our acquittal.</p>
                        <p>Here again it ≈øhould be kept in view, that whenever the party injurying has e≈øcaped by flight, and time ≈øufficient for the pa≈ø≈øions to cool, in judgment of law, hath elap≈øed; however great the injury, the injured party mu≈øt have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe to law for his redre≈øs. Such is the wi≈ødom of the law; of that law, than which we are none of us to pre≈øume our≈øelves wi≈øer;‚Äîof that law, which is ≈øonned in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of ages, and which in conde≈øcen≈øion to the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of fle≈øh and blood (but to nothing el≈øe) extenuates the offence.

            <p>The <hi>words, in≈øult</hi> and <hi>ge≈øtures</hi> of the ≈øame per≈øons were next pointed out: and from thence was collected the de≈øigns of the per≈øons <hi>a≈ø≈øaulting,</hi> and the rea≈øonable apprehen≈øions of tho≈øe <hi>a≈ø≈øaulted.</hi>

                        <p>And here, Gentlemen, let me again inform you, that the law which is to pa≈øs upon the≈øe pri≈øoners, is a law adapting it≈øelf to the human ≈øpeices, with all their feelings, pa≈ø≈øions and infirmities; a law which does not go upon the ab≈øurd ≈øuppo≈øition, that men are ≈øtocks and ≈øtones; or that in the fervour of the blood, a man can act with the diliberation and judgment of a philo≈øopher.

                        <p>Keeping therefore this full in view, let us take once more, a very brief and cur≈øory ≈øurvey of matters ≈øupported by the evidence. And, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Prepare, Gentlemen of the Jury, now to attend to that ≈øpecies of law, which will adapt it≈øelf to this trial, with all its ≈øingular and aggravating circum≈øtances. A law full of benignity, full of compa≈ø≈øion, replete with mercy.</p>
                        <p>And here, Gentlemen, I mu≈øt, agreeable to the method we formerly adopted, fir≈øt tell you by what law the pri≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are <hi>not</hi> to be tried, or condemned. And they mo≈øt certainly are <hi>not</hi> to be tried by the <hi>Mo≈øaic</hi> law: a law, we take it, peculiarly de≈øigned for the government of a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar nation, who being in a great mea≈øure under a theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical form of government, it's in≈øtitutions cannot, with any propriety, be adduced for our regulation in the≈øe days. It is with pain, therefore, I have ob≈øerved any endeavour to mi≈ølead our judgment on this occa≈øion; by drawing our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:011683_0072_0F87C7F1E653CC50"/>
to the precepts delivered in the days of <hi>Mo≈øes;</hi> and by di≈øconnected pa≈ø≈øages of Scriptures, applied in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner foreign to their original de≈øign or import, there ≈øeems to have been an attempt to touch ≈øome peculiar ≈øentiments, which we know are thought to be prevalent; and in this way, we take it, an injury is like to be done, by giving the mind a bia≈øs, it ought never to have received; becau≈øe it is not warranted by our laws.</p>
                        <p>We have heard it publicly ≈øaid of late, oftener, than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
<q>Who≈øoever ≈øhedeth man's blood, by man ≈øhall his blood be ≈øhed.</q>
This is plainly, Gentlemen, a general rule, which, like all others of the kind mu≈øt have its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions. A rule, which if taken in it's ≈øtrict litteral lattitude, would imply, that a man killing another in ≈øelf defence, would incur the pains of death. A doctrine, which no man in his ≈øen≈øes would ever embrace: a doctrine that certainly never prevailed under the <hi>Mo≈øaical</hi> in≈øtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For we find, the <hi>Jews</hi> had their ≈øix cities of refuge, to which the man≈ølayer might flee, from the avenger of blood. And ≈øomething analogous to this, (if it did not originate from it) is our benefit of clergy.</p>
                        <p>And ≈øo, that "the <hi>murderer</hi> ≈øhall flee to the pit" comes under the ≈øame con≈øideration. And when we hear it a≈øked, as it very lately has been, "Who DARE ≈øtay him?" I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer, if the laws of our country ≈øtay him, you ought to do likewi≈øe; and every good ≈øubject <hi>dares</hi> to do what the law allows. But the very po≈øition is <hi>begging the que≈øtion:</hi> for the que≈øtion, now in i≈ø≈øue, is, whether either of the pri≈øoners is <hi>a murderer,</hi> in the ≈øen≈øe of our laws; for you recollect, that what is murder and what not, is <hi>a que≈øtion of law,</hi> ari≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon facts ≈øtated and allowed.</p>
                        <p>But to go on;
<q>You ≈øhall take no ≈øatisfaction for the life of a <hi>murderer,</hi> which is <hi>guilty of death.</hi>
                           </q>
Here again, is a begging the que≈øtion; and moreover the words "<hi>guilty of death,</hi>" if rightly rendered from the original, mu≈øt be one of tho≈øe general rules, I ju≈øt now mentioned; which always have their exceptions. But tho≈øe words ≈øeem to be wrong tran≈ølated; for in the margin of our great bible, we find them rendered "<hi>faulty to die.</hi>" Again≈øt a po≈øition of this kind we have no objection.

                        <p>I have now gone thro' tho≈øe authorities in law, which I thought pertinent to this trial.

                           </gap>ts, but not ≈øo generally known, or attended to, by many, as <hi>it ought to be.</hi> A law which extends to each of us, as well as to any of the pri≈øoners; for it knows <hi>no di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of per≈øons.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And the doctrines which have been thus laid down are for the ≈øafeguard of us all. Doctrines which are founded in the wi≈ødom and policy of ages; which the greate≈øt men, whoever lived, have adopted and contended for. Nay, the matter has been carried, by very wi≈øe men, much further than we have conte≈øted for. And that you may not think the purport of the authorities read, are the rigid notions of a dry ≈øy≈øtem, and the contracted deci≈øions of municipal law, I beg leave to read to you a pa≈ø≈øage from a very great, theortic, writer: a man who≈øe prai≈øes have re≈øounded through all the known world, and probably will, through all ages, who≈øe ≈øentiments are as free air, and who has done as much for learning, liberty, and mankind, as any of the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi>; I mean the ≈øagacious Mr. <hi>Locke</hi>: He will tell you, Gentlemen, in his E≈ø≈øay on Government, p. 2. c. 3. "That <hi>all manner of force without right</hi> puts man in a ≈øtate of <hi>war</hi> with the <hi>aggre≈ø≈øor</hi>; and of con≈øequence, that, being in ≈øuch a ≈øtate of <hi>war,</hi> he may LAWFULLY KILL him, who put him under this <hi>unnatural</hi> re≈øtraint." According to this doctrine, we ≈øhould have nothing to do, but enquire, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther here was "<hi>force without right</hi>:" if ≈øo, we were <hi>in ≈øuch a ≈øtate,</hi> as rendered it LAWFUL TO KILL the aggre≈ø≈øor, who
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:011683_0074_0F87C7F35CE0CAB0"/>
                           <q>put us under ≈øo <hi>unnatural</hi> a <hi>re≈øtraint.</hi> Few, I believe, will ≈øay, after hearing <hi>all</hi> this evidence, that we were under no <hi>unnatural re≈øtraint.</hi>
                           </q>
But we don't want to extend matters ≈øo far. We cite this author to ≈øhow the world, that the greate≈øt friends to their country, to univer≈øal liberty, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable rights of all men, have held tenets, and advanced maxims favourable to the pri≈øoners at the bar. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we ≈øhould not adopt the ≈øentiments of Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> in their mo≈øt exten≈øive latitude, yet there ≈øeems to be ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing very analogous to his opinion, which is countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in our laws.</p>
                        <p>There is a ≈øpirit which pervades the whole ≈øy≈øtem of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øh</hi> juri≈øprudence, which in≈øpires a freedom of thought, ≈øpeech and behaviour. Under a form of government like ours, it would be in vain to expect, that pacific, timid, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequious, and ≈øervile temper, ≈øo predominant in more de≈øpotic governments. From our happy con≈øtitution there re≈øults it's very natural effects‚Äîan impatience of injuries, and a ≈øtrong re≈øentment of in≈øults: (and a very wi≈øe man has ≈øaid, "He who <hi>tamely</hi> beareth in≈øults <hi>inviteth</hi> injuries.") Hence, I take it, that attention to the "feelings of humanity"‚Äî to "humanity and imperfection"‚Äî"the infirmities of fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that attention to
"the indelible rights of mankind;"‚Äîthat lenity to "the pa≈ø≈øions of man;"‚Äî that "benignity and conde≈øcention of the law" ≈øo often repeated in our books.</p>
                        <p>And, indeed, if this were not the ca≈øe, the genius of our civil con≈øtitution and the ≈øpirit of our municipal law would be repugnant:‚Äîthat prime defect in any political ≈øy≈øtem ‚Äîthat grand ≈øoleci≈øm in ≈øtate-policy.</p>

As the pri≈øoners ≈øtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you for their lives, it may be proper, to recollect with what temper the law requires we ≈øhould proceed to this trial. The form of proceeding at their arraignment, has di≈øcovered that the ≈øpirit of the law upon ≈øuch occa≈ø≈øions, is
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:011683_0075_0F87C7F9F3E23230"/>
conformable to humanity, to common ≈øen≈øe and feeling; that it is all benignity and candor. And the trial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences with the prayer of the Court, expre≈ø≈øed by the Clerk, to the Supream JUDGE of Judges, empires and worlds: "God ≈øend you a good deliverance."</p>
                        <p>We find, in the rules laid down by the greate≈øt Engli≈øh Judges, who have been the brighte≈øt of mankind;‚ÄîWe are to look upon it as more beneficial, that many guilty per≈øons ≈øhould e≈øcape unpuni≈øhed, than one innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon ≈øhould ≈øuffer. The rea≈øon is, becau≈øe it's of more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to community, that innocence ≈øhould be protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than it is, that guilt ≈øhould be puni≈øhed; for guilt and crimes are ≈øo frequent in the world, that all of them can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be puni≈øhed; and many times they happen in ≈øuch a manner, that it is not of much con≈øequence to the public, whether they are puni≈øhed or not. But when innocence it ≈øelf, is brought to the bar and condemned, e≈øpecially to die, the ≈øubject will exclaim, it is immaterial to me, whether I behave well or ill; for virtue it≈øelf, is no ≈øecurity. And if ≈øuch a ≈øentiment as this, ≈øhould take place in the mind of the ≈øubject, there would be an end to all ≈øecurity what≈øoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.

it is better, five guilty per≈øons ≈øhould e≈øcape unpuni≈øhed, than one innocent per≈øon ≈øhould die.</p>
                        <p>The next authority ≈øhall be from another Judge, of equal character, con≈øidering the age wherein he lived; that is Chancellor <hi>Forte≈øcue,</hi> in prai≈øe of the laws of England, page 59, this is a very ancient writer on the Engli≈øh law: his words are, "Indeed one would rather, much rather, that twenty guilty per≈øons e≈øcape the puni≈øhment of death, than one innocent per≈øon be condemned, and ≈øuffer capitally." Lord Chief Ju≈øtice <hi>Hale,</hi> ≈øays, It is better five guilty per≈øons e≈øcape, than one innocent per≈øon ≈øuffer. Lord Chancellor <hi>Forti≈øcue,</hi> you ≈øee, carries the matter farther, and ≈øays, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed one had rather, much rather, that twenty guilty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons ≈øhould e≈øcape, than one innocent per≈øon ≈øuffer capitally. Indeed this rule is not peculiar to the Engli≈øh law, there never was a ≈øy≈øtem of laws in the world, in which this rule did not prevail; it prevailed in the ancient Roman law, and which is more remarkable, it prevails in the modern Roman law, even the Judges in the Courts of Inqui≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who with racks, burnings and ≈øcourges, examine cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals, even there, they pre≈øerve it as a maxim, that it is better the guilty ≈øhould e≈øcape puni≈øhment, than the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ≈øuffer. <hi>Satius e≈ø≈øe nocentem ab≈øolvi quam in≈øentem damnari,</hi> this is the temper we ought to ≈øet out with; and the≈øe the rules we are to be governed by. And I ≈øhall take it for granted, as a fir≈øt principle, that the eight pri≈øoners at the bar, had better be all acquitted, though we ≈øhould admit them all to be guilty, than, that any one of them ≈øhould by your verdict be found guilty, being innocent.</p>
                        <p>I ≈øhall now con≈øider the ≈øeveral divi≈øions of law, under which the evidence will arrange it≈øelf.</p>
                        <p>The action now before you, is homicide; that is the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of one man by another, the law calls it homicide, but it is not criminal in all ca≈øes, for one man to ≈ølay another. Had the pri≈øoners been on the <hi>Plains of Abraham,</hi> and ≈ølain an hundred <hi>Frenchmen</hi> a piece, the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> law would have con≈øidered it, as a commendable action, virtuous and prai≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy: ≈øo that every in≈øtance of killing a man, is not a crime in the eye of the law; there are many other in≈øtances which I can not enumerate, an officer that executes a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon under ≈øentence of death, &amp;c. So that Gentlemen, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in≈øtance of one man's killing another, is not a crime,
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:011683_0076_0F87C7FA76B4A768"/>
much le≈øs a crime to be puni≈øhed with death. But to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcend to ≈øome more particulars.</p>
                        <p>The law divides homicide into three branches; the fir≈øt, is ju≈øtifiable, the ≈øecond excu≈øable, and the third felonious; felonious homicide, is ≈øubdivided into two branches; the fir≈øt is murder, which is killing with malice aforethought, the ≈øecond is man≈ølaughter, which is killing a man on a ≈øudden provocation: here Gentlemen, are four ≈øorts of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micide, and you are to con≈øider, whether all the evidence amounts to the fir≈øt, ≈øecond, third, or fourth, of the≈øe heads. The fact, was the ≈ølaying five unhappy per≈øons that night; you are to con≈øider, whether it was ju≈øtifiable, excu≈øable, or felonious; and if felonious, whether it was murder or man≈ølaughter. One of the≈øe four it mu≈øt be, you need not divide your attention to any more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. I ≈øhall however, before I come to the evidence, ≈øhow you ≈øeveral authorities, which will a≈ø≈øi≈øt you and me in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating the evidence before us.</p>
                        <p>I ≈øhall begin with ju≈øtifialbe homicide; if an officer a ≈øheriff execute a man on the gallows, draws and quarters him, as in ca≈øe of high trea≈øon, and cuts off his head, this is ju≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable homicide, it is his duty. So al≈øo, Gentlemen, the law has planted fences and barriers around every individual; it is a ca≈øtle round every man's per≈øon, as well as his hou≈øe.‚Äî As the love of God and our neighbour, comprehends the whole duty of man, ≈øo ≈øelf-love and ≈øocial, comprehend all the duties we owe to mankind, and the fir≈øt branch is ≈øelf-love, which is not only our indi≈øputable right, but our cleare≈øt duty, by the laws of nature, this is interwoven in the heart of every individual; God almighty, who≈øe laws we cannot alter, has implanted it there, and we can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilate our≈øelves, as ea≈øily as root out this affection for our≈øelves. It is the fir≈øt, and ≈øtronge≈øt principle in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Ju≈øtice <hi>Black≈øtone</hi> calls it, "The primary cannon in the law of nature." That precept of our holy religion which commands us to love our neighbour as our≈øelves doth not command us to love our neighbour better than our≈øelves, or ≈øo well, no Chri≈øtian Divine hath given this interpretation. The precept enjoins, that our benevolence to our fellow men, ≈øhould be as real and ≈øincere, as our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to our≈øelves, not that it ≈øhould be as great in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. A man is authori≈øed therefore by common ≈øen≈øe, and the laws of Egland, as well as tho≈øe of nature, to love

The rules of the common law therefore, which authorize a man to pre≈øerve his own life at the expence of another's, are not contradicted by any divine or moral law. We talk of liberty and property, but, if we cut up the law of ≈øelf-defence, we cut up the foundation of both, and if we give up this, the re≈øt is of very little value, and therefore, this principle mu≈øt be ≈øtrictly attended to, for what≈øoever the law pronounces in the ca≈øe of the≈øe eight ≈øoldiers will be the law, to other per≈øons and after ages, all the per≈øons that have ≈ølain mankind in this country, from the beginning to this day, had better have been acquitted, than that a wrong rule and precedent ≈øhould be e≈øtabli≈øhed.</p>
                        <p>I ≈øhall now, read to you a few authorities on this ≈øubject of ≈øelf-defence. Fo≈øter 273 in the ca≈øe of ju≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable ≈øelf-defence, "The injured party may repell force with force in defence of his per≈øon, habitation, or property, again≈øt one who manife≈øtly intendeth and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoureth with violence, or ≈øurprize, to commit a known felony upon either."‚ÄîIn the≈øe ca≈øes, he is not obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, but may pur≈øue his adver≈øary, till he findeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf out of danger, and if in a conflict between them he happeneth to kill, ≈øuch killing is ju≈øtifiable." Keiling, 128, 129. I mu≈øt intreat you, to con≈øider the words of this authority, the injured per≈øon may repell force by force again≈øt any who endeavours to commit any kind of felony on him or his, here the rule is, I have a right to ≈øtand on my own defence, if you intend to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit felony; if any of the per≈øons made an attack on the≈øe ≈øoldiers, with an intention to rob them, if it was but to take their hats feloniou≈øly, they had a right to kill them on the ≈øpot, and had no bu≈øine≈øs to retreat; if a robber meets me in the ≈øtreet, and commands me to ≈øurrender my pur≈øe, I have a right to kill him without a≈øking que≈øtions; if a per≈øons commits a bare a≈ø≈øault on me, this will not ju≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify killing, but if he a≈ø≈øaults me in ≈øuch a manner, as to di≈øcover an intention, to kill me, I have a right to de≈øtroy him, that I may put it out of his power to kill me. In the ca≈øe you will have to con≈øider, I do not know there was any attempt to ≈øteal from the≈øe per≈øons; however,

there were ≈øome per≈øons concerned, who would probably enough have ≈øtolen, if there had been any thing to ≈øteal; and many were there who had no ≈øuch di≈øpo≈øition, but this is not the point we aim at, the que≈øtion is, are you ≈øatisfied, the people made the attack in order to kill the ≈øoldiers?

                        <p>I. H. H. P. C. 437. "All pre≈øent, aiding and a≈ø≈øi≈øting, are equally principal with him that gave the ≈øtroke, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the party died. For tho' one gave the ≈øtroke, yet in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of law, it is the ≈øtroke of every per≈øon, that was pre≈øent aiding and a≈ø≈øi≈øting."</p>
                        <p>I. H. H. P. C. 440. "If divers come with one a≈ø≈øent to do mi≈øchief, as to kill, rob, or beat, and one doth it, they are all principals in the felony.

                        <p>Now if the party at <hi>Deck-≈øquare,</hi> came with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention only to beat the ≈øoldiers, and began the affray with them, and any of them had been accidentally killed, it would have been murder, becau≈øe it was an unlawful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øign

they came upon; if but one does it, they are all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidered in the eye of the law to be guilty, if any one gives the mortal ≈øtroke, they are all principal here, therefore there is a rever≈øal of the ≈øcene; if you are ≈øatisfied, that the≈øe ≈øoldiers were there on a lawful de≈øign and it ≈øhould be proved any of them ≈øhot without provocation and killed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny body, he only is an≈øwerable for it. Fir≈øt Hale's pleas of the crown.</p>
                        <p>I. H. H. P. C. 444. "Although if many come upon an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful de≈øign, and one of the company kill one of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øe party, in pur≈øuance of that de≈øign, all are principals; yet if many be together upon a lawful account, and one of the company, kill another of an adver≈øe party, without any particular abetment of the re≈øt to this fact of homicide they are not all guilty that are of the company, but only tho≈øe that gave the ≈øtroke or actually abetted him to do it."</p>
                        <p>I. H. H. P. C. 445. "In the ca≈øe of a riotous a≈ø≈øembly to rob or ≈øteal deer, or do any unlawful act of violence, there the offence of one, is the offence of all the company."</p>
                        <p>In an other place, I. H. H. P. C. 439. "The <hi>Lord Dacre</hi> and divers others went to ≈øteal deer in the park of one Pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham ‚ÄîRaydon one of the company, killed the keeper in the park: the <hi>Lord Dacre</hi> and the re≈øt of the company being in the other part of the park.

So that in ≈øo ≈øtrong a ca≈øe as this, where this nobleman ≈øet out to hunt deer in the ground of another, he was in one part of the park, his company in another part, yet they were all guilty of murder."</p>

                        <p>Thus far I have proceeded, and I believe it will not be hereafter di≈øputed by any body, that this law ought to be known to every one who has any di≈øpo≈øition to be concerned in an unlawful a≈ø≈øembly, whatever mi≈øchief happens in the pro≈øecution of the de≈øign they ≈øet out upon, all are an≈øwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for it.

                              <p>I ≈øhall not enter into any enquiry, how far the Admiralty ≈øe≈ø≈øions in England, or a Special Court of Admiralty in America ought to proceed by the rules of civil law, though it is a que≈øtion of immen≈øe importance to Americans. But mu≈øt beg leave to ob≈øerve that though the di≈øtinction between Murder and Man≈ølaughter is not found in words in the civil law, yet the di≈øtinction between homicide, with deliberation and without deliberation, and on a ≈øudden provocation is well known in that law, and the former is puni≈øhed with death, the later, with ≈øome inferior corporal puni≈øhment at the di≈øcretion of the Judges.</p>
                              <p>Indeed, the civil law is more favourable, and indulgent to ≈øudden anger and re≈øent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than the common law, and allows many things to be a provocation ≈øufficient to exempt the per≈øon killing from the <hi>Paena ordinaria,</hi> which is death, which the common law con≈øiders as a ≈ølight provocation or none at all.</p>

it be ever ≈øo ≈ølight, and ≈øometimes even without a blow.

But no words can amount to an a≈ø≈øault." Here is the defintion of an a≈ø≈øault, which is a ≈øufficient provocation to ≈øoften kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down to man≈ølaughter. 1. Hawkin's, Chap. 31. ¬ß 36.

them or not.

                        <p>I ye≈øterday afternoon produced from the be≈øt authorities, tho≈øe rules of law which mu≈øt govern all ca≈øes of homicide, particularly that which is now before you; it now remains to con≈øider the evidence, and ≈øee whether any thing has occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that may be compared to the rules read to you; and I will not trouble my≈øelf nor you with laboured endeavours to be methodical, I ≈øhall endeavour to make ≈øome few ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervations, on the te≈øtimonies of the witne≈ø≈øes, ≈øuch as will place the facts in a true point of light, with as much brevity as po≈ø≈øible; but I ≈øuppo≈øe it would take me four hours to read to you, (if I did nothing el≈øe but read) the

minutes of evidence that I have taken in this trial. In the fir≈øt place the Gentleman who opened this cau≈øe, has ≈øtated to you, with candour and preci≈øion, the evidence of the iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the per≈øons.</p>
                        <p>The witne≈ø≈øes are confident that they know the pri≈øoners at the barr, and that they were pre≈øent that night, and of the party; however, it is apparent, that witne≈ø≈øes are lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make mi≈øtakes, by a ≈øingle example before you. Mr. <hi>Ba≈øs,</hi> who is a very hone≈øt man, and of good character, ≈øwears po≈øitively that the tall man, <hi>Warren,</hi> ≈øtood on the right that night, and was the fir≈øt that fired; and I am ≈øure you are ≈øatisfied by this time, by many circum≈øtances, that he is totally mi≈øtaken in this matter; this you will con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at your lei≈øure. The witne≈ø≈øes in general did not know the faces of the≈øe per≈øons before; very few of them knew the names of them before, they only took notice of their faces that night. How much certainty there is in this evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, I leave you to determine.</p>
                        <p>There does not ≈øeem to me to be any thing very material in the te≈øtimony of Mr. <hi>A≈øton,</hi> except to the identity of <hi>M'Cauley,</hi> and he is the only witne≈øs to that. If you can be ≈øatisfied in your own minds, without a doubt, that he knew <hi>M'Cauley</hi> ≈øo well as to be ≈øure, you will believe he was there.</p>
                        <p>The next witne≈øs is <hi>Bridgham,</hi> he ≈øays he ≈øaw the tall man <hi>Warren,</hi> but ≈øaw another man belonging to the ≈øame regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ≈øoon after, ≈øo like him, as to make him doubt whether it was <hi>Warren</hi> or not; he thinks he ≈øaw the <hi>Corporal,</hi> but is not certain, he ≈øays he was at the corner of the <hi>Cu≈øtom hou≈øe,</hi> this you will take notice of, other witne≈ø≈øes ≈øwear, he was the remote≈øt man of all from him who fired fir≈øt, and there are other evidences who ≈øwear the left man did not fire at all; if <hi>Wemms</hi> did not di≈øcharge his gun at all, he could not kill any of the per≈øons, therefore he mu≈øt be acquitted on the fact of killing; for an intention to kill, is not mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der nor man≈ølaughter, if not carried into execution: The witne≈øs ≈øaw numbers of things thrown, and he ≈øaw plainly ≈øticks ≈øtrike the guns, about a dozen per≈øons with ≈øticks, gave three cheers, and ≈øurrounded the party, and ≈øtruck the guns with their ≈øticks ≈øeveral blows: This is a witne≈øs for the crown, and his te≈øtimony is of great weight for the pri≈øoners; he gives his te≈øtimony very ≈øen≈øibly and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially. He ≈øwears po≈øitively, that he not only ≈øaw ice or ≈ønow thrown, but ≈øaw the gus ≈øtruck ≈øeveral times; if you

It can ≈øcarcely amount to proof that he harboured any ≈øettled malice again≈øt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in general.

                        <p>Some of the witne≈ø≈øes, have ≈øworn that <hi>Gray</hi> was active in the battle at the Rope walks, and that <hi>Killroy</hi> was once there, from whence the Council for the Crown would infer, that <hi>Killroy</hi>; in <hi>King ≈øtreet,</hi> on the 5th of <hi>March</hi> in the night, kenw <hi>Gray</hi> whom he had ≈øeen at the Rope-walks before, and took that opportunity to gratify his preconceived malice; but if this is all true, it will not take away from him his ju≈øtification, excu≈øe, or extenuation, if he had any.‚Äî The rule of the law is, if there has been mallice between two, and at a di≈øtant time afterwards they met, and one of them a≈ø≈øaults the other's life, or only a≈ø≈øaults him, and he kills in con≈øequence of it, the law pre≈øumes the killing was in ≈øelf defence, or upon the provocation, not on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the antecedent malice. If therefore the a≈ø≈øault upon <hi>Killroy</hi> was ≈øo violent as to endanger his life, he had as good a right to defend him≈øelf, as much as if he never had before conceived any malice again≈øt the people in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or Mr. <hi>Gray</hi> in particular.

his crime will be man≈ølaughter only. However, it does not appear, that he knew Mr. <hi>Gray</hi>; none of the witne≈ø≈øes pretend to ≈øay he knew him, or that he ever ≈øaw him. It is true they were both at the Rope-walks at one time, but there were ≈øo many combatants on each ≈øide, that it is not even probable that <hi>Killroy</hi> ≈øhould know them all, and no witne≈øs ≈øays there was any rencounter there between them two. Indeed, to return to Mr. <hi>Langford</hi>'s te≈øtimony, he ≈øays, he did not perceive <hi>Killroy</hi> to aim at <hi>Gray,</hi> more than at him, but he ≈øays expre≈øsly, he did not aim at <hi>Gray.</hi> ‚Äî<hi>Langford</hi> ≈øays, "<hi>Gray</hi> had no ≈øtick, was ≈øtanding with his arms folded up,"‚ÄîThis witne≈øs, is however mo≈øt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably mi≈øtaken in this matter and con≈øounds one time with another, a mi≈øtake which has been made by many witne≈ø≈øes, in this ca≈øe, and con≈øidering the confu≈øion and terror of the ≈øcene, is not to be wondered at‚Äî</p>

                        <p>As to the fir≈øt, you have not only the corouer's inque≈øt, but the te≈øtimony of ≈øo many witne≈ø≈øes, that the five per≈øons were ≈øhot and thereby mortally wounded in the night of the 5th of <hi>March</hi> la≈øt, and that ≈øome of them died in≈øtantly, and the re≈øt in a few days after, that you doubtle≈øs will be ≈øatisfied they were all killed.

                        <p>Whether the pri≈øoners were there, will therefore be your next enquiry; for if either of them was not, he mu≈øt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted. You have the te≈øtimony of <hi>Bridgham</hi> and <hi>Simp≈øon</hi> as to <hi>Wemms</hi>; of <hi>Danbrooke</hi> and <hi>Simp≈øon</hi> as to <hi>Hartegan,</hi> of <hi>Au≈øtin</hi> as to <hi>M'Cauley</hi>; of <hi>Simp≈øon, Langford.

But if you are ≈øatisfied upon the evidence, that all the pri≈øoners were there, yet, as each pri≈øoner is ≈øeverally charged with having killed the≈øe five per≈øons, and by his plea has denied the charge, you mu≈øt be fully ≈øatisfied upon the evidence given you, with regard to each pri≈øoner, that he in particular,

did <hi>in fact,</hi> or <hi>in con≈øideration of law,</hi> kill one or more of the≈øe per≈øons that were ≈ølain, or he mu≈øt be acquitted.</p>
                        <p>The way therefore to determine this, will be for you to name ≈øome one of the pri≈øoners, and then con≈øider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it appears upon the evidence in the ca≈øe, that he did <hi>in fact</hi> kill <hi>Maverick?</hi> And then, whether upon the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence it appears, he <hi>in fact</hi> killed <hi>Gray?</hi> And ≈øo enquire in the ≈øame manner, whether he did <hi>in fact</hi> kill either of the other three per≈øons? And having noted how it appears up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the evidence with regard to him; you mu≈øt then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in like manner with each of the other pri≈øoners; and if upon a full con≈øideration of the evidence in the ca≈øe, you ≈øhould be in doubt, as to any one of the pri≈øouers having <hi>in fact</hi> killed either of the per≈øons that were ≈ølain, you mu≈øt con≈øider whether he did it <hi>in con≈øideration of law?</hi> Now all that are pre≈øent, aiding and abetting one per≈øon in killing another, do, in judgment of law, kill him. The ≈øtroke of one is, in con≈øideration of law, the ≈øtroke of all. When a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of per≈øons a≈ø≈øemble together to do an unlawful act, and in pro≈øecution of that de≈øign, one of them kills a man, all the re≈øt of the company are in law con≈øidered as abetting him to do it.<note n="(a)" place="bottom">1. <hi>Hale.</hi> 440, 1. <hi>Fo≈øt.</hi> 351,</note>

                        <p>You mu≈øt therefore enquire how, and for what purpo≈øe, the pri≈øoners came together at the <hi>Cu≈øtom hou≈øe,</hi> and what they did there before the≈øe per≈øon were killed?</p>
                        <p>The Council for the pri≈øoners ≈øay, that, if they were at the <hi>Cu≈øtom-hou≈øe</hi> that night, they went there by order of the <hi>Captain</hi> of the <hi>Main-guard,</hi> to ≈øupport and protect the Sentry, who was in≈øulted, a≈ø≈øaulted and abu≈øed by a con≈øiderable number of people, a≈ø≈øembled for that purpo≈øe; but as this is denied by the Council for the Crown, it will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to con≈øider whether, a Sentry was duly placed at the <hi>Cu≈øtom-hou≈øe?</hi> And if ≈øo, whether he was attacked?

I would ob≈øerve, that as the main de≈øign of ≈øociety, is the protection of individuals by the united ≈øtrength of the whole community; ≈øo for the ≈øake of unanimity, ≈øtrength and di≈øpatch, the ≈øupreme executive power is by the Briti≈øh con≈øtitution ve≈øted in a ≈øingle per≈øon, the King or Queen. This ≈øingle per≈øon has the ≈øole power of rai≈øing fleets or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and the Statute of 13 <hi>Car</hi> 2. c. 6. declares, That within all his Maje≈øty's realms and <hi>dominions,</hi> the ≈øole ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme government, command and <hi>di≈øpo≈øition</hi> of the militia, and of <hi>all forces</hi> by ≈øea and land, and <hi>all ≈øorts</hi> and <hi>places of ≈øtrength</hi> is, and by the law of <hi>England</hi> ever was, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted right of his Maje≈øty and his royal Predece≈ø≈øors, Kings and Queens of <hi>England.</hi> And as <hi>Charles</hi> the Second had this right as King of <hi>England,</hi> it of cour≈øe comes to his ≈øucce≈ø≈øors, and our pre≈øent Soverereign Lord the King, now hath it.</p>
                        <p>Indeed the Bill of Rights declares among other things, That the rai≈øing or keeping a ≈øtanding army, within the kingdom, in a time of peace, unle≈øs with the con≈øent of Parliament, is again≈øt law. And it is ≈øaid, that upon the ≈øame principles whereon that declaration was founded, it is alike unlawful to be doue in any other part of the King's dominious. But be that as it may, the Mutiny Acts annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally made, ≈øhew the con≈øent of Parliament, that the King in time of peace ≈øhould keep up a ≈øtanding army not only in the Kingdom, but in <hi>America</hi> al≈øo. They not only a≈øcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the number of troops that ≈øhall be kept up, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the regulation of ≈øuch of the King's troops as are in <hi>America.</hi> And therefore as by the≈øe acts the King is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to keep up the≈øe troops, and he, by common law, has the command and di≈øpo≈øition of all forces by ≈øea and land within his dominions, and is the principal con≈øervator of the peace, he doubtle≈øs, well might ≈øend ≈øuch part of tho≈øe troops to this part of his dominions, in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtore the public peace, or to aid and a≈ø≈øi≈øt the civil Magi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate in pre≈øerving of it, as he judged nece≈ø≈øary for the purpo≈øe; and if you ≈øhould think there was no occa≈øion for ≈øending any troops here, for either of tho≈øe purpo≈øes, that will not alter the ca≈øe, becau≈øe the King being the proper judge in that matter, the validity of his order will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the truth of the repre≈øentations whereon it is founded.

Among other things, the Acts ≈øubject every officer or ≈øoldier that ≈øleeps on his po≈øt, or leaves it before he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, or di≈øobeys the <hi>lawful</hi> command of his ≈øuperior of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, to ≈øuch puni≈øhment as a Court Martial ≈øhall inflict,‚Äî though it extend to death it≈øelf.

If ≈øo, you have no rea≈øon to doubt but that it was legally done.</p>
                        <p>Your next enquiry then will be, whether the Sentry ≈øo placed at the <hi>Cu≈øtom hou≈øe</hi> was attacked? Many witne≈ø≈øes have ≈øworn that he was. But the Council for the Crown ≈øay, the contrary appears by the te≈øtimony of Col. <hi>Mar≈øhal</hi> and others.</p>
                        <p>It is with you to determine this matter upon the whole of the evidence given you. In doing it you ought to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the ≈øeveral te≈øtimonies, if by any rea≈øonable con≈øtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the words it may be done.‚Äî Where ≈øome witne≈ø≈øes ≈øwear they ≈øaw ≈øuch a thing done, and others ≈øwear they were pre≈øent and did not ≈øee it: if the thing ≈øaid to be done be ≈øuch as it may rea≈øonably be ≈øuppo≈øed ≈øome might ≈øee and others not, by rea≈øon of their want of ob≈øervation, or particular attention to other matters there, as both may be true, you ought to ≈øuppo≈øe them to be ≈øo, rather than pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øume that any of the witne≈ø≈øes ≈øwear fal≈øly. But if witne≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes contradict each other, ≈øo that their te≈øtimonies cannot be reconciled, you mu≈øt then con≈øider the number of the witne≈ø≈øes on each ≈øide, their ability, integrity, indifference as to the point in que≈øtion, and the probability or improbability ari≈øing from the nature of the thing in que≈øtion, and upon the whole ≈øettle the fact as you verily believe it to be. If you find the Sentry was attacked, the next thing to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidered is, whether the pri≈øoners went to protect him, and it ≈øo, whether it was lawful for them ≈øo to do.

their guns backwards and forwards crying ≈øtand off, ≈øtand off, without moving from their ≈øtation, you will con≈øider whether this may not be what other witne≈ø≈øes call an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to ≈øtab the people. But, be that as it may, if the party was a lawful a≈ø≈øembly before, this not being the act of the whole, would not make it unlawful. The Council for the Crown in≈øi≈øt that the firing upon the people was an unlawful act, in di≈øturbance of the peace, and as the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fired ≈øo near together, it mu≈øt be ≈øuppo≈øed they previou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreed to do it; that agreement made them an unlawful a≈ø≈øembly, if they were not ≈øo before, and being ≈øo when they fired, all are chargeable with the killing by any one or more of them. However ju≈øt this rea≈øoning may be, where there is no apparent cau≈øe for their firing, yet it will not hold good where there is.

But it is ≈øaid that if their firing as they did, don't prove a previous agreement to do it, yet it is good evidence of an actual abetment to fire, as one by firing encourages the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to do the like. As neither of the ≈øoldiers fired more than once, it is evident that he who fired la≈øt, could not thereby in fact, abet or encourage the firing of any of tho≈øe who fired before him, and ≈øo it cannot be evidence of
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:011683_0098_0F87C8169D3A0670"/>
≈øuch abetment. And if he who fired fir≈øt and killed, can ju≈øtify it, becau≈øe it was lawful for him ≈øo to do, ≈øurely that ≈øame lawful act cannot be evidence of an unlawful abetment. And though he who fir≈øt fired and killed, may not be able to ju≈øtify the doing it, yet if it appears he had ≈øuch a cau≈øe for the killing as will reduce it to Man≈ølaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it would be ≈øtrange indeed if that ≈øame act ≈øhould be evidence of his abetting another who killed without provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, ≈øo as to make him who fired fir≈øt guilty of murder. The ≈øame may be ≈øaid as to all the intermediate firings: and, as the evidence ≈øtands, I don't think it nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øay how it would be in ca≈øe the fir≈øt per≈øon fired with little or no provocation. If therefore this party of ≈øoldiers, when at the <hi>Cu≈øtom hou≈øe,</hi> were a lawful a≈ø≈øembly and continued ≈øo until they fired, and their firing was not an actual <hi>unlawful</hi> abetment of each other to fire, nor evidence of it, they cannot be ≈øaid to have <hi>in con≈øideration of law</hi> killed tho≈øe five per≈øons or either of them, but it mu≈øt re≈øt on the evidence of the actual killing: and, if ≈øo, neither of the pri≈øoners can be found guilty thereof, unle≈øs it appears not only that he was of the party, but that he in particular <hi>in fact</hi> did kill one or more of the per≈øons ≈ølain. That the five per≈øons were killed by the party of ≈øoldiers or ≈øome of them, ≈øeems clear upon the evidence, and indeed is not di≈øputed.</p>
                        <p>Some witne≈ø≈øes have been produced to prove that <hi>Montgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery</hi> killed <hi>Attucks</hi>; and <hi>Langford</hi> ≈øwears <hi>Kulroy</hi> killed <hi>Gray,</hi> but none of the witne≈ø≈øes undertake to ≈øay that either of the other pri≈øoners in particular killed either of the other three per≈øons, or that all of them did it. On the contrary it ≈øeems that one of the ≈øix did not fire, and that another of them fired at a boy as he was running down the ≈øtreet, but mi≈ø≈øed him (if he had killed him, as the evidence ≈øtands, it would have been murder) but the witne≈ø≈øes are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed as to the per≈øon who fired at the boy, or as to him who did not fire at all. It is highly probable, from the places where the five per≈øons killed fell and their wounds, that they were killed by the di≈øcharge of five ≈øeveral guns only. If you are upon the evidence, ≈øatisfied of that, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo that <hi>Montgomery</hi> killed <hi>Attucks,</hi> and <hi>Killroy Gray,</hi> it will thence follow that the other three, were killed, not by the other ≈øix pri≈øoners, but by three of them only: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they cannot all be found guilty of it. And as the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence does not ≈øhew which three killed the three, nor that

                        <p>You will therefore, carefully con≈øider and weigh the whole of the evidence given you re≈øpecting the attack, made upon the party of ≈øoldiers <hi>in general,</hi> and upon <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery</hi> in particular. In doing it, you will ob≈øerve the rules I have before mentioned, and not forget the part that ≈øome of the witne≈ø≈øes took in this unhappy affair, and if upon the whole it appears to you, that <hi>Montgomery</hi> was attacked, in ≈øuch a violent manner, as that his life was in immediate danger, or that he had ≈øufficient rea≈øon to think it was, and he thereupon fired and killed <hi>Attucks,</hi> for the pre≈øervation of his own life, it was ju≈øtifiable homicide; and he ought to be acquitted.‚ÄîIf you do not believe that was, the ca≈øe, but upon the evidence are ≈øatisfied, that he was by that a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øembly, a≈ø≈øaulted with clubs and other weapons, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon fired at the rioters and killed <hi>Attucks</hi>: then you ought to find him guilty of man≈ølaughter only. But if upon the evidence you believe, that <hi>Montgomery,</hi> without being previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øly a≈ø≈øaulted, fired, and killed <hi>Attucks</hi>: then you will find him guilty of muder But you mu≈øt know, that if this party of ≈øoldiers <hi>in general</hi> were pelted, with ≈ønow-balls, pieces of ice and ≈øticks, <hi>in anger,</hi> this, without more, amounts to an a≈ø≈øault, not only upon tho≈øe that were in fact ≈øtruck, but upon the whole party; and is ≈øuch an a≈ø≈øault as will reduce the killing to man≈ølaughter. And if you believe, what ≈øome of the witne≈ø≈øes have ≈øworn, that the people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round the ≈øoldiers, and many of them armed with clubs, crouded upon the ≈øoldiers, and with the cry of, "Ru≈øh on, Kill them, Kill them, Knock them over," did in fact ru≈øh on, ≈øtrike at them with their clubs, and give <hi>Montgomery</hi>

≈øuch a blow, as to knock him down, as ≈øome of the witne≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes ≈øay, or to make him ≈øally, or ≈øtagger, as others ≈øay‚Äîit will be ≈øufficient to ≈øhow, that his life was in immediate danger, or that he had ≈øufficient rea≈øon to think ≈øo.</p>
                        <p>It ≈øeems, a doctrine, has of late been advanced, "that ≈øoldiers while on duty, may upon <hi>no occa≈øion whatever</hi> fire upon their fellow ≈øubjects, without the order of a civil magi≈øtrate." This may po≈ø≈øibly account, for ≈øome of tho≈øe who attacked the ≈øolders, ≈øaying to them, "You dare not fire, we know you dare not fire."‚ÄîBut it ought to be known, that the law doth not countenance ≈øuch an ab≈øurd doctrine. A man by becoming a ≈øoldier, doth not thereby lo≈øe the right of ≈øelf-defence which is founded in the law of nature. Where any one is, without his own default, reduced to ≈øuch circum≈øtances, as that the laws of ≈øociety cannot avail him, the law con≈øiders him, "as <hi>≈øtill in that in≈øtance</hi> under the protection of the law of nature."<note n="(i)" place="bottom">
                              <hi>Fo≈øter</hi> 274, 5.</note> This rule extends to ≈øoldiers as well as others; nay, while ≈øoldiers are in the immediate ≈øervice of the King, and the regular di≈øcharge of their duty, they rather come within the <hi>rea≈øon,</hi> of civil officers and their a≈ø≈øi≈øtants, and ≈øo are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like under the <hi>peculiar</hi> protection of the law.</p>
                        <p>If you are ≈øatisfied upon the evidence, that <hi>Killroy</hi> killed <hi>Gray,</hi> you will then enquire, whether it was ju≈øtifiable, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øable or felonious homicide, and if the latter, whether it was with, or without malice. If the attack was upon the party of ≈øoldiers <hi>in general,</hi> and in the manner I have ju≈øt mentioned, as ≈øome of the witne≈ø≈øes ≈øay it was, it is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an a≈ø≈øault upon all, whether all were in fact ≈øtruck, or not, and makes no material difference, as to their re≈øpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive right of firing: for a man is not obliged to wait un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he is killed, or ≈øtruck, before he makes u≈øe of the nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary means of ≈øelf defence. If the blows with clubs were, by an enraged multitude, aimed at the party <hi>in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> each one might rea≈øonably think his own life in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; for though he e≈øcaped the fir≈øt blow, he might rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonably expect more would follow, and could have no a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurance, that he ≈øhould be ≈øo fortunate as to e≈øcape all of them.</p>
                        <p>And therefore, I do not ≈øee but that <hi>Killroy</hi> is upon the ≈øame ≈øooting with <hi>Montgomery;</hi> and your verdict mu≈øt be

"He never would mi≈øs an opportunity, when he had one, to fire on the inhabitants, and that he had wanted to have an opportunity, ever ≈øince he landed." But he ≈øays, he cannot remember what words immediately preceded or followed, or at what particular time the words were uttered, nor does he know whether <hi>Killroy</hi> was jocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, or not. If the witne≈øs is not mi≈øtaken as to the words, the ≈øpeech was at lea≈øt, very imprudent and fooli≈øh.

you.</hi>" He had a cane with a ≈øword in it in his hand, and compelled me to fire both the guns. After I had fired the≈øe two guns, Mr. <hi>Manwarring</hi> fired one gun al≈øo out of the ≈øame window. The tall man loaded the three guns, and I ≈øee him put the balls into each of them and heard them go gown. The two guns I fired, I pointed up the ≈øtreet and in the air. When my ma≈øter Mr. <hi>Manwarring</hi> pointed his gun out of the window I was in the room, but went out and was on the ≈øtairs before his gun went off, I heard it, but did not ≈øee it. As ≈øoon as I had fired, the tall man took me down ≈øtairs, and ≈øaid he would give me money if I would not tell: I replied, I did not want any money, but if I was called before the Ju≈øtices, I would tell the truth. There were a great many people in the hou≈øe, and a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of people round me in the chamber where I fired, I can't tell the preci≈øe number, but there were more than ten, Mr. <hi>Munro</hi> and <hi>Hammond Green</hi> were in the hou≈øe below ≈øtairs, Mr. <hi>Manwarring</hi> was in the chamber when all the three guns were lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There was a candle in the chamber, but I cannot tell whether there were one or two windows in it. When I came up into the chamber, there were two guns in it, I fired twice out of the ≈øame gun, but I cannot tell whether Mr. <hi>Manwarring</hi> fired the ≈øame gun I did. At the time I and my ma≈øter fired, the ≈øtreet below was full of people, and the mob were throwing ≈øticks, ≈ønow-balls, &amp;c. It was pretty dark, but I don't know but there might be a little moon. I can't tell whether the guns my ma≈øter and I fired, were fired before or after the firing by the ≈øoldiers. When I went from Mr. <hi>Hud≈øon</hi>'s to the <hi>Cu≈øtom hou≈øe,</hi> I pa≈ø≈øed through the lane that leads from the <hi>Market</hi> to the <hi>Cu≈øtom hou≈øe,</hi> (<hi>Royal-exchange-lane</hi>) and I did not ≈øee the Sentry box or any ≈øoldiers near the <hi>Cu≈øtom hou≈øe</hi>; there were many people round there in the ≈øtreet. Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after I went down ≈øtairs, I went out of the hou≈øe and ≈øaw a great number of people throwing ≈ønow-balls and ≈øticks, but I ≈øaw no ≈øoldiers.
