            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THIS <hi>COURT</hi> being sensible of the solemn Rebukes of God upon his poor People throughout this Land, from year to year, our Doings against the Lord having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the eyes of his glory, so as that he hath visited us with the Sword, and since that, hath given a Commission to the destroying Angel, in respect of a sore and terrible Disease, which hath been of long continuance, and more contagious and mortal then in former times; and his holy Hand is in that way stretched out stil over some of our Plantations. And very lately, the Lord God hath called to contend by Fire, which hath devoured a great part of that Town, in whose welfare all New-England is concerned; and therefore we have all cause with bleeding hearts, to lament over the doleful Ruines and Desolations, which the Lord for our iniquityes hath in one day brought upon us: especially considering, that at the same time, God is taking away from us the Fruits of the earth, by a greater Blasting then heretofore we have had experience of. And the Lords Watchmen, with the generality of serious Christians, are not without sad thoughts of heart lest if we be not reformed by these things, God should punish us yet seven times for our sins, yea and at last remove our Candlesticks out of their places: and there are already some awfull Symptoms of a Famine of hearing the Word of the Lord; and other spiritual Judgments, calling upon us to gather our selves together, in a way of solemn Humiliation and Repentance before the Decree bring forth. Being also sensible that the Churches of Christ abroad in the world, are wrestling with sore distressing difficultyes, in this day of trouble, when the Children are come to the birth, but there is not strength to bring forth,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Do therefore appoint the second</hi> Thursday <hi>in</hi> December <hi>next, to be observed as a day of publick Humiliation throughout this Jurisdiction, earnestly exhorting all the Inhabitants thereof not only to confess but to forsake their Sins, that so they may find mercy with God through Jesus Christ, and to cry mightily to Heaven, as for pardon, so for Grace to reform, those evils that have by the late Reverend Synod been witnessed against, and declared to be the provoking procuring causes of the Lords Controversy with</hi> New-England. <hi>As also to pray that the Lord would remember his people in Europe, more especially in the Land of our Fore-Fathers Sepulchres, maintaining his own Cause as the matter may require.</hi>
