            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <p>ON the pleaſant banks of the Garonne, in the province of Gaſcony, ſtood, in the year 1584, the chateau of Monſieur St. Aubert. From its windows were ſeen the paſtoral land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcapes of Guienne and Gaſcony, ſtretching along the river, gay with luxuriant woods and vines, and plantations of olives. To the ſouth, the view was bounded by the majeſtic Pyrenees, whoſe ſummits, veiled in clouds, or exhibiting awful forms, ſeen and loſt again, as the partial vapours rolled along, were ſometimes barren, and gleamed through the blue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

To the north, and to the eaſt; the plains of Guienne and Languedoc were loſt in the miſt of diſtance; on the weſt Gaſcony was bounded by the waters of Biſcay.</p>
                     <p>M. St. Aubert loved to wander, with his wife and daughter, on the margin of the Garonne, and to liſten to the muſic that floated on its waves. He had known life in other forms than
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:029378_0003_0FE07CFF03B4B330"/>
thoſe of paſtoral ſimplicity, having mingled in the gay and in the buſy ſcenes of the world; but the flattering portrait of mankind, which his heart had delineated in early youth, his experience had too ſorrowfully corrected. Yet, amidſt the changing viſions of life, his principles remained unſhaken, his benevolence unchilled; and he retired from the multitude more in <hi>pity</hi> than in anger," to ſcenes of ſimple nature, to the pure delights of literature, and to the exerciſe of domeſtic virtues.</p>
                     <p>He was a deſcendant from the younger branch of an illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious family, and it was deſigned, that the deficiency of his patrimonial wealth ſhould be ſupplied either by a ſplendid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance in marriage, or by ſucceſs in the intrigues of public af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. But St. Aubert had too nice a ſenſe of honour to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the latter hope, and too ſmall a portion of ambition to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice what he called happineſs, to the attainment of wealth. After the death of his father he married a very amiable woman, his equal in birth, and not his ſuperior in fortune. The late Monſieur St. Aubert's liberality, or extravagance, had ſo much involved his affairs, that his ſon found it neceſſary to diſpoſe of a part of the family domain, and, ſome years after his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, he ſold it to Monſieur Queſnel, the brother of his wife, and retired to a ſmall eſtate in Gaſcony, where conjugal feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and parental duties, divided his attention with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>To this ſpot he had been attached from his infancy. He had often made excurſions to it when a boy, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> fruit and cream never failed, had not been obliterated by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding circumſtances. The green paſtures along which he had ſo often bounded in the exultation of health, and youthful freedom—the woods, under whoſe refreſhing ſhade he had firſt indulged that penſive melancholy, which afterwards made a ſtrong feature of his character—the wild walks of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, the river, on whoſe waves he had floated, and the diſtant plains, which ſeemed boundleſs as his early hopes—were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after remembered by St. Aubert but with enthuſiaſm and regret. At length he diſengaged himſelf from the world, and retired hither, to realize the wiſhes of many years.</p>
                     <p>The building, as it then ſtood, was merely a ſummer cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, rendered intereſting to a ſtranger by its neat ſimplicity, or the beauty of the ſurrounding ſcene; and conſiderable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:029378_0003_0FE07CFF03B4B330"/>
were neceſſary to make it a comfortable family reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. St. Aubert felt a kind of affection for every part of the fabric, which he remembered in his youth, and would not ſuffer a ſtone of it to be removed, ſo that the new building, adapted to the ſtyle of the old one, formed with it only a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and elegant reſidence. The taſte of Madame St. Aubert was conſpicuous in its internal finiſhing, where the ſame chaſte ſimplicity was obſervable in the furniture, and in the few orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the apartments, that characteriſed the manners of its inhabitants.</p>
                     <p>The library occupied the weſt ſide of the chateau, and was enriched by a collection of the beſt books in the ancient and modern languages. This room opened upon a grove, which ſtood on the brow of a gentle declivity, that fell towards the river, and the tall trees gave it a melancholy and pleaſing ſhade; while from the windows the eye caught, beneath the ſpreading branches, the gay and luxuriant landſcape ſtretching to the weſt and overlooked on the left by the bold precipices of the Pyrenees. Adjoining the library was a green-houſe, ſtored with ſcarce and beautiful plants; for one of the amuſements of St. Aubert was the ſtudy of botany, and among the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring mountains, which afforded a luxurious feaſt to the mind of the naturaliſt, he often paſſed the day in the purſuits of his favourite ſcience. He was ſometimes accompanied in theſe little excurſions by Madame St. Aubert, and frequently by his daughter; when, with a ſmall oſier baſket to receive plants, and another filled with cold refreſhments, ſuch as the cabin of the ſhepherd did not afford, they wandered away among the moſt romantic and magnificent ſcenes, nor ſuffered the charms of Nature's lowly children to abſtract them from the obſervance of her ſtupendous works. When weary of ſauntering among cliffs that ſeemed ſcarcely acceſſible but to the ſteps of the enthuſiaſt, and where no track appeared on the vegetation, but what the foot of the izard had left; they would ſeek one of thoſe green receſſes, which ſo beautifully adorn the boſom of theſe mountains, where, under the ſhade of the lofty larch, or cedar, they enjoyed their ſimple repaſt, made ſweeter by the waters of the cool ſtream, that crept along the turf, and by the breath of wild flowers and aromatic plants that fringed the rocks, and inlaid the graſs.</p>
                     <p>Adjoining the eaſtern ſide of the green houſe, looking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the plains of Languedoc, was a room which Emily called
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:029378_0004_0FE07D03AA60F7F0"/>
hers, and which contained her books, her drawings, her mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical inſtruments, with ſome favourite birds and plants. Here ſhe uſually exerciſed herſelf in elegant arts, cultivated only becauſe they were congenial to her taſte, and in which native genius, aſſiſted by the inſtructions of Monſieur and Madame St. Aubert, made her an early proficient. The windows of this room were particularly pleaſant; they deſcended to the floor, and, opening upon the little lawn that ſurrounded the houſe, the eye was led between groves of almond, palm-trees, flower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-aſh, and myrtle, to the diſtant-landſcape, where the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronne wandered.</p>
                     <p>The peaſants of this gay climate were often ſeen on an evening, when the day's labour was done, dancing in groups on the margin of the river. Their ſprightly melodies, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonnaire</hi> ſteps, the fanciful figure of their dances, with the taſteful and capricious manner in which the girls adjuſted their ſimple dreſs, gave a character to the ſcene entirely French.</p>
                     <p>The front of the chateau, which, having a ſouthern aſpect, opened upon the grandeur of the mountains, was occupied on the ground floor by a ruſtic hall, and two excellent ſitting rooms. The firſt floor, for the cottage had no ſecond ſtory, was laid out in bed chambers, except one apartment that open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a balcony, and which was generally uſed for a breakfaſt room.</p>
                     <p>In the ſurrounding ground, St. Aubert had made very taſteful improvements; yet, ſuch was his attachment to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects he had remembered from his boyiſh days, that he had in ſome inſtances ſacrificed taſte to ſentiment. There were two old latches that ſhaded the building, and interrupted the proſpect; St. Aubert had ſometimes declared that he believed he ſhould have been weak enough to have wept at their fall. In addition to theſe larches he planted a little grove of beech, pine, and mountain-aſh. On a lofty terrace, formed by the ſwelling bank of the river, roſe a plantation of orange, lemon and palm-trees, whoſe fruit, in the coolneſs of evening, breathed delicious fragrance. With theſe were mingled a few trees of other ſpecies. Here under the ample ſhade of a plane-tree, that ſpread its majeſtic canopy towards the river, St. Aubert loved to ſit in the fine evenings of ſummer, with his wife and children, watching, beneath its foilage, the ſetting ſun, the mild ſplendour of its light fading from the diſtant landſcape,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:029378_0004_0FE07D03AA60F7F0"/>
till the ſhadows of twilight melted its various features into one tint of ſober gray. Here, too, he loved to read, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with Madame St. Aubert; or to play with his children, reſigning himſelf to the influence of thoſe ſweet affections, which are ever attendant on ſimplicity and nature. He has often ſaid, while tears of pleaſure trembled in his eyes, that theſe were moments infinitely more delightful than any paſſed amid the brilliant and tumultuous ſcenes that are courted by the world. His heart was occupied; it had, what can be ſo rarely ſaid, no wiſh for a happineſs beyond what it experienced. The conſciouſneſs of acting right diffuſed a ſerenity over his manners, which nothing elſe could impart to a man of moral perceptions like his, and which refined his ſenſe of every ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding bleſſing.</p>
                     <p>The deepeſt ſhade of twilight did not ſend him from his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite plane-tree. He loved the ſoothing hour, when the laſt tints of light die away; when the ſtars, one by one, tremble through aether, and are reflected on the dark mirror of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; that hour, which, of all others, inſpires the mind with penſive tenderneſs, and often elevates it to ſublime contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. When the moon ſhed her ſoft rays among the foilage, he ſtill lingered, and his paſtoral ſupper of cream and fruits was often ſpread beneath it. Then, on the ſtillneſs of night, came the ſong of the nightingale, breathing ſweetneſs, and awakening melancholy.</p>
                     <p>The firſt interruptions to the happineſs he had known ſince his retirement, were occaſioned by the death <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> his two ſons. He loft them at that age when infantine ſimplicity is ſo faſcin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating; and though, in conſideration of Madame St. Aubert's diſtreſs, he reſtrained the expreſſion of his own, and endeavoured to bear it, as he meant, with philoſophy, he had, in truth, no philoſophy that could render him calm to ſuch loſſes. One daughter was now his only ſurviving child; and, while he watched the unfolding of her infant character, with anxious fondneſs, he endeavoured, with unremitting effort, to counteract thoſe traits in her diſpoſition, which might hereafter lead her from happineſs. She had diſcovered in her early years uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon delicacy of mind, warm affections, and ready benevolence; but with theſe was obſervable a degree of ſuſceptibility too exquiſite to admit of laſting peace. As ſhe advanced in youth, this ſenſibility gave a penſive tone to her ſpirits, and a ſoftneſs to her manner, which added grace to beauty, and rendered her
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:029378_0005_0FE07D0E25CC3178"/>
a very intereſting object to perſons of a congenial diſpoſition. But St. Aubert had too much good ſenſe to prefer a charm to a virtue; and had penetration enough to ſee, that this charm was too dangerous to its poſſeſſor to be allowed the character of a bleſſing. He endeavoured, therefore, to ſtrengthen her mind; to enure her to habits of ſelf-command; to teach her to reject the firſt impulſe of her feelings, and to look, with cool examination, upon the diſappointments he ſometimes threw in her way. While he inſtructed her to reſiſt firſt impreſſions, and to acquire that ſteady dignity of mind, that can alone counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balance the paſſions, and bear us, as far as is compatible with our nature, above the reach of circumſtances, he taught himſelf a leſſon of fortitude; for he was often obliged to witneſs, with ſeeming indifference, the tears and ſtruggles which his caution occaſioned her.</p>
                     <p>In perſon, Emily reſembled her mother; having the ſame elegant ſymmetry of form, the ſame delicacy of features, and the ſame blue eyes, full of tender ſweetneſs. But, lovely as was her perſon, it was the varied expreſſion of her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as converſation awakened the nicer emotions of her mind, that threw ſuch a captivating grace around her:
<q>
                           <l>"Thoſe tend'rer tints, that ſhun the careleſs eye,</l>
                           <l>And, in the world's contagious circle, die."</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>St. Aubert cultivated her underſtanding with the moſt ſcrupulous care. He gave her a general view of the ſciences, and an exact acquaintance with every part of elegant lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature. He taught her Latin and Engliſh, chiefly that ſhe might underſtand the ſublimity of their beſt poets. She diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in her early years of taſte for works of genius; and it was St. Aubert's principle, as well as his inclination, to promote every innocent means of happineſs. "A well-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed mind," he would ſay, "is the beſt ſecurity againſt the contagion of folly and of vice. The vacant mind is ever on the watch for relief, and ready of plunge into error, to eſcape from the languor of idleneſs.

                        </gap>rived from the world within. Thought, and cultivation, are neceſſary equally to the happineſs of a country and a city life; in the firſt they prevent the uneaſy ſenſations of indolence, and afford a ſublime pleaſure in the taſte they create for the beautiful, and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:029378_0005_0FE07D0E25CC3178"/>
the grand; in the latter, they make diſſipation leſs an object of neceſſity, and conſequently of intereſt."</p>
                     <p>It was one of Emily's earlieſt pleaſures to ramble among the ſcenes of nature; nor was it in the ſoft and glowing landſcape that ſhe moſt delighted; ſhe loved more the wild wood-walks, that ſkirted the mountain; and ſtill more the mountain's ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendous receſſes, where the ſilence and grandeur of ſolitude impreſſed a ſacred awe upon her heart, and lifted her thoughts to the GOD OF HEAVEN AND EARTH. In ſcenes like theſe ſhe would often linger alone, wrapt in a melancholy charm, till the laſt gleam of day faded from the weſt; till the lonely ſound of a ſheep-bell, or the diſtant bark of a watch-dog, were all that broke on the ſtillneſs of the evening. Then, the gloom of the woods; the trembling of their leaves, at intervals, in the breeze; the bat, flitting on the twilight; the cottage-lights, now ſeen, and now loſt—were circumſtances that awakened her mind into effort, and led to enthuſiaſm and poetry.</p>
                     <p>Her favourite walk was to a little fiſhing-houſe, belonging to St. Aubert, in a woody-glen, on the margin of a rivulet that deſcended from the Pyrenees, and, after foaming among their rocks, wound its ſilent way beneath the ſhades it reflected.—Above the woods, that ſcreened this glen, roſe the lofty ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the Pyrenees, which often burſt boldly on the eye through the glades below. Sometimes the ſhattered face of a rock only was ſeen, crowned with wild ſhrubs; or a ſhepherd's cabin ſeated on a cliff, overſhadowed by dark cypreſs, or waving aſh. Emerging from the deep receſſes of the woods, the glade opened to the diſtant landſcape, where the rich paſtures and vine-covered ſlopes of Gaſcony gradually declined to the plains; and there, on the winding ſhores of the Garonne, groves, and hamlets, and villas, their outlines ſoftened by diſtance, melted from the eye into one rich harmonious tint.</p>
                     <p>This, too, was the favourite retreat of St. Aubert, to which he frequently withdrew from the fervour of noon, with his wife, his daughter, and his books; or came at the ſweet even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hour to welcome the ſilent duſk, or to liſten for the muſic of the nightingale. Sometimes, too, he brought muſic of his own, and awakened every fairy echo with the tender ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents of his oboe; and often have the tones of Emily's voice drawn ſweetneſs from the waves, over which they trembled.</p>

It was in one of her excurſions to this ſpot, that ſhe obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the following lines written with a pencil on a part of the wainſcot:</p>
                     <lg>
                        <head>SONNET.</head>

                        <l>And who that gazes on that angel-ſmile,</l>
                        <l>Would fear its charm, or think it could beguile!</l>
                     </lg>
                     <p>Theſe lines were not inſcribed to any perſon; Emily there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not apply them to herſelf, though ſhe was undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly the nymph of theſe ſhades. Having glanced round the little circle of her acquaintance without being detained by a ſuſpicion as to whom they could be addreſſed, ſhe was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to reſt in uncertainty; an uncertainty which would have been more painful to an idle mind than it was to hers.—She had no leiſure to ſuffer this circumſtance, trifling at firſt to ſwell into importance by frequent remembrance. The little vanity it had excited (for the incertitude which forbade her to preſume upon having inſpired the ſonnet, forbade her alſo to diſbelieve it) paſſed away, and the incident was diſmiſſed from her thoughts amid her books, her ſtudies, and the exerciſe of ſocial charities.</p>
                     <p>Soon after this period, her anxiety was awakened by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition of her father, who was attacked with a fever; which, though not thought to be of a dangerous kind, gave a ſevere ſhock to his conſtitution. Madame St. Aubert and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily attended him with unremitting care; but his recovery was very ſlow, and as he advanced towards health, Madame ſeemed to decline.</p>

                     <p>To relieve, or perhaps to indulge, the penſive temper of his mind, he bade Emily fetch the lute ſhe knew how to touch with ſuch ſweet pathos. As ſhe drew near the fiſhing-houſe, ſhe was ſurpriſed to hear the tones of the inſtrument, which were awakened by the hand of taſte, and uttered a plaintive air, whoſe exquiſite melody engaged all her attention.

When they reached the fiſhing-houſe ſhe miſſed her bracelet, and recollected that ſhe had taken it from her arm after din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and had left it on the table when ſhe went to walk.

                     <p>They returned penſively to the chateau, Emily muſing on the incident which had juſt occurred; St. Aubert reflecting, with placid gratitude, on the bleſſings he poſſeſſed; and Madame St. Aubert ſomewhat diſturbed and perplexed, by the loſs of her daughter's picture. As they drew near the houſe, they obſerved an unuſual buſtle about it; the ſound of voices was diſtinctly heard, ſervants and horſes were ſeen paſſing between the trees, and, at length, the wheels of a carriage rolled along. Having come within view of the front of the chateau, a landau, with ſmoking horſes, appeared on the little lawn before it. St. Aubert perceived the liveries of his brother-in-law, and in the parlour he found Monſieur and Madame Queſnel already en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. They had left Paris ſome days before, and were on the way to their eſtate, only ten leagues diſtant from La Vallee, and which Monſieur Queſnel had purchaſed ſeveral years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of St. Aubert. This gentleman was the only brother of Madame St. Aubert: but the ties of relationſhip having never been ſtrengthened by congeniality of character, the intercourſe between them had not been frequent. M. Queſnel had lived altogether in the world; his aim had been conſequence; ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour was the object of his taſte; and his addreſs and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of character had carried him forward to the attainment

of almoſt all that he had courted. By a man of ſuch a diſpoſition; it is not ſurpriſing that the virtues of St. Aubert ſhould be overlooked; or that his pure taſte, ſimplicity, and moderated wiſhes, were conſidered as marks of a weak intellect, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> made by perſons whoſe rank and fortune flattered his warmeſt hope. But his ſiſter, who was then addreſſed also by St. Aubert perceived, or thought ſhe perceived, that happineſs and ſplendour were not the ſame, and ſhe did not heſitate to forego the laſt for the attainment of the former. Whether Monſieur Queſnel thought them the ſame, or not, he would readily have ſacrificed his ſiſter's peace to the gratification of his own ambition; and, on her marriage with St. Aubert, expreſſed in private his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of her ſpiritleſs conduct, and of the connection which it permitted. Madame St. Aubert, though ſhe concealed this inſult from her huſband, felt, perhaps, for the firſt time, reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lighted in her heart; and, though a regard for her own dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, united with conſiderations of prudence, reſtrained her expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this reſentment, there was ever after a mild reſerve in her manner towards M. Queſnel, which he both underſtood and felt.</p>
                     <p>In his own marriage he did not follow his ſiſter's example.—His lady was an Italian, and an heireſs by birth; and, by nature and education, was a vain and frivolous woman.</p>
                     <p>They now determined to paſs the night with St. Aubert; and as the chateau was not large enough to accommodate their ſervants, the latter were diſmiſſed to the neighbouring village. When the firſt compliments were over, and the arrangements for the night made, M. Queſnel began the diſplay of his intelligence and his connections; while St. Aubert, who had been long enough in retirement to find theſe topics recommended by their novelty, liſtened, with a degree of patience and attention, which his gueſt miſtook for the humility of wonder. The latter, indeed, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the few feſtivities which the turbulence of that period permitted to the court of Henry the Third, with a minuteneſs, that ſomewhat recompenſed for his oſtentation; but, when he came to ſpeak of the character of the Duke de Joyeuſe, of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret treaty, which he knew to be negociating with the Porte, and of the light in which Henry of Navarre was received, M. St. Aubert recollected enough of his former experience to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that his gueſt could be only of an inferior claſs of politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians;
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:029378_0008_0FE07D276C5292A8"/>
and that, from the importance of the ſubjects upon which he committed himſelf, he could not be of the rank to which he pretended to belong. The opinions delivered by M. Queſnel, were ſuch as St. Aubert forbore to reply to, for he knew that his gueſt had neither humanity to feel, nor diſcernment to perceive what is juſt.</p>
                     <p>Madame Queſnel, meanwhile, was expreſſing to Madame St. Aubert her aſtoniſhment, that ſhe could bear to paſs her life in this remote corner of the world, as ſhe called it, and deſcribing, from a wiſh, probably, of exciting envy, the ſplendour of the balls, banquets, and proceſſions which had juſt been given by the court, in honour of the nuptials of the Duke de Joyeuſe with Margaretta of Lorrain, the ſiſter of the Queen. She deſcribed with equal minuteneſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"It is now twelve years, St. Aubert," ſaid M. Queſnel, "ſince I purchaſed your family eſtate."—"Somewhere there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about," replied St. Aubert, ſuppreſſing a ſigh. "It is near five years ſince I have been there," reſumed Queſnel, "for Paris and its neighbourhood is the only place in the world to live in, and I am ſo immerſed in politics, and have ſo many affairs of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on my hands, that I find it difficult to ſteal away even for a month or two." St. Aubert remaining ſilent, M. Queſnel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded: "I have ſometimes wondered how you, who have lived in the capital, and have been accuſtomed to company, can exiſt elſewhere; eſpecially in ſo remote a country as this, where you can neither hear nor ſee any thing, and can in ſhort be ſcarcely conſcious of life."</p>
                     <p>"I live for my family and myſelf," ſaid St. Aubert; "I am now contented to know only happineſs;—formerly I knew life."</p>
                     <p>"I mean to expend thirty or forty thouſand livres on im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements," ſaid M. Queſnel without ſeeming to notice the words of St. Aubert; "for I deſign, next ſummer, to bring here my friends, the Duke de Durefort and the Marquis Ramont, to paſs a month or two with me." To St. Aubert's, inquiry, as to theſe intended improvements, he replied, that he ſhould take down the old eaſt wing of the chateau, and raiſe upon the ſite a ſet of ſtables. "Then I ſhall build," ſaid he, "<hi>a ſalle à man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> a <hi>ſalon,</hi> a <hi>ſalle au commune,</hi> and a number of rooms for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:029378_0009_0FE07D37153A5B50"/>
for at preſent there is not accommodation for a third part of my own people."</p>
                     <p>"It accommodated our father's houſehold," ſaid St. Aubert, grieved that the old manſion was to be thus improved, "and that was not a ſmall one."</p>
                     <p>"Our notions are ſomewhat enlarged ſince thoſe days," ſaid M. Queſnel;—"what was then thought a decent ſtyle of living would not now be endured." Even the calm St. Aubert bluſhed at theſe words, but his anger ſoon yielded to contempt. "The ground about the chateau is encumbered with trees; I mean to cut ſome of them down."</p>
                     <p>"Cut down the trees too!" ſaid St. Aubert.</p>
                     <p>"Certainly. Why ſhould I not? they interrupt my proſpects. There is a cheſnut which ſpreads its branches before the whole ſouth ſide of the chateau, and which is ſo ancient that they tell me the hollow of its trunk will hold a dozen men. Your enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm will ſcarcely contend that there can be either uſe or beauty, in ſuch a ſapleſs old tree as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

                        </gap>.</p>
                     <p>"Good God!" exclaimed St. Aubert, "you ſurely will not deſtroy that noble cheſnut, which has flouriſhed for centuries, the glory of the eſtate! It was in its maturity when the preſent manſion was built. How often, in my youth, I have climed among its broad branches, and ſat embowered amidſt a world of leaves, while the heavy ſhower has pattered above, and not a rain drop reached me! How often I have ſat with a book in my hand, ſometimes reading, and ſometimes looking out between the branches upon the wide landſcape, and the ſetting ſun, till twilight came, and brought the birds home to their little neſts among the leaves! How often—but pardon me," added St. Aubert, recollecting that he was ſpeaking to a man who could neither comprehend, nor allow for his feelings, "I am talking of times and feelings as old-faſhioned as the taſte that would ſpare that venerable tree."</p>
                     <p>"It will certainly come down," ſaid M. Queſnel; "I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I ſhall plant ſome Lombardy poplars among the clumps of cheſnut, that I ſhall leave of the avenue; Madame Queſnel is partial to the poplar, and tells me how much it adorns a villa of her uncle, not far from Venice."</p>
                     <p>"On the banks of the Brenta, indeed," continued St. Aubert, "where its ſpiry form is intermingled with the pine, and the cypreſs, and where it plays over light and elegant portico<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

"Well, my good ſir," ſaid M. Queſnel, "I will not diſpute with you. You muſt return to Paris before our ideas can at all agree. But <hi>à-propos</hi> of Venice; I have ſome thoughts of going thither, next ſummer; events may call me to take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of that ſame villa, too, which they tell me is the moſt charming that can be imagined. In that caſe I ſhall leave the improvements I mention to another year, and I may, perhaps, be tempted to ſtay ſome time in Italy."</p>
                     <p>Emily was ſomewhat ſurpriſed to hear him talk of being tempted to remain abroad, after he had mentioned his preſence to be ſo neceſſary at Paris, that it was with difficulty he could ſteal away for a month or two; but St. Aubert underſtood the ſelf-importance of the man too well to wonder at this trait; and the poſſibility, that theſe projected improvements might be deferred, gave him a hope, that they might never take place.</p>
                     <p>Before they ſeparated for the night, M. Queſnel deſired to ſpeak with St. Aubert alone, and they retired to another room, where they remained a conſiderable time. The ſubject of this converſation was not known; but whatever it might be, St. Aubert, when he returned to the ſupper room ſeemed much diſturbed, and a ſhade of ſorrow ſometimes fell upon his features that alarmed Madame St. Aubert. When they were alone ſhe was tempted to inquire the occaſion of it, but the delicacy of mind, which had ever appeared in his conduct, reſtrained her: ſhe conſidered that, if St. Aubert wiſhed her to be acquainted with the ſubject of his concern, he would not wait for her inquiries.</p>
                     <p>On the following day, before M. Queſnel departed, he had a ſecond conference with St. Aubert.</p>
                     <p>The gueſts, after dining at the chateau, ſet out in the cool of the day for Epourville, whither they gave him and Madame St. Aubert a preſſing invitation, prompted rather by the vanity of diſplaying their ſplendour, than by a wiſh to make their friends happy.</p>
                     <p>Emily returned, with delight, to the liberty which their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence had reſtrained, to her books, her walks, and the rational converſation of M. and Madame St. Aubert, who ſeemed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice, no leſs, that they were delivered from the ſhackles, which arrogance and frivolity had impoſed.</p>
                     <p>Madame St. Aubert excuſed herſelf from ſharing their uſual evening walk, complaining that ſhe was not quite well, and St. Aubert and Emily went out together.</p>
                     <p>They choſe a walk towards the mountains, intending to viſit ſome old penſioners of St. Aubert, which, from his very moderate

income, he contrived to ſupport, though it is probable M. Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, with his very large one, could not have afforded this.</p>
                     <p>After diſtributing to his penſioners their weekly ſtipends, liſtening patiently to the complaints of ſome, redreſſing the grievances of others, and ſoftening the diſcontents of all, by the look of ſympathy and the ſmile of benevolence, St. Aubert re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home through the woods,

                     <p>"The evening gloom of woods was always delightful to me," ſaid St. Aubert, whoſe mind now experienced the ſweet calm, which reſults from the conſciouſneſs of having done a beneficent action, and which diſpoſes it to receive pleaſure from every ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding object. "I remember that in my youth this gloom uſed to call forth to my fancy a thouſand fairy viſions, and ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic images; and, I own, I am not yet wholly inſenſible of that high enthuſiaſm, which wakes the poet's dream. I can lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, with ſolemn ſteps, under the deep ſhades, ſend forward a transforming eye into the diſtant obſcurity, and liſten with thrilling delight to the myſtic murmuring of the woods."</p>
                     <p>"O my dear father," ſaid Emily, while a ſudden tear ſtarted to her eye, "how exactly you deſcribe what I have felt ſo often, and which I thought nobody had ever felt but myſelf! But hark! here comes the ſweeping ſound over the wood-tops; now it dies away; how ſolemn the ſtillneſs that ſucceed! Now the breeze ſwells again. It is like the voice of ſome ſupernatural being—the voice of the ſpirit of the woods, that watches over them by night. Ah! what light is yonder? But it is gone. And now it gleams again, near the root of that large cheſnut: look, ſir!"</p>
                     <p>"Are you ſuch an admirer of nature," ſaid St. Aubert, "and ſo little acquainted with her appearances as not to know that for the glow-worm? But come," added he gaily, "ſtep a little further, and we ſhall ſee fairies, perhaps; they are often compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions. The glow-worm lends his light, and they in return charm him with muſic, and the dance. Do you ſee nothing tripping yonder?"</p>
                     <p>Emily laughed. "Well my dear ſir," ſaid ſhe, "ſince you allow of this alliance, I may venture to own I have anticipated

                     <p>"Nay," replied St. Aubert, "diſmiſs the <hi>almoſt,</hi> and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture quite; let us hear what vagaries fancy has been playing in your mind. If ſhe has given you one of her ſpells, you need not envy thoſe of the fairies."</p>
                     <p>"If it is ſtrong enough to enchant your judgment, ſir," ſaid Emily, "while I diſcloſe her images, I need <hi>not</hi> envy them.

                     <p>St. Aubert continued ſilent till he reached the chateau, where his wife had retired to her chamber. The languor and dejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that had lately oppreſſed her, and which the exertion called forth by the arrival of her gueſts had ſuſpended, now returned with increaſed effect. On the following day, ſymptoms of fever appeared, and St. Aubert, having ſent for medical advice, learned that her diſorder was a fever of the ſame nature as that, from which he had lately recovered. She had, indeed, taken the infection, during her attendance upon him, and, her conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution being too weak to throw out the diſeaſe immediately, it had lurked in her veins and occaſioned the heavy languor of which ſhe had complained. St. Aubert, whoſe anxiety for his wife overcame every other conſideration, detained the phyſician in his houſe. He remembered the feelings and the reflections that had called a momentary gloom upon his mind, on the day when he had laſt viſited the fiſhing-houſe in company with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame St. Aubert, and he now admitted a preſentiment that this illneſs would be a fatal one. But he effectually concealed this from her and from his daughter, whom he endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:029378_0011_0FE07D45C09D93D8"/>
with hopes that her conſtant aſſiduities would not be unavailing. The phyſician, when aſked by St. Aubert for his opinion of the diſorder, replied, that the event of it depended upon circumſtances which he could not aſcertain. Madame St. Aubert ſeemed to have formed a more decided one; but her eyes only gave hints of this. She frequently fixed them upon her anxious friends with an expreſſion of pity, and of tenderneſs, as if ſhe anticipated the ſorrow that awaited them, and that ſeemed to ſay, it was for their ſakes only, for their ſufferings, that ſhe regretted life. On the ſeventh day, the diſorder was at its criſis. The Phyſician aſſumed a graver manner, which ſhe obſerved, and took occaſion, when her family had once quitted the chamber, to tell him, that ſhe perceived her death was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching. "Do not attempt to deceive me," ſaid ſhe, "I feel that I cannot long ſurvive. I am prepared for the event, I have long, I hope, been preparing for it. Since I have not long to live, do not ſuffer a miſtaken compaſſion to induce you to flatter my family with falſe hopes. If you do their affliction will only be the heavier when it arrives: I will endeavour to teach them reſignation by my example."</p>
                     <p>The phyſician was affected; he promiſed to obey her, and told St. Aubert, ſomewhat abruptly, that there was nothing to expect. The latter was not philoſopher enough to reſtrain his feelings when he received this information; but a conſideration of the increaſed affliction which the obſervance of his grief would occaſion his wife, enabled him, after ſome time, to command himſelf in her preſence. Emily was at firſt overwhelmed with the intelligence; then, deluded by the ſtrength of her wiſhes, a hope ſprung up in her mind that her mother would yet reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and to this ſhe pertinaciouſly adhered almoſt to the laſt hour.</p>
                     <p>The progreſs of this diſorder was marked on the ſide of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame St. Aubert, by patient ſuffering, and ſubjected wiſhes. The compoſure, with which ſhe awaited her death, could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived only from the retroſpect of a life governed, as far as hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man fraility permits, by a conſciouſneſs of being always in the preſence of the Deity, and by the hope of an higher world. But her piety could not entirely ſubdue the grief of parting from thoſe whom ſhe ſo dearly loved. During theſe her laſt hours, ſhe converſed much with St. Aubert and Emily, on the proſpect of futurity, and on other religious topics. The reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſhe expreſſed, with the firm hope of meeting in a future world the friends ſhe left in this, and the effort which ſometimes appeared to conceal her ſorrow at this temporary ſeparation, frequently affected St. Aubert ſo much as to oblige him to leave
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:029378_0012_0FE07D4B96FF5C10"/>
the room. Having indulged his tears awhile, he would dry them and return to his chamber with a countenance compoſed by an endeavour which did but increaſe his grief.</p>
                     <p>Never had Emily felt the importance of the leſſons, which had taught her to reſtrain her ſenſibility, ſo much as in theſe moments, and never had ſhe practiſed them with a triumph ſo complete. But when the laſt was over, ſhe ſunk at once un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the preſſure of her ſorrow, and then perceived that it was hope, as well as fortitude, which had hitherto ſupported her. St. Aubert was for a time too devoid of comfort himſelf to beſtow any on his daughter.</p>

                     <p>MADAME St. Aubert was interred in the neighbouring village church; her huſband and daughter attended her to the grave, followed by a long train of the peaſantry, who were ſincere mourners of this excellent woman.</p>
                     <p>On his return from the funeral, St. Aubert ſhut himſelf in his chamber. When he came forth, it was with a ſerene counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance though pale in ſorrow. He gave orders that his family ſhould attend him. Emily only was abſent; who, overcome with the ſcene ſhe had juſt witneſſed, had retired to her cloſet to weep alone. St. Aubert followed her thither: he took her hand in ſilence, while ſhe continued to weep; and it was ſome moments before he could ſo far command his voice as to ſpeak. It trembled while he ſaid, "My Emily, I am going to prayers with my family; you will join us. We muſt aſk ſupport from above. Where elſe ought we to ſeek it, where elſe can we find it?"</p>
                     <p>Emily checked her tears, and followed her father to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, where the ſervants being aſſembled, St. Aubert read, in a low and ſolemn voice, the evening ſervice, and added a prayer for the ſoul of the departed. During this, his voice often faltered, his tears fell upon the book, and at length he pauſed. But the ſublime emotions of pure devotion gradually elevated his views above this world, and finally brought comfort to his heart.</p>
                     <p>When the ſervice was ended, and the ſervants were withdrawn, he tenderly kiſſed Emily, and ſaid, "I have endeavoured to
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:029378_0012_0FE07D4B96FF5C10"/>
teach you, from your earlieſt youth, the duty of ſelf-command; I have pointed out to you, the great importance of it through life, not only as it preſerves us in the various and dangerous temptations that call us from rectitude and virtue, but as it limits the indulgences which are termed virtuous, yet which, extended beyond a certain boundary, are vicious, for their conſequence is evil. All exceſs is vicious; even that ſorrow, which is amiable in its origin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a ſelfiſh and unjuſt paſſion, if indulged at the expenſe of our duties—by our duties, I mean what we owe to ourſelves, as well as to others. The indulgence of exceſſive grief enervates the mind, and almoſt incapacitates it for again partaking of thoſe various innocent enjoyments which a benevolent God deſigned to be the ſun-ſhine of our lives. My dear Emily recollect and practiſe the precepts I have ſo often given you, and which your own experience has ſo often ſhewn you to be wiſe.</p>
                     <p>Your ſorrow is uſeleſs. Do not receive this as merely a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-place remark, but let reaſon <hi>therefore</hi> reſtrain ſorrow. I would not annihilate your feelings my child, I would only teach you to command them; for whatever may be the evils reſulting from a too ſuſceptible heart, nothing can be hoped from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible one; that, on the other hand, is all vice—vice, of which the deformity is not ſoftened, or the effect conſoled, for, by any ſemblance or poſſibility of good. You know my ſufferings, and are therefore, convinced that mine are not the light words which, on theſe occaſions, are ſo often repeated to deſtroy even the ſour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of honeſt emotion, on which merely diſplay the ſelfiſh oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a falſe philoſophy. I will ſhew my Emily, that I can practiſe what I adviſe. I have ſaid thus much becauſe I cannot bear to ſee you waſting in uſeleſs ſorrow, for want of that reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance which is due from mind; and I have not ſaid it till now, becauſe there is a period when all reaſoning muſt yield to nature; that is paſt: and another, when exceſſive indulgence, having ſunk into habit, weighs down the elaſticity of the ſpirits ſo as to render conqueſt nearly impoſſible; this is to come. You, my Emily, will ſhew that you are willing to avoid it."</p>
                     <p>Emily ſmiled through her tears upon her father: "Dear Sir," ſaid ſhe, and her voice trembled; ſhe would have added, "I will ſhew myſelf worthy of being your daughter; but a mingled emotion of gratitude, affection and grief overcame her. St. Aubert ſuffered her to weep without interruption, and then began to talk on common topics.</p>
                     <p>The firſt perſon who came to condole with St. Aubert was an
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:029378_0013_0FE07D57B655A718"/>
M. Barreaux, an auſtere and ſeemingly unfeeling man. A taſte for botany had introduced them to each other, for they had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently met in their wanderings among the mountains. M. Barreaux had retired from the world, and almoſt from ſociety, to live in a pleaſant chateau, on the ſkirts of the woods, near La Vallee. He alſo had been diſappointed in his opinion of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; but he did not, like St. Aubert, pity and mourn for them; he felt more indignation at their vices, than compaſſion for their weakneſſes.</p>
                     <p>St. Aubert was ſomewhat ſurpriſed to ſee him; for, though he had often preſſed him to come to the chateau, he had never till now accepted the invitation; and now he came without ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or reſerve, entering the parlour as an old friend. The claims of misfortune appeared to have ſoftened down all the ruggedneſs and prejudices of his heart. St. Aubert unhappy, ſeemed to be the ſole idea that occupied his mind. It was in manners, more than in words, that he appeared to ſympathize with his friends: he ſpoke little on the ſubject of their grief; but the minute at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention he gave them, and the modulated voice, and ſoftened look that accompanied it, came from his heart, and ſpoke to theirs.</p>
                     <p>At this melancholy period. St. Aubert was likewiſe viſited by Madame Cheron, his only ſurviving ſiſter, who had been ſome years a widow, and now reſided on her own eſtate near Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe. The intercourſe between them had not been very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent. In her condolements, words were not wanting; ſhe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not the magic of the look that ſpeaks at once to the ſoul, or the voice that ſinks like balm to the heart: but ſhe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured St. Aubert that ſhe ſincerely ſympathized with him, praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the virtues of his late wife, and then offered what ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered to be conſolation. Emily wept unceaſingly while ſhe ſpoke; St. Aubert was tranquil, liſtened to what ſhe ſaid in ſilence, and then turned the diſcourſe upon another ſubject.</p>
                     <p>At parting ſhe preſſed him and her niece to make her an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly viſit. "Change of place will amuſe you," ſaid ſhe, "and it is wrong to give way to grief." St. Aubert acknowledged the truth of theſe words of courſe; but, at the ſame time, felt more reluctant than ever to quit the ſpot which his paſt happineſs had conſecrated. The preſence of his wife had ſanctified every ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding ſcene, and each day, as it gradually ſoftened the acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his ſuffering, aſſiſted the tender enchantment that bound him to home.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="25" facs="unknown:029378_0013_0FE07D57B655A718"/>
But there were calls which muſt be complied with, and of this kind was the viſit he paid to his brother in-law M. Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel. An affair of an intereſting nature made it neceſſary that he ſhould delay this viſit no longer, and, wiſhing to rouſe Emily from her dejection, he took her with him to Epourville.</p>
                     <p>As the carriage entered upon the foreſt that adjoined his pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal domain, his eyes once more caught between the cheſnut avenue, the turreted corners of the chateau. He ſighed to think of what had paſſed ſince he was laſt there, and that it was now the property of a man who neither revered nor valued it. At length he entered the avenue, whoſe lofty trees had ſo often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted him when a boy, and whoſe melancholy ſhade was now ſo congenial with the tone of his ſpirits. Every feature of the edifice, diſtinguiſhed by an air of heavy grandeur, appeared ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively between the branches of the trees—the broad turret, the arched gate-way that led into the courts, the draw bridge, and the dry foſſe which ſurrounded the whole.</p>
                     <p>The ſound of carriage wheels brought a troop of ſervants to the great gate, where St. Aubert alighted, and from which he led Emily into the gothic hall, now no longer hung with the arms and ancient banners of the family. Theſe were diſplaced, and the oak wainſcotting, and beams that croſſed the roof, were painted white. The large table, too, that uſed to ſtretch along the upper end of the hall, where the maſter of the manſion loved to diſplay his hoſpitality, and whence the peal of laughter, and the ſong of conviviality, had ſo often reſounded, was now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; even the benches that had ſurrounded the hall were no longer there. The heavy walls were hung with frivolous orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and every thing that appeared, denoted the falſe taſte and corrupted ſentiments of the preſent owner.</p>
                     <p>St. Aubert followed a gay Pariſian ſervant to a parlour, where ſat Monſ. and Madame Queſnel, who received him with a ſtately politeneſs, and, after a few formal words of condolement, ſeemed to have forgotten that they ever had a ſiſter.</p>
                     <p>Emily felt tears ſwell into her eyes, and then reſentment checked them. St. Aubert, calm and deliberate, preſerved his dignity without aſſuming importance, and Queſnel was depreſſed by his preſence without exactly knowing wherefore.</p>
                     <p>After ſome general converſation, St. Aubert requeſted to ſpeak with him alone; and Emily, being left with Madame Queſnel, ſoon learned that a large party was invited to dine at the chateau, and was compelled to hear that nothing which was paſt and irremediable ought to prevent the feſtivity of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent hour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="26" facs="unknown:029378_0014_0FE07D5D6B3E9268"/>
St. Aubert, when he was told that company were expected, felt a mixed emotion of diſguſt and indignation againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility of Queſnel, which prompted him to return home im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately. But he was informed, that Madame Cheron had been aſked to meet him; and, when he looked at Emily, and conſidered that a time might come when the enmity of her uncle would be prejudicial to her, he determined not to incur it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by conduct which would be reſented as indecorous, by the very perſons who now ſhewed ſo little ſenſe of decorum.</p>
                     <p>Among the viſitors aſſembled at dinner were two Italian gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, of whom one was named Montoni, a diſtant relation of Madame Queſnel, a man about forty, of an uncommonly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome perſon, with features manly and expreſſive, but whoſe countenance exhibited, upon the whole, more of the haughtineſs of command, and the quickneſs of diſcernment, than of any other character.</p>
                     <p>Signor Cavigni, his friend, appeared to be about thirty—his inferior in dignity, but equal to him in penetration of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and ſuperior in inſinuation of manner.</p>
                     <p>Emily was ſhocked by the ſalutation with which Madame Cheron met her father—"Dear brother," ſaid ſhe, "I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to ſee you look ſo very ill; do, pray, have advice!" St. Aubert anſwered with a melancholy ſmile, that he felt himſelf much as uſual; but Emily's fears made her now fancy that her father looked worſe than he really did.</p>
                     <p>Emily would have been amuſed by the new characters ſhe ſaw, and the varied converſation that paſſed during dinner, which was ſerved in a ſtile of ſplendour ſhe had ſeldom ſeen before, had her ſpirits been leſs oppreſſed. Of the gueſts, Signor Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni was lately come from Italy, and he ſpoke of the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which at that period agitated the country; talked of party differences with warmth, and then lamented the probable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of the tumults. His friend ſpoke with equal ardour, of the politics of his country; praiſed the government and proſperity of Venice, and boaſted of its decided ſuperiority over all the other Italian ſtates. He then turned to the ladies, and talked with the ſame eloquence, of Pariſian faſhions, the French opera, and French manners; and on the latter ſubject he did not fail to mingle what is ſo particularly agreeable to French taſte. The flattery was not detected by thoſe to whom it was addreſſed, though its effect in producing ſubmiſſive attention, did not eſcape, his obſervation. When he could diſengage himſelf from the aſſiduities of the other ladies, he ſometimes addreſſed Emily:
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:029378_0014_0FE07D5D6B3E9268"/>
but ſhe knew nothing of Pariſian faſhions, or Pariſian operas; and her modeſty, ſimplicity and correct manners formed a deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded contraſt to thoſe of her female companions.</p>
                     <p>After dinner, St. Aubert ſtole from the room to view once more the old cheſnut which Queſnel talked of cutting down.—As he ſtood under its ſhade, and looked up among its branches, ſtill luxuriant, and ſaw here and there the blue ſky trembling between them; the purſuits and events of his early days crowded faſt to his mind, with the figures and characters of friends, long ſince gone from the earth; and he now felt himſelf to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt an inſulated being, with nobody but his Emily for his heart to turn to.</p>
                     <p>He ſtood loſt amid the ſcenes of years which fancy called up, till the ſucceſſion cloſed with the picture of his dying wife, and he ſtarted away, to forget it, if poſſible, at the ſocial board.</p>
                     <p>St. Aubert ordered his carriage at an early hour, and Emily obſerved, that he was more than uſually ſilent and dejected on the way home; but ſhe conſidered this to be the effect of his viſit to a place which ſpoke ſo eloquently of former times, nor ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that he had a cauſe of grief which he concealed from her.</p>
                     <p>On entering the chateau ſhe felt more depreſſed than ever, for ſhe more than ever miſſed the preſence of that dear parent, who, whenever ſhe had been from home, uſed to welcome her return with ſmiles and fondneſs; now, all was ſilent and forſaken.</p>
                     <p>But what reaſon and effort may fail to do, time effects. Week after week paſſed away, and each, as it paſſed, ſtole ſomething from the harſhneſs of her affliction, till it was mellowed to that tenderneſs which the feeling heart cheriſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, on the contrary, viſibly declined in health; though Emily, who had been ſo conſtantly with him, was almoſt the laſt perſon who obſerved it.

                     <p>For ſome days Emily was occupied in preparations to attend him; and he, by endeavours to diminiſh his expences at home during the journey—a purpoſe which determined him at length to diſmiſs his domeſtics. Emily ſeldom oppoſed her father's wiſhes by queſtions or remonſtrances, or ſhe would now have

aſked why he did not take a ſervant, and have repreſented that his infirm health made one almoſt neceſſary. But when, on the eve of their departure, ſhe found that he had diſmiſſed Jacques, Francis, and Mary, and detained only Thereſa the old houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper, ſhe was extremely ſurpriſed, and ventured to aſk his reaſon for having done ſo. "To ſave expenſes, my dear," he replied—"we are going on an expenſive excurſion."</p>
                     <p>The phyſician had preſcribed the air of Languedoc and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence; and St. Aubert determined, therefore, to travel leiſurely along the ſhores of the Mediterranean, towards Provence.</p>
                     <p>They retired early to their chamber on the night before their departure; but Emily had a few books and other things to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and the clock had ſtruck twelve before ſhe had finiſhed, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> had remembered that ſome of her drawing inſtruments, which ſhe meant to take with her, were in the parlour below. As ſhe went to fetch theſe, ſhe paſſed her father's room, and, perceiving the door half open, concluded that he was in his ſtudy—for, ſince the death of Madame St. Aubert, it had been frequently his cuſtom to riſe from his reſtleſs bed, and go thither to compoſe his mind. When ſhe was below ſtairs ſhe looked into this room, but without finding him; and as ſhe returned to her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſhe tapped at his door, and receiving no anſwer, ſtepped ſoftly in, to be certain whether he was there.</p>
                     <p>The room was dark, but a light glimmered through ſome panes of glaſs that were placed in the upper part of a cloſet door. Emily believed her father to be in the cloſet, and, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed that he was up at ſo late an hour, apprehended he was unwell, and was going to inquire; but, conſidering that her ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den appearance at this hour might alarm him, ſhe removed her light to the ſtaircaſe, and then ſtepped ſoftly to the cloſet. On looking through the panes of glaſs, ſhe ſaw him ſeated at a ſmall table, with papers before him, ſome of which he was reading with deep attention and intereſt, during which he often wept, and ſobbed aloud. Emily, who had come to the door to learn whether her father was ill, was now detained there by a mixture of curioſity and tenderneſs. She could not witneſs his ſorrow, without being anxious to know the ſubject of it; and ſhe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore continued to obſerve him in ſilence, concluding that thoſe papers were letters of her late mother. Preſently he knelt down and with a look ſo ſolemn as ſhe had ſeldom ſeen him aſſume, and which was mingled with a certain wild expreſſion, that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took more of horror than of any other character, he prayed ſilently for a conſiderable time.</p>

When he roſe a ghaſtly paleneſs was on his countenance.—Emily was haſtily retiring; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>St. Aubert gazed earneſtly and tenderly upon this portrait, put it to his lips, and then to his heart, and ſighed with a convulſive force. Emily could ſcarcely believe what ſhe ſaw to be real. She never knew till now that he had a picture of any other lady than her mother, much leſs that he had one which he evidently valued ſo highly; but having looked repeatedly, to be certain that it was not the reſemblance of Madame St. Aubert, ſhe became entirely convinced that it was deſigned for that of ſome other perſon.</p>
                     <p>At length St. Aubert returned the picture into its caſe; and Emily recollecting, that ſhe was intruding upon his private ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, ſoftly withdrew from the chamber.</p>

                     <p>ST. Aubert, inſtead of taking the more direct road, that ran along the feet of the Pyrenees to Languedoc, choſe one that, winding over the heights, afforded more extenſive views and greater variety of romantic ſcenery. He turned a little out of his way to take leave of M. Barreaux, whom he found botaniz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the wood near his chateau, and who, when he was told the purpoſe of St. Aubert's viſit, expreſſed a degree of concern, ſuch as his friend had thought it was ſcarcely poſſible for him to feel on any ſimilar occaſion. They parted with mutual regret:</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="30" facs="unknown:029378_0016_0FE07D71A16FB140"/>
"If any thing could have tempted me from my retirement," ſaid M. Barreaux, "it would have been the pleaſure of accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you on this little tour. I do not often offer compliments <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> you may, therefore believe me, when I ſay, that I ſhall look for your return with impatience."</p>
                     <p>The travellers proceeded on their journey. As they aſcended the heights, St. Aubert often looked back upon his chateau, in the plain below; tender images crowded to his mind; his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy imagination ſuggeſted that he ſhould return no more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> and though he checked this wandering thought, ſtill he continued to look, till the hazineſs of diſtance blended his home with the general landſcape, and St. Aubert ſeemed to

                     </p>
                     <p>He and Emily continued ſunk in muſing ſilence for ſome leagues, from which melancholy reverie Emily firſt awoke, and her young fancy, ſtruck with the grandeur of the objects around, gradually yielded to delightful impreſſions. The road now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended into glens, confined by ſtupendous walls of rock, grey and barren, except where ſhrubs fringed their ſummits, or patches of meagre vegitation tinted their receſſes, in which the wild goat was frequently browſing. And now, the way led to the lofty cliffs, from whence the landſcape was ſeen extending in all its magnificence.</p>
                     <p>Emily could not reſtrain her tranſport as ſhe looked over the pine foreſts of the mountains upon the vaſt plains, that, enriched with woods, towns, Huſhing vines, and plantations of almonds, palms and olives, ſtretched along, till their various colours melted in diſtance into one harmonious hue, that ſeemed to unite earth with heaven. Through the whole of this glorious ſcene the majeſtic Garonne wandered; deſcending from its ſource among the Pyrenees, and winding its blue waves towards the Bay of Biſcay.</p>
                     <p>The ruggedneſs of the unfrequented road often obliged the wanderers to alight from their little carriage, but they thought themſelves amply repaid for this inconvenience by the grandeur of the ſcenes; and, while the muleteer led his animals ſlowly over the broken ground, the travellers had leiſure to linger amid theſe ſolitudes, and to indulge the ſublime reflections, which ſoften, while they elevate, the heart, and fill it with the certainty of a preſent God! Still the enjoyment of St. Aubert was touched with that penſive melancholy, which gives to every object a mellower tint, and breathes a ſacred charm over all around.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="31" facs="unknown:029378_0016_0FE07D71A16FB140"/>
They had provided againſt part of the evil to be encountered from a want of convenient inns, by carrying a ſtock of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in the carriage, ſo that they might take refreſhment on any pleaſant ſpot, in the open air, and paſs the nights wherever they ſhould happen to meet with a comfortable cottage. For the mind, alſo, they had provided, by a work on botany, written by M. Barreaux, and by ſeveral of the Latin and Italian poets; while Emily's pencil enabled her to preſerve ſome of thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations of forms, which charmed her at every ſtep.</p>
                     <p>The lonelineſs of the road, where, only now and then, a pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant was ſeen driving his mule, or ſome mountaineer-children at play among the rocks, heightened the effect of the ſcenery. St. Aubert was ſo much ſtruck with it, that he determined if he could hear of a road, to penetrate further among the mountains, and, bending his way rather more to the ſouth, to emerge into Rouſillon, and coaſt the Mediterranean along part of that country to Languedoc.</p>
                     <p>Soon after mid-day, they reached the ſummit of one of thoſe cliffs, which, bright with the verdure of palm trees, adorn, like gems, the tremendous walls of the rocks, and which overlooked the greater part of Gaſcony, and part of Languedoc. Here was ſhade, and the freſh water of a ſpring, that gliding among the turf, under the trees, thence precipitated itſelf from rock to rock, till its daſhing murmurs were loſt in the abyſs, though its white foam was long ſeen amid the darkneſs of the pines below.</p>
                     <p>This was a ſpot well ſuited for reſt, and the travellers alighted to dine, while the mules were unharneſſed to browſe on the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury herbs that enrich this ſummit.</p>
                     <p>It was ſome time before St. Aubert or Emily could withdraw their attention from the ſurrounding object, ſo as to partake of their little repaſt. Seated in the ſhade of the palms, St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert pointed out to her obſervation the courſe of the rivers, the ſituation of great towns, and the boundaries of provinces, which ſcience, rather than the eye, enabled him to deſcribe. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this occupation, when he had talked awhile he ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly became ſilent, thoughtful, and tears often ſwelled to his eyes, which Emily obſerved, and the ſympathy of her own heart told her their cauſe. The ſcene before them bore ſome reſemblance, though it was on a much grander ſcale, to a fovourite one of the late Madame St. Aubert, within view of the fiſhing-houſe. They both obſerved this, and thought how delighted ſhe would have been with the preſent landſcape, while they knew that her eyes muſt never, never more open upon this world. St. Aubert
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:029378_0017_0FE07D7D77518790"/>
remembered the laſt time of his viſiting that ſpot in company with her, and alſo the mournfully preſaging thoughts which had then ariſen in his mind, and were now, even thus ſoon, realized! The recollections ſubdued him, and he abruptly roſe from his ſeat, and walked away to where no eye could obſerve his grief.</p>
                     <p>When he returned, his countenance had recovered its uſual ſerenity; he took Emily's hand, preſſed it affectionately, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeaking, and ſoon after called to the muleteer, who ſat at a little diſtance concerning a road among the mountains towards Rouſillon. Michael ſaid, there were ſeveral that way; but he did not know how far they extended, or even whether they were paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable; and St. Aubert who did not intend to travel after ſun-ſet, aſked what village they could reach about that time. The mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leteer calculated, that they could eaſily reach Mateau, which was in their preſent road; but that, if they took a road that ſloped more to the ſouth, towards Rouſillon, there was a hamlet, which he thought they could gain before the evening ſhut in.</p>
                     <p>St. Aubert, after ſome heſitation determined to take the latter courſe, and Michael, having finiſhed his meal, and harneſſed his mules, again ſet forward, but ſoon ſtopped; and St. Aubert ſaw him doing homage to a croſs, that ſtood on a rock impending over their way. Having concluded his devotions, he ſmacked his whip in the air, and, in ſpite of the rough road, and the pain of his poor mules, which he had been lately lamenting, rattled, in a full gallop, along the edge of a precipice, which it made the eye dizzy to look down. Emily was terrified almoſt to fainting; and St. Aubert, apprehending ſtill greater danger from ſuddenly ſtopping the driver, was compelled to ſit quietly and truſt his fate to the ſtrength and diſcretion of the mules, who ſeemed to poſſeſs a greater portion of the latter quality than their maſter; for they carried the travellers ſafely into the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, and there ſtopped upon the brink of the rivulet that water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</p>
                     <p>Leaving the ſplendour of extenſive proſpects, they now enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this narrow valley ſcreened by
<q>
                           <l>Rocks on rocks piled, as if by magic ſpell,</l>
                           <l>Here ſcorch'd by lightnings, there with ivy green,</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſcene of barrenneſs was here and there interrupted by the ſpreading branches of the larch and cedar, which threw their gloom over the cliff, or athwart the torrent that rolled in the vale. No living creature appeared, except the izard, ſcram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling among the rocks, and often hanging upon points ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, that fancy ſhrunk from the view of them. This was ſuch
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:029378_0017_0FE07D7D77518790"/>
a ſcene as <hi>Salvator</hi> would have choſen, had he then exiſted, for his canvaſs; St. Aubert, impreſſed by the romantic character of the place, almoſt expected to ſee banditti ſtart from behind ſome projecting rock, and he kept his hand upon the arms with which he always travelled.</p>
                     <p>As they advanced, the valley opened; its ſavage features gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually ſoftened, and, towards evening, they were among heathy mountains, ſtretched in far perſpective, along which the ſolitary ſheep-bell was heard, and the voice of the ſhepherd calling his wandering flocks to the nightly fold. His cabin, partly ſhadowed by the cork-tree and the ilex, which St. Aubert ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to flouriſh in higher reigons of the air than any other trees, except the fur, was all the human habitation that yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared. Along the bottom of this valley the moſt vivid ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure was ſpread; and, in the little hollow receſſes of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, under the ſhade of the oak and cheſnut, herds of cattle were grazing. Groups of them, too, were often ſeen repoſing on the banks of the rivulet, or laving their ſides in the cool ſtream, and ſipping its wave.</p>
                     <p>The ſun was now ſitting upon the valley; its laſt light gleamed upon the water, and heightened the rich yellow and purple tints of the heath and broom, that overſpread the mountains. St. Aubert inquired of Michael the diſtance to the hamlet he had mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but the man could not with certainty tell; and Emily began to fear that he had miſtaken the road. Here was no human be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to aſſiſt, or direct them; they had left the ſhepherd and his cabbin far behind, and the ſcene became ſo obſcured in twilight, that the eye could not follow the diſtant perſpective of the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley in ſearch of a cottage, or a hamlet. A glow of the horizon ſtill marked the weſt, and this was of ſome little uſe to the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers. Michael ſeemed endeavouring to keep up his courage by ſinging; his muſic, however, was not of a kind to diſperſe melancholy; he ſung, in a ſort of chant, one of the moſt diſmal ditties his preſent auditors had ever heard, and St. Aubert at length diſcovered it to be a veſ-per-hymn to his favourite ſaint.</p>
                     <p>They travelled on, ſunk in that thoughtful melancholy, with which twilight and ſolitude impreſs the mind. Michael had now ended his ditty, and nothing was heard but the drowſy mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur of the breeze among the woods, and its light flutter, as it blow freſhly into the carriage. They were at length rouſed by the ſound of fire arms. St. Aubert called to the muleteer to ſtop, and they liſtened. The noiſe was not repeated; but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently they heard a ruſtling among the brakes. St. Aubert drew
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:029378_0018_0FE07D83512501F0"/>
forth a piſtol, and ordered Michael to proceed as faſt as poſſible; who had not long obeyed, before a horn ſounded, that made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> ſaw a young man ſpring from the buſhes into the road, followed by a couple of dogs. The ſtranger was in a hunter's dreſs. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> added to the manly grace of his figure, and aſſiſted the agility of his ſteps.</p>
                     <p>After a moment's heſitation, St. Aubert again ſtopped the carriage, and waited till he came up, that they might inquire concerning the hamlet they were in ſearch of. The ſtranger in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him, that it was only half a league diſtant, that he was going thither himſelf, and would readily ſhew the way. St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert thanked him for the offer, and, pleaſed with his chevalier like air and open countenance, aſked him to take a ſeat in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> carriage; which the ſtranger, with an acknowledgment, declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, adding that he would keep pace with the mules. "But I fear you will be wretchedly accommodated," ſaid he: "the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of theſe mountains are a ſimple people, who are not only without the luxuries of life, but almoſt deſtitute of what in other places are held to be its neceſſaries."</p>
                     <p>"I perceive you are not one of its inhabitants, ſir," ſaid St. Aubert.</p>
                     <p>"No, ſir, I am only a wanderer here."</p>
                     <p>The carriage drove on, and the increaſing duſk made the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers very thankful that they had a guide; the frequent glens, too, that now opened among the mountains, would likewiſe have added to their perplexity. Emily, as ſhe looked up one of theſe, ſaw ſomething at a great diſtance like a bright cloud in the air. "What light is yonder, ſir?" ſaid ſhe. St. Aubert looked, and perceived that it was the ſnowy ſummit of a mountain, ſo much higher than any round it, that it ſtill reflected the ſun's ray's, while thoſe below lay in deep ſhade.</p>
                     <p>At length, village lights were ſeen to twinkle through the duſk, and, ſoon after, ſome cottages were diſcovered in the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, or rather were ſeen by reflection in the ſtream, on whoſe margin they ſtood, and which ſtill gleamed with the evening light.</p>
                     <p>The ſtranger now came up, and St. Aubert, on further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, found not only that there was no inn in the place, but not any ſort of houſe of public reception. The ſtranger, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, offered to walk on, and inquire for a cottage to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date them; for which further civility St. Aubert returned his
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:029378_0018_0FE07D83512501F0"/>
thanks, and ſaid, that, as the village was ſo near, he would alight, and walk with him. Emily followed ſlowly in the carriage.</p>
                     <p>On the way, St. Aubert aſked his companion what ſucceſs he had had in the chaſe. "Not much ſir," he replied, "nor do I aim at it. I am pleaſed with the country, and mean to ſaunter away a few weeks among its ſcenes. My dogs I take with me more for companionſhip than for game. This dreſs, too, gives me an oſtenſible buſineſs, and procures me that reſpect from the people, which would, perhaps, be refuſed to a lonely ſtranger who had no viſible motive for coming among them."</p>
                     <p>"I admire your taſte," ſaid St. Aubert, "and, if I was a younger man, ſhould like to paſs a few weeks in your way ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly. I, too, am a wanderer, but neither my plan nor pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits are axactly like yours—I go in ſearch of health, as much as of amuſement." St Aubert ſighed, and pauſed; and then, ſeeming to recollect himſelf, he reſumed: If I can hear of a tolerable road, that ſhall afford decent accommodation, it is my intention to paſs into Rouſillon, and along the ſea-ſhore to Languedoc. You, ſir, ſeem to be acquainted with the country, and can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, give me information on the ſubject."</p>
                     <p>The ſtranger ſaid that what information he could give was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely at his ſervice; and then mentioned a road rather more to the eaſt, which led to a town, whence it would be eaſy to proceed into Rouſillon.</p>
                     <p>They now arrived at the village, and commenced their ſearch for a cottage, that would afford a night's lodging. In ſeveral, which they entered, ignorance, poverty, and mirth ſeemed equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to prevail; and the owners eyed St. Aubert with a mixture of curioſity and timidity. Nothing like a bed could be found, and he had ceaſed to inquire for one, when Emily joined him, who obſerved the languor of her father's countenance, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, that he had taken a road ſo ill provided with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts neceſſary for an invalid. Other cottages, which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, ſeemed ſomewhat leſs ſavage than the former, conſiſting of two rooms, if ſuch they could be called; the firſt of theſe occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied by mules and pigs, the ſecond by the family, which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally conſiſted of ſix or eight children, with their parents, who ſlept on beds of ſkins and dried beach leaves, ſpread upon a mud floor. Here light was admitted, and ſmoke diſcharged, through an aperture in the roof; and here the ſcent of ſpirits (for the travelling ſmugglers, who haunted the Pyrenees, had made this rude people familiar with the uſe of liquors) was generally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible enough. Emily turned from ſuch ſcenes, and looked at
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:029378_0019_0FE07D93EBFD4AA0"/>
her father with anxious tenderneſs, which the young ſtranger ſeemed to obſerve; for, drawing St. Aubert aſide, he made him an offer of his own bed. "It is a decent one," ſaid he, "when compared with what we have juſt ſeen, yet ſuch as in other circumſtances I ſhould be aſhamed to offer you." St. Aubert acknowledged how much he felt himſelf obliged by this kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but refuſed to accept it till the young ſtranger would take no denial. "Do not give me the pain of knowing, ſir," ſaid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>St. Aubert, at length conſented, that, if this could be do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> the ſtranger had proved himſelf ſo deficient in gallantry, as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter to the repoſe of an infirm man, rather than to that of a very lovely young woman, for he had not once offered the room for Emily. But ſhe thought not of herſelf, and the animated ſmile ſhe gave him, told how much ſhe felt herſelf obliged for the preference of her father.</p>
                     <p>On their way, the ſtranger, whoſe name was Valancourt, ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. This good woman ſeemed very willing to accommodate the ſtrangers, who were ſoon compelled to accept the only two <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> in the place. Eggs and milk were the only food the cottage afforded; but againſt ſcarcity of proviſions St. Aubert had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and he requeſted Valancourt to ſtay, and partake with him of leſs homely fare; an invitation, which was readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and they paſſed an hour in intelligent converſation. St. Aubert was much pleaſed with the manly frankneſs, ſimplicity, and keen ſuſceptibility to the grandeur of nature, which his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> acquaintance diſcovered; and, indeed, he had often been heard to ſay, that, without a certain ſimplicity of heart, this taſte could not exiſt in any ſtrong degree.</p>
                     <p>The converſation was interrupted by a violent uproar without, in which the voice of the muleteer was heard above every other ſound. Valancourt ſtarted from his ſeat, and went to inquire the occaſion; but the diſpute continued ſo long afterwards, that St. Aubert went himſelf, and found Michael quarrelling with the hoſteſs, becauſe ſhe had refuſed to let his mules lie in a little room where he and three of her ſons were to paſs the night.
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:029378_0019_0FE07D93EBFD4AA0"/>
The place was wretched enough, but there was no other for theſe people to ſleep in; and withſomewhat more of delicacy than was uſual among the inhabitants of this wild tract of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſhe perſiſted in refuſing to let the animals have the ſame <hi>bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber</hi> with her children. This was a tender point with the muleteer; his honour was wounded when his mules were treated with diſreſpect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he would have received a blow, perhaps, with more meekneſs. He declared that his beaſts were as honeſt beaſts, and as good beaſts, as any in the whole province; and that they had a right to be well treated wherever they went.—"They are as harmleſs as lambs," ſaid he, "if people don't af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front them. I never knew them behave themſelves amiſs above once or twice in my life, and then they had good reaſon for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo. Once, indeed, they kicked at a boy's leg that lay aſleep in the ſtable, and broke it; but I told them they were out there, and by St. Anthony! I believe they underſtood me, for they never did ſo again."</p>
                     <p>He concluded this eloquent harrangue with proteſting, that they ſhould ſhare with him go where he would.</p>
                     <p>The diſpute was at length ſettled by Valancourt, who drew the hoſteſs aſide, and deſired ſhe would let the muleteer and his beaſts have the place in queſtion to themſelves, while her ſons ſhould have the bed of ſkins deſigned for him, for that he would wrap himſelf in his cloak, and ſleep on the bench by the cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage door. But this ſhe thought it her duty to oppoſe, and ſhe felt it to be her inclination to diſappoint the muleteer. Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court, however, was poſitive, and the tedious affair was at length ſettled.</p>
                     <p>It was late when St. Aubert and Emily retired to their rooms, and Valancourt to his ſtation at the door, which, at this mild ſeaſon, he preferred to a cloſe cabin and a bed of ſkins. St. Aubert was ſomewhat ſurpriſed to find in his room volumes of Homer, Horace and Petrach; but the name of Valancourt, written in them, told him to whom they belonged.</p>

                     <p>ST. Aubert awoke at an early hour, refreſhed by ſleep, and deſirous to ſet forward. He invited the ſtranger to breakfaſt with him; and, talking again of the road, Valancourt ſaid, that, ſome months paſt, he had travelled as far as Beaujeu, which was a town of ſome conſequence on the way to Rouſillon. He recommended it to St. Aubert to take that route, and the latter determined to do ſo.</p>
                     <p>"The road from this hamlet," ſaid Valancourt, "and that to Beaujeu, part at the diſtance of about a league and an half from hence; if you will give me leave, I will direct your muleteer ſo far. I muſt wander ſomewhere, and your company would make this a pleaſanter ramble than any other I could take."</p>
                     <p>St. Aubert thankfully accepted his offer, and they ſet out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the young ſtranger on foot, for he refuſed the invitation of St. Aubert to take a ſeat in his little carriage.</p>
                     <p>The road wound along the feet of the mountains through a paſtoral valley, bright with verdure, and varied with groves of dwarf oak, beech, and ſycamore, under whoſe branches herds of cattle repoſed. The mountain-aſh too, and the weeping birch, often threw their pendant foliage over the ſteeps above, where the ſcanty ſoil ſcarcely concealed their roots, and where their light branches waved to every breeze that fluttered from the mountains.</p>
                     <p>The travellers were frequently met at this early hour, for the ſun had not yet riſen upon the valley, by ſhepherds driving im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe flocks from their folds to ſeed upon the hills. St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert had ſet out thus early, not only that he might enjoy the firſt appearance of ſunriſe, but that he might inhale the firſt pure breath of morning, which above all things is refreſhing to the ſpirits of the invalid. In theſe regions it was particularly ſo,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:029378_0020_0FE07D988E9A6F10"/>
where an abundance of wild flowers and aromatic herbs breathed forth their eſſence on the air.</p>
                     <p>The dawn, which ſoftened the ſcenery with its peculiar grey tint, now diſperſed, and Emily watched the progreſs of the day, firſt trembling on the tops of the higheſt cliffs, then touching them with ſplendid light, while their ſides and the vale below were ſtill wrapt in dewy miſt. Meanwhile the ſullen grey of the eaſtern clouds began to bluſh, then to redden, and then to glow with a thouſand colours, till the golden light darted over all the air, touched the lower points of the mountain's brow, and glanced in long ſloping beams upon the valley and its ſtream. All nature ſeemed to have awakened from death into life; the ſpirit of St. Aubert was renovated. His heart was full; he wept, and his thoughts aſcended to the Great Creator.</p>
                     <p>Emily wiſhed to trip along the turf, ſo green and bright with dew, and to taſte the full delight of that liberty, which the izard ſeemed to enjoy as he bounded along the brow of the cliffs; while Valancourt often ſtopped to ſpeak with the travellers, and with ſocial feeling to point out to them the peculiar objects of his admiration. St. Aubert was pleaſed with him: "Here is the real ingenuouſneſs and ardour of youth," ſaid he to himſelf; "this young man has never been at Paris."</p>
                     <p>He was ſorry when they came to the ſpot where the roads part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his heart took a more affectionate leave of him than is uſual after ſo ſhort an acquaintance. Valancourt talked long by the ſide of the carriage; ſeemed more than once to be going, but ſtill lingered, and appeared to ſearch anxiouſly for topics of converſation to account for his delay. At length he took leave. As he went, St. Aubert obſerved him look with an earneſt and penſive eye at Emily, who bowed to him with a countenance full of timid ſweetneſs, while the carriage drove on. St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, for whatever reaſon, ſoon after looked from the window, and ſaw Valancourt ſtanding upon the bank of the road, reſting on his pike with folded arms, and following the carriage with his eyes. He waved his hand, and Valancourt, ſeeming to awake from his reverie, returned the ſalute, and ſtarted away.</p>
                     <p>The aſpect of the country now began to change, and the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers ſoon found themſelves among mountains covered from their baſe nearly to their ſummits with foreſts of gloomy pine, except where a rock of granite ſhot up from the vale, and loſt its ſnowy top in the clouds. The rivulet, which had hitherto accompanied them, now expanded into a river; and, flowing deeply and ſilently along, reflected, as in a mirror, the blackneſs
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:029378_0021_0FE07DA332775B78"/>
of the impending ſhades. Sometimes a cliff was ſeen lifting i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> bold head above the woods and the vapours, that floated mid-way down the mountains; and ſometimes a face of perpendicular marble roſe from the water's edge, over which the larch threw his gigantic arms, here ſcathed with lightning, and there floating i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> luxuriant foliage.</p>
                     <p>They continued to travel over a rough and unfrequented road, ſeeing now and then at a diſtance the ſolitary ſhepherd, with his dog, ſtalking along the valley, and hearing only the daſhing of torrents, which the woods concealed from the eye, the long ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len murmur of the breeze, as it ſwept over the pines, or the notes of the eagle and the vulture, which were ſeen towering round the beetling cliff.</p>
                     <p>Often, as the carriage moved ſlowly over uneven ground, St. Aubert alighted, and amuſed himſelf with examining the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious plants that grew on the banks of the road, and with which theſe regions abound; while Emily, wrapt in high enthuſiaſm, wandered away under the ſhades, liſtening in deep ſilence to the lonely murmur of the woods.</p>
                     <p>Neither village nor hamlet were ſeen for many leagues; the goat-herd's or the hunter's cabin, perched among the cliffs of the rocks, were the only human habitations that appeared.</p>
                     <p>The travellers again took their dinner in the open air, on a pleaſant ſpot in the valley, under the ſpreading ſhade of cedars; and then ſet forward towards Beaujeu.</p>
                     <p>The road now began to aſcend, and, leaving the pine foreſts behind, wound among rocky precipices. The evening twilight again fell over the ſcene, and the travellers were ignorant how far they might yet be from Beaujeu. St. Aubert, however, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured that the diſtance could not be very great, and comforted himſelf with the proſpect of travelling on a more frequented road after reaching that town, where he deſigned to paſs the night.—Mingled woods, and rocks, and heathy mountains were now ſeen obſcurely through the duſk; but ſoon even theſe imperfect ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges faded in darkneſs. Michael proceeded with caution, for he could ſcarcely diſtinguiſh the road; his mules, however, ſeemed to have more ſagacity, and their ſteps were ſure.</p>
                     <p>On turning the angle of a mountain, a light appeared at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that illuminated the rocks, and the horizon to a great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. It was evidently a large fire, but whether accidental, or otherwiſe, there were no means of knowing. St. Aubert thought it was probably kindled by ſome of the numerous ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditti, that infeſted the Pyrenees, and he became watchful and
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:029378_0021_0FE07DA332775B78"/>
anxious to know whether the road paſſed near this fire. He had arms with him, which on an emergency, might afford ſome protection, though certainly a very unequal one, againſt a band of robbers, ſo deſperate too as thoſe uſually were who haunted theſe wild regions. While many reflections roſe upon his mind, he heard a voice ſhouting from the road behind, and ordering the muleteer to ſtop. St. Aubert bade him proceed as faſt as poſſible; but either Michael or his mules were obſtinate, for they did not quit the old pace. Horſes' feet were now heard; a man rode up to the carriage, ſtill ordering the driver to ſtop; and St. Aubert, who could no longer doubt his purpoſe, was with difficulty able to prepare a piſtol for his defence, when his hand was upon the door of the chaiſe. The man ſtaggered on his horſe, the report of the piſtol was followed by a groan, and St. Aubert's horror may be imagined, when in the next inſtant he thought he heard the faint voice of Valancourt. He now himſelf bade the muleteer ſtop; and pronouncing the name of Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court, was anſwered in a voice, that no longer ſuffered him to doubt. St. Aubert, who inſtantly alighted and went to his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, found him ſtill ſitting on his horſe, but bleeding pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſely, and appearing to be in great pain, though he endeavoured to ſoften the terror of St. Aubert by aſſurances that he was not materially hurt, the wound being only in his arm. St. Aubert, with the muleteer aſſiſted him to diſmount, and he ſat down on the bank of the road, where St. Aubert tried to bind up his arm, but his hands trembled ſo exceſſively that he could not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh it; and, Michael being now gone in purſuit of the horſe, which, on being diſengaged from his rider, had galloped off, he called Emily to his aſſiſtance. Receiving no anſwer, he went to the carriage, and found her ſunk on the ſeat in a fainting fit.—Between the diſtreſs of this circumſtance and that of leaving Valancourt bleeding, he ſcarcely knew what he did; he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, however, to raiſe her, and called to Michael to fetch water from the rivulet that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>owed by the road, but Michael was gone beyond the reach of his voice. Valancourt, who heard theſe calls, and alſo the repeated name of Emily, inſtantly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the ſubject of his diſtreſs; and, almoſt forgetting his own condition, he haſtened to her relief. She was reviving when he reached the carriage; and then, underſtanding that anxiety for him had occaſioned her indiſpoſition, he aſſured her, in a voice that trembled, but not from anguiſh, that his wound was of no conſequence. While he ſaid this St. Aubert turned round, and perceiving that he was ſtill bleeding, the ſubject of
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:029378_0022_0FE07DA8E7EB44D0"/>
his alarm changed again, and he haſtily formed ſome hankerchiefs into a bandage. This ſtopped the effuſion of the blood; but St. Aubert, dreading the conſequence of the wound, inquired re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly how far they were from Beaujeu; when, learning that it was at two leagues diſtance, his diſtreſs increaſed, ſince he knew not how Valancourt, in his preſent ſtate, would bear the motion of the carriage, and perceived that he was already faint from loſs of blood. When he mentioned the ſubject of his anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety, Valancourt entreated that he would not ſuffer himſelf to be thus alarmed on his account, for that he had no doubt he ſhould be able to ſupport himſelf very well; and then he talked of the accident as a ſlight one. The muleteer being now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with Valancourt's horſe, aſſiſted him into the chaiſe; and as Emily was now revived, they moved ſlowed on towards Beaujeu.</p>
                     <p>St. Aubert, when he had recovered from the terror occaſioned him by this accident, expreſſed ſurpriſe on ſeeing Valancourt, who explained his unexpected appearance by ſaying, "You, Sir, renewed my taſte for ſociety; when you had left the hamlet, it did indeed appear a ſolitude. I determined, therefore, ſince my object was merely amuſement, to change the ſcene; and I took this road, becauſe I knew it led through a more romantic tract of mouutains than the ſpot I have left. Beſides," added he, heſitating for an inſtant. "I will own, and why ſhould I not? that I had ſome hope of overtaking you."</p>
                     <p>"And I have made you a very unexpected return for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment," ſaid St. Aubert, who lamented again the raſhneſs which had produced the accident, and explained the cauſe of his late alarm. But Valancourt ſeemed anxious only to remove from the minds of his companions every unpleaſant feeling relative to himſelf; and, for that purpoſe, ſtill ſtruggled againſt a ſenſe of pain, and tried to converſe with gaiety. Emily meanwhile was ſilent, except when Valancourt particularly addreſſed her, and there was at thoſe times a tremulous tone in his voice that ſpoke much.</p>
                     <p>They were now ſo near the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ire, which had long flamed at a diſtance on the blackneſs of night, that it gleamed upon the road, and they could diſtinguiſh figures moving about the blaze. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> way winding ſtill nearer they perceived in the valley one of thoſe numerous bands of gipſies, which at that period par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly haunted the wilds of the Pyrenees, and lived partly by plundering the traveller. Emily looked with ſome degree of terror on the ſavage countenances of theſe people, ſhewn by the
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:029378_0022_0FE07DA8E7EB44D0"/>
fire, which heightened the romantic effect of the ſcenery, as it threw a red duſky gleam upon the rocks and on the foliage of the trees, leaving heavy maſſes of ſhade and regions of obſcurity, which the eye feared to penetrate.</p>
                     <p>They were preparing their ſupper; a large pot ſtood by the fire, over which ſeveral figures were buſy. The blaze diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a rude kind of tent, round which many children and dogs were playing, and the whole formed a picture highly groteſque. The travellers ſaw plainly their danger. Valancourt was ſilent, but laid his hand on one of St. Aubert's piſtols; St. Aubert drew forth another, and Michael was ordered to proceed as faſt as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. They paſſed the place, however, without being attacked; the rovers being probably unprepared for the opportunity, and too buſy about their ſupper to feel much intereſt, at the moment, in any thing beſides.</p>
                     <p>After a league and a half more, paſſed in darkneſs, the travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers arrived at Beaujeu, and drove up to the only inn the place afforded; which, though ſuperior to any they had ſeen ſince they entered the mountains, was bad enough.</p>
                     <p>The ſurgeon of the town was immediately ſent for, if a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon he could be called, who preſcribed for horſes as well as for men, and ſhaved <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

After examining Valancourt's arm, and perceiving that the bullet had paſſed through the fleſh without touching the bone, he dreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and left him with a ſolemn preſcription of quiet, which his patient was not inclined to obey. The delight of eaſe had now ſucceeded to pain; for eaſe may be allowed to aſſume a poſitive quality when contraſted with anguiſh; and, his ſpirits thus re-animated, he wiſhed to partake of the converſation of St. Aubert and Emily, who, releaſed from ſo many apprehenſions, were uncommonly cheerful. Late as it was, however, St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert was obliged to go out with the landlord to buy meat for ſupper; and Emily, who, during this interval, had been abſent as long as ſhe could, upon excuſes of looking to their accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, which ſhe found rather better than ſhe expected, was compelled to return, and converſe with Valancourt alone. They talked of the character of the ſcenes they had paſſed, of the nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural hiſtory of the country, of poetry, and of St. Aubert; a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject on which Emily always ſpoke and liſtened to with peculiar pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>The travellers paſſed an agreeable evening, but St. Aubert was fatigued with his journey; and, as Valancourt ſeemed again ſenſible of pain, they ſeparated ſoon after ſupper.</p>

In the morning St. Aubert found that Valancourt had paſſion a reſtleſs night; that he was feveriſh, and his wound very pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.

                     <p>Valancourt's indiſpoſition detained the travellers at Beaujeu ſeveral days, during which interval St. Aubert had obſerved <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> to him. He ſaw a frank and generous nature, full of ardour highly ſuſceptible of whatever is grand and beautiful, but impet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, wild, and ſomewhat romantic. Valancourt had known little of the world. His perceptions were clear, and his feeling<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> generous action, were expreſſed in terms of equal vehemence. St. Aubert ſometimes ſmiled at his warmth, but ſeldom checked it, and often repeated to himſelf, "This young man has never been at Paris." A ſigh ſometimes followed this ſilent ejaculation. He determined not to leave Valancourt till he ſhould be perfectly recovered; and, as he was now well enough to travel, though not able to manage his horſe, St. Aubert invited him to accompany him for a few days in the carriage. This he the more readily did, ſince he had diſcovered that Valancourt was of a family of the ſame name in Gaſcony, with whoſe reſpectability he was well acquainted. The latter accepted the offer with great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and they again ſet forward among theſe romantic wilds to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Rouſillon.</p>
                     <p>They travelled leiſurely; ſtopping wherever a ſcene uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly grand appeared; frequently alighting to walk to an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inence,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:029378_0023_0FE07DB7CB332448"/>
whither the mules could not go, from which the proſpect opened in greater magnificence; and often ſauntering over hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks covered with lavender, wild thyme, juniper, and tamariſc; and under the ſhades of woods, between whoſe boles they caught the long mountain-viſta, ſublime beyond any thing that Emily had ever imagined.</p>
                     <p>St. Aubert ſometimes amuſed himſelf with botanizing, while Valancourt and Emily ſtrolled on; he pointed out to her notice the objects that particularly charmed him, and reciting beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful paſſages from ſuch of the Latin and Italian poets as he had heard her admire. In the pauſes of converſation, when he thought himſelf not obſerved, he frequently fixed his eyes penſively on her countenance, which expreſſed with ſo much animation the taſte and energy of her mind; and when he ſpoke again, there was a peculiar tenderneſs in the tone of his voice, that defeated any attempt to conceal his ſentiments. By degrees theſe ſilent pauſes became more frequent; till Emily, only, betrayed an anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety to interrupt them; and ſhe, who had been hitherto reſerved, would now talk again, and again, of the woods and the vallies and the mountains, to avoid the danger of ſympathy and ſilence.</p>
                     <p>From Beaujeu the road had conſtantly aſcended, conducting the travellers into the higher regions of the air, where immenſe glaciers exhibited their frozen horrors, and eternal ſnow whiten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſummits of the mountains. They often pauſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template theſe ſtupendous ſcenes, and ſeated on ſome wild cliff, where only the ilex or the larch could flouriſh, looked over dark foreſts of fir, and precipices where human foot had never wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, into the glen—ſo deep, that the thunder of the torrent, which was ſeen to foam along the bottom, was ſcarcely heard to murmur. Over theſe crags roſe others of ſtupendous height, and fantaſtic ſhape; ſome ſhooting into cones; others impending far over their baſe, in huge maſſes of granite, along whoſe broken ridges was often lodged a weight of ſnow, that trembling even to the vibration of a ſound, threatened to bear deſtruction in its courſe to the vale. Around, on every ſide, far as the eye could penetrate, were ſeen only forms of grandeur—the long perſpective of mountain tops, tinged with ethereal blue, or white with ſnow; vallies of ice, and foreſts of gloomy fir. The ſeren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and clearneſs of the air in theſe high regions were particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly delightful to the travellers; it ſeemed to inſpire them with a finer ſpirit, and diffuſed an indeſcribable complacency over their minds. They had no words to expreſs the ſublime emotions they felt. A ſolemn expreſſion characteriſed the feelings of St.

                     <p>As they deſcended, they ſaw at a diſtance, on the right, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>St. Aubert began to look out for the little town he had been directed to by the people of Beaujeu, and where he meant to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> the night; but no habitation yet appeared. Of its diſtance Valancourt could not aſſiſt him to judge, for he had never been ſo far along this chain of Alps before. There was, however, a road to guide them; and there could be little doubt that it was the right one; for, ſince they had left Beaujeu, there had been no variety of tracks to perplex or miſlead.</p>
                     <p>The ſun now gave his laſt light, and St. Aubert bade the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leteer proceed with all poſſible diſpatch. He found, indeed, the
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:029378_0024_0FE07DBC5BB7BBD0"/>
laſſitude of illneſs return upon him, after a day of uncommon fatigue, both of body and mind, and he longed for repoſe. His anxiety was not ſoothed by obſerving a numerous train, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of men, horſes, and loaded mules, winding down the ſteeps of an oppoſite mountain, appearing and diſappearing at intervals among the woods, ſo that its numbers could not be judged of. Something bright, like arms, glanced in the ſetting ray, and the military dreſs was diſtinguiſhable upon the men who were in the van, and on others ſcattered among the troop that followed. As theſe wound into the vale, the rear of the party emerged from the woods, and exhibited a band of ſoldiers. St. Aubert's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions now ſubſided; he had no doubt that the train before him conſiſted of ſmugglers, who, in conveying prohibited goods over the Pyrenees, had been encountered, and conquered by a party of troops.</p>
                     <p>The travellers had lingered ſo long among the ſublimer ſcenes of theſe mountains, that they found themſelves entirely miſtaken in their calculation that they could reach Montigny at ſunſet; but as they wound along the valley, they ſaw, on a rude Alpine bridge, that united two lofty crags of the glen, a group of mountaineer-children, amuſing themſelves with dropping pebbles into a torrent below, and watching the ſtones plunge into the water, that threw up its white ſpray high in the air as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them, and returned a ſullen ſound, which the echoes of the mountains prolonged. Under the bridge was ſeen a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective of the valley, with its cataract deſcending among the rocks, and a cottage on a cliff, overſhadowed with pines. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, that they could not be far from ſome ſmall town. St. Aubert bade the muleteer ſtop, and then called to the children to inquire if he was near Montigny; but the diſtance, and the roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the waters, would not ſuffer his voice to be heard; and the crags adjoining the bridge, were of ſuch tremendous height and ſteepneſs, that to have climbed either would have been ſcarcely practicable to a perſon unacquainted with the aſcent. St. Aubert, therefore, did not waſte more moments in delay. They contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to travel long after twilight had obſcured the road, which was ſo broken, that now thinking it ſafer to walk than to ride, they all alighted. The moon was riſing, but her light was yet too feeble to aſſiſt them. While they ſtepped carefully on, they heard the veſper-bell of a convent. The twilight would not permit them to diſtinguiſh any thing like a building, but the ſounds ſeemed to come from ſome woods, that overhung an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clivity to the right. Valancourt propoſed to go in ſearch of this

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtopped him. "I am very weary," ſaid St. Aubert, "and wiſh for nothing ſo much as for immediate reſt. We will all go to the convent; your good looks would defeat our purpoſe; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>As he ſaid this, he took Emily's arm within his, and telling Michael to wait a while in the road with the carriage, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to aſcend towards the woods, guided by the bell of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. His ſteps were feeble, and Valancourt offered him his arm, which he accepted. The moon now threw a faint light over their path, and, ſoon after, enabled them to diſtinguiſh ſome towers riſing above the tops of the woods. Still following the note of the bell, they entered the ſhade of thoſe woods, lighted only by the moonbeams, that glided down between the leaves and threw a tremulous uncertain gleam upon the ſteep track they were winding. The gloom and the ſilence that prevailed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept when the bell returned upon the air, together with the wildneſs of the ſurrounding ſcene, ſtruck Emily with a degree of fear, which, however, the voice and converſation of Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court ſomewhat repreſſed. When they had been ſometime aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending, St. Aubert complained of wearineſs, and they ſtopped to reſt upon a little green ſummit, where the trees opened, and admitted the moonlight. He ſat down upon the turf, between Emily and Valancourt. The bell had now ceaſed, and the deep repoſe of the ſcene was undiſturbed by any ſound, for the low dull murmur of ſome diſtant torrents might be ſaid to ſoot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Before them, extended the valley they had quitted; its rocks, and woods to the left, juſt ſilvered by the rays, formed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt to the deep ſhadow that involved the oppoſite cliffs, whoſe fringed ſummits only were tipped with light; while the diſtant perſpective of the valley was loſt in the yellow miſt of moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. The travellers ſat for ſometime wrapt in the complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which ſuch ſcenes inſpire.</p>
                     <p>"Theſe ſcenes," ſaid Valancourt, at length, ſoften the heart, like the notes of ſweet muſic, and inſpire that delicious melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly which no perſon, who had felt it once, would reſign for the gayeſt pleaſures. They waken our beſt and pureſt feelings, diſpoſing us to benevolence, pity, and friendſhip. Thoſe whom

I love—I always ſeem to love more in ſuch an hour as this." His voice trembled and he pauſed.</p>
                     <p>St. Aubert was ſilent; Emily perceived a warm tear fall upon the hand he held; ſhe knew the object of his thoughts; hers too had, for ſometime, been occupied by the remembrance of her mother. He ſeemed by an effort to rouſe himſelf. "Yes," ſaid he with a half-ſuppreſſed ſigh, "the memory of thoſe we love—of times for ever paſt! in ſuch an hour as this ſteals upon the mind, like a ſtrain of diſtant muſic in the ſtillneſs of night,—all tender and harmonious as this landſcape, ſleeping in the mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low moonlight." After the pauſe of a moment, St. Aubert ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, "I have always fancied, that I thought with more clearneſs and preciſion, at ſuch an hour than at any other, and that heart muſt be inſenſible in a great degree, that does not ſoften to its influence. But many ſuch there are."</p>
                     <p>Valancourt ſighed.</p>
                     <p>"Are there, indeed, many ſuch?" ſaid Emily.</p>
                     <p>"A few years hence, my Emily," replied St. Aubert, "and you may ſmile at the recollection of that queſtion—if you do not weep to it. But come, I am ſomewhat refreſhed, let us proceed."</p>
                     <p>Having emerged from the woods, that ſaw, upon a turfy hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock above, the convent of which they were in ſearch. An high wall that ſurrounded it, led them to an ancient gate, at which they knocked; and the poor monk who opened it, conducted them into a ſmall adjoining room, where he deſired they would wait while he informed the ſuperior of their requeſt. In this interval, ſeveral friars came in ſeparately to look at them; and at length the firſt monk returned, and they followed him to a room, where the ſuperior was ſitting in an armchair, with a large folio volume, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

He received them with courteſy, though he did not riſe from his ſeat; and, having aſked them a few queſtions, granted their requeſt. After a ſhort converſation, formal and ſolemn on the part of the ſuperior, they withdrew to the apartment where they were to ſup, and Valancourt, whom one of the inferior fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars civilly deſired to accompany, went to ſeek Michael and his mules. They had not deſcended half way down the cliffs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they heard the voice of the muleteer echoing ſar and wide. Sometimes her called on St. Aubert, and ſometimes on Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court; who having at length, convinced him that he had noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to fear either for himſelf, or his maſter; and having diſpoſed of him, for the night, in a cottage on the ſkirts of the woods, returned to ſup with his friends, on ſuch ſober fare as the monks
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:029378_0026_0FE07DCFA5F7ECC8"/>
thought it prudent to ſet before them. While St. Aubert was too much indiſpoſed to ſhare it, Emily, in her anxiety for her father, forgot herſelf; and Valancourt, ſilent and thoughtful, yet never inattentive to them, appeared particularly ſolicitous to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate and relieve St. Aubert, who often obſerved, while his daughter was preſſing him to eat, or adjuſting the pillow ſhe had placed in the back of his armchair, that Valancourt fixed on her a look of penſive tenderneſs, which he was not diſpleaſed to underſtand.</p>
                     <p>They ſeparated at an early hour, and retired to their reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive apartments. Emily was ſhown to hers by a nun of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, whom ſhe was glad to diſmiſs, for her heart was melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and her attention ſo much abſtracted, that converſation with a ſtranger was painful. She thought her father daily declining and attributed his preſent fatigue more to the feeble ſtate of his frame, than to the difficulty of the journey. A train of gloomy ideas haunted her mind, till ſhe fell aſleep.</p>
                     <p>In about two hours after, ſhe was awakened by the chiming of a bell, and then heard quick ſteps paſs along the gallery, into which her chamber opened. She was ſo little accuſtomed to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> her fears, ever alive for her father, ſuggeſted that he was very ill, and ſhe roſe in haſte to go to him. Having pauſed, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to let the perſons in the gallery paſs before ſhe opened her door, her thoughts, in the mean time, recovered from the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſleep, and ſhe underſtood that the bell was the call of the monks to prayers. It had now ceaſed, and, all being again ſtill, ſhe forbore to go to St. Aubert's room. Her mind was not diſpoſed for immediate ſleep, and the moonlight, that ſhone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her chamber, invited her to open the caſement, and look out upon the country.</p>
                     <p>It was a ſtill and beautiful night, the ſky was unobſcured by any cloud, and ſcarce a leaf of the woods beneath trembled in the air. As ſhe liſtened, the midnight hymn of the monks roſe ſoftly from a chapel, that ſtood on one of the lower cliffs, an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrain, that ſeemed to aſcend through the ſilence of night to heaven, and her thoughts aſcended with it. From the conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of his works, her mind aroſe to the adoration of the Deity, in his goodneſs and power; wherever ſhe turned her view, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the ſleeping earth, or to the vaſt regions of ſpace, glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with worlds beyond the reach of human thought, the ſublim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of God, and the majeſty of his preſence appeared. Her eyes were filled with tears of awful love and admiration; and
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:029378_0026_0FE07DCFA5F7ECC8"/>
ſhe felt that pure devotion, ſuperior to all the diſtinctions of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſyſtem, which lifts the ſoul above this world, and ſeems to expand it into a nobler nature; ſuch devotion as can, perhaps, only be experienced, when the mind, reſcued, for a moment, from the humbleneſs of earthly conſiderations, aſpires to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate His power in the ſublimity of His works, and His goodneſs in the infinity of His bleſſings.</p>

                     <p>ST. Aubert, ſufficiently reſtored by a night's repoſe to purſue his journey, ſet out in the morning, with his family and Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court, for Rouſillon, which he hoped to reach before night-fall. The ſcenes, through which they now paſſed, were as wild and romantic, as any they had yet obſerved, with this difference, that beauty, every now and then, ſoftened the landſcape into ſmiles. Little woody receſſes appeared among the mountains, covered with bright verdure and flowers; or a paſtoral valley opened its graſſy boſom in the ſhade of the cliffs, with flocks and herds loitering along the banks of a rivulet, that refreſhed it with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual green. St. Aubert could not repent the having taken this fatiguing road, though he was this day, alſo, frequently
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:029378_0027_0FE07DE01E9B8E58"/>
obliged to alight, to walk along the rugged precipice, and to climb the ſteep and flinty mountain. The wonderful ſublimity and variety of the proſpects repaid him for all this, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm, with which they were viewed by his young companions, heightened his own, and awakened a remembrance of all the delightful emotions of his early days, when the ſublime charms of nature were firſt unveiled to him. He found great pleaſure in converſing with Valancourt, and in liſtening to his ingenuous remarks. The fire and ſimplicity of his manners ſeemed to render him a characteriſtic figure in the ſcenes around them; and St. Aubert diſcovered in his ſentiments, the juſtneſs and the dignity of an elevated mind, unbiaſſed by intercourſe with the world. He perceived, that his opinions were formed, rather than imbibed; were more the reſult of thought, than of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Of the world he ſeemed to know nothing; for he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved well of all mankind, and this opinion gave him the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected image of his own heart.</p>
                     <p>St. Aubert, as he ſometimes lingered to examine the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> plants in his path, often looked forward with pleaſure to Emily and Valancourt, as they ſtrolled on together; he, with a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of animated delight, pointing to her attention ſome gran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> feature of the ſcene; and ſhe, liſtening and obſerving with a look of tender ſeriouſneſs, that ſpoke the elevation of her mind. They appeared like two lovers who had never ſtrayed beyond theſe their native mountains; whoſe ſituation had ſecluded them from the frivolities of common life, whoſe ideas were ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and grand, like the landſcapes among which they moved, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ho knew no other happineſs, than in the union of pure and affectionate hearts. St. Aubert ſmiled, and ſighed at the ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic picture of felicity his fancy drew; and ſighed again to think, that nature and ſimplicity were ſo little known to the world, as that their pleaſures were thought romantic.</p>
                     <p>"The world," ſaid he, purſuing this train of thought, "ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules a paſſion which it ſeldom feels; its ſcenes, and its intereſt, diſtract the mind, deprave the taſte, corrupt the heart, and love cannot exiſt in a heart that has loſt the meek dignity of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. Virtue and taſte are nearly the ſame, for virtue is little more than active taſte, and the moſt delicate affections of each combine in real love. How then are we to look for love in great cities, where ſelfiſhneſs, diſſipation and inſincerity ſupply the place of tenderneſs, ſimplicity and truth?"</p>
                     <p>It was near noon, when the travellers, having arrived at a piece of ſteep and dangerous road, alighted to walk. The road
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:029378_0027_0FE07DE01E9B8E58"/>
wound up an aſcent, that was clothed with wood, and, inſtead of following the carriage, they entered the refreſhing ſhade. A dewy coolneſs was diffuſed upon the air, which, with the bright verdure of turf, that grew under the trees, the mingled fragrance of flowers and of balm, thyme, and lavender, that enriched it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the grandeur of the pines, beech, and cheſnuts, that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowed them, rendered this a moſt delicious retreat. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, the thick foliage excluded all view of the country; at others, it admitted ſome partial catches of the diſtant ſcenery, which gave hints to the imagination to picture landſcapes more intereſting, more impreſſive, than any that had been preſented to the eye. The wanderers often lingered to indulge in theſe rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eries of fancy.</p>
                     <p>The pauſes of ſilence, ſuch as had formerly interrupted the converſations of Valancourt and Emily, were more frequent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day than ever. Valancourt often dropped ſuddenly from the moſt animating vivacity into fits of deep muſing, and there was, ſometimes, an unaffected melancholy in his ſmile, which Emily could not avoid underſtanding, for her heart was intereſted in the ſentiment it ſpoke.</p>
                     <p>St. Aubert was refreſhed by the ſhades, and they continued to ſaunter under them, following, as nearly as they could gueſs, the direction of the road, till they perceived that they had to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally loſt it. They had continued near the brow of the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice, allured by the ſcenery it exhibited, while the road wound far away over the cliff above. Valancourt called loudly to Michael, but heard no voice, except his own, echoing among the rocks, and his various efforts to regain the road were equally unſucceſsful. While they were thus circumſtanced, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a ſhepherd's cabin, between the boles of the trees at ſome diſtance, and Valancourt bounded on firſt to aſk aſſiſtance.—When he reached it, he ſaw only two little children, at play, on the turf before the door. He looked into the hut, but no perſon was there, and the eldeſt of the boys told him that their father was with his flocks, and their mother was gone down into the vale, but would be back preſently. As he ſtood, conſidering what was further to be done, on a ſudden he heard Michael's voice roaring forth moſt manfully among the cliffs above, till he made their echoes ring. Valancourt immediately anſwered the call, and he endeavoured to make his way through the thicket that clothed the ſteeps, following the direction of the ſound. After much ſtruggle over brambles and precipices, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>reached Michael, and at length prevailed with him to be ſilent, and to
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:029378_0028_0FE07DE4C2D47108"/>
liſten to him. The road was at a conſiderable diſtance from the ſpot where St. Aubert and Emily were; the carriage could not eaſily return to the entrance of the wood, and, ſince it would be very fatiguing for St. Aubert to climb the long and ſteep road to the place where it now ſtood, Valancourt was anxious to find a more eaſy aſcent, by the way he had himſelf paſſed.</p>
                     <p>Meanwhile St. Aubert and Emily approached the cottage, and reſted themſelves on a ruſtic bench, faſtened between two pines, which overſhadowed it, till Valancourt, whoſe ſteps they had obſerved, ſhould return.</p>
                     <p>The eldeſt of the children deſiſted from his play, and ſtood ſtill to obſerve the ſtrangers, while the younger continued his little gambols, and teaſed his brother to join in them. St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert looked with pleaſure upon this picture of infantine ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, till it brought to his remembrance his own boys, whom he had loſt about the age of theſe, and their lamented mother; and he ſunk into a thoughtfulneſs, which Emily obſerving, ſhe immediately began to ſing one of thoſe ſimple and lively airs he was ſo fond of, and which ſhe knew how to give with the moſt captivating ſweetneſs. St. Aubert ſmiled on her through his tears, took her hand and preſſed it affectionately, and then tried to diſſipate the melancloly reflections that lingered in his mind.</p>
                     <p>While ſhe ſung, Valancourt approached, who was unwilling to interrupt her, and pauſed at a little diſtance to liſten. When ſhe had concluded, he joined the party, and told them, that he had found Michael, as well as a way, by which he thought they could aſcend the cliff to the carriage. He pointed to the woody ſteeps above, which St. Aubert ſurveyed with an anxious eye. He was already wearied by his walk, and this aſcent was formidable to him. He thought, however, it would be leſs toil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome than the long and broken road, and he determined to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it; but Emily ever watchful of his eaſe, propoſing that he ſhould reſt, and dine before they proceeded further, Valancourt went to the carriage for the refreſhments depoſited there.</p>
                     <p>On his return, he propoſed removing a little higher up the mountain, to where the woods opened upon a grand and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive proſpect; and thither they were preparing to go, when they ſaw a young woman join the children, and careſs and weep over them.</p>
                     <p>The travellers, intereſted by her diſtreſs, ſtopped to obſerve her. She took the youngeſt of the children in her arms, and, perceiving the ſtrangers, haſtily dried her tears, and proceeded to the cottage. St. Aubert, on inquiring the occaſion of her ſorrow,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:029378_0028_0FE07DE4C2D47108"/>
learned that her huſband, who was a ſhepherd, and lived here in the ſummer months to watch over the flocks he led to feed upon theſe mountains, had loſt, on the preceding night, his little all. A gang of gipſies, who had for ſometime infeſted the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, had driven away ſeveral of his maſter's ſheep. "Jacques," added the ſhepherd's wife, "had ſaved a little money, and had bought a few ſheep with it, and now they muſt go to his maſter for thoſe that are ſtolen; and what is worſe than all, his maſter, when he comes to know how it is, will truſt him no longer with the care of his flocks, for he is a hard man! and then what is to become of our children!"</p>
                     <p>The innocent countenance of the woman, and the ſimplicity of her manner in relating her grievance, inclined St. Aubert to believe her ſtory; and Valancourt, convinced that it was true, aſked eagerly what was the value of the ſtolen ſheep; on hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which, he turned away with a look of diſappointment. St. Aubert put ſome money into her hand, Emily too gave ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from her little purſe, and they walked towards the cliff; but Valancourt lingered behind, and ſpoke to the ſhepherd's wife, who was now weeping with gratitude and ſurpriſe. He inquired how much money was yet wanting to replace the ſtolen ſheep, and found, that it was a ſum very little ſhort of all he had about him. He was perplexed and diſtreſſed. "This ſum then," ſaid he to himſelf, "would make this poor family completely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py—it is in my power to give it—to make them completely happy! But what is to become of me? how ſhall I contrive to reach home with the little money that will remain?" For a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he ſtood, unwilling to forego the luxury of raiſing a family from ruin to happineſs, yet conſidering the difficulties of purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his journey with ſo ſmall a ſum as would be left.</p>
                     <p>While he was in this ſtate of perplexity, the ſhepherd himſelf appeared: his children ran to meet him; he took one of them in his arms, and, with the other clinging to his coat, came forward with a loitering ſtep. His forlorn and melancholy look determined Valancourt at once; he threw down all the money he had, except a few louis, and bounded away after St. Aubert and Emily, who were proceeding ſlowly up the ſteep. Valancourt had ſeldom felt his heart ſo light as at this moment; his gay ſpirits danced with pleaſure; every object around him appeared more intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or beautiful, than before. St. Aubert obſerved the uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vivacity of his countenance: "What has pleaſed you ſo much?" ſaid he. "O what a lovely day," replied Valancourt, "how brightly the ſun ſhines, how pure is this air, what enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:029378_0029_0FE07DF1F0936CC0"/>
ſcenery!" "It is indeed enchanting," ſaid St. Aubert, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

On the other ſide of the valley, immediately oppoſite to the ſpot where the travellers reſted, a rocky paſs opened toward Gaſcony. Here no ſign of cultivation appeared. The rocks of granite, that ſcreened the glen, roſe abruptly from their baſe, and ſtretched their barren points to the clouds, unvaried with woods, and uncheered even by a hunter's cabin. Sometimes, indeed, a gigantic larch threw its long ſhade over the precipice, and here and there a cliff reared on its brow a monumental croſs, to tell the traveller the fate of him who had ventured thither before. This ſpot ſeemed the very haunt of banditti; and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily, as ſhe looked down upon it, almoſt expected to ſee them ſtealing out from ſome hollow cave to look for their prey. Soon after an object not leſs terrific ſtruck her,—a gibbet ſtanding on a point of rock near the entrance of the paſs, and immediately over one of the croſſes ſhe had before obſerved. Theſe were hieroglyphics that told a plain and dreadful ſtory. She forbore to point it out to St. Aubert, but it threw a gloom over her ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and made her anxious to haſten forward, that they might with certainty reach Rouſillon before night-fall. It was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, however, that St. Aubert ſhould take ſome refreſhment, and, ſeating themſelves on the ſhort dry turf, they opened the baſket of proviſions, while

                     <p>St. Aubert was revived by reſt, and by the ſerene air of this ſummit; and Valancourt was ſo charmed with all around, and with the converſation of his companions, that he ſeemed to have forgotten he had any further to go. Having concluded their ſimple repaſt, they gave a long farewell look to the ſcene, and again began to aſcend. St. Aubert rejoiced when he reached the carriage, which Emily entered with him; but Valancourt, willing to take a more extenſive view of the enchanting country, into which they were about to deſcend, than he could do from a carriage, looſened his dogs, and once more bounded with them along the banks of the road. He often quitted it for points that promiſed a wider proſpect, and the ſlow pace, at which the

It was St. Aubert's plan to proceed, on the morrow, to the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Mediterranean, and travel along its ſhores into Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc; and Valancourt, ſince he was now nearly recovered, and had no longer a pretence for continuing with his new friends, reſolved to leave them here. St. Aubert, who was much pleaſed with him, invited him to go further, but did not repeat the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation, and Valancourt had reſolution enough to forego the temptation of accepting it, that he might prove himſelf not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the favour. On the following morning, therefore, they were to part, St. Aubert to purſue his way to Languedoc, and Valancourt to explore new ſcenes among the mountains, on his return home. During this evening he was often ſilent and thoughtful; St. Aubert's manner towards him was affectionate, though grave, and Emily was ſerious, though ſhe made frequent efforts to appear cheerful. After one of the moſt melancholy evenings they had yet paſſed together, they ſeparated for the night.</p>

                     <p>IN the morning, Valancourt breakfaſted with St. Aubert and Emily, neither of whom ſeemed much refreſhed by ſleep. The languor of illneſs ſtill hung over St. Aubert, and to Emily's fears his diſorder appeared to be increaſing faſt upon him. She watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his looks with anxious affection, and their expreſſion was always faithfully reflected in her own.</p>
                     <p>At the commencement of their acquaintance, Valancourt had made known his name and family. St. Aubert was not a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to either, for the family eſtates, which were now in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of an elder brother of Valancourt, were little more than twenty miles diſtant from La Vallee, and he had ſometimes met the elder Valancourt on viſits in the neighbourhood. This knowledge had made him more willingly receive his preſent companion; for, though his countenance and manners would have won him the acquaintance of St. Aubert, who was very apt to truſt to the intelligence of his own eyes, with reſpect to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances, he would not have accepted theſe, as ſufficient intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions to that of his daughter.</p>
                     <p>The breakfaſt was almoſt as ſilent as the ſupper of the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Valancourt ſtarted from his chair, and went to the window; it was indeed the carriage, and he returned to his ſeat without ſpeaking. The moment was now come when they muſt part. St. Aubert told Valancourt, that he hoped he would never paſs La Vallee without favouring him with a viſit; and Valancourt, eagerly thanking him, aſſured him that he never would; as he ſaid which he looked timidly at Emily, who tried to ſmile away the ſeriouſneſs of her ſpirits. They paſſed a few minutes in intereſting converſation, and St. Aubert then led the

She ſought for one, in which Valancourt had been reading the day before, and hoped for the pleaſure of retracing a page, over which the eyes of a beloved friend had lately paſſed, of dwelling on the paſſages, which he had admired, and of permitting them to ſpeak to her in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of his own mind, and to bring himſelf to her preſence. On ſearching for the book, ſhe could find it no where, but in its ſtead perceived a volume of Petrarch's poems, that had belonged to Valancourt, whoſe name was written in it, and from which he had frequently read paſſages to her, with all the pathetic expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that characterized the feelings of the author. She heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in believing, what would have been ſufficiently apparent to almoſt any other perſon, that he had purpoſely left this book, inſtead of the one ſhe had loſt, and that love had prompted the exchange; but, having opened it with impatient pleaſure, and obſerved the lines of his pencil drawn along the various paſſages he had read aloud, and under others more deſcriptive of delicate tenderneſs than he had dared to truſt his voice with, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction came, at length, to her mind.

                     <p>St. Aubert could not reply: he caught Emily to his boſom, their tears flowed together, but—they were not tears of ſorrow.

St. Aubert and Emily ſaw the buſy groups, caught the joyous ſong, that was wafted on the breeze, and anticipated, with apparent pleaſure, their next day's journey over this gay region. He deſigned, however, ſtill to wind along the ſea-ſhore. To return home immediately was partly his wiſh, but from this he was with-held by a deſire to lengthen the pleaſure, which the journey gave his daughter, and to try the effect of the ſea air on his own diſorder.</p>
                     <p>On the following day, therefore, they recommenced their journey through Languedoc, winding the ſhores of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean; the Pyrenees ſtill forming the magnificent back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground of their proſpects, while on their right was the ocean, and, on their left, wide extended plains melting into the blue horizon. St. Aubert was pleaſed, and converſed much with Emily, yet his cheerfulneſs was ſometimes artificial, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a ſhade of melancholy would ſteal upon his countenance, and betray him. This was ſoon chaſed away by Emily's ſmile; who ſmiled, however, with an aching heart, for ſhe ſaw that his misfortunes preyed upon his mind, and upon his enfeebled frame.</p>

ſet off, and continued on the full gallop, till St. Aubert, almoſt fainting, called to him to ſtop. Emily looked anxiouſly from the window, and ſaw a peaſant walking at ſome little diſtance on the road, for whom they waited, till he came up, when he was aſked, if there was any houſe in the neighbourhood that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated travellers. He replied, that he knew of none. "There is a chateau, indeed, among thoſe woods on the right," added he, "but I believe it receives nobody, and I cannot ſhew you the way, for I am almoſt a ſtranger here." St. Aubert was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to aſk him ſome further queſtion concerning the chateau, but the man abruptly paſſed on. After ſome conſideration, he ordered Michael to proceed ſlowly to the woods. Every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment now deepened the twilight, and increaſed the difficulty of finding the road. Another peaſant ſoon after paſſed.—"Which is the way to the chateau in the woods?" cried Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael.</p>
                     <p>"The chateau in the woods!" exclaimed the peaſant, "Do you mean that with the turret yonder?"</p>
                     <p>"I don't know as for the turret, as you call it," ſaid Michael, "I mean that white piece of a building, that we ſee at a diſtance there, among the trees."</p>
                     <p>"Yes, that is the turret; why, who are you, that you are going thither?" ſaid the man with ſurpriſe.</p>
                     <p>St. Aubert, on hearing this odd queſtion, and obſerving the peculiar tone in which it was delivered, looked out from the carriage. "We are travellers," ſaid he, "who are in ſearch of a houſe of accommodation for the night; is there any hereabout?"</p>
                     <p>"None, Monſieur, unleſs you have a mind to try your luck yonder," replied the peaſant, pointing to the woods, "but I would not adviſe you to go there."</p>
                     <p>"To whom does the chateau belong?"</p>
                     <p>"I ſcarcely know myſelf, Monſieur,"</p>
                     <p>"It is uninhabited, them," "No, not uninhabited; the ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard and houſekeeper are there, I believe."</p>
                     <p>On hearing this, St. Aubert determined to proceed to the chateau, and riſque the refuſal of being accommodated for the night; he therefore deſired the countryman would ſhew Michael the way, and bade him expect reward for his trouble. The man was for a moment ſilent, and then ſaid, that he was going on other buſineſs, but that the road could not be miſſed, if they went up an avenue to the right, to which he pointed. St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert was going to ſpeak, but the peaſant wiſhed him good night, and walked on.</p>

The carriage now moved towards the avenue, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

There was ſomething ſo gloomy and deſolate in the appearance of this ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, and its lonely ſilence, that Emily almoſt ſhuddered as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> paſſed along; and recollecting the manner in which the peaſant had mentioned the chateau, ſhe gave a myſterious meaning to his words, ſuch as ſhe had not ſuſpected when he uttered them. Theſe apprehenſions, however, ſhe tried to check, conſidering that they were probably the effect of a melancholy imagination which her father's ſituation, and a conſideration of her own cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, had made ſenſible to every impreſſion.</p>
                     <p>They paſſed ſlowly on, for they were now almoſt in darkneſs, which, together with the unevenneſs of the ground, and the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent roots of old trees, that ſhot up above the ſoil, made it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to proceed with caution. On a ſudden Michael ſtopped the carriage; and, as St. Aubert looked from the window <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> inquire the cauſe, he perceived a figure at ſome diſtance moving up the avenue. The duſk would not permit him to diſtinguiſh what it was, but he bade Michael go on.</p>
                     <p>"This ſeems a ſtrange wild place," ſaid Michael; "there is no houſe hereabout, don't your honour think we had better turn back?"</p>
                     <p>"Go a little further, and if we ſee no houſe then, we will return to the road," replied St. Aubert.</p>
                     <p>Michael proceeded with reluctance, and the extreme ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his pace made St. Aubert look again from the window to haſten him, when again he ſaw the ſame figure. He was ſomewhat ſtartled: probably the gloomineſs of the ſpot made him more liable to alarm than uſual; however this might be, he now ſtopped Michael, and bade him call to the perſon in the avenue.</p>
                     <p>"Pleaſe your honour, he may be a robber," ſaid Michael "It does not pleaſe me," replied St. Aubert, who could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear ſmiling at the ſimplicity of his phraſe, "and we will, therefore, return to the road, for I ſee no probability of meeting here with what we ſeek."</p>
                     <p>Michael turned about immediately, and was retracing his way with alacrity, when a voice was heard from among <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> on the left. It was not the voice of command or diſtreſs, but a deep hallow tone, which ſeemed to be ſcarcely human. The man whipped his mules till they went as faſt as poſſible, regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:029378_0034_0FE07E1BED82E100"/>
of the darkneſs, the broken ground, and the necks, of the whole party, nor once ſtopped till he reached the gate, which opened from the avenue into the high road, where he went into a more moderate pace.</p>
                     <p>"I am very ill," ſaid St. Aubert, taking his daughter's hand. "You are worſe then, ſir!" ſaid Emily extremely alarmed by his manner, "you are worſe, and here is no aſſiſtance. Good God! what is to be done!" He leaned his head on her ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, while ſhe endeavoured to ſupport him with her arm, and Michael was again ordered to ſtop. When the rattling of the wheels had ceaſed, muſic was heard on the air; it was to Emily the voice of Hope. "Oh! we are near ſome human habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!" ſaid ſhe, "help may ſoon be had."</p>
                     <p>She liſtened anxiouſly; the ſounds were diſtant, and ſeemed to come from a remote part of the woods that bordered the road; and, as ſhe looked towards the ſpot whence they iſſued, ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the faint moonlight ſomething like a chateau. It was difficult, however, to reach this; St. Aubert was now too ill to bear the motion of the carriage; Michael could not quit his mules; and Emily, who ſtill ſupported her father, feared to leave him, and alſo feared to venture alone to ſuch a diſtance, ſhe knew not whither, or to whom. Something, however it was neceſſary to determine upon immediately; St. Aubert there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore told Michael to proceed ſlowly; but they had not gone far, when he fainted, and the carriage was again ſtopped. He lay quite ſenſeleſs.—"My dear, dear father," cried Emily in great agony, and who began to fear that he was dying, "ſpeak, if it is only one word to let me hear the ſound of your voice!" But no voice ſpoke in reply. In an agony of terror ſhe bade Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael bring water from the rivulet, that flowed along the road; and, having received ſome in the man's hat, with trembling hands ſhe ſprinkled it over her father's face, which as the moon's rays now fell upon it, ſeemed to bear the impreſſion of death. Every emotion of ſelfiſh fear now gave way to a ſtronger influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and committing St. Aubert to the care of Michael, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to go far from his mules, ſhe ſtepped from the carriage in ſearch of the chateau ſhe had ſeen at a diſtance. It was a ſtill moonlight night, and the muſic which yet ſounded on the air, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected her ſteps from the high road, up a ſhadowy lane that led to the woods. Her mind was for ſometime ſo entirely occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by anxiety and terror for her father, that ſhe felt none for herſelf, till the deepening gloom of the overhanging foliage, which now wholly excluded the moonlight, and the wildneſs of the
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:029378_0035_0FE07E28DF1D9B50"/>
place, recalled her to a ſenſe of her adventurous ſituation. The muſic had ceaſed, and ſhe had no guide but chance. For a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhe pauſed in terrified perplexity, till a ſenſe of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's condition again overcoming every conſideration for herſelf, ſhe proceeded. The lane terminated in the woods, but ſhe look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed round in vain for a houſe, or a human being, and as vainly liſtened for a ſound to guide her. She hurried on, however, not knowing whither, avoiding the receſſes of the woods, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to keep along their margin, till a rude kind of avenue which opened upon a moonlight ſpot arreſted her attention. The wildneſs of this avenue brought to her recollection the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> ruſhed forward, with a feeble hope of obtaining aſſiſtance from the people in the woods. Her heart beat with fearful expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as ſhe drew near the ſpot whence the voices iſſued, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> often ſtartled, when her ſteps diſturbed the fallen leaves. The ſounds led her towards the moonlight glade ſhe had before noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; at a little diſtance from which ſhe ſtopped, and ſaw, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the boles of the trees, a ſmall circular level of green turf, ſurrounded by the woods, on which appeared a group of figures. On drawing nearer, ſhe diſtinguiſhed theſe, by their dreſs, to be peaſants, and perceived ſeveral cottages ſcattered round the edge of the woods, which waved loftily over this ſpot. While ſhe gazed, and endeavoured to overcome the apprehenſions that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held her ſteps, ſeveral peaſant girls came out of a cottage; muſic inſtantly ſtruck up, and the dance began. It was the joyous mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic of the vintage! the ſame ſhe had before heard upon the air. Her heart occupied with terror for her father, could not feel the contraſt which this gay ſcene offered to her own diſtreſs; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> ſtepped haſtily forward towards a group of elder peaſants who were ſeated at the door of a cottage, and, having explained her ſituation, entreated their aſſiſtance. Several of them roſe with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and offering any ſervice in their power, followed Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:029378_0035_0FE07E28DF1D9B50"/>
who ſeemed to move on the wind, as faſt as they could to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the road.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe reached the carriage, ſhe found St. Aubert reſtored to animation. On the recovery of his ſenſes, having heard from Michael whither his daughter was gone, anxiety for her over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came every regard for himſelf, and he had ſent him in ſearch of her. He was, however, ſtill languid, and, perceiving himſelf unable to travel much further, he renewed his inquiries for an inn, and concerning the chateau in the woods. "The chateau can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not accommodate you, ſir," ſaid a venerable peaſant who had followed Emily from the woods, "it is ſcarcely inhabited; but, if you will do me the honour to viſit my cottage, you ſhall be welcome to the beſt bed it affords."</p>
                     <p>St. Aubert was himſelf a Frenchman; he, therefore, was not ſurpriſed at French courteſy; but, ill as he was, he felt the value of the offer enhanced by the manner which accompanied it. He had too much delicacy to apologize, or to appear to heſitate about availing himſelf of the peaſant's hoſpitality, but immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately accepted it with the ſame frankneſs with which it was offered.</p>
                     <p>The carriage again moved ſlowly on; Michael following the peaſants up the lane, which Emily had juſt quitted, till they came to the moonlight glade. St. Aubert's ſpirits were ſo far reſtored by the courteſy of his hoſt, and the near proſpect of repoſe, that he looked with a ſweet complacency upon the moonlight ſcene, ſurrounded by the ſhadowy woods, through which, here and there, an opening admitted the ſtreaming ſplendour, diſcovering a cottage, or a ſparkling rivulet. He liſtened, with no painful emotion, to the merry notes of the guitar and tamborine; and, though tears came to his eyes, when he ſaw the <hi>debonnaire</hi> dance of the peaſants, they were not merely tears of mournful regret. With Emily it was otherwiſe; immediate terror for her father had now ſubſided into a gentle melancholy, which every note of joy, by awakening compariſon, ſerved to heighten.</p>
                     <p>The dance ceaſed on the approach of the carriage, which was a phenomenon in theſe ſequeſtered woods, and the peaſantry flocked round it with eager curioſity. On learning that it brought a ſick ſtranger, ſeveral girls ran acroſs the turf, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with wine and baſkets of grapes, which they preſented to the travellers, each with kind contention, preſſing for a prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. At length the carriage ſtopped at a neat cottage, and his venerable conductor, having aſſiſted St. Aubert to alight, led him and Emily to a ſmall inner room, illuminated only by moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams, which the open caſement admitted. St. Aubert, rejoic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:029378_0036_0FE07E2D7763D328"/>
in reſt, ſeated himſelf in an armchair, and his ſenſes were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed by the cool and balmy air, that lightly waved the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowering honeyſuckles, and wafted their ſweet breath into the apartment. His hoſt, who was called La Voiſin, quitted the room, but ſoon returned with fruits, cream, and all the paſtoral luxury his cottage afforded; having ſet down which, with a ſmile of unfeigned welcome, he retired behind the chair of his gueſt. St. Aubert inſiſted on his taking a ſeat at the table, and, when the fruit had allayed the fever of his palate, and he found himſelf ſomewhat revived, he began to converſe with his hoſt, who communicated ſeveral particulars concerning himſelf and his family, which were intereſting, becauſe they were ſpoke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Emily ſat by her father, holding his hand, and, while ſhe liſtened to the old man, her heart ſwelled with the affectionate ſympathy he deſcribed, and her tears fell to the mournful conſideration, that death would probably ſoon deprive her of the deareſt bleſſing ſhe then poſſeſſed. The ſoft moonlight of an autumnal evening, and the diſtant muſic, which now ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a plaintive ſtrain, aided the melancholy of her mind. The old man continued to talk of his family, and St. Aubert remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſilent. "I have only one daughter living," ſaid La Voiſin, "but ſhe is happily married, and is every thing to me. What I loſt my wife," he added with a ſigh, "I came to live with Agnes, and her family; ſhe has ſeveral children, who are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"My good friend," ſaid St. Aubert, while his voice trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, "I hope you will long live ſurrounded by them."</p>
                     <p>"Ah, ſir! at my age I muſt not expect that!" replied the old man, and he pauſed: "I can ſcarcely wiſh it," he reſumed, "for I truſt that whenever I die, I ſhall go to heaven, where my poor wife is gone before me. I can ſometimes almoſt fancy I ſee her of a ſtill moonlight night walking among theſe ſhades ſhe loved ſo well. Do you believe, monſieur, that we ſhall be permitted to reviſit the earth after we have quitted the body?"</p>
                     <p>Emily could no longer ſtifle the anguiſh of her heart; her tears fell faſt upon her father's hand, which ſhe yet held. He made an effort to ſpeak, and at length ſaid in a low voice, "I hope we ſhall be permitted to look down on thoſe we have left on the earth, but I can only hope it. Futurity is much veiled from

our eyes, and faith and hope are our only guides concerning it. We are not enjoined to believe, that diſembodied ſpirits watch over the friends they have loved, but we may innocently hope it. It as a hope which I will never reſign," continued he, while he wiped the tears from his daughter's eyes, "it will ſweeten the bitter moments of death!" Tears fell ſlowly on his cheeks; La Voiſin, wept too, and there was a pauſe of ſilence. Then, La Voiſin, renewing the ſubject, ſaid, "But you believe, ſir, that we ſhall meet in another world the relations we have loved in this; I muſt believe this." "Then do believe it," replied St. Aubert, "ſevere, indeed, would be the pangs of ſeparation, if we believed it to be eternal. Look up, my dear Emily, we ſhall meet again!" He lifted his eyes towards heaven, and a gleam of moonlight, which fell upon his countenance, diſcovered peace and reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſtealing on the lines of ſorrow.</p>
                     <p>La Voiſin felt that he had purſued the ſubject too far, and he dropped it, ſaying, "We are in darkneſs, I forgot to bring a light."</p>
                     <p>"No," ſaid St. Aubert, "this is a light I love. Sit down, my good friend. Emily, my love, I find myſelf better than I have been all day; this air refreſhes me. I can enjoy this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quil hour, and that muſic, which floats ſo ſweetly at a diſtance. Let me ſee you ſmile. Who touches that guitar ſo taſtefully? are there two inſtruments, or is it an echo I hear?"</p>
                     <p>"It is an echo, monſieur, I fancy. That guitar is often heard at night, when all is ſtill, but nobody knows who touches it, and it is ſometimes accompanied by a voice ſo ſweet, and ſo ſad, one would almoſt think the woods were haunted." "They cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly are haunted," ſaid St. Aubert, with a ſmile, "but I believe it is by mortals." "I have ſometimes heard it at midnight, when I could not ſleep," rejoined La Voiſin, not ſeeming to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice this remark, "almoſt under my window, and I never heard any muſic like it. It has often made me think of my poor wife till I cried. I have ſometimes got up to the window to look if I could ſee any body, but as ſoon as I opened the caſement all was huſhed, and nobody to be ſeen; and I have liſtened, and liſtened till I have been ſo timorous, that even the trembling of the leaves in the breeze has made me ſtart. "They ſay it often comes to warn people of their death, but I have heard it theſe many years, and outlived the warning."</p>
                     <p>Emily, though ſhe ſmiled at the mention of this ridiculous ſuperſtition, could not, in the preſent tone of her ſpirits, wholly reſiſt its contagion.</p>

As his hoſt repeated his laſt ſentence, a groan eſcaped from St. Aubert, and then, as if anxious to prevent it from being noticed, he haſtily aſked La Voiſin how long he had lived in this neighbourhood. "Almoſt from my childhood, ſir," replied his hoſt.</p>
                     <p>"You remember the late marchioneſs, then?" ſaid St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert in an altered voice.</p>

"But, my dear ſir," ſaid Emily, anxious to diſſipate his thoughts, "you forget that repoſe is neceſſary to you. If our kind hoſt will give me leave I will prepare your bed, for I know how you like it to be made." St. Aubert, recollecting himſelf, and ſmiling affectionately, deſired ſhe would not add to her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue by that attention; and La Voiſin, whoſe conſideration for his gueſt had been ſuſpended by the intereſts, which his own narrative had recalled, now ſtarted from his ſeat, and, apologiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for not having called Agnes from the green, hurried out of the room.</p>

Emily, though ſhe alſo deſired to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, was grieved at her father's ſudden wiſh to do ſo, which ſhe thought indicated a greater degree of indiſpoſition than he would acknowledge. St. Aubert now retired to reſt, and Emily to her little chamber, but not to immediate repoſe. Her thoughts returned to the late converſation, concerning the ſtate of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted ſpirits; a ſubject, at this time, particularly affecting to her, when ſhe had every reaſon to believe, that her dear father would ere long be numbered with them. She leaned penſively on the little open caſement, and in deep thought fixed her eyes on the heaven, whoſe blue unclouded concave was ſtudded thick with ſtars, the worlds, perhaps, of ſpirits, unſphered of mortal mould. As her eyes wandered along the boundleſs aether, her thoughts roſe, as before, towards the ſublimity of the Deity, and to the contemplation of futurity. No buſy note of this world interrupted the courſe of her mind; the merry dance had ceaſed, and every cottager had retired to his home. The ſtill air ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſcarcely to breathe upon the woods, and, now and then, the diſtant ſound of a ſolitary ſheep-bell, or of a cloſing caſement, was all that broke on ſilence.

                     <p>No muſic, however, ſtole on the ſilence of the night, and Emily, perceiving the lateneſs of the hour, returned to a ſcene of fatigue, remembered that ſhe was to riſe early in the morning, and withdrew from the window to repoſe.</p>

                     <p>Emily now heard perſons moving below in the cottage, and preſently the voice of Michael, who was talking to his mules, as he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

She led him down ſtairs to the little parlour, in which they had ſupped on the preceding night, where they found a neat breakfaſt ſet out, while the hoſt and his daughter waited to bid them good morrow.</p>
                     <p>"I envy you this cottage, my good friends," ſaid St. Aubert, as he met them, it is ſo pleaſant, ſo quiet, and ſo neat; and

                     <p>La Voiſin bowed gratefully, and replied, with the gallantry of a Frenchman, "Our cottage may be envied, ſir, ſince you and Mademoiſelle have honoured it with your preſence," St. Aubert gave him a friendly ſmile for his compliment, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> down to a table, ſpread with cream, fruit, new cheeſe, butter, and coffee. Emily, who had obſerved her father with attention, and thought he looked very ill, endeavoured to perſuade him to defer travelling till the afternoon; but he ſeemed very anxious to be at home, and his anxiety he expreſſed repeatedly, and wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> an earneſtneſs that was unuſual with him. He now ſaid, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> found himſelf as well as he had been of late, and that he could bear travelling better in the cool hour of the morning, than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

But, while he was talking with his venerable hoſt, and thanking him for his kind attentions, Emily obſerved his countenance change, and, before ſhe could reach him, he fell back in his chair. In a few moments he recovered from the ſudden faintneſs that had come over him, but felt ſo ill, that he perceived himſelf unable to ſet out, and, having remained a little while, ſtruggling againſt the preſſure of indiſpoſition, he begged he might be helped up ſtairs to bed. This requeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed all the terror which Emily had ſuffered on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding evening; but, though ſcarcely able to ſupport herſelf, under the ſudden ſhock it gave her, ſhe tried to conceal her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions from St. Aubert, and gave her trembling arm to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him to the door of his chamber.</p>
                     <p>When he was once more in bed, he deſired that Emily who was then weeping in her own room, might be called; and, as ſhe came, he waved his hand for every other perſon to quit the apartment. When they were alone, he held out his hand to her, and fixed his eyes upon her countenance, with an expreſſion ſo full of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and grief, that all her fortitude forſook her, and ſhe burſt into an agony of tears. St. Aubert ſeemed ſtruggling to acquire firmneſs, but was ſtill unable to ſpeak; he could only preſs her hand, and check the tears that ſtood trembling in his eyes. At length, he commanded his voice, "My dear child," ſaid he, trying to ſmile through his anguiſh, "my dear Emily," and pauſed again. He raiſed his eyes to heaven, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

the art. Alas! I would at this moment conceal it from you, but that it would be moſt cruel to deceive you. It cannot be long before we muſt part; let us talk of it, that our thoughts and our prayers may prepare us to bear it." His voice faltered, while Emily, ſtill weeping, preſſed his hand cloſe to her heart, which ſwelled with a convulſive ſigh, but ſhe could not look up.</p>
                     <p>"Let me not waſte theſe moments." ſaid St. Aubert, recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering himſelf. "I have much to ſay. There is a circumſtance of ſolemn conſequence, which I have to mention, and a ſolemn promiſe to obtain from you; when this is done I ſhall be eaſier. You have obſerved, my dear, how anxious I am to reach home, but know not all my reaſons for this. Liſten to what I am going to ſay. Yet ſtay—before I ſay more give me this promiſe, a promiſe made to your dying father!"—St. Aubert was interrupted; Emily, ſtruck by his laſt words, as if for the firſt time, with a conviction of his immediate danger, raiſed her head; her tears ſtopped, and gazing at him for a moment with an expreſſion of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> anguiſh, a flight convulſion ſeized her, and ſhe ſunk ſenſeleſs in her chair. St. Aubert's cries brought La Voiſin and his daughter to the room, and they adminiſtered every means in their power to reſtore her, but, for a conſiderable time, without effect. When ſhe recovered, St. Aubert was ſo exhauſted by the ſcene he had witneſſed, that it was many minutes before he had ſtrength to ſpeak; he was, however, ſomewhat revived by a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial which Emily gave him; and, being again alone with her, he exerted himſelf to tranquillize her ſpirits, and to offer her all the comfort of which her ſituation admitted. She threw herſelf into his arms, wept on his neck, and grief made her ſo inſenſible to all he ſaid, that he ceaſed to offer the alleviations, which he himſelf could not, at this moment, feel, and mingled his ſilent tears with hers. Recalled, at length, to a ſenſe of duty, ſhe tried to ſpare her father from farther view of her ſuffering; and, quitting his embrace, dried her tears, and ſaid ſomething, which ſhe meant for conſolation. "My dear Emily," replied St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, "my dear child, we muſt look up with humble confidence to that Being, who, has protected and comforted us in every dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and in every affliction we have known; to whoſe eye ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery moment of our lives has been expoſed; he will not, he does not forſake us now.

to thoſe, who can confide in an all-powerful God. Had my life been ſpared now, after a very few years, in the courſe of nature, I muſt have reſigned it; old age, with all its train of infirmity, its privations and its ſorrows, would have been mine; and then, at laſt, death would have come, and called forth the tears you now ſhed. Rather, my child, rejoice, that I am ſaved from ſuch ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, and that I am permitted to die with a mind unimpaired, and, ſenſible of the comforts of faith and of reſignation." St. Aubert pauſed, fatigued with ſpeaking. Emily again endeavoured to aſſume an air of compoſure; and, in replying to what he had ſaid, tried to ſooth him with a belief, that he had not ſpoken in vain.</p>
                     <p>When he had repoſed a while, he reſumed the converſation. "Let me return," ſaid he, "to a ſubject which is very near my heart. I ſaid I had a ſolemn promiſe to receive from you; let me receive it now, before I explain the chief circumſtance which it concerns; there are others, of which your peace requires that you ſhould reſt in ignorance. Promiſe, then, that you will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form exactly what I ſhall enjoin."</p>
                     <p>Emily, awed by the earneſt ſolemnity of his manner, dried her tears, that had begun again to flow, in ſpite of her efforts to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them; and, looking eloquently at St. Aubert, bound her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to do whatever he ſhould require by a vow, at which ſhe ſhud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, yet knew not why.</p>
                     <p>He proceeded: "I know you too well, my Emily, to believe, that you would break any promiſe, much leſs one thus ſolemnly given; your aſſurance gives me peace, and the obſervance of it is of the utmoſt importance to your tranquillity. Hear, then, what I am going to tell you. The cloſet, which adjoins my chamber at La Vallee, has a ſliding board in the floor. You will know it by a remarkable knot in the wood, and by its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the next board, except one, to the wainſcot, which fronts the door. At the diſtance of about a yard from that end, nearer the window, you will perceive a line acroſs it, as if the plank had been joined; the way to open it is this: Preſs your foot upon the line, the end of the board will then ſink, and you may ſlide it with eaſe beneath the other. Below, you will ſee a hollow place." St. Aubert pauſed for breath, and Emily ſat fixed in deep attention. "Do you underſtand theſe directions my dear?" ſaid he. Emily, though ſcarcely able to ſpeak, aſſured him that ſhe did.</p>
                     <p>"When you return home, then," he added with a deep ſigh—</p>
                     <p>At the mention of her return home, all the melancholy cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, that muſt attend this return, ruſhed upon her fancy;
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:029378_0041_0FE069645D9063D0"/>
ſhe burſt into convulſive grief, and St. Aubert himſelf, affected beyond the reſiſtance of the fortitude which he had, at firſt, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned, wept with her. After ſome moments, he compoſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. "My dear child," ſaid he, "be comforted. When I am gone, you will not be forſaken—I leave you only in the more immediate care of that Providence, which has never yet forſaken me. Do not afflict me with this exceſs of grief; rather teach me by your example to bear my own." He ſtopped again, and Emily, the more ſhe endeavoured to reſtrain her emotion, found it the leſs poſſible to do ſo.</p>
                     <p>St. Aubert, who now ſpoke with pain, reſumed the ſubject. "That cloſet, my dear,—when you return home, go to it; and, beneath the board I have deſcribed, you will find a packet of written papers. Attend to me now, for the promiſe you have given particularly relates to what I ſhall direct. Theſe papers you muſt burn—and, ſolemnly I command you, <hi>without exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ining them."</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Emily's ſurpriſe, for a moment, overcame her grief, and ſhe ventured to aſk, why this muſt be? St. Aubert replied, that, if it had been right for him to explain his reaſons, her late promiſe would have been unneceſſarily exacted. It is ſufficient for you, my love, to have a deep ſenſe of the importance of obſerving me in this inſtance." St. Aubert proceeded. "Under that board you will alſo find about two hundred louis d'ors, wrapped in a ſilk purſe; indeed, it was to ſecure whatever mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey might be in the chateau, that this ſecret place was contrived, at a time when the province was overrun by troops of men, who took advantage of the tumults, and became plunderers.</p>
                     <p>"But I have yet another promiſe to receive from you, which is—that you will never, whatever may be your future circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, <hi>ſell</hi> the chateau." St. Aubert even enjoined her, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe might marry, to make it an article in the contract, that the chateau ſhould always be hers. He then gave her a more minute account of his preſent circumſtances than he had yet done, adding, "The two hundred louis, with what money you will now find in my purſe, is all the ready money I have to leave you. I have told you how I am circumſtanced with M. Motteville, at Paris. Ah, my child! I leave you poor—but not deſtitute," he added after a long pauſe. Emily could make no reply to any thing he now ſaid, but knelt at the bed ſide, with her face upon the quilt, weeping over the hand ſhe held there.</p>
                     <p>After this converſation, the mind of St. Aubert appeared to be much more at eaſe; but exhauſted by the effort of ſpeaking,

The old man and his daughter came; they both wept, and knelt with Emily round the bed, while the holy father read in a ſolemn voice <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"Above all, my dear Emily," ſaid he, "do not indulge in the pride of fine feeling, the romantic error of amiable minds. Thoſe, who really poſſeſs ſenſibility, ought early to be taught, that it is a dangerous quality, which is continually extracting the exceſs of miſery, or delight, from every ſurrounding circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. And, ſince, in our paſſage through this world, painful circumſtances occur more frequently than pleaſing ones, and ſince our ſenſe of evil is, I fear, more accute than our ſenſe of good, we become the victims of our feelings, unleſs we can in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree command them. I know you will ſay, (for you are young, my Emily) I know you will ſay, that you are contented ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to ſuffer, rather than to give up your refined ſenſe of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, at others; but, when your mind has been long haraſſed by viciſſitude, you will be content to reſt, and you will then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover from your deluſion. You will perceive, that the phantom of happineſs is exchanged for the ſubſtance; for happineſs ariſes in a ſtate of peace, not of tumult. It is of a temperate and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form nature, and can no more exiſt in a heart, that is continually alive to minute circumſtances, than in one that is dead to feeling. You ſee, my dear, that, though I would guard you againſt the dangers of ſenſibility, I am not an advocate for apathy. At your age I ſhould have ſaid <hi>that</hi> is a vice more hateful than all the errors of ſenſibility, and I ſay ſo ſtill. I call it a <hi>vice,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it leads to poſitive evil; in this, however, it does no more than an ill governed ſenſibility, which, by ſuch a rule might alſo be called a vice; but the evil of the former is of more general conſequence.

                     <p>Emily aſſured him, that his advice was moſt precious to her, and that ſhe would never forget it, or ceaſe from endeavouring to profit by it. St. Aubert ſmiled affectionately and ſorrowfully upon her. "I repeat it," ſaid he, "I would not teach you to

                     <p>St. Aubert, ſometime after, ſpoke of Madam Cheron, his ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. "Let me inform you of a circumſtance, that nearly affects your welfare," he added, "We have, you know, had little intercourſe for ſome years; but, as ſhe is now your only female relation, I have thought it proper to conſign you to her care, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

I need not recommend it to your prudence, my love, to endeavour to conciliate her kindneſs; you will do this for his ſake, who has often wiſhed to do ſo for yours."</p>
                     <p>Emily aſſured him, that, whatever he requeſted ſhe would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly perform to the utmoſt of her ability. "Alas!" added ſhe, in a voice interrupted by ſighs, "that will ſoon be all which remains for me; it will be almoſt my only conſolation to fulfil your wiſhes."</p>
                     <p>St. Aubert looked up ſilently in her face, as if he would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> and dull. She felt that look at her heart. "My dear father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe exclaimed; and then, checking herſelf, preſſed his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

cloſer, and hid her face with her handkerchief. Her tears were concealed, but St. Aubert heard her convulſive ſobs. His ſpirits returned. "O my child!" ſaid he, faintly, "let my conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be yours. I die in peace; for I know, that I am about to return to the boſom of my Father, who will ſtill be your Father, when I am gone. Always truſt in him, my love, and he will ſupport you in theſe moments, as he ſupports me."</p>
                     <p>Emily could only liſten, and weep; but the extreme compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his manner, and the faith and hope he expreſſed, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſoothed her anguiſh. Yet, whenever ſhe looked upon his emaciated countenance, and ſaw the lines of death beginning to prevail over it—ſaw his ſunk eyes ſtill bent on her, and their heavy lids preſſing to a cloſe, there was a pang in her heart, ſuch as defied expreſſion, though it required filial virtue, like hers, to forbear the attempt.</p>
                     <p>He deſired once more to bleſs her; "Where are you my dear?" ſaid he, as he ſtretched forth his hands. Emily had turned to the window, that he might not perceive her anguiſh; ſhe now underſtood, that his ſight had failed him. When he had given her his bleſſing, and it ſeemed to be the laſt effort of of expiring life, he ſunk back on his pillow. She kiſſed his forehead; the damps of death had ſettled there, and, forgetting her fortitude, for a moment, her tears mingled with them. St. Aubert lifted up his eyes; the ſpirit of a father returned to them, but it quickly vaniſhed, and he ſpoke no more.</p>
                     <p>St. Aubert lingered till about three o'clock in the afternoon, and, thus gradually ſinking into death, he expired without a ſtruggle, or a ſigh.</p>
                     <p>Emily was led from the chamber by La Voiſin and his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; who did what they could to comfort her. The old man ſat and wept with her. Agnes was more erroneouſly officious.</p>

The features, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid and ſerene, told the nature of the laſt ſenſations that had lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered in the now deſerted frame. For a moment ſhe turned away, in horror of the ſtillneſs in which death had fixed the countenance, never till now ſeen otherwiſe than animated; th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

She continued to gaze wildly; took up the cold hand; ſpoke; ſtill gazed, and then burſt into a tranſport of grief. La Voiſin, hearing her ſobs, came into the room to lead her away, but ſhe heard nothing, and only begged that he would leave her.</p>
                     <p>Again alone, ſhe indulged her tears, and, when the gloom of evening obſcured the chamber, and almoſt veiled from her eyes the object of her diſtreſs, ſhe ſtill hung over the body; till her ſpirits, at length were exhauſted, and ſhe became tranquil. La Voiſin again knocked at the door, and entreated that ſhe would come to the common apartment. Before ſhe went, ſhe kiſſed the lips of St. Aubert, as ſhe was wont to do when ſhe bade him good night. Again ſhe kiſſed them; her heart felt as if it would break, a few tears of agony ſtarted to her eyes, ſhe looked up to heaven, then at St. Aubert, and left the room.</p>
                     <p>Retired to her lonely cabin, her melancholy thoughts ſtill hovered round the body of her deceaſed parent; and, when ſhe ſunk into a kind of ſlumber, the images of her waking mind ſtill haunted her fancy. She thought ſhe ſaw her father ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching her with a benign countenance; then, ſmiling mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

and pointing upwards, his lips moved, but inſtead of words, ſhe heard ſweet muſic borne on the diſtant air, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſaw his features glow with the mild rapture of a ſuperior being. The ſtrain ſeemed to ſwell louder, and ſhe awoke. The viſion was gone, but muſic yet come to her ear in ſtrains ſuch as angels might breathe. She doubted, liſtened, raiſed herſelf in the bed, and again liſtened. It was muſic, and not an illuſion of her imagination. After a ſolemn ſteady harmony, it pauſed; then roſe again, in mournful ſweetneſs, and then died, in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that ſeemed to bear away the liſtening ſoul to heaven. She inſtantly remembered the muſic of the preceding night, with the ſtrange circumſtances, related by La Voiſin, and the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting converſation it had led to, concerning the ſtate of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted ſpirits. All that St. Aubert had ſaid, on that ſubject, now preſſed upon her heart, and overwhelmed it. What a change in a few hours! He, who then could only conjecture, was now made acquainted with truth; was himſelf become one of the departed! As ſhe liſtened, ſhe was chilled with ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious awe, her tears ſtopped; and ſhe roſe, and went to the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. All without was obſcured in ſhade; but Emily, turning her eyes from the maſſy darkneſs of the woods, whoſe waving outline appeared on the horizon, ſaw, on the le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t, that effulgent planet, which the old man had pointed out, ſetting over the woods. She remembered what he had ſaid concerning it, and the muſic now coming at intervals on the air, ſhe uncloſed the caſement to liſten to the ſtrains, that ſoon gradually ſunk to a greater diſtance, and tried to diſcover whence they came.—The obſcurity prevented her from diſtinguiſhing any object on the green platform below; and the ſounds became fainter and fainter, till they ſoftened into ſilence. She liſtened, but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned no more. Soon after, ſhe obſerved the planet trembling between the fringed tops of the woods, and, in the next moment, ſink behind them. Chilled with a melancholy awe, ſhe retired once more to her bed, and, at length, forgot for a while her ſorrows in ſleep.</p>
                     <p>On the following morning, ſhe was viſited by a ſiſter of the convent, who came, with kind offices and a ſecond invitation from the lady abbeſs; and Emily, though ſhe could not forſake the cottage, while the remains of her father were in it, conſented, however painful ſuch a viſit muſt be, in the preſent ſtate of her ſpirits, to pay her reſpects to the abbeſs, in the evening.</p>
                     <p>About an hour before ſunſet, La Voiſin ſhewed her the way through the woods to the convent, which ſtood in a ſmall bay

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by ſorrow; Emily ſtruggled againſt the ſickening faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that came over her, and was led into the preſence of the abbeſs, who received her with an air of maternal tenderneſs; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> with an inſtantaneous gratitude; her eyes were filled with tears, and the words ſhe would have ſpoken faltered on her lips. The abbeſs led her to a ſeat, and ſat down beſide her, ſtill holding her hand and regarding her in ſilence, as Emily dried her tears and attempted to ſpeak. "Be compoſed, my daughter," ſaid the abbeſs in a ſoothing voice, "do not ſpeak yet; I know all you would ſay. Your ſpirits muſt be ſoothed. We are going to prayers;—will you attend our evening ſervice? It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, my child, to look up in our afflictions to a Father, who ſees and pities us, and who chaſtens in his mercy."</p>
                     <p>Emily's tears flowed again, but a thouſand ſweet emotion mingled with them. The abbeſs ſuffered her to weep without interruption, and watched over her with a look of benignity, that might have characterized the countenance of a guardian an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel. Emily, when ſhe became tranquil, was encouraged to ſpeak without reſerve, and to mention the motive, that made her unwilling to quit the cottage, which the abbeſs did not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe even by a hint; but praiſed the filial piety of her conduct, and added a hope, that ſhe would paſs a few days at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, before ſhe returned to La Vallee. "you muſt allow yourſelf a little time to recover from your firſt ſhock, my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, before you encounter a ſecond; I will not affect to conceal from you how much I know your heart muſt ſuffer, on returning to the ſcene of your former happineſs. Here, you will have all, that quiet and ſympathy and religion can give, to reſtore your ſpirits. But come," added ſhe, obſerving the tears ſwell in Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily's eyes, "we will go to the chapel."</p>
                     <p>Emily followed to the parlour, where the nuns were aſſembled, to whom the abbeſs committed her, ſaying, "This is a daughter, for whom I have much eſteem; be ſiſters to her."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="89" facs="unknown:029378_0045_0FE07E8443261760"/>
They paſſed on in a train to the chapel, where the ſolemn de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, with which the ſervice was performed, elevated her mind, and brought to it the comforts of faith and reſignation.</p>
                     <p>Twilight came on, before the abbeſs's kindneſs would ſuffer Emily to depart, when ſhe left the convent, with a heart much lighter than ſhe had entered it, and was reconducted by La Voiſin through the woods, the penſive gloom of which was in uniſon with the temper of her mind; and ſhe purſued the little wild path, in muſing ſilence, till her guide ſuddenly ſtopped, looked round, and then ſtruck out of the path into the high graſs, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſaying he had miſtaken the road. He now walked on quickly, and Emily, proceeding with difficulty over the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured and uneven ground, was left at ſome diſtance, till her voice arreſted him, who ſeemed unwilling to ſtop, and ſtill hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on. "If you are in doubt about the way," ſaid Emily, "had we not better inquire it at the chateau yonder, between the trees?"</p>
                     <p>"No," replied La Voiſin, "there is no occaſion. When we reach that brook, ma'amſelle, (you ſee the light upon the water there, beyond the woods) when we reach that brook, we ſhall be at home preſently. I don't know how I happened to miſtake the path; I ſeldom come this way after ſunſet."</p>
                     <p>"It is ſolitary enough," ſaid Emily, "but you have no ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditti here." "No, ma'amſelle—no banditti."</p>
                     <p>"What are you afraid of then, my good friend? you are not ſuperſtitious?" "No, not ſuperſtitious; but, to tell you the truth, lady, nobody likes to go near that chateau, after duſk." "By whom is it inhabited," ſaid Emily, "that it is ſo formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable?" "Why, ma'amſelle, it is ſcarcely inhabited, for our lord the Marquis, and the lord of all theſe fine woods, too, is dead. He had not once been in it, for theſe many years, and his people, who have the care of it, live in a cottage cloſe by." Emily now underſtood this to be the chateau, which La Voiſin had formerly pointed out, as having belonged to the Marquis Villeroi, on the mention of which her father had appeared ſo much affected.</p>
                     <p>"Ah! it is a deſolate place now," continued La Voiſin, "and ſuch a grand, fine place, as I remember it!" Emily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired what had occaſioned this lamentable change; but the old-man was ſilent, and Emily, whoſe intereſt was awakened by the fear he had expreſſed, and above all by a recollection of her father's agitation, repeated the queſtion, and added, "If you are neither afraid of the inhabitants, my good friend, nor are ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious,
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:029378_0046_0FE07E8A34166190"/>
how happens it, that you dread to paſs near that chateau in the dark?"</p>
                     <p>"Perhaps, then, I am a little ſuperſtitious, ma'amſelle; and, if you knew what I do, you might be ſo too. Strange things have happened there. Monſieur, your good father, appeared to have known the late Marchioneſs." "Pray inform me what did happen?" ſaid Emily, with much emotion.</p>
                     <p>"Alas! ma'amſelle," anſwered La Voiſin, "inquire no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: it is not for me to lay open the domeſtic ſecrets of my lord." Emily, ſurpriſed by the old man's words, and his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of delivering them, forbore to repeat her queſtion; a nearer intereſt, the remembrance of St. Aubert, occupied her thoughts, and ſhe was led to recollect the muſic ſhe heard on the preceding night, which ſhe mentioned to La Voiſin. "You was not alone, ma'amſelle, in this," he replied, "I heard it too; but I have ſo often heard it, at the ſame hour, that I was ſcarcely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed."</p>
                     <p>"You doubtleſs believe this muſic to have ſome connection with the chateau," ſaid Emily ſuddenly, "and are, therefore, ſuperſtitious." "It may be ſo, ma'amſelle, but there are other circumſtances, belonging to that chateau, which I remember, and ſadly too." A heavy ſigh followed: but Emily's delicacy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained the curioſity theſe words revived, and ſhe inquired no further.</p>
                     <p>On reaching the cottage, all the violence of her grief return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; it ſeemed as if ſhe had eſcaped its heavy preſſure only while ſhe was removed from the object of it. She paſſed immediately to the chamber, where the remains of her father were laid, and yielded to all the anguiſh of hopeleſs grief. La Voiſin at length, perſuaded her to leave the room, and ſhe returned to her own, where, exhauſted, by the ſufferings of the day, ſhe ſoon fell into deep ſleep<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and awoke conſiderably refreſhed.</p>
                     <p>When the dreadful hour arrived, in which the remains of St. Aubert were to be taken from her for ever, ſhe went alone to the chamber to look upon his countenance yet once again, and La Voiſin, who had waited patiently below ſtairs, till her deſpair ſhould ſubſide, with the reſpect due to grief, forbore to interrupt the indulgence of it, till ſurpriſe, at the length of her ſtay, and then apprehenſion overcame his delicacy, and he went to lead her from the chamber. Having tapped gently at the door, without receiving an anſwer, he liſtened attentively, but all was ſtill, no ſigh, no ſob of anguiſh was heard. Yet more alarmed by this ſilence, he opened the door, and found Emily lying ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:029378_0046_0FE07E8A34166190"/>
acroſs the foot of the bed, near which ſtood the coffin. His calls procured aſſiſtance, and ſhe was carried to her room, where proper applications, at length reſtored her.</p>
                     <p>During her ſtate of inſenſibility, La Voiſin had given direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the coffin to be cloſed, and he ſucceeded in perſuading Emily to forbear reviſiting the chamber. She, indeed, felt her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unequal to this, and alſo perceived the neceſſity of ſparing her ſpirits, and recollecting fortitude ſufficient to bear her through the approaching ſcene. St. Aubert had given a particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, that his remains ſhould be interred in the church of the convent of St. Clair, and, in mentioning the north chancel, near the ancient tomb of the Villerois, had pointed out the exact ſpot, where he wiſhed to be laid. The ſuperior had granted this place for the interment, and thither, therefore, the ſad proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion now moved, which was met, at the gates, by the venerable prieſt, followed by a train of friars. Every perſon who heard the ſolemn chant of the anthem, and the peal of the organ, that ſtruck up, when the body entered the church, and ſaw alſo the feeble ſteps, and the aſſumed tranquillity of Emily, gave her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary tears. She ſhed none, but walked, her face partly ſhaded by a thin black veil, between two perſons, who ſupported her, prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the abbeſs, and followed by nuns, whoſe plaintive voices mellowed the ſwelling harmony of the dirge. When the proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion came to the grave the muſic ceaſed. Emily drew the veil entirely over her face, and, in a momentary pauſe, between the anthem and the reſt of the ſervice, her ſobs were diſtinctly audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The holy father began the ſervice, and Emily again com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded her feelings, till the coffin was let down, and ſhe heard the earth rattle on its lid. Then, as ſhe ſhuddered, a groan burſt from her heart, and ſhe leaned for ſupport on the perſon who ſtood next to her. In a few moments ſhe recovered; and, when ſhe heard thoſe affecting and ſublime words: "His body is buried in peace, and his ſoul returns to Him that gave it," her anguiſh ſoftened into tears.</p>
                     <p>The abbeſs led her from the church into her own parlour, and there adminiſtered all the conſolations, that religion and gentle ſympathy can give. Emily ſtruggled againſt the preſſure of grief; but the abbeſs, obſerving her attentively, ordered a bed to be prepared, and recommended her to retire to repoſe. She alſo kindly claimed her promiſe to remain a few days at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, and Emily, who had no wiſh to return to the cottage, the ſcene of all her ſufferings, had leiſure, now that no immediate care preſſed upon her attention, to feel the indiſpoſition, which diſabled her from immediately travelling.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="92" facs="unknown:029378_0047_0FE07E97AB232AC8"/>
Meanwhile, the maternal kindneſs of the abbeſs, and the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle attentions of the nuns did all, that was poſſible, towards ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſpirits and reſtoring her health. But the latter was too deeply wounded, through the medium of her mind, to be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revived. She lingered for ſome weeks at the convent, under the influence of a ſlow fever, wiſhing to return home, yet una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to go thither; often even reluctant to leave the ſpot where her father's relics were depoſited, and ſometimes ſoothing herſelf with the conſideration, that, if ſhe died here, her remains would repoſe beſide thoſe of St. Aubert. In the meanwhile, ſhe ſent letters to Madame Cheron and to the old houſekeeper, inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them of the ſad event that had taken place, and of her own ſituation. From her aunt ſhe received an anſwer, abounding more in common-place condolement, than in traits of real ſorrow which aſſured her, that a ſervant ſhould be ſent to conduct her to La Vallee, for that her own time was ſo much occupied by company, that ſhe had no leiſure to undertake ſo long a journey. However Emily might prefer La Vallee, to Tholouſe, ſhe could not be inſenſible of the indecorous and unkind conduct of her aunt, in ſuffering her to return thither, where ſhe had no longer a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to conſole and protect her; a conduct, which was the mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> culpable, ſince St. Aubert had appointed Madame Cheron the guardian of his orphan daughter.</p>
                     <p>Madame Cheron's ſervant made the attendance of the good La Voiſin unneceſſary; and Emily, who felt ſenſibly her obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to him, for all his kind attention to her late father, as well as to herſelf, was glad to ſpare him a long, and what, at his time of life, muſt have been a troubleſome journey.</p>
                     <p>During her ſtay at the convent, the peace and ſanctity that reigned within, the tranquil beauty of the ſcenery without, and the delicate attentions of the abbeſs and the nuns, were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſo ſoothing, to her mind, that they almoſt tempted her to leave a world, where ſhe had loſt her deareſt friends, and devote herſelf to the cloiſter, in a ſpot, rendered ſacred to her by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the tomb of St. Aubert. The penſive enthuſiaſm, too, ſo natural to her temper, had ſpread a beautiful illuſion over the ſanctified retirement of a nun, that almoſt hid from her view the ſelfiſhneſs of its ſecurity. But the touches, which a melancholy fancy, ſlightly tinctured with ſuperſtition, gave to the monaſtic ſcene, began to fade, as her ſpirits revived, and brought once more to her heart an image, which had only tranſiently been baniſhed thence. By this ſhe was ſilently awakened to hope and comfort and ſweet affections; viſions of happineſs gleamed
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:029378_0047_0FE07E97AB232AC8"/>
faintly at a diſtance, and, though ſhe knew them to be illuſions, ſhe could not reſolve to ſhut them out for ever. It was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Valancourt, of his taſte, his genius, and of the countenance which glowed with both, that, perhaps, alone de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined her to return to the world. The grandeur and ſublim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of the ſcenes, amidſt which they had firſt met, had faſcinated her fancy, and had imperceptibly contributed to render Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court more intereſting, by ſeeming to communicate to him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of their own character. The eſteem, too, which St. Aubert had repeatedly expreſſed for him, ſanctioned this kindneſs; but, though his countenance and manner had continually expreſſed his admiration of her, he had no otherwiſe declared it; and even the hope of ſeeing him again was ſo diſtant, that ſhe was ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſcious of it, ſtill leſs that it influenced her conduct on this occaſion.</p>
                     <p>It was ſeveral days after the arrival of Madame Cheron's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant before Emily was ſufficiently recovered to undertake the journey to La Vallee. On the evening preceding her departure, ſhe went to the cottage to take leave of La Voiſin and his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to make them a return for their kindneſs. The old man ſhe found ſitting on a bench at his door, between his daughter, and his ſon in-law, who was juſt returned from his daily labour, and who was playing upon a pipe, that, in tone, reſembled an oboe. A flaſk of wine ſtood beſide the old man, and, before him, a ſmall table with fruit and bread, round which ſtood ſeveral of his grandſons, fine roſy children, who were taking their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as their mother diſtributed it. On the edge of the little green, that ſpread before the cottage, were cattle and a few ſheep repoſing under the trees. The landſcape was touched with the mellow light of the evening ſun, whoſe long ſlanting beams played through a viſta of the woods, and lighted up the diſtant turrets of the chateau. She pauſed a moment, before ſhe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erged from the ſhade, to gaze upon the happy group before her, on the complacency and eaſe of healthy age, depictured on the countenance of La Voiſin; the maternal tenderneſs of Agnes, as ſhe looked upon her children, and the innocency of infantine pleaſures reflected in their ſmiles. Emily looked again at the venerable old man, and at the cottage; the memory of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther roſe with full force upon her mind, and ſhe haſtily ſtepped forward, afraid to truſt herſelf with a longer pauſe. She took an affectionate and affecting leave of La Voiſin and his family; he ſeemed to love her as his daughter, and ſhed tears; Emily ſhed many. She avoided going into the cottage, ſince ſhe

                        </gap> of the open grave, till ſhe found herſelf almoſt on its brink. A friar of the convent had been burried there on the preceding evening, and, as ſhe had ſat alone in her chamber at twilight, ſhe heard, at diſtance, the monks chanting the requiem for his ſoul. This brought freſhly to her memory the circumſtances of her father's death; and, as the voices, mingling with a low quer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulous peal of the organ, ſwelled faintly, gloomy and affecting vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions had ariſen upon her mind. Now ſhe remembered them and, turning aſide to avoid the broken ground, theſe recollections made her paſs on with quicker ſteps to the grave of St. Aubert when in the moonlight, that fell athwart a remote part of the

                        </gap>, ſhe thought ſhe ſaw a ſhadow gliding between the pillars. She ſtopped to liſten, and, not hearing any footſtep, believed that her fancy had deceived her, and, no longer apprehenſive of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obſerved, proceeded. St. Aubert was buried beneath a plain marble, bearing little more than his name and the date of his birth and death, near the foot of the ſtately monument of the Villerois. Emily remained at his grave, till a chime, that called the monks to early prayers, warned her to retire; then, ſhe wept over it a laſt farewel, and forced herſelf from the ſpot. After this hour of melancholy indulgence, ſhe was refreſhed by a deeper ſleep than ſhe had experienced for a long time, and, on awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, her mind was more tranquil and reſigned than it had been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>But, when the moment of her departure from the convent ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, all her grief returned; the memory of the dead, and the kindneſs of the living attached her to the place; and for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>She had travelled ſeveral leagues, before the ſcenes of the country, through which ſhe paſſed, had power to rouſe her for a moment from the deep melancholy, into which ſhe was ſunk, and, when they did, it was only to remind her, that, on her laſt view of them, St. Aubert was at her ſide, and to call up to her remembrance the remarks he had delivered on ſimilar ſcenery. Thus, without any particular occurrence, paſſed the day in lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guor and dejection. She ſlept that night at a town on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Towards the cloſe of this day, Emily came within view of the plains in the neighbourhood of La Vallee, and the well known ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of former times began to preſs upon her notice, and with them recollections that awakened all her tenderneſs and grief. Often, while ſhe looked through her tears upon the wild gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of the Pyrenees, now varied with the rich lights and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of evening, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> remembered, that, when laſt ſhe ſaw them, her father partook with her of the pleaſure they inſpired. Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſome ſcene, which he had particularly pointed out to her,

                     <p>As ſhe drew near the chateau, theſe melancholy memorials of paſt times multiplied. At length, the chateau itſelf appeared amid the glowing beauty of St. Aubert's favourite landſcape. This was an object, which called for fortitude, not for tears; Emily dried hers, and prepared to meet with calmneſs the trying moment of her return to that home, where there was no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>A turn on the road now allowed a nearer view of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Again ſhe reſiſted the preſſure of ſorrow, till her ear caught the gay melody of the dance, which ſhe had ſo often liſtened <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

bark. "Ah, ma'amſelle!—my poor maſter!" ſaid Thereſa, whoſe feelings were more awakened than her delicacy, "Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chon's gone to look for him." Emily ſobbed aloud; and on looking towards the carriage, which ſtill ſtood with the door open, ſaw the animal ſpring into it, and inſtantly leap out, and then with his noſe on the ground run round the horſes.</p>
                     <p>"Don't cry ſo, ma'amſelle," ſaid Thereſa, "it breaks my heart to ſee you." The dog now came running to Emily, then returned to the carriage, and then back again to her, whining and diſcontented. "Poor rogue!" ſaid Thereſa, "thou haſt loſt thy maſter, thou may'ſt well cry! But come, my dear young lady, be comforted. What ſhall I get to refreſh you?" Emily gave her hand to the old ſervant, and tried to reſtrain her grief, while ſhe made ſome kind inquiries concerning her health. But ſhe ſtill lingered in the walk which led to the chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eau, for within was no perſon to meet her with the kiſs of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; her own heart no longer palpitated with impatient joy to meet again the well known ſmile, and ſhe dreaded to ſee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, which would recall the full remembrance of her former hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. She moved ſlowly towards the door, pauſed, went on, and pauſed again. How ſilent, how forſaken, how forlorn did the chateau appear! Trembling to enter it, yet blaming herſelf for delaying what ſhe could not avoid, ſhe, at length, paſſed into the hall; croſſed it with a hurried ſtep, as if afraid to look round, and opened the door of that room, which ſhe was wont to call her own. The gloom of evening gave ſolemnity to its ſilent and deſerted air.</p>
                     <p>The chairs, the tables, every article of furniture, ſo familiar to her in happier times, ſpoke eloquently to her heart. She ſeated herſelf, without immediately obſerving it, in a window, which opened upon the garden, and where St. Aubert had often ſat with her, watching the ſun retire from the rich and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive proſpect, that appeared beyond the groves.</p>
                     <p>Having indulged her tears for ſometime, ſhe became more compoſed; and, when Thereſa, after ſeeing the baggage depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited in her lady's room, again appeared, ſhe had ſo far recovered her ſpirits, as to be able to converſe with her.</p>
                     <p>"I have made up the green bed for you, ma'amſelle" ſaid Thereſa, as ſhe ſet the coffee upon the table. "I thought you would like it better than your own now; but I little thought this day month, that you would come back alone. A-well-a-day! the news almoſt broke my heart, when it did come. Who would have believed, that my poor maſter when he went from
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:029378_0050_0FE07EAF4D1FAA38"/>
home, would never return again!" Emily hid her face with her handkerchief, and waved her hand.</p>
                     <p>"Do taſte the coffee," ſaid Thereſa. "My dear young la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, be comforted—we muſt all die. My dear maſter is a ſaint above." Emily took the handkerchief from her face, and raiſed her eyes full of tears towards heaven; ſoon after ſhe dried them, and, in a calm, but tremulous voice, began to inquire concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome of her late father's penſioners.</p>
                     <p>"Alas-a-day!" ſaid Thereſa, as ſhe poured out the coffee, and handed it to her miſtreſs, "all that could come, have been here every day to inquire after you and my maſter." She then proceeded to tell, that ſome were dead whom they had left well; and others, who were ill, had recovered. "And ſee, ma'am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle," added Thereſa, "there is old Mary coming up the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den now; ſhe has looked every day theſe three years as if ſhe would die, yet ſhe is alive ſtill. She has ſeen the chaiſe at the door, and knows you are come home."</p>
                     <p>The ſight of this poor old woman would have been too much for Emily, and ſhe begged Thereſa would go and tell her, that ſhe was too ill to ſee any perſon that night. "To-morrow I ſhall be better, perhaps; but give her this token of my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance."</p>
                     <p>Emily ſat for ſometime, given up to ſorrow. Not an object, on which her eye glanced, but awakened ſome remembrance, that led immediately to the ſubject of her grief. Her favourite plants, which St. Aubert had taught her to nurſe; the little draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that adorned the room, which his taſte had inſtructed her to execute; the books that he had ſelected for her uſe, and which they had read together; her muſical inſtruments, whoſe ſounds he loved ſo well, and which he ſometimes awakened himſelf—every object gave new force to ſorrow. At length, ſhe rouſed herſelf from this melancholy indulgence, and, ſummoning all her reſolution, ſtepped forward to go into thoſe forlorn rooms, which, though ſhe dreaded to enter, ſhe knew would yet more powerfully affect her, if ſhe delayed to viſit them.</p>
                     <p>Having paſſed through the green-houſe, her courage for a moment forſook her, when ſhe opened the door of the library; and, perhaps, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he ſhade, which evening and the foliage of the, rees near the windows threw acroſs the room, heightened the ſolemnity of her feelings on entering that apartment, where every thing ſpoke of her father. There was an armchair, in which he uſed to ſit; ſhe ſhrunk when ſhe obſerved it, for ſhe had ſo often ſeen him ſeated there, and the idea of him roſe ſo diſtinctly
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:029378_0050_0FE07EAF4D1FAA38"/>
to her mind, that ſhe almoſt fancied ſhe ſaw him before her.—But ſhe checked the illuſions of a diſtempered imagination, though ſhe could not ſubdue a certain degree of awe, which now mingled with her emotions. She walked ſlowly to the chair, and ſeated herſelf in it; there was a reading deſk before it, on which lay a book open, as it had been left by her father. It was ſome moments before ſhe recovered courage enough to examine it; and, when ſhe looked at the open page, ſhe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately recollected, that St. Aubert, on the evening before his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from the chateau, had read to her ſome paſſages from this his favourite author. The circumſtance now affected her extremely; ſhe looked at the page, wept, and looked again.—To her the book appeared ſacred and invaluable, and ſhe would not have moved it, or cloſed the page, which he had left open, for the treaſures of the Indies. Still ſhe ſat before the deſk, and could not reſolve to quit it, though the increaſing gloom, and the profound ſilence of the apartment, revived a degree of pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful awe. Her thoughts dwelt on the probable ſtate of departed ſpirits, and ſhe remembered the affecting converſation, which had paſſed between St. Aubert and La Voiſin, on the night pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding his death. As ſhe muſed ſhe ſaw the door ſlowly open, and a ruſtling ſound in a remote part of the room ſtartled her. Through the duſk ſhe thought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> perceived ſomething move.—The ſubject ſhe had been conſidering, and the preſent tone of her ſpirits, which made her imagination reſpond to every im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of her ſenſes, gave her a ſudden terror of ſomething ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural. She ſat for a moment motionleſs, and then, her diſſipated reaſon returning. "What ſhould I fear?" ſaid ſhe.—"If the ſpirits of thoſe we love ever return to us, it is in kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs."</p>
                     <p>The ſilence, which again reigned, made her aſhamed of her late fears, and ſhe believed, that her imagination had deluded her, or that ſhe had heard one of thoſe unaccountable noiſes, which ſometimes occur in old houſes. The ſame ſound, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, returned; and, diſtinguiſhing ſomething moving towards her, and in the next inſtant preſs beſide her into the chair, ſhe ſhrieked; but her fleeting ſenſes were inſtantly recalled, on per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that it was Manchon who ſat by her, and who now lick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her hands affectionately.</p>
                     <p>Perceiving her ſpirits unequal to the taſk ſhe had aſſigned her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of viſiting the deſerted rooms of the chateau this night, when ſhe left the library, ſhe walked in the garden, and down to the terrace, that overhung the river. The ſun was now ſet;

but, under the dark branches of the almond trees, was ſeen the ſaffron glow of the weſt, ſpreading beyond the twilight of mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle air. The bat flitted ſilently by; and, now and then, the mourning note of the nightingale was heard. The circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the hour brought to her recollection ſome lines, which ſhe had once heard St. Aubert recite on this very ſpot, and ſhe had now a melancholy pleaſure in repeating them.</p>

                     <p>Emily, wandering on, came to St. Aubert's favourite plane-tree, where ſo often, at this hour, they had ſat beneath the ſhade together, and with her dear mother ſo often had converſed on the ſubject of a future ſtate. How often, too, had her father expreſſed the comfort he derived from believing, that they ſhould meet in another world I Emily, overcome by theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collections, left the plane-tree, and, as ſhe leaned penſively o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> the wall of the terrace, ſhe obſerved a group of peaſants dancing gaily on the banks of the Garonne, which ſpread in broad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſe below, and reflected the evening light. What a contraſt they formed to the deſolate, unhappy Emily! They were gay and <hi>debonnaire,</hi> as they were wont to be when ſhe, too, was gay, when St. Aubert uſed to liſten to their merry muſic, with a countenance beaming pleaſure and benevolence. Emily, having looked for a moment on this ſprightly band, turned away, una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to bear the remembrances it excited; but where, alas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> could ſhe turn, and not meet new objects to give acuteneſs to grief?</p>
                     <p>As ſhe walked ſlowly towards the houſe, ſhe was met by Thereſa. "Dear ma'amſelle," ſaid ſhe, "I have been ſeeking
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:029378_0051_0FE0802AEFAA2DD0"/>
you up and down this half hour, and was afraid ſome accident had happened to you. How can you like to wander about ſo in this night air! Do come into the houſe. Think what my poor maſter would have ſaid, if he could ſee you. I am ſure, when my dear lady died, no gentleman could take it more to heart than he did, yet you know he ſeldom ſhed a tear."</p>
                     <p>"Pray, Thereſa, ceaſe," ſaid Emily, wiſhing to interrupt this ill-judged, but well meaning harrangue; Thereſa's loquacity, however, was not to be ſilenced ſo eaſily. "And when you uſed to grieve ſo," ſhe added, "he often told you how wrong it was—for that my miſtreſs was happy. And, if ſhe was hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, I am ſure he is ſo too; for the prayers of the poor, they ſay, reach heaven." During this ſpeech, Emily had walked ſilently into the chateau, and Thereſa lighted her acroſs the hall into the common ſitting parlour, where ſhe had laid the cloth, with one ſolitary knife and fork, for ſupper. Emily was in the room before ſhe perceived that it was not her own apartment, but ſhe checked the emotion which inclined her to leave it, and ſeated herſelf quietly by the little ſupper table. Her father's hat hung upon the, oppoſite wall; while ſhe gazed at it, a faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs came over her. Thereſa looked at her, and then at the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, on which her eyes were ſettled, and went to remove it; but Emily waved her hand—"No," ſaid ſhe, "let it remain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am going to my chamber." "Nay ma'amſelle, ſupper is ready." "I cannot take it." replied Emily, "I will go to my room, and try to ſleep. To-morrow I ſhall be better."</p>
                     <p>"This is poor doings!" ſaid Thereſa. "Dear lady! do take ſome food! I have dreſſed a pheaſant, and a fine one it is. Old <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"Did he?" ſaid Emily, in a tender voice, while ſhe felt her poor heart warmed for a moment by a ray of ſympathy.</p>
                     <p>At length, her ſpirits were entirely overcome, and ſhe retired to her room.</p>

                        </gap>a Vallee, mentioning the extreme dejection of her ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and the neceſſity ſhe felt for quiet and retirement to reſtore them. Theſe ſhe knew were not to be found at Madame Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron's, whoſe inclinations led her into a life of diſſipation, which her ample fortune encouraged; and, having given her anſwer, ſhe felt ſomewhat more at eaſe.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt days of her affliction, ſhe was viſited by Monſieur Barreaux, a ſincere mourner for St. Aubert. "I may well la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment my friend," ſaid he, "for I ſhall never meet with his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance. If I could have found ſuch a man in what is called ſociety, I ſhould not have left it."</p>
                     <p>M. Barreaux's admiration of her father endeared him extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Emily, whoſe heart found almoſt its firſt relief in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of her parent's, with a man, whom ſhe ſo much revered, and who, though with ſuch an ungracious appearance, poſſeſſed ſo much goodneſs of heart, and delicacy of mind.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="103" facs="unknown:029378_0052_0FE07EBE7AAC66A8"/>
Several weeks paſſed away in quiet retirement, and Emily's affliction began to ſoften into melancholy. She could bear to read the books ſhe had before read with her father; to ſit in his chair in the library—to watch the flowers his hand had planted—to awaken the tones of that inſtrument his fingers had preſſed, and ſometimes even to play his favourite air.</p>
                     <p>When her mind had recovered from the firſt ſhock of afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, perceiving the danger of yielding to indolence, and that activity alone could reſtore its tone, ſhe ſcrupulouſly endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to paſs all her hours in employment. And it was now that ſhe underſtood the full value of the education ſhe had received from St. Aubert, for in cultivating her underſtanding he had ſecured her an aſylum from indolence, without recourſe to diſſipation, and rich and varied amuſement and information, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of the ſociety, from which her ſituation ſecluded her. Nor were the good effects of this education confined to ſelfiſh ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, ſince, St. Aubert having nouriſhed every amiable qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of her heart, it now expanded in benevolence to all around her, and taught her; when ſhe could not remove the misfortunes of others, at leaſt to ſoften them by ſympathy and tenderneſs;—a benevolence that taught her to feel for all, that could ſuffer.</p>
                     <p>Madame Cheron returned no anſwer to Emily's letter, who began to hope, that ſhe ſhould be permitted to remain ſometime longer in her retirement, and her mind had now ſo far recovered its ſtrength, that ſhe ventured to view the ſcenes, which moſt powerfully recalled the images of paſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>. Among theſe was the fiſhing-houſe; and, to indulge ſtill more the affectionate melancholy of the viſit, ſhe took thither her lute, that ſhe might again hear there the tones, to which St. Aubert and her mother had ſo often delighted to liſten. She went alone, and at that ſtill hour of the evening, which is ſo ſoothing to fancy and to grief. The laſt time ſhe had been here ſhe was in company with Monſieur and Madame St. Aubert, a few days preceding that, on which the latter was ſeized with a fatal illneſs Now, when Emily again entered the woods, that ſurrounded the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they awakened ſo forcibly the memory of former times, that her reſolution yielded for a moment to exceſs of grief.—She ſtopped, leaned for ſupport againſt a tree, and wept for ſome minutes, before ſhe had recovered herſelf ſufficiently to proceed. The little path, that led to the building, was overgrown with graſs, and the flowers which St. Aubert had ſcattered careleſsly along the border were almoſt choked with weeds—the tall thiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle—the fox-glove, and the nettle. She often pauſed to look on
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:029378_0053_0FE07EC3398710E8"/>
the deſolate ſpot, now ſo ſilent and forſaken, and when, with a trembling hand, ſhe opened the door of the fiſhing-houſe, "Ah!" ſaid ſhe, "every thing—every thing remains as when I left it laſt—left it with thoſe who never muſt return!" She went to a window, that overhung the rivulet, and leaning over it, with her eyes fixed on the current, was ſoon loſt in melancholy reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. The lute ſhe had brought lay forgotten beſide her; the mournful ſighing of the breeze, as it waved the high pines above, and its ſofter whiſpers among the oſiers, that bowed upon the banks below, was a kind of muſic more in uniſon with her feelings. It did not vibrate on the chords of unhappy memory, but was ſoothing to the heart as the voice of Pity. She contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to muſe, unconſcious of the gloom of evening, and that the ſun's laſt light trembled on the heights above, and would proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have remained ſo much longer, if a ſudden footſtep, without the building, had not alarmed her attention, and firſt made her recollect that ſhe was unprotected. In the next moment, a door opened, and a ſtranger appeared, who ſtopped on perceiving Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily, and then began to apologize for his intruſion. But Emily, at the ſound of his voice, loſt her fear in a ſtronger emotion; its tones were familiar to her ear, and, though ſhe could not readily diſtinguiſh through the duſk the features of the perſon who ſpoke, ſhe felt a remembrance too ſtrong to be diſtruſted.</p>
                     <p>He repeated his apology, and Emily then ſaid ſomething in reply, when the ſtranger, eagerly advancing, exclaimed, "Good God! can it be—ſurely I am not miſtaken—ma'amſelle St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert—is it not?"</p>
                     <p>"It is indeed," ſaid Emily, who was confirmed in her firſt conjecture, for ſhe now diſtinguiſhed the countenance of Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court, lighted up with ſtill more than its uſual animation. A thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand painful recollections crowded to her mind, and the effort, which ſhe made to ſupport herſelf, only ſerved to increaſe her agitation. Valancourt, meanwhile, having inquired anxiouſly after her health, and expreſſed his hopes, that M. St. Aubert had found benefit from travelling, learned from the flood of tears, which ſhe could no longer repreſs, the fatal truth. He led her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o a ſeat, and ſat down by her, while Emily continued to weep, and Valancourt to hold the hand, which ſhe was unconſcious he had taken, till it was wet with the tears, which grief for St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, and ſympathy for herſelf had called forth.</p>
                     <p>"I feel," ſaid he, at length, "I feel how inſufficient all at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt at conſolation muſt be on this ſubject. I can only mourn with you, for I cannot doubt the ſource of your tears. Would to God I were miſtaken!"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="105" facs="unknown:029378_0053_0FE07EC3398710E8"/>
Emily could ſtill anſwer only by tears, till ſhe roſe, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged they might leave the melancholy ſpot, when Valancourt, though he ſaw her feebleneſs, could not offer to detain her, but took her arm within his, and led her from the fiſhing houſe. They walked ſilently through the woods, Valancourt anxious to know, yet fearing to aſk any particulars concerning St. Aubert; and Emily too much diſtreſſed to converſe. After ſometime, however, ſhe acquired fortitude enough to ſpeak of her father, and to give a brief account of the manner of his death; during which recital, Valancourt's countenance betrayed ſtrong emotion, and, when he heard that St. Aubert had died on the road, and that Emily had been left among ſtrangers, he preſſed her hand between his, and involuntarily exclaimed, "Why was I not there!" but in the next moment recollected himſelf, for he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately returned to the mention of her father; till, perceiving that her ſpirits were exhauſted, he gradually changed the ſubject, and ſpoke of himſelf. Emily thus learned, that, after they had parted, he had wandered for ſometime, along the ſhores of the Mediterranean, and had then returned through Languedoc into Gaſcony, which was his native province, and where he uſually reſided.</p>
                     <p>When he had concluded his little narrative, he ſunk into a ſilence, which Emily was not diſpoſed to interrupt, and it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, till they reached the gate of the chateau, when he ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, as if he had known this to be the limit of his walk. Here, ſaying, that it was his intention to return to Eſtuviere on the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing day, he aſked her if ſhe would permit him to take leave of her in the morning; and Emily, perceiving that ſhe could not reject an ordinary civility, without expreſſing by her refuſal an expectation of ſomething more, was compelled to anſwer, that ſhe ſhould be at home.</p>
                     <p>She paſſed a melancholy evening, during which the retroſpect of all that had happened, ſince ſhe had ſeen Valancourt, would riſe to her imagination; and the ſcene of her father's death ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in tints as freſh, as if it had paſſed on the preceding day. She remembered particularly the earneſt and ſolemn manner, in which he had required her to deſtroy the manuſcript papers, and, awakening from the lethargy, in which ſorrow had held her, ſhe was ſhocked to think ſhe had not yet obeyed him, and determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that another day ſhould not reproach her with the neglect.</p>

                     <p>ON the next morning, Emily ordered a fire to be lighted in the ſtove of the chamber, where St. Aubert uſed to ſleep; and, as ſoon as ſhe had breakfaſted, went thither to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> the papers. Having faſtened the door to prevent interruption, ſhe opened the cloſet where they were concealed, as ſhe entered which, ſhe felt an emotion of unuſual awe, and ſtood for ſome moments ſurvey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, trembling, and almoſt afraid to remove the board. There was a great chair in one corner of the cloſet, and, oppoſite to it, ſtood the table, at which ſhe had ſeen her father ſit, on the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that preceded his departure, looking over, with ſo much emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what ſhe believed to be theſe very papers.</p>
                     <p>The ſolitary life, which Emily had led of late, and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy ſubjects, on which ſhe had ſuffered her thoughts to dwell, had rendered her at times ſenſible to the "thick-coming fancies" of a mind greatly enervated. It was lamentable, that her excellent underſtanding ſhould have yielded, even for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to the reveries of ſuperſtition, or rather to thoſe ſtarts of imagination, which deceive the ſenſes into what can be called nothing leſs than momentary madneſs. Inſtances of this tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary failure of mind had more than once occurred ſince her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home; particularly when, wandering through this lonely manſion in the evening twilight, ſhe had been alarmed by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, which would have been unſeen in her more cheerful days. To this infirm ſtate of her nerves may be attributed what ſhe imagined, when her eyes glancing a ſecond time on the arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chair, which ſtood in an obſcure part of the cloſet, the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of her dead father appeared there. Emily ſtood fixed for a moment to the floor, after which ſhe left the cloſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. Her ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, however, ſoon returned; ſhe reproached herſelf with the weakneſs of thus ſuffering interruption in an act of ſerious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and again opened the door. By the directions which St. Aubert had given her, ſhe readily found the beard he had deſcribed in an oppoſite corner of the cloſet, near the window; ſhe diſtinguiſhed alſo the line he had mentioned, and, preſſing it as he had bade her, it ſlid down, and diſcloſed the bundle of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, together with ſome ſcattered ones, and the purſe of louis.
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:029378_0054_0FE07ED0B3F2D7E8"/>
With a trembling hand ſhe removed them, replaced the board, pauſed a moment, and was riſing from the floor, when, on look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, there appeared to her alarmed fancy the ſame countenance in the chair. The illuſion, another inſtance of the unhappy ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect which ſolitude and grief had gradually produced upon her mind, ſubdued her ſpirits; ſhe ruſhed forward into the chamber, and ſunk almoſt ſenſeleſs into a chair. Returning reaſon ſoon overcame the dreadful, but pitiable, attack of imagination, and ſhe turned to the papers, though ſtill with ſo little recollection, that her eyes involuntarily ſettled on the writing of ſome looſe ſheets, which lay open; and ſhe was unconſcious, that ſhe was tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her father's ſtrict injunction, till a ſentence of dreadful import awakened her attention and her memory together. She haſtily put the papers from her; but the words, which had rouſed equally her curioſity and terror, ſhe could not diſmiſs from her thoughts. So powerfully had they affected her, that ſhe even could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to deſtroy the papers immediately; and the more ſhe dwelt on the circumſtance, the more it inflamed her imagination. Urged by the moſt forcible, and apparently the moſt neceſſary, curioſity to inquire farther, concerning the terrible and myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſubject, to which ſhe had ſeen an illuſion, ſhe began to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment her promiſe to deſtroy the papers. For a moment, ſhe even doubted, whether it could juſtly be obeyed, in contradiction to ſuch reaſons as there appeared to be for further information. But the deluſion was momentary.</p>
                     <p>"I have given a ſolemn promiſe," ſaid ſhe, "to obſerve a ſolemn injunction, and it is not my buſineſs to argue, but to obey. Let me haſten to remove the temptation, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Thus reanimated with a ſenſe of her duty, ſhe completed the triumph of integrity over temptation, more forcible than any ſhe had ever known, and conſigned the papers to the flames. Her eyes watched them as they ſlowly conſumed, ſhe ſhuddered at the recollection of the ſentence ſhe had juſt ſeen, and at the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, that the only opportunity of explaining it was then paſſing away for ever.</p>
                     <p>It was long after this, that ſhe recollected the purſe; and as ſhe was depoſiting it, unopened, in a cabinet, perceiving that it contained ſomething of a ſize larger than coin, ſhe examined it. "His hand depoſited them here," ſaid ſhe, as ſhe kiſſed ſome pieces of the coin, and wetted them with her tears, "his hand—which is now duſt!" At the bottom of the purſe was a ſmall

She ſtarted—"The ſame," ſaid ſhe, "my father wept over!" On examining the countenance ſhe could recollect no perſon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>St. Aubert had given no directions concerning this picture, nor had even named it; ſhe, therefore, thought herſelf juſtified in preſerving it. More than once remembering his manner, when he had ſpoken of the Marchioneſs of Villeroi, ſhe felt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to believe that this was her reſemblance; yet there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared no reaſon why he ſhould have preſerved a picture of that lady, or, having preſerved it, why he ſhould lament over it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> a manner ſo ſtriking and affecting as ſhe had witneſſed on the night preceding his departure.</p>
                     <p>Emily ſtill gazed on the countenance, examining its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, but ſhe knew not where to detect the charm that captivated <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Emily was rouſed from the muſing mood into which the picture had thrown her, by the cloſing of the garden gate; and, on turning her eyes to the window, ſhe ſaw Valancourt coming towards the chateau. Her ſpirits agitated by the ſubjects that had lately occupied her mind, ſhe felt unprepared to ſee him, and remained a few moments in the chamber to recover herſelf.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe met him in the parlour, ſhe was ſtruck with the change that appeared in his air and countenance ſince they had parted in Rouſillon, which twilight and the diſtreſs ſhe ſuffered on the preceding evening had prevented her from obſerving. But dejection and languor diſappeared, for a moment, in the ſmile that now enlightened his countenance, on perceiving her. "You ſee," ſaid he, "I have availed myſelf of the permiſſion with which you honoured me—of bidding <hi>you</hi> farewel, whom I had the happineſs of meeting only yeſterday."</p>
                     <p>Emily ſmiled faintly, and, anxious to ſay ſomething, aſked if he had been long in Gaſcony. "A few days only," replied Valancourt, while a bluſh paſſed over his cheek. "I engaged in a long ramble after I had the misfortune of parting with the
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:029378_0055_0FE07ED54ADB1550"/>
friends who had made my wanderings among the Pyrenees ſo delightful."</p>
                     <p>A tear came to Emily's eye, as Valancourt ſaid this, which he obſerved; and, anxious to draw off her attention from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance that had occaſioned it, as well as ſhocked at his own thoughtleſſneſs, he began to ſpeak on other ſubjects; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing his admiration of the chateau, and its proſpects. Emily, who felt ſomewhat embarraſſed how to ſupport a converſation, was glad of ſuch an opportunity to continue it on indifferent topics. They walked down to the terrace, where Valancourt was charmed with the river ſcenery, and the views over the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite ſhores of Guienne.</p>
                     <p>As he leaned on the wall of the terrace, watching the rapid current of the Garonne. "I was a few weeks ago," ſaid he, "at the ſource of this noble river; I had not then the happineſs of knowing you, or I ſhould have regretted your abſence—it was a ſcene ſo exactly ſuited to your taſte. It riſes in a part of the Pyrenees, ſtill wilder and more ſublime, I think, than any we paſſed in the way to Roufillon." He then deſcribed its fall among the precipices of the mountains, where its waters, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the ſtreams that deſcend from the ſnowy ſummits around, ruſh into the Vallee d'Aran, between whoſe romantic heights it foams along, purſuing its way to the north weſt till it emerges upon the plains of Languedoc. Then, waſhing the walls of Tholouſe, and turning again to the north weſt, it aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes a milder character, as it fertilizes the paſtures of Gaſcony and Guienne, in its progreſs to the Bay of Biſcay.</p>
                     <p>Emily and Valancourt talked of the ſcenes they had paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Pyrenean Alps: as he ſpoke of which there was often a tremulous tenderneſs in his voice, and ſometimes he expatiated <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Her ſilence, at length, reminded Valancourt how nearly his converſation ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached to the occaſion of her grief, and he changed the ſubject, though for one ſcarcely leſs affecting to Emily. When he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired the grandeur of the plane-tree, that ſpread its wide bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches over the terrace, and under whoſe ſhade they now ſat, ſhe remembered how often ſhe had ſat thus with St. Aubert, and heard him expreſs the ſame admiration.</p>
                     <p>

Theſe moments may never return, I cannot reſolve to neglect, though I ſcarcely dare to avail myſelf of them. Let me, however, without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the delicacy of your ſorrow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> venture to declare the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration I muſt always feel of your goodneſs—O! that at ſome future period I might be permitted to call it love!"</p>
                     <p>Emily's emotion would not ſuffer her to reply; and Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court, who now ventured to look up, obſerving her countenance change, expected to ſee her faint, and made an involuntary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to ſupport her, which recalled Emily to a ſenſe of her ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and to an exertion of her ſpirits. Valancourt did not appear to notice her indiſpoſition, but when he ſpoke again, his voice told the tendereſt love. "I will not preſume," he added, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                     <p>Emily made another effort to overcome the confuſion of her thoughts, and to ſpeak. She feared to truſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>he preference her heart acknowledged towards Valancourt, and to give him any encouragement for hope, on ſo ſhort an acquaintance. For though in this narrow period ſhe had obſerved much that was admirable in his taſte and diſpoſition, and though theſe obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations had been ſanctioned by the opinion of her father, they were not ſufficient teſtimonies of his general worth to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine her upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

and heſitate ſtill more to encourage that ſuit, for which her own heart too tenderly pleaded. The family of Valancourt, if not his circumſtances, had been known to her father, and known to be unexceptionable. Of his circumſtances, Valancourt himſelf hinted as far as delicacy would permit, when he ſaid he had at preſent little elſe to offer but an heart that adored her. He had ſolicited only for a diſtant hope, and ſhe could not reſolve to forbid, though ſhe ſcarcely dared to permit it; at length, ſhe acquired courage to ſay, that ſhe muſt think herſelf honoured by the good opinion of any perſon, whom her father had eſteemed.</p>
                     <p>"And was I, then, thought worthy of his eſteem?" ſaid Valancourt, in a voice trembling with anxiety; then checking himſelf, he added, "But pardon the queſtion; I ſcarcely know what I ſay. If I might dare to hope, that you think me not unworthy ſuch honour, and might be permitted ſometimes to inquire after your health, I ſhould now leave you with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative tranquillity."</p>
                     <p>Emily, after a moment's ſilence, ſaid, "I will be ingenuous with you, for I know you will underſtand, and allow for my ſituation; you will conſider it as a proof of my—my eſteem that I am ſo. Though I live here in what was my father's houſe, I live here alone. I have, alas! no longer a parent—a parent whoſe preſence might ſanction your viſits. It is unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for me to point out the impropriety of my receiving them."</p>
                     <p>"Nor will I affect to be inſenſible of thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I diſtreſs you, and would now leave the ſubject, if I might carry with me a hope of being ſometime permitted to renew it, of being allowed to make myſelf known to your family."</p>
                     <p>Emily was again confuſed, and again heſitated what to reply; ſhe felt moſt acutely the difficulty—the forlornneſs of her ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which did not allow her a ſingle relative, or friend, to whom ſhe could turn for even a look, that might ſupport and guide her in the preſent embarraſſing circumſtances. Madame Cheron, who was her only relative, and ought to have been this friend, was either occupied by her own amuſements, or ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentful of the reluctance her niece had ſhewn to quit La Vallee, that ſhe ſeemed totally to have abandoned her.</p>
                     <p>"Ah!

                     <p>Emily inquired how long Valancourt had been in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood. "Several days," he replied. It was my deſign to

avail myſelf of the permiſſion M. St. Aubert had given me. I ſcarcely know how to account for it; but, though I anxiouſly wiſhed to do this, my reſolution always failed when the moment approached, and I conſtantly deferred my viſit. I lodged in a village at ſome diſtance, and wandered with my dogs, among the ſcenes of this charming country, wiſhing continually to meet you, yet not daring to viſit you."</p>
                     <p>Having thus continued to converſe, without perceiving the flight of time, Valancourt, at length ſeemed to recollect himſelf. "I muſt go," ſaid he mournfully, "but it is with the hope of ſeeing you again, of being permitted to pay my reſpects to your family; let me hear this hope confirmed by your voice." My family will be happy to ſee any friend of my dear father," ſaid Emily. Valancourt kiſſed her hand, and ſtill lingered unable to depart, while Emily ſat ſilently with her eyes bent on the ground; and Valancourt as he gazed on her, conſidered that it would ſoon be impoſſible fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"My looks do me injuſtice then, Madam, my loſs I know can never be recovered."</p>

After a few moments he took leave of Emily, in a manner, that haſtily expreſſed his pain both at his own departure, and at leaving her to the ſociety of Madame Cheron.</p>
                     <p>"Who is that young man?" ſaid her aunt, in an accent, which equally implied inquiſitiveneſs and cenſure. "Some idle

                     <p>Emily, extremely ſhocked at this coarſe ſpeech, attempted to interrupt it; but Madame Cheron would proceed, with all the ſelf importance of a perſon to whom power is new.</p>
                     <p>"It is very neceſſary you ſhould be under the eye of ſome perſon more able to guide you than yourſelf. I, indeed, have not much leiſure for ſuch a taſk; however, ſince your poor father made it his laſt requeſt, that I ſhould overlook your conduct—I muſt even take you under my care. But this let me tell you niece, that, unleſs you will determine to be very conformable to my direction, I ſhall not trouble myſelf longer about you."</p>
                     <p>Emily made no attempt to interrupt Madame Cheron a ſecond time, grief and the pride of conſcious innocence kept her ſilent, till her aunt ſaid, "I am now come to take you with me to Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am ſorry to find, that your poor father died, after all, in ſuch indifferent circumſtances; however.

                     <p>"Nor has he done ſo, I hope, madam," ſaid Emily calmly, "nor did his pecuniary misfortunes ariſe from that noble gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity, which always diſtinguiſhed him. The affairs of M. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"No doubt you would," replied Madame Cheron, with a ſmile of irony, "and I ſhall no doubt conſent to this, ſince I ſee how neceſſary tranquillity and retirement are to reſtore your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.

                     <p>Emily could no longer endure theſe cruel indignities. "It was a juſt one, madam," ſaid ſhe; "and now, indeed, I feel more than ever the value of retirement I then ſolicited; and if th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"I ſee that I have undertaken a very troubleſome taſk," ſaid Madame Cheron, colouring highly. "I am ſure, madam," ſaid

Emily mildly, and endeavouring to reſtrain her tears, "I am ſure my father did not mean it ſhould be ſuch. I have the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to reflect, that my conduct under his eye was ſuch as he often delighted to approve. It would be very painful to me to diſobey the ſiſter of ſuch a parent, and, if you believe the taſk will really be ſo troubleſome, I muſt lament, that it is yours."</p>
                     <p>"Well niece, fine ſpeaking ſignifies little. I am willing, in conſideration of my poor brother, to overlook the impropriety of your late conduct, and to try what your future will be."</p>
                     <p>Emily interrupted her, to beg ſhe would explain what was the impropriety ſhe alluded to.</p>
                     <p>"What impropriety! why that of receiving the viſits of a lover unknown to your family," replied Madame Cheron, not conſidering the impropriety of which ſhe had herſelf been guilty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in expoſing her niece to the poſſibility of conduct ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>A faint bluſh paſſed over Emily's countenance; pride and anxiety ſtruggled in her breaſt; and, till ſhe recollected, that appearances did, in ſome degree, juſtify her aunt's ſuſpicions, ſhe could not reſolve to humble herſelf ſo far as to enter into the defence of a conduct, which had been ſo innocent and undeſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on her part. She mentioned the manner of Valancourt's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction to her father; the circumſtance of his receiving the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"And who is this young adventurer, pray?" ſaid Madame Cheron, "and what are his pretenſions?" Theſe he muſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf explain, madam," replied Emily. "Of his family my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was not ignorant, and I believe it is unexceptionable." She then proceeded to mention what ſhe knew concerning it.</p>
                     <p>"O, then, this it ſeems is a younger brother," exclaimed her aunt, "and of courſe a beggar. A very fine tale indeed! And ſo my brother took a fancy to this young man after only a few days acquaintance!—but that was ſo like him! In his youth he was always taking theſe likes and diſlikes, when no other perſon ſaw any reaſon for them at all; nay, indeed, I have often thought the people he diſapproved were much more agreeable than thoſe he admired; but there is no accounting for taſtes. He was always ſo much influenced by people's countenances; now I, for my part, have no notion of this, it is all ridiculous enthuſiaſm. What has a man's face to do with his character? Can a man of good

character help having a diſagreeable face?" which laſt ſentence Madame Cheron delivered with the deciſive air of a perſon who congratulates herſelf on having made a grand diſcovery, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves the queſtion to be unanſwerably ſettled.</p>
                     <p>Emily, deſirous of concluding the converſation, inquired if her aunt would accept ſome refreſhment, and Madame Cheron ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied her to the chateau, but without deſiſting from a topic, which ſhe diſcuſſed with ſo much complacency to herſelf, and ſeverity to her niece.</p>
                     <p>"I am ſorry to perceive, niece," ſaid ſhe, in alluſion to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that Emily had ſaid, concerning phyſiognomy, "that you have a great many of your father's prejudices, and among them are thoſe ſudden predilections for people from their looks. I can perceive that you imagine yourſelf to be violently in love with this young adventurer, after an acquaintance of only a few days. There was ſomething too, ſo charmingly romantic in the manner of your meeting!"</p>
                     <p>Emily checked the tears that trembled in her eyes, while ſhe ſaid, "When my conduct ſhall deſerve this ſeverity, madam, you will do well to exerciſe it; till then juſtice, if not tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhould ſurely reſtrain it.

Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame Cheron, more offended by the reproof, which Emily's words conveyed, than touched by the ſorrow they expreſſed, ſaid nothing, that might ſoften her grief; but, notwithſtanding as apparent reluctance to receive her niece, ſhe deſired her company. The love of ſway was her ruling paſſion, and ſhe knew it would be highly gratified by taking into her houſe a young orphan, who had no appeal from her deciſions, and on whom ſhe could exerciſe, without controul, the capricious humour of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>On entering the chateau, Madame Cheron expreſſed a deſire, that ſhe ſhould put up what ſhe thought neceſſary to take to Tholouſe, as ſhe meant to ſet off immediately.

The day paſſed in the exerciſe of petty tyranny on the part of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame Cheron, and in mournful regret and melancholy anticipation o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> that of Emily, who, when her aunt retired to her apartment for the night, went to take leave of every other room in this her dear native home, which ſhe was now quitting, for ſhe knew not how long, and for a world, to which ſhe was wholly a ſtranger. She could not conquer a preſentiment, which frequently occurred to her, this night—that ſhe ſhould never more return to La Vallee. Having paſſed a conſiderable time in what had been her father's ſtudy, having ſelected ſome of his favourite authors, to put up with her clothes, and ſhed many tears, as ſhe wiped the duſt from their covers, ſhe ſeated herſelf in his chair before the reading deſk, and ſat loſt in melancholy reflection, till Thereſa opened the door, to examine, as was her cuſtom before ſhe went to bed, if all was ſafe. She ſtarted, on obſerving her young lady, who bade her come in, and then gave her ſome directions, for keeping the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> in readineſs for her reception at all times.</p>
                     <p>"Alas-a-day! that you ſhould leave it!" ſaid Thereſa, "I think you would be happier here than where you are going, if one may judge." Emily made no reply to this remark; the ſorrow Thereſa proceeded to expreſs at her departure affected her, but ſhe found ſome comfort in the ſimple affection of this poor old ſervant, to whom ſhe gave ſuch directions as might beſt conduce to her comfort, during her own abſence.</p>
                     <p>Having diſmiſſed Thereſa to bed, Emily wandered through every lonely apartment of the chateau, lingering long in what had been her father's bed room, indulging melancholy, yet not unpleaſing emotions, and, having often returned within the door to take another look at it, ſhe withdrew to her own chamber. From her window ſhe gazed upon the garden below, ſhewn faintly by the moon, riſing over the tops of the palm-trees, and, at length, the calm beauty of the night increaſed a deſire of indulging the mournful ſweetneſs of bidding farewel to the beloved ſhades of her childhood, till ſhe was tempted to deſcend. Throwing over her the light veil, in which ſhe uſually walked, ſhe ſilently paſſed into the garden, and, haſtening towards the diſtant groves, was glad to breathe once more the air of liberty, and to ſigh unob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. The deep repoſe of the ſcene, the rich ſcents, that floated on the breeze, the grandeur of the wide horizon and of the clear blue arch, ſoothed, and gradually elevated her mind to that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blime complacency, which renders the vexations of this world ſo inſignificant and mean in our eyes, that we wonder they have had power for a moment to diſturb us. Emily forgot Madame Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:029378_0060_0FE07F0CEB14FDE0"/>
and all the circumſtances of her conduct, while her thoughts aſcended to the contemplation of thoſe unnumbered worlds, that lie ſcattered in the depths of aether, thouſands of them hid from human eyes, and almoſt beyond the flight of human fancy. As her imagination ſoared through the regions of ſpace, and aſpired to that Great Firſt Cauſe, which pervades and governs all being, the idea of her father ſcarcely ever left her; but it was a pleaſing idea, ſince ſhe reſigned him to God in the full confidence of a pure and holy faith. She purſued her way through the groves to the terrace, often pauſing as memory awakened the pang of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and as reaſon anticipated the exile, into which ſhe was going.</p>
                     <p>And now the moon was high over the woods, touching their ſummits with yellow light, and darting between the foliage long level beams; while on the rapid Garonne below the trembling radiance was faintly obſcured by the lighteſt vapour. Emily long watched the playing luſtre, liſtened to the ſoothing murmur of the current, and the yet lighter ſounds of the air, as it ſtirred, at intervals, the lofty palm-trees. "How delightful is the ſweet breath of theſe groves," ſaid ſhe. "This lovely ſcene!—how often ſhall I remember and regret it, when I am far away. Alas! what events may occur, before I ſee it again! O, peaceful, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſhades!—ſcenes of my infant delights, of parental tenderneſs now loſt for ever!—why muſt I leave ye!—In your retreats I ſhould ſtill find ſafety and repoſe. Sweet hours of my childhood, I am now to leave even your laſt memorials! No objects, that would revive your impreſſions, will remain for me!"</p>
                     <p>Then drying her tears and looking up, her thoughts roſe again to the ſublime ſubject ſhe had contemplated; the ſame divine complacency ſtole over her heart, and, huſhing its throbs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired hope and confidence and reſignation to the will of the Deity, whoſe works filled her mind with adoration.</p>
                     <p>Emily gazed long on the plane-tree, and then ſeated herſelf, for the laſt time, on the bench under its ſhade, where ſhe had ſo often ſat with her parents, and where, only a few hours before, ſhe had converſed with Valancourt, at the remembrance of whom, thus revived, a mingled ſenſation of eſteem, tenderneſs and anxiety roſe in her breaſt. With this remembrance occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a recollection of his late confeſſion—that he had often wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered near her habitation in the night, having even paſſed the boundary of the garden, and it immediately occurred to her, that he might be at this moment in the grounds. The fear of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, particularly after the declaration he had made, and of incurring a cenſure, which her aunt might ſo reaſonably beſtow,

if it was known, that ſhe was met by her lover, at this hour, made her inſtantly leave her beloved plane-tree, and walk to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the chateau. She caſt an anxious eye around, and often ſtopped for a moment to examine the ſhadowy ſcene before ſhe ventured to proceed, but ſhe paſſed on without perceiving any perſon, till having reached a clump of almond trees, not far from the houſe, ſhe reſted to take a retroſpect of the garden, and to ſigh forth another adieu. As her eyes wandered over the landſcape ſhe thought ſhe perceived a perſon emerge from the groves, and paſs ſlowly along a moonlight alley that led between them; but the diſtance, and the imperfect light would not ſuffer her to judge with any degree of certainty whether this was fancy or reality. She continued to gaze for ſometime on the ſpot, till on the dead ſtillneſs of the air ſhe heard a ſudden ſound, and in the next inſtant fancied ſhe diſtinguiſhed footſteps near her. Waſting not another moment in conjecture, ſhe hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the chateau, and, having reached it, retired to her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where, as ſhe cloſed her window ſhe looked upon the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and then again thought ſhe diſtinguiſhed a figure, gliding between the almond trees ſhe had juſt left. She immediately withdrew from the caſement, and, though much agitated, ſought in ſleep the refreſhment of a ſhort oblivion.</p>

                     <p>AT an early hour, the carriage, which was to take Emily and Madame Cheron to Tholouſe, appeared at the door of the chateau, and Madame was already in the breakfaſt-room, when her niece entered it. The repaſt was ſilent and melancholy on the part of Emily; and Madame Cheron, whoſe vanity was piqued on obſerving her dejection, reproved her in a manner that did not contribute to remove it. It was with much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance, that Emily's requeſt to take with her the dog, which had been a favourite of her father, was granted. Her aunt, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient

Soon after, ſhe caught, between the ſteep banks of the road, another view of the chateau, peeping from among the high trees, and ſurrounded by green ſlopes and tufted groves, the Garonne winding its way beneath their ſhades, ſometimes loſt among the vineyards, and then riſing in greater majeſty in the diſtant paſtures.

Having gazed on the chateau and its lovely ſcenery, till the banks again cloſed upon them, her mind became too much occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied by mournful reflections, to permit her to attend to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, which Madame Cheron had begun on ſome trivial topic, ſo that they ſoon travelled in profound ſilence.</p>
                     <p>Valancourt, meanwhile was returned to Eſtuviere, his heart occupied with the image of Emily; ſometimes indulging in reveries of future happineſs, but more frequently ſhrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with dread of the oppoſition he might encounter from her family. He was the younger ſon of an ancient family of Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cony; and, having loſt his parents at an early period of his life, the care of his education and of his ſmall portion had devolved to his brother, the Count de Duvarney, his ſenior by nearly twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years. Valancourt had been educated in all the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his age, and had an ardour of ſpirit, and a certain grandeur of mind, that gave him particular excellence in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes then thought heroic. His little fortune had been dimin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed by the neceſſary expences of his education; but M. La Valancourt, the elder, ſeemed to think, that his genius and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments would amply ſupply the deficiency of his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. They offered flattering hopes of promotion in the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary profeſſion, in thoſe times almoſt the only one in which a

gentleman could engage without incurring a ſtain on his name; and La Valancourt was of courſe enrolled in the army. The general genius of his mind was but little underſtood by his brother.

                     <p>At length, theſe unpleaſant lectures were interrupted by the arrival of the travellers at Tholouſe; and Emily, who had not been there for many years, and had only a very faint recollection of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was ſurpriſed at the oſtentatious ſtyle exhibited in her aunt's houſe and furniture; the more ſo, perhaps, becauſe it was ſo totally different from the modeſt elegance, to which ſhe had been

She knew nothing of the conduct of a mind, that fears to truſt its own powers; which poſſeſſing a nice judgment, and incl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Emily had frequently bluſhed at the fearleſs manners, which ſhe had ſeen admired, and the brilliant nothings, which ſhe had heard applauded; yet this applauſe, ſo far from encouraging her to imitate the conduct that had won it, rather made her ſhrink into the reſerve, that would protect her from ſuch abſurdity.</p>
                     <p>Madame Cheron looked on her niece's diffidence with a feeling very near to contempt, and endeavoured to overcome it by reproof, rather than to encourage it by gentleneſs.</p>
                     <p>The entrance of ſupper ſomewhat interrupted the complacent diſcourſe of Madame Cheron and the painful conſiderations, which it had forced upon Emily. When the repaſt, which was rendered oſtentatious by the attendance of a great number of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and by a profuſion of plate, was over, Madame Cheron re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to her chamber, and a female ſervant came to ſhew Emily

                     <p>When the company arrived, Emily entered the ſaloon with an air of timidity, which all her efforts could not overcome, and which was increaſed by the conſciouſneſs of Madame Cheron's ſevere obſervation. Her mourning dreſs, the mild dejection of her beautiful countenance, and the retiring diffidence of her manner, rendered her a very intereſting object to many of the company; among whom ſhe diſtinguiſhed Signor Montoni, and his friend Cavigni, the late viſitors at M. Queſnel's who now ſeemed to converſe with Madame Cheron with the familiarity of old acquaintance, and ſhe to attend to them with particular pleaſure.

Valancourt, in air and figure, for the twilight did not permit a view of his features, immediately ſtruck her. She retired haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the lattice, fearing to be ſeen, yet wiſhing to obſerve further, while the ſtranger paſſed on without looking up, and, when ſhe returned to the lattice, ſhe ſaw him faintly through the twilight, winding under the high trees, that led to Tholouſe. This little incident ſo much diſturbed her ſpirits, that the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and its ſcenery were no longer intereſting to her, and, after walking awhile on the terrace, ſhe returned to the chateau.</p>
                     <p>Madame Cheron, whether ſhe had ſeen a rival admired, had loſt at play, or had witneſſed an entertainment more ſplendid than her own, was returned from her viſit with a temper more than uſually diſcompoſed; and Emily was glad, when the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> arrived, in which ſhe could retire to the ſolitude of her own apartment.</p>
                     <p>On the following morning, ſhe was ſummoned to Madame Cheron, whoſe countenance was inflamed with reſentment, and, as Emily advanced, ſhe held out a letter to her.</p>
                     <p>"Do you know this hand?" ſaid ſhe, in a ſevere tone, and with a look that was intended to ſearch her heart, while Emily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined the letter attentively, and aſſured her that ſhe did not.</p>
                     <p>"Do not provoke me," ſaid her aunt; "you do know it, confeſs the truth immediately. I inſiſt upon your confeſſing the truth inſtantly."</p>
                     <p>Emily was ſilent, and turned to leave the room, but Madame called her back. "O you are guilty then," ſaid ſhe, "you do know the hand." "If you was before in doubt of this, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam," replied Emily calmly, "why did you accuſe me of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing told a falſehood." Madame Cheron did not bluſh; but her niece did, a moment after, when ſhe heard the name of Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court. It was not, however, with the conſciouſneſs of deſerving reproof, for, if ſhe ever had ſeen his hand-writing, the preſent characters did not bring it to her recollection.</p>
                     <p>"It is uſeleſs to deny it," ſaid Madame Cheron, "I ſee in your countenance, that you are no ſtranger to this letter; and I dare ſay, you have received many ſuch from this impertinent young man, without my knowledge, in my own houſe."</p>
                     <p>Emily, ſhocked at the indelicacy of this accuſation, ſtill more than by the vulgarity of the former, inſtantly forgot the pride, that had impoſed ſilence, and endeavoured to vindicate herſelf from the aſperſion, but Madame Cheron was not to be convinced.</p>
                     <p>"I cannot ſuppoſe," ſhe reſumed, "that this young man would have taken the liberty of writing to me, if you had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"His family was known to my father," ſaid Emily modeſtly; and without appearing to be ſenſible of the laſt ſentence.</p>

She knew, that ſhe did not deſerve the coarſe ſuſpicions, which her aunt had thrown out, but a thouſand ſcruples roſe to torment her, ſuch as would never have diſturbed the peace of Madame Cheron. Thus rendered anxious to avoid every opportunity of erring, and willing to ſubmit to any reſtrictions that her aunt ſhould think proper, ſhe expreſſed an obedience, to which Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ame Cheron did not give much confidence, and which ſhe ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to conſider as the conſequence of either fear, or artifice.</p>
                     <p>"Well then," ſaid ſhe, "promiſe me that you will neither ſee this young man, nor write to him without my conſent." "Dear, madam," replied Emily, "can you ſuppoſe I would do either unknown to you!" "I don't know what to ſuppoſe; there is no knowing how young women will act. It is difficult to place any confidence in them, for they have ſeldom ſenſe enough to wiſh for the reſpect of the world."</p>
                     <p>"Alas, madam!" ſaid Emily, "I am anxious for my own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; my father taught me the value of that; he ſaid if I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved my own eſteem, that of the world would follow of courſe."</p>
                     <p>"My brother was a good kind of a man," replied Madame Cheron, "but he did not know the world. I am ſure I have always felt a proper reſpect for myſelf, yet—" She ſtopped, but ſhe might have added, that the world had not always ſhewn reſpect to her, and this without impeaching its judgment.</p>
                     <p>"Well!" reſumed Madame Cheron, "you have not given me the promiſe, though, that I demand." Emily readily gave it, and, being then ſuffered to withdraw, ſhe walked in the garden; tried to compoſe her ſpirits, and, at length, arrived at her favourite pavilion at the end of the terrace, where, ſeating herſelf at one of the embowered windows, that opened upon a balcony, the ſtill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſecluſion of the ſcene allowed her to recollect her thoughts, and to arrange them ſo as to form a clearer judgment of her former conduct. She endeavoured to review with exactneſs all the particulars of her converſation with Valancourt at La Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee, had the ſatisfaction to obſerve nothing that could alarm her delicate pride, and thus to be confirmed in the ſelf eſteem, which was ſo neceſſary to her peace. Her mind then became tranquil, and ſhe ſaw Valancourt amiable and intelligent, as h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The remembrance of her lover, however, brought with it many very painful emotions, for it by no means reconciled her to the thought of reſigning him; and, Madame Cheron hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already ſhewn how highly ſhe diſapproved of the attachment, ſhe foreſaw much ſuffering from the oppoſition of intereſts; yet
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:029378_0066_0FE07F49492775C8"/>
with all this was mingled a degree of delight, which, in ſpite of reaſon, partook of hope. She determined, however, that no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration ſhould induce her to permit a clandeſtine correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and to obſerve in her converſation with Valancourt, ſhould they ever meet again, the ſame nicety of reſerve, which had hitherto marked her conduct. As ſhe repeated the words—"ſhould we ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

An emotion of mingled pleaſure, ſurpriſe and apprehenſion preſſed ſo ſuddenly upon her heart as almoſt to overcome her ſpirits; the colour left her cheeks, then returned brighter than before, and ſhe was for a moment unable to ſpeak, or to riſe from her chair. His countenance was the mirror, in which ſhe ſaw her own emotions reflected, and it rouſed her to ſelf command. The joy which had animated his features, when he entered the pavilion, was ſuddenly repreſſed, as, approaching, he perceived her agitation, and, in a tremulous voice, inquired after her health. Recovered from her firſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, ſhe anſwered him with a tempered ſmile; but a variety of oppoſite emotions ſtill aſſailed her heart, and ſtruggled to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the mild dignity of her manner. It was difficult to tell which predominated—the joy of ſeeing Valancourt, or the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

After ſome ſhort and embarraſſed converſation, ſhe led him into the gardens, and inquired if he had ſeen Madame Cheron." "No," ſaid he, "I have not yet ſeen her, for they told me ſhe was engaged, and as ſoon as I learned that you were in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, I came hither." He pauſed a moment in great agitation, and then added, "May I venture to tell you the purport of my viſit, without incurring your diſpleaſure, and to hope, that you will not accuſe me of precipitation in now availing myſelf of the permiſſion you once gave me of addreſſing your family?" Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who knew not what to reply, was ſpared from further per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, and was ſenſible only of fear, when, on raiſing her eyes, ſhe ſaw Madame Cheron turn into the avenue. As the conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of innocence returned, this fear was ſo far diſſipated as to permit her to appear tranquil, and, inſtead of avoiding her aunt, ſhe advanced with Valancourt to meet her. The look of haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and impatient diſpleaſure, with which Madame Cheron re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded them, made Emily ſhrink, who underſtood from a ſingle glance, that this meeting was believed to have been more

than accidental: having mentioned Valancourt's name, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came again too much agitated to remain with them, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the chateau; where ſhe awaited long, in a ſtate of trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling anxiety, the concluſion of the conference. She knew not how to account for Valancourt's viſit to her aunt, before he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, ſo that it was impoſſible for Madame Cheron to return <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Madame Cheron had a long converſation with Valancourt, and, when ſhe returned to the chateau, her countenance expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ill humour, but not the degree of ſeverity, which Emily <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"Dear madam!" ſaid Emily in extreme emotion, "you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"Good God!" exclaimed Emily, "what an opinion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

                     <p>"It is of very little conſequence what opinion he may form of you," replied her aunt, "for I have put an end to the affair; but I believe he will not form a worſe opinion of me for my prudent conduct. I let him ſee, that I was not to be trifled with; and that I had more delicacy, than to permit any clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine correſpondence to be carried on in my houſe."</p>
                     <p>Emily had frequently heard Madame Cheron uſe the word de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy, but, ſhe was now more than uſually perplexed to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how ſhe meant to apply it in this inſtance, in which her whole conduct appeared to merit the very reverſe of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Emily dried her tears when ſhe heard of the candid confeſſion of Valancourt; and though the circumſtances it diſcovered were afflicting to her hopes, his artleſs conduct gave her a degree of pleaſure, that overcame every other emotion. But ſhe was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, even thus early in life, to obſerve, that good ſenſe and noble integrity are not always ſufficient to cope with folly and narrow cunning; and her heart was pure enough to allow her, even at this trying moment, to look with more pride on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat of the former, than with mortification on the conqueſts of the latter.</p>
                     <p>Madame Cheron purſued her triumph.—"He has alſo thought proper to tell me, that he will receive his diſmiſſion from no perſon but yourſelf; this favour, however, I have abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed him. He ſhall learn, that it is quite ſufficient, that I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approve him. And I take this opportunity of repeating,—that if you concert any means of interview unknown to me, you ſhall leave my houſe immediately."</p>
                     <p>"How little do you know me, madam, that you ſhould think ſuch an injunction neceſſary!" ſaid Emily, trying to ſuppreſs her emotion "how little of the dear parents who educated me!"</p>
                     <p>Madame Cheron now went to dreſs for an engagment, which ſhe had made for the evening; and Emily, who would gladly have been excuſed from attending her aunt, did not aſk to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main at home leſt her requeſt ſhould be attributed to an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per motive. When ſhe retired to her own room, the little for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, which had ſupported her in the preſence of her relation, forſook her; ſhe remembered only that Valancourt, whoſe char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter appeared more amiable from every circumſtance, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded it, was baniſhed from her preſence, perhaps, for ever, and ſhe paſſed the time in weeping, which, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>ording to her aunt's direction, ſhe ought to have employed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Her efforts to appear cheerful did not intirely fail when ſhe joined the company at the houſe of Madame Clairval, an elderly widow lady, who had lately come to reſide at Tholouſe, on an eſtate of her late huſband. She had lived many years at Paris
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:029378_0068_0FE07F5D773112F8"/>
in a ſplendid ſtyle; had naturally a gay temper, and ſince her reſidence at Tholouſe, had given ſome of the moſt magnificent entertainments, that had been ſeen in that neighbourhood.</p>
                     <p>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſe excited not only the envy, but the trifling ambition of Madame Cheron, who, ſince ſhe could not rival the ſplendour of her feſtivities, was deſirous of being ranked in the number of her moſt intimate friends. For this purpoſe ſhe paid her the moſt obſequious attention, and made a point of being diſengaged, whenever ſhe received an invitation from Madame Clairval, of whom ſhe talked, wherever ſhe went, and derived much ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence from impreſſing a belief on her general acquaintance, that they were on the moſt familiar footing.</p>
                     <p>The entertainments of this evening conſiſted of a ball and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; it was a fancy ball, and the company danced in groups in the gardens, which were very extenſive. The high and luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant trees, under which the groups aſſembled, were illuminated with a profuſion of lamps, diſpoſed with taſte and fancy. The gay and various dreſſes of the company, ſome of whom were ſeated on the turf, converſing at their eaſe, obſerving the cotil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons, taking refreſhments, and ſometimes touching ſportively a guitar; the gallant manners of the gentlemen, the exquiſitely capricious air of the ladies; the light fantaſtic ſteps of their dances; the muſicians with the lute, the hautboy, and the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, ſeated at the foot of an elm, and the ſylvan ſcenery of woods around, were circumſtances, that tunitedly formed a char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acteriſtic and ſtriking picture of French feſtivity. Emily ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed the gaiety of the ſcene with a melancholy kind of pleaſure, and her emotion may be imagined when, as ſhe ſtood with her aunt, looking at one of the groups, ſhe perceived Valancourt; ſaw him dancing with a young and beautiful lady, ſaw him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with her with a mixture of attention and familiarity, ſuch as ſhe had ſeldom obſerved in his manner. She turned haſtily from the ſcene, and attempted to draw away Madame Cheron, who was converſing with Signor Cavigni, and neither perceived Valancourt, or was willing to be interrupted. A faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſuddenly came over Emily, and, unable to ſupport herſelf, ſhe ſat down on a turf bank beneath the trees, where ſeveral other perſons were ſeated. One of theſe, obſerving the extreme paleneſs of her countenance, inquired if ſhe was ill, and begged ſhe would allow him to fetch her a glaſs of water, for which po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs ſhe thanked him, but did not accept it. Her apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion leſt Valancourt ſhould obſerve her emotion made her anxious to overcome it, and ſhe ſucceeded ſo far as to recompoſe her
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:029378_0068_0FE07F5D773112F8"/>
countenance. Madame Cheron was ſtill converſing with Cavig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni; and the Count Bauvillers, who had addreſſed Emily, made ſome obſervations upon the ſcene, to which ſhe anſwered almoſt unconſciouſly, for her mind was ſtill occupied with the idea of Valancourt, to whom it was with extreme uneaſineſs that ſhe remained ſo near. Some remarks, however, which the Count made upon the dance obliged her to turn her eyes towards it, and, at that moment, Valancourt's met hers. Her colour faded again, ſhe felt that ſhe was relapſing into faintneſs, and inſtantly averted her looks, but not before ſhe had obſerved the altered countenance of Valancourt, on perceiving her. She would have left the ſpot immediately, had ſhe not been conſcious, that this conduct would have ſhewn him more obviouſly the intereſt he held in her heart; and, having tried to attend to the Count's converſation and to join in it, ſhe, at length, recovered her ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. But, when he made ſome obſervation on Valancourt's partner, the fear of ſhewing, that ſhe was intereſted in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, would have betrayed it to him, had not the Count, while he ſpoke, looked towards the perſon of whom he was ſpeaking. "The lady," ſaid he, "dancing with that young chevalier, who appears to be accompliſhed in every thing, but in dancing, is ranked among the beauties of Tholouſe. She is handſome, and her fortune will be very large. I hope ſhe will make a better choice in a partner for life than ſhe has done in a partner for the dance, for I obſerve he has juſt put the ſet into great confuſion; he does nothing but commit blunders. I am ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, that, with his air and figure, he has not taken more care to accompliſh himſelf in dancing."</p>
                     <p>Emily, whoſe heart trembled at every word, that was now ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, endeavoured to turn the converſation from Valancourt, by inquiring the name of the lady, with whom he danced; but, before the Count could reply, the dance concluded, and Emily, perceiving that Valancourt was coming towards her, roſe and joined Madame Cheron.</p>
                     <p>"Here is the Chevalier Valancourt, madam," ſaid ſhe in a whiſper, "pray let us go." Her aunt immediately moved on, but not before Valancourt had reached them, who bowed lowly to Madame Cheron, and with an earneſt and dejected look to Emily, with whom, notwithſtanding all her effort, an air of more than common reſerve prevailed. The preſence of Madame Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron prevented Valancourt from remaining, and he paſſed on with a countenance, whoſe melancholy reproached her for having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed it. Emily was called from the muſing fit, into which ſhe had fallen, by the Count Bauvillers, who was known to her aunt.
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:029378_0069_0FE07F626070BBB8"/>
"I have your pardon to beg, ma'amſelle," ſaid he, "for a rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which you will readily believe was quite unintentional.—I did not know, that the Chevalier was your acquaintance, when I ſo freely criticiſed his dancing." Emily bluſhed and ſmiled, and Madame Cheron ſpared her the difficulty of replying. "If you mean the perſon, who has juſt paſſed us," ſaid ſhe, "I can aſſure you he is no acquaintance of either mine, or ma'amſelle St. Aubert's: I know nothing of him."</p>
                     <p>"O! that is the chevalier Valancourt," ſaid Cavigni care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsly and looking back. "You know him then?" ſaid Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ame Cheron. "I am not acquainted with him," replied Cav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igni. "You don't know, then, the reaſon I have to call him impertinent;—he has had the preſumption to admire my niece!"</p>
                     <p>"If every man deſerves the title of impertinent, who admires ma'amſelle St. Aubert," replied Cavigni, "I fear there are a great many impertinents, and I am willing to acknowledge my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf one of the number."</p>
                     <p>"O ſignor!" ſaid Madame Cheron, with an affected ſmile, "I perceive you have learnt the art of complimenting, ſince you came into France. But it is cruel to compliment children, ſince they miſtake flattery for truth."</p>
                     <p>Cavigni turned away his face for a moment, and then ſaid with a ſtudied air, "Whom then are we to compliment, mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am? for it would be abſurd to compliment a woman of refined underſtanding; <hi>ſhe</hi> is above all praiſe." As he finiſhed the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence he gave Emily a ſly look, and the ſmile that had lurked in his eye, ſtole forth. She perfectly underſtood it, and bluſhed for Madame Cheron, who replied, "You are perfectly right, ſignor, no woman of underſtanding can endure compliment."</p>
                     <p>"I have heard ſignor Montoni ſay," rejoined Cavigni, "that he never knew but one woman who deſerved it."</p>
                     <p>"Well!" exclaimed Madame Cheron, with a ſhort laugh, and a ſmile of unutterable complacency, "and who could ſhe be?"</p>
                     <p>"O!" replied Cavigni, "it is impoſſible to miſtake her, for certainly there is not more than one woman in the world, who has both the merit to deſerve compliment and the wit to refuſe it. Moſt women reverſe the caſe intirely." He looked again at Emily, who bluſhed deeper than before for her aunt, and turned from him with diſpleaſure.</p>
                     <p>"Well, ſignor!" ſaid Madame Cheron, "I proteſt you are a Frenchman; I never heard a foreigner ſay any thing half ſo gallant as that!"</p>
                     <p>"True, madam," ſaid the Count, who had been ſometime ſilent, and with a low bow, "but the gallantry of the compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:029378_0069_0FE07F626070BBB8"/>
had been utterly loſt, but for the ingenuity that diſcovered the application."</p>
                     <p>Madame Cheron did not perceive the meaning of this too ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>irical ſentence, and ſhe, therefore, eſcaped the pain, which Emily felt on her account. "O! here comes ſignor Montoni himſelf," ſaid her aunt, "I proteſt I will tell him all the fine things you have been ſaying to me." The ſignor, however, paſſed at this moment into another walk. "Pray, who is it, that has ſo much engaged your friend this evening?" aſked Madame Cheron, with an air of chagrin, "I have not ſeen him once."</p>
                     <p>"He had a very particular engagement with the Marquis La Riviere," replied Cavigni, "which has detained him, I perceive till this moment, or he would have done himſelf the honour of paying his reſpects to you, madam, ſooner, as he commiſſioned me to ſay. But I know not how it is—your converſation is ſo faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinating—that it can charm even memory, I think, or I ſhould certainly have delivered my friend's apology before."</p>
                     <p>"The apology, ſir, would have been more ſatisfactory from himſelf," ſaid Madame Cheron, whoſe vanity was more mortified by Montoni's neglect, than flattered by Cavigni's compliment. Her manner, at this moment, and Cavigni's late converſation, now awakened a ſuſpicion in Emily's mind, which, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that ſome recollections ſerved to confirm it, appeared prepoſterous. She thought ſhe perceived, that Montoni was pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſerious addreſſes to her aunt, and that ſhe not only accepted them, but was jealouſly watchful of any appearance of neglect on his part. That Madame Cheron at her years ſhould elect a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond huſband was ridiculous, though her vanity made it not impoſſible; but that Montoni, with his diſcernment, his figure, and pretenſions, ſhould make a choice of Madame Cheron—ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared moſt wonderful. Her thoughts, however, did not dwell long on the ſubject; nearer intereſts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> upon them; Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court, rejected of her aunt, and Valancourt dancing with a gay and beautiful partner, alternately tormented her mind. As ſhe paſſed along the gardens ſhe looked timidly forward, half fearing and half hoping that he might appear in the crowd; and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment ſhe felt on not ſeeing him, told her, that ſhe had hoped more than ſhe had feared.</p>
                     <p>Montoni ſoon after joined the party. He muttered over ſome ſhort ſpeech about regret for having been ſo long detained elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, when he knew he ſhould have the pleaſure of ſeeing Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame Cheron here; and ſhe, receiving the apology with the air of a pettiſh girl, addreſſed herſelf entirely to Cavigni, who look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:029378_0070_0FE07F6DAF34C720"/>
archly at Montoni, as if he would have ſaid, "I will not triumph over you too much; I will have the goodneſs to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ear my honours meekly; but look ſharp, ſignor, or I ſhall certainly run away with your prize."</p>
                     <p>The ſupper was ſerved in different pavilions in the gardens, as well as in one large ſaloon of the chateau, and with more of taſte, than either of ſplendour, or even of plenty. Madame Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron and her party ſupped with Madame Clairval in the ſaloon, and Emily, with difficulty, diſguiſed her emotion, when ſhe ſaw Valancourt placed at the ſame table with herſelf. There, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame Cheron having ſurveyed him with high diſpleaſure, ſaid to ſome perſon who ſat next to her, "Pray who <hi>is</hi> that young man?" "It is the Chevalier Valancourt," was the anſwer. "Yes, I am not ignorant of his name, but who is this Chevalier Valancourt that thus intrudes himſelf at this table?" The at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the perſon, to whom ſhe ſpoke, was called off before ſhe received a ſecond reply. The table, at which they ſat, was very long, and, Valancourt being ſeated, with his partner, near the bottom, and Emily near the top, the diſtance between them may account for his not immediately perceiving her. She avoided looking to that end of the table, but whenever her eyes happened to glance towards it, ſhe obſerved him, converſing with his beautiful companion, and the obſervation did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to reſtore her peace, any more than the accounts ſhe heard of the fortune and accompliſhments of this ſame lady.</p>
                     <p>Madame Cheron, to whom theſe remarks were ſometimes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed, becauſe they ſupported topics for trivial converſation, ſeemed indefatigable in her attempts to depreciate Valancourt, towards whom ſhe felt all the petty reſentment of a narrow pride. "I admire the lady," ſaid ſhe, "but I muſt condemn her choice of a partner." "Oh, the Chevalier Valancourt is one of the moſt accompliſhed young men we have," replied the lady, to whom this remark was addreſſed; "it is whiſpered, that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle D'Emery and her very large fortune are to be his."</p>
                     <p>"Impoſſible!" exclaimed Madame Cheron, reddening with vexation, "it is impoſſible that ſhe can be ſo deſtitute of taſte: he has ſo little the air of a perſon of condition, that, if I did not ſee him at the table of Madame Clairval, I ſhould never have ſuſpected him to be one. I have beſides particular reaſons for believing the report to be erroneous."</p>
                     <p>"I cannot doubt the truth of it," replied the lady gravely, diſguſted by the abrupt contradiction ſhe had received, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her opinion of Valancourt's merit. "You will, perhaps,
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:029378_0070_0FE07F6DAF34C720"/>
doubt it," ſaid Madame Cheron, "when I aſſure you, that it was only this morning that I rejected his ſuit." This was ſaid without any intention of impoſing the meaning it conveyed, but ſimply from a habit of conſidering herſelf to be the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant perſon in every affair that concerned her niece, and becauſe literally ſhe had rejected Valancourt. "Your reaſons are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſuch as cannot be doubted," replied the lady, with an iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical ſmile.—"Any more than the diſcernment of the Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier Valancourt," added Cavigni, who ſtood by the chair of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame Cheron, and had heard her arrogate to herſelf, as he thought, a diſtinction, which had been paid to her niece. "His diſcernment <hi>may</hi> be juſtly queſtioned, ſignor," ſaid Madame Cheron, who was not flattered by what ſhe underſtood to be an encomium upon Emily.</p>
                     <p>"Alas!" exclaimed Cavigni, ſurveying Madame Cheron with affected ecſtacy, "how vain is that aſſertion, while that face—that ſhape—that air—combine to refute it! Unhappy Valancourt! his diſcernment has been his deſtruction."</p>
                     <p>Emily looked ſurpriſed and embarraſſed; the lady, who had lately ſpoken, aſtoniſhed, and Madame Cheron, who, though ſhe did not perfectly underſtand this ſpeech, was very ready to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve herſelf complimented by it, ſaid ſmilingly, "O Signor! you are very gallant; but thoſe, who hear you vindicate the cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier's diſcernment, will ſuppoſe that I am the object of it."</p>
                     <p>"They cannot doubt it," replied Cavigni, bowing low.</p>
                     <p>"And would not that be very mortifying, Signor?"</p>
                     <p>"Unqueſtionably it would," ſaid Cavigni.</p>
                     <p>"I cannot endure the thought," ſaid Madame Cheron.</p>
                     <p>"It is not to be endured," replied Cavigni.</p>
                     <p>"What can be done to prevent ſo humiliating a miſtake?" rejoined Madame Cheron.</p>
                     <p>"Alas! I cannot aſſiſt you," replied Cavigni, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberating air. "Your only chance of refuting the calumny, and of making people underſtand what you wiſh them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, is to perſiſt in your firſt aſſertion; for, when they are told of the chevalier's want of diſcernment, it is poſſible they may ſuppoſe he never preſumed to diſtreſs you with his admiration. But then again—that diffidence, which renders you ſo inſenſible to your own perfections—they will conſider this, and Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court's taſte will not be doubted, though you arraign it. In ſhort, they will, in ſpite of your endeavours, continue to believe, what might very naturally have occurred to them without any hint of mine—that the chevalier has taſte enough to admire a beautiful woman."</p>

                        <pb n="140" facs="unknown:029378_0071_0FE07F7365C85918"/>
"All this is very diſtreſſing!" ſaid Madame Cheron with a profound ſigh.</p>
                     <p>"May I be allowed to aſk what is ſo diſtreſſing?" ſaid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame Clairval, who was ſtruck with the rueful countenance and doleful accent, with which this was delivered.</p>
                     <p>"It is a delicate ſubject," replied Madame Cheron, "a very mortifying one to me." "I am concerned to hear it," ſaid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame Clairval, "I hope nothing has occurred, this evening, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to diſtreſs you?" "Alas, yes! within this half hour; and I know not where the report may end;—my pride was never ſo ſhocked before, but I aſſure you the report is totally void of foundation," "Good God!" exclaimed Madame Clairval, "what can be done? Can you point out any way, by which I can aſſiſt, or conſole you?"</p>
                     <p>"The only way, by which you can do either," replied Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame Cheron, "is to contradict the report wherever you go."</p>
                     <p>"Well! but pray inform me what I am to contradict."</p>
                     <p>"It is ſo very humiliating, that I know not how to mention it," continued Madame Cheron, "but you ſhall judge. Do you obſerve that young man ſeated near the bottom of the table, who is converſing with Mademoiſelle D'Emery?" "Yes, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive whom you mean," "You obſerve how little he has the air of a perſon of condition; I was ſaying juſt now, that I ſhould not have thought him a gentleman, if I had not ſeen him at this table." "Well! but the report," ſaid Madame Clairval, "let me underſtand the ſubject of your diſtreſs." "Ah! the ſubject of my diſtreſs," replied Madame Cheron: "this perſon whom nobody knows—(I beg pardon, madam, I did not conſider what I ſaid) this impertinent young man, having had the preſumption to addreſs my niece, has, I fear, given riſe to a report, that he had declared himſelf my admirer. Now only conſider how very mortifying ſuch a report muſt be! You, I know, will feel for my ſituation. A woman of my condition! think how degrad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing even the rumour of ſuch an alliance muſt be."</p>
                     <p>"Degrading indeed, my poor friend!" ſaid Madame Clairval. "You may rely upon it I will contradict the report wherever I go;" as ſhe ſaid which, ſhe turned her attention upon another part of the company; and Cavigni, who had hitherto appeared a grave ſpectator of the ſcene, now fearing he ſhould be unable to ſmother the laugh, that convulſed him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>alked abruptly away.</p>
                     <p>"I perceive you do not know," ſaid the lady who ſat near Madame Cheron, "that the gentleman you have been ſpeaking of is Madame Clairval's nephew!" "Impoſſible!" exclaimed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:029378_0071_0FE07F7365C85918"/>
Cheron, who now began to perceive that ſhe had been to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally miſtaken in her judgment of Valancourt, and to praiſe him aloud with as much ſervility, as ſhe had before cenſured him with frivolous malignity.</p>
                     <p>Emily, who, during the greater part of this converſation, had been ſo abſorbed in thought as to be ſpared the pain of hearing it, was now extremely ſurpriſed by her aunt's praiſe of Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court, with whoſe relationſhip to Madame Clairval ſhe was unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted; but ſhe was not ſorry when Madame Cheron, who though ſhe now tried to appear unconcerned, was really much embarraſſed, prepared to withdraw immediately after ſupper. Montoni then came to hand Madame Cheron to her carriage, and Cavigni, with an arch ſolemnity of countenance, followed with Emily, who, as ſhe wiſhed them good night, and drew up the glaſs, ſaw Valancourt among the crowd at the gates. Before the carriage drove off, he diſappeared. Madame Cheron for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore to mention him to Emily, and, as ſoon as they reached the chateau, they ſeparated for the night.</p>
                     <p>On the following morning, as Emily ſat at breakfaſt with her aunt, a letter was brought to her, of which ſhe knew the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing upon the cover; and, as ſhe received it with a trembling hand, Madame Cheron haſtily inquired from whom it came. Emily, with her leave broke the ſeal, and, obſerving the ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Valancourt, gave it unread to her aunt, who received it with impatience; and, as ſhe looked it over, Emily endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to read on her countenance its contents. Having returned the letter to her niece, whoſe eyes aſked if ſhe might examine it, "Yes, read it, child," ſaid Madame Cheron, in a manner leſs ſevere than ſhe had expected, and Emily had, perhaps, never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo willingly obeyed her aunt. In this letter Valancourt ſaid little of the interview of the preceding day, but concluded with declaring, that he would accept his diſmiſſion from Emily only, and with intreating, that ſhe would allow him to wait upon her, on the approaching evening. When ſhe read this, ſhe was aſtoniſhed at the moderation of Madame Cheron, and looked at her with timid expectation, as ſhe ſaid ſorrowfully—"What am I to ſay, madam?"</p>
                     <p>"Why—we muſt ſee the young man, I believe," replied her aunt, "and hear what he has further to ſay for himſelf. You may tell him he may come." Emily dared ſcarcely credit what ſhe heard. "Yet, ſtay," added Madame Cheron, "I will tell him ſo myſelf." She called for pen and ink; Emily ſtill not dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to truſt the emotions ſhe felt, and almoſt ſinking beneath
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:029378_0072_0FE07F81C99BF600"/>
them. Her ſurpriſe would have been leſs had ſhe overheard, on the preceding evening, what Madame Cheron had not forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten—that Valancourt was the nephew of Madame Clairval.</p>
                     <p>What were the particulars of her aunt's note, Emily did not learn, but the reſult was a viſit from Valancourt in the evening, whom Madame Cheron received alone, and they had a long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation before Emily was called down. When ſhe entered the room, her aunt was converſing with complacency, and ſhe ſaw the eyes of Valancourt, as he impatiently roſe, animated with hope.</p>
                     <p>"We have been talking over this affair," ſaid Madame Cheron, "the chevalier has been telling me, that the late Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Clairval was the brother of the Counteſs de Duvarney, his mother. I only wiſh he had mentioned his relationſhip to Madame Clairval before, I certainly ſhould have conſidered that circumſtance as a ſufficient introduction to my houſe." Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court bowed, and was going to addreſs Emily, but her aunt prevented him. "I have therefore, conſented, that you ſhall receive his viſits; and, though I will not bind myſelf by any promiſe, or ſay, that I ſhall conſider him as my nephew, yet, I ſhall permit the intercourſe, and ſhall look forward to any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther connection as an event, which may poſſibly take place in a courſe of years, provided the chevalier riſes in his profeſſion or any circumſtance occurs, which may make it prudent for him to take a wife. But Monſ. Valancourt will obſerve, and you too, Emily, that, till that happens, I poſitively forbid any thoughts of marrying."</p>
                     <p>Emily's countenance, during this coarſe ſpeech, varied every inſtant, and, towards its concluſion, her diſtreſs had ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, that ſhe was on the point of leaving the room. Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court, meanwhile, ſcarcely leſs embarraſſed, did not dare to look at her for whom he was thus diſtreſſed; but, when Madame Cheron was ſilent, he ſaid, "Flattering, madam, as your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation is to me—highly as I am honoured by it—I have yet ſo much to fear, that I ſcarcely dare to hope." "Pray, ſir, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain yourſelf," ſaid Madame Cheron; an unexpected requiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which embarraſſed Valancourt again, and almoſt overcame him with confuſion, at circumſtances, on which, had he been on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſpectator of the ſcene, he would have ſmiled.</p>
                     <p>"Till I receive Mademoiſelle St. Aubert's permiſſion to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept your indulgence," ſaid he, falteringly—"till ſhe allows me to hope—"</p>
                     <p>"O! is that all?" interrupted Madame Cheron. "Well, I will take upon me to anſwer for her. But at the ſame time,
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:029378_0072_0FE07F81C99BF600"/>
ſir, give me leave to obſerve to you, that I am her guardian, and that I expect, in every inſtance, that my will is hers."</p>
                     <p>As ſhe ſaid this, ſhe roſe and quitted the room, leaving Emily and Valancourt in a ſtate of mutual embarraſſment; and, when Valancourt's hopes enabled him to overcome his fears, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs her with the zeal and ſincerity ſo natural to him, it was a conſiderable time before ſhe was ſufficiently recovered to hear with diſtinctneſs his ſolicitations and inquiries.</p>
                     <p>The conduct of Madame Cheron in this affair had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely governed by ſelfiſh vanity. Valancourt in his firſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, had with great candour laid open to her the true ſtate of his preſent circumſtances, and his future expectancies, and ſhe, with more prudence than humanity, had abſolutely and abruptly rejected his ſuit. She wiſhed her niece to marry ambitiouſly, not becauſe ſhe deſired to ſee her in poſſeſſion of the happineſs, which rank and wealth are uſually believed to beſtow, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe deſired to partake the importance, which ſuch an alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance would give. When, therefore, ſhe diſcovered that Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court was the nephew of a perſon of ſo much conſequence as Madame Clairval, ſhe became anxious for the connection, ſince the proſpect it afforded of future fortune and diſtinction for Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily, promiſed the exaltation ſhe coveted for herſelf. Her calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations concerning fortune in this alliance were guided rather by her wiſhes, than by any hint of Valancourt, or ſtrong appearance of probability; and when, ſhe reſted her expectation on the wealth of Madame Clairval, ſhe ſeeemd totally to have forgotten, that the latter had a daughter. Valancourt, however, had not forgotten this circumſtance, and the conſideration of it had made him ſo modeſt in his expectations from Madame Clairval, that he had not even named the relationſhip in his firſt converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Madame Cheron. But whatever might be the future for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of Emily, the preſent diſtinction, which the connection would afford for herſelf, was certain, ſince the ſplendour of Madame Clairval's eſtabliſhment was ſuch as to excite the general envy and partial imitation of the neighbourhood. Thus had ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to involve her niece in an engagement, to which ſhe ſaw only a diſtant and uncertain concluſion, with as little conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her happineſs, as when ſhe had ſo precipitately forbade it: for though ſhe herſelf poſſeſſed the means of rendering this union not only certain, but prudent, yet to do ſo was no part of her preſent intention.</p>
                     <p>From this period Valancourt made frequent viſits to Madame Cheron, and Emily paſſed in his ſociety the happieſt hours ſhe
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:029378_0073_0FE07F866095A108"/>
had known ſince the death of her father. They were both too much engaged by the preſent moments to give ſerious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the future. They loved, and were beloved, and ſaw not, that the very attachment, which formed the delight of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent days, might poſſibly occaſion the ſufferings of years. Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while, Madame Cheron's intercourſe with Madame Clairval be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more frequent than before, and her vanity was already grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ified by the opportunity of proclaiming, wherever ſhe went, the attachment that ſubſiſted between their nephew and niece.</p>
                     <p>Montoni was now alſo become a daily gueſt at the chateau, and Emily was compelled to obſerve, that he really was a ſuitor, and a favoured ſuitor, to her aunt.</p>
                     <p>Thus paſſed the winter months, not only in peace, but in hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, to Valancourt and Emily; the ſtation of his regiment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo near Tholouſe, as to allow this frequent intercourſe. The pavilion on the terrace was the favourite ſcene of their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>views, and there Emily, with Madame Cheron, would work, while Valancourt read aloud works of genius and taſte, liſtened to her enthuſiaſm, expreſſed his own, and caught new opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of obſerving, that their minds were formed to conſtitute the happineſs of each other, the ſame taſte, the ſame noble and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent ſentiments animating each.</p>

                     <p>MADAME Cheron's avarice at length yielded to her vanity. Some very ſplendid entertainments, which Madame Clairval had given, and the general adulation, which was paid her, made the former more anxious than before to ſecure an alliance; that would ſo much exalt her in her own opinion and in that of the world. She propoſed terms for the immediate marriage of her
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:029378_0073_0FE07F866095A108"/>
niece, and offered to give Emily a dower, provided Madame Clairval obſerved equal terms on the part of her nephew. Madame Clairval liſtened to the propoſal, and, conſidering that Emily was the apparent heireſs of her aunt's wealth, accepted it. Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while, Emily knew nothing of the tranſaction, till Madame Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron informed her, that ſhe muſt make preparation for the nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials, which would be celebrated without further delay; then, aſtoniſhed and wholly unable to account for this ſudden conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which Valancourt had not ſolicited (for he was ignorant of what had paſſed between the elder ladies, and had not dared to hope ſuch good fortune) ſhe deciſively objected to it. Madame Cheron, however, quite as jealous of contradiction now, as ſhe had been formerly, contended for a ſpeedy marriage with as much vehemence as ſhe had formerly oppoſed whatever had the moſt remote poſſibility of leading to it; and Emily's ſcruples diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, when ſhe again ſaw Valancourt, who was now informed of the happineſs, deſigned for him, and came to claim a promiſe of it from herſelf.</p>
                     <p>While preparations were making for theſe nuptials, Montoni became the acknowledged lover of Madame Cheron; and, though Madame Clairval was much diſpleaſed, when ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> of the approaching connection, and was willing to prevent that of Valancourt with Emily, her conſcience told her, that ſhe had no right thus to trifle with their peace, and Madame Clairval, though a woman of faſhion, was far leſs advanced than her friend in the art of deriving ſatisfaction from diſtinction and admiration, rather than from conſcience.</p>
                     <p>Emily obſerved with concern the aſcendancy, which Monto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni had acquired over Madame Cheron, as well as the increaſing frequency of his viſits; and her own opinion of this Italian was confirmed by that of Valancourt, who had always expreſſed a diſlike of him. As ſhe was, one morning, ſitting at work in the pavilion, enjoying the pleaſant freſhneſs of ſpring, whoſe col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours were now ſpread upon the landſcape, and liſtening to Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancourt, who was reading, but who often laid aſide the book to converſe, ſhe received a ſummons to attend Madame Cheron immediately, and had ſcarcely entered the dreſſing-room, when ſhe obſerved, with ſurpriſe, the dejection of her aunt's counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and the contraſted gaiety of her dreſs. "So, niece!"—ſaid Madame, and ſhe ſtopped under ſome degree of embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.—"I ſent for you,—I—I wiſhed to ſee you; I have news to tell you. From this hour you muſt conſider the ſignor Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni as your uncle—we were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Aſtoniſhed—not ſo much at the marriage, as at the ſecrecy with which it had been concluded, and the agitation with which it was announced, Emily, at length, attributed the privacy to the wiſh of Montoni, rather than of her aunt. His wife, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, intended, that the contrary ſhould be believed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore added, "You ſee I wiſhed to avoid a buſtle; but now the ceremony is over I ſhall do ſo no longer; and I wiſh to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce to my ſervants, that they muſt receive the ſignor Monto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni for their maſter." Emily made a feeble attempt to congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late her on theſe apparently imprudent nuptials. "I ſhall now celebrate my marriage with ſome ſplendour," continued Madame Montoni, "and to ſave time I ſhall avail myſelf of the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that has been made for yours, which will, of courſe, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed a little while. Such of your wedding clothes as are ready I ſhall expect you will appear in, to do honour to this feſtival. I alſo wiſh you to inform Monſieur Valancourt, that I have changed my name, and he will acquaint Madame Clairv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l. In a few days I ſhall give a grand entertainment, at which I ſhall requeſt their preſence."</p>
                     <p>Emily was ſo loſt in ſurpriſe and various thought, that ſhe made Madame Montoni ſcarcely any reply, but, at her deſire, ſhe returned to inform Valancourt of what had paſſed. Surpriſe was not his predominant emotion on hearing of theſe haſty nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials; and, when he learned, that they were to be the means of delaying his own, and that the very ornaments of the chateau, which had been prepared to grace the nuptial day of his Emily, were to be degraded to the celebration of Madame Montoni's, grief and indignation agitated him alternately. He could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal neither from the obſervation of Emily, whoſe efforts to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract him from theſe ſerious emotions, and to laugh at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive conſiderations, that aſſailed him, were ineffectual; and, when, at length, he took leave, there was an earneſt tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his manner, that extremely affected her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe even ſhed tears, when he diſappeared at the end of the terrace, yet knew not exactly why ſhe ſhould do ſo.</p>
                     <p>Montoni now took poſſeſſion of the chateau and the command of its inhabitants, with the eaſe of a man, who had long conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered it to be his own. His friend Cavigni, who had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſerviceable, in having paid Madame Cheron the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and flattery, which ſhe required, but from which Montoni too often revolted, had apartments aſſigned him, and received from the domeſtics an equal degree of obedience with the maſter of the manſion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="147" facs="unknown:029378_0074_0FE07F94182AF360"/>
Within a few days, Madame Montoni, as ſhe had promiſed, gave a magnificent entertainment to a very numerous company, among whom was Valancourt; but at which Madame Clairval excuſed herſelf from attending. There was a concert, ball and ſupper. Valancourt was, of courſe, Emily's partner, and though, when he gave a look to the decorations of the apartments, he could not but remember, that they were deſigned for other feſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivities, than thoſe they now contributed to celebrate, he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to check his concern by conſidering, that a little while only would elapſe before they would be given to their original deſtination. During this evening, Madame Montoni danced, laughed and talked inceſſantly; while Montoni, ſilent, reſerved and ſomewhat haughty, ſeemed weary of the parade, and of the frivolous company it had drawn together.</p>
                     <p>This was the firſt and the laſt entertainment, given in celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their nuptials. Montoni, though the ſeverity of his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and the gloomineſs of his pride prevented him from enjoying ſuch feſtivities, was extremely willing to promote them. It was ſeldom, that he could meet in any company a man of more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, and ſtill ſeldomer one of more underſtanding, that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the balance of advantage in ſuch parties, or in the connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which might ariſe from them, m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſe of any other competitor for diſtinction and plunder. But his wife, who, when her own intereſt was immediately concerned, had ſometimes more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment than vanity, acquired a conſciouſneſs of her inferiority to other women, in perſonal attractions, which, uniting with the jealouſy natural to the diſcovery, counteracted his readineſs for mingling with all the parties Tholouſe could afford. Till ſhe had, as ſhe ſuppoſed, the affections of an huſband to loſe, ſhe had no motive for diſcovering the unwelcome truth, and it had nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er obtruded itſelf upon her; but, now that it influenced her policy, ſhe oppoſed her huſband's inclination for company, with the more eagerneſs, becauſe ſhe believed him to be really as well received in the female ſociety of the place, as, during his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to her, he had affected to be.</p>
                     <p>A few weeks only had elapſed, ſince the marriage, when Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ame Montoni informed Emily, that the ſignor intented to return to Italy, as ſoon as the neceſſary preparation could be made for ſo long a journey. "We ſhall go to Venice," ſaid ſhe, "where the ſignor has a fine manſion, and from thence to his eſtate in
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:029378_0075_0FE07F98AD8726C0"/>
Tuſcany. Why do you look ſo grave, child?—You are ſo fond of a romantic country and fine views, will doubtleſs be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with this journey." "Am I then to be of the party, madam?" ſaid Emily, with extreme ſurpriſe and emotion.—"Moſt certainly," replied her aunt, "how could you imagine we ſhould leave you behind? But I ſee you are thinking of the Chevalier; he is not yet, I believe informed of the journey, but he very ſoon will be ſo. Signor Montoni is gone to acquaint Madame Clairval of our journey, and to ſay, that the propoſed connection between the families muſt from this time be thought of no more."</p>
                     <p>The unfeeling manner, in which Madame Montoni thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed her niece, that ſhe muſt be ſeparated, perhaps for ever, from the man, with whom ſhe was on the point of being united for life, added to the diſmay, which ſhe muſt otherwiſe have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered at ſuch intelligence. When ſhe could ſpeak ſhe aſked the cauſe of the ſudden change in Madame's ſentiments towards Valancourt, but the only reply ſhe could obtain was, that the Signor had forbade the connection, conſidering it to be greatly inferior to what Emily might reaſonably expect.</p>
                     <p>"I now leave the affair intirely to the Signor," added Madame Montoni, "but I muſt ſay, that M. Valancourt never was a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite with me, and I was overperſuaded, or I ſhould not have given my conſent to the connection. I was weak enough—I am ſo fooliſh ſometimes!—to ſuffer other people's uneaſineſs to affect me, and ſo my better judgment yielded to your affliction. But the Signor has very properly pointed out the folly of this, and he ſhall not have to reprove me a ſecond time. I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, that you ſhall ſubmit to thoſe, who know how to guide you better than yourſelf—I am determined that you ſhall be conformable."</p>
                     <p>Emily would have been aſtoniſhed at the aſſertions of this el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oquent ſpeech, had not her mind been ſo overwhelmed by the ſudden ſhock it had received, that ſhe ſcarcely heard a word of what was latterly addreſſed to her. Whatever were the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of Madame Montoni, ſhe might have avoided to accuſe herſelf with thoſe of compaſſion and tenderneſs to the feelings of others, and eſpecially to thoſe of Emily. It was the ſame ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that lately prevailed upon her to ſolicit an alliance with Madame Clairval's family, which induced her to withdraw from it, now that her marriage with Montoni had exalted her ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, and with it, her views for her niece.</p>
                     <p>Emily was, at this time, too much affected to employ either remonſtrance, or entreaty on this topic; and when, at length,

                        </gap> attempted the latter, her emotion overcame her ſpeech, and ſhe retired to her apartment, to think, if in the preſent ſtate of her mind to think was poſſible, upon this ſudden and overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubject. It was very long before her ſpirits were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently compoſed to permit the reflection, which, when it came, was dark and even terrible. She ſaw that Montoni ſought to aggrandize himſelf in his diſpoſal of her, and it occured, that his friend Cavigni was the perſon, for whom he was intereſted.—The proſpect of going to Italy was ſtill rendered darker, when ſhe conſidered the tumultuous ſituation of that country, then torn by civil commotion, where every petty ſtate was at war with its neighbour, and even every caſtle liable to the attack of an inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. She conſidered the perſon, to whoſe immediate guidance ſhe would be committed, and the vaſt diſtance that was to ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arate her from Valancourt, and, at the recollection of him, every other image vaniſhed from her mind, and every thought was again obſcured by grief.</p>
                     <p>In this perturbed ſtate ſhe paſſed ſome hours, and, when ſhe was ſummoned to dinner, ſhe entreated permiſſion to remain in her own apartment; but Madame Montoni was alone, and the requeſt was refuſed. Emily and her aunt ſaid little during the repaſt; the one occupied by her griefs, the other engroſſed by the diſappointment, which the unexpected abſence of Montoni occaſioned; for not only was her vanity piqued by the neglect, but her jealouſy alarmed by what ſhe conſidered as a myſterious engagement. When the cloth was drawn and they were alone, Emily renewed the mention of Valancourt; but her aunt, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſoftened to pity, or awakened to remorſe, became enraged, that her will ſhould be oppoſed, and the authority of Montoni queſtioned, though this was done by Emily with her uſual gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who, after a long, and torturing converſation, retired in tears.</p>

                     <p>"Emily, O! my Emily!" cried he in a tone faltering with impatience, while ſhe turned, and, as he advanced, was alarmed at the expreſſion of his countenance and the eager deſperation of his air. "<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

and ſaid, with a languid ſmile. "I am better already; If you wiſh to ſee my aunt ſhe is in the dining-parlour." "I muſt ſpeak with <hi>you,</hi> my Emily," replied Valancourt, "Good God! is it already come to this? Are you indeed ſo willing to reſign me? But this is an improper place—I am overheard.

                     <p>Emily, terrified for the conſequence of the indignation, that flaſhed in his eyes, tremblingly aſſured him that Montoni was not at home, and intreated he would endeavour to moderate his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment.

                     <p>Emily no longer oppoſed him, as he led her into an adjoining parlour; the manner, in which he had named Montoni, had ſo much alarmed her for his own ſafety, that ſhe was now only anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious to prevent the conſequences of his juſt reſentment. He liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to her entreaties, with attention, but replied to them only with looks of deſpondency and tenderneſs, concealing, as much as poſſible, the ſentiments he felt toward Montoni, that he might ſooth the apprehenſions, which diſtreſſed her. But ſhe ſaw <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

She threw a glance of ſharp reproof upon her niece, who immediately with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, and of haughty diſpleaſure upon Valancourt</p>
                     <p>"This is not the conduct I ſhould have expected from you, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>uch leſs, that you would ſeek a clandeſtine interview with my niece, and that ſhe would grant one."</p>
                     <p>Valancourt, perceiving it neceſſary to vindicate Emily from ſuch a deſign, explained, that the purpoſe of his own viſit had been to requeſt an interview with Montoni, and he then entered upon the ſubject of it, with the tempered ſpirit, which the ſex, rather than the reſpectability, of Madame Montoni, demanded.</p>
                     <p>His expoſtulations were anſwered with ſevere rebuke; ſhe lamented again, that her prudence had ever yielded to what ſhe termed compaſſion, and added, that ſhe was ſo ſenſible of the folly of her former conſent, that, to prevent the poſſibility of a repetition ſhe had committed the affair intirely to the conduct of Signor Montoni.</p>
                     <p>The feeling eloquence of Valancourt, however, at length, made her ſenſible in ſome meaſure of her unworthy conduct, and ſhe became ſuſceptible to ſhame, but not to remorſe: ſhe hated Valancourt, who awakened her to this painful ſenſation, and, in proportion as ſhe grew diſſatisfied with herſelf, her abhorrance of him increaſed. This was alſo the more inveterate, becauſe his tempered words and manner were ſuch as, without accuſing her, compelled her to accuſe herſelf, and neither left her a hope, that the odious portrait was the caricature of his prejudice, or afforded her an excuſe for expreſſing the violent reſentment, with which ſhe contemplated it. At length, her anger roſe to ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="152" facs="unknown:029378_0077_0FE07FABB7C25290"/>
abruptly left he ſhould forfeit his own eſteem by an intemperate reply. He was then convinced, that from Madame Montoni, he had nothing to hope, for what of either pity, or juſtice could be expected from a perſon, who could feel the pain of guilt, without the humility of repentance.</p>
                     <p>To Montoni he looked with equal deſpondency, ſince it was nearly evident, that this plan of ſeparation originated with him, and it was not probable, that he would relinquiſh his own view<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to entreaties, or remonſtrances, which he muſt have foreſeen and have been prepared to reſiſt. Yet, remembering his promiſe to Emily, and more ſolicitous, concerning his love, than jealous of his conſequence, Valancourt was careful to do nothing that might unneceſſarily irritate Montoni; he wrote to him, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, not to demand an interview, but to ſolicit one, and, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done this, he endeavoured to await with calmneſs his reply.</p>
                     <p>Madame Clairval was paſſive in the affair. When ſhe gave her approbation to Valancourt's marriage, it was in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that Emily would be the heireſs of Madame Montoni's for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; and, though, upon the nuptials of the latter, when ſhe perceived the fallacy of this expectation, her conſcience had withheld her from adopting any meaſure to prevent the union, her benevolence was not ſufficiently active to impel her towards any ſtep, that might now promote it. She was on the contrary, ſecretly pleaſed, that Valancourt was releaſed from an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which ſhe conſidered to be as inferior, in point of fortune, to his merit, as his alliance was thought by Montoni to be hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliating to the beauty of Emily; and, though her pride was wounded by this rejection of a member of her family, ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to ſhew reſentment otherwiſe, than by ſilence.</p>
                     <p>Montoni, in his reply <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Valancourt, ſaid, that as an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view could neither remove the objections of the one, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the wiſhes of the other, it would ſerve only to produce uſeleſs altercation between them. He, therefore, thought proper to refuſe it.</p>
                     <p>In conſideration of the policy, ſuggeſted by Emily, and of his promiſe to her, Valancourt reſtrained the impulſe, that urged him to the houſe of Montoni, to demand what had been den <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Thus ſeveral days paſſed, in remonſtrance, on one ſide, and inflexible denial, on the other; for, whether it was fear, or ſhame, or the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

and was neither ſoftened to pity by the agony, which Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt's letters portrayed, or awakened to a repentance of his own injuſtice by the ſtrong remonſtrances he employed. At length, Valancourt's letters were returned unopened, and then, in the firſt moments of paſſionate deſpair, he forgot every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to Emily, except the ſolemn one, which bound him to avoid violence, and haſtened to Montoni's chateau, determined to ſee him by whatever other means might be neceſſary. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni was denied, and Valancourt, when he afterwards inquired for Madame and Ma'amſelle St. Aubert, was abſolutely refuſed admittance by the ſervants. Not chooſing to ſubmit himſelf to a conteſt with theſe, he, at length, departed, and, returning home in a ſtate of mind approaching to frenzy, wrote to Emily of what had paſſed, expreſſed without reſtraint all the agony of his heart, and entreated, that, ſince he muſt not otherwiſe hope to ſee her immediately, ſhe would allow him an interview un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to Montoni. Soon after he had diſpatched this, his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions becoming more temperate, he was ſenſible of the error he had committed in having given Emily new ſubject of diſtreſs in the ſtrong mention of his own ſuffering, and would have given half the world, had it been his, to recover the letter. Emily, however, was ſpared the pain ſhe muſt have received from it by the ſuſpicious policy of Madame Montoni, who had ordered, that all letters, addreſſed to her niece, ſhould be delivered to herſelf, and who, after having purſued this and indulged the expreſſions of reſentment, which Valancourt's mention of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni provoked, had conſigned it to the flames.</p>
                     <p>Montoni, meanwhile every day more impatient to leave France, gave repeated orders for diſpatch to the ſervants employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in preparations for the journey, and to the perſons, with whom he was tranſacting ſome particular buſineſs. He preſerved a ſteady ſilence to the letters in which Valancourt, deſpairing of greater good, and having ſubdued the paſſion, that had tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed againſt his policy, ſolicited only the indulgence of being allowed to bid Emily farewell. But, when the latter learned, that ſhe was really to ſet out in a very few days, and that it was deſigned he ſhould ſee her no more, forgetting every conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of prudence, he dared, in a ſecond letter to Emily, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a clandeſtine marriage. This alſo was tranſmitted to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame Montoni, and the laſt day of Emily's ſtay at Tholouſe, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, without affording Valancourt even a line to ſooth his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, or a hope, that he ſhould be allowed a parting inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view.</p>

During this period of torturing ſuſpenſe to Valancourt, Emily was ſunk into that kind of ſtupor, with which ſudden and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediable misfortune ſometimes overwhelms the mind. Loving him with the tendereſt affection, and having long been accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to conſider him as the friend and companion of all her future days, ſhe had no ideas of happineſs, that were not connected with him. What, then, muſt have been her ſuffering, when thus ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly they were to be ſeparated, perhaps, for ever, certainly to be thrown into diſtant parts of the world, where they could ſcare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hear of each other's exiſtence; and all this in obedience to the will of a ſtranger, for ſuch was Montoni, and of a perſon who had but lately been anxious to haſten their nuptials! It was in vain, that ſhe endeavoured to ſubdue her grief, and reſign herſelf to an event, which ſhe could not avoid. The ſilence of Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court afflicted more than it ſurpriſed her, ſince ſhe attributed it to its juſt occaſion; but, when the day, preceding that, on which ſhe was to quit Tholouſe, arrived, and ſhe heard no mention of his being permitted to take leave of her, grief overcame every conſideration, that had made her reluctant to ſpeak of him, and ſhe inquired of Madame Montoni, whether this conſolation had been refuſed. Her aunt informed her that it had, adding, that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after the provocation ſhe had herſelf received from Valancourt, in the laſt interview, and the perſecution, which the Signor had ſuffered from his letters, no entreaties ſhould avail to procure it.</p>

She could not, diveſt herſelf of a belief, that ſhe had parted with Valancourt to meet no more; a belief, which did not ariſe merely from foreſeen circumſtances, for, tho' the length of the journey ſhe was about to commence, the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty as to the period of her return, together with the prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhe had received, ſeemed to juſtify it, ſhe yielded alſo to an impreſſion, which ſhe miſtook for a pre-ſentiment, that ſhe was going from Valancourt for ever. How dreadful to her imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, too, was the diſtance that would ſeparate them—the Alps, thoſe tremendous barriers! would riſe, and whole countries ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend between the regions where each muſt exiſt! To live in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining provinces, to live even in the ſame country, though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeing him, was comparative happineſs to the conviction of this dreadful length of diſtance.</p>
                     <p>Her mind was at length ſo much agitated by the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her ſtate, and the belief, that ſhe had ſeen Valancourt for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> of the hour awakened. But, perceiving nothing that could juſtify it, ſhe aſcended to the terrace, where the moonlight
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:029378_0079_0FE07FBDCF6FCC28"/>
ſhewed the long broad walk, with the pavilion, at its extremity, while the rays ſilvered the foliage of the high trees and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, that bordered it on the right, and the tufted ſummits of thoſe, that roſe to a level with the baluſtrade on the left, from the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den below. Her diſtance from the chateau again alarming her, ſhe pauſed to liſten; the night was ſo calm, that no ſound could have eſcaped her, but ſhe heard only the plaintive ſweetneſs of the nightingale, with the light ſhiver of the leaves, and ſhe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued her way towards the pavilion, having reached which, its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity did not prevent the emotion, that a fuller view of its well known ſcene would have excited. The lattices were thrown back, and ſhewed beyond their embowered arch the moonlight landſcape, ſhadowy and ſoft; its groves, and plains extending gradually and indiſtinctly to the eye, its diſtant mountains catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſtronger gleam, and the nearer river reflecting the moon, and trembling to her rays.</p>
                     <p>Emily, as ſhe approached the lattice, was ſenſible of the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of this ſcene only as they ſerved to bring Valancourt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> immediately to her fancy. "Ah!" ſaid ſhe with a heavy ſigh, as ſhe threw herſelf into a chair by the window, "how often have we ſat together in this ſpot—often have looked upon that landſcape! Never, never more ſhall we view it together—never, never more, perhaps, ſhall we look upon each other!"</p>
                     <p>Her tears were ſuddenly ſtopped by terror—a voice ſpoke near her in the pavilion; ſhe ſhrieked—it ſpoke again, and ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed the well known tones of Valancourt. It was indeed Valancourt who ſupported her in his arms! for ſome moments their emotion would not ſuffer either to ſpeak. "Emily!" ſaid Valancourt at length, as he preſſed her hand in his, "Emily!" and he was again ſilent, but the accent, in which he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced her name, expreſſed all his tenderneſs and ſorrow.</p>
                     <p>"O my Emily!" he reſumed, after a long pauſe, "I do then ſee you once again, and hear again the ſound of that voice! I have haunted this place—theſe gardens, for, many—many nights, with a faint, very faint hope of ſeeing you. This was the only chance that remained for me, and, thank heaven! it has at length ſucceeded—I am not condemned to abſolute deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair!"</p>
                     <p>Emily ſaid ſomething, ſhe ſcarcely knew what, expreſſive of her unalterable affection, and endeavoured to calm the agitation of his mind; but Valancourt could for ſometime only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="157" facs="unknown:029378_0079_0FE07FBDCF6FCC28"/>
and have been watching in the gardens, and in this pavilion ever ſince; for, though I had now given up all hope of ſeeing you, I could not reſolve to tear myſelf from a place ſo near to you, and ſhould probably have lingered about the chateau till morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dawned. O how heavenly the moments have paſſed, yet with what various emotion have they been marked, as I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thought I heard footſteps, and fancied you were approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and then again—perceived only a dead and dreary ſilence! But, when you opened the door of the pavilion, and the darkneſs prevented my diſtinguiſhing with certainty, whether it was my love—my heart beat ſo ſtrongly with hopes and fears, that I could not ſpeak. The inſtant I heard the plaintive accents of your voice, my doubts vaniſhed, but not my fears, till you ſpoke of me; then, loſing the apprehenſion of alarming you in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> of my emotion, I could no longer be ſilent. O Emily! theſe are moments, in which joy and grief ſtruggle ſo powerfully for pre-eminence, that the heart can ſcarcely ſupport the conteſt!"</p>
                     <p>Emily's heart acknowledged the truth of this aſſertion, but the joy ſhe felt on thus meeting Valancourt, at the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when ſhe was lamenting, that they muſt probably meet no more, ſoon melted into grief, as reflection ſtole over her thoughts, and imagination prompted viſions of the future. She ſtruggled to recover the calm dignity of mind, which was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſupport her through this laſt interview, and which Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancourt found it utterly impoſſible to attain, for the tranſports of his joy changed abruptly into thoſe of ſuffering, and he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the moſt impaſſioned language his horror of this ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and his deſpair of their ever meeting again. Emily wept ſilently as ſhe liſtened to him, and then, trying to command her own diſtreſs, and to ſooth his, ſhe ſuggeſted every circumſtance that could lead to hope. But the energy of his fears led him inſtantly to detect the friendly fallacies, which ſhe endeavoured to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe on herſelf and him, and to conjure up illuſions too powerful for his reaſon.</p>
                     <p>"You are going from me," ſaid he, "to a diſtant country, O how diſtant!—to new ſociety, new friends, new admirers, with people too, who will try to make you forget me, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote new connections! How can I know this, and not know, that you will never return for me—never can be mine." His voice was ſtifled by ſighs.</p>
                     <p>"You believe, then," ſaid Emily, "<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> the pangs I ſuffer proceed from a trivial and temporary intereſt; you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve—"</p>

"Suffer!" interrupted Valancourt, "ſuffer for me! O Emily, how ſweet—how bitter are thoſe words; what comfort, what anguiſh do they give! I ought not to doubt the ſteadineſs of your affection, yet ſuch is the inconſiſtency of real love, that it is always awake to ſuſpicion, however unreaſonable; always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring new aſſurances from the object of its intereſt, and thus it is, that I always feel revived, as by a new conviction, when your words tell me I am dear to you; and wanting theſe, I relapſe into doubt, and too often into deſpondency." Then ſeeming to recollect himſelf, he exclaimed, "But what a wretch am I, thus to torture you, and in theſe moments, too! I, who ought to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and comfort you!"</p>
                     <p>This reflection overcame Valancourt with tenderneſs, but, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſing into deſpondency, he again felt only for himſelf, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented again this cruel ſeparation, in a voice and words ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſioned, that Emily could no longer ſtruggle to repreſs her own grief or to ſooth his. Valancourt, between theſe emotions of love and pity, loſt the power, and almoſt the wiſh, of repreſſing his agitation; and in the intervals of convulſive ſobs, he, at one moment, kiſſed away her tears, then told her cruelly, that poſſibly ſhe might never again weep for him, and then tried to ſpeak more calmly, but only exclaimed, "O Emily—my heart will break!—I cannot—cannot leave you! Now—I gaze upon that countenance, now I hold you in my arms! a little while, and all this will appear a dream. I ſhall look, and cannot ſee you; ſhall try to recollect your features—and the impreſſion will be fled from my imagination; to hear the tones of your voice, and even memory will be ſilent! I cannot, cannot leave you! Why ſhould we confide the happineſs of our whole lives to the will of people, who have no right to interrupt, and, except in giving you to me, have no power to promote it? O Emily! venture to truſt your own heart, venture to be mine forever!" His voice trembled, and he was ſilent; Emily continued to weep, and was ſilent alſo, when Valancourt proceeded to propoſe an immediate marriage, and that, at an early hour on the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing morning, ſhe ſhould quit Madame Montoni's houſe, and be conducted by him to the church of the Auguſtines, where a friar ſhould await to unite them.</p>
                     <p>The ſilence, with which ſhe liſtened to a propoſal, dictated by love and deſpair, and enforced at a moment, when it ſeemed ſcarcely poſſible for her to oppoſe it; when her heart was ſoften<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſorrows of a ſeparation, that might be eternal, and her reaſon obſcured by the illuſions of love and terror, encouraged
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:029378_0080_0FE07FCC5CBF9A98"/>
him to hope, that it would not be rejected. "Speak, my Emily!" <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Valancourt eagerly, "let me hear your voice, let me hear you confirm my fate." She ſpoke not; her cheek was cold, and her ſenſes ſeemed to fail her, but ſhe did not faint. To Valancourt's terrified imagination ſhe appeared to be dying; he called upon her name, roſe to go to the chateau for aſſiſtance, and then, recollecting her ſituation, feared to go, or to leave her for a moment.</p>
                     <p>After a few minutes, ſhe drew a deep ſigh, and began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive. The conflict ſhe had ſuffered, between love and the duty ſhe at preſent owed to her father's ſiſter; her repugnance to a clandeſtine marriage, her fear of emerging on the world with embarraſſments, ſuch as might ultimately involve the object of her affection in miſery and repentance; all this various intereſt was too powerful for a mind, already enervated by ſorrow, and her reaſon had ſuffered a tranſient ſuſpenſion. But duty, and good ſenſe, however hard the conflict, at length, triumphed over affection and mournful preſentiment; above all, ſhe dreaded to involve Valancourt in obſcurity and vain regret, which ſhe ſaw, or thought ſhe ſaw, muſt be the too certain conſequence of a marriage in their preſent circumſtances; and ſhe acted, perhaps, with ſomewhat more than female fortitude, when ſhe reſolved to endure a preſent, rather than provoke a diſtant misfortune.</p>
                     <p>With a candour, that proved how truly ſhe eſteemed and lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and which endeared her to him, if poſſible more than ever, ſhe told Valancourt all her reaſons for rejecting his propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals. Thoſe, which influenced her concerning his future wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, he inſtantly refuted, or rather contradicted; but they awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened tender conſiderations for her, which the frenzy of paſſion and deſpair had concealed before, and love, which had but lately prompted him to propoſe a clandeſtine and immediate marriage, now induced him to renounce it. The triumph was almoſt too much for his heart; for Emily's ſake, he endeavoured to ſtifle his grief, but the ſwelling anguiſh would not be reſtrained.—"O Emily!" ſaid he, "I muſt leave you—I <hi>muſt</hi> leave you, and I know it is for ever."</p>
                     <p>Convulſive ſobs again interrupted his words, and they wept together in ſilence, till Emily, recollecting the danger of being diſcovered, and the impropriety of prolonging an interview, which might ſubject her to cenſure, ſummoned all her fortitude to utter a laſt farewel.</p>
                     <p>"Stay!" ſaid Valancourt, "I conjure you ſtay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for I have much to tell you. The agitation of my mind has hitherto ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:029378_0081_0FE07FD144517FD0"/>

                     <p>Emily, much agitated did not leave Valancourt, but ſhe led him from the pavilion, and, as they walked upon the terrace, he proceeded as follows:</p>
                     <p>"This Montoni: I have heard ſome ſtrange hints concerning him. Are you certain he is of Madame Queſnel's family, and that his fortune is what it appears to be?"</p>
                     <p>"I have no reaſon to doubt either," replied Emily, in a voice of alarm. "Of the firſt, indeed, I cannot doubt, but I have no certain means of judging of the latter, and I entreat you will tell me all you have heard."</p>
                     <p>"That I certainly will, but it is very imperfect, and unſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory information. I gathered it by an accident from an Ital<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian, who was ſpeaking to another perſon of this Montoni. They were talking of his marriage; the Italian ſaid, that if he was the perſon he meant, he was not likely to make Madame Cheron happy. He proceeded to ſpeak of him in general terms of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and then gave ſome particular hints, concerning his char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter, that excited my curioſity, and I ventured to aſk him a few queſtions. He was reſerved in his replies, but after heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for ſome time, he owned, that he had underſtood abroad, that Montoni was a man of deſperate fortune and character.—He ſaid ſomething of a caſtle of Montoni's, ſituated among the Apennines, and of ſome ſtrange circumſtances, that might be mentioned, as to his former mode of life. I preſſed him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form me further, but I believe the ſtrong intereſt I felt was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in my manner, and alarmed him; for no entreaties could prevail with him to give any explanation of the circumſtances he had alluded to, or to mention any thing further concerning Montoni. I obſerved to him, that, if Montoni was poſſeſſed of a caſtle in the Apennines, it appeared from ſuch a circumſtance, that he was of ſome family, and alſo ſeemed to contradict the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that he was a man of entirely broken fortunes.

                     <p>"A hope of learning ſomething more ſatisfactory, or more poſitive, detained me in his company a conſiderable time, and I renewed the ſubject repeatedly, but the Italian wrapped himſelf up in reſerve, ſaid—that what he had mentioned he had caught only from a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

from perſonal malice, and were very little to be depended upon. I forbore to preſs the ſubject farther, ſince it was obvious that he was alarmed for the conſequence of what he had already ſaid, and I was compelled to remain in uncertainty on a point where ſuſpenſe is almoſt intolerable. Think, Emily, what I muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to ſee you depart for a foreign country, committed to the power of a man of ſuch doubtful character as is this Montoni! But I will not alarm you unneceſſarily; it is poſſible, as the Ital<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian ſaid, at firſt, that this is not the Montoni he alluded to.—Yet, Emily, conſider well before you reſolve to commit yourſelf to him. O! I muſt not truſt myſelf to ſpeak—or I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all the motives, which ſo lately influenced me to reſign the hope of your becoming mine immediately,"</p>
                     <p>Valancourt walked upon the terrace with hurried ſteps, while Emily remained leaning on the baluſtrade in deep thought.—The information ſhe had juſt received excited perhaps, more alarm than it could juſtify, and raiſed once more the conflict of contraſted intereſts. She had never liked Montoni. The fire and keenneſs of his eye, its proud exultation, its bold fierceneſs, its ſullen watchfulneſs, as occaſion, and even ſlight occaſion, had called forth the latent ſoul, ſhe had often obſerved with emotion; while from the uſual expreſſion of his countenance ſhe had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſhrunk. From ſuch obſervations ſhe was the more inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to believe, that it was this Montoni, of whom the Italian had uttered his ſuſpicious hints. The thought of being ſolely in his power, in a foreign land, was terrifying to her, but it was not by terror alone that ſhe was urged to an immediate marriage with Valancourt. The tendereſt love had already pleaded his cauſe, but had been unable to overcome her opinion, as to her duty, her diſintereſted conſiderations for Valancourt, and the delicacy, which made her revolt from a clandeſtine union. It was not to be expected, that a vague terror would be more powerful, than the united influence of love and grief. But it recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all their energy, and rendered a ſecond conqueſt neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>With Valancourt, whoſe imagination was now awake to the ſuggeſtion of every paſſion; whoſe apprehenſions for Emily had acquired ſtrength by the mere mention of them, and became every inſtant more powerful, as his mind brooded over them—with Valancourt no ſecond conqueſt was attainable. He thought he ſaw in the cleareſt light, and love aſſiſted the fear, that this journey to Italy would involve Emily in miſery; he determined, therefore to perſevere in oppoſing it, and in conjuring her to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon him the title of her lawful protector.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="162" facs="unknown:029378_0082_0FE07FDF581B3808"/>
"Emily!" ſaid he, with ſolemn earneſtneſs, "this is no time for ſcrupulous diſtinctions, for weighing the dubious and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively trifling circumſtances that may affect our future com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. I now ſee, much more clearly than before, the train of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious dangers, you are going to encounter with a man of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni's character. Thoſe dark hints of the Italian ſpoke much, but not more than the idea I have of Montoni's diſpoſition, as exhibited even in his countenance. I think I ſee at this moment all that could have been hinted, written there. He is the Ital<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian, whom I fear, and I conjure you for your own ſake, as well as for mine, to prevent the evils I ſhudder to foreſee. O Emily! let my tenderneſs, my arms withhold you from them—give me the right to defend you!"</p>
                     <p>Emily only ſighed, while Valancourt proceeded to remonſtrate and to entreat with all the energy that love and apprehenſion could inſpire. But, as his imagination magnified to her the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible evils ſhe was going to meet, the miſts of her own fancy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to diſſipate, and allowed her to diſtinguiſh the exaggerated images, which impoſed on his reaſon. She conſidered, that there was no proof of Montoni being the perſon, whom the ſtranger had meant; that, even if he was ſo, the Italian had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed his character and broken fortunes merely from report; and that, though the countenance of Montoni ſeemed to give proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to a part of the rumour, it was not by ſuch circumſtances that an implicit belief of it could be juſtified. Theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would probably not have ariſen ſo diſtinctly to her mind at this time, had not the terrors of Valancourt preſented to her ſuch obvious exaggerations of her danger, as incited her to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt the fallacies of paſſion. But while ſhe endeavoured in the gentleſt manner to convince him of his error, ſhe plunged him into a new one. His voice and countenance changed to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of dark deſpair. "Emily!" ſaid he, "this, this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the bittereſt that is yet come to me. You do not—can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not love me!—It would be impoſſible for you to reaſon thus cooly, thus deliberately, if you did. I, <hi>I</hi> am torn with anguiſh at the proſpect of our ſeparation, and of the evils that may await you in conſequence of it; I would encounter any hazards to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it—to ſave you. No! Emily, no!—you cannot love me."</p>
                     <p>"We have now little time to waſte in exclamation, or aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion," ſaid Emily, endeavouring to conceal her emotion: "if you are yet to learn how dear you are, and ever muſt be, to my heart, no aſſurances of mine can give you conviction."</p>
                     <p>The laſt words faltered on her lips, and her tears flowed faſt, Thoſe words and tears brought, once more, and with inſtantane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

force, conviction of her love to Valancourt. He could only exclaim, "Emily! Emily!" and weep over the hand he preſſed to his lips; but ſhe, after ſome moments, again rouſed herſelf from the indulgence of ſorrow, and ſaid, "I muſt leave you; it is late, and my abſence from the chateau may be diſcovered. Think of me—love me—when I am far away; the belief of this will be my comfort!"</p>
                     <p>"Think of you!—love you!" exclaimed Valancourt.</p>
                     <p>"Try to moderate theſe tranſports," ſaid Emily, "for my ſake, try."</p>
                     <p>"For your ſake!"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, for my ſake," replied Emily, in a tremulous voice, "I cannot leave you thus!"</p>
                     <p>"Then do not leave me," ſaid Valancourt, with quickneſs. "Why ſhould we part, or part for longer than till to morrow?"</p>
                     <p>"I am, indeed I am, unequal to theſe moments," replied Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, "you tear my heart, but I never can conſent to this haſty, imprudent propoſal!"</p>
                     <p>"If we could command our time, my Emily, it ſhould not be thus haſty; we muſt ſubmit to circumſtances."</p>
                     <p>"We muſt, indeed! I have already told you all my heart—my ſpirits are gone. You allowed the force of my objections, till your tenderneſs called up vague terrors, which have given us both unneceſſary anguiſh. Spare me! do not oblige me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the reaſons I have already urged."</p>
                     <p>"Spare you!" cried Valancourt, "I am a wretch—a very wretch, that have felt only for myſelf!—I! who ought to have ſhewn the fortitude of a man, who ought to have ſupported you, I! have increaſed your ſufferings by the conduct of a child! Forgive me, Emily! think of the diſtraction of my mind now that I am about to part with all that is dear to me—and forgive me! When you are gone, I ſhall recollect with bitter remorſe what I have made you ſuffer, and ſhall wiſh in vain that I could ſee you, if only for a moment that I might ſooth your grief."</p>
                     <p>Tears again interrupted his voice, and Emily wept with him. "I will ſhew myſelf more worthy of your love," ſaid Valancourt, at length; "I will not prolong theſe moments. My Emily—my own Emily! never forget me! God knows when we ſhall meet again! I reſign you to his care.—O God!—O God!—protect and bleſs her!"</p>
                     <p>He preſſed her hand to his heart. Emily ſunk almoſt lifeleſs on his boſom; and neither wept, nor ſpoke. Valancourt, now commanding his own diſtreſs, tried to comfort and re-aſſure her,
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:029378_0083_0FE07FE5114DEA98"/>
but ſhe appeared totally unaffected by what he ſaid, and a ſigh, which ſhe uttered now and then, was all that proved ſhe had not fainted.</p>
                     <p>He ſupported her ſlowly towards the chateau, weeping and ſpeaking to her; but ſhe anſwered only in ſighs, till having reached the gate that terminated the avenue, ſhe ſeemed to have recovered her conſciouſneſs, and, looking round, perceived how near they were to the chateau. "We muſt part here," ſaid ſhe, ſtopping, "Why prolong theſe moments? Teach me the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude I have forgot."</p>
                     <p>Valancourt ſtruggled to aſſume a compoſed air. "Farewel, my love!" ſaid he, in a voice of ſolemn tenderneſs—"truſt me we ſhall meet again, meet for each other, meet to part no more!" His voice faltered, but, recovering it, he proceeded in a firmer tone. "You know not what I ſhall ſuffer, till I hear from you; I ſhall omit no opportunity of conveying to you my letters, yet I tremble to think how few may occur. And truſt me, love, for your dear ſake, I will try to bear this abſence with fortitude. O how little I have ſhewn to night!"</p>
                     <p>"Farewel!" ſaid Emily faintly. "When you are gone, I ſhall think of many things I would have ſaid to you." "And I of many, many!" ſaid Valancourt; "I never left you yet, that I did not immediately remember ſome queſtion, or ſome entreaty, or ſome circumſtance, concerning my love, that I earneſtly wiſhed to mention, and feel wretched becauſe I could not. O Emily <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

O! what an infinite difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this moment and the next! <hi>Now,</hi> I am in your preſence, can behold you! <hi>then,</hi> all will be a dreary blank—and I ſhall be a wanderer, exiled from my only home!"</p>
                     <p>Valancourt again preſſed her to his heart, and held her there in ſilence, weeping. Tears once again calmed her oppreſſed mind. They again bade each other farewel, lingered a moment, and then parted. Valancourt ſeemed to force himſelf from the ſpot; he paſſed haſtily up the avenue, and Emily, as ſhe moved ſlowly towards the chateau, heard his diſtant ſteps. She liſtened to the ſounds, as they ſunk fainter and fainter, till the melancholy ſtillneſs of night alone remained; and then hurried to her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to ſeek repoſe, which, alas! was fled from her wretchedneſs.</p>

                     <p>THE carriages were at the gates at an early hour; the buſtle of the domeſtics, paſſing to and fro in the galleries, awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened Emily from haraſſing ſlumbers: her unquiet mind had, during the night, preſented her with terrific images and obſcure circumſtances, concerning her affection and her future life. She now endeavoured to chaſe away the impreſſions they had left on her fancy; but from imaginary evils ſhe awoke to the conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of real ones. Recollecting that ſhe had parted with Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court, perhaps for ever, her heart ſickened as memory revived. But ſhe tried to diſmiſs the diſmal forebodings that crowded on her mind, and to reſtrain the ſorrow which ſhe could not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due; efforts which diffuſed over the ſettled melancholy of her countenance an expreſſion of tempered reſignation, as a thin veil, thrown over the features of beauty, renders them more intereſting by a partial concealment. But Madame Montoni obſerved nothing in this countenance except its unuſual paleneſs, which attracted her cenſure. She told her niece, that ſhe had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging in fanciful ſorrows, and begged ſhe would have more regard for decorum, than to let the world ſee that ſhe could not renounce an improper attachment; at which Emily's pale cheek became fluſhed with crimſon, but it was the bluſh of pride, and ſhe made no anſwer. Soon after, Montoni entered the breakfaſt room, ſpoke little, and ſeemed impatient to be gone.</p>
                     <p>The windows of this room opened upon the garden. As Emily paſſed them, ſhe ſaw the ſpot where ſhe had parted with Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court on the preceding night: the remembrance preſſed heavily on her heart, and ſhe turned haſtily away from the object that awakened it.</p>
                     <p>The baggage being at length adjuſted, the travellers entered their carriages, and Emily would have left the chateau without one ſigh of regret, had it not been ſituated in the neighbourhood of Valancourt's reſidence.</p>
                     <p>From a little eminence ſhe looked back upon Tholouſe, and the far-ſeen plains of Gaſcony, beyond which the broken ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the Pyrenees appeared on the diſtant horizon, lighted up by a morning ſun. "Dear pleaſant mountains!" ſaid ſhe to herſelf, "how long may it be ere I ſee ye again, and how
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:029378_0084_0FE07FEF31882148"/>
much may happen to make me miſerable in the interval! Oh, could I now be certain, that I ſhould ever return to ye, and find that Valancourt ſtill lived for me, I ſhould go in peace! He will ſtill gaze on ye, gaze when I am far away!"</p>
                     <p>The trees, that impended over the high banks of the road and formed a line of perſpective with the diſtant country, now threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to exclude the view of them; but the blueiſh mountains ſtill appeared beyond the dark foliage, and Emily continued to lean from the coach window, till at length the cloſing branches ſhut them from her ſight.</p>
                     <p>Another object ſoon caught her attention. She had ſcarcely looked at a perſon who walked along the bank, with his hat, in which was the military feather, drawn over his eyes, before, at the ſound of wheels, he ſuddenly turned, and ſhe perceived that it was Valancourt himſelf, who waved his hand, ſprung into the road, and through the window of the carriage put a letter into her hand. He endeavoured to ſmile through the deſpair that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread his countenance as ſhe paſſed on. The remembrance of that ſmile ſeemed impreſſed on Emily's mind for ever. She leaned from the window, and ſaw him on a knoll of the broken bank, lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the high trees that waved over him, and purſuing the carriage with his eyes. He waved his hand, and ſhe continued to gaze till diſtance confuſed his figure, and at length another turn of the road entirely ſeparated him from her ſight.</p>
                     <p>Having ſtopped to take up Signor Cavigni at a chateau on the road, the travellers, of whom Emily was diſrepectfully ſeated with Madame Montoni's woman in a ſecond carriage, purſued their way over the plains of Languedoc. The preſence of this ſervant reſtrained Emily from reading Valancourt's letter, for ſhe did not chooſe to expoſe the emotions it might occaſion, to the obſervation of any perſon. Yet ſuch was her wiſh to read this his laſt communication, that her trembling hand was every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the point of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>eaking the ſeal.</p>
                     <p>At length they reached the village, where they ſtaid only to change horſes, without alighting, and it was not till they ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to dine, that Emily had an opportunity of reading the letter. Though ſhe had never doubted the ſincerity of Valancourt's af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, the freſh aſſurances ſhe now received of it revived her ſpirits; ſhe wept over his letter in tenderneſs, laid it by to be referred to when they ſhould be particularly depreſſed, and then thought of him with much leſs anguiſh than ſhe had done ſince they parted. Among ſome other requeſts, which were intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her, becauſe expreſſive of his tenderneſs, and becauſe a

"You will then meet me in thought," ſaid he; "I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly watch the ſunſet, and I ſhall be happy in the belief, that your eyes are fixed upon the ſame object with mine, and that our minds are converſing. You know not, Emily, the comfort I promiſe myſelf from theſe moments; but I truſt you will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience it."</p>
                     <p>It is unneceſſary to ſay with what emotion Emily, on this evening, watched the declining ſun, over a long extent of plains, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Emily's mind was even ſo much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged with new and wonderful images, that they ſometimes baniſhed the idea of Valancourt, though they more frequently revived it. Theſe brought to her recollection the proſpects among the Pyrenees, which they had admired together, and had believed nothing could excel in grandeur. How often did ſhe wiſh to expreſs to him the new emotions which this aſtoniſhing ſcenery awakened, and that he could partake of them! Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times too ſhe endeavoured to anticipate his remarks, and almoſt imagined him preſent. She ſeemed to have ariſen into another world, and to have left every trifling thought, every trifling ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, in that below; thoſe only of grandeur and ſublimity now dilated her mind, and elevated the affections of her heart.</p>
                     <p>With what emotions of ſublimity, ſoftened by tenderneſs, did ſhe meet Valancourt in thought, at the cuſtomary hour of ſunſet, when, wandering among the Alps, ſhe watched the glorious orb ſink amid their ſummits, his laſt tints die away on their ſnowy points, and a ſolemn obſcurity ſteal over the ſcene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> And when the laſt gleam had faded, ſhe turned her eyes from the weſt with ſomewhat of the melancholy regret that is experienced after the departure of a beloved friend; while theſe lonely feelings were heightened by the ſpreading gloom, and by the low ſounds, heard only when darkneſs confines attention, which make the general ſtillneſs more impreſſive—leaves ſhook by the air, the laſt

                     <p>During the firſt days of this journey among the Alps, the ſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery exhibited a wonderful mixture of ſolitude and inhabitation, of cultivation and barrenneſs. On the edge of tremendous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices, and within the hollow of the cliffs, below which the clouds often floated, were ſeen villages, ſpires, and convent tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; while green paſtures and vineyards ſpread their hues at the feet of perpendicular rocks of marble, or of granite, whoſe points, tufted with alpine ſhrubs, or exhibiting only maſſy crags, roſe above each other, till they terminated in the ſnow-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But who may deſcribe her rapture, when, having paſſed through a ſea of vapour, ſhe caught a firſt view of Italy; when, from the ridge of one of thoſe tremendous precipices that hang upon Mount Cenis and guard the entrance of that enchanting country, ſhe looked down through the lower clouds, and, as they floated away, ſaw the graſſy vales of Piedmont at her feet, and, beyond, the plains of Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy extending to the fartheſt diſtance, at which appeared, on the faint horizon, the doubtful towers of Turin?</p>

The ſubject brought to Emily's imagination the diſaſters he had ſuffered in this bold and perilous adventure.—She ſaw his vaſt armies winding among the defiles, and over the tremendous cliffs of the mountains, which at night were lighted up by his fires, or by the torches which he cauſed to be carried when he purſued his indefatigable march. In the eye of fancy, ſhe perceived the gleam of arms through the duſkineſs of night, the glitter of ſpears and helmets, and the banners floating dimly on the twilight; while <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> and then the blaſt of a diſtant trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet echoed along the deule, and the ſignal was anſwered by a momentary claſh of arms. She looked with horror upon the mountaineers, perched on the higher cliffs, aſſailing the troops below with broken fragments of the mountain; on ſoldiers and elephants tumbling headlong down the lower precipices; and, as ſhe liſtened to the rebounding rocks, that followed their fall, the terrors of fancy yielded to thoſe of reality, and ſhe ſhudder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to behold herſelf on the dizzy height, whence ſhe had pictur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the deſcent of others.</p>
                     <p>Madame Montoni, meantime, as ſhe looked upon Italy, was contemplating in imagination the ſplendour of palaces and the grandeur of caſtles, ſuch as ſhe believed ſhe was going to be miſtreſs of at Venice and in the Apennine, and ſhe became, in idea, little leſs than a princeſs.

This bliſsful reverie was ſomewhat obſcured, when ſhe recollected the Signor, her huſband, who, though he was not averſe to the profit which ſometimes reſults from ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, had always ſhewn a contempt of the frivolous parade that ſometimes attends them; till ſhe conſidered that his pride might be gratified by diſplaying, among his own friends, in his native city, the wealth which he had neglected in France; and ſhe courted again the ſplendid illuſions that had charmed her before.</p>

The travellers, as they deſcended, gradually, exchanged the region of winter for the genial warmth and beauty of ſpring.—The ſky began to aſſume that ſerene and beautiful tint peculiar to the climate of Italy; patches of young verdure, fragrant ſhrubs and flowers looked gaily among the rocks, often fringing their rugged brows, or hanging in tufts from their broken ſides; and the buds of the oak and mountain-aſh were expanding into foliage. Deſcending lower, the orange and the myrtle, every now and then, appeared in ſome ſunny nook, with their yellow bloſſoms peeping from among the dark green of their leaves, and mingling with the ſcarlet flowers of the pomegranate and the paler ones of the arbutus, that ran mantling to the crags above; while, lower ſtill, ſpread the paſtures of Piedmont, where early flocks were cropping the luxuriant herbage of ſpring.</p>
                     <p>The river Doria, which, riſing on the ſummit of Mount Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, had daſhed for many leagues over the precipices that bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the road, now began to aſſume a leſs impetuous, though ſcarcely leſs romantic character, as it approached the green val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of Piedmont, into which the travellers deſcended with the evening ſun; and Emily found herſelf once more amid the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quil beauty of paſtoral ſcenery; among flocks and herds, and ſlopes tufted with woods of lively verdure and with beautiful ſhrubs, ſuch as ſhe had often ſeen waving luxuriantly over the Alps above. The verdure of the paſturage, now varied with the hues of early flowers, among which were yellow ranunculuſes and panſey violets of delicious fragrance, ſhe had never ſeen ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled. Emily almoſt wiſhed to become a peaſant of Piedmont, to inhabit one of the pleaſant embowered cottages which ſhe ſaw peeping beneath the cliffs, and to paſs her careleſs hours among thoſe romantic landſcapes. To the hours, the months, ſhe was to paſs under the dominion of Montoni, ſhe looked with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion; while thoſe which were departed ſhe remembered with regret and ſorrow.</p>
                     <p>In the preſent ſcenes her fancy often gave her the figure of Valancourt, whom ſhe ſaw on a point of the cliffs, gazing with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The travellers, paſſing Novaleſa, reached, after the evening had cloſed, the ſmall and ancient town of Suſa, which had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly guarded this paſs of the Alps into Piedmont. The heights which command it had, ſince the invention of artillery, rendered its fortifications uſeleſs; but theſe romantic heights, ſeen by moonlight, with the town below, ſurrounded by its walls and watch-towers, and partially illumined, exhibited an intereſting picture to Emily. Here they reſted for the night at an inn, which had little accommodation to boaſt of; but the travellers brought with them the hunger that gives delicious fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to the coarſeſt viands, and the wearineſs that enſures repoſe; and here Emily firſt caught a ſtrain of Italian muſic, on Italian ground. As ſhe ſat after ſupper at a little window, that opened upon the country, obſerving an effect of the moonlight on the broken ſurface of the mountains, and remembering that on ſuch a night as this ſhe once had ſat with her father and Valancourt, reſting upon a cliff of the Pyrenees, ſhe heard from below the long-drawn notes of a violin, of ſuch tone and delicacy of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, as harmonized exactly with the tender emotions ſhe was indulging, and both charmed and ſurpriſed her. Cavigni, who approached the window, ſmiled at her ſurpriſe. "This is nothing extraordinary," ſaid he, "you will hear the ſame, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, at every inn in our way. It is one of our landlord's fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily who plays, I doubt not." Emily, as ſhe liſtened, thought he could be ſcarcely leſs than a profeſſor of muſic whom ſhe heard; and the ſweet and plaintive ſtrains ſoon lulled her into a reverie, from which ſhe was very unwillingly rouſed by the raillery of Cavigni, and by the voice of Montoni, who gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to a ſervant to have the carriages ready at an early hour on the following morning; and added, that he meant to dine at Turin.</p>
                     <p>Madame Montoni was exceedingly rejoiced to be once more on level ground; and, after giving a long detail of the various terrors ſhe had ſuffered, which ſhe forgot that ſhe was deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the companions of her dangers, ſhe added a hope, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

"He is going to the

                     <p>Emily agreed with the talkative Annette, that this young man was making a change for the worſe, and could not forbear ſilently lamenting, that he ſhould be drawn from the innocence and beauty of theſe ſcenes, to the corrupt ones of that voluptuous city.</p>

                     <p>EARLY on the following morning the travellers ſet out for Turin. The luxuriant plain, that extends from the feet of the Alps to that magnificent city, was not then, as now, ſhaded by an avenue of trees nine miles in length; but plantations of olives, mulberry and palms, feſtooned with vines, mingled with the paſtoral ſcenery, through which the rapid Po, after its deſcent from the mountains, wandered to meet the humble Doria at Turin. As they advanced towards this city, the Alps, ſeen at ſome diſtance began to appear in all their awful ſublimity; chain riſing over chain in long ſucceſſion, their higher points darken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the hovering clouds, ſometimes hid, and at others ſeen ſhooting up far above them; while their lower ſteeps, broken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fantaſtic forms, were touched with blue and purpliſh tints, which, as they changed in light and ſhade, ſeemed to open new ſcenes to the eye. To the eaſt ſtretched the plains of Lombardy, with the towers of Turin riſing at a diſtance; and beyond the Apennines, bounding the horizon.</p>
                     <p>The general magnificence of that city, with its viſtas of chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and palaces, branching from the grand ſquare, each opening to a landſcape of the diſtant Alps or Appennines, was not only ſuch as Emily had never ſeen in France, but ſuch as ſhe had never imagined.</p>
                     <p>Montoni, who had been often at Turin, and cared little about views of any kind, did not comply with his wife's requeſt, that they might ſurvey ſome of ſhe palaces; but ſtaying only till the neceſſary refreſhments could be obtained, they ſet
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:029378_0088_0FE08014C8704358"/>
forward for Venice with all poſſible rapidity. Montoni's man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, during this journey, was grave, and even haughty; and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Madame Montoni he was more eſpecially reſerved; but it was not the reſerve of reſpect ſo much as of pride and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. Of Emily he took little notice. With Cavigni his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations were commonly on political or military topics, ſuch as the convulſed ſtate of their country rendered at this time par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly intereſting. Emily obſerved, that, at the mention of any daring exploit, Montoni's eyes loſt their ſullenneſs, and ſeemed inſtantaneouſly to gleam with fire; yet they ſtill retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſomewhat of a lurking cunning, and ſhe ſometimes thought that their fire partook more of the glare of malice than the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of valour, though the latter would well have harmonized with the high chivalric air of his figure, in which Cavigni, with all his gay and gallant manners, was his inferior.</p>
                     <p>On entering the Milaneſe, the gentlemen exchanged their French hats for the Italian cap of ſcarlet cloth, embroidered; and Emily was ſomewhat ſurpriſed to obſerve, that Montoni ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to his the military ploom, while Cavigni retained only the feather: which was uſually worn with ſuch caps: but ſhe at length concluded, that Montoni aſſumed this enſign of a ſoldier for convenience, as a means of paſſing with more ſafety through a country, over-run with parties of the military.</p>
                     <p>Over the beautiful plains of this country the devaſtations of war were frequently viſible. Where the lands had not been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to lie uncultivated, they were often tracted with the ſteps of the ſpoiler, the vines were torn down from the branches that had ſupported them, the olives trampled upon the ground, and even the groves of mulberry trees had been hewn by the enemy to light fires that deſtroyed the hamlets and villages of their owners. Emily turned her eyes with a ſigh from theſe painful villages of contention to the Alps of the Griſon, that overlooked them to the north, whoſe awful ſolitudes ſeemed to offer to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted man a ſecure aſylum.</p>
                     <p>The travellers frequently diſtinguiſhed troops of ſoldiers mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a diſtance; and they experienced, at the little inns on the road, the ſcarcity of proviſion and other inconveniences, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> a part of the conſequence of inteſtine war; but they had never reaſon to be much alarmed for their immediate ſafety, and they paſſed on to Milan with little interruption of any kind, where they ſtaid not to ſurvey the grandeur of the city, or even to view its vaſt cathedral, which was then building.</p>
                     <p>Beyond Milan, the country wore the aſpect of a ruder devaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and though every thing ſeemed now quiet, the repoſe
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:029378_0089_0FE08019805DB448"/>
was like that of death, ſpread over features, which retain the impreſſion of the laſt convulſions.</p>
                     <p>It was not till they had paſſed the eaſtern limits of the Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe, that the travellers ſaw any troops ſince they had left Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan, when, as the evening was drawing to a cloſe, they deſcried what appeared to be an army winding onward along the diſtant plains, whoſe ſpears and other arms caught the laſt rays of the ſun. As the column advanced through a part of the road, contracted between two hillocks, ſome of the commanders on horſeback were diſtinguiſhed on a ſmall eminence, pointing and making ſignals for the march; while ſeveral of the officers were riding along the line directing its progreſs, according to the ſigns com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by thoſe above; and others, ſeparating from the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, which had emerged from the paſs, were riding careleſsly along the plains, at ſome diſtance to the right of the army.</p>
                     <p>As they drew nearer, Montoni, diſtinguiſhing the feathers that waved in their caps, and the banners, and liveries of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> that followed them, thought he knew this to be the ſmall army commanded by the famous captain Utaldo, with whom, as well as with ſome of the other chiefs, he was perſonally acquainted. He, therefore, gave orders that the carriages ſhould draw up by the ſide of the road, to await their arrival, and give them the paſs. A faint ſtrain of martial muſic now ſtole by, and, gradual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrengthening as the troops approached, Emily diſtinguiſhed the drums and trumpets, with the claſh of cymbals and of arms, that were ſtruck by a ſmall party, in time to the march.</p>
                     <p>Montoni being now certain that theſe were the bands of the victorious Utaldo, leaned from the carriage window, and hailed their general by waving his cap in the air; which compliment the chief returned by raiſing his ſpear, and then letting it down again ſuddenly, which ſome of his officers, who were riding at a diſtance from the troops, came up to the carriage, and ſaluted Montoni as an old acquaintance. The captain himſelf ſoon after arriving, his bands halted while he converſed with Montoni, whom he appeared much rejoiced to ſee; and from what he ſaid, Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood that this was a victorious army, returning into their own principality; while the numerous waggons, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied them, contained the rich ſpoils of the enemy, their own wounded ſoldiers, and the priſoners they had taken in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, who were to be ranſomed when the peace, then negociating between the neighbouring ſtates, ſhould be ratified. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="177" facs="unknown:029378_0089_0FE08019805DB448"/>
therefore to be an evening of uncommon and general feſtivity, in commemoration of the victory they had accompliſhed together, and of the farewel which the commanders were about to take of each other.</p>
                     <p>Emily, as theſe officers converſed with Montoni, obſerved with admiration, tinctured with awe, their high martial air, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with the haughtineſs of the nobleſſe of thoſe days, and heightened by the gallantry of their dreſs, by the plumes tower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on their caps, the armorial coat, Perſian ſaſh, and ancient Spaniſh cloak. Utaldo, telling Montoni that his army were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to encamp for the night near a village at only a few miles diſtance, invited him to turn back and partake of their feſtivity, aſſuring the ladies alſo, that they ſhould be pleaſantly accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated; but Montoni excuſed himſelf, adding, that it was his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to reach Verona that evening; and, after ſome converſation concerning the ſtate of the country towards that city, they parted.</p>
                     <p>The travellers proceeded without any interruption; but it was ſome hours after ſunſet before they arrived at Verona, whoſe beautiful environs were therefore not ſeen by Emily till the following morning; when, leaving that pleaſant town at an early hour, they ſet off for Padua, where they embarked on the Brenta for Venice. Here the ſcene was entirely changed; no veſtiges of wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, ſuch as had deformed the plains of the Milaneſe, appeared; on the contrary, all was peace and elegance. The verdant banks of the Brenta exhibited a continued landſcape of beauty, gaiety, and ſplendour. Emily gazed with admiration on the villas of the Venetian nobleſſe, with their cool porticos and colonnades, overhung with poplars and cypreſſes of majeſtic height and lively verdure; on their rich orangeries, whoſe bloſſoms perfumed the air, and on the luxuriant willows, that dipped their light leaves in the wave, and ſheltered from the ſun the gay parties whoſe muſic came at intervals on the breeze. The Carnival did, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="178" facs="unknown:029378_0090_0FE0696956229C58"/>
done; ſhe was frequently grave, and Montoni retained his uſual reſerve.</p>
                     <p>Nothing could exceed Emily's admiration, on her firſt view of Venice, with its iſlets, palaces, and towers riſing out of the ſea, whoſe clear ſurface reflected the tremulous picture in all its colours. The ſun, ſinking in the weſt, tinted the waves and the lofty mountains of Friuli, which ſkirt the northern ſhores of the Adriatic, with a ſaffron glow, while on the marble porticos and colonnades of St. Mark were thrown the rich lights and ſhades of evening. As they glided on, the grander features of this city appeared more diſtinctly: its terraces, crowned with airy yet majeſtic fabrics, touched, as they now were, with the ſplendour of the ſetting ſun, appeared as if they had been called up from the ocean by the wand of an enchanter, rather than reared by mortal hands.</p>
                     <p>The ſun, ſoon after, ſinking to the lower world, the ſhad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> of the earth ſtole gradually over the waves, and then up the tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering ſides of the mountains of Friuli, till it extinguiſhed even the laſt upward beams that had lingered on their ſummits, and the melancholy purple of evening drew over them, like a thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> veil. How deep, how beautiful was the tranquillity that wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the ſcene! All nature ſeemed to repoſe; the fineſt emotions of the ſoul were alone awake. Emily's eyes filled with tears of admiration and ſublime devotion, as ſhe raiſed them over the ſleeping world to the vaſt heavens, and heard the notes of ſolemn muſic, that ſtole over the waters from a diſtance. She liſtened in ſtill rapture, and no perſon of the party broke the charm by an inquiry. The ſounds ſeemed to grow on the air; for ſo ſmoothly did the barge glide along, that its motion was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable, and the fairy city appeared approaching to welcome the ſtrangers. They now diſtinguiſhed a female voice, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by a few inſtruments, ſinging a ſoft and mournful air; and its fine expreſſion, as ſometimes it ſeemed pleading with the impaſſioned tenderneſs of love, and then languiſhing into the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of hopeleſs grief, declared, that it flowed from no feigned ſenſibility. Ah! thought Emily, as ſhe ſighed and remembered Valancourt, thoſe ſtrains come from the heart!</p>
                     <p>She looked round, with anxious inquiry; the deep twilight, that had fallen over the ſcene, admitted only imperfect images to the eye, but, at ſome diſtance on the ſea, ſhe thought ſhe perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a gondola: a chorus of voices and inſtruments now ſwelled on the air—ſo ſweet, ſo ſolemn! it ſeemed like the hymn of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels deſcending through the ſilence of night! Now it died away,
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:029378_0090_0FE0696956229C58"/>
and fancy almoſt beheld the holy choir reaſcending towards hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; then again it ſwelled with the breeze, trembled awhile, and again died into ſilence. It brought to Emily's recollection <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> lines of her late father, and ſhe repeated in a low voice,

                           <l>That bears the ſoul to heaven!</l>

                     </p>
                     <p>The deep ſtillneſs, that ſucceeded, was as expreſſive as the ſtrain that had juſt ceaſed. It was uninterrupted for ſeveral minutes, till a general ſigh ſeemed to releaſe the company from their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment. Emily, however, long indulged the pleaſing ſadneſs, that had ſtolen upon her ſpirits; but the gay and buſy ſcene that appeared, as the barge approached St. Mark's Place, at length rouſed her attention. The riſing moon, which threw a ſhadowy light upon the terraces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and illumined the porticos and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent arcades that crown<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The muſic they heard before now paſſed Montoni's barge, in one of the gondolas, of which ſeveral were ſeen ſkimming along the moonlight ſea, full of gay parties, catching the cool breeze. Moſt of theſe had muſic, made ſweeter by the waves over which it floated, and by the meaſured ſound of oars, as they daſhed the ſparkling tide. Emily gazed, and liſtened, and thought herſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>The barge paſſed on to the grand canal, where Montoni's manſion was ſituated. And here, other forms of beauty and of grandeur, ſuch as her imagination had never painted, were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded to Emily in the palaces of Sanſovino and Palladio, as ſhe glided along the waves. The air bore no ſounds, but thoſe of ſweetneſs, echoing along each margin of the canal, and from gondolas on its ſurface, while groups of maſks were ſeen dancing on the moonlight terraces, and ſeemed almoſt to realize the ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of fairy-land.</p>
                     <p>The barge ſtopped before the portico of a large houſe, from whence a ſervant of Montoni croſſed the terrace, and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the party diſembarked. From the portico they paſſed a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hall to a ſtaircaſe of marble, which led to a ſaloon, fitted up
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:029378_0091_0FE0802F8F25F9B8"/>
in a ſtyle of magnificence that ſurpriſed Emily. The walls and ceiling were adorned with hiſtorical and allegorical paintings in <hi>freſco;</hi> ſilver tripods, depending from chains of the ſame metal, illumined the apartment, the floor of which was covered with Indian mats painted in a variety of colours and devices; the couches and drapery of the lattices were of pale green ſilk, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered and fringed with green and gold. Balcony lattices opened upon the grand canal, whence roſe a confuſion of voices and of muſical inſtruments, and the breeze that gave freſhneſs to the apartment. Emily, conſidering the gloomy temper of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni, looked upon the ſplendid furniture of his houſe with ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, and remembered the report of his being a man of broken fortune with aſtoniſhment. "Ah!" ſaid ſhe to herſelf, "if Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt could but ſee this manſion, what peace would it give him! He would then be convinced that the report was groundleſs."</p>
                     <p>Madame Montoni ſeemed to aſſume the airs of a princeſs; but Montoni was reſtleſs and diſcontented, and did not even ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the civility of bidding her welcome to her home.</p>
                     <p>Soon after his arrival, he ordered his gondola, and, with Cav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igni, went out to mingle in the ſcenes of the evening. Madame then became ſerious and thoughtful. Emily who was charmed with every thing ſhe ſaw, endeavoured to enliven her; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection had not, with Madame Montoni, ſubdued caprice and ill humour, and her anſwers diſcovered ſo much of both, that Emily gave up the attempt of diverting her, and withdrew to a lattice, to amuſe herſelf with the ſcene without, ſo new and ſo enchanting.</p>
                     <p>The firſt object that attracted her notice was a group of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers on the terrace below, led by a guitar, and ſome other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments. The girl, who ſtruck the guitar, and another, who flouriſhed a tomborine, paſſed on in a dancing ſtep, and with a light grace and gaiety of heart, that would have ſubdued the goddeſs of ſpleen in her worſt humour. After theſe came a group of fantaſtic figures, ſome dreſſed as gondolieri, others as minſtrels, while others ſeemed to defy all deſcription. They ſung in parts, their voices accompanied by a few ſoft inſtruments. At a little diſtance from the portico they ſtopped, and Emily diſtinguiſhed the verſes of Arioſto. They ſung of the wars of the Moors againſt Charlemagne, and then of the woes of Orlando: afterwards the meaſure changed, and the melancholy ſweetneſs of Petrach ſucceeded. The magic of his grief was aſſiſted by all that Italian muſic and Italian expreſſion, heightened by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments of Venetian moonlight, could give.</p>
                     <p>Emily, as ſhe liſtened, caught the penſive enthuſiaſm; her tears flowed ſilently, while her fancy bore her far away to France
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:029378_0091_0FE0802F8F25F9B8"/>
and to Valancourt. Each ſucceeding ſonnet, more full of charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſadneſs than the laſt, ſeemed to bind the ſpell of melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: with extreme regret ſhe ſaw the muſicians move on, and her attention followed the ſtrain till the laſt faint warble died in air. She then remained ſunk in that penſive tranquillity which ſoft muſic leaves on th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> mind—a ſtate like that produced by the view of a beautiful landſcape by moonlight, or by the recollection of ſcenes marked with the tenderneſs of friends loſt for ever, and with ſorrows, which time has mellowed into mild regret. Such ſcenes are indeed, to the mind, like "thoſe faint traces which the memory bears of muſic that is paſt."</p>
                     <p>Other ſounds ſoon awakened her attention: it was the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn harmony of horns, that ſwelled from a diſtance; and, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the gondolas arrange themſelves along the margin of the terraces, ſhe threw on her veil, and ſtepping into the balcony, diſcerned in the diſtant perſpective of the canal, ſomething like a proceſſion, floating on the light ſurface of the water: as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, the horns and other inſtruments mingled ſweetly, and ſoon after the fabled deities of the city ſeemed to have ariſen from the ocean; for Neptune, with Venus perſonified as his queen, came on the undulating waves, ſurrounded by tritons and ſea-nymphs. The fantaſtic ſplendour of this ſpectacle, together with the grandeur of the ſurrounding palaces, appeared like the viſion of a poet ſuddenly embodied, and the fanciful images which it awakened in Emily's mind, lingered there long after the proceſſion had paſſed away. She indulged herſelf in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agining what might be the manners and delights of a ſea-nymph, till ſhe almoſt wiſhed to throw off the habit of mortality, and plunge into the green wave to participate them.</p>
                     <p>"How delightful," ſaid ſhe, "to live amidſt the coral bowers and cryſtal caverns of the ocean, with my ſiſter nymphs, and liſten to the ſounding waters above, and to the ſoft ſhells of the tritons! and then, after ſunſet, to ſkim on the ſurface of the waves round wild rocks and along ſequeſtered ſhores, where, perhaps, ſome penſive wanderer comes to weep! Then would I ſooth his ſorrows with my ſweet muſic, and offer him from a ſhell ſome of the delicious fruit that hangs round Neptune's palace."</p>
                     <p>She was recalled from her reverie to a mere mortal ſupper, and could not forbear ſmiling at the fancies ſhe had been indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and at her conviction of the ſerious diſpleaſure, which Madame Montoni would have expreſſed, could ſhe have been made acquainted with them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="182" facs="unknown:029378_0092_0FE0803C8F492D70"/>
After ſupper, her aunt ſat late, but Montoni did not return, and ſhe at length retired to reſt. If Emily had admired the magnificence of the ſaloon, ſhe was not leſs ſurpriſed, on obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the half furniſhed and, forlorn appearance of the apartments ſhe paſſed in the way to her chamber, whither ſhe went through long ſuites of noble rooms, that ſeemed, from their deſolate aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, to have been unoccupied for many years. On the walls of ſome were the faded remains of tapeſtry; from others, painted in <hi>freſco,</hi> the damps had almoſt withdrawn both colours and deſign. At length ſhe reached her own chamber, ſpacious, deſolate and lofty, like the reſt, with high lattices that opened towards the Adriatic. It brought gloomy images to her mind, but the view of the Adriatic ſoon gave her others more airy, among which was that of the ſea-nymph, whoſe delights ſhe had before amuſed herſelf with picturing; and, anxious to eſcape from ſerious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, ſhe now endeavoured to throw her fanciful ideas into a train, and concluded the hour with compoſing the following lines:</p>

                     <p>MONTONI and his companion did not return home, till many hours after the dawn had bluſhed upon the Adriatic.—The airy groups, which had danced all night along the colon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nade of St. Mark, diſperſed before the morning, like ſo many ſpirits. Monto I had been otherwiſe engaged; his ſoul was little ſuſceptible of light pleaſures. He delighted in the ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies of the paſſions; the difficulties and tempeſts of life, which wreck the happineſs of others, rouſed and ſtrengthened all the powers of his mind, and afforded him the higheſt enjoyments, of which his nature was capable. Without ſome object of ſtrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, life was to him little more than a ſleep; and, when pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits of real intereſt failed, he ſubſtituted artificial ones, till habit changed their nature, and they ceaſed to be unreal. Of this kind was the habit of gaming, which he had adopted, firſt, for the purpoſe of relieving him from the languor of inaction, but had ſince purſued with the ardour of paſſion. In this occupation he had paſſed the night with Cavigni and a party of young men, who had more money than rank, and more vice than either.—Montoni deſpiſed the greater part of theſe for the inferiority of their talents, rather than from their vicious inclinations, and aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated with them only to make them the inſtruments of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. Among theſe, however, were ſome of ſuperior abilities, and a few whom Montoni admitted to his intimacy, but even towards theſe he ſtill preſerved a deciſive and haughty air, which, while it impoſed ſubmiſſion on weak and timid minds, rouſed the fierce hatred of ſtrong ones. He had, of courſe, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and bitter enemies; but the rancour of their hatred proved the degree of his power; and, as power was his chief aim, he gloried more in ſuch hatred, than it was poſſible he could in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſteemed. A feeling ſo tempered as that of eſteem, he deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed,
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:029378_0094_0FE080492BD413D8"/>
and would have deſpiſed himſelf alſo had he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf capable of being flattered by it.</p>
                     <p>Among the few whom he diſtinguiſhed, were the Signors Bertolini, Orſino, and Verezzi. The firſt was a man of a gay temper, ſtrong paſſions, diſſipated, and of unbounded extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, but generous, brave, and unſuſpicious. Orſino was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and haughty; loving power more then oſtentation; of a cruel and ſuſpicious temper; quick to feel an injury, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentleſs in avenging it; cunning and unſearchable in contrivance, patient and indefatigable in the execution of his ſchemes. He had a perfect command of feature and of his paſſions, of which he had ſcarcely any, but pride, revenge and avarice; and, in the gratification of theſe, few conſiderations had power to reſtrain him, few obſtacles to withſtand the depth of his ſtratagems. This man was the chief favourite of Montoni, Verezzi was a man of ſome talent, of fiery imagination, and the ſlave of alternate paſſions. He was gay, voluptuous, and daring; yet had neither perſeverance or true courage, and was meanly ſelfiſh in all his aims. Quick to form ſchemes, and ſanguine in his hope of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, he was the firſt to undertake, and to abandon, not only his own plans, but thoſe adopted from other perſons. Proud and impetuous, he revolted againſt all ſubordination, yet thoſe who were acquainted with his character, and watched the turn of his paſſions, could lead him like a child.</p>
                     <p>Such were the friends whom Montoni introduced to his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and his table on the day after his arrival at Venice. There were alſo of the party a Venetian nobleman, Count Morano, and a Signora Livona, whom Montoni had introduced to his wife, as a lady of diſtinguiſhed merit, and who, having called in the morning to welcome her to Venice, had been requeſted to be of the dinner party.</p>
                     <p>Madame Montoni received, with a very ill grace, the compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Signors. She diſliked them, becauſe they were the friends of her huſband; hated them becauſe ſhe believed they had contributed to detain him abroad till ſo late an hour of the preceding morning; and envied them, ſince conſcious of her own want of influence, ſhe was convinced, that he preferred their ſociety to her own. The rank of Count Morano procured him that diſtinction which ſhe refuſed to the reſt of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. The haughty ſullenneſs of her countenance and manner, and the oſtentatious extravagance of her dreſs, for ſhe had not yet adopted the Venetian habit, were ſtrikingly contraſted by the beauty, modeſty, ſweetneſs and ſimplicity of Emily, who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:029378_0094_0FE080492BD413D8"/>
with more attention than pleaſure, the party around her. The beauty and faſcinating manners of Signora Livona, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, won her involuntary regard; while the ſweetneſs of her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents and her air of gentle kindneſs awakened with Emily thoſe pleaſing affections, which ſo long had ſlumbered.</p>
                     <p>In the cool of the evening the party embarked in Montoni's gondola, and rowed out upon the ſea, The red glow of ſunſet ſtill touch'd the waves, and lingered in the weſt, where the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly gleam ſeemed ſlowly expiring, while the dark blue of the upper aether began to twinkle with ſtars. Emily ſat, given up to penſive and ſweet emotions. The ſmoothneſs of the water ever which ſhe glided, its reflected images—a new heaven and trembling ſtars below the waves, with ſhadowy outlines of tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and porticos, conſpired with the ſtillneſs of the hour, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted only by the paſſing wave, or the notes of diſtant muſic, to raiſe thoſe emotions to enthuſiaſm. As ſhe liſtened to the meaſured ſound of the oars, and to the remote warblings that came in the breeze, her ſoftened mind returned to the memory of St. Aubert and to Valancourt, and tears ſtole to her eyes. The rays of the moon, ſtrengthening, as the ſhadows deepened, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> after threw a ſilvery gleam upon her countenance, which was partly ſhaded by a thin black veil, and touched it with inimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſoftneſs. Hers was the <hi>contour</hi> of a Madona, with the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of a Magdalen; and the penſive uplifted eye with the tear that glittered on her cheek confirmed the expreſſion of the character.</p>
                     <p>The laſt ſtrain of diſtant muſic now died in air, for the gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dola was far upon the waves, and the party determined to have muſic of their own. The Count Morano, who ſat next to Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and who had been obſerving her for ſometime in ſilence, ſnatched up a lute, and ſtruck the chords with the finger of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, herſelf, while his voice, a fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The cadence with which he returned from the laſt ſtanza to a repetition of the firſt; the fine modulation in which his voice ſtole upon the firſt line, and the pathetic energy with which it pronounced the laſt, were ſuch as only exquiſite taſte could give. When he had concluded, he gave the lute with a ſigh to Emily, who, to avoid any appearance of affectation, immediately began to play. She ſung a melancholy little air, one of the popular ſongs of her native province, with a ſimplicity and pathos that made it enchanting. But its well-known melody brought ſo forcibly to her fancy the ſcenes and the perſons, among which ſhe had often heard it, that her ſpirits were overcome, her voice trembled and ceaſed—and the ſtrings of the lute were ſtruck with a diſordered hand; till, aſhamed of the emotion ſhe had betrayed, ſhe ſuddenly paſſed on to a ſong ſo gay and airy, that the ſteps of the dance ſeemed almoſt to echo to the notes. <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſſimo!</hi> burſt inſtantly from the lips of her delighted auditors, and ſhe was compelled to repeat the air. Among the compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that followed, thoſe of the Count were not the leaſt audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and they had not concluded, when Emily gave the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Signora Livona, whoſe voice accompanied it with true Italian taſte.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards the Count, Emily, Cavigni, and the Signora, ſung <hi>canzone<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>tes,</hi> accompanied by a couple of lutes and a few other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments.
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:029378_0095_0FE0804ED688D838"/>
Sometimes the inſtruments ſuddenly ceaſed, and the voices dropped from the full ſwell of harmony into a low chant; then, after a deep pauſe, they roſe by degrees, the inſtruments one by one ſtriking up, till the loud and full chorus ſoared again to heaven!</p>
                     <p>Meanwhile, Montoni, who was weary of this harmony, was conſidering how he might diſengage himſelf from his party, or withdraw with ſuch of it as would be willing to play, to a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſino. In a pauſe of the muſic, he propoſed returning to ſhore, a propoſal which Orſino eagerly ſeconded, but which the Count and the other gentlemen as warmly oppoſed.</p>
                     <p>Montoni ſtill meditated how he might excuſe himſelf from longer attendance upon the Count, for to him only he thought excuſe neceſſary, and how he might get to land, till the gondo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieri of an empty boat, returning to Venice, hailed his people. Without troubling himſelf longer about an excuſe, he ſeized this opportunity of going thither, and, committing the ladies to the care of his friends, departed with Orſino, while Emily, for the firſt time ſaw him go with regret; for ſhe conſidered his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence a protection, though ſhe knew not what ſhe ſhould fear. He landed at St. Mark's, and, hurrying to a Caſino, was ſoon loſt amidſt a crowd of gameſters.</p>
                     <p>Meanwhile, the Count having ſecretly diſpatched a ſervant in Montoni's boat, for his own gondola and muſicians, Emily, heard without knowing his project, the gay ſong of gondolieri approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as they ſat on the ſtern of the boat, and ſaw the tremulous gleam of the moonlight wave, which their oars diſturbed. Preſently ſhe heard the ſound of inſtruments, and then a full ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phony ſwelled on the air, and, the boats meeting, the gondolieri hailed each other. The Count then explaining himſelf, the party removed into his gondola, which was embelliſhed with all that taſte could beſtow.</p>
                     <p>While they partook of a collation of fruits and ice, the whole <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>end, following at a diſtance, in the other boat, played the moſt ſweet and enchanting ſtrains, and the Count, who had again ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf by Emily, paid her unremitted attention, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in a low but impaſſioned voice, uttered compliments which ſhe could not miſunderſtand. To avoid them ſhe converſed with Signora Livona, and her manner to the Count aſſumed a mild reſerve, which, though dignified, was too gentle to repreſs his aſſiduities: he could ſee, hear, ſpeak to no perſon, but Emily, while Cavigni obſerved him now and then, with a look of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, and Emily, with one of uneaſineſs. She now wiſhed
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:029378_0096_0FE0805B53D83728"/>
for nothing ſo much as to return to Venice, but it was near mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night before the gondolas approached St. Mark's Place, where the voice of gaiety and ſong was loud. The buſy hum of ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſounds was heard at a conſiderable diſtance on the water, and, had not a bright moonlight diſcovered the city, with its terraces and towers, a ſtranger would almoſt have credited the fabled wonders of Neptune's court, and believed, that the tumult aroſe from beneath the waves.</p>
                     <p>They landed at St. Mark's, where the gaiety of the colonnades and the beauty of the night, made Madame Montoni willingly ſubmit to the Count's ſolicitations to join the promenade, and afterwards to take a ſupper with the reſt of the party, at his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſino. If any thing could have diſſipated Emily's uneaſineſs, it would have been the grandeur, gaiety, and novelty of the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding ſcene, adorned with Palladio's palaces, and buſy with parties of maſqueraders.</p>
                     <p>At length they withdrew to the Caſino, which was fitted up with infinite taſte, and where a ſplendid banquet was prepared; but here Emily's reſerve made the Count perceive, that it was neceſſary for his intereſt to win the favour of Madame Montoni, which, from the condeſcenſion ſhe had already ſhewn to him, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be an achievement of no great difficulty. He transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, therefore, part of his attention from Emily to her aunt, who felt too much flattered by the diſtinction even to diſguiſe her emotion; and, before the party broke up, he had intirely engaged the eſteem of Madame Montoni. Whenever he addreſſed her, her ungracious countenance relaxed into ſmiles, and to whatever h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> propoſed ſhe aſſented. He invited her, with the reſt of the party, to take coffee, in his box at the opera, on the following evening, and Emily heard the invitation accepted, with ſtrong anxiety, concerning the means of excuſing herſelf from attending Madame Montoni thither.</p>
                     <p>It was very late before their gondola was ordered, and Emily's ſurpriſe was extreme, when on quitting the Caſino, ſhe beheld the broad ſun riſing out of the Adriatic, while St. Mark's Place was yet crowded with company. Sleep had long weighed heavily on her eyes, but now the freſh ſea breeze revived her, and ſhe would have quitted the ſcene with regret, had not the Count been preſent, performing the duty, which he had impoſed upon himſelf, of eſcorting them home. There they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ard that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni was not yet returned; and his wife, retiring in diſpleaſure to her apartment, at length releaſed Emily from the fatigue of further attendance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="191" facs="unknown:029378_0096_0FE0805B53D83728"/>
Montoni came home late in the morning, in a very ill humour, having loſt conſiderably at play, and, before he withdrew to reſt, had a private conference with Cavigni, whoſe manner, on the following day, ſeemed to tell, that the ſubject of it had not been pleaſing to him.</p>
                     <p>In the evening, Madame Montoni, who, during the day, had obſerved a ſullen ſilence towards her huſband, received viſits from ſome Venetian ladies, with whoſe ſweet manners Emily was particularly charmed. They had an air of eaſe and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards the ſtrangers, as if they had been their familiar friends for years; and their converſation was by turns tender, ſentimental and gay. Madame, though ſhe had no taſte for ſuch converſation, and whoſe coarſeneſs and ſelfiſhneſs ſometimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited a ludicrous contraſt to their exceſſive refinement, could not remain wholly inſenſible to the captivations of their manner.</p>
                     <p>In a pauſe of converſation, a lady who was called Signora Herminia took up a lute, and began to play and ſing, with as much eaſy gaiety, as if ſhe had been alone. Her voice was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commonly rich in tone, and various in expreſſion; yet ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be entirely unconſcious of its powers, and meant noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leſs than to diſplay them. She ſung from the gaiety of her heart, as ſhe ſat with her veil half thrown back, holding grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully the lute, under the ſpreading foliage and flowers of ſome plants that roſe from baſkets, and interlaced one of the lattices of the ſaloon. Emily, retiring a little from the company, ſketch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her figure, with the miniature ſcenery around her, and drew a very intereſting picture, which, though it would not, perhaps have borne criticiſm, had ſpirit and taſte enough to a waken both the fancy and the heart. When ſhe had finiſhed it, ſhe preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to the beautiful original, who was delighted with the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, as well as the ſentiment it conveyed, and aſſured Emily, with a ſmile of captivating ſweetneſs, that ſhe ſhould preſerve it, as a pledge of her friendſhip.</p>
                     <p>In the evening Cavigni joined the ladies, but Montoni had other engagements; and they embarked in the gondola for St. Mark's, were the ſame gay company ſeemed to flutter as on the preceding night. The cool breeze, the glaſſy ſea, the gentle ſound of its waves, and the ſweeter murmur of diſtant muſic; the lofty porticos and arcades, and the happy groups that ſaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered beneath them; theſe, with every feature and circumſtance of the ſcene, united to charm Emily, no longer teaſed by the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficious attentions of Count Morano. But, as ſhe looked upon the moonlight ſea, undulating along the walls of St. Mark, and
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:029378_0097_0FE0805FEBEB4558"/>
lingering for a moment over thoſe walls, caught the ſweet and melancholy ſong of ſome gondolier as he ſat in his boat below, waiting for his maſter, her ſoftened mind returned to the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of her home, of her friends and of all that was dear in her native country.</p>
                     <p>After walking ſometime, they ſat down at the door of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſino, and, while Cavigni was accommodating them with coffee and ice, were joined by Count Morano. He ſought Emily with a look of impatient delight, who, remembering all the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention he had ſhewn her on the preceding evening, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, as before, to ſhrink from his aſſiduities into a timid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, except when ſhe converſed with Signora Herminia and the other ladies of her party.</p>
                     <p>It was near midnight before they withdrew to the opera, where Emily was not ſo charmed but that, when ſhe remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſcene ſhe had juſt quitted, ſhe felt how infinitely inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or all the ſplendor of art is to the ſublimity of nature. Her heart was not now affected, tears of admiration did not ſtart to her eyes, as when ſhe viewed the vaſt expanſe of ocean, the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of the heavens, and liſtened to the rolling waters, and to the faint muſic that, at intervals, mingled with their roar. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membering theſe, the ſcene before her faded into inſignificance.</p>
                     <p>Of the evening, which paſſed on without any particular inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſhe wiſhed the concluſion, that ſhe might eſcape from the attentions of the Count; and, as oppoſite qualities frequently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract each other in our thoughts, thus Emily, when ſhe looked on Count Morano, remembered Valancourt, and a ſigh ſometimes followed the recollection.</p>
                     <p>Several weeks paſſed in the courſe of cuſtomary viſits, during which nothing remarkable occurred. Emily was amuſed by the manners and ſcenes that ſurrounded her, ſo different from thoſe of France, but where Count Morano, too frequently for her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, contrived to introduce himſelf. His manner, figure and accompliſhments, which were generally admired, Emily would, perhaps, have admired alſo, had her heart been diſengaged from Valancourt, and had the Count <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>orbo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e to perſecute her with officious attentions, during which ſhe obſerved ſome traits in his character, that prejudiced her againſt whatever might otherwiſe be good in it.</p>
                     <p>Soon after his arrival at Venice, Montoni received a packet from M. Queſnel, in which the latter mentioned the death of his wife's uncle, at his villia on the Brenta; and that, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this event, he ſhould haſten to take poſſeſſion of that
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:029378_0097_0FE0805FEBEB4558"/>
eſtate and of other effects bequeathed to him. This uncle was the brother of Madame Queſnel's late mother; Montoni was related to her by the father's ſide, and though he could have had neither claim nor expectation concerning theſe poſſeſſions, he could ſcarcely conceal the envy which M. Queſnel's letter excited.</p>
                     <p>Emily had obſerved with concern, that, ſince they left France, Montoni had not even affected kindneſs towards her aunt, and that, after treating her, at firſt with neglect, he now met her with uniform ill humour and reſerve. She had never ſuppoſed, that her aunt's foibles could have eſcaped the diſcernment of Monto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, or that her mind or figure were of a kind to deſerve his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. Her ſurpriſe, therefore, at this match, had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme; but ſince he had made the choice, ſhe did not ſuſpect that he would ſo openly have diſcovered his contempt of it. But Montoni, who had been allured by the ſeeming wealth of Madame Cheron, was now ſeverely diſappointed by her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative poverty, and highly exaſperated by the deceit ſhe had employed to conceal it, till concealment, was no longer neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. He had been deceived in an affair, wherein he meant to be the deceiver; outwitted by the ſuperior cunning of a woman, whoſe underſtanding he deſpiſed, and to whom he had ſacrificed his pride and his liberty, without ſaving himſelf from the ruin, which had impended over his head. Madame Montoni had contrived to have the greateſt part of what ſhe really did poſſeſs, ſettled upon herſelf: what remained, though it was totally inade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate both to her huſband's expectations, and to his neceſſities, he had converted into money, and brought with him to Venice, that he might a little longer delude ſociety, and make a laſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to regain the fortunes he had loſt.</p>
                     <p>The hints which had been thrown out to Valancourt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Montoni's character and condition, were too true; but it was now left to time and occaſion, to unfold the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, both of what had, and what had not been hinted, and to time and occaſion we commit them.</p>
                     <p>Madame Montoni was not of a nature to bear injuries with meekneſs, or to reſent them with dignity: her exaſperated pride diſplayed itſelf in all the violence and acrimony of a little, or at leaſt an ill-regulated mind. She would not acknowledge, even to herſelf, that ſhe had in any degree provoked contempt by her duplicity, but weakly perſiſted in believing, that ſhe alone was to be pitied, and Montoni, alone to be cenſured; for, as her mind had naturally little perception of moral obligation,
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:029378_0098_0FE0806CEC0729F8"/>
ſhe ſeldom underſtood its force but when it happened to be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated towards herſelf; her vanity had already been ſeverely ſhocked by a diſcovery of Montoni's contempt; i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> remained to be farther reproved by a diſcovery of his circumſtances. His manſion at Venice, though its furniture diſcovered a part of the truth to unprejudiced perſons, told nothing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> wiſhed. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame Montoni ſtill thought herſelf little leſs than a princeſs, poſſeſſing a palace at Venice, and a caſtle among the Apennines. To the caſtle of Udolpho, indeed Montoni ſometimes talked of going for a few weeks to examine into its condition, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſome rents; for it appeared that he had not been there for two years, and that, during this period it had been inhabited only by an old ſervant, whom he called his ſteward.</p>
                     <p>Emily liſtened to the mention of this journey with pleaſure, for ſhe not only expected from it new ideas, but a releaſe from the perſevering aſſiduities of Count Morano. In the country, too ſhe would have leiſure to think of Valancourt, and to indulge the melancholy, which his image, and a recollection of the ſcenes of La Vallee, always bleſſed with the memory of her parents, awakened. The ideal ſcenes were dearer, and more ſoothing to her heart, than all the ſplendour of gay aſſemblies; they were a kind of taliſman that expelled the poiſon of temporary evils, and ſupported her hopes of happy days: they appeared like a beautiful landſcape, lighted up by a gleam of ſunſhine, and ſeen through a perſpective of dark and rugged rocks.</p>
                     <p>But Count Morano did not long confine himſelf to ſilent aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duities; he declared his paſſion to Emily, and made propoſals to Montoni, who encouraged though Emily rejected, him: with Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni for his friend, and an abundance of vanity to delude him, he did not deſpair of ſucceſs. Emily was aſtoniſhed and highly diſguſted at his perſeverance, after ſhe had explained her ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with a frankneſs that would not allow him to miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them.</p>
                     <p>He now paſſed the greater part of his time a Montoni's, din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there almoſt daily, and attending Madame and Emily where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they went; and all this, notwithſtanding the uniform re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of Emily, whoſe aunt ſeemed as anxious an Montoni to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote this marriage; and would never diſpenſe with her atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance at any aſſembly where the Count propoſed to be preſent.</p>
                     <p>Montoni now ſaid nothing of his intended journey, of which Emily waited impatiently to hear; and he was ſeldom at home but when the Count, or Signor Orſino, was there, for, between
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:029378_0098_0FE0806CEC0729F8"/>
himſelf and Cavigni a coolneſs ſeemed to ſubſiſt, though the latter remained in his houſe. With Orſino, Montoni was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cloſeted for hours together, and, whatever might be the buſineſs, upon which they conſulted, it appeared to be of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, ſince Montoni often ſacrificed to it his favourite paſſion for play, and remained at home the whole night. There was ſomewhat of privacy, too, in the manner of Orſino's viſits, which had never before occurred, and which excited not only ſurpriſe, but ſome degree of alarm in Emily's mind, who had unwillingly diſcovered much of his character when he had moſt endeavoured to diſguiſe it. After theſe viſits, Montoni was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten more thoughtful than uſual; ſometimes the deep workings of his mind entirely abſtracted him from ſurrounding objects, and threw a gloom over his viſage that rendered it terrible; at others, his eyes ſeemed almoſt to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> fire, and all the energies of his ſoul appeared to be rouſed for ſome great enterpriſe. Emily obſerved theſe written characters of his thoughts with deep intereſt, and not without ſome degree of awe, when ſhe conſidered that ſhe was entirely in his power; but forbore even to hint her fears, or her obſervations, to Madame Montoni, who diſcerned nothing in her huſband, at theſe times, but his uſual ſternneſs.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond letter from M. Queſnel announced the arrival of himſelf and his lady at the villa Miar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nti; ſtated ſeveral circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his good fortune, reſpecting the affair that had brought him into Italy; and concluded with an earneſt requeſt to ſee Montoni, his wife and niece at his new eſtate.</p>
                     <p>Emily received about the ſame period, a much more intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing letter, and which ſoothed for a while every anxiety of her heart. Valancourt hoping ſhe might be ſtill at Venice, had truſted a letter to the ordinary poſt, that told her of his health, and of his unceaſing and anxious affection. He had lingered at Tholouſe for ſometime after her departure, that he might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge the melanchoy pleaſure of wandering through the ſcenes where he had been accuſtomed to behold her, and had thence gone to his brother's chateau, which was in the neighbourhood of La Vallee. Having mentioned this, he added, "If the duty of attending my regiment did not require my departure, I know not when I ſhould have reſolution enough to quit the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of a place which is endeared by the remembrance of you. The vicinity to La Vallee has alone detained me thus long at Eſtuviere: I frequently ride thither early in the morning, that I may wander, at leiſure, through the day, among ſcenes, which were once your home, where I have been accuſtomed to
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:029378_0099_0FE0807184BA4808"/>
ſee you, and to hear you converſe. I have renewed my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the good old Thereſa, who rejoiced to ſee me, that ſhe might talk of you: I need not ſay how much this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance attached me to her, or how eagerly I liſtened to her upon her favourite ſubject. You will gueſs the motive that firſt indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced me to make myſelf known to Thereſa: it was, indeed, no other than that of gaining admittance into the chateau and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, which my Emily had ſo lately inhabited: here, then, I wander, and meet your image under every ſhade: but chiefly I love to ſit beneath the ſpreading branches of your favourite plane, where once, Emily, we ſat together; where I firſt ventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to tell you, that I loved. O Emily! the remembrance of thoſe moments overcomes me, I ſit loſt in reverie, I endeavour to ſee you dimly through my tears, in all the heaven of peace and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, ſuch as you then appeared to me; to hear again the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents of that voice, which then thrilled my heart with tenderneſs and hope. I lean on the wall of the terrace, where we together watched the rapid current of the Garonne below, while I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the wild ſcenery about its ſource, but thought only of you. O Emily! are theſe moments paſſed for ever—will they never more return?"</p>
                     <p>In another part of his letter he wrote thus. "You ſee my letter is dated on many different days, and, if you look back to the firſt, you will perceive that I began to write ſoon after your departure from France. To write was, indeed, the only em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment that withdrew me from my own melancholy, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered your abſence ſupportable, or rather, it ſeemed to deſtroy abſence; for, when I was converſing with you o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> paper, and telling you every ſentiment and affection of my heart, you almoſt appeared to be preſent. This employment has been from time to time my chief conſolation, and I have deferred ſending off my packet, merely for the comfort of prolonging it, though it was certain, that what I had written, was written to no purpoſe till you received it. Whenever my mind has been more than uſually depreſſed I have come to pour forth its ſorrows to you, and have always found conſolation; and, when any little occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence has intereſted my heart, and given a gleam of joy to my ſpirits, I have haſtened to communicate it to you, and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived reflected ſatisfaction. Thus, my letter is a kind of pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of my life and of my thoughts for the laſt month, and thus, though it has been deeply intereſting to me, while I wrote it, and I dare hope will, for the ſame reaſon, be not indifferent to you, yet to other readers it would ſeem to abound only in frivol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities.
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:029378_0099_0FE0807184BA4808"/>
Thus it is always, when we attempt to deſcribe the finer movements of the heart, for they are too fine to be diſcerned, they can only be experienced, and are therefore paſſed over by the indifferent obſerver, while the intereſted one feels, that all deſcription is imperfect and unneceſſary, except as it may prove the ſincerity of the writer, and ſooth his own ſufferings. You will pardon all this egotiſm—for I am a lover."</p>
                     <p>"I have juſt heard of a circumſtance, which entirely deſtroys all my fairy paradiſe of ideal delight, and which will recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile me to the neceſſity of returning to my regiment, for I muſt no longer wander beneath the beloved ſhades, where I have been accuſtomed to meet you in thought. La Vallee is let! I have reaſon to believe this is without your knowledge, from what Thereſa told me this morning, and, therefore, I mention the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance. She ſhed tears, while ſhe related, that ſhe was going to leave the ſervice of her dear miſtreſs, and the chateau where ſhe had lived ſo many happy years; and all this, added ſhe, without even a letter from Mademoiſelle to ſoften the news; but it is all M. Queſnel's doings, and I dare ſay ſhe does not even know what is going forward."</p>
                     <p>"Thereſa added, That ſhe had received a letter from him, informing her that the chateau was let, and that, as her ſervices would no longer be required, ſhe muſt quit the place, on that day week, when the new tenant would arrive."</p>
                     <p>"Thereſa had been ſurpriſed by a viſit from M. Queſnel, ſometime before the receipt of this letter, who was accompanied by a ſtranger that viewed the premiſes with much curioſity."</p>
                     <p>Towards the concluſion of his letter, which is dated a week after this ſentence, Valancourt adds, "I have received a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons from my regiment, and I join it without regret, ſince I am ſhut out from the ſcenes that are ſo intereſting to my heart. I rode to La Vallee this morning, and heard that the new tenant was arrived, and that Thereſa was gone. I ſhould not treat the ſubject thus familiarly if I did not believe you to be uninformed of this diſpoſal of your houſe; for your ſatisfaction I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to learn ſomething of the charcter and fortune of your tenant, but without ſucceſs. He is a gentleman, they ſay, and this is all I can hear. The place, as I wandered round the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries, appeared more melancholy to my imagaintion, than I had ever ſeen it. I wiſhed earneſtly to have got admittance, that I might have taken another leave of your favourite plane-tree, and thought of you once more beneath its ſhade: but I forbore to tempt the curioſity of ſtrangers: the fiſhing-houſe in

the woods, however, was ſtill open to me; thither I went, and paſſed an hour, which I cannot even look back upon without emotion. O Emily! ſurely we are not ſeparated forever—ſurely we ſhall live for each other!"</p>
                     <p>This letter brought many tears to Emily's eyes; t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ars of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and ſatisfaction on learning that Valancourt was well, and that time and abſence had in no degree effaced her image from his heart. There were paſſages in this letter which par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly affected her, ſuch as thoſe deſcribing his viſits to La Vallee, and the ſentiments of delicate affection that its ſcenes had awakened. It was a conſiderable time before her mind was ſufficiently abſtracted from Valancourt to feel the force of his intelligence concerning La Vallee. That Monſ. Queſnel ſhould let it, without even conſulting her on the meaſure, both ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and ſhocked her, particularly as it proved the abſolute au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority he thought himſelf entitled to exerciſe in her affairs. It is true, he had propoſed, before ſhe left France, that the chateau ſhould be let, during her abſence, and to the oeconomical pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this ſhe had nothing to object; but the committing what had been her father's villa to the power and caprice of ſtrangers, and the depriving herſelf of a ſure home, ſhould any unhappy circumſtances make her look back to her home as an aſylum, were conſiderations that made her, even then, ſtrongly oppoſe the meaſure. Her father, too, in his laſt hour, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from her a ſolemn promiſe never to diſpoſe of La Vallee; and this ſhe conſidered as in ſome degree violated if ſhe ſuffered the place to be let. But it was now evident with how little reſpect M. Queſnel had regarded theſe objections, and how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant he conſidered every obſtacle to pecuniary advantage. It appeared, alſo, that he had not even condeſcended to inform Montoni of the ſtep he had taken, ſince no motive was evident for Montoni's concealing the circumſtance from her, if it had been made known to him: this both diſpleaſed and ſurpriſed her; but the chief ſubjects of her uneaſineſs were—the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary diſpoſal of La Vallee, and the diſmiſſion of her father's old and faithful ſervant. "Poor Thereſa," ſaid Emily, "thou hadſt not ſaved much in thy ſervitude, for thou wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     <p>Emily wept bitterly as theſe thoughts paſſed over her mind, and ſhe determined to conſider what could be done for Thereſa, and to talk very explicitly to M. Queſnel on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:029378_0100_0FE0807E05734F38"/>
but ſhe much feared that his cold heart could feel only for itſelf. She determined alſo to inquire whether he had made any mention of her affairs, in his letters to Montoni, who ſoon gave her the opportunity ſhe ſought, by deſiring that ſhe would attend him in his ſtudy. She had little doubt, that the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view was intended for the purpoſe of communicating to her a part of M. Queſnel's letter concerning the tranſactions at La Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee, and ſhe obeyed him immediately. Montoni was alone.</p>
                     <p>"I have juſt been writing to Monſ. Queſnel," ſaid he, when Emily appeared, "in reply to the letter I received from him a few days ago, and I wiſhed to talk to you upon a ſubject that occupied part of it."</p>
                     <p>"I alſo wiſhed to ſpeak with you on this topic, ſir," ſaid Emily.</p>
                     <p>"It is a ſubject of ſome intereſt to you, undoubtedly," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined Montoni, "and I think you muſt ſee it in the light that I do; indeed it will not bear any other. I truſt you will agree with me, that any objection ſounded on ſentiment, as they call it, ought to yield to circumſtances of ſolid advantage."</p>
                     <p>"Granting this, ſir," replied Emily, modeſtly, "thoſe of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity ought ſurely to be attended to. But I fear it is now too late to deliberate upon this plan, and I muſt regret, that it is no longer in my power to reject it."</p>
                     <p>"It is too late," ſaid Montoni, "but ſince it is ſo, I am pleaſed to obſerve, that you ſubmit to reaſon and neceſſity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out indulging uſeleſs complaint. I applaud this conduct exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, the more, perhaps, ſince it diſcovers a ſtrength of mind ſeldom obſervable in your ſex.

                     <p>Montoni ſmiled ſatirically at<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what Emily had written, but did not object to it, and ſhe withdrew to her own apartment, where ſhe ſat down to begin a letter to Valancourt, in which ſhe related the particulars of her journey, and her arrival at Venice deſcribed ſome of the moſt ſtriking ſcenes in the paſſage over the Alps; her emotions on her firſt view of Italy; the manners and characters of the people around her, and ſome few circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Montoni's conduct. But ſhe avoided even naming Count Morano, much more the declaration he had made, ſince ſhe well knew how tremblingly alive to fear is real love, how jealouſly watchful of every circumſtance that may effect its inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; and ſhe ſcrupulouſly avoided to give Valancourt even the ſlighteſt reaſon for believing he had a rival.</p>
                     <p>On the following day Count Morano dined again at Monto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni's. He was in an uncommon flow of ſpirits, and Emily thought there was ſomewhat of exultation in his manner of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing her, which ſhe had never obſerved before. She endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured to repreſs this by more than her uſual reſerve, but the cold civility of her air now ſeemed rather to encourage than to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs him. He appeared watchful of an opportunity of ſpeaking with her alone, and more than once ſolicited this; but Emily always replied, that ſhe could hear nothing from him which he would be unwilling to repeat before the whole company.</p>
                     <p>In the evening, Madame Montoni and her party went out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſea, and as the Count led Emily to his <hi>zendaletto,</hi> he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her hand to his lips and thanked her for the condeſcenſion ſhe had ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Emily in extreme ſurpriſe and diſpleaſure, haſtily withdrew her hand, and concluded that he had ſpoken ironically; but, on reaching the ſteps of the terrace, and obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the livery, that it was the Count's <hi>zendaletto,</hi> which waited below, while the reſt of the party, having arranged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the gondolas, were moving on, ſhe determined not to permit a ſeparate converſation, and, wiſhing him a good evening, returned to the portico. The Count followed to expoſtulate and entreat, and Montoni, who then came out, rendered ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation unneceſſary, for, without condeſcending to ſpeak, he took her hand, and led her to the <hi>zendaletto.</hi> Emily was not

                     <p>"This caprice is intolerable," ſaid he, "and ſhall not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged: here is no impropriety in the caſe."</p>
                     <p>At this moment, Emily's diſlike of Count Morano aroſe to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence. That he ſhould, with undaunted aſſurance, thus pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue her, notwithſtanding all ſhe had expreſſed on the ſubject of his addreſſes, and think, as it was evident he did, that her opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of him was of no conſequence, ſo long as his pretenſions were ſanctioned by Montoni, added indignation to the diſguſt which ſhe had felt towards him. She was ſomewhat relieved by obſerving that Montoni was to be of the party, who ſeated himſelf on one ſide of her, while Morano placed himſelf on the other. There was a pauſe of ſome moments as the gondolieri prepared their oars, and Emily trembled from apprehenſion of the diſcourſe that might follow this ſilence. At length ſhe collected courage to break it herſelf, in the hope of preventing fine ſpeeches from Morano, and reproof from Montoni. To ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> remark which ſhe made, the latter returned a ſhort and diſobliging reply; but Morano immediately followed with a general obſervation, which he contrived to end with a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar compliment, and, though Emily paſſed it without even the notice of a ſmile, he was not diſcouraged.</p>
                     <p>"I have been impatient," ſaid he, addreſſing Emily, "to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs my gratitude; to thank you for your goodneſs; but I muſt alſo thank Signor Montoni, who has allowed me this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of doing ſo."</p>
                     <p>Emily regarded the Count with a look of mingled aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and diſpleaſure.</p>
                     <p>"Why," continued he, "ſhould you wiſh to diminiſh the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of this moment by the air of cruel reſerve?—Why ſeek to throw me again into the perplexities of doubt, by teaching your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"I muſt certainly miſtake you, ſir," ſaid Emily; "my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers on the ſubject have been uniform; it is unworthy of you to accuſe me of caprice.

I myſelf have conſtantly aſſured Count Morano, and you alſo, ſir, that I never can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the honour he offers me, and I now repeat the declaration."</p>
                     <p>The Count looked with an air of ſurpriſe and inquiry at Montoni, whoſe countenance alſo was marked with ſurpriſe, but it was ſurpriſe mingled with indignation.</p>
                     <p>"Here is confidence, as well as caprice?" ſaid the latter. "Will you deny your own words, Madame?"</p>
                     <p>"Such a queſtion is unworthy of an anſwer, ſir;" ſaid E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily "bluſhing; you will recollect yourſelf, and be ſorry that you have aſked it."</p>
                     <p>"Speak to the point," rejoined Montoni, in a voice of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing vehemence. "Will you deny your own words; will you deny that you have acknowledged, only a few hours ago, that it was too late to recede from your engagements, and that you accepted the Count's hand."</p>
                     <p>"I will deny all this, for no words of mine ever imported it."</p>
                     <p>"Aſtoniſhing! Will you deny what you wrote to Monſieur Queſnel, your uncle? if you do, your own hand will bear teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt you. What have you now to ſay?" continued Montoni, obſerving the ſilence and confuſion of Emily.</p>
                     <p>"I now perceive, ſir, that you are under a very great error, and that I have been equally miſtaken."</p>
                     <p>"No more duplicity, I entreat; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"How is this, Signor?" cried Morano, with trembling emotion.</p>

"Excuſe me, ſir, if I withhold my explanation till you appear willing to give me your confidence; aſſertion at preſent can only ſubject me to inſult."</p>

                     <p>"Let me lead to it then, by aſking a queſtion."</p>
                     <p>"As many as you pleaſe," ſaid Montoni, contemptuouſly.</p>
                     <p>"What, then, was the ſubject of your letter to M. Queſnel?"</p>
                     <p>"The ſame that was the ſubject of your note to him, certainly. You did well to ſtipulate for my confidence before you demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that queſtion."</p>
                     <p>"I muſt beg you will be more explicit, ſir; what was that ſubject?"</p>
                     <p>"What could it be, but the noble offer of Count Morano," ſaid Montoni.</p>
                     <p>"Then, ſir, we entirely miſunderdood each other," replied Emily.</p>
                     <p>"We entirely miſunderſtood each other too, I ſuppoſe," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined Montoni, "in the converſation which preceded the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that note? I muſt do you the juſtice to own, that you are very ingenious at this ſame art of miſunderſtanding."</p>
                     <p>Emily tried to reſtrain the tears that came to her eyes, and to anſwer with becoming firmneſs. "Allow me, ſir, to explain myſelf fully, or to be wholly ſilent."</p>
                     <p>"The explanation may now be diſpenſed with; it is antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated. If Count Morano ſtill thinks one neceſſary, I will give him an honeſt one. You have changed your intention ſince our laſt converſation; and, if he can have patience and humility enough to wait till to morrow, he will probably find it changed again: but as I have neither the patience or the humility, which you expect from a lover, I warn you of the effect of my diſpleaſure!"</p>
                     <p>"Montoni, you are too precipitate," ſaid the Count, who had liſtened to this converſation in extreme anxiety and impatience; "Signora, I entreat your own explanation of this affair!"</p>
                     <p>"Signor Montoni has ſaid juſtly," replied Emily, "that all explanation may now be diſpenſed with; after what has paſſed I cannot ſuffer myſelf to give one.

"Offence!" interrupted Montoni—"Count, this language is ridiculous, this ſubmiſſion is childiſh!—ſpeak as becomes a man, not as the ſlave of a petty tyrant." "You diſtract me, Signor; ſuffer me to plead my own cauſe; you have already proved inſufficient to it."</p>
                     <p>"All converſation on this ſubject, ſir," ſaid Emily, "is worſe than uſeleſs, ſince it can bring only pain to each of us: if you would oblige me, purſue it no farther."</p>
                     <p>"It is impoſſible, Madam, that I can thus eaſily reſign the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of a paſſion, which is the delight and torment of my life.—I muſt ſtill love—ſtill purſue you with unremitting ardour;—when you ſhall be convinced of the ſtrength and conſtancy of my paſſion, your heart muſt ſoften into pity and repentance."</p>
                     <p>"Is this generous, ſir? is this manly? Can it either deſerve or obtain the eſteem you ſolicit, thus to continue a perſecution from which I have no preſent means of eſcaping?"</p>
                     <p>A gleam of moonlight that fell upon Morano's countenance, revealed the ſtrong emotions of his ſoul; and, glancing on Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni diſcovered the dark reſentment, which contraſted his features.</p>
                     <p>"By heaven this is too much!" ſuddenly exclaimed the Count; "Signor Montoni, you treat me ill; it is from you that I ſhall look for explanation."</p>
                     <p>"From me, ſir! you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

And for you, Madam, you ſhould learn, that a man of honour is not to be trifled with, though you may, perhaps, with impunity, treat a <hi>boy</hi> like a puppet."</p>
                     <p>This ſarcaſm rouſed the pride of Morano, and the reſentment which he had felt at the indifference of Emily, being loſt in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of the inſolence of Montoni, he determined to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify him, by defending her.</p>
                     <p>"This alſo," ſaid he, replying to Montoni's laſt words, "this alſo, ſhall not paſs unnoticed. I bid you learn, ſir, that you have a ſtronger enemy than a woman to contend with: I will protect Signora St. Aubert from your threatened reſentment. You have miſled me, and would revenge your diſappointed views upon the innocent."</p>
                     <p>"Miſled you!" retorted Montoni with quickneſs, "is my conduct—my word"—then pauſing while he ſeemed endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to reſtrain the reſentment, that flaſhed in his eyes, in the next moment he added, in a ſubdued voice, "Count Morano this is a language, a ſort of conduct to which I am not accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed:
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:029378_0103_0FE0809110A9CAF8"/>
it is the conduct of a paſſionate boy—as ſuch, I paſs it over in contempt."</p>
                     <p>"In contempt, Signor?"</p>
                     <p>"The reſpect I owe myſelf," rejoined Montoni, "requires, that I ſhould converſe more largely with you upon ſome points of the ſubject in diſpute. Return with me to Venice, and I will condeſcend to convince you of your error."</p>
                     <p>"Condeſcend, ſir! but I will not condeſcend to be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with."</p>
                     <p>Montoni ſmiled contemptuouſly; and Emily, now terrified for the conſequences of what ſhe ſaw and heard, could no longer be ſilent. She explained the whole ſubject upon which ſhe had miſtaken Montoni in the morning, declaring, that ſhe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood him to have conſulted her ſolely concerning the diſpoſal of La Vallee, and concluding with entreating, that he would write immediately to M. Queſnel, and rectify the miſtake.</p>
                     <p>But Montoni either was, or affected to be, ſtill incredulous: and Count Morano was ſtill entangled in perplexity. While ſhe was ſpeaking, however, the attention of her auditors had been diverted from the immediate occaſion of their reſentment, and their paſſion conſequently became leſs. Montoni deſired the Count would order his ſervants to row back to Venice, that he might have ſome private converſation with him; and Morano, ſomewhat ſoothed by his ſoftened voice and manner, and eager to examine into the full extent of his difficulties complied.</p>
                     <p>Emily, comforted by this proſpect of releaſe, employed the preſent moments in endeavouring, with conciliating care, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any fatal miſchief between the perſons who ſo lately had perſecuted and inſulted her.</p>
                     <p>Her ſpirits revived, when ſhe heard once more the voice of ſong and laughter, reſounding from the grand canal, and at length entered again between its ſtately piazzas. The <hi>zendaletto</hi> ſtopped at Montoni's manſion, and the Count haſtily led her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hall, where Montoni took his arm, and ſaid ſomething in a low voice, on which Morano kiſſed the hand he held, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding Emily's effort to diſengage it, and wiſhing her a good evening, with an accent and look ſhe could not miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, returned to his <hi>zendaletto</hi> with Montoni.</p>
                     <p>Emily, in her own apartment, conſidered with intenſe anxiety all the unjuſt and tyrannical conduct of Montoni, the dauntleſs perſeverance of Morano, and her own deſolate ſituation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from her friends and country. She looked in vain to Valancourt, confined by his profeſſion to a diſtant kingdom, as

her protector; but it gave her comfort to know, that there was, at leaſt, one perſon in the world, who would ſympathize in her afflictions, and whoſe wiſhes would fly eagerly to releaſe her. Yet ſhe determined not to give him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> pain by relating the reaſons ſhe had to regret the having rejected his better judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning Montoni; reaſons, however, which could not induce her to lament the delicacy and diſintereſted affection that had made her reject his propoſal for a clandeſtine marriage. The approaching interview with her uncle ſhe regarded with ſome degree of hope, for ſhe determined to repreſent to him the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes of her ſituation, and to entreat that he would allow her to return to France with him and Madame Queſnel. Then, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly remembering that her beloved La Vallee, her only home was no longer at her command, her tears flowed anew, and ſhe feared that ſhe had little pity to expect from a man who, like M. Queſnel, could diſpoſe of it without deigning to conſult with her, and could diſmiſs an aged and faithful ſervant, deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of either ſupport or aſylum. But, though it was certain, that ſhe had herſelf no longer a home in France, and few, very few friends there, ſhe determined to return, if poſſible, that ſhe might be releaſed from the power of Montoni, whoſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly oppreſſive conduct towards herſelf, and general character as to others, were juſtly terrible to her imagination. She had no wiſh to reſide with her uncle, M. Queſnel, ſince his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to her late father and to herſelf, had been uniformly ſuch as to convince her, that in flying to him ſhe could only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an exchange of oppreſſors; neither had ſhe the ſlighteſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of conſenting to the propoſal of Valancourt for an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate marriage, though this would give her a lawful and a generous protector, for the chief reaſons, which had formerly influenced her conduct, ſtill exiſted againſt it, while others, which ſeemed to juſtify the ſtep, would now be done away; and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, his fame were at all times too dear to her, to ſuffer her to conſent to a union, which, at this early period of their lives, would probably defeat both. One ſure, and proper aſylum, however, would ſtill be open to her in France. She knew that ſhe could board in the convent; where ſhe had formerly expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced ſo much kindneſs, and which had an affecting and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn claim upon her heart, ſince it contained the remains of her late father. Here ſhe could remain in ſafety and tranquillity, till the term, for which La Vallee might be let ſhould expire; or, till the arrangement of M. Motteville's affairs enabled her ſo far to eſtimate the remains of her fortune, as to judge whether it would be prudent for her to reſide there.</p>

Concerning Montoni's conduct with reſpect to his letters to M. Queſnel, ſhe had many doubts; however he might be at firſt miſtaken on the ſubject, ſhe much ſuſpected that he wilfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevered in his error, as a means of intimidating her into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with his wiſhes of uniting her to Count Morano. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this was or was not the fact, ſhe was extremely anxious to explain the affair to M. Queſnel, and looked forward with a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of impatience, hope and fear, to her approaching viſit.</p>
                     <p>On the following day, Madame Montoni, being alone with Emily, introduced the mention of Count Morano, by expreſſing her ſurpriſe, that ſhe had not joined the party on the water the preceding evening, and at her abrupt departure to Venice. Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily then related what had paſſed, expreſſed her concern for the mutual miſtake that had occured between Montoni and herſelf, and ſolicited her aunt's kind offices in urging him to give a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive denial to the Count's further addreſſes; but ſhe ſoon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that Madame Montoni had not been ignorant of the late converſation, when ſhe introduced the preſent.</p>
                     <p>"You have no encouragement to expect from me," ſaid her aunt, "in theſe notions. I have already given my opinion on the ſubject, and think Signor Montoni right in enforcing, by any means, your conſent. If young perſons will ye blind to their intereſt, and obſtinately oppoſe it, why, the greateſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings they can have are friends, who will oppoſe their folly. Pray what pretenſions of any kind do you think you have to ſuch a match as is now offered you."</p>
                     <p>"Not any whatever, Madam," replied Emily, "and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, at leaſt, ſuffer me to be happy in my humility."</p>
                     <p>"Nay, niece, it cannot be denied, that you have pride enough; my poor brother, your father, had his ſhare of pride too; though, let me add, his fortune did not juſtify it."</p>
                     <p>Emily, ſomewhat embarraſſed by the indignation, which this malevolent alluſion to her father excited, and by the difficulty of rendering her anſwer as temperate as it ſhould be reprehenſive, heſitated for ſome moments, in a confuſion, which highly grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied her aunt. At length ſhe ſaid, "My father's pride, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam had a noble object—the happineſs which he knew could be derived only from goodneſs, knowledge and charity. As <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

He never diſdained thoſe who were wretched by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and misfortune; he did ſometimes deſpiſe perſons, who, with many opportunities of happineſs, rendered themſelves miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:029378_0105_0FE080A1F0519D18"/>
by vanity, ignorance and cruelty. I ſhall think it my higheſt glory to emulate ſuch pride."</p>
                     <p>"I do not pretend to underſtand any thing of theſe high flown ſentiments, niece; you have all that glory to yourſelf: I would teach you a little plain ſenſe, and not have you ſo wiſe as to deſpiſe happineſs."</p>
                     <p>"That would indeed not be wiſdom, but folly," ſaid Emily, "for wiſdom can boaſt no higher attainment than happineſs; but you will allow, Madam, that our ideas of happineſs may differ. I cannot doubt, that you wiſh me to be happy, but I muſt fear you are miſtaken in the means of making me ſo."</p>
                     <p>"I cannot boaſt of a learned education, niece, ſuch as your father thought proper to give you, and, therefore, do not pretend to underſtand all theſe fine ſpeeches about happineſs. I muſt be contented to underſtand only common ſenſe, and happy would it have been for you and your father, if that had been included in his education."</p>
                     <p>Emily was too much ſhocked by theſe reflections on her fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's memory, to deſpiſe this ſpeech as it deſerved.</p>
                     <p>Madame Montoni was about to ſpeak, but Emily quitted the room, and retired to her own, where the little ſpirit ſhe had lately exerted yielded to grief and vexation, and left her only to her tears. From every review of her ſituation ſhe could derive, indeed, only new ſorrow. To the diſcovery, which had juſt been forced upon her, of Montoni's unworthineſs, ſhe had now to add, that of the cruel vanity, for the gratification of which her aunt was about to ſacrifice her; of the effrontery and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, with which, at the time that ſhe meditated the ſacrifice, ſhe boaſted of her tenderneſs, or inſulted her victim; and of the venomous envy, which, as it did not ſcruple to attack her father's character, could ſcarcely be expected to withhold from her own.</p>
                     <p>During the few days, that intervened between this converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the departure for Miarenti, Montoni did not once ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs himſelf to Emily. His looks ſufficiently declared his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment; but that he ſhould forbear to renew a mention of the ſubject of it, exceedingly ſurpriſed her, who was no leſs aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed, that during three days, Count Morano neither viſited Montoni, or was named by him. Several conjectures aroſe in her mind. Sometimes ſhe feared that the diſpute between them had been revived, and had ended fatally to the Count. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhe was inclined to hope, that wearineſs, or diſguſt at her firm rejection of his ſuit had induced him to relinquiſh it; and,
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:029378_0105_0FE080A1F0519D18"/>
at others, ſhe ſuſpected that he had now recourſe to ſtratagem, and forbore his viſits, and prevailed with Montoni to forbear the repetition of his name, in the expectation that gratitude and generoſity would prevail with her to give him the conſent, which he could not hope from love.</p>
                     <p>Thus paſſed the time in vain conjecture, and alternate hopes and fears, till the day arrived when Montoni was to ſet out for the villa of Miarenti, which, like the preceding ones, neither brought the Count or the mention of him.</p>
                     <p>Montoni having determined not to leave Venice, till towards evening, that he might avoid the heats, and catch the cool breezes of night, embarked about an hour before ſunſet, with his family, in a barge for the Brenta. Emily ſat alone near the ſtern of the veſſel, and, as it floated ſlowly on, watched the gay and lofty city leſſening from her view, till its palaces ſeemed to ſink in the diſtant waves, while its loftier towers and domes, illumined by the declining ſun, appeared on the horizon, like thoſe far-ſeen clouds which, in more northern climes, often linger on the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern verge, and catch the laſt light of a ſummer's evening. Soon after, even theſe grew dim, and faded in diſtance from her ſight; but ſhe ſtill ſat gazing on the vaſt ſcene of cloudleſs ſky, and mighty waters, and liſtening in pleaſing awe to the deep-ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing waves, while as her eyes glanced over the Adriatic, towards the oppoſite ſhores, which were, however, far beyond the reach of ſight, ſhe thought of Greece, and a thouſand claſſical remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances ſtealing to her mind, ſhe experienced that penſive luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which is felt on viewing the ſcenes of ancient ſtory, and on comparing their preſent ſtate of ſilence and ſolitude with that of their former grandeur and animation. The ſcenes of the Illiad illapſed in glowing colours to her fancy—ſcenes, once the haunt of heroes—now lonely, and in ruins; but which ſtill ſhone, in the poet's ſtrain, in all their youthful ſplendour.</p>
                     <p>As her imagination painted with melancholy touches, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted plains of Troy, ſuch as they appeared in this after-day, ſhe re-animated the landſcape with the following little ſtory.</p>

                     <p>As Emily approached the ſhores of Italy ſhe began to diſcrim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inate the rich features and varied colouring of the landſcape. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The noble Brenta, pouring its broad waves into the ſea, now appeared, and, when ſhe reached its mouth, the barge ſtopped, that the horſes might be faſtened which were to tow it up the ſtream. This done, Emily gave a laſt look to the Adriatic, and to the dim ſail,

                        </q>
and the barge ſlowly glided between the green and luxuriant ſlopes of the river. The grandeur of the Palladian villas, that adorn theſe ſhores, was conſiderably heightened by the ſetting
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:029378_0107_0FE080B1C91A3728"/>
rays, which threw ſtrong contraſts of light and ſhade upon the porticos and long arcades, and beamed a mellow luſtre upon the orangeries and the tall groves of pine and eypreſs, that overhung the building. The ſcent of orange <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>The ſun now ſunk below the horizon, twilight fell over the landſcape, and Emily, wrapt in muſing ſilence, continued to watch its features gradually vaniſhing into obſcurity. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered her many happy evenings, when with St. Aubert ſhe had obſerved the ſhades of twilight ſteal over a ſcene as beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as this, from the gardens of La Vallee, and a tear fell to the memory of her father.

                        </gap>hat ſhe had taken leave of him for ever, and that the countries, which ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated them, would never more be retraced by her. She look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Count Morano with horror, as in ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                        </gap> this; but apart from him, a conviction, if ſuch that may be called, which ariſes from no proof, and which ſhe knew not how to account for, ſeized her mind—that ſhe ſhould never ſee Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt again. Though ſhe knew, that neither Morano's ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation, nor Montoni's commands had lawful power to enforce her obedience, ſhe regarded both with a ſuperſtitious dread, that they would finally prevail.</p>
                     <p>Loſt in this melancholy reverie, and ſhedding frequent tears, Emily was at length rouſed by Montoni, and ſhe followed him to the cabin, where refreſhments were ſpread, and her aunt was ſeated alone. The countenance of Madame Montoni was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with reſentment that appeared to be the conſequence of ſome converſation ſhe had held with her huſband, who regarded her with a kind of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> diſtain, and both preſerved, for ſome time, a haughty ſilence. Montoni then ſpoke to Emily of Monſ. Queſnel: "You will not, I hope, perſiſt in diſclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your knowledge of the ſubject in my letter to him?"</p>
                     <p>"I had hoped, ſir, that it was no longer neceſſary for me to diſclaim it," ſaid Emily, "I had hoped, from your ſilence, that you was convinced of your error."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="213" facs="unknown:029378_0107_0FE080B1C91A3728"/>
"You have hoped impoſſibilities then," replied Montoni; "I might as reaſonably have expected to find ſincerity and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of conduct in one of your ſex, as you to convict me of error in this affair."</p>
                     <p>Emily bluſhed and was ſilent; ſhe now perceived too clearly, that ſhe had hoped an impoſſibility, for, where no miſtake had been committed no conviction could follow; and it was evident, that Montoni's conduct had not been the conſequence of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, but of deſign.</p>
                     <p>Anxious to eſcape from converſation, which was both afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and humiliating to her, ſhe ſoon returned to the deck, and reſumed her ſtation near the ſtern, without apprehenſion of cold, for no vapour roſe from the water, and the air was dry and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quil; here, at leaſt, the benevolence of nature allowed her the quiet which Montoni had denied her elſewhere. It was now paſt midnight. The ſtars ſhed a kind of twilight, that ſerved to ſhew the dark outline of the ſhores on either hand, and the gray ſurface of the river; till the moon roſe from behind a high palm grove, and ſhed her mellow luſtre over the ſcene. The veſſel glided ſmoothly on: amid the ſtillneſs of the hour Emily heard, now and then, the ſolitary voice of the bargemen on the bank, as they ſpoke to their horſes: while, from a remote part of the veſſel, with melancholy ſong,
<q>
                           <l>—"The ſailor ſooth'd,</l>

                     <p>Emily, meanwhile anticipated her reception by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> and Madame Queſnel; conſidered what ſhe ſhould ſay on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of La Vallee; and then, to withhold her mind from more anxious topics, tried to amuſe herſelf by diſcriminating the faint-drawn features of the landſcape repoſing the moonlight. While her fancy thus wandered, ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>The barge ſtopped at a flight of marble ſteps, which led up the bank to a lawn. Lights appeared between ſome pillars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the portico. Montoni ſent forward his ſervant, and then diſembarked with his family. They found Monſ. and Madame Queſnel, with a few friends, ſeated on ſofas in the portico, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the cool breeze of the night, and eating fruits and ices, while ſome of their ſervants at a little diſtance; on the river's
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:029378_0108_0FE080C0E45A36A0"/>
bank, were performing a ſimple ſerenade. Emily was now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to the way of living in this warm country, and was not ſurpriſed to find Monſ. and Madame Queſnel in their porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, two hours after midnight.</p>
                     <p>The uſual ſalutations being over, the company ſeated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the portico, and refreſhments were brought them from the adjoining hall, were a banquet was ſpread, and ſervants at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. When the buſtle of this meeting had ſubſided, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily had recovered from the little flutter into which it, had thrown her ſpirits, ſhe was ſtruck with the ſingular beauty of the hall, ſo perfectly accommodated to the luxuries of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. It was of white marble, and the roof, riſing into an open eupola, was ſupported by columns of the ſame material. Two oppoſite ſides of the apartment, terminating in open porticos, admitted to the hall a full view of the gardens, and of the river ſcenery; in the centre a fountain continually refreſhed the air, and ſeemed to heighten the fragrance, that breathed from the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding orangeries, whilſt its daſhing waters gave an agreeable and ſoothing ſound. Etruſcan lamps, ſuſpended from the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, diffuſed a brilliant light over the interior part of the hall, leaving the remoter porticos to the ſofter luſtre of the moon.</p>
                     <p>Monſ. Queſnel talked apart to Montoni of his own affairs, in his uſual ſtrain of ſelf-importance; boaſted of his new acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and then affected to pity ſome diſappointments, which Montoni had lately ſuſtained. Meanwhile, the latter, whoſe pride at leaſt enabled him to deſpiſe ſuch vanity as this, and whoſe diſcernment at once detected under this aſſumed pity, the frivolous malignity of Queſnel's mind, liſtened to him in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous ſilence, till he named his niece, and then they left the portico, and walked away into the gardens.</p>
                     <p>Emily, however, ſtill atte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

That country, too, was inhabited by Valancourt, and ſhe liſtened to the mention of it, with a faint hope, that he alſo would be named. Madame Queſnel, who, when ſhe was in France, had talked with rapture of Italy, now, that ſhe was in Italy, talked with equal praiſe of France, and endeavoured to excite the wonder and envy of her auditors by accounts of places, which they had not been happy enough to ſee. In theſe deſcriptions ſhe not only impoſed upon them, but upon herſelf, for ſhe never thought a preſent pleaſure equal to one that was paſſed; and thus the delicious climate, the fragrant
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:029378_0108_0FE080C0E45A36A0"/>
orangeries and all the luxuries, which ſurrounded her, ſlept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noticed, while her fancy wandered over the diſtant ſcenes of a nothern country.</p>
                     <p>Emily liſtened in vain for the name of Valancourt. Madame Montoni ſpoke in her turn of the delights of Venice, and of the pleaſure ſhe expected from viſiting the fine caſtle of Montoni, on the Appennine; which latter mention, at leaſt, was merely a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliating boaſt, for Emily well knew, that her aunt had no taſte for ſolitary grandeur, and, particularly, for ſuch as the caſtle of Udolpho promiſed. Thus the party continued to converſe, and, as far as civility would permit, to torter each other by mutual boaſts, while they reclined on ſofas in the portico and were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virond with delights both from nature and art, by which any honeſt minds would have been tempered to benevolence, and happy imaginations would have been ſoothed into enchantment.</p>
                     <p>The dawn, ſoon after, trembled in the eaſtern horizon, and the light tints of morning gradually expanding, ſhewed the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully declining forms of the Italian mountains and the gleam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing landſcapes, ſtretched at their feet. Then the ſunbeams, ſhooting up from behind the hills, ſpread over the ſcene that fine ſaffron tinge, which ſeems <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> glowing colours were revealed, except that its remoter features were ſtill ſoftened and united in the miſt of diſtance, whoſe ſweet effect was heightened to Emily by the dark verdure of the pines and cypreſſes, that overarched the foreground of the river.</p>
                     <p>The market people, paſſing with their boats to Venice, now formed; moving picture on the Brenta. Moſt of theſe had lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle painted awnings, to ſhelter their owners from the ſunbeams, which, together with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> of fruit and flowers, diſplayed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, and the taſteful ſimplicity of the peaſant girls, who watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the rural treaſures, rendered them gay and ſtriking objects. The ſwift movement of the boats down the current, the quick glance of oars in the water, and now and then the paſſing cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus of peaſants, who reclined under the ſail of their little bark, or the tones of ſome ruſtic inſtrument, played by a girl, as ſhe ſat near her ſylvan cargo, heightened the animation and feſtivity of the ſcene.</p>
                     <p>When Montoni and M. Queſnel had joined the ladies, the party left the portico for the gardens, where the charming ſcenery ſoon withdrew Emily's thoughts from painful ſubjects. The majeſtic forms and rich verdure of cypreſſes ſhe had never ſeen ſo perfect before: groves of cedar, lemon, and orange, the ſpiry
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:029378_0109_0FE080C5ACA84810"/>
cluſters of the pine and poplar, the luxuriant cheſnut and oriental plane, threw all their pomp of ſhade over theſe gardens; while bowers of flowering myrtle and other ſpicy ſhrubs mingled their fragrance with that of flowers, whoſe vivid and various colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glowed with increaſed effect beneath the contraſted umbrage of the groves. The air alſo was continually refreſhed by rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, which, with more taſte than faſhion, had been ſuffered to wander among the green receſſes.</p>
                     <p>Emily often lingered behind the party, to contemplate the diſtant landſcape, that cloſed a viſta, or that gleamed beneath the dark foliage of the foreground;—the ſpiral ſummits of the mountains, touched with a purple tint, broken and ſteep above, but ſhelving gradually to their baſe; the open valley, marked by no formal lines of art; and the tall groves of cypreſs, pine and poplar, ſometimes embelliſhed by a ruined villa, whoſe broken columns appeared between the branches of a pine, that ſeemed to droop over their fall.</p>
                     <p>From other parts of the gardens, the character of the view was entirely changed, and the fine ſolitary beauty of the landſcape ſhifted for the crowded features and varied colouring of inhabita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>The ſun was now gaining faſt upon the ſky, and the party quitted the gardens, and retired to repoſe.</p>

                     <p>EMILY ſeized the firſt opportunity of converſing alone with Monſ. Queſnel, concerning La Vallee. His anſwers to her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries were conciſe, and delivered with the air of a man, who is conſcious of poſſeſſing abſolute power and impatient of hearing it queſtioned. He declared, that the diſpoſal of the place was a neceſſary meaſure; and that ſhe might conſider herſelf indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his prudence for even the ſmall income that remained for her. "But, however," added he, "when this Venetian Count (I have forgot his name) marries you, your preſent diſagreeable ſtate of dependence will ceaſe. As a relation to you I rejoice in the circumſtance, which is ſo fortunate for you, and I may add, ſo unexpected by your friends."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="217" facs="unknown:029378_0109_0FE080C5ACA84810"/>
For ſome moments Emily was chilled into ſilence by this ſpeech; and, when ſhe attempted to undeceive him, concerning the purport of the note ſhe had incloſed in Montoni's letter, he appeared to have ſome private reaſon for diſbelieving her aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and, for a conſiderable time, perſevered in accuſing her of capricious conduct. Being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at length, however, convinced, that ſhe really diſliked Morano and had poſitively rejected his ſuit, his reſentment was extravagant, and he expreſſed it in terms equally pointed and inhuman; for, ſecretly flattered by the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of a connection with a nobleman, whoſe title he had affected to forget, he was incapable of feeling pity for whatever ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his niece might ſtand in the way of his ambition.</p>
                     <p>Emily ſaw at once in his manner all the difficulties, that await<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, and, though no oppreſſion could have power to make her renounce Valancourt for Morano, her fortitude now trembled at an encounter with the violent paſſions of her uncle.</p>
                     <p>She oppoſed his turbulence and indignation only by the mild dignity of a ſuperior mind; but the gentle firmneſs of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct ſerved to exaſperate ſtill more his reſentment, ſince it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled him to feel his own inferiority, and, when he left her, he declared, that, if ſhe perſiſted in her folly, both himſelf and Montoni would abandon her to the contempt of the world.</p>
                     <p>The calmneſs ſhe had aſſumed in his preſence failed Emily, when alone, and ſhe wept bitterly, and called frequently upon the name of her departed father, whoſe advice to her from his death bed ſhe then remembered. "Alas!" ſaid ſhe, "I do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed perceive how much more valuable is the ſtrength of forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude than the grace of ſenſibility, and I will alſo endeavour to fulfil the promiſe I then made; I will not indulge in unavailing lamentation, but will try to endure, with firmneſs, the oppreſſion I cannot elude."</p>
                     <p>Somewhat ſoothed by the conſciouſneſs of performing a part of St. Aubert's laſt requeſt, and of endeavouring to purſue the conduct which he would have approved, ſhe overcame her tears, and, when the company met at dinner, had recovered her uſual ſerenity of countenance.</p>

looked at the ſnow-capt Apennines, aſcending in the diſtance, thought of Montoni's caſtle, and ſuffered ſome terror, leſt he ſhould convey her thither, for the purpoſe of enforcing her obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; but the thought vaniſhed, when ſhe conſidered, that ſhe was as much in his power at Venice as ſhe could be elſewhere.</p>
                     <p>It was moonlight before the party returned to the villa, where ſupper was ſpread in the airy hall, which had ſo much enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Emily's fancy, on the preceding night.

His compliments ſhe received in ſilence, and her cold air ſeemed at firſt to diſcompoſe him; but he ſoon recovered his uſual gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of manner, though the officious kindneſs of M. and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame Queſnel, Emily perceived diſguſted him. Such a degree of attention ſhe had ſcarcely believed could be ſhewn by M. Queſnel, for ſhe had never before ſeen him otherwiſe than in the preſence of his inferiors or equals.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe could retire to her own apartment, her mind almoſt involuntarily dwelt on the moſt probable means of prevailing with the Count to withdraw his ſuit, and to her liberal mind none appeared more probable, than that of acknowledging to him a prior attachment and throwing herſelf upon his genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity for a releaſe. When, however, on the following day, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed his addreſſes, ſhe ſhrunk from the adoption of the plan ſhe had formed. There was ſomething ſo repugnant to her juſt pride, in laying open the ſecret of her heart to ſuch a man as Morano, and in ſuing to him for compaſſion, that ſhe impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently rejected this deſign and wondered, that ſhe could have pauſed upon it for a moment. The rejection of his ſuit ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated in the moſt deciſive terms ſhe could ſelect, mingling with it a ſevere cenſure of his conduct; but, though the Count ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared mortified by this, he perſevered in the moſt ardent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of admiration, till he was interrupted and Emily releaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the preſence of Madame Queſnel.</p>
                     <p>During her ſtay at this pleaſant villa, Emily was thus render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed miſerable by the aſſiduities of Morano, together with the cruelly exerted authority of M. Queſnel and Montoni, who, with her aunt, ſeemed now more reſolutely determined upon this marriage than they had even appeared to be at Venice. M.

Queſnel, finding that both argument and menace were ineffectual in enforcing an immediate concluſion to it, at length relinquiſhed his endeavours, and truſted to the power of Montoni and to the courſe of events at Venice. Emily, indeed, looked to Venice with hope, for there ſhe would be relieved in ſome meaſure from the perſecution of Morano, who would no longer be an inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of the ſame houſe with herſelf, and from that of Montoni, whoſe engagements would not permit him to be continually at home. But amidſt the preſſure of her own misfortunes, ſhe did not forget thoſe of poor Thereſa, for whom ſhe pleaded with courageous tenderneſs to Queſnel, who promiſed, in ſlight and general terms, that ſhe ſhould not be forgotten.</p>
                     <p>Montoni, in a long converſation with M. Queſnel, arranged the plan to be purſued reſpecting Emily, and M. Queſnel propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be at Venice, as ſoon as he ſhould be informed, that the nuptials were concluded.</p>
                     <p>It was new to Emily to part with any perſon, with whom ſhe was connected, without feelings of regret; the moment, however, in which ſhe took leave of M. and Madame Queſnel, was, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, the only ſatisfactory one ſhe had known in their preſence.</p>
                     <p>Morano returned in Montoni's barge, and Emily, as ſhe watched her gradual approach to that magic city, ſaw at her ſide the only perſon, who occaſioned her to view it with leſs than perfect delight. They arrived there about midnight, when Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily was releaſed from the preſence of the Count, who, with Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni, went to a Caſino, and ſhe was ſuffered to retire to her own apartment.</p>
                     <p>On the following day, Montoni in a ſhort converſation, which he held with Emily, informed her, that he would no longer be <hi>trifled</hi> with, and that, ſince her marriage with the Count would be ſo highly advantageous to her, that folly only could object to at, and folly of ſuch extent as was incapable of conviction, it ſhould be celebrated without further delay, and if that was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, without her conſent.</p>
                     <p>Emily, who had hitherto tried remonſtrance, had now recourſe to ſupplication, for diſtreſs prevented her from foreſeeing, that with a man of Montoni's diſpoſition, ſupplication would be equally uſeleſs. She afterwards inquired by what right he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted this unlimited authority over her? a queſtion, which her better judgment would have withheld her, in a calmer moment, from making, ſince it could avail her nothing, and would afford Montoni another opportunity of triumphing over her defenceleſs condition.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="220" facs="unknown:029378_0111_0FE080D5BB64DD50"/>
"By what right!" cried Montoni, with a malicious ſmile, "by the right of my will; if you can elude that, I will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">
                           <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>

                     <p>Emily continued, for ſometime after Montoni had left her, in a ſtate of deſpair, or rather of ſtupefaction; a conſciouſneſs of miſery was all that remained in her mind. In this ſituation Madame Montoni <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ound her, at the ſound of whoſe voice Emily looked up, and her aunt, ſomewhat ſoftened by the expreſſion of deſpair, that fixed her countenance, ſpoke in a manner more kind than ſhe had ever yet done. Emily's heart was touched; ſhe ſhed tears, and, after weeping for ſometime, recovered ſufficient compoſure to ſpeak on the ſubject of her diſtreſs, and to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to intereſt Madame Montoni in her behalf. But, though the compaſſion of her aunt had been ſurpriſed, her ambition was not to be overcome, and her preſent object was to be the aunt of a Counteſs. Emily's efforts, therefore, were as unſucceſsful as they had been with Montoni, and ſhe withdrew to her apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to think and weep alone. How often did ſhe remember the parting ſcene with Valancourt, and wiſh, that the Italian had mentioned Montoni's character with leſs reſerve! When her mind, however, had recovered from the firſt ſhock of this beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, ſhe conſidered, that it would be impoſſible for him to compel her alliance with Morano, if ſhe perſiſted in refuſing to repeat any part of the marriage ceremony; and ſhe perſevered in her reſolution to await Montoni's threatened vengeance rather than give herſelf for life to a man, whom ſhe muſt have deſpiſed for his preſent conduct, had ſhe never even loved Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court: yet ſhe trembled at the revenge ſhe thus reſolved to brave.</p>
                     <p>An affair, however, ſoon after occurred, which ſomewhat cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led off Montoni's attention from Emily. The myſterious viſits of Orſino were renewed with more frequency ſince the return of the former to Venice. There were others, alſo, beſides Orſino, admitted to theſe midnight councils, and among them Cavigni and Verezzi. Montoni became more reſerved and auſtere in his manner than ever; and Emily, if her own intereſts had not made her regardleſs of his, might have perceived, that ſomething extraordinary was working in his mind.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="221" facs="unknown:029378_0111_0FE080D5BB64DD50"/>
One night, on which a council was not held, Orſino came in great agitation of ſpirits, and diſpatched his confidential ſervant to Montoni, who was at a Caſino, deſiring that he would return home immediately; but charging the ſervant not to mention his name. Montoni obeyed the ſummons, and, on meeting Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſino, was informed of the circumſtances, that occaſioned his viſit and his viſible alarm, with a part of which he was already ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted.</p>
                     <p>A Venetian nobleman, who had, on ſome late occaſion, provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the hatred of Orſino, had been way-laid and poniarded by hired aſſaſſins: and, as the murdered perſon was of the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections, the Senate had taken up the affair. One of the aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins was now apprehended, who had confeſſed, that Orſino was his employer in the attrocious deed; and the latter informed of his danger, had now come to Montoni to conſult on the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures neceſſary to favour his eſcape. He knew, that at this time, the officers of the police were upon the watch for him, all over the city; to leave it at preſent, therefore was impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and Montoni conſented to ſecrete him for a few days till the vigilance of juſtice ſhould relax, and then to aſſiſt him in quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Venice. He knew the danger he himſelf incurred by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Orſino to remain in his houſe, but ſuch was the nature of his obligations to this man, that he did not think it prudent to refuſe him an aſylum.</p>
                     <p>Such was the perſon whom Montoni had admitted to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and for whom he felt as much friendſhip as was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with his character.</p>
                     <p>While Orſino remained concealed in his houſe, Montoni was unwilling to attract public obſervation by the nuptials of Count Morano; but this obſtacle was, in a few days, overcome by the departure of his criminal viſitor, and he then informed Emily, that her marriage was to be celebrated on the following morning. To her repeated aſſurances, that it ſhould not take place, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied only by a malignant ſmile; and telling her, that the Count and a prieſt would be at his houſe early in the morning, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed her no further to dare his reſentment, by oppoſition to his will and to her own intereſt. "I am now going out for the evening," ſaid he, "remember, that I ſhall give your hand to Count Morano in the morning." Emily, having, ever ſince his late threats, expected, that her trials would at length arrive to this criſis, was leſs ſhocked by the declaration, than ſhe otherwiſe would have been, and ſhe endeavoured to ſupport herſelf by the belief, that the marriage could not be valid, ſo long as ſhe refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:029378_0112_0FE080E4938B3838"/>
before the prieſt to repeat any part of the ceremony. Yet, as the moment of trial approached, her long haraſſed ſpirits ſhrunk almoſt equally from the encounter of his vengeance, and from the hand of Count Morano. She was not even perfectly certain of the conſequence of her ſteady refuſal at the alter, and ſhe trembled, more than ever, at the power of Montoni, which ſeemed unlimited as his will, for ſhe ſaw, that he would not ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to tranſgreſs any law, if, by ſo doing, he could accompliſh his project.</p>
                     <p>While her mind was thus ſuffering and in a ſtate little ſhort of diſtraction, ſhe was informed that Morano aſked permiſſion to ſee her, and the ſervant had ſcarcely departed with an excuſe, before ſhe repented that ſhe had ſent one. In the next moment, reverting to her former deſign, and determining to try, whether reverting to her former deſign, and determining to try, whether expoſtulation and entreaty would not ſucceed, where a refuſal and a juſt diſdain had failed, ſhe recalled the ſervant, and, ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a different meſſage, prepared to go down to the Count.</p>
                     <p>The dignity and aſſumed compoſure with which ſhe met him, and the kind of penſive reſignation, that ſoftened her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance were circumſtances not likely to induce him to relinquiſh her, ſerving, as they did, to heighten a paſſion, which had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready intoxicated his judgment. He liſtened to all ſhe ſaid with an appearance of complacency and of a wiſh to oblige her; but his reſolution remained invariably the ſame, and he endeavoured to win her admiration by every inſinuating art he ſo well knew how to practiſe. Being, at length, aſſured, that ſhe had nothing to hope from his juſtice, ſhe repeated, in a ſolemn and impreſſive manner, her abſolute rejection of his ſuit, and quitted him with an aſſurance, that her refuſal would be effectually maintained againſt every circumſtance, that could be imagined for ſubduing it. A juſt pride had reſtrained her tears in his preſence, but now they flowed from the fulneſs of her heart. She often called upon the name of her late father, and often dwelt with unutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able anguiſh on the idea of Valancourt.</p>
                     <p>She did not go down to ſupper, but remained alone in her apartment, ſometimes yielding to the influence of grief and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and, at others, endeavouring to fortify her mind againſt them, and to prepare herſelf to meet, with compoſed courage, the ſcene of the following morning, when all the ſtratagem of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rano and the violence of Montoni would be united againſt her.</p>
                     <p>The evening was far advanced, when Madame Montoni came to her chamber with ſome bridal ornaments, which the Count had ſent to Emily. She had, this day, purpoſely avoided her
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:029378_0112_0FE080E4938B3838"/>
niece; perhaps, becauſe her uſual inſenſibility failed her, and ſhe feared to truſt herſelf with a view of Emily's diſtreſs; or poſſibly, though her conſcience was ſeldom audible, it now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached her with her conduct to her brother's orphan child, whoſe happineſs had been entruſted to her care by a dying father.</p>
                     <p>Emily could not look at theſe preſents, and made a laſt, though almoſt hopeleſs effort to intereſt the compaſſion of Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ame Montoni, who, if ſhe did feel any degree of pity, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, ſucceſsfully concealed it, and reproached her niece with folly in being miſerable, concerning a marriage, which ought only to make her happy. "I am ſure," ſaid ſhe, "if I was unmarried, and the Count had propoſed to me, I ſhould have been flattered by the diſtinction: and if I ſhould have been ſo, I am ſure, niece, you, who have no fortune, ought to feel your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf highly honoured, and ſhew a proper gratitude and humility towards the Count, for his condeſcenſion. I am often ſurpriſed, I muſt own, to obſerve how humbly he deports himſelf to you, notwithſtanding the haughty airs you give yourſelf; I wonder he has patience to humour you ſo: if I was he, I know, I ſhould often be ready to reprehend you, and make you know yourſelf a little better. I would not have flattered you, I can tell you, for it is this abſurd flattery that makes you fancy yourſelf of ſo much conſequence, that you think nobody can deſerve you, and I often tell the Count ſo, for I have no patience to hear him pay you ſuch extravagant compliments, which you believe every word of!"</p>
                     <p>"Your patience, madam, cannot ſuffer more cruelly on ſuch occaſions, than my own," ſaid Emily.</p>
                     <p>"O! that is all mere affectation," rejoined her aunt. "I know that his flattery delights you, and makes you ſo vain, that you think you have the whole world at your feet. But you are very much miſtaken; I can aſſure you, niece, you will not meet with many ſuch ſuitors as the Count: every other perſon would have turned upon his heels, and left you to repent at your leiſure, long ago."</p>
                     <p>"O that the Count had reſembled every other perſon, then!" ſaid Emily with a heavy ſigh.</p>
                     <p>"It is happy for you, that he does not," rejoined Madame Montoni; "and what I am now ſaying is from pure kindneſs. I am endeavouring to convince you of your good fortune, and to perſuade you to ſubmit to neceſſity with a good grace. It is nothing to me, you know, whether you like this marriage or not, for it muſt be; what I ſay therefore, is from pure kindneſs.
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:029378_0113_0FE080E9289A9B88"/>
I wiſh to ſee you happy, and it is your own fault if you are not ſo. I would aſk you, now, ſeriouſly and calmly, what kind of a match you can expect, ſince a Count cannot content your ambition?"</p>
                     <p>"I have no ambition whatever, madam," replied Emily, "my only wiſh is to remain in my preſent ſtation."</p>
                     <p>"O! that is ſpeaking quite from the purpoſe," ſaid her aunt, "I ſee you are ſtill thinking of Monſ. Valancourt. Pray get rid of all thoſe fantaſtic notions about love, and this ridiculous pride, and be ſomething like a reaſonable creature. But, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, this is nothing to the purpoſe—for your marriage with, the Count takes place to-morrow, you know, whether you approve it or not. The Count will be trifled with no longer."</p>
                     <p>Emily made no attempt to reply to this curious ſpeech; ſhe felt it would be mean, and ſhe knew it would be uſeleſs. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame Montoni laid the Count's preſents upon the table, on which Emily was leaning, and then, deſiring ſhe would be ready early in the morning, bade her good night. "Good night, madam," ſaid Emily, with a deep ſigh, as the door cloſed upon her aunt, and ſhe was left once more to her own ſad reflections. For ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſhe ſat loſt in thought, as to be wholly unconſcious where ſhe was; at length, raiſing her head, and looking round the room, its gloom and profound ſtillneſs awed her. She fixed her eyes on the door, thro' which her aunt had diſappeared, and liſtened anxiouſly for ſome ſound, that might relieve the deep dejection of her ſpirits; but it was paſt midnight, and all the family, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the ſervant, who ſat up for Montoni, had retired to bed. Her mind, long haraſſed by diſtreſs, now yielded to imaginary terrors; ſhe trembled to look into the obſcurity of her ſpacious chamber, and feared ſhe knew not what; a ſtate of mind, which continued ſo long, that ſhe would have called up Annette, her aunt's woman, had her fears permitted her to riſe from her chair, and to croſs the apartment.</p>
                     <p>Theſe melancholy illuſions at length began to diſperſe, and ſhe retired to her bed, not to ſleep, for that was ſcarcely poſſible, but to try, at leaſt, to quiet her diſturbed fancy, and to collect ſtrength of ſpirits ſufficient to bear her through the ſcene of the approaching morning.</p>

                     <p>EMILY was recalled from a kind of ſlumber, into which ſhe had at length, ſunk, by a quick knocking at her chamber door. She ſtarted up in terror, for Montoni and Count Morano inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly came to her mind; but, having liſtened in ſilence for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, and recogniſing the voice of Annette, ſhe roſe and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the door. "What brings you hither ſo early?" ſaid Emily, trembling exceſſively. She was unable to ſupport herſelf, and ſat down on the bed.</p>
                     <p>"Dear ma'amſelle!" ſaid Annette, "do not look ſo pale. I am quite frightened to ſee you. Here is a fine buſtle below ſtairs, all the ſervants running to and fro, and none of them faſt enough! Here is a buſtle, indeed all of a ſudden, and nobody knows for what!"</p>
                     <p>"Who is below beſides them?" ſaid Emily, "Annette, do not trifle with me!"</p>

"Good God ſupport me!" cried Emily, almoſt fainting, "Count Morano is below, then!"</p>
                     <p>"No, ma'amſelle, he is not below that I know of," replied Annette, "only his <hi>Excellenza,</hi> ſent me to deſire you would get ready directly to leave Venice, for that the gondolas would be at the ſteps of the canal in a few minutes; but I muſt hurry back to my lady, who is juſt at her wits end, and knows not which way to turn for haſte."</p>
                     <p>"Explain, Annette, explain the meaning of all this before you go," ſaid Emily, ſo overcome with ſurpriſe and timid hope, that ſhe had ſcarcely breath to ſpeak.</p>
                     <p>"Nay, ma'amſelle, that is more than I can do. I only know that the Signor is juſt come home in a very ill humour, that he has had us all called out of our beds, and tells us we are all to leave Venice immediately."</p>
                     <p>"Is Count Morano to go with the Signor?" ſaid Emily, "and whither are we going?"</p>
                     <p>"I know neither, ma'am, for certain; but I heard Ludovico ſay ſomething about going, after we got to <hi>Terrafirma,</hi> to the Signor's caſtle among ſome mountains, that he talked of."</p>
                     <p>"The Apennines!" ſaid Emily, eagerly, "O! then I have little to hope!"</p>
                     <p>"That is the very place ma'am. But cheer up, and do not take it ſo much to heart, and think what a little time you have got to get ready in, and how impatient the Signor is. Holy St. Mark! I hear the oars on the canal; and now they come nearer, and now they are daſhing at the ſteps below; it is the gondola, ſure enough."</p>
                     <p>Annette haſtened from the room; and Emily prepared for this unexpected flight as faſt as her trembling hands would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, not perceiving, that any change in her ſituation could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be for the worſe. She had ſcarcely thrown her books and clothes into her travelling trunk, when receiving a ſecond ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, ſhe went down to her aunt's dreſſing-room, where ſhe found Montoni impatiently reproving his wife for delay. He went out, ſoon after, to give ſome further orders to his people, and Emily then inquired the occaſion of this haſty journey; but her aunt appeared to be as ignorant as herſelf, and to undertake the journey with more reluctance.</p>
                     <p>The family at length embarked, but neither Count Morano, or Cavigni, was of the party. Somewhat revived by obſerving this, Emily, when the gondolieri daſhed their oars in the water, and put off from the ſteps of the portico, felt like a criminal,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:029378_0116_0FE080F58738D4C8"/>
who receives a ſhort reprieve. Her heart beat yet lighter, when they emerged from the canal into the ocean, and lighter ſtill, when they ſkimmed paſt the walls of St. Mark, without having ſtopped to take up Count Morano.</p>
                     <p>The dawn now began to tint the horizon, and to break upon the ſhores of the Adriatic. Emily did not venture to aſk any queſtions of Montoni, who ſat, for ſometime, in gloomy ſilence, and then rolled himſelf up in his cloak, as if to ſleep, while Madame Montoni did the ſame; but Emily, who could not ſleep, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ndrew one of the little curtains of the gondola, and looked out upon the ſea. The riſing dawn now enlightened the mountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tops of Friuli, but their lower ſides, and the diſtant waves, that rolled at their feet, were ſtill in deep ſhadow. Emily, ſunk in tranquil melancholy, watched the ſtrengthening light ſpreading upon the ocean, ſhewing ſucceſſively, Venice and her iſlets, and the ſhores of Italy, along which boats, with their pointed latin ſails, began to move.</p>
                     <p>The gondolieri were frequently hailed, at this early hour, by the market-people, as they glided by towards Venice, and the <hi>Lagune</hi> ſoon diſplayed a gay ſcene of innumerable little barks, paſſing from <hi>Terrafirma</hi> with proviſions. Emily gave a laſt look to that ſplendid city, but her mind was then occupied by conſidering the probable events that awaited her, in the ſcenes, to which ſhe was removing, and with conjectures, concerning the motive of this ſudden journey. It appeared, upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> conſideration, that Montoni was removing her to his ſecluded caſtle, becauſe he could there, with more probability of ſucceſs, attempt to terrify her into obedience; or, that, ſhould its gloomy and ſequeſtered ſcenes fail of this effect, her forced marriage with the Count could there be ſolemnized with the ſecrecy, which was neceſſary to the honour of Montoni. The little ſpirit, which this reprieve had recalled, now began to fail, and, when Emily reached the ſhore, her mind had ſunk into all its former depreſſion.</p>
                     <p>Montoni did not embark on the Brenta, but purſued his way in carriages acroſs the country, towards the Apennine; during which journey, his manner to Emily was ſo particularly ſevere, that this alone would have confirmed her late conjecture, had any ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

who was indeed ſeldom abſent from them, and of whom ſhe could never hope to hear in the ſolitude, to which ſhe was haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening.</p>
                     <p>At length, the travellers began to aſcend among the Apen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nines. The immenſe pine foreſts, which, at that period, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hung theſe mountains, and between which the road wound, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded all view but of the cliffs aſpiring above, except, that, now and then, an opening through the dark woods allowed the eye a momentary glimſe of the country below. The gloom of theſe ſhades, their ſolitary ſilence, except when the breeze ſwept over their ſummits, the tremendous precipices of the mountains, that came partially to the eye, each aſſiſted to raiſe the ſolemnity of Emily's feelings into awe; ſhe ſaw only images of gloomy grandeur, or of dreadful ſublimity, around her; other images, equally gloomy and equally terrible, gleamed on her imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. She was going ſhe ſcarcely knew whither, under the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of a perſon, from whoſe arbitrary diſpoſition ſhe had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſuffered ſo much, to marry, perhaps, a man who poſſeſſed neither her affection or eſteem; or to endure, beyond the hope of ſuccour, whatever puniſhment revenge, and that Italian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, might dictate. The more ſhe conſidered what might be the motive of the journey, the more ſhe became convinced, that it was for the purpoſe of concluding her nuptials with Count Morano, with that ſecrecy which her reſolute reſiſtance had made neceſſary to the honour, if not to the ſafety of Montoni. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> ſick heart recoiled in deſpair, and ſhe experienced, that, though her mind was already occupied by peculiar diſtreſs, it was ſtill alive to the influence of new and local circumſtance; why elſe did ſhe ſhudder at the idea of this deſolate caſtle?</p>
                     <p>As the travellers ſtill aſcended among the pine foreſts, ſteep roſe over ſteep, the mountains ſeemed to multiply, as they went, and what was the ſummit of one eminence proved to be only the baſe of another. At length, they reached a little plain, where the drivers ſtopped to reſt the mules, whence a ſcene of ſuch extent and magnificence opened below, as drew even from Madame Montoni a note of admiration. Emily loſt, for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, her ſorrows, in the immenſity of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>. Beyond the amphitheatre of mountains that ſtretched below, whoſe tops ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared as numerous almoſt, as the waves of the ſea, and whoſe feet were concealed by the foreſts—extended the <hi>Campagna</hi> of Italy, where cities and rivers, and woods and all the glow of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:029378_0117_0FE08106588C5128"/>
cultivation were mingled in gay confuſion. The Adriatic bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the horizon, into which the Po and the Brenta, after winding through the whole extent of the landſcape, poured their fruitful waves. Emily gazed long on the ſplendours of the world ſhe was quitting, of which the whole magnificence ſeemed thus given to her ſight only to increaſe her regret on leaving it; for her, Valancourt alone was in that world; to him alone her heart turned, and for him alone fell her bitter tears.</p>
                     <p>From this ſublime ſcene the travellers continued to aſcend among the pines, till they entered a narrow paſs of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, which ſhut out every feature of the diſtant country, and, in its ſtead, exhibited only tremendous crags, impending over the road, where no veſtige of humanity, or even of vegitation, appeared, except here and there the trunk and ſcathed branches of an oak, that hung nearly headlong from the rock, into which its ſtrong roots had faſtened. This paſs, which led into the heart of the Apennine, at length opened to day, and a ſcene of mountains ſtretched in long perſpective, as wild as any the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers had yet paſſed. Still vaſt pine-foreſts hung upon their baſe, and crowned their ridgy precipice, that roſe perpendicular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the vale, while, above, the rolling miſts caught the ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams, and touched their cliffs with all the magical colouring of light and ſhade. The ſcene ſeemed perpetually changing, and its features to aſſume new forms, as the winding road brought them to the eye in different <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>; while the ſhifting va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, now partially concealing then minuter beauties, and now illuminating them with ſplendid tints, aſſiſted the illuſions of the ſight.</p>
                     <p>Though the deep vallies between theſe mountains were, for the moſt part, clothed with pines, ſometimes an abrupt opening preſented a perſpective of only barren rocks, with a cataract flaſhing from their ſummit among broken cliffs, till its waters, reaching the bottom, foamed along with unceaſing fury; and ſometimes paſtoral ſcenes exhibited their "green delights" in the narrow vales, ſmiling amid ſurrounding horror. There herds and flocks of goats and ſheep, browſing under the ſhade of hanging woods, and the ſhepherd's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Wild and romantic as were theſe ſcenes, their character had far leſs of the ſublime, than had thoſe of the Alps, which guard the entrance of Italy. Emily was often elevated, but ſeldom felt thoſe emotions of indeſcribable awe, which ſhe had ſo continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally experienced, in her paſſage over the Alps.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="8" facs="unknown:029378_0118_0FE0810B610381F0"/>
Towards the cloſe of day, the road wound into a deep valley. Mountains, whoſe ſhaggy ſteeps appeared to be inacceſſible, almoſt ſurrounded it. To the eaſt, a viſta opened, that exhibited the Apennines in their darkeſt horrors: and the long perſpective of retiring ſummits, riſing over each other, their ridges clothed with pines, exhibited a ſtronger image of grandeur, than any that Emily had yet ſeen. The ſun had juſt ſunk below the top of the mountains ſhe was deſcending, whoſe long ſhadow ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed athwart the valley, but his ſloping rays, ſhooting through an opening of the cliffs, touched with a yellow gleam the ſummits of the foreſt, that hung upon the oppoſite ſteeps, and ſtreamed in full ſplendour upon the towers and battlements of a caſtle, that ſpread its extenſive ramparts along the brow of a precipice above. The ſplendour of theſe illumined objects was heightend by the contraſted ſhade, which involved the valley below:</p>
                     <p>"There," ſaid Montoni, ſpeaking for the firſt time in ſeveral hours, "is Udolpho."</p>
                     <p>Emily gazed with melancholy awe upon the caſtle, which ſhe underſtood to be Montoni's; for, though it was now lighted up by the ſetting ſun, the gothic greatneſs of its features, and its mouldering walls of dark gray ſtone, rendered it a gloomy and ſublime o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ject. As ſhe gazed, the light died away on its walls, leaving a melancholy purple tint, which ſpread deeper and deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as the thin vapour crept up the mountain, while the battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments above were ſtill tipped with ſplendour. From thoſe too, the rays ſoon faded, and the whole edifice was inveſted with the ſolemn duſkineſs of evening. Silent, lonely and ſublime, it ſeemed to ſtand the ſovereign of the ſcene, and to frown defiance on all, who dared to invade its ſolitary reign. As the twilight deepened, its features became more awful in obſcurity, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily continued to gaze, till its cluſtering towers were alone ſeen, riſing over the tops of the woods, beneath whoſe thick ſhade the carriages ſoon after began to aſcend.</p>
                     <p>The extent and darkneſs of theſe tall woods awakened terrific images in her mind, and ſhe almoſt expected to ſee banditti ſtart up from under the trees. At length the carriages emerged upon a heathy rock, and, ſoon after, reached the caſtle gates, where the deep tone of the portal bell, which was ſtruck upon to give notice of their arrival, increaſed the fearful emotions, that had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailed Emily. While they waited till the ſervant within ſhould come to open the gates, ſhe anxiouſly ſurveyed the edifice: but the gloom, that overſpread it, allowed her to diſtinguiſh little more than a part of its outline, with the maſſy walls of the ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:029378_0118_0FE0810B610381F0"/>
and to know, that it was vaſt, ancient and dreary. From the parts ſhe ſaw, ſhe judged of the heavy ſtrength and extent of the whole. The gateway before her, leading into the courts, was of gigantic ſize, and was defended by two round towers, crowned by overhanging turrets, embattled, where, inſtead of banners, now waved long graſs and wild plants, that had taken root among the mouldering ſtones, and which ſeemed to ſigh as the breeze rolled paſt, over the deſolation around them. The towers were united by a curtain, pierced and embattled alſo, below which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared the pointed arch of a huge portcullis, ſurmounting the gates: from theſe, the walls of the ramparts extended to other towers, overlooking the precipice, whoſe ſhattered outline, appearing on a gleam, that lingered in the weſt, told of the ravages of war. Beyond theſe all was loſt in the obſcurity of evening.</p>
                     <p>While Emily gazed with awe upon the ſcene, footſteps were heard within the gates, and the undrawing of bolts; after which an ancient ſervant of the caſtle appeared, forcing back the huge folds of the portal, to admit his lord. As the carriage-wheels rolled heavily under the portcullis, Emily's heart ſunk, and ſhe ſeemed, as if ſhe was going into her priſon; the gloomy court, into which ſhe paſſed, ſerved to confirm the idea, and her imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ination, ever awake to circumſtance, ſuggeſted even more terrors, than her reaſon could juſtify.</p>
                     <p>Another gate delivered them into the ſecond court, graſs-grown, and more wild than the firſt, where, as ſhe ſurveyed through the twilight its deſolation—its lofty walls, overtopt with briony, moſs and nightſhade, and the embattled towers that roſe above, long ſuffering and murder came to her thoughts. One of thoſe inſtantaneous and unaccountable convictions which ſometimes conquer even ſtrong minds, impreſſed her with its horror. The ſentiment was not diminiſhed, when ſhe entered an extenſive gothic hall, obſcured by the gloom of evening, which a light, glimmering at a diſtance through a long perſpective of arches, only rendered more ſtriking. As a ſervant brought the lamp nearer, partial gleams fell upon the pillars and the pointed arches, forming a ſtrong contraſt with their ſhadows, that ſtretched along the pavement and the walls. The ſudden journey of Montoni had prevented his people from making any other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations for his reception, than could be had in the ſhort inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, ſince the arrival of the ſervant, who had been ſent forward from Venice; and this, in ſome meaſure, may account for the air of extreme deſolation, that every where appeared.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="10" facs="unknown:029378_0119_0FE0811ABB3ACFB0"/>
The ſervant, who came to light Montoni, bowed in ſilence, and the muſcles of his countenance relaxed with no ſymptom of joy. Montoni noticed the ſalutation by a ſlight motion of his hand, and paſſed on, while his lady, following, and looking round with a degree of ſurpriſe and diſcontent, which ſhe ſeemed fearful of expreſſing, and Emily, ſurveying the extent and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of the hall in timid wonder, approached a marble ſtaircaſe. The arches here opened to a lofty vault, from the centre of which hung a tripod lamp, which a ſervant was haſtily lighting; and the rich fretwork of the roof, a corridor, leading into ſeveral up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per apartments, and a painted window, ſtretching nearly from the pavement to the ceiling of the hall, became gradually viſible.</p>
                     <p>Having croſſed the foot of the ſtaircaſe, and paſſed through an anti-room, they entered a ſpacious apartment, whoſe walls, wainſcoted with black larch wood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the growth of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mountains, were ſcarcely diſtinguiſhable from darkneſs itſelf. "Bring more light," ſaid Montoni, as he entered. The ſervant ſetting down his lamp, was withdrawing to obey him, when Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame Montoni obſerving, that the evening air of this mountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous region was cold, and that ſhe ſhould like a fire, Montoni ordered that wood might be brought.</p>
                     <p>While he paced the room with thoughtful ſteps, and Madame Montoni ſat ſilently on a couch, at the upper end of it, waiting till the ſervant returned, Emily was obſerving the ſingular ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity and deſolation of the apartment, viewed, as it now was, by the glimmer of the ſingle lamp, placed near a large Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian mirror, that duſkily reflected the ſcene, with the tall figure of Montoni paſſing ſlowly along, his arms folded, and his countenance ſhaded by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>From the contemplation of this ſcene, Emily's mind pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the apprehenſion of what ſhe might ſuffer in it, till the remembrance of Valancourt, far, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"Your <hi>Excellenza</hi> is welcome to the caſtle," ſaid the old man, as he raiſed himſelf from the hearth, where he had laid the wood: "it has been a lonely place a long while; but you will excuſe it, Signor, knowing we had but ſhort notice.

                     <p>"You have a good memory, old Carlo," ſaid Montoni: "it is thereabout; and how haſt thou contrived to live ſo long."</p>
                     <p>"A-well-a-day, ſir, with much ado; the cold winds, that blow through the caſtle in winter, are almoſt too much for me; and I thought ſometimes of aſking your <hi>Excellenza</hi> to let me leave the mountains, and go down into the lowlands.

                     <p>"But there are no more repairs wanted," ſaid Montoni, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently.</p>
                     <p>"O Lord! your <hi>Excellenza,</hi> yes—the wall of the rampart has tumbled down in three places; then, the ſtairs that lead to the weſt gallery, have been a long time ſo bad, that it is danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to go up them; and the paſſage leading to the great oak chamber, that overhangs the north rampart—one night laſt win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I ventured to go there by myſelf, and your <hi>Excellenza"</hi>—</p>
                     <p>"Well, well, enough of this," ſaid Montoni, with quickneſs: "I will talk more with thee to-morrow."</p>
                     <p>The fire was now lighted; Carlo ſwept the hearth, placed chairs, wiped the duſt from a large marble table that ſtood near it, and then left the room.</p>

Montoni and his family drew round the fire. Madame Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni made ſeveral attempts at converſation, but his ſullen anſwers repulſed her, while Emily ſat endeavouring to acquire courage enough to ſpeak to him. At length, in a tremulous voice, ſhe ſaid, "May I aſk, ſir, the motive of this ſudden journey?" Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long pauſe, ſhe recovered ſufficient courage to repeat the queſtion.</p>

                     <p>"Good night, my dear," ſaid Madame Montoni, in a tone of kindneſs, which her niece had never before heard from her: and the unexpected endearment brought tears <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"Do you know which is my room?" ſaid ſhe to Annette, as they croſſed the hall.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, I believe I do, ma'amſelle; but this is ſuch a ſtrange rambling place! I have been loſt in it already: they call it the double <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Emily aſcended the marble ſtaircaſe, and came to the corridor, as they paſſed through which, Annette reſumed her chat. "What a wild lonely place this is, ma'am <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

"Yes," ſaid Emily, ſmiling, and glad to eſcape from more ſerious thought, "if we come to the corridor, about midnight, and look down into the hall, we ſhall certainly ſee it illuminated with a thouſand lamps, and the fairies tripping in gay circles to the ſound of delicious muſic; for it is in ſuch places as this, you know, that they come to hold their revels.

                     <p>"I hope," ſaid Emily, "you will not ſuffer Signor Montoni to hear of theſe weak fears; they would highly diſpleaſe him."</p>
                     <p>"What, you know then, ma'amſelle, all about it!" rejoined Annette. "No, no, I do know better than to do ſo; though, if the Signor can ſleep ſound, nobody elſe in the caſtle has any right to lie awake, I am ſure." Emily did not appear to notice this remark.</p>
                     <p>"Down this paſſage, ma'amſelle; this leads to a back ſtair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe. O! if I ſee any thing, I ſhall be frightened out of my wits!"</p>
                     <p>"That will ſcarcely be poſſible," ſaid Emily, ſmiling, as ſhe followed the winding of the paſſage, which opened into another gallery: and then Annette, perceiving that ſhe had miſſed her way, while ſhe had been ſo eloquently haranguing on ghoſts and fairies, wandered about through other paſſages and galleries, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

aloud for aſſiſtance: but they were beyond the hearing of the ſervants, who were on the other ſide of the caſtle, and Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly now opened the door of a chamber on the left.</p>
                     <p>"O! do not go in there, ma'amſelle," ſaid Annette, "you will only loſe yourſelf further."</p>
                     <p>"Bring the light forward," ſaid Emily, "we may poſſibly find our way through theſe rooms."</p>
                     <p>Annette ſtood at the door, in an attitude of heſitation, with the light held up to ſhew the chamber, but the feeble rays ſpread through not half of it. "Why do you heſitate?" ſaid Emily, "let me ſee whither this room leads."</p>
                     <p>Annette advanced reluctantly. It opened into a ſuite of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and ancient apartments, ſome of which were hung with ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtry, and others wainſcoted with cedar and black larch wood. What furniture there was, ſeemed to be almoſt as old as the rooms, and retained an appearance of grandeur, though covered with duſt, and dropping to pieces with the damps, and with age.</p>
                     <p>"How cold theſe rooms are, ma'amſelle?" ſaid Annette: "nobody has lived in them for many, many years, they ſay. Do let us go."</p>
                     <p>"They may open upon the great ſtaircaſe, perhaps," ſaid Emily, paſſing on till ſhe came to a chamber, hung with pictures, and took the light to examine that of a ſoldier on horſeback in a field of battle.—He was darting his ſpear upon a man, who lay under the feet of the horſe, and who held up one hand in a ſupplicating attitude. The ſoldier whoſe beaver was up, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded him with a look of vengeance, and the countenance, with that expreſſion, ſtruck Emily as reſembling Montoni. She ſhud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and turned from it. Paſſing the light haſtily over ſeveral other pictures, ſhe came to one concealed by a veil of black ſilk. The ſingularity of the circumſtance ſtruck her, and ſhe ſtopped before it, wiſhing to remove the veil, and examine what could thus carefully be concealed, but ſomewhat wanting cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. "Holy Virgin! what can this mean?" exclaimed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette. "This is ſurely the picture they told me of at Venice."</p>
                     <p>"What picture?" ſaid Emily. "Why a picture—a picture," replied Annette, heſitatingly—"but I never could make out ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly what it was about, either."</p>
                     <p>"Remove the veil, Annett<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"What! I, ma'amſelle!—I! not for the world!" Emily, turning round, ſaw Annette's countenance grow pale. "And pray, what have you heard of this picture, to terrify you ſo, my

good girl?" ſaid ſhe. "Nothing ma'amſelle: I have heard nothing, only let us find our way out."</p>
                     <p>"Certainly: but I wiſh firſt to examine the picture; take the light, Annette, while I lift the veil." Annette took the light, and immediately walked away with it, diſregarding Emily's calls to ſtay, who, not chooſing to be left alone in the dark chamber, at length followed her. "What is the reaſon of this, Annette?" ſaid Emily, when ſhe overtook her, "what have you heard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that picture, which makes you ſo unwilling to ſtay when I bid you?"</p>
                     <p>"I don't know what is the reaſon, ma'amſelle," replied An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"Well, Annette" ſaid Emily, ſmiling, "I perceive it is as you ſay—that you know nothing about the picture."</p>
                     <p>"No, nothing, indeed, ma'amſelle, for they made me pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe never to tell: but"—</p>
                     <p>"Well," rejoined Emily, who obſerved that ſhe was ſtruggling between her inclination to reveal a ſecret, and her apprehenſion for the conſequence, "I will inquire no further"—</p>
                     <p>"No, pray, ma'am, do not."</p>
                     <p>"Leſt you ſhould tell all," interrupted Emily.</p>
                     <p>Annette bluſh'd, and Emily ſmiled, and they paſſed on to the extremity of this ſuite of apartments, and found themſelves after ſome further perplexity, once more at the top of the marble ſtair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe, where Annette left Emily, while ſhe went to call one of the ſervants of the caſtle to ſhew them to the chamber, for which they had been ſeeking.</p>
                     <p>While ſhe was abſent, Emily's thoughts returned to the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; an unwillingneſs to tamper with the integrity of a ſervant had checked her inquiries on this ſubject, as well as concerning ſome alarming hints, which Annette had dropped reſpecting Montoni; though her curioſity was entirely awakened, and ſhe had perceived, that her queſtions might eaſily be anſwered. She was now, however, inclined to go back to the apartment and examine the picture; but the lonelineſs of the hour and of the place, with the melancholy ſilence that reigned around her, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired with a certain degree of awe, excited by the myſtery at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending this picture, to prevent her. She determined, however,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:029378_0122_0FE08131804D0E90"/>
when daylight ſhould have re-animated her ſpirits, to go thither and remove the veil. As ſhe leaned from the corridor, over the ſtaircaſe, and her eyes wandered round, ſhe again ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, with wonder, the vaſt ſtrength of the walls, now ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what decayed, and the pillars of ſolid marble, that roſe from the hall, and ſupported the roof.</p>
                     <p>A ſervant now appeared with Annette, and conducted Emily to her chamber, which was in a remote part of the caſtle, and at the end of the very corridor, from whence the ſuite of apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments opened, through which they had been wandering. The lonely aſpect of her room made Emily unwilling that Annette ſhould leave her immediately, and the dampneſs of it chilled her with more than fear. She begged Caterina, the ſervant of the caſtle, to bring ſome wood and light a fire.</p>
                     <p>"Aye, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"I wonder, ma'am, why they call this the double chamber?" ſaid Annette, while Emily ſurveyed it in ſilence, and ſaw th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

She wiſhed much to inquire when Count Morano was expected at the caſtle, but an unwillingneſs to aſk unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary queſtions, and to mention family concerns to a ſervant withheld her. Meanwhile, Annette's thoughts were engaged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another ſubject: ſhe dearly loved the marvellous, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Such a ſtrange circumſtance, too, and to be obliged to conceal it, was a ſever<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Caterina now brought the wood, and its bright blaze diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

for a while, the gloom of the chamber. She told Annette that her lady had inquired for her, and Emily was once again left to her own ſad reflections. Her heart was nor yet harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the ſtern manners of Montoni, and ſhe was nearly as much ſhocked now, as ſhe had been when ſhe firſt witneſſed them. The tenderneſs and affection, to which ſhe had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed, till ſhe loſt her parents, had made her particularly ſenſible to any degree of unkindneſs, and ſuch a reverſe as this no apprehenſion had prepared her to ſupport.</p>
                     <p>To call off her attention from ſubjects, that preſſed heavily upon her ſpirits, ſhe roſe and again examined her room and its furniture. As ſhe walked round it, ſhe paſſed a door, that was not quite ſhut, and, perceiving, that it was not the one, through which ſhe entered, ſhe brought the light forward to diſcover whither it led. She opened it, and, going forward, had nearly fallen down a ſteep, narrow ſtaircaſe, that wound from it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two ſtone walls. She wiſhed to know to what it led, and was the more anxious, ſince it communicated ſo immediately with her apartment; but, in the preſent ſtate of her ſpirits, ſhe wanted courage to venture into the darkneſs alone. Cloſing the door, therefore, ſhe endeavoured to faſten it, but, upon fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther examination, perceived, that it had no bolts on the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſide, though it had two on the other. By placing a heavy chair againſt it, ſhe in ſome meaſure remedied the defect; yet ſhe was ſtill alarmed at the thought of ſleeping in this remote room alone, with a door opening ſhe knew not whither, and which could not be perfectly faſtened on the inſide. Sometimes ſhe wiſhed to entreat of Madame Montoni, that Annette might have leave to remain with her all night, but was deterred by an apprehenſion of betraying what would be thought childiſh fears, and by an unwillingneſs to increaſe the apt terrors of Annette.</p>
                     <p>Her gloomy reflections were, ſoon after interrupted by a foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtep in the corridor, and ſhe was glad to ſee Annette enter with ſome ſupper, ſent by Madame Montoni. Having a table near the fire, ſhe made the good girl ſit down and ſup with her; and, when their little repaſt was over, Annette, encouraged by her kindneſs and ſtirring the wood into a blaze, drew her chair up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hearth, nearer to Emily, and ſaid,—"Did you ever hear ma'amſelle, of the ſtrange accident, that made the Signor lord of this caſtle?"</p>
                     <p>"What wonderful ſtory have you now to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

"I have heard all about it, ma'amſell," ſaid Annette, looking round the chamber and drawing cloſer to Emily; "Benedetto told it me as we travelled together: ſays he, "Annette, you don't know about this caſtle here, that we are going to? No, ſays I, Mr. Benedetto, pray what do you know? But, ma'am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle, you can keep a ſecret, or I would not tell it you for the world; for I promiſed never to tell, and they ſay, that the Signor does not like to have it talked of."</p>
                     <p>"If you promiſed to keep this ſecret," ſaid Emily, "you do right not to mention it."</p>
                     <p>Annette pauſed a moment, and then ſaid, "O, but to you, ma'amſelle, to you I may tell it ſafely, I know."</p>
                     <p>Emily ſmiled, "I certainly ſhall keep it as faithfully as your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, Annette."</p>
                     <p>Annette replied very gravely, that would do, and proceeded—"This caſtle, you muſt know, ma'amſelle, is very old, and very ſtrong, and has ſtood out many ſieges, as they ſay. Now it was not Signor Montoni's always, nor his father's, no; but by ſome, law or other, it was to come to the Signor, if the lady died un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married."</p>
                     <p>"What lady?" ſaid Emily.</p>
                     <p>"I am not come to that yet," replied Annette, "it is the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy I am going to tell you about, ma'amſelle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but, as I was ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, this lady lived in the caſtle, and had every thing very grand about her, as you may ſuppoſe ma'amſelle. The Signor uſed of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to come to ſee her, and was in love with her, and offered to marry her; for, though he was ſomehow related, that did not ſignify. But ſhe was in love with ſomebody elſe, and would not have him, which made him very angry, as they ſay, and you know ma'amſelle, what an ill looking gentleman he is, when he is angry. Perhaps ſhe ſaw him in a paſſion, and therefore would not have him. But, as I was ſaying, ſhe was very melancholy and unhappy, and all that, for a long while, and—Holy Virgin! what noiſe is that? did not you hear a ſound, ma'amſelle?"</p>
                     <p>"It is only the wind," ſaid Emily, "<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"As I was ſaying—O, where was I?—as I was ſaying—ſhe was very melancholy and unhappy a long while, and uſed to walk about upon the terrace, there, under the windows, by her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and cry ſo! it would have done your heart good to hear her. That is—I don't mean good, but it would have made you cry too, as they tell me."</p>
                     <p>"Well, but, Annette, do tell me the ſubſtance of your tale."</p>

"All in good time, ma'am; all this I heard before at Venice, but what is to come I never heard till to day. This happened a great many years ago, when Signor Montoni was quite a young man. The lady they called her Signora Laurentini, was very handſome, but ſhe uſed to be in great paſſions, too, ſometimes, as well as the Signor. Finding he could not make her liſten to him—what does he do but leave the caſtle, and never comes near it for a long time! but it was all one to her; ſhe was juſt as unhappy whether he was here or not, till one evening, Holy St. Peter! ma'amſelle," cried Annette, "look at that lamp, ſee how blue it burns!" She looked fearfully round the chamber. "Ridiculous girl!" ſaid Emily, "why will you indulge thoſe fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies? Pray let me hear the end of your ſtory, I am weary."</p>
                     <p>Annette ſtill kept her eyes on the lamp, and proceeded in a lower voice. "It was one evening, they ſay, at the latter end of the year, it might be about the middle of September, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, or the beginning of October; nay, for that matter, it might be November, for that, too, is the latter end of the year, but that I cannot ſay for certain, becauſe they did not tell me for certain themſelves. However, it was at the latter end of the year, this grand lady walked out of the caſtle into the woods below, as ſhe had often done before, all alone only her maid was with her. The wind blew cold, and ſtrewed the leaves about, and whiſtled diſmally among thoſe great old cheſnut trees, that we paſſed, ma'amſelle, as we came to the caſtle—for Benedetto ſhewed me the trees, as he was talking—the wind blew cold, and her woman would have perſuaded her to return: but all would not do, for ſhe was fond of walking in the woods, at evening time, and if the leaves were falling about her, ſo much the better.</p>
                     <p>"Well, they ſaw her go down among the woods, but night came, and ſhe did not return; ten o'clock, eleven o'clock, twelve o'clock came, and no lady! Well, the ſervants thought to be ſure, ſome accident had befallen her, and they went out to ſeek her. They ſearched all night long, but could not find her, or any trace of her, and, from that day to this, ma'amſelle ſhe has never been heard of."</p>
                     <p>"Is this true, Annette?" ſaid Emily in much ſurpriſe.</p>
                     <p>"True, ma'am!" ſaid Annette, with a look of horror, "yes, it is true, indeed. But they do ſay," ſhe added, lowering her voice, "they do ſay, that the Signora has been ſeen, ſeveral times ſince, walking in the woods and about the caſtle in the night: ſeveral of the old ſervants, who remained here ſometime
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:029378_0124_0FE08144F9F4D290"/>
after, declare they ſaw her; and, ſince then, ſhe has been ſeen by ſome of the vaſſals, who have happened to be in the caſtle, at night. Carlo, the old ſteward, could tell ſuch things, they ſay, if he would."</p>
                     <p>"How contradictory is this, Annette!" ſaid Emily, "you ſay nothing has been ſince known of her, and yet ſhe has been ſeen!"</p>
                     <p>"But all this was told me for a great ſecret," rejoined An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette, without noticing the remark, "and I am <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"O! a great deal, indeed, ma'amſelle, for the Signor laid claim to the caſtle directly, as being the next heir, and they ſaid, that is, the judges or the ſenators, or ſomebody of that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

But the ſtory went round, and many ſtrange reports were ſpread ſo very ſtrange, ma'amſelle, that I ſhall not tell them."</p>
                     <p>"That is ſtranger ſtill, Annette," ſaid Emily, ſmiling, and rouſing herſelf from her reverie. "But, when Signora Lauren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tini was afterwards ſeen in the caſtle, did nobody ſpeak to her?"</p>
                     <p>"Speak—ſpeak to her!" cried Annette, with a look of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; "no, to be ſure."</p>
                     <p>"And why not?" rejoined Emily, willing to hear further.</p>
                     <p>"Holy Mother! ſpeak to a ſpirit!"</p>
                     <p>"But what reaſon had they to conclude it was a ſpirit unleſs they had approached, and, ſpoken to it?"</p>
                     <p>"O ma'amſelle, I cannot tell. How can you aſk ſuch ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing queſtions? But nobody ever ſaw it come in, or go out <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

ma'amſelle, no;" replied Annette, rather angrily, "but becauſe ſomething has been ſeen there. They ſay, too, there is an old chapel adjoining the weſt ſide of the caſtle, where, any time at midnight, you may hear ſuch groans!—it makes one ſhudder to think of them!—and ſtrange ſights have been ſeen there—"</p>
                     <p>"Pr'ythee, Annette, no more of theſe ſilly tales," ſaid Emily.</p>
                     <p>"Silly tales, ma'amſelle! O, but I will tell you one ſtory about this, if you pleaſe, that Caterina told me. It was one cold win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's night that Caterina (ſhe often came to the caſtle then, ſhe ſays, to keep old Carlo and his wife company, and ſo he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended her afterwards to the Signor, and ſhe lived here ever ſince) Caterina was ſitting with them in the little hall, ſays Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo, I wiſh we had ſome of thoſe figs to roaſt, that lie in the ſtore cloſet, but it is along way off, and I am loath to fetch them; do, Caterina," ſays he, "for you are young and nimble, do bring us ſome, the fire is in a nice trim for roaſting them; they lie," ſays he, "in ſuch a corner of the ſtoreroom, at the end of the north-gallery; here, take the lamp," ſays he, "and mind, as you go up the great ſtaircaſe, that the wind, through the roof, does not blow it out." So, with that, Caterina took the lamp—Huſh! ma'amſelle, I ſurely heard a noiſe!"</p>
                     <p>Emily, whom Annette had now infected with her own ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, liſtened attentively; but every thing was ſtill, and Annette proceeded:</p>
                     <p>"Caterina went to the north gallery, that is the wide gallery we paſſed, ma'am, before we came to the corridor, here. As, ſhe went with the lamp in her hand thinking of nothing at all—There, again!" cried Annette, ſuddenly—"I heard it again!—it was not fancy, ma'amſelle!"</p>
                     <p>"Huſh!" ſaid Emily, trembling. They liſtened, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing to ſit quite ſtill, Emily heard a low knocking againſt the wall. It came repeatedly. Annette then ſcreamed loudly, and the chamber door ſlowly opened. It was Caterina, come to tell Annette, that her lady wanted her. Emily, though ſhe now perceived who it was, could not immediately overcome her terror; while Annette, half laughing, half crying, ſcolded Caterina heartily for thus alarming them; and was alſo terrified leſt what ſhe had told had been overheard. Emily, whoſe mind was deeply impreſſed by the chief circumſtance of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette's relation, was unwilling to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e left alone, in the preſent ſtate of her ſpirits; but, to avoid offending Madame Montoni, and betraying her own weakneſs, ſhe ſtruggled to overcome the illuſions of fear, and diſmiſſed Annette for the night.</p>

                        <pb n="22" facs="unknown:029378_0125_0FE08153D72F8048"/>
When ſhe was alone, her thoughts recurred to the ſtrange hiſtory of Signora Laurentini and then to her own ſtrange ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the wild and ſolitary mountains of a foreign country, in the caſtle, and the power of a man, to whom, only a few pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding months, ſhe was an entire ſtanger; who had already exerciſed an uſurped authority over her, and whoſe character ſhe now regarded with a degree of terror, apparently juſtified by the fears of others. She knew, that he had invention equal to the conception and talents to the execution of any project, and ſhe greatly feared he had a heart too void of feeling to oppoſe the perpetration of whatever his intereſt might ſuggeſt. She had long obſerved the unhappineſs of Madame Montoni, and had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten been witneſs to the ſtern and contemptuous behaviour ſhe received from her huſband. To theſe circumſtances, which conſpired to give her juſt cauſe for alarm, were now added thoſe thouſand nameleſs terrors, which exiſt only in active im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginations, and which ſet reaſon and examination equally at defiance.</p>
                     <p>Emily remembered all that Valancourt had told her, on the eve of her departure from Languedoc, reſpecting Montoni, and all that he had ſaid to diſſuade her from venturing on the journey. His fears had often ſince appeared to her prophetic—now they ſeemed confirmed. Her heart, as it gave her back the image of Valancourt, mourned in vain regret, but reaſon ſoon came with a conſolation, which, though feeble at firſt, acquired vigour from reflection. She conſidered, that, whatever might be her ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſhe had withheld from involving him in misfortune, and that, whatever her future ſorrows could be, ſhe was, at leaſt, free from ſelf reproach.</p>
                     <p>Her melancholy was aſſiſted by the hollow ſighings of the wind along the corridor and round the caſtle. The cheerful blaze of the wood had long been extinguiſhed, and ſhe ſat with her eyes fixed on the dying embers, till a loud guſt, that ſwept through the corridor, and ſhook the doors and caſements, alarmed her, for its violence had moved the chair ſhe had placed as a faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the door, leading to the private ſtaircaſe, ſtood half open. Her curioſity and her fears were again awakened. She took the lamp to the top of the ſteps, and ſtood heſitating whether to go down; but again the profound ſtillneſs and the gloom of the place awed her, and, determining to inquire further, when day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light might aſſiſt the ſearch, ſhe cloſed the door, and placed againſt it a ſtronger guard.</p>

She now retired to her bed, leaving the lamp burning on the table; but its gloomy light, inſtead of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>DAYLIGHT diſpelled from Emily's mind the glooms of ſuperſtition, but not thoſe of apprehenſion. The Count Morano was the firſt image, that occurred to her waking thoughts, and than came a train of anticipated evils, which ſhe could neither conquer, or avoid. She roſe, and, to relieve her mind from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> ideas, that tormented it, compelled herſelf to notice exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal objects. From her caſement ſhe looked out upon the wild grandeur of the ſcene, cloſed nearly on all ſides by alpine ſteeps, whoſe tops, peeping over each other, faded from the eye in miſty hues, while the promontories below, were dark with woods, that ſwept down to their baſe, and ſtretched along the narrow vallies. The rich pomp of theſe woods was particularly delightful to Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily; and ſhe viewed with aſtoniſhment the fortifications of the caſtle ſpreading along a vaſt extent of rock, and now partly in decay, the grandeur of the ramparts below, and the towers and battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and various features of the fabric above. From theſe her ſight wandered over the cliffs and woods into the valley, along which foamed a broad and rapid ſtream, ſeen falling among the crags of an oppoſite mountain, now flaſhing in the ſunbeams, and now ſhadowed by overarching pines, till it was entirely concealed by their thick foliage. Again it burſt from beneath this dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in one broad ſheet of foam, and fell thundering into the vale. Nearer, towards the weſt, opened the mountain viſta, which Emily had viewed with ſuch ſublime emotion, on her approach to the caſtle: a thin duſky vapour, that roſe from the valley, overſpread its features with a ſweet obſcurity. As this aſcended and caught the ſunbeams, it kindled into a crimſon tint, and touched with
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:029378_0126_0FE0815977FEB398"/>
exquiſite beauty the woods and cliffs, over which it paſſed to the ſummit of the mountains; then, as the veil drew up, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful, to watch the gleaming objects, that progreſſively diſclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed themſelves in the valley—the green turf—dark woods—little rocky receſſes—a few peaſants' huts—the foaming ſtream—a herd of cattle, and various images of paſtoral beauty. Then, the pine foreſts brightened, and then the broad breaſt of the mountains, till, at length, the miſt ſettled round their ſummit, touching them with a ruddy glow. The features of the viſta now appeared diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly, and the broad deep ſhadows, that fell from the lower cliffs, gave ſtrong effect to the ſtreaming ſplendour above; while the mountains, gradually ſinking in the perſpective, appeared to ſhelve into the Adriatic ſea, for ſuch Emily imagined to be the gleam of blueiſh light, that terminated the view.</p>
                     <p>Thus ſhe endeavoured to amuſe her fancy, and was not unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful. The breezy freſhneſs of the morning, too, revived her. She raiſed her thoughts in prayer, which ſhe felt always moſt diſpoſed to do, when viewing the ſublimity of nature, and her mind recovered its ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe turned from the caſement, her eyes glanced upon the door ſhe had ſo carefully guarded, on the preceding night and ſhe now determined to examine whither it led; but, on ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing to remove the chairs, ſhe perceived, that they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready moved a little way. Her ſurpriſe cannot eaſily be imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined, when, in the next minute, ſhe perceived that the door was faſtened.—She felt, as if ſhe had ſeen an apparition. The door of the corridor was locked as ſhe had left it, but this door, which could be ſecured only on the outſide, muſt have been bolted, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the night. She became ſeriouſly uneaſy at the thought of ſleeping again in a chamber, thus liable to intruſion, ſo remote too, as it was from the family, and ſhe determined to mention the circumſtance to Madame Montoni, and to requeſt a change.</p>
                     <p>After ſome perplexity ſhe found her way into the great hall and to the room, which ſhe had left, on the preceding night where breakfaſt was ſpread, and her aunt was alone, for Montoni had been walking over the environs of the caſtle, examining the condition of its fortifications, and talking for ſometime <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> Carlo. Emily obſerved, that her aunt had been weeping, and her heart ſoftened towards her, with an affection, that ſhewed it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in her manner, rather than in words, while ſhe carefully avoided the appearance of having noticed, that ſhe was unhappy. She ſeized the opportunity of Montoni's abſence to mention <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

another apartment, and to inquire again, concerning the occaſion of their ſudden journey. On the firſt ſubject her aunt referred her to Montoni, poſitively refuſing to interfere in the affair; on the laſt, ſhe profeſſed utter ignorance.</p>
                     <p>Emily, then, with a wiſh of making her aunt more reconciled to her ſituation, praiſed the grandeur of the caſtle and the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding ſcenery, and endeavoured to ſoften every unpleaſing circumſtance attending it. But, though misfortune had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what conquered the aſperities of Madame Montoni's temper, and, by increaſing her cares for herſelf, had taught her to feel in ſome degree for others, the capricious love of rule, which nature had planted and habit had nouriſhed in her heart, was not ſubdued. She could not now deny herſelf the gratification of tyrannizing over the innocent and helpleſs Emily, by attempting to ridicule the taſte ſhe could not feel.</p>
                     <p>Her ſatirical diſcourſe was, however, interrupted by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of Montoni, and her countenance immediately aſſumed a mingled expreſſion of fear and reſentment, while he ſeated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at the breakfaſt table, as if unconſcious of there being any perſon but himſelf in the room.</p>
                     <p>"Emily, as ſhe obſerved him in ſilence, ſaw that his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance was darker and ſterner than uſual. "O could I know," ſaid ſhe to herſelf, "what paſſes in that mind; could I know the thoughts, that are known there, I ſhould no longer be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to this torturing ſuſpenſe!" Their breakfaſt paſſed in ſilence, till Emily ventured to requeſt, that another apartment might be allotted to her, and related the circumſtance which made her wiſh it.</p>
                     <p>"I have no time to attend theſe idle whims," ſaid Monto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, "that chamber was prepared for you, and you muſt reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with it. It is not probable, that any perſon would take the trouble of going to that remote ſtaircaſe, for the purpoſe of faſtening a door. If it was not faſtened, when you entered the chamber, the wind, perhaps, ſhook the door and made the bolts ſlide. But I know not why I ſhould undertake to account for ſo trifling an occurrence." This explanation was by no means ſatisfactory to Emily, who had obſerved, that the bolts were ruſted, and conſequently could not be thus eaſily moved; but ſhe forbore to ſay ſo, and repeated her requeſt.</p>
                     <p>"If you will not releaſe yourſelf from the ſlavery of theſe fears," ſaid Montoni, ſternly, "at leaſt forbear to torment other's by the mention of them. Conquer ſuch whims, and endeavour to ſtrengthen your mind. No exiſtence is more contemptible

                        </gap> he ſaid this, his eye glanced upon Madame Montoni, who coloured highly, but was ſtill ſilent. Emily, wounded and diſappointed, thought her fears were, in this inſtance, too reaſonable to deſerve ridicule, but, perceiving, that, however, they might oppreſs her, ſhe muſt endure them, ſhe tried to withdraw her attention from the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
                     <p>Carlo ſoon after entered with ſome fruit: "Your <hi>Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> is tired after your long ramble," ſaid he, as he ſet the fruit upon the table; "but you have more to ſee after breakfaſt. There is a place in the vaulted paſſage leading to"—</p>
                     <p>Montoni frowned upon him, and waved his hand for him to leave the room. Carlo ſtopped, looked down and then added, as he advanced to the breakfaſt table, and took up the baſket <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

of the country to be ſeen in ſuch various points of view, that they appeared to form new landſcapes. She often pauſed to examine the gothic magnificence of Udolpho, its proud irregular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, its lofty towers and battlements, its high arched, caſements, and its ſlender watch towers, perched upon the corners of turrets. Then ſhe would lean on the wall of the terrace, and, ſhuddering, meaſure with her eye the precipice below, till the dark ſummits of the woods arreſted it. Wherever ſhe turned, appeared moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain tops, foreſts of pine and narrow glens, opening among the Apennines and retiring from the ſight into inacceſſible regions.</p>
                     <p>While ſhe thus leaned, Montoni, followed by two men, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, aſcending a winding path, cut in the rock below. He ſtopped upon a cliff, and, pointing to the ramparts, turned to his followers, and talked with much eagerneſs of geſticulation.—Emily perceived that one of theſe men was Carlo; the other was in the dreſs of a peaſant, and he alone ſeemed to be receiving the directions of Montoni.</p>
                     <p>She withdrew from the walls, and purſued her walk, till ſhe heard at a diſtance the ſound of carriage wheels, and then the loud bell of the portal, when it inſtantly occurred to her, that Count Morano was arrived. As ſhe haſtily paſſed the folding doors from the terrace, towards her own apartment, ſeveral perſons entered the hall, by an oppoſite door. She ſaw them at the extremity of the arcades, and immediately retreated; but the agitation of her ſpirits, and the extent and duſkineſs of the hall, had prevented her from diſtinguiſhing the perſon of the ſtrangers. Her fears, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, had but one object, and they had called up that object to her fancy; ſhe believed that ſhe had ſeen Count Morano.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe thought that they had paſſed the hall, ſhe ventured again to the door, and proceeded, unobſerved, to her room, where ſhe remained, agitated with apprehenſions, and liſtening to every diſtant ſound. At length, hearing voices on the rampart ſhe haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened to her window, and obſerved Montoni with Signor Cavig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, walking below, converſing earneſtly, and often ſtopping and turning towards each other, at which times their diſcourſe ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be uncommonly intereſting.</p>
                     <p>Of the ſeveral perſons who had appeared in the hall, here was Cavigni alone: but Emily's alarm was ſoon after heightened by the ſteps of ſome one in the corridor, who, ſhe apprehended, brought a meſſage from the Count. In the next moment An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette appeared.</p>
                     <p>"Ah! ma'amſelle," ſaid ſhe, "here is the Signor Cavigni arrived! I am ſure I rejoiced to ſee a chriſtian perſon in this

                     <p>"O yes, quite ſure of that, ma'amſelle.

                     <p>"Ah—ma'amſelle!—how can one keep ſuch a ſecret as that?"</p>
                     <p>"Well, Annette, I am now ſo much better, that you may leave me."</p>
                     <p>"O, but, ma'amſelle, I forgot to aſk—how did you ſleep in this dreary old chamber laſt night?"—"As well as uſual."—"Did you hear no noiſes?"—"None."—"Nor ſee any thing?" "Nothing."—"Well, that is ſurpriſing!"—"Not in the leaſt: and now tell me, why you aſk theſe queſtions."</p>
                     <p>"O, ma'amſelle! I would not tell you for the world, nor all I have heard about this chamber, either; it would frighten you ſo?"</p>
                     <p>"If that is all, you have frightened me already, and may therefore tell me what you know, without hurting your conſcience."</p>
                     <p>"O Lord! they ſay the room is haunted, and has been ſo theſe many years."</p>
                     <p>"It is by a ghoſt, then, who can draw bolts," ſaid Emily, endeavouring to laugh away her apprehenſions; "for I left that door open, laſt night, and found it faſtened this morning."</p>

                     <p>"Do you know whether any of the ſervants faſtened this door in the morning before I roſe?"</p>

                     <p>"Stay, Annette, I have other queſtions to aſk; tell me what you have heard concerning this room, and whither that ſtaircaſe leads."</p>
                     <p>"I will go and aſk it all directly, ma'am; beſides I am ſure my lady wants me. I cannot ſtay now, indeed, ma'am."</p>
                     <p>She hurried from the room, without waiting Emily's reply, whoſe heart, lightened by the certainty, that Morano was not arrived, allowed her to ſmile at the ſuperſtitious terror, which had ſeized on Annette; for, though ſhe ſometimes felt its influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence herſelf, ſhe could ſmile at it, when apparent in other perſons.</p>
                     <p>Montoni having refuſed Emily another chamber, ſhe determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bear with patience the evil ſhe could not remove, are, in order to make the room as comfortable as poſſible, unpacked her books, her ſweet delight in happier days, and her ſoothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſourſe in the hours of moderate ſorrow: but, there were hours when
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:029378_0129_0FE081795947A248"/>
even theſe failed of their effect; when the genius, the taſte, the enthuſiaſm of the ſublimeſt writers were felt no longer.</p>
                     <p>Her little library being arranged on a high cheſt, part of the furniture of the room, ſhe took out her drawing utenſils, and was tranquil enough to be pleaſed with the thought of ſketching the ſublime ſcenes, beheld from her windows; but ſhe ſuddenly checked this pleaſure, remembering how often ſhe had ſoothed herſelf by the intention of obtaining amuſement of this kind, and had been prevented by ſome new circumſtance of misfortune.</p>
                     <p>"How can I ſuffer myſelf to be deluded by hope," ſaid ſhe, "and, becauſe Count Morano is not yet arrived, feel a momentary happineſs? Alas! what is it to me, whether he is here to-day, or to-morrow, if he comes at all?—and that he will come—it were weakneſs to doubt."</p>
                     <p>To withdraw her thoughts, however, from the ſubject of her misfortunes, ſhe attempted to read, but her attention wandered from the page, and, at length, ſhe threw aſide the book, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to explore the adjoining chambers of the caſtle. Her imagination was pleaſed with the view of ancient grandeur, and an emotion of melancholy awe awakened all its powers, as ſhe walked through rooms, obſcure and deſolate, where no foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps had paſſed probably for many years, and remembered the ſtrange hiſtory of the former poſſeſſor of the edifice. This brought to her recollection the veiled picture, which had attracted her curioſity, on the preceding night, and ſhe reſolved to exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine it. As ſhe paſſed through the chambers, that led to this, ſhe found herſelf ſomewhat agitated; its connection with the late lady of the caſtle, and the converſation of Annette, together with the circumſtance of the veil, throwing a myſtery over the ſubject, that excited a faint degree of terror. But a terror of this nature, as it occupies and expands the mind, and elevates it to high ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, is purely ſublime, and leads us, by a kind of facination, to ſeek even the object, from which we appear to ſhrink.</p>
                     <p>Emily paſſed on with faltering ſteps, and having pauſed a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the door, before ſhe attempted to open it, ſhe then haſtily entered the chamber, and went towards the picture, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be encloſed in a frame of uncommon ſize, that hung in a dark part of the room. She pauſed again, and then with a timid hand, lifted the veil; but inſtantly let it fall—perceiving that what it had concealed was no picture, and, before ſhe could leave the chamber, ſhe dropped ſenſeleſs on the floor.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe recovered her recollection, the remembrance of what ſhe had ſeen had nearly deprived her of it a ſecond time.
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:029378_0129_0FE081795947A248"/>
She had ſcarcely ſtrength to remove from the room, and regain her own; and, when arrived there, wanted courage to remain alone. Horror occupied her mind, and excluded, for a time, all ſenſe of paſt, and dread of future misfortune: ſhe ſeated her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf near the caſement, becauſe from thence ſhe heard voices, though diſtant, on the terrace, and might ſee people paſs, and theſe, trifling as they were, were reviving circumſtances. When her ſpirits had recovered their tone, ſhe conſidered, whether ſhe ſhould mention what ſhe had ſeen to Madame Montoni, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and important motives urged her to do ſo, among which the leaſt was the hope of the relief, which an overburdened mind finds in ſpeaking of the ſubject of its intereſt. But ſhe was aware of the terrible conſequences, which ſuch a communication might lead to; and, dreading the indiſcretion of her aunt, at length, endeavoured to arm herſelf with reſolution to obſerve a profound ſilence, on the ſubject. Montoni and Verezzi ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter paſſed under the caſement, ſpeaking cheerfully, and their voices revived her. Preſently the Signors Bertolini and Cavigni joined the party on the terrace, and Emily, ſuppoſing that Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ame Montoni was then alone, went to ſeek her; for the ſolitude of her chamber, and its proximity to that where ſhe had received ſo ſevere a ſhock, again affected her ſpirits.</p>
                     <p>She found her aunt in her dreſſing room, preparing for dinner. Emily's pale and affrighted countenance alarmed even Madame Montoni; but ſhe had ſufficient ſtrength of mind to be ſilent on the ſubject, that ſtill made her ſhudder, and which was ready to burſt from her lips. In her aunt's apartment ſhe remained, till they both deſcended to dinner. There ſhe met the gentlemen lately arrived, who had a kind of buſy ſeriouſneſs in their looks, which was ſomewhat unuſual with them, while their thoughts ſeemed too much occupied by ſome deep intereſt, to ſuffer them to beſtow much attention either on Emily, or Madame Montoni. They ſpoke little, and Montoni leſs. Emily, as ſhe now looked on him, ſhuddered. The horror of the chamber ruſhed on her mind. Several times the colour faded from her cheeks, and ſhe feared, that illneſs would betray her emotions, and compel her to leave the room; but the ſtrength of her reſolution remedied the weakneſs of her frame; ſhe obliged herſelf to converſe, and even tried to look cheerful.</p>
                     <p>Montoni evidently laboured under ſome vexation, ſuch as would probably have agitated a weaker mind, or a more ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible heart, but which appeared, from the ſternneſs of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, only to bend up his faculties to energy and fortitude.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="32" facs="unknown:029378_0130_0FE0817DE8105518"/>
It was a comfortleſs and ſilent meal. The gloom of the caſtle ſeemed to have ſpread its contagion even over the gay counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Cavigni, and with this gloom was mingled a fierceneſs, ſuch as ſhe had ſeldom ſeen him indicate. Count Morano was not named, and what converſation there was, turned chiefly upon the wars, which at that time agitated the Italian ſtates, the ſtrength of the Venetian armies, and the characters of their generals.</p>
                     <p>After dinner, when the ſervants had withdrawn, Emily learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the cavalier who had drawn upon himſelf the vengeance of Orſino, had ſince died of his wounds, and that ſtrict ſearch was ſtill making for his murderer. The intelligence ſeemed to diſturb Montoni, who muſed, and then inquired, where Orſino had concealed himſelf. His gueſts, who all, except Cavigni, were ignorant, that Montoni had himſelf aſſiſted him to eſcape from Venice, replied, that he had fled in the night with ſuch precipitation and ſecrecy, that his moſt intimate companions knew not whither. Montoni blamed himſelf for having aſked the queſtion, for a ſecond thought convinced him, that a man of Orſino's ſuſpicious temper was not likely to truſt any of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons preſent with the knowledge of his aſylum. He conſidered himſelf, however, as entitled to his utmoſt confidence, and did not doubt, that he ſhould ſoon hear of him.</p>
                     <p>Emily retired with Madame Montoni, ſoon after the cloth was withdrawn, and left the cavaliers to their ſecret councils, but not before the ſignificant frowns of Montoni had warned his wife to depart, who paſſed from the hall to the ramparts, and walked, for ſometime, in ſilence, which Emily did not interrupt, for her mind was alſo occupied by intereſts of its own. It required all her reſolution, to forbear communicating to Madame Montoni the terrible ſubject, which ſtill thrilled her every nerve with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; and ſometimes ſhe was on the point of doing ſo, merely to obtain the relief of a moment; but ſhe knew how wholly ſhe was in the power of Montoni, and, conſidering, that the indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of her aunt, might prove fatal to them both, ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled herſelf to endure a preſent and an inferior evil, rather than to tempt a future and a heavier one. A ſtrange kind of preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent frequently, on this day occurred to her;—it ſeemed as if her fate reſted here, and was by ſome inviſible means connected with this caſtle.</p>
                     <p>"Let me not accelerate it," ſaid ſhe to herſelf: "for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I may be reſerved, let me, at leaſt avoid ſelf reproach."</p>
                     <p>As ſhe looked on the maſſy walls of the edifice, her melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirits repreſented it to be her priſon; and ſhe ſtarted as at a
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:029378_0130_0FE0817DE8105518"/>
new ſuggeſtion, when ſhe conſidered how far diſtant ſhe was from her native country, from her little peaceful home, and from her only friend—how remote was her hope of happineſs, how feeble the expectation of again ſeeing him! Yet the idea of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt, and her confidence in his faithful love, had hitherto been her only ſolace, and ſhe ſtruggled hard to retain them. A few tears of agony ſtarted to her eyes, which ſhe turned aſide to conceal.</p>
                     <p>While ſhe afterwards leaned on the wall of the rampart, ſome peaſants, at a little diſtance, were ſeen examining a breach, before which lay a heap of ſtones, as if to repair it, and a ruſty old can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non that appeared to have fallen from its ſtation above. Madame Montoni ſtopped to ſpeak to the men, and inquired what they were going to do. "To repair the fortifications, your lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip," ſaid one of them; a labour which ſhe was ſomewhat ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, that Montoni ſhould think neceſſary, particularly ſince he had never ſpoken of the caſtle as of a place, at which he meant to reſide for any conſiderable time; but ſhe paſſed on towards a lofty, arch, that led from the ſouth to the eaſt rampart, and which adjoined the caſtle, on one ſide, while, on the other, it ſupported a ſmall watch-tower, that entirely commanded the deep valley below. As ſhe approached this arch, ſhe ſaw, beyond it, wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along the woody deſcent of a diſtant mountain, a long troop of horſe and foot, whom ſhe knew to be ſoldiers, only by the glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their pikes and other arms, for the diſtance did not allow her to to diſcover the colour of their liveries. As ſhe gazed, the vanguard iſſued from the woods into the valley, but the train ſtill continued to pour over the remote ſummit of the mountain, in endleſs ſucceſſion; while, in the front, the mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itary uniform became diſtinguiſhable, and the commanders, riding firſt, and ſeeming, by their geſtures, to direct the march of thoſe that followed, at length, approached very near to the caſtle.</p>
                     <p>Such a ſpectacle, in theſe ſolitary regions, both ſurpriſed and alarmed Madame Montoni, and ſhe haſtened towards ſome pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, who were employed in raiſing baſtions before the ſouth rampart, where the rock was leſs abrupt than elſewhere. Theſe men could give no ſatisfactory anſwers to her inquiries, but, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rouſed by them, gazed in ſtupid aſtoniſhment upon the long cavalcade. Madame Montoni then thinking it neceſſary to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate farther the ſubject of her alarm, ſent Emily to ſay, that ſhe wiſhed to ſpeak to Montoni; an errand her niece did not approve, for ſhe dreaded his frowns, which ſhe knew this meſſage would provoke; but ſhe obeyed in ſilence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="34" facs="unknown:029378_0131_0FE0818ADAA10058"/>
As ſhe drew near the apartment, in which he ſat with his gueſts, ſhe heard them in earneſt and loud diſpute, and ſhe pauſed a moment, trembling at the diſpleaſure, which her ſudden inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption would occaſion. In the next, their voices ſunk alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; ſhe then ventured to open the door, and, while Montoni turned haſtily and looked at her, without ſpeaking, ſhe delivered her meſſage.</p>
                     <p>"Tell Madam Montoni I am engaged," ſaid he.</p>
                     <p>Emily then thought it proper to mention the ſubject of her alarm. Montoni and his companions roſe inſtantly and went to the windows, but, theſe not affording them a view of the troops, they at length proceeded to the ramparts, where Cavigni conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured it to be a legion of <hi>Condottieri,</hi> on their march towards Modena.</p>
                     <p>One part of the cavalcade now extended along the valley, and another wound among the mountains towards the north, while ſome troops ſtill lingered on the woody precipices, where the firſt had appeared, ſo that the great length of the proceſſion ſeemed to include an whole army. While Montoni and his family watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its progreſs, they heard the ſound of trumpets and the claſh of cymbals in the vale, and then others, anſwering from the heights. Emily liſtened with emotion to the ſhrill blaſt, that woke the echoes of the mountains, and Montoni explained the ſignals, with which he appeared to be well acquainted, and which meant noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hoſtile. The uniforms of the troops, and the kind of arms they bore, confirmed to him the conjecture of Cavigni, and he had the ſatisfaction to ſee them paſs by, without even ſtopping to gaze upon his caſtle. He did not, however, leave the rampart, till the baſes of the mountains had ſhut them from his view, and the laſt murmur of the trumpet floated away on the wind. Cavigni and Verezzi were inſpirited by this ſpectacle, which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have rouſed all the fire of their temper; Montoni turned into the caſtle in thoughtful ſilence.</p>
                     <p>Emily's mind had not yet ſufficiently recovered from its late ſhock, to endure the lonelineſs of her chamber, and ſhe remained upon the ramparts; for Madame Montoni had not invited her to her dreſſing room, whither ſhe had gone evidently in low ſpirits, and Emily, from her late experience, had loſt all wiſh to explore the gloomy and myſterious receſſes of the caſtle. The ramparts, therefore, were almoſt her only retreat, and here ſhe lingered, till the gray haze of evening was again ſpread over the ſcene.</p>
                     <p>The cavaliers ſupped by themſelves, and Madame Montoni re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in her apartment, whither Emily went, before ſhe retired
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:029378_0131_0FE0818ADAA10058"/>
to her own. She found her aunt weeping, and in much agitation. The tenderneſs of Emily was naturally ſo ſoothing, that it ſeldom failed to give comfort to the drooping heart: but Madame Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni's was torn, and the ſofteſt accents of Emily's voice were loſt upon it. With her uſual delicacy, ſhe did not appear to obſerve her aunt's diſtreſs, but it gave an involuntary gentleneſs to her manners, and an air of ſolicitude to her countenance, which Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame Montoni was vexed to perceive, who ſeemed to feel the pity of her niece to be an inſult to her pride, and diſmiſſed her as ſoon as ſhe properly could. Emily did not venture to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion again the reluctance ſhe felt to her gloomy chamber, but ſhe requeſted that Annette might be permitted to remain with her till ſhe retired to reſt; and the requeſt was ſomewhat reluctantly granted. Annette, however, was now with the ſervants, and Emily withdrew alone.</p>
                     <p>With light and haſty ſteps ſhe paſſed through the long galleries, while the feeble glimmer of the lamp ſhe carried only ſhewed the gloom around her, and the paſſing air threatened to extinguiſh it. The lonely ſilence, that reigned in this part of the caſtle, awed her; now and then, indeed, ſhe heard a faint peal of laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter riſe from a remote part of the edifice, where the ſervants were aſſembled, but it was ſoon loſt, and a kind of breathleſs ſtillneſs remained. As ſhe paſſed the ſuite of rooms which ſhe had viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the morning, her eyes glanced fearfully on the door, and ſhe almoſt fancied ſhe heard murmuring ſounds within, but ſhe pauſed not a moment to inquire.</p>
                     <p>Having reached her own apartment, where no blazing wood on the hearth diſſipated the gloom, ſhe ſat down with a book, to enliven her attention, till Annette ſhuold come, and a fire could be kindled. She continued to read till her light was nearly expired, but An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette did not appear, and the ſolitude and obſcurity of her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber again affected her ſpirits, the more, becauſe of its nearneſs to the ſcene of horror, that ſhe had witneſſed in the morning. Gloomy and fantaſtic images came to her mind. She looked fearfully towards the door of the ſtaircaſe, and then, examining whether it was ſtill faſtened, found that it was ſo. Unable to conquer the uneaſineſs ſhe felt at the proſpect of ſleeping again in this remote and inſecure apartment, which ſome perſon ſeemed to have entered during the preceding night, her impatience to ſee Annette, whom ſhe had bidden to inquire concerning this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, became extremely painful. She wiſhed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> to queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion her, as to the object, which had excited ſo much horror in her own mind, and which Annette on the preceding evening had appeared to be in part acquainted with, though her words were
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:029378_0132_0FE081908B2F0980"/>
very remote from the truth, and it appeared plainly to Emily, that the girl had been purpoſely miſled by a falſe report: above all ſhe was ſurpriſed, that the door of the chamber, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it, ſhould be left unguarded. Such an inſtance of negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence almoſt ſurpaſſed belief. But her light was now expiring; the faint flaſhes it threw upon the walls called up all the terrors of fancy, and ſhe roſe to find her way to the habitable part of the caſtle, before it was quite extinguiſhed.</p>
                     <p>As ſhe opened the chamber door, ſhe heard remote voices, and, ſoon after, ſaw a light iſſue upon the further end of the corridor, which Annette and another ſervant approached. "I am glad you are come," ſaid Emily: "what has detained you ſo long? Pray light me a fire immediately."</p>
                     <p>"My lady wanted me, ma'amſelle," replied Annette in ſome confuſion; "I will go and get the wood."</p>
                     <p>"No," ſaid Caterina, "that is my buſineſs," and left the room inſtantly, while Annette would have followed; but, being called back, ſhe began to talk very loud, and, laugh, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed afraid to truſt a pauſe of ſilence.</p>
                     <p>Caterina ſoon returned with the wood, and then, when the cheerful blaze once more animated the room, and this ſervant had withdrawn, Emily aſked Annette, whether ſhe had made the inquiry ſhe bade her. "Yes, ma'amſelle," ſaid Annette, "but not a ſoul knows any thing about the matter: and old Carlo,—I watched him well, for they ſay he knows ſtrange things—old Carlo looked ſo as I don't know how to tell, and he aſked me again and again, if I was ſure the door was ever unfaſtened. Lord, ſays I—am I ſure I am alive? And as for me, ma'am I am all aſtounded, as one may ſay, and would no more ſleep in this chamber, than I would on the great cannon at the end of the eaſt rampart." "And what objection have you to that cannon; more than to any of the reſt?" ſaid Emily ſmiling: "the beſt would be rather a hard bed."</p>
                     <p>"Yes, ma'amſelle, any of them would be hard enough for that matter; but they do ſay, that ſomething has been ſeen in the dead of night, ſtanding beſide the great cannon as if to guard it."</p>
                     <p>"Well! my good Annette, the people who tell ſuch ſtories, are happy in having you for an auditor, for I perceive you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them all."</p>
                     <p>"Dear ma'amſelle! I will ſhew you the very cannon; you can ſee it from theſe windows!"</p>
                     <p>"Well" ſaid Emily, "but that does not prove, that an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition guards it."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="37" facs="unknown:029378_0132_0FE081908B2F0980"/>
"What! not if I ſhew you the very cannon! Dear ma'am, you will believe nothing."</p>
                     <p>"Nothing probably upon this ſubject, but what I ſee," ſaid Emily.—"Well, ma'am, but you ſhall ſee it, if you will only ſtep this way to the caſement."—Emily could not forbear laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Annette looked ſurpriſed. Perceiving her extreme ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to credit the marvellous, Emily forbore to mention the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſhe had intended, leſt it ſhould overcome her with ideal terrors, and ſhe began to ſpeak on a lively topic—the regattas of Venice.</p>
                     <p>"Aye, ma'amſelle, thoſe rowing matches," ſaid Annette, and the fine moonlight nights, are all, that are worth ſeeing in Venice. To be ſure that moon is brighter than any I ever ſaw; and then to hear ſuch ſweet muſic, too, as Ludovico has often and often ſong under the lattice by the weſt portico! Ma'am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle, it was Ludovico, that told me about that picture, which you wanted ſo to look at laſt night, and—"</p>
                     <p>"What picture?" ſaid Emily, wiſhing Annette to explain herſelf.</p>
                     <p>"O! that terrible picture with the black veil over it."</p>
                     <p>"You never ſaw it, then?" ſaid Emily.</p>
                     <p>"Who, I!—No, ma'amſelle, I never did. But this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing," continued Annette, lowering her voice, and looking round the room, "this morning, as it was broad daylight, do you know, ma'am, I took a ſtrange fancy to ſee it, as I had heard ſuch odd hints about it, and I got as far as the door, and ſhould have opened it, if it had not been locked!"</p>
                     <p>Emily endeavouring to conceal the emotion this circumſtance occaſioned, inquired at what hour ſhe went to the chamber, and found, that it was ſoon after herſelf had been there. She alſo aſked further queſtions, and the anſwers convinced her, that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette, and probably her informer, were ignorant of the terrible truth, though in Annette's account ſomething very like the truth, now and then, mingled with the falſehood. Emily now began to fear, that her viſit to the chamber had been obſerved, ſince the door had been cloſed, ſo immediately after her departure; and dreaded leſt this ſhould draw upon her the vengeance of Monto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni. Her anxiety, alſo was excited, to know whence, and for what purpoſe, the deluſive report, which had been impoſed upon Annette, had originated, ſince Montoni could only have wiſhed for ſilence and ſecrecy; but ſhe felt, that the ſubject was too ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible for this lonely hour, and ſhe compelled herſelf to leave it, to converſe with Annette, whoſe chat, ſimple as it was, ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the ſtillneſs of total ſolitude.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="38" facs="unknown:029378_0133_0FE0819DC2043C40"/>
Thus they ſat, till near midnight, but not without many hints from Annette, that ſhe wiſhed to go. The embers were now nearly burnt out; and Emily heard, at a diſtance, the thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſound of the hall doors, as they were ſhut for the night. She, therefore, prepared for reſt, but was ſtill unwilling that Annette ſhould leave her. At this inſtant, the great bell of the portal ſounded. They liſtened in fearful expectation, when, after a long pauſe of ſilence, it ſounded again. Soon after, they heard the noiſe of carriage wheels in the court yard. Emily ſunk al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt lifeleſs in her chair; "It is the Count," ſaid ſhe.</p>
                     <p>"What, at this time of night, ma'am!" ſaid Annette: "no, my dear lady. But, for that matter, it is a ſtrange time of night for any body to come!"</p>
                     <p>"Nay, pr'ythee, good Annette, ſtay not talking," ſaid Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a voice of agony—"Go, pr'ythee, go, and ſee who it is."</p>
                     <p>Annette left the room, and carried with her the light, leaving Emily in darkneſs, which a few moments before would have ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified her in this room, but was now ſcarcely obſerved by her. She liſtened and waited, in breathleſs expectation, and heard diſtant noiſes, but Annette did not return. Her patience, at length, exhauſted, ſhe tried to find her way to the corridor, but it was long before ſhe could touch the door of the chamber, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when ſhe had opened it, the total darkneſs without made her fear to proceed. Voices were now heard, and Emily even thought ſhe diſtinguiſhed thoſe of Count Morano, and Montoni. Soon after, ſhe heard ſteps approaching, and then a ray of light ſtream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the darkneſs, and Annette appeared, whom Emily went to meet.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, ma'amſelle," ſaid ſhe, "you was right, it is the Count ſure enough."</p>
                     <p>"It is he!" exclaimed Emily, lifting her eyes towards heaven and ſupporting herſelf by Annette's arm.</p>
                     <p>"Good Lord! my dear lady, don't be in ſuch a <hi>fluſter,</hi> and look ſo pale, we ſhall ſoon hear more."</p>
                     <p>"We ſhall, indeed!" ſaid Emily, moving as faſt as ſhe was able towards her apartment. "I am not well; give me air."—Annette opened a caſement, and brought water. The faintneſs ſoon left Emily, but ſhe deſired Annette would not go till ſhe heard from Montoni.</p>
                     <p>"Dear ma'amſelle! he ſurely will not diſturb you at this time of night; why, he muſt think you are aſleep."</p>
                     <p>"Stay with me till I am ſo, then," ſaid Emily, who felt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary relief from this ſuggeſtion, which appeared probable
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:029378_0133_0FE0819DC2043C40"/>
enough, though her fears had prevented its occurring to her. Annette, with ſecret reluctance, conſented to ſtay, and Emily was now compoſed enough to aſk her ſome queſtions; among others, whether ſhe had ſeen the Count.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, ma'am, I ſaw him alight, for I went from hence to the grate in the north turret, that overlooks the inner court yard, you know. There I ſaw the Count's carriage, and the Count in it, waiting at the great door,—for the porter was juſt gone to bed—with ſeveral men on horſeback all by the light of the torches they carried."—Emily was compelled to ſmile. "When the door was opened, the Count ſaid ſomething that I could not make out, and then got out, and another gentleman with him. I thought, to be ſure, the Signor was gone to bed, and I haſtened away to my lady's dreſſing room, to ſee what I could hear. But in the way I met Ludovico, and he told me that the Signor was up, counſelling with his maſter and the other Signors, in the room at the end of the north gallery; and Ludovico held up his finger, and laid it on his lips, as much as to ſay—There is more go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, than you think of, Annette, but you muſt hold your tongue. And ſo I did hold my tongue, ma'amſelle, and came away to tell you directly."</p>
                     <p>Emily inquired who the cavalier was, that accompanied the Count, and how Montoni received them; but Annette could not inform her.</p>
                     <p>"Ludovico," ſhe added, "has juſt been to call Signor Montoni's valet, that he might tell him they were arrived, when I met him."</p>
                     <p>Emily ſat muſing, for ſometime, and then her anxiety was ſo much increaſed, that ſhe deſired Annette would go to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants' hall, where it was poſſible ſhe might hear ſomething of the Count's intention, reſpecting his ſtay at the caſtle.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, ma'am," ſaid Annette with readineſs; "but how am I to find the way, if I leave the lamp with you?"</p>
                     <p>Emily ſaid ſhe would light her, and they immediately quitted the chamber. When they had reached the top of the great ſtaircaſe, Emily recollected, that ſhe might be ſeen by the Count, and, to avoid the great hall, Annette conducted her through ſome private paſſages to a back ſtaircaſe, which led directly to that of the ſervants.</p>
                     <p>As ſhe returned towards her chamber, Emily began to fear, that ſhe might again loſe herſelf in the intricacies of the caſtle, and again be ſhocked by ſome myſterious ſpectacle; and, though ſhe was already perplexed by the numerous turnings, ſhe feared
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:029378_0134_0FE081A28B28C408"/>
to open one of the many doors, that offered. While ſhe ſtepped thoughtfully along, ſhe fancied, that ſhe heard a low moaning at no great diſtance, and, having pauſed a moment, ſhe heard it again and diſtinctly. Several doors appeared on the right hand of the paſſage. She advanced, and liſtened. When ſhe came to the ſecond, ſhe heard a voice, apparently in complaint, within, to which ſhe continued to liſten, afraid to open the door, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to leave it. Convulſive ſobs followed, and then the piercing accents of an agonizing ſpirit burſt forth. Emily ſtood appalled, and looked through the gloom that ſurrounded her, in fearful expectation. The lamentations continued. Pity now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſubdue terror; it was poſſible ſhe might adminiſter comfort to the ſufferer, at leaſt by expreſſing ſympathy, and ſhe laid her hand on the door. While ſhe heſitated ſhe thought ſhe knew this voice, diſguiſed as it was by tones of grief. Having, therefore, ſet down the lamp in the paſſage, ſhe gently opened the door, within which all was dark, except that from an inner apartment a partial light ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; and ſhe ſtepped ſoftly on. Before ſhe reached it, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Madame Montoni, leaning on her dreſſing table, weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and with a handkerchief held to her eyes, ſtruck her, and ſhe pauſed.</p>
                     <p>Some perſon was ſeated in a chair by the fire, but who it was ſhe could not diſtinguiſh. He ſpoke, now and then, in a low voice, that did not allow Emily to hear what was uttered, but ſhe thought, that Madame Montoni, at thoſe times, wept the more, who was too much occupied by her own diſtreſs, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Emily, while the latter, though anxious to know what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned this, and who was the perſon admitted at ſo late an hour to her aunt's dreſſing room, forbore to add to her ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings by ſurpriſing her, or to take advantage of her ſituation, by liſtening to a private diſcourſe. She, therefore, ſtepped ſoftly back, and, after, ſome further difficulty, found the way to her own chamber, where nearer intereſts, at length, excluded the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe and concern ſhe had felt, reſpecting Madame Montoni.</p>
                     <p>Annette, however, returned without ſatisfactory intelligence, for the ſervants, among whom ſhe had been, were either entirely ignorant, or affected to be ſo, concerning the Count's intended ſtay at the caſtle. They could talk only of the ſteep and broken road they had juſt paſſed, and of the numerous dangers they had eſcaped, and expreſs wonder how their lord could chooſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter all theſe in the darkneſs of night; for they ſcarcely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, that the torches had ſerved for any other purpoſe but that of ſhewing the drearineſs of the mountains. Annette, finding
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:029378_0134_0FE081A28B28C408"/>
ſhe could gain no information, left them, making noiſy petitions, for more wood on the fire and more ſupper on the table.</p>
                     <p>"And now, ma'amſelle," added ſhe, "I am ſo ſleepy!—I am ſure, if you was ſo ſleepy, you would not deſire me to ſit up with you."</p>
                     <p>Emily, indeed, began to think it was cruel to wiſh it; ſhe had alſo waited ſo long, without receiving a ſummons from Montoni, that it appeared he did not mean to diſturb her, at this late hour, and ſhe determined to diſmiſs Annette. But, when ſhe again looked round her gloomy chamber, and recollected cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain circumſtances, fear ſeized her ſpirits and ſhe heſitated.</p>
                     <p>"And yet it were cruel of me to aſk you to ſtay, till I am aſleep, Annette," ſaid ſhe, "for I fear it will be very long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I forget myſelf in ſleep."</p>
                     <p>"I dare ſay it will be very long, ma'amſelle," ſaid Annette.</p>
                     <p>"But, before you go," rejoined Emily, "let me aſk you—Had Signor Montoni left Count Morano, when you quitted the hall?"</p>
                     <p>"O no, ma'am, they were alone together."</p>
                     <p>"Have you been in my aunt's dreſſing room, ſince you left me?"</p>
                     <p>"No ma'amſelle, I called at the door as I paſſed, but it was faſtened; ſo I thought my lady was gone to bed."</p>
                     <p>"Who, then, was with your lady juſt now?" ſaid Emily, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting in ſurpriſe, her uſual prudence.</p>
                     <p>"Nobody, I believe, ma'am," replied Annette, "nobody has been with her, I believe, ſince I left you."</p>
                     <p>Emily took no further notice of the ſubject, and, after ſome ſtruggle with imaginary fears, her good nature prevailed over them ſo far, that ſhe diſmiſſed Annette for the night. She then ſat, muſing upon her own circumſtances and thoſe of Madame Montoni, till her eye reſted on the miniature picture, which ſhe had found, after her father's death, among the papers he had enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to deſtroy. It was open upon the table, before her, among ſome looſe drawings, having, with them, been taken out of a little box by Emily, ſome hours before. The ſight of it called up many intereſting reflections, but the melancholy ſweetneſs of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance ſoothed the emotions, which theſe had occaſioned. It was the ſame ſtyle of countenance as that of her late father, and, while ſhe gazed on it with fondneſs on this account, ſhe even fancied a reſemblance in the features. But this tranquillity was ſuddenly interrupted, when ſhe recollected the words in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſcript, that had been found with this picture, and which had
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:029378_0135_0FE081AF9636F360"/>
formerly occaſioned her ſo much doubt and horror. At length, ſhe rouſed herſelf from the deep reverie, into which this remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance had thrown her; but, when ſhe roſe to undreſs, the ſilence and ſolitude, to which ſhe was left, at this midnight hour, for not even a diſtant ſound was now heard, conſpired with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion the ſubject ſhe had been conſidering had given to her mind, to appall her. Annette's hints, too, concerning this cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſimple as they were, had not failed to affect her, ſince they followed a circumſtance of peculiar horror, which ſhe herſelf had witneſſed, and ſince the ſcene of this was a chamber nearly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining her own.</p>
                     <p>The door of the ſtaircaſe, was, perhaps, a ſubject of more reaſonable alarm, and ſhe now began to apprehend, ſuch was the aptitude of her fears, that this ſtaircaſe had ſome private com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with the apartment, which ſhe ſhuddered even to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member. Determined not to undreſs, ſhe lay down to ſleep in her clothes, with her late father's dog, the faithful <hi>Manchon,</hi> at the foot of the bed, whom ſhe conſidered as a kind of guard.</p>
                     <p>Thus circumſtanced, ſhe tried to baniſh reflection, but her buſy fancy would ſtill hover over the ſubjects of her intereſt, and ſhe heard the clock of the caſtle ſtrike two, before ſhe cloſed her eyes.</p>
                     <p>From the diſturbed ſlumber, into which ſhe then ſunk, ſhe was ſoon awakened by a noiſe, which ſeemed to ariſe within her chamber; but the ſilence, that prevailed, as ſhe fearfully liſtened, inclined her to believe, that ſhe had been alarmed by ſuch ſounds as ſometimes occur in dreams, and ſhe laid her head again upon the pillow.</p>
                     <p>A return of the noiſe again diſturbed her; it ſeemed to come from that part of the room, which communicated with the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſtaircaſe, and ſhe inſtantly remembered the odd circumſtance of the door having been faſtened, during the preceding night, by ſome unknown hand. Her late alarming ſuſpicion, concerning its communication, alſo occurred to her. Her heart became faint with terror. Half raiſing herſelf from the bed, and gently drawing aſide the curtain, ſhe looked towards the door of the ſtaircaſe, but the lamp, that burnt on the hearth, ſpread ſo feeble a light through the apartment, that the remote parts of it were loſt in ſhadow. The noiſe, however, which, ſhe was convinced, came from the door, continued. It ſeemed like that made by the undrawing of ruſty bolts, and often ceaſed, and was then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed more gently, as if the hand, that occaſioned it, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by a fear of diſcovery. While Emily kept her eyes
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:029378_0135_0FE081AF9636F360"/>
fixed on the ſpot, ſhe ſaw the door move, and then ſlowly open, and perceived ſomething enter the room, but the extreme duſki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs prevented her diſtinguiſhing what it was. Almoſt fainting with terror, ſhe had yet ſufficient command over herſelf, to check the ſhriek, that was eſcaping from her lips, and letting the curtain drop from her hand, continued to obſerve in ſilence the motions of the myſterious form ſhe ſaw. It ſeemed to glide along the remote obſcurity of the apartment, then pauſed, and, as it approached the hearth, ſhe perceived, in the ſtronger light, what appeared to be a human figure. Certain remembrances now ſtruck upon her heart, and almoſt ſubdued the feeble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of her ſpirits; ſhe continued, however, to watch the figure, which remained for ſometime motionleſs, but then, advancing ſlowly towards the bed, ſtood ſilently at the feet, where the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, being a little open, allowed her ſtill to ſee it; terror, however, had now deprived her of the power of diſcrimination, as well as that of utterance.</p>
                     <p>Having continued there a moment, the form retreated towards the hearth, when it took the lamp, held it up, ſurveyed the chamber, for a few moments, and then again advanced towards the bed. The light at that inſtant awakening the dog, that had ſlept at Emily's feet, he barked loudly, and, jumping to the floor, flew at the ſtranger, who ſtruck the animal ſmartly with a ſheathed ſword, and, ſpringing towards the bed, Emily diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered—Count Morano!</p>
                     <p>She gazed at him for a moment in ſpeechleſs affright, while he, throwing himſelf on his knee at the bed ſide, beſought her to fear nothing, and, having thrown down his ſword, would have taken her hand, when the faculties, that terror had ſuſpended, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly returned, and ſhe ſprung from the bed, in the dreſs, which ſurely a kind of prophetic apprehenſion had prevented her, on this night, from throwing aſide.</p>
                     <p>Morano roſe, followed her to the door, through which he had entered, and caught her hand, as ſhe reached the top of the ſtair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe, but not before ſhe had diſcovered, by the gleam of a lamp, another man half way down the ſteps. She now ſcreamed in deſpair, and, believing herſelf given up by Montoni, ſaw, indeed, no poſſibility of eſcape.</p>
                     <p>The Count, who ſtill held her hand, led her back into the chamber.</p>
                     <p>"Why all this terror?" ſaid he, in a tremulous voice.—"Hear me, Emily: I come not to alarm you; no, by Heaven! I love you too well—too well for my own peace."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="44" facs="unknown:029378_0136_0FE081B46B2359A8"/>
Emily looked at him for a moment, in fearful doubt.</p>
                     <p>"Then leave me ſir," ſaid ſhe, "leave me inſtantly."</p>
                     <p>"Hear me, Emily," reſumed Morano; "hear me! I love, and am in deſpair—yes—in deſpair. How can I gaze upon you, and know, that it is, perhaps, for the laſt time, without ſuffering all the phrenſy of deſpair? But it ſhall not be ſo; you ſhall be mine, in ſpite of Montoni and all his villainy."</p>
                     <p>"In ſpite of Montoni!" cried Emily eagerly: "what is it I hear?"</p>
                     <p>"You hear, that Montoni is a villain," exclaimed Morano with vehemence,—"a villain who would have ſold you to my love!—Who—"</p>
                     <p>"And is he leſs who would have bought me?" ſaid Emily, fixing on the Count an eye of calm contempt. "Leave the room, ſir, inſtantly," ſhe continued in a voice, trembling between joy and fear, "or I will alarm the family, and you may receive that from Signor Montoni's vengeance, which I have vainly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated from his pity." But Emily knew, that ſhe was beyond the hearing of thoſe, who might protect her.</p>
                     <p>"You can never hope any thing from his pity," ſaid Morano, "he has uſed me infamouſly, and my vengeance ſhall purſue him. And for you, Emily, for you, he has new plans more profitable than the laſt, no doubt." The gleam of hope, which the Count's former ſpeech had revived, was now nearly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the latter; and, while Emily's countenance betrayed the emotions of her mind, he endeavoured to take advantage of the diſcovery.</p>
                     <p>"I loſe time," ſaid he: "I came not to exclaim againſt Montoni; I came to ſolicit, to plead—to Emily; to tell her all I ſuffer, to entreat her to ſave me from deſpair, and her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from deſtruction. Emily! the ſchemes of Montoni are in-ſearchable, but I warn you, they are terrible; he has no princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when intereſt, or ambition leads. Can I love you, and abandon you to his power? Fly, then, fly from this gloomy pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, with a lover, who adores you! I have bribed a ſervant of the caſtle to open the gates, and, before to-morrow's dawn, you ſhall be far on the way to Venice."</p>
                     <p>Emily, overcome by the ſudden ſhock ſhe had received, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> the moment, too, when ſhe had begun to hope for better days, now thought ſhe ſaw deſtruction ſurround her on every ſide. Unable to reply, and almoſt to think, ſhe threw herſelf into a chair, pale and breathleſs. That Montoni had formerly ſold her to Morano, was very probable; that he had now withdraws,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:029378_0136_0FE081B46B2359A8"/>
his conſent to the marriage, was evident from the Count's preſent conduct; and it was nearly certain, that a ſcheme of ſtronger intereſt only could have induced the ſelfiſh Montoni to forego a plan, which he had hitherto ſo ſtrenuouſly purſued. Theſe reflections made her tremble at the hints, which Morano had juſt given, which ſhe no longer heſitated to believe; and while ſhe ſhrunk from the new ſcenes of miſery and oppreſſion, that might await her in the caſtle of Udolpho, ſhe was compelled to obſerve, that almoſt her only means of eſcaping them was by ſubmitting herſelf to the protection of this man, with whom evils more certain and not leſs terrible appeared,—evils, upon which ſhe could not endure to pauſe for an inſtant.</p>
                     <p>Her ſilence, though it was that of agony, encouraged the hopes of Morano, who watched her countenance with impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, took again the reſiſting hand ſhe had withdrawn, and, as he preſſed it to his heart, again conjured her to determine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately. "Every moment we loſe, will make our departure more dangerous," ſaid he: "theſe few moments loſt may enable Montoni to overtake us."</p>
                     <p>"I beſeech, you, ſir, be ſilent," ſaid Emily faintly: "I am indeed very wretched, and wretched I muſt remain. Leave me—I command you, leave me to my fate."</p>
                     <p>"Never!" cried the Count vehemently: "let me periſh firſt! But forgive my violence! the thought of loſing you is madneſs. You cannot be ignorant of Montoni's character, you may be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of his ſchemes—nay, you muſt be ſo, or you would not heſitate between my love and his power."</p>
                     <p>"Nor do I heſitate," ſaid Emily.</p>
                     <p>"Let us go, then," ſaid Morano, eagerly kiſſing her hand, and riſing, "my carriage waits, below the caſtle walls."</p>
                     <p>"You miſtake me, ſir," ſaid Emily. "Allow me to thank you for the intereſt you expreſs in my welfare, and to decide by my own choice. I ſhall remain under the protection of Signor Montoni."</p>
                     <p>"Under his protection!" exclaimed Morano, proudly, "his <hi>protection!</hi> Emily, why will you ſuffer yourſelf to be thus delud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? I have already told you what you have to expect from his <hi>protection."</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>"And pardon me, ſir, if, in this inſtance, I doubt mere aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and, to be convinced, require ſomething approaching to proof."</p>
                     <p>"I have now neither the time, or the means of adducing proof," replied the Count.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="46" facs="unknown:029378_0137_0FE081C0200065E8"/>
"Nor have I, ſir, the inclination to liſten to it, if you had."</p>
                     <p>"But you trifle with my patience and my diſtreſs," continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Morano. "Is a marriage with a man, who adores you, ſo very terrible in your eyes, that you would prefer it to all the miſery, to which Montoni may condemn you in this remote pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? Some wretch muſt have ſtolen thoſe affections, which ought to be mine, or you could not thus obſtinately perſiſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing an offer, that would place you beyond the reach of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion." Morano walked about the room, with quick ſteps, and a diſturbed air.</p>
                     <p>"This diſcourſe, Count Morano, ſufficiently proves, that my affections ought not to be yours," ſaid Emily, mildly, "and this conduct, that I ſhould not be placed beyond the reach of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſo long as I remained in your power. If you wiſh me to believe otherwiſe, ceaſe to oppreſs me any longer by your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. If you refuſe this, you will compel me to expoſe you to the reſentment of Signor Montoni."</p>
                     <p>"Yes, let him come," cried Morano furiouſly, "and brave <hi>my</hi> reſentment! Let him dare to face once more the man he has ſo courageouſly injured; danger ſhall teach him morality, and vengeance juſtice—let him come, and receive my ſword in his heart!"</p>
                     <p>The vehemence, with which this was uttered, gave Emily new cauſe of alarm, who aroſe from her chair, but her trembling frame refuſed to ſupport her, and ſhe reſumed her ſeat;—the words died on her lips, and, when ſhe looked wiſtfully towards the door of the corridor, which was locked, ſhe conſidered it was impoſſible for her to leave the apartment, before Morano would be appriſed of, and able to counteract, her intention.</p>
                     <p>Without obſerving her agitation, he continued to pace the room in the utmoſt perturbation of ſpirits. His darkened coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance expreſſed all the rage of jealouſy and revenge; and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who had ſeen his features under the ſmile of ineffable tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which he ſo lately aſſumed, would now ſcarcely have believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to be the ſame.</p>
                     <p>"Count Morano," ſaid Emily, at length recovering her voice, "calm, I entreat you, theſe tranſports, and liſten to reaſon, if you will not to pity. You have equally miſplaced your love and your hatred. I never could have returned the affection, with which you honour me, and certainly have never encouraged it; neither has Signor Montoni injured you, for you muſt have known, that he had no right to diſpoſe of my hand, had he even poſſeſſed the power to do ſo, Leave, then, leave the caſtle,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:029378_0137_0FE081C0200065E8"/>
while you may with ſafety. Spare yourſelf the dreadful conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of an unjuſt revenge, and the remorſe of having prolong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me theſe moments of ſuffering."</p>
                     <p>"Is it for mine, or for Montoni's ſafety that you are thus alarmed?" ſaid Morano, coldly, and turning towards her with a look of acrimony.</p>
                     <p>"For both," replied Emily in a trembling voice.</p>
                     <p>"Unjuſt revenge!" cried the Count, reſuming the abrupt tones of paſſion. "Who that looks upon that face, can imagine a puniſhment adequate to the injury he would have done me? Yes, I will leave the caſtle; but it ſhall not be alone. I have trifled too long. Since my prayers and my ſufferings cannot prevail, force ſhall. I have people in waiting, who ſhall convey you to my carriage. Your voice will bring no ſuccour; it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be heard from this remote part of the caſtle; ſubmit, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in ſilence to go with me."</p>
                     <p>This was an unneceſſary injunction, at preſent; for Emily was too certain, that her call would avail her nothing; and terror had ſo entirely diſordered her thoughts, that ſhe knew not how to plead to Morano, but ſat, mute and trembling, in her chair, till he advanced to lift her from it, when ſhe ſuddenly raiſed her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and with a repulſive geſture, and a countenance of forced ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity, ſaid, "Count Morano! I am now in your power; but you will obſerve, that this is not the conduct which can win the eſteem you appear ſo ſolicitous to obtain, and that you are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for yourſelf a load of remorſe, in the miſeries of a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs orphan, which can never leave you. Do you believe your heart to be, indeed, ſo hardened, that you can look without emotion on the ſuffering, to which you would condemn me?"—</p>
                     <p>Emily was interrupted by the growling of the dog, who now came again from the bed, and Morano looked towards the door of the ſtaircaſe, where no perſon appearing, he called aloud, "Ceſario!"</p>
                     <p>"Emily," ſaid the Count, "why will you reduce me to adopt this conduct? How much more willingly would I perſuade, than compel you to become my wife! but, by Heaven! I will not leave you to be ſold by Montoni. Yet a thought glances acroſs my mind, that brings madneſs with it.—I know not how to name it. It is prepoſterous—it cannot be.—Yet you tremble—you grow pale! It is! it is ſo;—you—you—love Montoni!" cried Morano, graſping Emily's wriſt, and ſtamping his foot on the floor.</p>
                     <p>An involuntary air of ſurpriſe appeared on her countenance. "If you have indeed believed ſo," ſaid ſhe, "believe ſo ſtill."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="48" facs="unknown:029378_0138_0FE081C4B5A11488"/>
"That look, thoſe words confirm it," exclaimed Morano, fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly. "No, no, no, Montoni had a richer prize in view, than gold. But he ſhall not live to triumph over me!—This very inſtant—"</p>
                     <p>He was interrupted by the loud barking of the dog.</p>
                     <p>"Stay, Count Morano," ſaid Emily, terrified by his words, and by the fury expreſſed in his eyes, "I will ſave you from this error.—Of all men, Signor Montoni is not your rival; though, if I find all other means of ſaving myſelf vain, I will try whether my voice may not arouſe his ſervants to my ſuccour."</p>
                     <p>"Aſſertion," replied Morano, "at ſuch a moment, is not to be depended upon. How could I ſuffer myſelf to doubt, even for an inſtant, that he could ſee you, and not love?—But my firſt care ſhall be to convey you from the caſtle. Ceſario! ho,—Ceſario!"</p>
                     <p>A man now appeared at the door of the ſtaircaſe, and other ſteps were heard aſcending. Emily uttered a loud ſhriek, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhe heard a noiſe at the door, that opened upon the corri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor. The Count pauſed an inſtant, as if his mind was ſuſpended between love and the deſire of vengeance; and, in that inſtant, the door gave way, and Montoni, followed by the old ſteward and ſeveral other perſons, burſt into the room.</p>
                     <p>"Draw!" cried Montoni to the Count, who did not pauſe for a ſecond bidding, but, giving Emily into the hands of the people, that appeared from the ſtaircaſe, turned fiercely round. "This is thine heart, villain!" ſaid he, as he made a thruſt at Montoni with his ſword, who parried the blow, and aimed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, while ſome of the perſons, who had followed him into the room, endeavoured to part the combatants, and others reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Emily from the hands of Morano's ſervants.</p>
                     <p>"Was it for this, Count Morano," ſaid Montoni, in a cool ſarcaſtic tone of voice, "that I received you under my roof, and permitted you, though my declared enemy, to remain under it for the night? Was it, that you might repay my hoſpitality with the treachery of a fiend, and rob me of my niece?"</p>
                     <p>"Who talks of treachery?" ſaid Morano, in a tone of unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained vehemence. "Let him that does, ſhew an unbluſhing face of innocence. Montoni, you are a villain! If there is treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery in this affair, look to yourſelf as the author of it. <hi>If</hi>—do I ſay? <hi>I</hi> whom you have wronged with unexampled baſeneſs, whom you have injured almoſt beyond redreſs! But why do I uſe words?—Come on, coward, and receive juſtice at my hands!"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="49" facs="unknown:029378_0138_0FE081C4B5A11488"/>
"Coward!" cried Montoni, burſting from the people who held him, and ruſhing on the Count, when they both retreated into the corridor, where the fight continued ſo deſperately, that none of the ſpectator's dared approach them, Montoni ſwearing that the firſt, who interfered, ſhould fall by his ſword.</p>
                     <p>Jealouſy and revenge lent all their fury to Morano, while the ſuperior ſkill and the temperance of Montoni enabled him to wound his adverſary, whom his ſervants now attempted to ſeize, but he would not be reſtrained, and, regardleſs of his wound, continued to fight. He ſeemed to be inſenſible both of pain and loſs of blood, and alive only to the energy of his paſſions. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni on the contrary, perſevered in the combat, with a fierce, yet weary valour; he received the point of Morano's ſword on his arm, but, almoſt in the ſame inſtant, ſeverely wounded and diſarmed him. The Count then fell back into the arms of his ſervant, while Montoni held his ſword over him, and bade him aſk his life. Morano, ſinking under the anguiſh of his wound, had ſcarcely replied by a geſture, and by a few words, feebly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulated, that he would not—when he fainted; and Montoni was then going to have plunged the ſword into his breaſt, as he lay ſenſeleſs, but his arm was arreſted by Cavigni. To the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption he yielded without much difficulty, but his complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion changed almoſt to blackneſs, as he looked upon his fallen ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, and ordered that he ſhould be carried inſtantly from the caſtle.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, Emily, who had been withheld from leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

But Montoni, who had ſeldom liſtened to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, now ſeemed rapacious of vengeance, and, with a monſter's cruelty, again ordered his defeated enemy to be taken from the caſtle, in his preſent ſtate, though there were only the woods, or a ſolitary neighbouring cottage, to ſhelter him from the night.</p>
                     <p>The Count's ſervants having declared that they would not move him till he revived, Montoni's ſtood inactive, Cavigni re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrating, and Emily, ſuperior to Montoni's menaces, giving water to Morano, and directing the attendants to bind up his wound. At length Montoni had leiſure to feel pain from his own hurt, and he withdrew to examine it.</p>
                     <p>The Count, meanwhile, having ſlowly recovered, the firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject he ſaw, on raiſing his eyes, was Emily, bending over him

with a countenance ſtrongly expreſſive of ſolicitude. He ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed her with a look of anguiſh.</p>

                     <p>Ceſario propoſed to go out, and inquire for a cottage, that might receive his maſter, before he attempted to remove him: but Morano was impatient to be gone; the anguiſh of his mind ſeemed to be even greater than that of his wound, and he rejected, with diſdain, the offer of Cavigni to entreat Montoni, that he might be ſuffered to paſs the night in the caſtle. Ceſario was now going to call up the carriage to the great gate, but the Count forbade him. "I cannot bear the motion of a carriage," ſaid he: "call ſome others of my people, that they may aſſiſt in bearing me in their arms."</p>
                     <p>At length, however, Morano ſubmitted to reaſon and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, that Ceſario ſhould firſt prepare ſome cottage to receive him. Emily, now that he had recovered his ſenſes, was about to withdraw from the corridor, when a meſſage came from Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni commanded her to do ſo, and alſo that the Count if he was not already gone, ſhould quit the caſtle immediately. Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion flaſhed from Morano's eyes, and fluſhed his cheeks.</p>
                     <p>"Tell Montoni," ſaid he, "that I ſhall go when it ſuits my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"Count Morano! do you know what you ſay?" ſaid Cavigni.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, Signor, I know well what I ſay, and he will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand well what I mean. His conſcience will aſſiſt his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, on this occaſion."</p>
                     <p>"Count Morano," ſaid Verezzi, who had hitherto ſilently obſerved him, "dare again to inſult my friend, and I will plunge this ſword in your body."</p>
                     <p>"It would be an action worthy the friend of a villain!" ſaid Morano, as the ſtrong impulſe of his indignation enabled him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni's people, meanwhile, held Verezzi, who ſeemed inclined, even in this inſtant, to execute his threat; and Cavigni, who was not ſo depraved as to abet the cowardly malignity of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rezzi, endeavoured to withdraw him from the corridor; and Emily, whom a compaſſionate intereſt had thus long detained, was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"I am going from hence for ever" ſaid he: "perhaps, I ſhall never ſee you again. I would carry with me your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, Emily, nay more—I would carry your good wiſhes."</p>
                     <p>"You have my forgiveneſs, then," ſaid Emily, "and my ſincere wiſhes for your recovery."</p>
                     <p>"And only for my recovery?" ſaid Morano, with a ſigh. "For your general welfare," added Emily.</p>
                     <p>"Perhaps I ought to be contented with this," he reſumed; "I certainly have not deſerved more: but I would aſk you, Emily, ſometimes to think of me, and, forgetting my offence, to remember only the paſſion which occaſioned it. I would aſk, alas! impoſſibilities: I would aſk, you to love me! At this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when I am about to part with you, and that, perhaps, for ever, I am ſcarcely myſelf. Emily—may you never know the torture of a paſſion like mine! What do I ſay? O, that, for me, you might be ſenſible of ſuch a paſſion!"</p>
                     <p>Emily looked impatient to be gone. "I entreat you, Count, to conſult your own ſafety," ſaid ſhe, "and linger here no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. I tremble for the conſequences of Signor Verezzi's paſſion, and of Montoni's reſentment, ſhould he learn that you are ſtill here."</p>
                     <p>Morano's face was overſpread with a momentary crimſon, his eyes ſparkled, but he ſeemed endeavouring to conquer his emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and replied in a calm voice, "Since you are intereſted for my ſafety, I will regard it, and be gone. But, before I go, let me again hear you ſay, that you wiſh me well," ſaid he, fixing on her an earneſt and mournful look.</p>
                     <p>Emily repeated her aſſurances. He took her hand, which ſhe ſcarcely attempted to withdraw, and put it to his lips. "Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel, Count Morano!" ſaid Emily; and ſhe turned to go, when a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> meſſage arrived from Montoni, and ſhe again conjured
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:029378_0140_0FE081D4A03E3238"/>
Morano, as he valued his life, to quit the caſtle immediately. He regarded her in ſilence, with a look of fixed deſpair. But ſhe had no time to enforce her compaſſionate entreaties, and not during to diſobey the ſecond command of Montoni, ſhe left the corridor to attend him.</p>
                     <p>He was in the cedar parlour, that adjoined the great hall, laid upon a couch, and ſuffering a degree of anguiſh from his wound, which few perſons could have diſguiſed, as he did. His coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, which was ſtern, but calm, expreſſed the dark paſſion of revenge, but no ſymptom of pain; bodily pain, indeed, he had always deſpiſed, and had yielded only to the ſtrong and terrible energies of the ſoul. He was attended by old Carlo and by Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Bertolini, but Madame Montoni was not with him.</p>
                     <p>Emily trembled, as ſhe approached and received his ſevere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, for not having obeyed his firſt ſummons; and perceived, alſo, that he attributed her ſtay in the corridor to a motive, that had not even occurred to her artleſs mind.</p>
                     <p>"This is an inſtance of female caprice," ſaid he, "which I ought to have foreſeen. Count Morano, whoſe ſuit you obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately rejected, ſo long as it was countenanced by me, you fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, it ſeems, ſince you find I have diſmiſſed him."</p>
                     <p>Emily looked aſtoniſhed. "I do not comprehend you, ſir," ſaid ſhe: "You certainly do not mean to imply, that the deſign of the Count to viſit the double-chamber, was founded upon any approbation of mine."</p>
                     <p>"To that I reply nothing," ſaid Montoni; "but it muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be a more than common intereſt, that made you plead ſo warmly in his cauſe, and that could detain you thus long in his preſence, contrary to my expreſs order—in the preſence of a man, whom you have hitherto, on all occaſions, moſt ſcrupulouſly ſhunned!"</p>
                     <p>"I fear, ſir, it was a more than common intereſt, that detained me," ſaid Emily calmly; "for of late I have been inclined to think, that of compaſſion is an uncommon one. But how could I, could <hi>you</hi> ſir, witneſs Count Morano's deplorable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not wiſh to relieve it?"</p>
                     <p>"You add hypocriſy to caprice," ſaid Montoni, frowning, "and an attempt at ſatire, to both; but, before you undertake to regulate the morals of other perſons, you ſhould learn and practice the virtues, which are indiſpenſable to a woman—ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, uniformity of conduct and obedience."</p>
                     <p>Emily, who had always endeavoured to regulate her conduct by the niceſt laws, and whoſe mind was finely ſenſible, not only
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:029378_0140_0FE081D4A03E3238"/>
of what is juſt in morals, but of whatever is beautiful in the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male character, was ſhocked by theſe words; yet, in the next moment, her heart ſwelled with the conſciouſneſs of having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved praiſe, inſtead of cenſure, and ſhe was proudly ſilent. Montoni, acquainted with the delicacy of her mind, knew how keenly ſhe would feel his rebuke; but he was a ſtranger to the luxury of conſcious worth, and, therefore, did not foreſee the energy of that ſentiment, which now repelled his ſatire. Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> a ſervant who had lately entered the room, he aſked whether Morano had quitted the caſtle. The man anſwered, that his ſervants were then removing him, on a couch, to a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring cottage. Montoni ſeemed ſomewhat appeaſed, on hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this; and, when Ludovico appeared, a few moments after, and ſaid, that Morano was gone, he told Emily ſhe might retire to her apartment.</p>
                     <p>She withdrew willingly from his preſence; but the thought of paſſing the remainder of the night in a chamber, which the door from the ſtaircaſe made liable to the intruſion of any perſon, now alarmed her more than ever, and ſhe determined to call at Madame Montoni's room, and requeſt, that Annette might be permitted to be with her.</p>
                     <p>On reaching the great gallery, ſhe heard voices ſeemingly in diſpute, and, her ſpirits now apt to take alarm, ſhe pauſed, but ſoon diſtinguiſhed ſome words of Cavigni and Verezzi, and went towards them, in the hope of conciliating their difference. They were alone. Verezzi's face was ſtill fluſhed with rage; and, as the firſt object of it was now removed from him, he appeared willing to transfer his reſentment to Cavigni, who ſeemed to be expoſtulating, rather than diſputing, with him.</p>
                     <p>Verezzi was proteſting, that he would inſtantly inform Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni of the inſult, which Morano had thrown out againſt him, and above all, that, wherein he had accuſed him of murder.</p>
                     <p>"There is no anſwering," ſaid Cavigni, "for the words of a man in a paſſion; little ſerious regard ought to be paid to them. If you perſiſt in your reſolution, the conſequences may be fatal to both. We have now more ſerious intereſts to purſue, than thoſe of a petty revenge."</p>
                     <p>Emily joined her entreaties to Cavigni's arguments, and they, at length, prevailed ſo far, as that Verezzi conſented to retire, without ſeeing Montoni.</p>
                     <p>On calling at her aunt's apartment, ſhe found it faſtened. In a few minutes, however, it was opened by Madame Montoni herſelf.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="54" facs="unknown:029378_0141_0FE081E2015771E0"/>
It may be remembered, that it was by a door leading into the bed room from a back paſſage, that Emily had ſecretly entered a few hours preceding. She now conjectured, by the calmneſs of Madame Montoni's air, that ſhe was not appriſed of the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, which had befallen her huſband, and was beginning to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form her of it, in the tendereſt manner ſhe could, when her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Emily knew indeed, that ſhe had little reaſon to love Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni, but could ſcarcely have believed her capable of ſuch perfect apathy, as ſhe now diſcovered towards him; having obtained permiſſion, however, for Annette to ſleep in her chamber, ſhe went thither immediately.</p>
                     <p>A track of blood appeared along the corridor, leading to it; and on the ſpot, where the Count and Montoni had fought, the whole floor was ſtained. Emily ſhuddered, and leaned on Annette, as ſhe paſſed. When ſhe reached her apartment, ſhe inſtantly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, ſince the door of the ſtaircaſe had been left open, and that Annette was now with her, to explore whither it led,—a circumſtance now materially connected with her own ſafety.—Annette accordingly, half curious and half afraid, propoſed to deſcend the ſtairs; but on approaching the door, they perceived that it was already faſtened without, and their care was then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the ſecuring it on the inſide alſo, by placing againſt it as much of the heavy furniture of the room, as they could li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

ſilence and ſolitary air of the portico, where Montoni's lacquey's uſually loitered; but ſurpriſe was ſoon changed to aſtoniſhment, and aſtoniſhment to the rage of diſappointment, when the door was opened by an old woman, who told his ſervants, that her maſter and his family had left Venice, early in the morning, for <hi>Terrafirma.</hi> Scarcely believing what his ſervants told, he left his gondola, and ruſhed into the hall to inquire further. The old woman, who was the only perſon left in care of the manſion, perſiſted in her ſtory, which the ſilent and deſerted apartments ſoon convinced him was no fiction. He then ſeized her with a menacing air, as if he meant to wreak all his vengeance upon her, at the ſame time aſking her twenty queſtions in a breath, and all theſe with a geſticulation ſo furious, that ſhe was deprived of the power of anſwering them; then ſuddenly letting her go, he ſtamped about the hall, like a madman, curſing Montoni and his own folly.</p>
                     <p>When the good woman was at liberty, and had ſomewhat recovered from her fright, ſhe told him all ſhe knew of the affair, which, was, indeed, very little, but enough to enable Morano to diſcover, that Montoni was gone to his caſtle on the Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine. Thither he followed as ſoon as his ſervants could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete the neceſſary preparation for the journey, accompanied by a friend, and attended by a number of his people, determined to obtain Emily or a full revenge on Montoni. When his mind had recovered from the firſt efferveſcence of rage, and his thoughts became leſs obſcured, his conſcience hinted to him certain cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, which, in ſome meaſure, explained the conduct of Montoni: but how the latter could have been led to ſuſpect an intention, which, he had believed, was known only to himſelf, he could not even gueſs. On this occaſion, however, he had been partly betrayed by that ſympathetic intelligence, which may be ſaid to exiſt between bad minds, and which teaches one man to judge what another will do in the ſame circumſtances. Thus it was with Montoni, who had now received indiſputable proof of a truth, which he had ſometime ſuſpected—that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rano's circumſtances, inſtead of being affluent, as he had been bidden to believe, were greatly involved. Montoni had been intereſted in his ſuit, by motives entirely ſelfiſh, thoſe of avarice and pride; the laſt of which would have been gratified by an alliance with a Venetian nobleman, the former by Emily's eſtate in Gaſcony, which he had ſtipulated, as the price of his favour, ſhould be delivered up to him from the day of her marriage.—In the meantime, he had been led to ſuſpect, the conſequence of
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:029378_0142_0FE081E6D42A5E68"/>
the Count's boundleſs extravagance; but it was not till the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, preceding the intended nuptials, that he obtained certain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of his diſtreſſed circumſtances. He did not heſitate then to infer, that Morano deſigned to defraud him of Emily's eſtate; and in this ſuppoſition he was confirmed, and with apparent reaſon, by the ſubſequent conduct of the Count, who, after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appointed to meet him on that night, for the purpoſe of ſigning the inſtrument, which was to ſecure to him his reward, failed in his engagement. Such a circumſtance, indeed, in a man of Morano's gay and thoughtleſs character, and at a time when his mind was engaged by the buſtle of preparation for his nuptials, might have been attributed to a cauſe leſs deciſive, than deſign; but Montoni did not heſitate an inſtant to interpret in his own way, and after vainly waiting the Count's arrival, for ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral hours, he gave orders for his people to be in readineſs to ſet off at a moment's notice. By haſtening to Udolpho he intended to remove Emily from the reach of Morano, as well as to break off the affair, without ſubmitting himſelf to uſeleſs altercation: and, if the Count meant what he called honourably, he would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs follow Emily, and ſign the writings in queſtion. If this was done, ſo little conſideration had Montoni for her welfare, that he would not have ſcrupled to ſacrifice her to a man of ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fortune, ſince by that means he could enrich himſelf; and he forebore to mention to her the motive of his ſudden journey leſt the hope it might revive ſhould render her more intractable, when ſubmiſſion would be required.</p>
                     <p>With theſe conſiderations, he had left Venice; and, with others totally different, Morano had, ſoon after, purſued his ſteps acroſs the rugged Apennines. When his arrival was announced at the caſtle, Montoni did not believe, that he would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to ſhew himſelf, unleſs he had meant to fulfil his engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and he, therefore, readily admitted him; but the enraged countenance and expreſſions of Morano, as he entered the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, inſtantly undeceived him; and, when Montoni had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, in part, the motives of his abrupt departure from Venice, the Count ſtill perſiſted in demanding Emily, and reproaching Montoni, without even naming the former ſtipulation.</p>
                     <p>Montoni, at length, weary of the diſpute, deferred the ſettling of it till the morrow, and Morano retired with ſome hope, ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted by Montoni's apparent indeciſion. When, however, in the ſilence of his own apartment, he began to conſider the paſt converſation, the character of Montoni, and ſome former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his duplicity, the hope, which he had admitted, van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:029378_0142_0FE081E6D42A5E68"/>
and he determined not to neglect the preſent poſſibility of obtaining Emily by other means. To his confidential val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et he told his deſign of carrying away Emily, and ſent him back to Montoni's ſervants to find out one among them, who might enable him to execute it. The choice of this perſon he entruſted to the fellow's own diſcernment, and not imprudently; for he diſcovered a man, whom Montoni had, on ſome former occaſion, treated harſhly, and who was now ready to betray him. This man conducted Ceſario round the caſtle, through a private paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, to the ſtaircaſe, that led to Emily's chamber; then ſhewed him a ſhort way out of the building, and afterwards procured him the keys, that would ſecure his retreat. The man was well rewarded for his trouble; how the Count was rewarded for his treachery has already appeared.</p>
                     <p>Meanwhile, old Carlo had overheard two of Morano's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, who had been ordered to be in waiting with the carriage, beyond the caſtle walls, expreſſing their ſurpriſe at their maſter's ſudden, and ſecret departure, for the valet had entruſted them with no more of Morano's deſigns, than it was neceſſary for them to execute. They, however, indulged themſelves in ſurmiſes, and in expreſſing them to each other; and from theſe Carlo had drawn a juſt concluſion. But, before he ventured to diſcloſe his apprehenſions to Montoni, he endeavoured to obtain further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of them, and, for this purpoſe, placed himſelf, with one of his fellow ſervants, at the door of Emily's apartment, that opened upon the corridor. He did not watch long in vain, though the growling of the dog had once nearly betrayed him. When he was convinced, that Morano was in the room, and had liſtened long enough to his converſation, to underſtand his ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>me, he immediately alarmed Montoni, and thus reſcued Emily from the deſigns of the Count.</p>
                     <p>Montoni, on the following morning, appeared as uſual, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that he wore his wounded arm in a ſling; he went out upon the ramparts; overlooked the men employed in repairing them gave orders for additional workmen, and then came into the caſtle to give audience to ſeveral perſons, who were juſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, and who were ſhewn into a private apartment, where he communicated with them, for near an hour. Carlo was then ſummoned, and ordered to conduct the ſtrangers to a part of the caſtle, which, in former times, had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> occupied by the upper ſervants of the family, and to provide them with every neceſſary refreſhment.—When he had done this, he was bidden to return to his maſter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="58" facs="unknown:029378_0143_0FE081F528D87F48"/>
Meanwhile, the Count remained in a cottage in the ſkirts of the woods below, ſuffering under bodily and mental pain, and meditating deep revenge againſt Montoni. His ſervant, whom he had diſpatched for a ſurgeon to the neareſt town, which was, however, at a conſiderable diſtance, did not return till the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing day, when, his wounds being examined and dreſſed, the practitioner refuſed to deliver any poſitive opinion, concerning the degree of danger attending them; but, giving his patient a compoſing draught and ordering him to be kept quiet, remained at the cottage to watch the event.</p>
                     <p>Emily, for the remainder of the late eventful night, had been ſuffered to ſleep, undiſturbed; and, when her mind recovered from the confuſion of ſlumber, and ſhe remembered, that ſhe was now releaſed from the addreſſes of Count Morano, her ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its were ſuddenly relieved from a part of the terrible anxiety, that had long oppreſſed them; that which remained, aroſe chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from a recollection of Morano's aſſertions, concerning the ſchemes of Montoni. He had ſaid, that plans of the latter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Emily, were inſearchable, yet that he knew them to be terrible. At the time he uttered this, ſhe almoſt believed it to be deſigned for the purpoſe of prevailing with her to throw her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into his protection, and ſhe ſtill thought it might be chiefly ſo accounted for; but his aſſertions had left an impreſſion on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> mind, which a conſideration of that character and former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Montoni did not contribute to efface. She, however, checked her propenſity to anticipate evil; and, determined to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy this reſpite from actual misfortune, tried to diſmiſs thought, took her inſtruments for drawing, and placed herſelf at a window, to ſelect into a landſcape ſome features of the ſcenery without.</p>
                     <p>As ſhe was thus employed, ſhe ſaw, walking on the rampart below, the men, who had ſo lately arrived at the caſtle. The ſight of ſtrangers ſurpriſed her, but ſtill more, of ſtrangers ſuch as theſe. There was a ſingularity in their dreſs, and a certain fierceneſs in their air, that fixed all her attention. She withdrew from the caſement, while they paſſed, but ſoon returned to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them further. Their figures ſeemed ſo well ſuited to the wildneſs of the ſurrounding objects, that, as they ſtood ſurveying the caſtle, ſhe ſketched them for banditti, amid the mountain-view of her picture, when ſhe had finiſhed which, ſhe was ſurpriſed to obſerve the ſpirit of her group. But ſhe had copied from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>Carlo, when he had placed refreſhment before theſe men in the apartment aſſigned to them, returned, as he was ordered, to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:029378_0143_0FE081F528D87F48"/>
who was anxious to diſcover by what ſervant the keys of the caſtle had been delivered to Morano, on the preceding night. But this man, though he was too faithful to his maſter quietly to ſee him injured, would not betray a fellow ſervant even to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; he, therefore pretended to be ignorant who it was, that had conſpired with Count Morano, and related, as before, that he had only overheard ſome of the ſtrangers deſcribing the plot.</p>
                     <p>Montoni's ſuſpicions naturally fell upon the porter, whom he ordered now to attend. Carlo heſitated, and then with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> ſteps went to ſeek him.</p>
                     <p>Barnardine, the porter, denied the accuſation with a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſo ſteady and undaunted, that Montoni could ſcarcely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him guilty, though he knew not how to think him inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. At length, the man was diſmiſſed from his preſence, and, though the real offender, eſcaped detection.</p>
                     <p>Montoni then went to his wife's apartment, whither Emily followed ſoon after, but, finding them in high diſpute, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly leaving the room, when her aunt called her back, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired her to ſtay.—"You ſhall be a witneſs," ſaid ſhe, "of my oppoſition. Now, ſir, repeat the command, I have ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to obey."</p>
                     <p>Montoni turned, with a ſtern countenance, to Emily, and bade her quit the apartment, while his wife perſiſted in deſiring, that ſhe would ſtay. Emily was eager to eſcape from this ſcene of contention, and anxious, alſo, to ſerve her aunt; but ſhe deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of conciliating Montoni, in whoſe eyes the riſing tempeſt of his ſoul flaſhed terribly.</p>
                     <p>"Leave the room," ſaid he, in a voice of thunder. Emily obeyed, and, walking down to the rampart, which the ſtrangers had now left, continued to meditate on the unhappy marriage of her father's ſiſter, and on her own deſolate ſituation, occaſioned by the ridiculous imprudence of her, whom ſhe had always wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to reſpect and love. Madame Montoni's conduct had, indeed, rendered it impoſſible for Emily to do either; but her gentle heart was touched by her diſtreſs, and, in the pity thus awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhe forgot the injurious treatment ſhe had received from her.</p>
                     <p>As ſhe ſauntered on the rampart, Annette appeared at the hall door, looked cautiouſly round, and then advanced to meet her.</p>
                     <p>"Dear ma'amſelle, I have been looking for you all over the caſtle," ſaid ſhe. "If you will ſtep this way, I will ſhew you a picture."</p>
                     <p>"A picture!" exclaimed Emily, and ſhuddered.</p>

                     <p>"Yes, Annette, you love the wonderful; but do you know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that, unleſs you guard againſt this inclination, it will lead you into all the miſery of ſuperſtition?"</p>
                     <p>Annette might have ſmiled in her turn, at this ſage obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Emily, who could tremble with ideal terrors, as much as herſelf, and liſten almoſt as eagerly to the recital of a myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſtory. Annette urged her requeſt.</p>
                     <p>"Are you ſure it is a picture?" ſaid Emily, "Have you ſeen it?—Is it veiled!"</p>
                     <p>"Holy Maria! ma'amſelle, yes, no, yes. I am ſure it is a picture—I have ſeen it and it is not veiled!"</p>
                     <p>The tone and look of ſurpriſe, with which this was uttered, recalled Emily's prudence; who concealed her emotion under a ſmile, and bade Annette lead her to the picture. It was in as obſcure chamber, adjoining that part of the caſtle, allotted to the ſervants. Several other portraits hung on the walls, cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, like this, with duſt and cobweb.</p>
                     <p>"That is it ma'amſelle," ſaid Annette, in a low voice, and pointing. Emily advanced, and ſurveyed the picture. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented a lady in the flower of youth and beauty; her fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were handſome and noble, full of ſtrong expreſſion, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="61" facs="unknown:029378_0144_0FE081F9C1719930"/>
and ſtill leſs of the penſive mildneſs ſhe loved. It was a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, which ſpoke the language of paſſion, rather than that of ſentiment; a haughty impatience of misfortune—not the placid melancholy of a ſpirit injured, yet reſigned.</p>
                     <p>"How many years have paſſed, ſince this lady diſappeared, Annette?" ſaid Emlly.</p>
                     <p>"Twenty years, ma'amſelle, or thereabout, as they tell me; I know it is a long while ago." Emily continued to gaze upon the portrait.</p>
                     <p>"I think," reſumed Annette, "the Signor would do well to hang i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But he may have good reaſons for what he does: and ſome people do ſay, that he has loſt his riches, as well as his gratitude. But huſh, ma'am, not a word!" added Annette, laying her finger on her lips. Emily was too much abſorbed in thought, to hear what ſhe ſaid.</p>
                     <p>"'Tis a handſome lady, I am ſure," continued Annette: "the Signor need not be aſhamed to put her in the great apartment where the veiled picture hangs." Emily turned round. "But for that matter, ſhe would be as little ſeen there, as here, for the door is always locked, I find."</p>
                     <p>"Let us leave this chamber," ſaid Emily: "and let me cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you again, Annette; be guarded in your converſation, and never tell, that you know any thing of that picture."</p>
                     <p>"Holy mother" exclaimed Annette, "it is no ſecret; why all the ſervants have ſeen i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Emily ſtarted. "How is this?" ſaid ſhe—"Have ſeen it! When? how?"</p>
                     <p>"Dear, ma'amſelle, there is nothing ſurpriſing in that; we had all a little more <hi>curiouſneſs</hi> than you had."</p>
                     <p>"I thought you told me, the door was kept locked?" ſaid Emily.</p>
                     <p>"If that was the caſe, ma'amſelle," replied Annette, looking about her, "how could we get here?"</p>
                     <p>"O! you mean <hi>this</hi> picture," ſaid Emily, with returning calmneſs. "Well, Annette, here is nothing more to engage my attention; we will go."</p>
                     <p>Emily, as ſhe paſſed to her own apartment, ſaw Montoni go down to the hall, and ſhe turned into her aunt's dreſſing room, whom ſhe found weeping and alone, grief and reſentment ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling on her countenance.

Judging of Emily's diſpoſition from her own, and from a conſciouſneſs of what her treatment of her deſerved, ſhe had believed, that her griefs would be cauſe of triumph to her niece, rather than of ſymthathy; that ſhe would deſpiſe, not pity her. But ſhe knew not the tenderneſs and benevolence of Emily's heart, that had always taught her to forget her own injuries in the misfortunes of her enemy. The ſufferings of others, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they might be, called forth her ready compaſſion, which diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated at once every obſcuring cloud to goodneſs, that paſſion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

"Dear Madam, be compoſed," ſaid Emily; "the Signor may not be ſo rich as you had reaſon to expect, but ſurely he cannot be very poor, ſince this caſtle and the manſion at Venice are his. May I aſk what are the circumſtances, that particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affect you?"</p>
                     <p>"What are the circumſtances?" exclaimed Madame Monto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni with reſentment: "why is it not ſufficient, that he had long ago ruined his own fortune by play, and that he has ſince loſt what I brought him—and that now he would compel me to ſign away my ſettlement (it was well I had the chief of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty ſettled on myſelf!) that he may loſe this alſo, or throw it away in wild ſchemes, which nobody can underſtand but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? And, and—is not all this ſufficient?"</p>
                     <p>"It is, indeed," ſaid Emily, "but you muſt recollect, dear madam, that I knew nothing of all this."</p>
                     <p>"Well, and is it not ſufficient," rejoined her aunt, "that he is alſo abſolutely ruined, that he is ſunk deeply in debt, and that neither this caſtle, or the manſion at Venice, is his own, if all his debts, honourable and diſhonourable, were paid!"</p>
                     <p>"I am ſhocked by what you tell me, madam," ſaid Emily.</p>
                     <p>"And is it not enough," interrupted Madame Montoni, "that he has treated me with neglect, with cruelty, becauſe I refuſed to relinquiſh my ſettlements, and, inſtead of being frightened by his menaces, reſolutely defied him, and upbraided him with his ſhameful conduct? But I bore all meekly,—you know, niece, I never uttered a word of complaint, till now; no! That ſuch a diſpoſition as mine ſhould be ſo impoſed upon! That I, whoſe only faults are too much kindneſs, too much generoſity, ſhould be chained for life to ſuch a vile, deceitful, cruel monſter!"</p>
                     <p>Want of breath compelled Madame Montoni to ſtop. If any thing could have made Emily ſmile in theſe moments, it would have been this ſpeech of her aunt, delivered in a voice very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle below a ſcream, and with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Emily ſaw, that her misfortunes did not admit of real conſolation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning the common place terms of ſuperficial comfort, ſhe was ſilent; while Madame Montoni, jealous of her own conſequence, miſtook this for the ſilence of indifference, or of contempt, and reproached her with want of duty and feeling.</p>
                     <p>"O! I ſuſpected what all this boaſted ſenſibility would prove to be!" rejoined ſhe; "I thought it would not teach you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

"Pardon me, madam," ſaid Emily mildly, "it is not natural to me to boaſt, and if it was, I am ſure I would not boaſt of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility—a quality, perhaps, more to be feared, than deſired."</p>
                     <p>"Well, well, niece, I will not diſpute with you. But, as I ſaid, Montoni threatens me with violence, if I any longer refuſe to ſign away my ſettlements, and this was the ſubject of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, when you came into the room before.

                     <p>"I do not care," replied Madame Montoni, "it does not ſignify: I will not ſubmit to ſuch uſage. You would have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"You ſpoke of reproaching the Signor,"—ſaid Emily, with heſitation. "Why, does he not deſerve reproaches?" ſaid her aunt.</p>
                     <p>"Certainly he does; but will it be prudent in you, madam, to make them?"</p>
                     <p>"Prudent!" exclaimed Madame Montoni. "Is this a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"Of prudence!" continued Madame Montoni, without at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to her, "of prudence towards a man, who does not ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to break all the common ties of humanity in his conduct to me! And is it for me to conſider prudence in my behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him! I am not ſo mean."</p>
                     <p>"It is for your own ſake, not for the Signor's madam," ſaid Emily modeſtly, "that you ſhould conſult prudence. Your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, however juſt, cannot puniſh him, but they may provoke him to further violence againſt you."</p>
                     <p>"What! would you have me ſubmit, then, to whatever he commands—would you have me kneel down at his feet and thank him for his cruelties? Would you have me give up my ſettlements?"</p>

"How much you miſtake me, madam!" ſaid Emily, "I am unequal to adviſe you on a point ſo important as the laſt: but you will pardon me for ſaying, that, if you conſult your own peace, you will try to conciliate Signor Montoni, rather than to irritate him by reproaches."</p>
                     <p>"Conciliate indeed! I tell you, niece, it is utterly impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; I diſdain to attempt it."</p>
                     <p>Emily was ſhocked to obſerve the perverted underſtanding and obſtinate temper of Madame Montoni; but, not leſs grieved for her ſufferings, ſhe looked round for ſome alleviating circumſtance to offer her. "Your ſituation is, perhaps, not ſo deſperate, dear madam," ſaid Emily, "as you may imagine. The Signor may repreſent his affairs to be worſe than they are, for the purpoſe of pleading a ſtronger neceſſity for his poſſeſſion of your ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Beſides, ſo long as you keep this, you may look forward to it as a reſource, at leaſt, that will afford you a competence, ſhould the Signor's future conduct compel you to ſue for ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion."</p>
                     <p>Madame Montoni impatiently interrupted her. "Unfeeling, cruel girl!" ſaid ſhe, "and ſo you would perſuade me, that I have no reaſon to complain; that the Signor is in very flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing circumſtances, that my future proſpects promiſe nothing but comfort, and that my griefs are as fanciful and romantic as your own! is it the way to conſole me, to endeavour to perſuade me out of my ſenſes and my feelings, becauſe you happen to have no feelings yourſelf? I thought I was opening my heart to a perſon, who could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

                     <p>Emily, without replying, immediately left the room, with a mingled emotion of pity and contempt, and haſtened to her own, where ſhe yielded to the mournful reflections, which a knowledge of her aunt's ſituation had occaſioned. The converſation of the Italian with Valancourt, in France, again oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to her. His hints, reſpecting the broken fortunes of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni, were now completely juſtified: thoſe, alſo, concerning his character, appeared not leſs ſo, though the particular circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, connected with his fame, to which the ſtranger had alluded, yet, remained to be explained. Notwithſtanding, that her own obſervations and the words of Count Morano had convinced her, that Montoni's ſituation was not what it formerly appeared to be, the intelligence ſhe had juſt received from her aunt on this point ſtruck her with all the force of aſtoniſhment, which was
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:029378_0147_0FE0821B800CAA30"/>
not weakened, when ſhe conſidered the preſent ſtyle of Montoni's living, the number of ſervants he maintained, and the new ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes he was incurring, by repairing and fortifying his caſtle.—Her anxiety for her aunt and for herſelf increaſed with reflection. Several aſſertions of Morano, which, on the preceding night, ſhe had believed were prompted either by intereſt, or by reſentment, now returned to her mind with the ſtrength of truth. She could not doubt, that Montoni had formerly agreed to give her to the Count, for a pecuniary reward; his character, and his diſtreſſed circumſtances juſtified the belief; theſe, alſo, ſeemed to confirm Morano's aſſertion, that he now deſigned to diſpoſe of her, more advantageouſly for himſelf, to a richer ſuitor.</p>
                     <p>Amidſt the reproaches, which Morano had thrown out againſt Montoni, he had ſaid—he would not quit the caſtle <hi>he dared to call his,</hi> nor willingly leave <hi>another</hi> murder on his conſcience—hints, which might have no other origin than the paſſion of the moment: but Emily was now inclined to account for the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> more ſeriouſly, and ſhe ſhuddered to think, that ſhe was in the hands of a man, to whom it was even poſſible they could apply. At length, conſidering, that reflection could neither releaſe her from her melancholy ſituation, or enable her to bear it with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er fortitude, ſhe tried to divert her anxiety, and took do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> from her little library a volume of her favourite Arioſto; but his wild imagery and rich invention could not long enchant her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; his ſpells did not reach her heart, and over her ſleeping fancy they played, without awakening it.</p>
                     <p>She now put aſide the book, and took her lute, for it was ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that her ſufferings refuſed to yield to the magic of ſweet ſounds; when they did ſo, ſhe was oppreſſed by ſorrow, that came from exceſs of tenderneſs and regret; and there were times, when muſic had increaſed ſuch ſorrow to a degree, that was ſcarcely endurable; when, if it had not ſuddenly ceaſed, ſhe might have loſt her reaſon. Such was the time, when ſhe mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for her father, and heard the midnight ſtrains, that floated by her window near the convent in Languedoc, on the night that followed his death.</p>
                     <p>She continued to play, till Annette brought dinner into her chamber, at which Emily was ſurpriſed, and inquired whoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> ſhe obeyed. "My lady's, ma'amſelle," replied Annette "the Signor ordered her dinner to be carried to her own apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo ſhe has ſent you yours. There have been ſad do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings between them, worſe than ever, I think."</p>
                     <p>Emily, not appearing to notice what ſhe ſaid, ſat down to the little table, that was ſpread for her. But Annette was not to be
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:029378_0147_0FE0821B800CAA30"/>
ſilenced thus eaſily. While ſhe waited, ſhe told of the arrival of the men, whom Emily had obſerved on the ramparts, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed much ſurpriſe at their ſtrange appearance, as well as at the manner, in which they had been attended by Montoni's or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. "Do they dine with the Signor, then?" ſaid Emily.</p>
                     <p>"No, ma'amſelle, they dined long ago, in an apartment at the north end of the caſtle, but I know not when they are to go, for the Signor told old Carlo to ſee them provided with every thing neceſſary. They have been walking all about the caſtle, and aſking queſtions of the workmen on the ramparts. I never ſaw ſuch ſtrange looking men in my life; I am frightened when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I ſee them."</p>
                     <p>Emily inquired, if ſhe had heard of Count Morano, and wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he was likely to recover: but Annette only knew, that he was lodged in a cottage in the wood below, and that every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſaid he muſt die. Emily's countenance diſcovered her emotion.</p>
                     <p>"Dear ma'amſelle." ſaid Annette, "to ſee how young ladies will diſguiſe themſelves, when they are in love! I thought you hated the Count, or I am ſure I would not have told you; and I am ſure you have cauſe enough to hate him."</p>
                     <p>"I hope I hate nobody," replied Emily, trying to ſmile; "but certainly I do not love Count Morano. I ſhould be ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to hear of any perſon dying by violent means."</p>
                     <p>"Yes, ma'amſelle, but it is his own fault."</p>
                     <p>Emily looked diſpleaſed; and Annette, miſtaking the cauſe of her diſpleaſure, immediately began to excuſe the Count, in her way. "To be ſure, it was very ungenteel behaviour," ſaid ſhe, "to break into a lady's room, and then, when he found his diſcourſing was not agreeable to her, to refuſe to go; and then, when the gentleman of the caſtle comes to deſire him to walk about his buſineſs,—to turn round, and draw his ſword, and ſwear he'll run him through the body!—To be ſure it was very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genteel behaviour, but then he was diſguiſed in love, and ſo did not know what he was about."</p>
                     <p>"Enough of this," ſaid Emily, who now ſmiled without an effort; and Annette returned to a mention of the diſagreement between Montoni and his lady. "It is nothing new," ſaid ſhe: "we ſaw and heard enough of this at Venice though I never told you of it, ma'amſelle."</p>
                     <p>"Well, Annette, it was very prudent of you not to mention it then: be as prudent now; the ſubject is an unpleaſant one."</p>
                     <p>"Ah dear, ma'amſelle!—to ſee now how conſiderate you can be about ſome folks, who care ſo little about you! I cannot bear

to ſee you ſo deceived, and I muſt tell you. But it is all for your own good, and not to ſpite my lady, though, to ſpeak truth, I have little reaſon to love her; but—"</p>
                     <p>"You are not ſpeaking thus of my aunt, I hope, Annette?" ſaid Emily, gravely.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, ma'amſelle, but I am, though; and if you knew as much as I do, you would not look ſo angry. I have often and often, heard the Signor and her talking over your marriage with the Count, and ſhe always adviſed him never to give up to your fooliſh whims, as ſhe was pleaſed to call them, but to be reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, and compel you to be obedient, whether you would or no. And I am ſure, my heart has ached a thouſand times, and I have thought, when ſhe was ſo unhappy herſelf, ſhe might have felt a little for other people, and—"</p>

                     <p>"Good God!" exclaimed Emily, bluſhing deeply, "it is ſurely impoſſible my aunt could thus have repreſented me!"</p>
                     <p>"Indeed, ma'am, I ſay nothing more than the truth, and not all of that.

                     <p>"However that may be, Annette," interrupted Emily, recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering her compoſure, "it does not become you to ſpeak of the faults of my aunt to me. I know you have meant well, but—ſay no more.—I have quite dined."</p>

"Is this, then, the reward of my ingenuouſneſs?" ſaid Emily, when ſhe was alone; "the treatment I am to receive from a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation—an aunt—who ought to have been the guardian, not the ſlanderer of my reputation,—who, as a woman, ought to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected the delicacy of female honour, and, as a relation, ſhould have protected mine! But, to utter falſehoods on ſo nice a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject—to repay the openneſs, and, I may ſay with honeſt pride, the propriety of my conduct, with ſlanders—required a depravity of heart, ſuch as I could ſcarcely have believed exiſted, ſuch as I weep to find in a relation. O! what a contraſt does her char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter preſent to that of my beloved father; while envy and low cunning form the chief traits of hers, his was diſtinguiſhed by benevolence and philoſophic wiſdom! But now, let me only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, if poſſible, that ſhe is unfortunate."</p>
                     <p>Emily threw her veil over her, and went down to walk upon the ramparts, the only walk, indeed which was open to her, though ſhe often wiſhed, that ſhe might be permitted to ramble among the woods below, and ſtill more, that ſhe might ſometimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the ſublime ſcenes of the ſurrounding country. But, as Montoni would not ſuffer her to paſs the gates of the caſtle, ſhe tried to be contented with the romantic views ſhe beheld from the walls. The peaſants, who had been employed on the fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, had left their work, and the ramparts were ſilent and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary. Their lonely appearance, together with the gloom of a lowering ſky, aſſiſted the muſings of her mind, and threw over it a kind of melancholy tranquillity, ſuch as ſhe often loved to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge. She turned to obſerve a fine effect of the ſun, as his rays, ſuddenly ſtreaming from behind a heavy cloud, lighted up the weſt towers of the caſtle, while the reſt of the edifice was in deep ſhade, except, that, through a lofty gothic arch, adjoining the tower, which led to another terrace, the beams darted in full ſplendour, and ſhewed the three ſtrangers ſhe had obſerved in the morning. Perceiving them, ſhe ſtarted, and a momentary fear came over her, as ſhe looked up the long rampart, and ſaw no other perſons. While ſhe heſitated, they approached. The gate at the end of the terrace, whither they were advancing, ſhe knew, was always locked, and ſhe could not depart by the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite extremity, without meeting them; but, before ſhe paſſed them, ſhe haſtily drew a thin veil over her face, which did, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but ill conceal her beauty. They looked earneſtly at her, and ſpoke to each other in had Italian, of which ſhe caught only a few words; but the fierceneſs of their countenances, now that ſhe was near enough to diſcriminate them, ſtruck her yet more

that the wild ſingularity of their air and dreſs had formerly none. It was the countenance and figure of him, who walked between the other two, that chiefly ſeized her attention, which expreſſed a ſullen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> thrill of horror to her heart. All this was ſo legibly written on his features, as to be ſeen by a ſingle glance, for ſhe paſſed the group ſwiftly, and her timid eyes ſcarcely reſted on them a moment. Heaving reached the terrace, ſhe ſtopped, and perceived the ſtrangers ſtanding in the ſhadow of one of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

                        </gap>, gazing after her, and ſeemingly, by their action, in earneſt converſation. She immediately left the rampart, and retired to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

He filled the goblet often, and gave a looſe to merriment and talk. The gaiety of Cavigni, on the contrary, was ſomewhat clouded by anxiety. He kept a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful eye upon Verezzi, whom, with the utmoſt-difficulty, he had hitherto reſtrained from exaſperating Montoni further againſt Morano, by a mention of his late taunting words.</p>
                     <p>One of the company exultingly recurred to the event of the preceding evening. Verezzi's eyes ſparkled. The mention of Morano led to that of Emily, of whom they were all profuſe in the praiſe, except Montoni, who ſat ſilent, and then interrupted the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>When the ſervants had withdrawn, Montoni and his friend entered into cloſe converſation, which was ſometimes checked by the iraſcible temper of Verezzi, but in which Montoni diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played his conſcious ſuperiority, by that diciſive look and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner which always accompanied the vigour of his thought, and to which moſt of his companions ſubmitted, as to a power, that they had no right to queſtion, though of each other's ſelf impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance they were jealouſly ſcrupulous. Amidſt this converſation, one of them imprudently introduced again the name of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rano; and Verezzi, now more heated by wine, diſregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the expreſſive looks of Cavigni, and gave ſome dark hints of what had paſſed on the preceding night. Theſe, however, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni did not appear to underſtand, for he continued ſilent in his chair, without diſcovering any emotion, while, the choler of Verezzi increaſing with the apparent inſenſibility of Montoni, he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

"Am I to be inſulted at my own table, and by my own friends?" ſaid Montoni, with a countenance pale in anger. "Why are the words of that madman repeated to me?" Verezzi who had expected to hear Montoni's indignation poured forth againſt Morano, and anſwered by thanks to himſelf, looked with aſtoniſhment at Cavigni, who enjoyed his confuſion. "Can you be weak enough to credit the aſſertions of a madman?" rejoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Montoni, or, what is the ſame thing, a man poſſeſſed by the ſpirit of vengeance? But he has ſucceeded too well; you believe what he ſaid."</p>
                     <p>"Signor," ſaid Verezzi, "we believe only what we know."—"How!" interrupted Montoni, ſternly: produce your proof."</p>
                     <p>"We believe only what we know," repeated Verezzi, "and we know nothing of what Morano aſſerts." Montoni ſeemed to recover himſelf. "I am haſty, my friends," ſaid he, "with reſpect to my honour; no man ſhall queſtion it with impunity, you did not mean to queſtion it. Theſe fooliſh words are not worth your remembrance, or my reſentment. Verezzi, here is to your firſt exploit."</p>
                     <p>"Succeſs to your firſt exploit," re-echoed the whole company.</p>
                     <p>"Noble Signor," replied Verezzi, glad to find he had eſcaped Montoni's reſentment, "with my good will, you ſhould build your ramparts of gold."</p>
                     <p>"Paſs the goblet," cried Montoni. "We will drink to Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora St. Aubert," ſaid Cavigni. "By your leave, we will firſt drink to the lady of the caſtle," ſaid Bertolini—Montoni was ſilent. "To the lady of the caſtle," ſaid his gueſts. He bowed his head.</p>
                     <p>"It much ſurpriſes me, Signor," ſaid Bertolini, "that you have ſo long neglected this caſtle; it is a noble edifice."</p>
                     <p>"It ſuits our purpoſe," replied Montoni, "and <hi>is</hi> a noble edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. You know not, it ſeems, by what miſchance it came to me."</p>
                     <p>"It was a lucky miſchance, be it what it may, Signor," replied Bertolini, ſmiling. "I would, that one ſo lucky had befallen me."</p>
                     <p>Montoni looked gravely at him. "If you will attend to what I ſay," he reſumed, "you ſhall hear the ſtory."</p>
                     <p>The countenances of Bertolini and Verezzi expreſſed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than curioſity; Cavigni, who ſeemed to feel none, had probably heard the relation before.</p>
                     <p>"It is now near twenty years," ſaid Montoni, "ſince this caſtle came into my poſſeſſion. I inherit it by the female line. The lady, my predeceſſor, was only diſtantly related to me; I am the laſt of her family. She was beautiful and rich; I wooed her;
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:029378_0150_0FE08234F76DC9F0"/>
but her heart was fixed upon another, and ſhe rejected me. It is probable, however, that ſhe was herſelf rejected of the perſon, whoever he might be, on whom ſhe beſtowed her favour, for a deep and ſettled melancholy took poſſeſſion of her; and I have reaſon to believe ſhe put a period to her own life. I was not at the caſtle at the time; but, as there are ſome ſingular and myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious circumſtances attending that event. I ſhall repeat them."</p>
                     <p>"Repeat them!" ſaid a voice.</p>
                     <p>Montoni was ſilent; the gueſts looked at each other, to know who ſpoke; but they perceived, that each was making the ſame inquiry. Montoni, at length, recovering himſelf, "We are overheard," ſaid he: "we will finiſh this ſubject another time. Paſs the goblet."</p>
                     <p>The cavaliers looked round the wide chamber.</p>
                     <p>"Here is no perſon, but ourſelves," ſaid Verezzi: "pray, Signor, proceed."</p>
                     <p>"Did you hear any thing?" ſaid Montoni.</p>
                     <p>"We did," ſaid Bertolini.</p>
                     <p>"It could be only fancy," ſaid Verezzi, looking round again. "We ſee no perſon beſides ourſelves; and the ſound I thought I heard ſeemed within the room. Pray, Signor, go on."</p>
                     <p>Montoni pauſed a moment, and then proceeded in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"Ye are to know, Signors, that the Lady Laurentini had for ſome months ſhewn ſymptoms of a dejected mind, nay, of a diſturbed imagination. Her mood was very unequal; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhe was ſunk in calm melancholy, and, at others, as I have been told, ſhe betrayed all the ſymptoms of frantic mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It was one night in the month of October, after ſhe had recovered from one of thoſe ſits of exceſs, and had ſunk again into her uſual melancholy, that ſhe retired alone to her chamber, and forbade all interruption. It was the chamber at the end of the corridor, Signors, where we had the affray, laſt night. From that hour, ſhe was ſeen no more."</p>
                     <p>"How! ſeen no more!" ſaid Bertolini, "was not her body ſound in the chamber?"</p>
                     <p>"Were her remains never found?" cried the reſt of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany altogether.</p>
                     <p>"Never!" replied Montoni.</p>
                     <p>"What reaſons were there to ſuppoſe ſhe deſtroyed herſelf, then?" ſaid Bertolini.—"Aye, what reaſons?" ſaid Verezzi.—"How happened it, that her remains were never found? Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſhe killed herſelf, ſhe could not bury herſelf," Montoni
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:029378_0150_0FE08234F76DC9F0"/>
looked indignantly at Verezzi, who began to apologize. "Your pardon, Signor," ſaid he: "I did not conſider, that the lady was your relative, when I ſpoke of her ſo lightly."</p>
                     <p>Montoni accepted the apology.</p>
                     <p>"But the Signor will oblige us with the reaſons, which urged him to believe, that the lady committed ſuicide."</p>
                     <p>"Thoſe I will explain hereafter," ſaid Montoni: "at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent let me relate a moſt extraordinary circumſtance. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation goes no further, Signors. Liſten, then, to what I am going to ſay."</p>
                     <p>"Liſten!" ſaid a voice.</p>
                     <p>They were all again ſilent, and the countenance of Montoni changed. "This is no illuſion of the fancy," ſaid Cavigni, at length breaking the profound ſilence.—"No," ſaid Bertolini; "I heard it myſelf, now. Yet here is no perſon in the room but ourſelves!"</p>
                     <p>"This is very extraordinary," ſaid Montoni, ſuddenly riſing. "This is not to be borne; here is ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

His gueſts were equally ready to quit the apartment but the ſubject had rouſed their curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and they entreated Montoni to withdraw to another cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and finiſh it; no entreaties could, however, prevail with him.

                     <p>WE now return to Valancourt, who, it may be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, remained at Tholouſe, ſometime after the departure of Emily, reſtleſs and miſerable. Each morrow, that approached he deſigned ſhould carry him from thence; yet to-morrow and to-morrow came, and ſtill ſaw him lingering in the ſcene of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

He could not immediately tear himſelf from the ſpot, where he had been accuſtomed to converſe with Emily, or from the objects they had viewed together, which appeared to him memorials of her affection, as well as a kind of ſurety for its faithfulneſs; and, next to the pain of bidding her adieu, was that of leaving the ſcenes, which ſo powerfully awakened her image. Sometimes he had bribed a ſervant, who had been left in the care of Madame Montoni's chateau, to permit him to viſit the gardens, and there he would wander, for hours togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, wrapt in a melancholy, not unpleaſing. The terrace and the pavilion at the end of it, where he had taken leave of Emily, on the eve of her departure from Tholouſe, were his moſt favourite haunts. There, as he walked, or leaned from the window of the building, he would endeavour to recollect all ſhe had ſaid, on that night; to catch the tones of her voice, as they faintly vibrated on his memory, and to remember the exact expreſſion of her countenance, which ſometimes came ſuddenly to his fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, like a viſion; that beautiful countenance, which awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as by inſtantaneous magic, all the tenderneſs of his heart and ſeemed to tell with irreſiſtible eloquence—that he had lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> her for ever! At theſe moments, his hurried ſteps would have diſcovered to a ſpectator the deſpair of his heart. The char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter of Montoni, ſuch as he had received from hints, and ſuch as his fears repreſented it, would riſe to his view, together with all the dangers it ſeemed to threaten to Emily and to his love. He blamed himſelf, that he had not urged theſe more forcibly to her, while it might have been in his power to detain her, and that he had ſuffered an abſurd and criminal delicacy, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> he termed it, to conquer ſo ſoon the reaſonable arguments he had oppoſed to this journey. Any evil that might have attended their marriage, ſeemed ſo inferior to thoſe, which now threatened, their love, or even to the ſufferings, that abſence occaſioned,
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:029378_0151_0FE08242C4929FB0"/>
that he wondered how he could have ceaſed to urge his ſuit, till he had convinced her of its propriety and he would certainly now have followed her to Italy, if he could have been ſpared from his regiment for ſo long a journey. His regiment, indeed, ſoon reminded him, that he had other duties to attend, than thoſe of love.</p>
                     <p>A ſhort time after his arrival at his brother's houſe, he was ſummoned to join his brother officers, and he accompanied a battalion to Paris; where a ſcene of novelty and gaiety opened upon him, ſuch as, till then, he had only a faint idea of. But gaiety diſguſted, and company fatigued, his ſick mind; and he became an object of unceaſing raillery to his companions, from whom, whenever he could ſteal an opportunity, he eſcaped, to think of Emily. The ſcenes around him, however, and the company with whom he was obliged to mingle, engaged his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, though they failed to amuſe his fancy, and thus gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally weakened the habit of yielding to lamentation, till it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared leſs a duty to his love to indulge it. Among his brother officers were many, who added to the ordinary character of a French ſoldier's gaiety ſome of thoſe faſcinating qualities, which too frequently throw a veil over folly, and ſometimes even ſoften the features of vice into ſmiles. To theſe men the reſerved and thoughtful manners of Valancourt were a kind of tacit cenſure on their own, for which they rallied him when preſent, and plotted againſt him when abſent; they gloried in the thought of redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing him to their own level, and, conſidering it to be a ſpirited frolic, determined to accompliſh it.</p>
                     <p>Valancourt was a ſtranger to the gradual progreſs of ſcheme and intrigue, againſt which he could not be on his guard. He had not been accuſtomed to receive ridicule, and he could ill endure its ſting; he reſented it, and this only drew upon him a louder laugh. To eſcape from ſuch ſcenes, he fled into ſolitude, and there the image of Emily met him, and revived the pangs of love and deſpair. He then ſought to renew thoſe taſteful ſtudies, which had been the delight of his early years; but his mind had loſt the tranquillity, which is neceſſary for their enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. To forget himſelf and the grief and anxiety, which the idea of her recalled, he would quit his ſolitude, and again min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Thus paſſed weeks after weeks, time gradually ſoftening his ſorrow, and habit ſtrengthening his deſire of amuſement, till the ſcenes around him ſeemed to awaken into a new character, and Valancourt, to have fallen among them from the clouds.</p>

His figure and addreſs made him a welcome viſitor, wherever he had been introduced, and he ſoon frequented the moſt gay and faſhionable circles of Paris. Among theſe, was the aſſembly of the Counteſs Lacleur, a woman of eminent beauty and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivating manners. She had paſſed the ſpring of youth, but her wit prolonged the triumph of its reign, and they mutually aſſiſted the fame of each other; for thoſe, who were charmed by her lovelineſs, ſpoke with enthuſiaſm of her talents; and others, who admired her playful imagination, declared, that her perſonal gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were unrivalled. But her imagination was merely playful, and her wit, if ſuch it could be called, was brilliant, rather than juſt; it dazzled, and its fallacy eſcaped the detection of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for the accents, in which ſhe pronounced it, and the ſmile that accompanied them, were, a ſpell upon the judgment of the auditors. Her <hi>petits ſoupers</hi> were the moſt taſteful of any in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, and were frequented by many of the ſecond claſs of literati. She was fond of muſic, was herſelf a ſcientific performer, and had frequently concerts at her houſe. Valancourt, who paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately loved muſic, and who ſometimes aſſiſted at theſe concerts, admired her execution, but remembered with a ſigh the eloquent ſimplicity of Emily's ſongs and the natural expreſſion of her man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which waited not to be approved by the judgment, but found their way at once to the heart.</p>
                     <p>Madame <hi>La Comteſſe</hi> had often deep play at her houſe, which ſhe affected to reſtrain, but ſecretly encouraged; and it was well known among her friends, that the ſplendour of her eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was chiefly ſupplied from the profits of her tables. But her <hi>petits ſoupers</hi> were the moſt charming imaginable! Here were all the delicacies of the four quarters of the world, all the wit and the lighter efforts of genius, all the graces of converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—the ſmiles of beauty, and the charms of muſic; and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt paſſed his pleaſanteſt, as well as moſt dangerous hours in theſe parties.</p>
                     <p>His brother, who remained with his family in Gaſcony, had contented himſelf with giving him letters of introduction to ſuch of his relations, reſiding at Paris, as the latter was not already known to. All theſe were perſons of ſome diſtinction; and, as neither the perſon, mind, or manners of Valancourt the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger threatened to diſgrace their alliance, they received him with as much kindneſs as their nature, hardened by uninterrupted proſperity, would admit of; but their attentions did not extend to acts of real friendſhip; for they were too much occupied by their own purſuits, to feel any intereſt in his; and thus he was
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:029378_0152_0FE08248A937AE78"/>
ſet down in the midſt of Paris, in the pride of youth, with an open, unſuſpicious temper and ardent affections, without one friend to warn him of the dangers, to which he was expoſed. Emily, who, had ſhe been preſent, would have ſaved him from theſe evils by awakening his heart, and engageing him in worthy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, now only increaſed his danger;—it was to loſe the grief, which the remembrance of her occaſioned, that he firſt ſought amuſement; and for this end he purſued it, till habit made it an object of abſtract intereſt.</p>
                     <p>There was alſo a Marchioneſs Champfort, a young widow, at whoſe aſſemblies he paſſed much of his time. She was hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, ſtill more artful, gay and fond of intrigue. The ſociety, which ſhe drew round her, was leſs elegant and more vicious, than that of the Counteſs Lacleur: but, as ſhe had addreſs enough to throw a veil, though but a ſlight one, over the worſt parts of her character, ſhe was ſtill viſited by many perſons of what is called diſtinction. Valancourt was introduced to her parties by two of his brother officers, whoſe late ridicule he had now forgiven ſo far, that he could ſometimes join in the laugh, which a mention his former manners would renew.</p>
                     <p>The gaiety of the moſt ſplendid court in Europe, the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence of the palaces, entertainments, and equipages, that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded him—all conſpired to dazzle his imagination, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate his ſpirits, and the example and maxims of his military aſſociates to delude his mind. Emily's image, indeed, ſtill lived there; but it was no longer the friend, the monitor, that ſaved him from himſelf, and, to which he retired to weep the ſweet, yet melancholy tears of tenderneſs. When he had recourſe to it, it aſſumed a countenance of mild reproach, that wrung his ſoul and called forth tears of unmixed miſery; his only eſcape from which was to forget the object of it, and he endeavoured, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to think of Emily as ſeldom as he could.</p>
                     <p>Thus dangerouſly circumſtanced was Valancourt, at the time, when Emily was ſuffering at Venice, from the perſecuting ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes of Count Morano, and the unjuſt authority of Montoni; at which period we leave him.</p>

                     <p>LEAVING the gay ſcenes of Paris, we return to thoſe of the gloomy Apennine, where Emily's thoughts were ſtill faithful to Valancourt. Looking to him as to her only hope, ſhe recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with jealous exactneſs, every aſſurance and every proof ſhe had witneſſed of his affection; read again and again the letters ſhe had received from him; weighed, with intenſe anxiety, the force of every word, that ſpoke of his attachment; and dried her tears, as ſhe truſted in his truth.</p>
                     <p>Montoni, meanwhile, had made ſtrict inquiry, concerning the ſtrange circumſtance of his alarm, without obtaining information; and was, at length, obliged to account for it by the reaſonable ſuppoſition, that it was a miſchievous trick played off by one of his domeſtics. His diſagreements with Madame Montoni, on the ſubject of her ſettlements, were now more frequent than ever; he even confined her entirely to her own apartment, and did not ſcruple to threaten her with much greater ſeverity, ſhould ſhe perſevere in a refuſal.</p>
                     <p>Reaſon, had ſhe conſulted it, would now have perplexed her in the choice of a conduct to be adopted. It would have point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out the danger of irritating by further oppoſition a man, ſuch as Montoni had proved himſelf to be, and to whoſe power ſhe had ſo entirely committed herſelf; and it would alſo have told her, of what extreme importance to her future comfort it was, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve for herſelf thoſe poſſeſſions, which would enable her to live independently of Montoni ſhould ſhe ever eſcape from his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate control. But ſhe was directed by a more deciſive guide than reaſon—the ſpirit of revenge, which urged her to oppoſe violence to violence, and obſtinacy to obſtinacy.</p>
                     <p>Wholly confined to the ſolitude of her apartment, ſhe was now reduced to ſolicit the ſociety ſhe ſo lately rejected; for Emily was the only perſon except Annette, with whom ſhe was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to converſe.</p>
                     <p>Generouſly anxious for her peace, Emily, therefore tried to perſuade, when ſhe could not convince, and ſought by every gentle means to induce her to forbear that aſperity of reply, which ſo greatly irritated Montoni. The pride of her aunt
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:029378_0153_0FE082579884A450"/>
did ſometimes ſoften to the ſoothing voice of Emily, and there even were moments when ſhe regarded her affectionate atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with good will.</p>
                     <p>The ſcenes of terrible contention, to which Emily was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently compelled to be witneſs, exhauſted her ſpirits more than any circumſtances, that had occurred ſince her departure from Tholouſe. The gentleneſs and goodneſs of her parents, together with the ſcenes of her early happineſs, often ſtole on her mind, like the viſions of a higher world; while the characters and circumſtances, now paſſing beneath her eye, excited both ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and ſurpriſe. She could ſcarcely have imagined, that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſo fierce and ſo various, as thoſe which Montoni exhibited, could have been concentrated in one individual; yet what more ſurpriſed her, was, that on great occaſions, he could bend theſe paſſions, wild <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Her preſent life appeared like the dream of a diſtempered imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ination, or like one of thoſe frightful fictions, in which the wild genius of the poets ſometimes delighted. Reflection brought only regret, and anticipation terror. How often did ſhe wiſh to "ſteal the lark's wing, and mount the ſwifteſt gale," that Languedoc and repoſe might once more be hers!</p>
                     <p>Of Count Morano's health ſhe made frequent inquiry; but Annette heard only vague reports of his danger, and that his ſurgeon had ſaid he would never leave the cottage alive; while Emily could not but be ſhocked to think, that ſhe, however in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently, might be the means of his death: and Annette who did not fail to obſerve her emotion, interpreted it in her own way. But a circumſtance ſoon occurred, whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> entirely withdrew An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette's attention from this ſubject, and awakened the ſurpriſe and curioſity ſo natural to her. Coming one day to Emily's apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with a countenance full of importance, "What can all this mean, ma'amſelle?" ſaid ſhe. "Would I was once ſafe in Languedoc again, they ſhould never catch me going on my travels any more! I muſt think it a fine thing, truely, to come abroad, and ſee foreign parts! I little thought I was coming to be catched up in an old caſtle, among ſuch dreary mountains, with the chance of being murdered, or what is as good, having my throat cut!"</p>
                     <p>"What can all this mean, indeed, Annette?" ſaid Emily, in aſtoniſhment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="80" facs="unknown:029378_0154_0FE0825C496F0A00"/>
"Aye, ma'amſelle, you may look ſurpriſed; but you won't believe it, perhaps, till they have murdered you, too. You would not believe about the ghoſt I told you of, though I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you the very place, where it uſed to appear!—You will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve nothing, ma'amſelle."</p>
                     <p>"Not till you ſpeak more reaſonably, Annette; for Heaven's ſake explain your meaning. You ſpoke of murder!"</p>
                     <p>"Aye, ma'amſelle, they are coming to murder us all, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps; but what ſignifies explaining?—you will not believe."</p>
                     <p>Emily again deſired her to relate what ſhe had ſeen or heard.</p>
                     <p>"O, I have ſeen enough, ma'am, and heard too much, as Ludovico can prove. Poor ſoul! they will murder him, too! I little thought, when he ſung thoſe ſweet verſes under my lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, at Venice!"—Emily looked impatient and diſpleaſed.—"Well, ma'amſelle, as I was ſaying, theſe preparations about the caſtle, and theſe ſtrange looking people, that are calling here every day, and the Signor's cruel uſage of my lady, and his odd goings on—all theſe, as I told Ludovico, can bode no good.—And he bid me hold my tongue. So, ſays I, the Signor's ſtrangely altered, Ludovico, in this gloomy caſtle, to what he was in France; there all ſo gay! Nobody ſo gallant to my lady, then; and he could ſmile, too, upon a poor ſervant, ſometimes, and jeer her, too, good-naturedly enough. I remember once, when he ſaid to me, as I was going out of my lady's dreſſing room—Annette, ſays he—"</p>
                     <p>"Never mind what the Signor ſaid," interrupted Emily; "but tell me, at once, the circumſtance, which has thus alarmed you."</p>
                     <p>"Aye, ma'amſelle," rejoined Annette, "that is juſt what Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovico ſaid: ſays he, Never mind what the Signor ſays to you. So I told him what I thought about the Signor. He is ſo ſtrangely altered, ſaid I: for now he is ſo haughty, and ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, and ſo ſharp with my lady; and, if he meets one, he'll ſcarcely look at one, unleſs it be to frown. So much the better, ſays Ludovico, ſo much the better. And to tell you the truth, ma'amſelle, I thought this was a very ill-natured ſpeech of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovico: but I went on. And then, ſays I, he is always knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his brows; and if one ſpeaks to him, he does not hear; and then he ſits up counſelling ſo, of a night, with the other Signors—there they are, till long paſt midnight diſcourſing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether! Aye, but ſays Ludovico, you don't know what they are counſelling about. No, ſaid I, but I can gueſs—it is about my young lady. Upon that, Ludovico burſt out a laughing, quite
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:029378_0154_0FE0825C496F0A00"/>
loud; ſo he put me in a huff, for I did not like that either I, or you ma'amſelle, ſhould be laughed at; and I turned away quick, but he ſtopped me. 'Don't be affronted. Annette.' ſaid he, 'but I cannot help laughing;' and with that he laughed again. 'What!' ſays he, do you think the Signors ſit up, night after night, only to counſel about thy young lady! No, no, there is ſomething more in the wind than that. And theſe repairs about the caſtle, and theſe preparations about the ramparts—they are not making about young ladies.' Why ſurely, ſaid I, the Signor, my maſter, is not going to make war? 'Make war!' ſaid Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovico, 'what, upon the mountains and the woods? for here is no living ſoul to make war upon, that I ſee.'</p>
                     <p>"What are theſe preparations for, then? ſaid I; why ſurely nobody is coming to take away my maſter's caſtle! 'Then there are ſo many ill looking fellows coming to the caſtle every day.' ſays Ludovico, without anſwering my queſtion, 'and the Signor ſees them all, and talks with them all, and they all ſtay in the neighbourhood! By holy St. Marco! ſome of them are the moſt cut-throat-looking dogs I ever ſet my eyes upon.'</p>
                     <p>"I aſked Ludovico again, if he thought they were coming to take away my maſter's caſtle; and he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

                        </gap>, he did not think they were, but he did not know for certain. 'Then, yeſterday,' ſaid he, but you muſt not tell this, ma'amſelle, 'yeſterday, a party of theſe men came, and left all their horſes in the caſtle ſtables, where, it ſeems, they are to ſtay, for the Signor ordered them all to be entertained with the beſt provender in the manger; but the men are, moſt of them; in the neighbouring cottages.'</p>
                     <p>"So, ma'amſelle, I came to tell you all this, for I never heard any thing ſo ſtrange in my life. But what can theſe ill-looking men be come about, if it is not to murder us? And the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor knows this, or why ſhould he be ſo civil to them? And why ſhould he fortify the caſtle, and counſel ſo much with the other Signors, and be ſo thoughtful?"</p>
                     <p>"Is this all you have to tell, Annette?" ſaid Emily. "Have you heard nothing elſe that alarms you?"</p>
                     <p>"Nothing elſe, ma'amſelle!" ſaid Annette; "why, is not this enough?" "Quite enough for my patience. Annette, but not quite enough to convince me we are all to be murdered, though I acknowledge here is ſufficient food for curioſity." She forbore to ſpeak her apprehenſions, becauſe ſhe would not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Annette's wild terrors; but the preſent circumſtances of the caſtle both ſurpriſed, and alarmed her. Annette, having told her tale, left the chamber, on the wing for new wonders.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="82" facs="unknown:029378_0155_0FE0826A78968AB0"/>
In the evening, Emily had paſſed ſome melancholy hours with Madame Montoni, and was retiring to reſt, when ſhe was alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a ſtrange and loud knocking at her chamber door, and then a heavy weight fell againſt it, that almoſt burſt it open. She called to know who was there, and receiving no anſwer, repeated the call; but a chilling ſilence followed. It occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to her—for, at this moment, ſhe could not reaſon on the probability of circumſtances—that ſome one of the ſtrangers, lately arrived at the caſtle, had diſcovered her apartment, and was come with ſuch intent, as their looks rendered too poſſible—to rob, perhaps to murder, her. The moment ſhe admitted this poſſibility, terror ſupplied the place of conviction, and a kind of inſtinctive remembrance of her remote ſituation from the family heightened it to a degree, that almoſt overcame her ſenſes.—She looked at the door, which led to the ſtaircaſe, expecting to ſee it open, and liſtening, in fearful ſilence, for a return of the noiſe, till ſhe began to think it had proceeded from this door, and a wiſh of eſcaping through the oppoſite one ruſhed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her mind. She went to the gallery door, and then, fearing to open it, leſt ſome perſon might be ſilently lurking for her without, ſhe ſtopped, but with her eyes fixed in expectation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the oppoſite door of the ſtaircaſe. As thus ſhe ſtood, ſhe heard a faint breathing near her, and became convinced, that ſome perſon was on the other ſide of the door, which was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ked. She ſought for other faſtening, but there was none.</p>
                     <p>While ſhe yet liſtened, the breathing was diſtinctly heard, and her terror was not ſoothed, when, looking round her wide and lonely chamber, ſhe again conſidered her remote ſituation. As ſhe ſtood heſitating whether to call for aſſiſtance, the continuance of the ſtillneſs ſurpriſed her; and her ſpirits would have revived, had ſhe not continued to hear the faint breathing, that convinced her; the perſon, whoever it was, had not quitted the door.</p>
                     <p>At length, worn out with anxiety, ſhe determined to call loudly for aſſiſtance from her caſement, and was advancing to it, when, whether the terror of her mind gave her ideal ſounds, or that real ones did come, ſhe thought footſteps were aſcending the private ſtaircaſe; and, expecting to ſee its door uncloſe, ſhe forgot all other cauſe of alarm, and retreated towards the corridor. Here ſhe endeavoured to make her eſcape, but, on opening the door, was very near falling over a perſon, who lay on the floor without. She ſcreamed, and would have paſſed, but her trembling frame refuſed to ſupport her; and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in which ſhe leaned againſt the wall of the gallery, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:029378_0155_0FE0826A78968AB0"/>
her leiſure to obſerve the figure before her, and to recognize the features of Annette. Fear inſtantly yielded to ſurpriſe. She ſpoke in vain to the poor girl, who remained ſenſeleſs on the floor, and then, loſing all conſciouſneſs of her own weakneſs, hurried to her aſſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>When Annette recovered, ſhe was helped by Emily into the chamber, but was ſtill unable to ſpeak, and looked round her, as if her eyes followed ſome perſon in the room. Emily tried to ſooth her diſturbed ſpirits, and forbore at preſent, to aſk her any queſtions; but the faculty of ſpeech was never long withheld from Annette, and ſhe explained, in broken ſentences, and in her tedious way, the occaſion of her diſorder. She affirmed, and with a ſolemnity of conviction, that almoſt ſtaggered the incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity of Emily, that ſhe had ſeen an apparition, as ſhe was paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her bedroom, through the corridor.</p>
                     <p>"I had heard ſtrange ſtories of that chamber before," ſaid Annette: "but as it was ſo near yours, ma'amſelle, I would not tell them to you, becauſe they would frighten you. The ſervants had told me, often and often, that it was haunted, and, that was the reaſon why it was ſhut up: nay, for that matter, why the whole ſtring of theſe rooms, here, are ſhut up. I quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whenever I went by, and I muſt ſay, I did ſometimes think I heard odd noiſes within it. But, as I ſaid, as I was paſſing along the corridor, and not thinking a word about the matter, or even of the ſtrange voice that the Signors heard the other night, all of a ſudden comes a great light, and, looking behind me, there was a tall figure, (I ſaw it as plainly ma'amſelle, as I ſee you at this moment) a tall figure gliding along (Oh! I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deſcribe how!) into the room that is always ſhut up, and nobody has the key of it but the Signor, and the door ſhut directly.</p>
                     <p>"Then it doubtleſs was the Signor," ſaid Emily.</p>
                     <p>"O no, ma'amſelle, it could not be him, for I left him buſy a quarrelling in my lady's dreſſing room!"</p>
                     <p>"You bring me ſtrange tales, Annette," ſaid Emily: "it was but this morning, that you would have terrified me with the apprehenſion of murder; and now you would perſuade me, you have ſeen a ghoſt! Theſe wonderful ſtories come too quickly."</p>
                     <p>"Nay, ma'amſelle, I will ſay no more, only, if I had not been frightened, I ſhould not have fainted dead away, ſo. I ran as faſt as I could, to get to your door; but what was worſt of all, I could not call out; then I thought ſomething muſt be ſtrangely the matter with me, and directly I dropt down."</p>

"Was it the chamber where the black veil hangs?" ſaid Emily. "O! no, ma'amſelle, it was one nearer to this. What ſhall I do, to get to my room? I would not go out into the corridor again, for the whole world!" Emily, whoſe ſpirits had been ſeverely ſhocked, and who, therefore, did not like the thought of paſſing the night alone, told her ſhe might ſleep where ſhe was. "O, no, ma'amſelle," replied Annette, "I would not ſleep in the room now, for a thouſand ſequins!"</p>
                     <p>Wearied and diſappointed, Emily firſt ridiculed, though ſhe ſhared, her fears, and then tried to ſooth them; but neither at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ſucceeded, and the girl perſiſted in believing and affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that what ſhe had ſeen was nothing human. It was not till ſometime after Emily had recovered her compoſure, that ſhe recollected the ſteps ſhe had heard on the ſtaircaſe—a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, however, which made her inſiſt that Annette ſhould paſs the night with her, and, with much difficulty, ſhe, at length, prevailed, aſſiſted by that part of the girl's fear, which concerned the corridor.</p>
                     <p>Early on the following morning, as Emily croſſed the hall to the ramparts, ſhe heard a noiſy buſtle in the court yard, and the clatter of horſes' hoofs. Such unuſual ſounds excited her curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity; and, inſtead of going to the ramparts, ſhe went to an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per caſement, from whence ſhe ſaw, in the court below, a large party of horſemen, dreſſed in a ſingular, but uniform, habit, and completely, though variouſly armed. They wore a kind of ſhort jacket, compoſed of black and ſcarlet, and ſeveral of them had a cloak, of plain black, which, covering the perſon entirely, hung down to the ſtirrups. As one of theſe cloaks glanced aſide, ſhe ſaw, beneath, daggers, apparently of different ſizes, tucked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the horſeman's belt. She further obſerved, that theſe were carried, in the ſame manner, by many of the horſemen without cloaks, moſt of whom bore alſo pikes, or javelins. On their heads, were the ſmall Italian caps, ſome of which were diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by black feathers. Whether theſe caps gave a fierce air to the countenance, or that the countenances they ſurmounted had naturally ſuch an appearance, Emily thought ſhe had never, till then, ſeen an aſſemblage of faces ſo ſavage and terrific.—While ſhe gazed, ſhe almoſt fancied herſelf ſurrounded by ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditti; and a vague thought glanced athwart her fancy—that Montoni was the captain of the group before her, and that this caſtle was to be the place of rendezvous. The ſtrange and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ſuppoſition was but momentary, though her reaſon could ſupply none more probable, and though ſhe diſcovered, among
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:029378_0156_0FE0826F245358D0"/>
the band, the ſtrangers ſhe had formerly noticed with ſo much alarm, who were now diſtinguiſhed by the black plume.</p>
                     <p>While ſhe continued gazing, Cavigni, Verezzi, and Bertolini came forth from the hall, habited like the reſt, except that they wore hats, with a mixed plume of black and ſcarlet, and that their arms differed from thoſe of the reſt of the party. As they mounted their horſes, Emily was ſtruck with the exulting joy, expreſſed on the viſage of Verezzi, while Cavigni was gay, yet with a ſhade of thought on his countenance; and, as he manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his horſe with dexterity, his graceful and commanding figure, which exhibited the majeſty of a hero, had never appeared to more advantage. Emily, as ſhe obſerved him, thought he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what reſembled Valancourt, in the ſpirit and dignity of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but ſhe looked in vain for the noble, benevolent counten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance—the ſoul's intelligence, which overſpread the features of the latter.</p>
                     <p>As ſhe was hoping, ſhe ſcarcely knew why, that Montoni would accompany the party, he appeared at the hall door, but unaccoutred. Having carefully obſerved the horſemen, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed awhile with the cavaliers, and bidden them farewel, the band wheeled round the court, and, led by Verezzi, iſſued forth under the portcullis; Montoni following to the portal, and gaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after them for ſometime. Emily then retired from the caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and, now certain of being unmoleſted, went to walk on the ramparts, from whence ſhe ſoon after ſaw the party winding among the mountains to the weſt, appearing and diſappearing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the woods, till diſtance confuſed their figures, conſolidated their numbers, and only a dingy maſs appeared moving along the heights.</p>
                     <p>Emily obſerved, that no workmen were on the ramparts, and that the repairs of the fortifications ſeemed to be completed. While ſhe ſauntered thoughtfully on, ſhe heard diſtant footſteps, and, raiſing her eyes, ſaw ſeveral men lurking under the caſtle walls, who were evidently not workmen, but looked, as if they would have accorded well with the party, which was gone. Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering where Annette had hid herſelf ſo long, who might have explained ſome of the late circumſtances, and then conſidering that Madame Montoni was probably riſen, ſhe went to her dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing room, where ſhe mentioned what had occurred; but Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame Montoni either would not, or could not, give any expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the event. The Signor's reſerve to his wife, on this ſubject, was probably nothing more than uſual; yet, to Emily, it gave an air of myſtery to the whole affair, that ſeemed to hint, there was danger, if not villainy, in his ſchemes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="86" facs="unknown:029378_0157_0FE0697B8CA1C3C0"/>
Annette preſently came, and, as uſual, was full of alarm; to her lady's eager inquiries of what ſhe had heard among the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, ſhe replied:</p>
                     <p>"Ah, Madam! nobody knows what it is all about, but old Carlo; he knows well enough, I dare ſay, but he is as cloſe as his maſter. Some ſay the Signor is going out to frighten the enemy, as they call it: but where is the enemy? Then others ſay, he is going to take away ſome body's caſtle: but I am ſure he has room enough in his own, without taking other people's; and I am ſure I ſhould like it a great deal better, if there were more people to fill it."</p>
                     <p>"Ah! you will ſoon have your wiſh, I fear," replied Madame Montoni.</p>
                     <p>"No, madam, but ſuch ill looking fellows are not worth hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I mean ſuch gallant, ſmart, merry fellows as Ludovico, who is always telling droll ſtories, to make one laugh. It was but yeſterday he told me ſuch a <hi>humourſome</hi> tale! I can't help laughing at it now.—Says he—"</p>
                     <p>"Well, we can diſpenſe with the ſtory," ſaid her lady. "Ah!" continued Annette, "he ſees a great way, a great way further than other people! Now he ſees into all the Signor's meaning, without knowing a word about the matter!"</p>
                     <p>"How is that?" ſaid Madame Montoni.</p>
                     <p>"Why he ſays—but he made me promiſe not to tell, and I would not diſoblige him for the world."</p>
                     <p>"What is it he made you promiſe not to tell? ſaid her lady, ſternly. "I inſiſt upon knowing immediately—what is it he made you promiſe?"</p>
                     <p>"O Madam," cried Annette, "I would not tell for the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe!" "I inſiſt upon your telling this inſtant," ſaid Madame Montoni. "O dear madam! I would not tell for an hundred ſequins! You would not have me forſwear myſelf, madam!" ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Annette.</p>
                     <p>"I will not wait another moment," ſaid Madam Montoni Annette was ſilent.</p>
                     <p>"The Signor ſhall be informed of this directly," rejoined her miſtreſs: "he will make you diſcover all."</p>
                     <p>"It is Ludovico, who has diſcovered," ſaid Annette: "but for mercy's ſake, madam, don't tell the Signor, and you ſhall know all directly." Madam Montoni ſaid, that ſhe would not.</p>
                     <p>"Well then, madam, Ludovico ſays, that the Signor, my maſter, is—is—that is, he only thinks ſo, and any body, you know, madam, is free to think—that the Signor, my maſter, is—is—"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="87" facs="unknown:029378_0157_0FE0697B8CA1C3C0"/>
"Is what?" ſaid her lady impatiently.</p>
                     <p>"That the Signor, my maſter, is going to be—a great rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber—that is—he is going to rob on his own account;—to be, (but I am ſure I don't underſtand what he means) to be a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of—robbers."</p>
                     <p>"Art thou in thy ſenſes, Annette?" ſaid Madame Montoni; or is this a trick to deceive me? Tell me, this inſtant, what Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovico <hi>did</hi> ſay to thee;—no equivocation;—this inſtant."</p>
                     <p>"Nay, madam," cried Annette, "if this is all I am to get for having told the ſecret"—Her miſtreſs thus continued to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, and Annette to proteſt, till Montoni, himſelf, appeared, who bade the latter leave the room, and ſhe withdrew, trembling for the fate of her ſtory. Emily alſo was retiring, but her aunt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired ſhe would ſtay; and Montoni had ſo often made her a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their contention, that he no longer had ſcruples on that account.</p>
                     <p>"I inſiſt upon knowing this inſtant, Signor, what all this means:" ſaid his wife—"what are all theſe armed men, whom they tell me of, gone out about?" Montoni anſwered her only with a look of ſcorn; and Emily wiſpered ſomething to her. "It does not ſignify," ſaid her aunt: "I will know; and I will know, too, what the caſtle has been fortified for."</p>
                     <p>"Come, come," ſaid Montoni, "other buſineſs brought me here. I muſt be trifled with no longer. I have immediate oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for what I demand—thoſe eſtates muſt be given up, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further contention: or I may find a way—"</p>
                     <p>"They never ſhall be given up," interrupted Madame Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni: "they never ſhall enable you to carry on your wild ſchemes;—but what are theſe? I will know. Do you expect the caſtle to be attacked? Do you expect enemies? Am I to be ſhut up here, to be killed in a ſiege?"</p>
                     <p>"Sign the writings," ſaid Montoni, "and you ſhall know more."</p>
                     <p>"What enemy can be coming?" continued his wife. "Have you entered into the ſervice of the ſtate? Am I to be blocked up here to die?"</p>
                     <p>"That may poſſibly happen," ſaid Montoni, "unleſs you yield to my demand: for, come what may, you ſhall not quit the caſtle till then." Madame Montoni burſt into loud la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, which ſhe as ſuddenly checked, conſidering that her huſband's aſſertions might be only artifices, employed to extort her conſent. She hinted this ſuſpicion, and, in the next moment told him alſo, that his deſigns were not ſo honourable as to ſerve
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:029378_0158_0FE082816FC42A28"/>
the ſtate, and that ſhe believed he had only commenced a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of banditti, to join the enemies of Venice, in plundering and laying waſte the ſurrounding country.</p>
                     <p>Montoni looked at her for a moment with a ſteady and ſtern countenance; while Emily trembled, and his wife, for once, thought ſhe had ſaid too much. "You ſhall be removed, this night," ſaid he, "to the eaſt turret: there, perhaps, you may underſtand the danger of offending a man, who has an unlimited power over you."</p>
                     <p>Emily now fell at his feet, and, with tears of terror, ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for her aunt, who ſat, trembling with fear, and indignation; now ready to pour forth execrations, and now to join the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions of Emily, Montoni, however, ſoon interrupted theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties with an horrible oath; and, as he burſt from Emily, leaving his cloak in her hand, ſhe fell to the floor, with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> that occaſioned her a ſevere blow on the forehead. But he quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the room, without attempting to raiſe her, whoſe attention was called from herſelf by a deep groan from Madame Montoni, who continued otherwiſe unmoved in her chair, and had not fainted. Emily haſtening to her aſſiſtance, ſaw her eyes rolling and her features convulſed.</p>
                     <p>Having ſpoken to her, without receiving an anſwer, ſhe brought water, and ſupported her head, while ſhe held it to her lips; but the increaſing convulſions ſoon compelled Emily to call for aſſiſtance. On her way through the hall, in ſearch of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette, ſhe met Montoni, whom ſhe told what had happened, and conjured to return and comfort her aunt; but he turned ſilently away, with a look of indifference, and went out upon the ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts. At length ſhe found old Carlo and Annette, and they haſtened to the dreſſing room, where Madame Montoni <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> fallen on the floor, and was lying in ſtrong convulſions. Having lifted her into the adjoining room, and laid her on the bed, the force of her diſorder ſtill made all their ſtrength neceſſary to hold her, while Annette trembled and ſobbed, and old Carlo looked ſilently and piteouſly on, as his feeble hands graſped thoſe of his miſtreſs, till, turning his eyes upon Emily, he exclaimed, "Good God; Signora, what is the matter?"</p>
                     <p>Emily looked calmly at him, and ſaw his inquiring eyes fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on her: and Annette, locking up, ſcreamed loudly; for Emily's face was ſtained with blood, which continued to fall ſlowly from her forehead: but her attention had been ſo entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occupied by the ſcene before her, that ſhe had felt no pain from the wound. She now held an handkerchief to her face, and,
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:029378_0158_0FE082816FC42A28"/>
notwithſtanding her faintneſs, continued to watch Madame Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni, the violence of whoſe convulſions was abating, till at length they ceaſed, and left her in a kind of ſtupor.</p>
                     <p>"My aunt muſt remain quiet," ſaid Emily. "Go, good Carlo; if we ſhould want your aſſiſtance, I will ſend for you. In the meantime, if you have an opportunity, ſpeak kindly of your miſtreſs to your maſter."</p>
                     <p>"Alas!" ſaid Carlo, "I have ſeen too much! I have little influence with the Signor. But do, dear young lady, take ſome care of yourſelf; that is an ugly wound, and you look ſadly."</p>
                     <p>"Thank you, my friend, for your conſideration," ſaid Emily, ſmiling kindly: "the wound is trifling, it came by a fall."</p>
                     <p>Carlo ſhook his head, and left the room; and Emily, with Annette, continued to watch by her aunt. "Did my lady tell the Signor what Ludovico ſaid, ma'amſelle?" aſked Annette in a whiſper; but Emily quieted her fears on the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>"I thought what this quarrelling would come to," continued Annette: "I ſuppoſe the Signor has been beating my lady."</p>
                     <p>"No, no, Annette, you are totally miſtaken, nothing extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary has happened."</p>
                     <p>"Why extraordinary things happen here ſo often, ma'amſelle, that there is nothing in them. Here is another legion of thoſe ill looking fellows, come to the caſtle, this morning."</p>
                     <p>"Huſh! Annette, you will diſturb my aunt; we will talk of that by and bye."</p>
                     <p>They continued watching ſilently, till Madame Montoni ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered a low ſigh, when Emily took her hand, and ſpoke ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to her; but the former gazed with unconſcious eyes, and it was long before ſhe knew her niece. Her firſt words then inquired for Montoni; to which Emily replied by an entreaty, that ſhe would compoſe her ſpirits, and conſent to be kept quiet, adding, that, if ſhe wiſhed any meſſage to be conveyed to him, ſhe would herſelf deliver it. "No," ſaid her aunt faintly, "no—I have nothing new to tell him. Does he perſiſt in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I ſhall be removed from my chamber?"</p>
                     <p>Emily replied, that he had not ſpoken, on the ſubject, ſince Madame Montoni heard him; and then ſhe tried to divert her attention to ſome other topic; but her aunt ſeemed to be inat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to what ſhe ſaid, and loſt in ſecret thoughts. Emily hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought her ſome refreſhment, now leſt her to the care of Annette, and went in ſearch of Montoni, whom ſhe found on a remote part of the rampart, converſing among a group of the men deſcribed by Annette. They ſtood round him with fierce,
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:029378_0159_0FE0828C1EAC2088"/>
yet ſubjugated, looks, while he, ſpeaking earneſtly, and pointing to the walls, did not perceive Emily, who remained at ſome diſtance, waiting till he ſhould be at leiſure, and obſerving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntarily the appearance of one man, more ſavage than his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, who ſtood reſting on his pike, and looking, over the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of a comrade, at Montoni, to whom he liſtened with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common earneſtneſs. This man was apparently of low condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet his looks appeared not to acknowledge the ſuperiority of Montoni, as did thoſe of his companions; and ſometimes they even aſſumed an air of authority, which the deciſive man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Signor could not repreſs. Some few words of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni then paſſed in the wind; and, as the men were ſeparating, ſhe heard him ſay, "This evening, then, begin the watch at ſunſet."</p>
                     <p>"At ſunſet, Signor," replied one or two of them, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away; while Emily approached Montoni, who appeared de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of avoiding her: but, though ſhe obſerved this, ſhe had courage to proceed. She endeavoured to intercede once more for her aunt, repreſented to him her ſufferings, and urged the danger of expoſing her to a cold apartment in her preſent ſtate. "She ſuffers by her own folly," ſaid Montoni, "and is not to be pitied;—ſhe knows how ſhe may avoid theſe ſufferings in future—if ſhe is removed to the turret, it will be her own fault. Let her be obedient, and ſign the writings you heard of, and I will think no more of it."</p>
                     <p>When Emily ventured ſtill to plead, he ſternly ſilenced and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked her for interfering in his domeſtic affairs, but, at length, diſmiſſed her with this conceſſion—That he would not remove Madame Montoni, on the enſuing night, but allow her till the next to conſider, whether ſhe would reſign her ſettlements or be impriſoned in the eaſt turret of the caſtle, "where ſhe ſhall find," he added, "a puniſhment ſhe may not expect."</p>
                     <p>Emily then haſtened to inform her aunt of this ſhort reſpite and of the alternative, that awaited her, to which the latter made no reply, but appeared thoughtful, while Emily, in conſideration of her extreme languor, wiſhed to ſooth her mind by leading it to leſs intereſting topics: and, though theſe efforts were unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, and Madame Montoni became peeviſh, her reſolution, on the contended point, ſeemed ſomewhat to relax, and Emily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended as her only means of ſafety, that ſhe ſhould ſubmit to Montoni's demand. "You know not what you adviſe," ſaid her aunt. "Do you underſtand, that theſe eſtates will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to you at my death, if I perſiſt in a refuſal?"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="91" facs="unknown:029378_0159_0FE0828C1EAC2088"/>
"I was ignorant of that circumſtance, madam," replied Emily, "but the knowledge of it cannot withhold me from adviſing you to adopt the conduct, which not only your peace, but, I fear, your ſafety requires, and I entreat, that you will not ſuffer a conſideration comparatively ſo trifling, to make you heſitate a moment in reſigning them."</p>
                     <p>"Are you ſincere, niece?" "Is it poſſible you can doubt it, madam?" Her aunt appeared to be affected. "You are not unworthy of theſe eſtates, niece," ſaid ſhe: "I would wiſh to keep them for your ſake—you ſhew a virtue I did not expect."</p>
                     <p>"How have I deſerved this reproof, madam?" ſaid Emily ſorrowfully.</p>
                     <p>"Reproof!" replied Madame Montoni: "I meant to praiſe your virtue."</p>
                     <p>"Alas! here is no exertion of virtue," rejoined Emily, "for here is no temptation to be overcome."</p>
                     <p>"Yet Monſieur Valancourt"—ſaid her aunt. "O madam!" interrupted Emily, anticipating what ſhe would have ſaid, "do not let me glance on that ſubject: do not let my mind be ſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a wiſh ſo ſhockingly ſelf intereſted." She immediately changed the topic, and continued with Madame Montoni, till ſhe withdrew to her apartment for the night.</p>
                     <p>At that hour the caſtle was perfectly ſtill, and every inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of it, except herſelf, ſeemed to have retired to reſt. As ſhe pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ed along the wide and lonely galleries, duſky and ſilent, ſhe felt forlorn and apprehenſive of—ſhe ſcarcely knew what; but when, entering the corridor, ſhe recollected the incident of the preceding night, a dread ſeized her, leſt a ſubject of alarm, ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to that, which had befallen Annette, ſhould occur to her, and which, whether real, or ideal, would, ſhe felt, have an almoſt equal effect upon her weakened ſpirits. The chamber to which An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette had alluded, ſhe did not exactly know, but underſtood it to be one of thoſe ſhe muſt paſs in the way to her own; and, ſending a fearful look forward into the gloom, ſhe ſtepped light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and cautiouſly along, till coming to a door, from whence iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued a low ſound, ſhe heſitated and pauſed; and during the delay of that moment, her fears ſo much increaſed, that ſhe had no power to move from the ſpot. Believing, that ſhe heard a human-voice within, ſhe was ſomewhat revived; but in the next moment, the door was opened, and a perſon, whom ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be Montoni, appeared, who inſtantly ſtarted back, and cloſed it, though not before ſhe had ſeen, by the light that burned in the chamber another perſon, ſitting in a melancholy
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:029378_0160_0FE08290F238A0E0"/>
attitude by the fire. Her terror vaniſhed, but her aſtoniſhment only began, which was now rouſed by the myſterious ſecrecy of Montoni's manner, and by the diſcovery of a perſon, whom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e thus viſited at midnight, in an apartment which had long been ſhut up, and of which ſuch extraordinary reports were circulated.</p>
                     <p>While ſhe thus continued heſitating, ſtrongly prompted to watch Montoni's motions, yet fearing to irritate him by appearing to notice them, the door was again opened cautiouſly, and as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly cloſed as before. She then ſtepped ſoftly to her chamber, which was the next but one to this, but, having put down her lamp, returned to an obſcure corner of the corridor, to obſerve the proceedings of this half ſeen perſon, and to aſcertain, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was indeed Montoni.</p>
                     <p>Having waited in ſilent expectation for a few minutes, with her eyes fixed on the door, it was again opened, and the ſame perſon appeared, whom ſhe now knew to be Montoni. He look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cautiouſly round, without perceiving her, then, ſtepping for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, cloſed the door, and left the corridor. Soon after, Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heard the door faſtened on the inſide, and ſhe withdrew to her chamber, wondering at what ſhe had witneſſed.</p>
                     <p>It was now twelve o'clock. As ſhe cloſed her caſement, ſhe heard footſteps on the terrace below, and ſaw imperfectly, through the gloom ſeveral perſons advancing, who paſſed under the caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. She then heard the clink of arms, and, in the next mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the watchword; when, recollecting the command ſhe had overheard from Montoni, and the hour of the night, ſhe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that theſe men were for the firſt time, relieving guard in the caſtle. Having liſtened till all was again ſtill, ſhe retired to ſleep.</p>

                     <p>ON the following morning, Emily went early to the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Madame Montoni, who had ſlept well, and was much recovered. Her ſpirits alſo had returned with her health, and her reſolution to oppoſe Montoni's demands revived, though it yet ſtruggled with her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which Emily, who trembled for the conſequence of further oppoſition, endeavoured to confirm.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="93" facs="unknown:029378_0160_0FE08290F238A0E0"/>
Her aunt, as has been already ſhewn, had a diſpoſition, which delighted in contradiction, and which taught her, when unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant circumſtances were offered to her underſtanding, not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into their truth, but to ſeek for arguments, by which ſhe might make them appear falſe. Long habit had ſo entirely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed this natural propenſity, that ſhe was not conſcious of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing it. Emily's remonſtrances and repreſentations, therefore rouſed her pride, inſtead of alarming, or convincing her judgment, and ſhe ſtill relied upon the diſcovery of ſome means, by which ſhe might yet avoid ſubmitting to the demand of her huſband. Conſidering, that, if ſhe could once eſcape from his caſtle, ſhe might defy his power, and, obtaining a deciſive ſeparation, live in comfort on the eſtates, that yet remained for her, ſhe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned this to her niece, who accorded with her in the wiſh, but differed from her as to the probability of its completion. She repreſented the impoſſibility of paſſing the gates, ſecured and guarded as they were, and the extreme danger of committing her deſign to the diſcretion of a ſervant, who might either pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely betray, or accidentally diſcloſe it.—Montoni's vengeance would alſo diſdain reſtraint, if her intention was detected: and, though Emily wiſhed, as fervently as ſhe could do, to regain her freedom, and return to France, ſhe conſulted only Madame Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni's ſafety and perſevered in adviſing her to relinquiſh her ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, without braving further outrage.</p>
                     <p>The ſtruggle of contrary emotions, however, continued to rage in her aunt's boſom, and ſhe ſtill brooded over the chance of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting an eſcape. While ſhe thus ſat, Montoni entered the room, and, without noticing his wife's indiſpoſition, ſaid, that he came to remind her of the impolicy of trifling with him, and that he gave her only till the evening to determine, whether ſhe would conſent to his demand, or compel him, by a refuſal, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move her to the eaſt turret. He added, that a party of cavaliers would dine with him, that day, and that he expected ſhe would ſit at the head of the table, where Emily, alſo, muſt be preſent. Madame Montoni was now on the point of uttering an abſolute refuſal, but, ſuddenly conſidering, that her liberty, during this entertainment, though circumſcribed, might favour her further plans, ſhe acquieſced with ſeeming reluctance, and Montoni, ſoon after left the apartment. His command ſtruck Emily with ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe and apprehenſion, who ſhrunk from the thought of being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the gaze of ſtrangers, ſuch as her fancy repreſented theſe to be, and the words of Count Morano, now again recollected, did not ſooth her fears. When ſhe withdrew to prepare for din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:029378_0161_0FE0829DD88586E0"/>
ſhe dreſſed herſelf with even more ſimplicity than uſual, that ſhe might eſcape obſervation—a policy, which did not avail her, for, as ſhe repaſſed to her aunt's apartment, ſhe was met by Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni, who cenſured what he called her prudiſh appearance, and inſiſted, that ſhe would wear the moſt ſplendid dreſs ſhe had, even that, which had been prepared for her intended nuptials with Count Morano, and which, it now appeared, her aunt had care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully brought with her from Venice. This was made, not in the Venetian, but, in the Neapolitan faſhion, ſo as to ſet off the ſhape and figure, to the utmoſt advantage. In it, her beautiful cheſnut treſſes were negligently bound up in pearls, and ſuffered to fall back again on her neck. The ſimplicity of a better taſte, than Madame Montoni's, was conſpicuous in this dreſs, ſplendid as it was, and Emily's unaffected beauty never had appeared more captivatingly. She had now only to hope, that Montoni's order was prompted, not by any extraordinary deſign, but by an oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of diſplaying his family, richly attired, to the eyes of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; yet nothing leſs than his abſolute command could have prevailed with her to wear a dreſs, that had been deſigned for ſuch an offenſive purpoſe, much leſs to have worn it on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. As ſhe deſcended to dinner, the emotion of her mind threw a faint bluſh over her countenance, and heightened its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting expreſſion; for timidity had made her linger in her apartment, till the utmoſt moment, and, when ſhe entered the hall, in which a kind of ſtate dinner was ſpread, Montoni and his gueſts were already ſeated at the table. She was then going to place herſelf by her aunt; but Montoni waved his hand, and two of the cavaliers roſe, and ſeated her between them.</p>
                     <p>The eldeſt of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſe was a tall man, with ſtrong Italian features, an aquiline noſe, and dark penetrating eyes, that flaſhed with fire, when his mind was agitated, and even in its ſtate of reſt, retained ſomewhat of the wildneſs of the paſſions. His viſage was long and narrow, and his complexion of a ſickly yellow.</p>
                     <p>The other, who appeared to be about forty, had features of a different caſt, yet Italian, and his look was ſlow, ſubtle and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etrating; his eyes, of a dark gray, were ſmall, and hollow; his complexion was a ſunburnt brown, and the cantour of his face, though inclined to oval, was irregular and ill-formed.</p>
                     <p>Eight other gueſts ſat round the table, who were all dreſſed in an uniform, and had all an expreſſion, more or leſs, of wild fierceneſs, of ſubtle deſign, or of licentious paſſions. As Emily timidly ſurveyed them, ſhe remembered the ſcene of the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing morning, and again almoſt fancied herſelf ſurrounded by
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:029378_0161_0FE0829DD88586E0"/>
banditti; then, looking back to the tranquillity of her early life, ſhe felt ſcarcely leſs aſtoniſhment, than grief, at her preſent ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The ſcene, in which they ſat, aſſiſted the alluſion; it was an ancient hall, gloomy from the ſtyle of its architecture, from its great extent, and becauſe almoſt the only light it received was from one large gothic window, and from a pair of folding doors, which, being open, admitted likewiſe a view of the weſt rampart, with the wild mountains of the Apennine beyond.</p>
                     <p>The middle compartment of this hall roſe into a vaulted roof, enriched with fret work, and ſupported, on three ſides, by pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of marble; beyond theſe, long colonades retired in gloomy grandeur, till their extent was loſt in twilight. The lighteſt footſteps of the ſervants, as they advanced through theſe, were returning in whiſpering echoes, and their figures ſeen at a diſtance imperfectly through the duſk, frequently awakened Emily's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agination. She looked alternately at Montoni, at his gueſts and on the ſurrounding ſcene; and then, remembering her dear na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive province, her pleaſant home and the ſimplicity and goodneſs of the friends, whom ſhe had loſt, grief and ſurpriſe again oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied her mind.</p>
                     <p>When her thoughts could return from theſe conſiderations, ſhe fancied ſhe obſerved an air of authority towards his gueſts, ſuch as ſhe never had before ſeen him aſſume, though he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been diſtinguiſhed by an haughty carriage; there was ſomething alſo in the manners of the ſtrangers, that ſeemed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, though not ſervilely, to acknowledge his ſuperiority.</p>
                     <p>During dinner, the converſation was chiefly on war and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics. They talked with energy of the ſtate of Venice, its dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, the character of the reigning Doge and of the chief ſenators; and then ſpoke of the ſtate o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Rome. When the repaſt was over, they roſe, and, each filling his goblet with wine from the gilded ewer, that ſtood beſide him, drank "Succeſs to our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits!" Montoni was lifting his goblet to his lips to drink this toaſt, when ſuddenly the wine hiſſed, roſe to the brim, and, as he held the glaſs from him, it burſt into a thouſand pieces.</p>
                     <p>To him, who conſtantly uſed that ſort of Venice glaſs, which had the quality of breaking, upon receiving poiſoned liquor, a ſuſpicion, that ſome of his gueſts had endeavoured to betray him, inſtantly occurred, and he ordered all the gates to be cloſed, drew his ſword, and, looking round on them, who ſtood in ſilent amazement, exclaimed, "Here is a traitor among us; let thoſe that are innocent, aſſiſt in diſcovering the guilty."</p>
                     <p>Indignation flaſhed from the eyes of the cavaliers, who all drew their ſwords; and Madame Montoni, terrified at what
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:029378_0162_0FE082A27B78C310"/>
might enſue, was haſtening from the hall, when her huſband commanded her to ſtay; but his further words could not now be diſtinguiſhed, for the voice of every perſon roſe together. His order, that all the ſervants ſhould appear, was at length obeyed, and they declared their ignorance of any deceit—a proteſtation which could not be believed; for it was evident, that, as Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni's liquor, and his only, had been poiſoned, a deliberate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign had been formed againſt his life, which could not have been carried ſo far towards its accompliſhment, without the connivance of the ſervant, who had the care of the wine ewers.</p>
                     <p>This man, with another, whoſe face betrayed either the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of guilt, or the fear of puniſhment, Montoni ordered to be chained inſtantly, and confined in a ſtrong room, which had formerly been uſed as a priſon. Thither, likewiſe, he would have ſent all his gueſts, had he not foreſeen the conſequence of ſo bold and unjuſtifiable a proceeding. As to thoſe, therefore, he contented himſelf with ſwearing, that no man ſhould paſs the gates, till this extraordinary affair had been inveſtigated, and then ſternly bade his wife retire to her apartment, whither he ſuffered Emily to attend her.</p>
                     <p>In about half an hour, he followed to the dreſſing room; and Emily obſerved, with horror, his dark countenance and quiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lip, and heard him denounce vengeance on her aunt.</p>
                     <p>"It will avail you nothing," ſaid he to his wife, for a moment to deny the fact; I have proof of your guilt. Your only chance of mercy reſts on a full confeſſion;—there is nothing to hope from ſullenneſs or falſehood; your accomplice has confeſſed all."</p>
                     <p>Emily's fainting ſpirits were rouſed by aſtoniſhment, as ſhe heard her aunt accuſed of a crime ſo atrocious, and ſhe could not admit the poſſibility of her guilt. Meanwhile Madame Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni's agitation did not permit her to reply; alternately her complexion varied from livid paleneſs to a crimſon fluſh; and ſhe trembled,—but, whether with fear, or with indignation, it were difficult to decide.</p>
                     <p>"Spare your words," ſaid Montoni, ſeeing her about to ſpeak," your countenance makes full confeſſion of your crime.—You ſhall be inſtantly removed to the eaſt turret."</p>
                     <p>"This accuſation," ſaid Madame Montoni, ſpeaking with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, "is uſed only as an excuſe for your cruelty; I diſdain to reply to it. You do not believe me guilty."</p>
                     <p>"Signor!" ſaid Emily ſolemnly, "this dreadful charge I would anſwer with my life, is falſe. Nay, Signor," ſhe added, obſerving the ſeverity of his countenance, "this is no moment
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:029378_0162_0FE082A27B78C310"/>
for reſtraint on my part; I do not ſcruple to tell you, that you are deceived—moſt wickedly deceived, by the ſuggeſtion of ſome perſon, who aims at the ruin of my aunt: it is impoſſible, that you could yourſelf have imagined a crime ſo hideous."</p>
                     <p>Montoni, his lips trembling more than before, replied only, "If you value your own ſafety," addreſſing Emily, "you will be ſilent. I ſhall know how to interpret your remonſtrances, ſhould you perſevere in them."</p>
                     <p>Emily raiſed her eyes calmy to heaven. "Here is, indeed, then, nothing to hope!" ſaid ſhe.</p>
                     <p>"Peace!" cried Montoni, "or you ſhall find there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to fear."</p>
                     <p>He turned to his wife, who had now recovered her ſpirits, and who vehemently and wildly remonſtrated upon this myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſuſpicion: but Montoni's rage heightened with her indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Emily, dreading the event of it, threw herſelf between them, and claſped his knees in ſilence, looking up in his face with an expreſſion that might have ſoftened the heart of a fiend.—Whether his was hardened by a conviction of Madame Montoni's guilt, or that a bare ſuſpicion of it made him eager to exerciſe vengeance, he was totally and alike inſenſible to the diſtreſs of his wife, and to the pleading looks of Emily, whom he made no attempt to raiſe, but was vehemently menacing both, when he was called out of the room by ſome perſon at the door. As he ſhut the door, Emily heard him turn the lock and take out the key; ſo that Madame Montoni and herſelf were now priſoners; and ſhe ſaw that his deſigns became more and more terrible.—Her endeavours to explain his motives for this circumſtance were almoſt as ineffectual as thoſe to ſooth the diſtreſs of her aunt, whoſe innocence ſhe could not doubt; but ſhe, at length, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for Montoni's readineſs to ſuſpect his wife by his own conſciouſneſs of cruelty towards her, and for the ſudden violence of his preſent conduct againſt both, before even his ſuſpicions could be completely formed, by his general eagerneſs to effect ſuddenly whatever he was led to deſire and his careleſſneſs of juſtice, or humanity, in accompliſhing it.</p>
                     <p>Madame Montoni, after ſometime, again looked round, in ſearch of a poſſibility of eſcape from the caſtle, and converſed with Emily on the ſubject, who was now willing to encounter any hazard, though ſhe forbore to encourage a hope in her aunt, which ſhe herſelf did not admit. How ſtrongly the edifice was ſecured, and how vigilantly guarded, ſhe knew too well; and trembled to commit their ſafety to the caprice of the ſervant,
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:029378_0163_0FE082AFB8364628"/>
whoſe aſſiſtance they muſt ſolicit. Old Carlo was compaſſionate, but he ſeemed to be too much in his maſter's intereſt to be truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them; Annette could of herſelf do little, and Emily knew Ludovico only from her report. At preſent, however, theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations were uſeleſs, Madame Montoni and her niece being ſhut up from all intercourſe, even with the perſons, whom there might be theſe reaſons to reject.</p>
                     <p>In the hall, confuſion and tumult ſtill reigned. Emily, as ſhe liſtened anxiouſly to the murmur, that ſounded along the gallery, ſometimes fancied ſhe heard the claſhing of ſwords, and, when ſhe conſidered the nature of the provocation, given by Montoni, and his impetuoſity, it appeared probable, that nothing leſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> arms would terminate the contention. Madame Montoni having exhauſted all her expreſſions of indignation, and Emily hers of comfort, they remained ſilent, in that kind of breathleſs ſtillneſs, which, in nature, often ſucceeds to the uproar of conflicting ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; a ſtillneſs, like the morning, that dawns upon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>An uncertain kind of terror pervaded Emily's mind; the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the paſt hour ſtill came dimly and confuſedly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>From this ſtate of waking viſions ſhe was recalled by a knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the chamber door, and inquring who was there, heard <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

"Fly!" cried Emily, "fly! we cannot open the door."</p>
                     <p>Annette repeated, that they were coming, and in the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fled.</p>
                     <p>"Be calm, madam," ſaid Emily, turning to her aunt. "I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you be calm, I am not frightened—not frightened in the leaſt, do not you be alarmed."</p>
                     <p>"You can ſcarcely ſupport yourſelf," replied her aunt; "Merciful God! what is it they mean to do with us?"</p>
                     <p>"They come perhaps to liberate us," ſaid Emily, "Signor Montoni perhaps is—is conquered."</p>
                     <p>The belief of his death gave her ſpirits a ſudden ſhock, and ſhe grew faint as ſhe ſaw him in imagination, expiring at her feet.</p>
                     <p>"They are coming!" cried Madame Montoni—" I hear their ſteps—they are at the door!"</p>
                     <p>Emily turned her languid eyes to the door, but terror depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her of utterance. The key ſounded in the lock; the door opened, and Montoni appeared, followed by three ruffian-like men. "Execute your orders," ſaid he, turning to them, and pointing to his wife, who ſhrieked, but was immediately carried from the room; while Emily, ſunk, ſenſeleſs, on a couch, by which ſhe had endeavoured to ſupport herſelf. When ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, ſhe was alone, and recollected only, that Madame Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni had been there, together with ſome unconnected particulars of the preceding tranſaction, which were, however, ſufficient to renew all her terror. She looked wildly round the apartment, as if in ſearch of ſome means of intelligence, concerning her aunt, while neither her own danger, or an idea of eſcaping from the room, immediately occurred.</p>
                     <p>When her recollection was more complete, ſhe raiſed herſelf and went, but with only a faint hope, to examine whether the door was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>faſtened. It was ſo, and ſhe then ſtepped timidly out into the gallery, but pauſed there, uncertain which way ſhe ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>. Her firſt wiſh was to gather ſome information, as to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">
                           <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and ſhe, at length, turned her ſteps to go to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">
                           <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, where Annette and the other ſervants uſually waited.</p>
                     <p>Every where, as ſhe paſſed, ſhe heard, from a diſtance, the uproar of contention, and the figures and faces, which ſhe met, hurrying along the paſſages, ſtruck her mind with diſmay. Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily might now have appeared, like an angel of light, encompaſſed by fiends. At length, ſhe reached the leſſer hall, which was ſilent and deſerted, but, panting for breath, ſhe ſat down to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover herſelf. The total ſtillneſs of this place was as awful as the tumult, from which ſhe had eſcaped: but ſhe had now time
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:029378_0164_0FE083BFE4ECE180"/>
to recall her ſcattered thoughts, to remember her perſonal dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and to conſider of ſome means of ſafety. She perceived, that it was uſeleſs to ſeek Madame Montoni, through the wide extent and intricacies of the caſtle, now, too, when every avenue ſeemed to be beſet by ruffians; in this hall ſhe could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to ſtay, for ſhe knew not how ſoon it might become their place of rendezvous; and, though ſhe wiſhed to go to her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſhe dreaded again to encounter them on the way.</p>
                     <p>Thus ſhe ſat trembling and heſitating, when a diſtant mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur broke on the ſilence, and grew louder and louder, till ſhe diſtinguiſhed voices and ſteps approaching. She then roſe to go, but the ſounds came along the only paſſage, by which ſhe could depart, and ſhe was compelled to await in the hall, the arrival of the perſons, whoſe ſteps ſhe heard. As theſe advanced, ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed groans, and then ſaw a man borne ſlowly along by four others. Her ſpirits faltered at the ſight, and ſhe leaned againſt the wall for ſupport. The bearers, meanwhile, entered the hall, and, being too buſily occupied to detain, or even notice Emily, ſhe attempted to leave it, but her ſtrength failed, and ſhe again ſat down on the bench. A damp chillneſs came over her; her ſight became confuſed; ſhe knew not what had paſſed, or where ſhe was, yet the groans of the wounded perſon ſtill vibrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on her heart. In a few moments, the tide of life ſeemed again to flow; ſhe began to breathe more freely, and her ſenſes revived. She had not fainted, nor had ever totally loſt her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs, but had contrived to ſupport herſelf on the bench; ſtill without courage to turn her eyes upon the unfortunate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which remained near her, and about whom the men were yet too much engaged to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> to her.</p>
                     <p>When her ſtrength returned, ſhe roſe, and was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> to leave the hall, though her anxiety, having produced <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> vain inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries concerning Madame Montoni, had thus made a diſcovery of herſelf. Towards her chamber ſhe now haſtened, as faſt as her ſteps would bear her, for ſhe ſtill perceived, upon her paſſage, the ſounds of confuſion at a diſtance, and ſhe endeavoured, by taking her way through ſome obſcure rooms, to avoid encount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering the perſons, whoſe looks had terrified her before, as well as thoſe parts of the caſtle, where the tumult ſtill raged.</p>
                     <p>At length, ſhe reached her chamber, and, having ſecured the door of the corridor, felt herſelf, for a moment, in ſafety. A profound ſtillneſs reigned in this remote apartment, which not even the faint murmur of the moſt diſtant ſounds now reached. She ſat down, near one of the caſements, and, as ſhe gazed on
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:029378_0164_0FE083BFE4ECE180"/>
the mountain view beyond, the deep repoſe of its beauty ſtruck her with all the force of contraſt, and ſhe could ſcarcely believe herſelf ſo near a ſcene of ſavage diſcord. The contending ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſeemed to have retired from their natural ſpheres, and to have collected themſelves into the minds of men, for there alone the tempeſt now reigned.</p>
                     <p>Emily tried to tranquillize her ſpirits, but anxiety made her conſtantly liſten for ſome ſound, and often look out upon the ramparts, where all, however, was lonely and ſtill. As a ſenſe of her own immediate danger had decreaſed, her apprehenſion concerning Madame Montoni heightened, who, ſhe remembered, had been fiercely threatened with confinement in the eaſt turret, and it was poſſible, that her huſband had ſatisfied his preſent vengeance with this puniſhment. She, therefore, determined, when night ſhould return, and the inhabitants of the caſtle ſhould be aſleep, to explore the way to the turret, which, as the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſtood in was mentioned, appeared not very difficult to be done. She knew, indeed, that although her aunt might be there, ſhe could afford her no effectual aſſiſtance, but it might give her ſome comfort even to know, that ſhe was diſcovered, and to hear the ſound of her niece's voice; for herſelf, any certainty, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Madame Montoni's fate, appeared mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> tolerable than this exhauſting ſuſpenſe.</p>
                     <p>Meanwhile, Annette did not appear, and Emily was ſurpriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſomewhat alarmed for her, whom, in the confuſion of the late ſcene, various accidents might have befallen, and it was improbable, that ſhe would have failed to come to her apartment, unleſs ſomething unfortunate had happened.</p>
                     <p>Thus the hours paſſed in ſolitude, in ſilence, and in anxious conjecturing. Being not once diſturbed by a meſſage, or a ſound, it appeared, that Montoni had wholly forgotten her, and it gave her ſome comfort to find, that ſhe could be ſo unnoticed. She endeavoured to withdraw her thoughts from the anxiety, that preyed upon them, but they refuſed control; ſhe could neither read, or draw, and the tones of her lute were ſo utterly diſcord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant with the preſent ſtate of her feelings, that ſhe could not endure them for a moment.</p>
                     <p>The ſun, at length, ſet behind the weſtern mountains; his fiery beams <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aded from the clouds, and then a dun melancholy purple drew over them, and gradually involved the features of the country below. Soon after, the ſentinels paſſed on the ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to commence the watch.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="102" facs="unknown:029378_0165_0FE082C35CC203C8"/>
Twilight had now ſpread its gloom over every object; the diſmal obſcurity of her chamber recalled fearful thoughts, but ſhe remembered, that to procure a light ſhe muſt paſs through a great extent of the caſtle, and, above all, through the halls, where ſhe had already experienced ſo much horror. Darkneſs, indeed, in the preſent ſtate of her ſpirits, made ſilence and ſolitude ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to her; it would alſo prevent the poſſibility of her finding her way to the turret, and condemn her to remain in ſuſpenſe, concerning the fate of her aunt; yet ſhe dared not to venture forth for a lamp.</p>
                     <p>Continuing at the caſement, that ſhe might catch the laſt lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering gleam of evening, a thouſand vague images of fear floated on her fancy. "What if ſome of theſe ruffians," ſaid ſhe," ſhould find out the private ſtaircaſe, and in the darkneſs of night ſteal into my chamber!" Then, recollecting the myſterious inhabitant of the neighbouring apartment, her terror changed its object. "He is not a priſoner," ſaid ſhe, "though he remains in one cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, for Montoni did not faſten the door when he left i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>; the unknown perſon himſelf did this; it is certain, therefore, he can come out when he pleaſes."</p>
                     <p>She pauſed, for, notwithſtanding <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he terrors of darkneſs, ſhe conſidered it to be very improbable, whoever he was, that he could have any intereſt in intruding upon her retirement; and again the ſubject of her emotion changed, when, remembering her nearneſs to the chamber, where the veil had formerly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed a dreadful ſpectacle, ſhe doubted whether ſome paſſage might not communicate between it and the inſecure door of the ſtaircaſe.</p>
                     <p>It was now entirely dark, and ſhe left the caſement. As ſhe ſat with her eyes fixed on the hearth, ſhe thought ſhe perceived there a ſpark of light: it twinkled and diſappeared, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n again was viſible. At length, with much care, ſhe fanned the embers of a wood <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ire, that had been lighted in the morning, into flame, and having communicated it to a lamp, which always ſtood in her room, felt a ſatisfaction not to be conceived, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a review of her ſituation. Her firſt care was to guard the door of the ſtaircaſe, for which purpoſe ſhe placed againſt it all the furniture ſhe could move, and ſhe was thus employed, for ſometime, at the end of which ſhe had another inſtance how much more oppreſſive misfortune is to the idle, than to the buſy; for, having then leiſure to think over all the circumſtances of her preſent afflictions, ſhe imagined a thouſand evils for futurity, and theſe real and ideal ſubjects of diſtreſs alike wounded her mind,
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:029378_0165_0FE082C35CC203C8"/>
Thus heavily moved the hours till midnight, when ſhe counted the ſullen notes of the great clock, as they rolled along the ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, unmingled with any ſound, except the diſtant footfall of a ſentinel, who came to relieve guard. She now thought ſhe might venture towards the turret, and, having gently opened the chamber door to examine the corridor, and to liſten if any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was ſtirring in the caſtle, found all around in perfect ſtillneſs. Yet no ſooner had ſhe left the room, than ſhe perceived a light flaſh on the walls of the corridor, and, without waiting to ſee by whom it was carried, ſhe ſhrunk back, and cloſed her door. No one approaching, ſhe conjectured, that it was Montoni going to pay his midnight viſit to her unknown neighbour, and ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to wait, till he ſhould have retired to his own apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>When the chimes had tolled another half hour, ſhe once more opened the door, and, perceiving that no perſon was in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridor, haſtily croſſed into a paſſage, that led along the ſouth ſide of the caſtle towards the ſtaircaſe, whence ſhe believed ſhe could eaſily find her way to the turret. Often pauſing on her way, liſtening apprehenſively to the murmurs of the wind, and looking fearfully onward into the gloom of the long paſſages, ſhe at length reached the ſtaircaſe; but there her perplexity began. Two paſſages appeared, of which ſhe knew not how to prefer one, and was compelled, at laſt to decide by chance, rather than by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. That ſhe entered, opened firſt into a wide gallery, along which ſhe paſſed lightly and ſwiftly; for the lonely aſpect of the place awed her, and ſhe ſtarted at the echo of her own ſteps.</p>
                     <p>On a ſudden, ſhe thought ſhe heard a voice, and, not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing from whence it came, feared equally to proceed, or to return. For ſome moments, ſhe ſtood in an attitude of liſtening ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, ſhrinking almoſt from herſelf and ſcarcely daring to look round her. The voice came again, but, though it was now near her, terror did not allow her to judge exactly whence it proceeded. She though<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, however, that it was the voice of complaint, and her belief was ſoon confirmed by a low moaning ſound, that ſeemed to proceed from one of the chambers, opening into the gallery. It inſtantly occurred to her, that Madame Montoni might be there confined, and ſhe advanced to the door to ſpeak, but was checked by conſidering, that ſhe was, perhaps, going to commit herſelf to a ſtranger, who might diſcover her to Montoni; for, though this perſon, whoever it was, ſeemed to be in affliction, it did not follow, that he was a priſoner.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="104" facs="unknown:029378_0166_0FE082C83874E950"/>
While theſe thoughts paſſed over her mind, and left her ſtill in heſitation, the voice ſpoke again, and, calling "Ludovico," ſhe then perceived it to be that of Annette; on which, no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger heſitating, ſhe went in joy to anſwer her.</p>
                     <p>"Ludovico!" cried Annette, ſobbing—"Ludovico!"</p>
                     <p>"It is I," ſaid Emily, trying to open the door. "How came you here? Who ſhut you up?"</p>
                     <p>"Ludovico!" repeated Annette—"O Ludovico!"</p>
                     <p>"It is not Ludovico, it is I—Mademoiſelle Emily."</p>
                     <p>Annette ceaſed ſobbing, and was ſilent.</p>
                     <p>"If you can open the door, let me in," ſaid Emily, "here is no perſon to hurt you."</p>
                     <p>"Ludovico!—O, Ludovico!" cried Annette.</p>
                     <p>Emily now loſt her patience, and, her fear of being overheard increaſing, ſhe was even nearly about to leave the door, when ſhe conſidered, that Annette might, poſſibly, know ſomething of the ſituation of Madame Montoni, or direct her to the turret.—At length, ſhe obtained a reply, though little ſatisfactory to her queſtions, for Annette knew nothing of Madame Montoni, and only conjured Emily to tell her what was become of Ludovico. Of him ſhe had no information to give, and ſhe again aſked who had ſhut Annette up.</p>
                     <p>"Ludovico," ſaid the poor girl, "Ludovico ſhut me up.—When I ran away from the dreſſing room door to day I went, I ſcarcely knew where, for ſafety; and, in this gallery, here, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Ludovico, who hurried me into this chamber, and locked me up to keep me out of harm, as he ſaid. But he was in ſuch a hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry himſelf, he hardly ſpoke ten words, but he told me he would come, and let me out, when all was quiet, and he took away the key with him. Now all theſe hours are paſſed, and I have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeen, or heard a word of him; they have murdered him—I know they have!"</p>
                     <p>Emily ſuddenly remembered the wounded perſon, whom ſhe had ſeen borne into the ſervants' hall, and ſhe ſcarcely doubted, that he was Ludovico, but ſhe concealed the circumſtance from Annette, and endeavoured to comfort her. Then, impatient to learn ſomething of her aunt, ſhe again inquired the way to the turret.</p>
                     <p>"O! you are not going, ma'amſelle," ſaid Annette, "for Heaven's ſake, do not go, and leave me here by myſelf."</p>
                     <p>"Nay, Annette, you do not think I can wait in the gallery all night," replied Emily. "Direct me to the turret; in the morning I will endeavour to releaſe you."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="105" facs="unknown:029378_0166_0FE082C83874E950"/>
"O holy Mary!" exclaimed Annette, "am I to ſtay here by myſelf all night! I ſhall be frightened out of my ſenſes, and I ſhall die of hunger; I have had nothing to eat ſince dinner!"</p>
                     <p>Emily could ſcarcely forbear ſmiling at the heterogeneous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes of Annette, though ſhe ſincerely pitied them, and ſaid what ſhe could to ſooth her. At length, ſhe obtained ſomething like a direction to the eaſt turret, and quitted the door, from whence, after many intricacies, and perplexities, ſhe reached the ſteep and winding ſtairs of the turret, at the foot of which ſhe ſtopped to reſt, and to reanimate her courage with a ſenſe of her duty. As ſhe ſurveyed this diſmal place, ſhe perceived a door on the oppoſite ſide of the ſtaircaſe, and, anxious to know whether it would lead her to Madame Montoni, ſhe tried to undraw the bolts, which faſtened it. A freſher air came to her face, as ſhe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed the door, which opened upon the eaſt rampart, and the ſudden current had nearly extinguiſhed her light, which ſhe now removed to a diſtance; and again, looking out upon the obſcure terrace, ſhe perceived only the faint outline of the walls and of ſome towers, while, above, heavy clouds, borne along the wind, ſeemed to mingle with the ſtars, and wrap the night in thicker darkneſs. As ſhe gazed, now willing to defer the moment of certainty, from which ſhe expected only confirmation of evil, a diſtant footſtep reminded her, that ſhe might be obſerved by the men on watch; and, haſtily cloſing the door, ſhe took her lamp, and paſſed up the ſtaircaſe. Trembling came upon her, as ſhe aſcended through the gloom. To her melancholy fancy this ſeemed to be a place of death, and the chilling ſilence, that reigned, confirmed its character. Her ſpirits faltered. "Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps," ſaid ſhe, "I am come hither only to learn a dreadful truth, or to witneſs ſome horrible ſpectacle; I feel that my ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes would not ſurvive ſuch an addition of horror."</p>
                     <p>The image of her aunt murdered—murdered, perhaps, by the hand of Montoni, roſe to her mind; ſhe trembled, gaſped for breath—repented that ſhe had dared to venture hither, and checked her ſteps. But, after ſhe had pauſed a few minutes, the conſciouſneſs of her duty returned, and ſhe went on. Still all was ſilent. At length a track of blood, upon a ſtair, caught her eye; and inſtantly ſhe perceived, that the wall and ſeveral other ſteps were ſtained. She pauſed, again ſtruggled to ſupport herſelf, and the lamp almoſt fell from her trembling hand.—Still no ſound was heard, no living being ſeemed to inhabit the turret; a thouſand times ſhe wiſhed herſelf again in her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; dreaded to inquire farther—dreaded to encounter ſome hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:029378_0167_0FE082D3ECBB6698"/>
ſpectacle, and yet could not reſolve, now that ſhe was ſo near the termination of her efforts, to deſiſt from them. Having again recollected courage to proceed, after aſcending about half way up the turret, ſhe came to another door, but here again ſhe ſtopped in heſitation; liſtened for ſounds within, and then, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning all her reſolution, uncloſed it, and entered a chamber, which, as her lamp ſhot its feeble rays through the darkneſs, ſeemed to exhibit only dew-ſtained and deſerted walls. As ſhe ſtood examining it, in fearful expectation of diſcovering the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of her unfortunate aunt, ſhe perceived ſomething lying in an obſcure corner of the room, and ſtruck with an horrible convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhe became, for an inſtant, motionleſs and nearly inſenſible. Then, with a kind of deſperate reſolution, ſhe hurried towards <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he object that excited her terror, when, perceiving the clothes of ſome perſon, on the floor, the caught hold of them, and found in her graſp <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he old uniform of a ſoldier, beneath which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a heap of pikes and other arms. Scarcely daring to truſt her ſight, ſhe continued, for ſome moments, to gaze on the object of her late alarm, and then left the chamber, ſo much comforted and occupied by the conviction, that her aunt was not there, that ſhe was going to deſcend the turret, without inquiring far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; when, on turning to do ſo, ſhe obſerved upon ſome ſteps on the ſecond flight an appearance of blood, and remembering, that there was yet another chamber to be explored, ſhe again followed the windings of the aſcent. Still, as ſhe aſcended, the track of blood glared upon the ſtairs.</p>
                     <p>It led her to the door of a landing place, that terminated them, but ſhe was unable to follow it farther. Now that ſhe was ſo near the ſought-for certainty, ſhe dreaded to know it, even more than before, and had not fortitude ſufficient to ſpeak, or to attempt opening the door.</p>
                     <p>Having liſtened in vain, for ſome ſound, that might confirm or deſtroy her fears, ſhe, at length, laid her hand on the lock, and, finding it faſtened, called on Madame Montoni; but only a chilling ſilence enſued.</p>
                     <p>"She is dead!" ſhe cried,—"murdered!—her blood is on the ſtairs!"</p>
                     <p>Emily grew very faint; could ſupport herſelf no longer, and had ſcarcely preſence of mind to ſet down the lamp, and place her<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelf on a ſtep.</p>
                     <p>When her recollection returned, ſhe ſpoke again at the door, and again attempted to open it, and, having lingered for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time without receiving any anſwer, or hearing a ſound, ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:029378_0167_0FE082D3ECBB6698"/>
the turret, and, with all the ſwiftneſs her feebleneſs would permit ſought her own apartment.</p>
                     <p>As ſhe turned into the corridor, the door of a chamber open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from whence Montoni came forth; but Emily, more terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied than ever to behold him, ſhrunk back into the paſſage ſoon enough to eſcape being noticed, and heard him cloſe the door, which ſhe had perceived was the ſame ſhe formerly obſerved. Having here liſtened to his departing ſteps, till their faint ſound was loſt in diſtance, ſhe ventured to her apartment, and, ſecuring it once again, retired to her bed, leaving the lamp burning on the hearth. But ſleep was fled from her haraſſed mind, to which images of horror alone occurred. She endeavoured to think it poſſible, that Madame Montoni had not been taken to the turret; but, when ſhe recollected the former menaces of her huſband and the terrible ſpirit of vengeance, which he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played on the late occaſion; when ſhe remembered his general character, the looks of the men, who had forced Madame Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni from her apartment, and the written traces on the ſtairs of the turret—ſhe could not doubt, that her aunt had been carried thither, and could ſcarcely hope, that ſhe had not been carried to be murdered.</p>
                     <p>The gray of morning had long dawned through her caſements, before Emily cloſed her eyes in ſleep; when wearied nature, at length, yielded her a reſpite from ſuffering.</p>

                     <p>EMILY remained in her chamber, on the following morning, without receiving any notice from Montoni, or ſeeing a human being, except the armed men, who ſometimes paſſed on the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race below. Having taſted no food ſince the dinner of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding day, extreme faintneſs made her feel the neceſſity of quitting the aſſylum of her apartment to obtain refreſhment, and ſhe was alſo very anxious to procure liberty for Annette. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, however, to defer venturing forth, as long as poſſible, and conſidering, whether ſhe ſhould apply to Montoni, or to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion

of ſome other perſon, her exceſſive anxiety concerning her aunt, at length, overcame her abhorrence of his preſence, and ſhe determined to go to him, and to entreat, that he would ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer her to ſee Madame Montoni.</p>
                     <p>Meanwhile, it was too certain, from the abſence of Annette, that ſome accident had befallen Ludovico, and that ſhe was ſtill in confinement; Emily, therefore, reſolved alſo to viſit the chamber, where ſhe had ſpoken to her, on the preceding night, and, if the poor girl was yet there, to inform Montoni of her ſituation.</p>
                     <p>It was near noon, before ſhe ventured from her apartment, and went firſt to the ſouth gallery, whither ſhe paſſed without meeting a ſingle perſon, or hearing a ſound, except, now and then, the echo of a diſtant footſtep.</p>
                     <p>It was unneceſſary to call Annette, whoſe lamentations were audible upon the firſt approach to the gallery, and who, bewail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her own and Ludovico's fate, told Emily, that ſhe ſhould certainly be ſtarved to death, if ſhe was not let out immediately. Emily replied, that ſhe was going to beg her releaſe of Montoni; but the terrors of hunger now yielded to thoſe of the Signor, and, when Emily left her, ſhe was loudly entreating, that her place of refuge might be concealed from him.</p>
                     <p>As Emily drew near the great hall, the ſounds ſhe heard and the people ſhe met in the paſſages renewed her alarm. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, however, were peaceable, and did not interrupt her, though they looked earneſtly at her, as ſhe paſſed, and ſometimes ſpoke. On croſſing the hall towards the cedar room, where Montoni uſually ſat, ſhe perceived on the pavement, fragments of ſwords, ſome tattered garments ſtained with blood, and almoſt expected to have ſeen among them a dead body; but from ſuch a ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle ſhe was, at preſent, ſpared. As ſhe approached the room, the ſound of ſeveral voices iſſued from within, and a dread of appearing before many ſtrangers, as well as of irritating Montoni by ſuch an intruſion, made her pauſe and falter from her purpoſe. She looked up through the long arcades of the hall, in ſearch of a ſervant, who might bear a meſſage, but no one appeared, and the urgency of what ſhe had to requeſt made her ſtill linger near the door. The voices within were not in contention, though ſhe diſtinguiſhed thoſe of ſeveral of the gueſts of the preceding day; but ſtill her reſolution ſailed, whenever ſhe would have tapped at the door, and ſhe had determined to walk in the hall, till ſome perſon ſhould appear, who might call Montoni from the room, when, as ſhe turned from the door, it was ſuddenly opened by
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:029378_0168_0FE082D9B4B06F10"/>
himſelf. Emily trembled, and was confuſed, while he almoſt ſtarted with ſurpriſe, and all the terrors of his countenance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded themſelves. She forgot all ſhe would have ſaid, and neither inquired for her aunt, nor entreated for Annette, but ſtood ſilent and embarraſſed.</p>
                     <p>After cloſing the door he reproved her for a meanneſs, of which ſhe had not been guilty, and ſternly queſtioned her what ſhe had overheard; an accuſation, which revived her recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo far, that ſhe aſſured him ſhe had not come thither with an intention to liſten to his converſation, but to entreat his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion for her aunt, and for Annette. Montoni ſeemed to doubt this aſſertion, for he regarded her with a ſcrutinizing look; and the doubt evidently aroſe from no trifling intereſt. Emily then further explained herſelf, and concluded with entreating him to inform her, where her aunt was placed, and to permit, that ſhe might viſit her; but he looked upon her only with a malignant ſmile, which inſtantaneouſly confirmed her worſt fears for her aunt, and, at that moment ſhe had not courage to renew her entreaties.</p>
                     <p>"For Annette," ſaid he,—"if you go to Carlo, he will releaſe the girl; the fooliſh fellow, who ſhut her up, died yeſterday." Emily ſhuddered.—"But my aunt, Signor"—ſaid ſhe," O tell me of my aunt!"</p>
                     <p>"She is taken care of," replied Montoni haſtily, "I have no time to anſwer idle queſtions."</p>
                     <p>He would have paſſed on, but Emily, in a voice of agony, that could not be wholly reſiſted, conjured him to tell her, where Madame Montoni was; while he pauſed, and ſhe anxiouſly watched his countenance, a trumpet ſounded, and, in the next moment, ſhe heard the heavy gates of the portal open, and then the clattering of horſes' hoofs in the court, with the confuſion of many voices. She ſtood for a moment heſitating whether ſhe ſhould follow Montoni, who, at the ſound of the trumpet had paſſed through the hall, and, turning her eyes whence it came, ſhe ſaw through the door, that opened beyond a long perſpective of arches into the courts, a party of horſemen, whom ſhe judged, as well as the diſtance and her embarraſſment would allow, to be the ſame ſhe had ſeen depart, a few days before. But ſhe ſtaid not to ſcrutinize, for, when the trumpet ſounded again, the chevaliers ruſhed out of the cedar room, and men came running into the hall from every quarter of the caſtle. Emily once more hurried for ſhelter to her own apartment. Thither ſhe was ſtill purſued by images of horror. She reconſidered Montoni's man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

and words, when he had ſpoken of his wife, and they ſerved only to confirm her moſt terrible ſuſpicions. Tears refuſed any longer to relieve her diſtreſs, and ſhe had ſat for a conſidera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>"Dear young lady," ſaid he, "I have been ſo flurried, I never once thought of you till juſt now. I have brought you ſome fruit and wine, and I am ſure you muſt ſtand in need of them by this time."</p>
                     <p>"Thank you Carlo," ſaid Emily, "this is very good of you. Did the Signor remind you of me?"</p>
                     <p>"No, Signora," replied Carlo, "<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Emily then renewed her inquiries, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Madame Montoni, but Carlo had been employed at the other end of the caſtle during the time, that ſhe was removed, and he had heard nothing ſince concerning her.</p>
                     <p>While he ſpoke, Emily looked ſteadily at him, for ſhe ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knew whether he was really ignorant, or concealed his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth from a fear of offending his maſter. To ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral queſtions, concerning the contentions of yeſterday, he gave very limited anſwers: but told, that the diſputes were now ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cably ſettled, and that the Signor believed himſelf to have been miſtaken in his ſuſpicions of his gueſts. "The fighting was about that, Signors," ſaid Carlo; "but I truſt I ſhall never ſee ſuch another day in this caſtle, though ſtrange things are about to be done."</p>
                     <p>On her inquiring his meaning, "Ah, Signora!" added he, "it is not for me to betray ſecrets, or tell all I think, but time will tell."</p>
                     <p>She then deſired him to releaſe Annette, and, having deſcribed the chamber in which the poor girl was confined, he promiſed to obey her immediately, and was departing, when ſhe remembered to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Annette took the handkerchief from her face.</p>
                     <p>"You will meet Ludovico in a better world, I hope," added Emily.</p>
                     <p>"Yes—yes,—ma'amſelle," ſobbed Annette, "but I hope I ſhall meet him again in this—though he is ſo wounded!"</p>
                     <p>"Wounded!" exclaimed Emily, "does he live?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, ma'am, but—but he has a terrible wound, and could not come to let me out. They thought him dead, at firſt, and he has not been rightly himſelf, till within this hour."</p>
                     <p>"Well, Annette, I rejoice to hear he lives."</p>

                     <p>Two following days paſſed in the ſame manner, unmarked by any occurrence, during which ſhe obtained no information of Madame Montoni. On the evening of the ſecond, having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed Annette, and retired to bed, her mind became haunted by the moſt diſmal images, ſuch as her long anxiety, concerning her aunt ſuggeſted; and, unable to forget herſelf for a moment, or to vanquiſh the phantoms that tormented her, ſhe roſe from her bed, and went to one of the caſement<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The fierce and terrible paſſions, too, which ſo often agitated the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of this edifice, ſeemed now huſhed in ſleep; thoſe myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terious workings, that rouſe the elements of man's nature into tempeſt—were calm.

Her ſurpriſe, on hearing ſuch ſoothing and delicious ſounds, was, at leaſt, juſtifiable; for it was long—very long, ſince ſhe had liſtened to any thing like melody. The fierce trumpet and the ſhrill fife were the only inſtruments ſhe had heard, ſince her arrival, at Udolpho.</p>
                     <p>When her mind was ſomewhat more compoſed, ſhe tried to aſcertain from what quarter the ſounds proceeded, and thought they came from below; but whether from a room of the caſtle, or from the terrace, ſhe could not with certainty judge. Fear and ſurpriſe now yielded to the enchantment of a ſtrain, that floated on the ſilent night, with the moſt ſoft and melancholy ſweetneſs. Suddenly, it ſeemed removed to a diſtance, trembled faintly, and then entirely ceaſed.</p>
                     <p>She continued to liſten, ſunk in that pleaſing repoſe, which ſoft muſic leaves on the mind—but it came no more. Upon this ſtrange circumſtance her thoughts were long engaged, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Long ſuffering had made her ſpirits pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly ſenſible to terror, and liable to be affected by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Yet reaſon told her, that this was a wild conjecture, and ſhe was inclined to diſmiſs it; but, with the inconſiſtency ſo natural, when imagination guides the thoughts, ſhe then wavered towards a belief as wild. She remembered the ſingular event, connected with the caſtle, which had given it into the poſſeſſion of its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent owner; and, when ſhe conſidered the myſterious manner, in which its late poſſeſſor had diſappeared, and that ſhe had never ſince been heard of, her mind was impreſſed with an high degree of ſolemn awe; ſo that, though there appeared no clue to connect that event with the late muſic, ſhe was inclined fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully to think they had ſome relation to each other. At this conjecture, a ſudden chillneſs ran through her frame; ſhe looked fearfully upon the duſkineſs of her chamber, and the dead ſilence, that prevailed there, heightened to her fancy its gloomy aſpect.</p>

She ſtill muſed on the late occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and looked with anxiety to the next night, when, at the ſame hour, ſhe determined to watch whether the muſic returned.

                     <p>"Holy Saints!" rejoined Annette; "How I was ſurpriſed! I met him juſt now, on the rampart below, there. I never was ſo ſurpriſed in my life! Ah! ma'amſelle! this is a ſtrange place! I ſhould never have done wondering, if I was to live here an hundred years. But, as I was ſaying, I met him juſt now on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"This trifling is inſupportable," ſaid Emily; "prythee, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette, do not torture my patience any longer."</p>

                     <p>"I cannot gueſs," ſaid Emily impatiently.</p>
                     <p>"Nay, ma'amſelle, I'll tell you ſomething to gueſs by—A tall Signor with a longiſh face, who walks ſo ſtately, and uſed to wear ſuch a high feather in his hat; and uſed often to look down upon the ground, when people ſpoke to him; and to look at people from under his eye brows, as it were, all ſo dark and

frowning. You have ſeen him, often and often, at Venice, ma'am. Then he was ſo intimate with the Signor, too. And, now I think of it, I wonder what he could be afriad of in this lonely old caſtle, that he ſhould ſhut himſelf up for. But he is come abroad now, for I met him on the rampart juſt this minute. I trembled when I ſaw him, for I always was afraid of him, ſome how; but I determined I would not let him ſee it; ſo I went up to him, and made him a low curteſy, 'You are welcome to the caſtle, Signor Orſino,' ſaid I."</p>
                     <p>"O, it was Signor Orſino, then!" ſaid Emily.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, ma'amſelle, Signor Orſino, himſelf, who cauſed that Venetian gentleman to be killed, and has been popping about from place to place, ever ſince, as I hear."</p>
                     <p>"Good God!" exclaimed Emily, recovering from the ſhock of this intelligence; "and is <hi>

                     <p>"Yes, ma'amſelle, but if that was all, this deſolate place would conceal him, without his ſhutting himſelf up in one room. Who would think of coming to look for him here? I am ſure I ſhould as ſoon think of going to look for any body in the other world.</p>
                     <p>"There is ſome truth in that," ſaid Emily, who would now have concluded it was Orſino's muſic, which ſhe had heard, on the preceding night, had ſhe not known, that he had neither taſte, or ſkill in the art. But, though ſhe was unwilling to add to the number of Annette's ſurpriſes, by mentioning the ſubject of her own, ſhe inquired, whether any perſon in the caſtle played on a muſical inſtrument?</p>
                     <p>"O yes, ma'amſelle there is Benedetto plays the great drum to admiration; and then, there is Launcelot the trumpeter; nay, for that matter, Ludovico himſelf can play on the trumpet;—but he is ill now. I remember once"—</p>
                     <p>Emily interrupted her; "Have you heard no other muſic ſince you came to the caſtle—none laſt night?"</p>
                     <p>"Why, did <hi>you</hi> hear any laſt night, ma'amſelle?"</p>
                     <p>Emily evaded this queſtion, by repeating her own.</p>
                     <p>"Why, no, ma'am," replied Annette; "I never heard any muſic here, I muſt ſay, but the drums and the trumpet; and, as for laſt night, I did nothing but dream I ſaw my late lady's ghoſt."</p>
                     <p>"Your <hi>late</hi> lady's," ſaid Emily in a tremulous voice; "you have heard more, then. Tell me—tell me all, Annette, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat; tell me the worſt at once."</p>
                     <p>"Nay, ma'amſelle, you know the worſt already."</p>

"I know nothing," ſaid Emily.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, you do, ma'amſelle; you know, that nobody knows any thing about her; and it is plain, therefore, ſhe is gone, the way of the firſt lady of the caſtle—nobody ever knew any thing about her."</p>
                     <p>Emily leaned her head upon her hand, and was, for ſometime, ſilent; then, telling Annette ſhe wiſhed to be alone, the latter left the room.</p>
                     <p>The remark of Annette had revived Emily's terrible ſuſpicion concerning the fate of Madame Montoni; and ſhe reſolved to make another effort to obtain certainty on this ſubject, by apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Montoni once more.</p>
                     <p>When Annette returned a few hours after, ſhe told Emily, that the porter of the caſtle wiſhed very much to ſpeak with her, for that he had ſomething of importance to ſay; her ſpirits had, however, of late been ſo ſubject to alarm, that any new circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance excited it; and this meſſage from the porter, when her firſt ſurpriſe was over, made her look round for ſome lurking danger, the more ſuſpiciouſly, perhaps, becauſe ſhe had frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked the unpleaſant air and countenance of this man. She now heſitated, whether to ſpeak with him, doubting even, that this requeſt was only a pretext to draw her into ſome danger; but a little reflection ſhewed her the improbability of this, and ſhe bluſhed at her weak fears.</p>
                     <p>"I will ſpeak to him, Annette," ſaid ſhe; "deſire him to come to the corridor immediately."</p>
                     <p>Annette departed, and ſoon after returned.</p>
                     <p>"Barnardine, ma'amſelle," ſaid ſhe, "dare not come to the corridor, leſt he ſhould be diſcovered, it is ſo far from his poſt; and he dare not even leave the gates for a moment now; but, if you will come to him at the portal, through ſome roundabout paſſages he told me of, without croſſing the courts, he has that to tell, which will ſurpriſe you. But you muſt not come through the courts, leſt the Signor ſhould ſee you."</p>
                     <p>Emily, neither approving theſe "roundabout paſſages," no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> the other part of the requeſt, now poſitively refuſed to go. "Tell him." ſaid ſhe, "if he has any thing of conſequence to impart, I will hear him in the corridor, whenever he has an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of coming thither."</p>
                     <p>Annette went to deliver this meſſage, and was abſent a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time. When ſhe returned, "It won't do, ma'amſelle," ſaid ſhe. "Barnardine has been conſidering all this time what can be done, for it is as much as his place is worth to leave his

poſt now. But, if you will come to the eaſt rampart in the duſk of the evening, he can, perhaps, ſteal away, and tell you all he has to ſay."</p>
                     <p>Emily was ſurpriſed and alarmed, at the ſecrecy which this man ſeemed to think ſo neceſſary, and heſitated whether to meet him, till, conſidering, that he might mean to warn her of ſome ſerious danger, ſhe reſolved to go.</p>
                     <p>"Soon after ſunſet," ſaid ſhe, "I will be at the end of the eaſt rampart. But then the watch will be ſet," ſhe added re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting herſelf, "and how can Barnardine paſs unobſerved?"</p>
                     <p>"That is juſt what I ſaid to him, ma'am, and he anſwered me, that he had the key of the gate, at the end of the rampart, that leads towards the courts, and could let himſelf through that way; and as for the ſentinels, there were none at this end of the terrace, becauſe the place is guarded enough by the high walls of the caſtle, and the eaſt turret; and he ſaid thoſe at the other end were too far off to ſee him, if it was pretty duſkyiſh."</p>
                     <p>"Well," ſaid Emily, "I muſt hear what he has to tell; and, therefore, deſire you will go with me to the terrace, this evening."</p>
                     <p>"He deſired it might be pretty duſkyiſh, ma'amſelle," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Annette, "becauſe of the watch."</p>
                     <p>Emily pauſed, and then ſaid ſhe would be on the terrace, an hour after ſunſet; "and tell Barnardine," ſhe added, "to be punctual to the time; for that I, alſo, may be obſerved by Signor Montoni. Where is the Signor? I would ſpeak with him."</p>
                     <p>"He is in the cedar chamber, ma'am, counſelling with the other Signors. He is going to give them a ſort of a treat to-day, to make up for what paſſed at the laſt, I ſuppoſe; the people are all very buſy in the kitchen."</p>
                     <p>Emily now inquired, if Montoni expected any new gueſts? and Annette believed that he did not. "Poor Ludovico!" added ſhe, "he would be as merry as the beſt of them, if he was well; but he may recover yet. Count Morano was wounded as bad, as he, and he has got well again, and is gone back to Venice."</p>
                     <p>"Is he ſo?" ſaid Emily, "when did you hear this?"</p>
                     <p>"I heard it, laſt night, ma'amſelle, but I forgot to tell it."</p>
                     <p>Emily aſked ſome further queſtions, and then, deſiring Annette would obſerve and inform her, when Montoni was alone, the girl went to deliver her meſſage to Barnardine.</p>
                     <p>Montoni was, however, ſo much engaged, during the whole day, that Emily had no opportunity of ſeeking a releaſe from her terrible ſuſpenſe, concerning her aunt. Annette was employed in watching his ſteps, and in attending upon Ludovico, whom

ſhe, aſſiſted by Caterina, nurſed with the utmoſt care; and Emily was, of courſe, left much alone. Her thoughts dwelt often on the meſſage of the porter, and were employed in conjecturing the ſubject, that occaſioned it, which ſhe ſometimes imagined concerned the fate of Madame Montoni; at others, that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to ſome perſonal danger, which threatened herſelf. The cautious ſecrecy which Barnardine obſerved in his conduct, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined her to believe the latter.</p>
                     <p>As the hour of appointment drew near, her impatience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed. At length, the ſun ſet; ſhe heard the paſſing ſteps of the ſentinels going to their poſts; and waited only for Annette to accompany her to the terrace, who, ſoon after, came, and they deſcended together. When Emily expreſſed apprehenſions of meeting Montoni, or ſome of his gueſts, "O, there is no fear of that, ma'amſelle," ſaid Annette, "they are all ſet in to feaſting yet, and that Barnardine knows."</p>
                     <p>They reached the firſt terrace, where the ſentinels demanded who paſſed; and Emily, having anſwered, walked on to the eaſt rampart, at the entrance of which they were again ſtopped; and, having again replied, were permitted to proceed. But Emily did not like to expoſe herſelf to the diſcretion of theſe men, at ſuch an hour; and, impatient to withdraw from the ſituation, ſhe ſtepped haſtily on in ſearch of Barnardine. He was not yet come. She leaned penſively on the wall of the rampart, and waited for him. The gloom of twilight ſat deep on the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding objects, blending in ſoft confuſion the valley, the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and the woods, whoſe tall heads, ſtirred by the evening breeze, gave the only ſounds, that ſtole on ſilence, except a faint, faint chorus of diſtant voices, that aroſe from within the caſtle.</p>
                     <p>"What voices are thoſe?" ſaid Emily, as ſhe fearfully liſtened.</p>
                     <p>"It is only the Signor and his gueſts carouſing," replied An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette.</p>
                     <p>"Good God!" thought Emily, "can this man's heart be ſo gay, when he has made another being ſo wretched; if, indeed, my aunt is yet ſuffered to feel her wretchedneſs? O! whatever are my own ſufferings, may my heart never, never be hardened againſt thoſe of others!"</p>
                     <p>She looked up, with a ſenſation of horror, to the eaſt turret, near which ſhe then ſtood! <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="119" facs="unknown:029378_0173_0FE08311DB7D9900"/>
that apartment, which had appeared to contain only ſoldiers' ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coutrements. Emily, however, determined to attempt the outer door of the turret, as ſoon as Barnardine ſhould withdraw; and, if it was unfaſtened, to make another effort to diſcover her aunt.</p>
                     <p>The moments paſſed, but ſtill Barnardine did not appear; and Emily, becoming uneaſy, heſitated whether to wait any longer. She would have ſent Annette to the portal to haſten him, but feared to be left alone, for it was now almoſt dark, and a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly ſtreak of red, that ſtill lingered in the weſt, was the only veſtige of departed day. The ſtrong intereſt, however, which Barnardine's meſſage had awakened, overcame other apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and ſtill detained her.</p>
                     <p>While ſhe was conjecturing with Annette what could thus oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion his abſence, they heard a key turn in the lock of the gate near them, and preſently ſaw a man advancing. It was Barnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine, of whom Emily haſtily inquired what he had to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and deſired, that he would tell her quickly, "for I am chill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this evening air," ſaid ſhe.</p>
                     <p>"You muſt diſmiſs your maid, lady," ſaid the man in a voice, the deep tone of which ſhocked her, "what I have to tell is to you only."</p>
                     <p>Emily, after ſome heſitation, deſired Annette to withdraw to a little diſtance. "Now, my friend, what would you ſay?"</p>
                     <p>He was ſilent a moment, as if conſidering, and then ſaid,—</p>
                     <p>"That which would coſt me my place, at leaſt, if it came to the Signor's ears. You muſt promiſe, lady, that nothing ſhall ever make you tell a ſyllable of the matter; I have been truſted in this affair, and, if it was known, that I betrayed my truſt, my life, perhaps, might anſwer it. But I was concerned for you, lady, and I reſolved to tell you." He pauſed.—</p>
                     <p>Emily thanked him, aſſured him that he might repoſe on her diſcretion, and entreated him to diſpatch.</p>
                     <p>"Annette told us in the hall how unhappy you was about Signora Montoni, and how much you wiſhed to know what was become of her."</p>
                     <p>"Moſt true," ſaid Emily eagerly, "and you can inform me. I conjure you tell me the worſt, without heſitation." She reſted her trembling arm upon the wall.</p>
                     <p>"I can tell you," ſaid Barnardine, and pauſed.—</p>
                     <p>Emily had no power to enforce her entreaties.</p>
                     <p>"I <hi>can</hi> tell you," reſumed Barnardine,—"but"—</p>
                     <p>"But what?" exclaimed Emily, recovering her reſolution.</p>
                     <p>"Here I am, ma'amſelle," ſaid Annette, who, having heard
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:029378_0174_0FE08316A2C0A310"/>
the eager tone, in which Emily pronounced theſe words, came running towards her.</p>
                     <p>"Retire!" ſaid Barnardine, ſternly, "you are not wanted;" and, as Emily ſaid nothing, Annette obeyed.</p>
                     <p>"I <hi>can</hi> tell you," repeated the porter.—" but I know not how, you was afflicted before."—</p>
                     <p>"I am prepared for the worſt, my friend," ſaid Emily, in a firm and ſolemn voice. "I can ſupport any certainty better than this ſuſpenſe."</p>
                     <p>"Well, Signora, if that is the caſe, you ſhall hear.—You know, I ſuppoſe, that the Signor and his lady uſed ſometimes to diſagree. It is none of my concerns to inquire what it was about, but I believe you know it was ſo."</p>
                     <p>"Well," ſaid Emily, "proceed."</p>
                     <p>"The Signor, it ſeems, had lately been very wrath againſt her. I ſaw all, and heard all,—a great deal more than people thought for; but it was none of my buſineſs, ſo I ſaid nothing. A few days ago, the Signor ſent for me. 'Barnardine,' ſays he, 'you are—an honeſt man, I think I can truſt you.'—I aſſured his <hi>Excellenza</hi> that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e, as near as I can remember, 'I have an affair in hand, which I want you to aſſiſt me in.'—Then he told me what I was to do but that I ſhall ſay nothing about—it concerned only the Signora."</p>
                     <p>"O heavens!" exclaimed Emily—"what have you done?"</p>
                     <p>Barnardine heſitated, and was ſilent.</p>
                     <p>"What fiend could tempt him, or you, to ſuch an act!" cried Emily, chilled with horror, and ſcarcely able to ſupport her fainting ſpirits.</p>
                     <p>"It was a fiend," ſaid Barnardine in a gloomy tone of voice. They were now both ſilent;—Emily had not courage to inquire further, and Barnardine ſeemed to ſhrink from telling more. At length he ſaid, "It is of no uſe to think of the paſt; the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor was cruel enough, but he would be obeyed. What ſignified my refuſing? He would have found others, who had no ſcruples."</p>
                     <p>"You have murdered her, then!" ſaid Emily, in a hallow and inward voice—"I am talking with a murderer!" Barnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine ſtood ſilent; while Emily turned from him, and attempted to leave the place.</p>
                     <p>"Stay, lady!" ſaid he "you deſerve to think ſo ſtill—ſince you can believe me capable of ſuch a deed."</p>
                     <p>"If you are innocent, tell me quickly," ſaid Emily, in faint accents, "for I feel I ſhall not be able to hear you long."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="121" facs="unknown:029378_0174_0FE08316A2C0A310"/>
"I will tell you no more," ſaid he, and walked away. Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had juſt ſtrength enough to bid him ſtay, and then to call Annette, on whoſe arm ſhe leaned, and they walked ſlowly up the rampart, till they heard ſteps behind them. It was Barnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine again.</p>
                     <p>"Send away the girl," ſaid he, "and I will tell you more."</p>
                     <p>"She muſt not go" ſaid Emily; "what you have to ſay ſhe may hear."</p>
                     <p>"May ſhe ſo, lady?" ſaid he. "You ſhall know no more, then;" and he was going, though ſlowly, when Emily's anxiety, overcoming the reſentment and fear, which the man's behaviour had rouſed, ſhe deſired him to ſtay, and bade Annette retire.</p>
                     <p>"The Signora is alive," ſaid he, "for me. She is my pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, though; his <hi>Excellenza</hi> has ſhut her up in the chamber over the great gates of the court, and I have the charge of her. I was going to have told you, you might ſee her—but now—"</p>
                     <p>Emily, relieved from an unutterable load of anguiſh by this ſpeech, had now only to aſk Barnardine's forgiveneſs, and to conjure, that he would let her viſit her aunt.</p>
                     <p>He complied with leſs reluctance, than ſhe expected, and told her, that, if ſhe would repair, on the following night, when the Signor was retired to reſt, to the poſtern gate of the caſtle, ſhe ſhould, perhaps, ſee Madame Montoni.</p>
                     <p>Amid all the thankfulneſs, which Emily felt for this conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſhe thought ſhe obſerved a malicious triumph in his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, when he pronounced the laſt words; but, in the next mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhe diſmiſſed the thought, and, having again thanked him, commended her aunt to his pity, and aſſured him, that ſhe would herſelf reward him, and would be punctual to her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment; ſhe bade him good night, and retired, unobſerved, to her chamber. It was a conſiderable time, before the tumult of joy, which Barnardine's unexpected intelligence had occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, allowed Emily to think with clearneſs, or to be conſcious of the real dangers, that ſtill ſurrounded Madame Montoni and herſelf. When this agitation ſubſided, ſhe perceived, that her aunt was yet the priſoner of a man, to whoſe vengeance, or av<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arice, ſhe might fall a ſacrifice; and, when ſhe further conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſavage aſpect of the perſon who was appointed to guard Madame Montoni, her doom appeared to be already ſealed, for the countenance of Barnardine ſeemed to bear the ſtamp of a murderer; and, when ſhe had looked upon it, ſhe felt inclined to believe, that there was no deed, however black, which he
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:029378_0175_0FE08322DE911E78"/>
might not be prevailed upon to execute. Theſe reflections brought to her remembrance the tone of voice, in which he had promiſed to grant her requeſt to ſee his priſoner; and ſhe muſed upon it long in uneaſineſs and doubt. Sometimes, ſhe even heſitated, whether to truſt herſelf with him at the lonely hour he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; and once, and only once, it ſtruck her, that Madame Montoni might be already murdered, and that this ruffian was appointed to decoy herſelf to ſome ſecret place, where her life alſo was to be ſacrificed to the avarice of Montoni, who then would claim ſecurely the conteſted eſtates in Languedoc. The conſideration of the enormity of ſuch guilt did, at length, relieve her from the belief of its probability, but not from all the doubts and fears, which a recollection of Barnardine's manner had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned. From theſe ſubjects, her thoughts, at length, paſſed to others; and, as the evening advanced, ſhe remembered, with ſomewhat more than ſurpriſe, the muſic ſhe had heard, on the preceding night, and now awaited its return, with more than curioſity.</p>
                     <p>She diſtinguiſhed, till a late hour, the diſtant carouſals of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni and his companions—the loud conteſt, the diſſolute laugh and the choral ſong, that made the halls re-echo. At length, ſhe heard the heavy gates of the caſtle ſhut for the night, and thoſe ſounds inſtantly ſunk into a ſilence, which was diſturbed only by the whiſpering ſteps of perſons, paſſing through the galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to their remote rooms. Emily now judging it to be about the time, when ſhe had heard the muſic, on the preceding night, diſmiſſed Annette, and gently opened the caſement to watch for its return. The planet ſhe had ſo particularly noticed, at the recurrence of the muſic, was not yet riſen; but, with ſuperſtitious, weakneſs, ſhe kept her eyes fixed on that part of the hemiſphere, where it would riſe, almoſt expecting, that, when it appeared, the ſounds would return. At length, it came, ſerenely bright, over the eaſtern towers of the caſtle. Her heart trembled, when ſhe perceived it, and ſhe had ſcarcely courage to remain at the caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, leſt the returning muſic ſhould confirm her terror, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the little ſtrength ſhe yet retained. The clock ſoon after ſtruck one, and, knowing this to be about the time, when the ſounds had occurred, ſhe ſat down in a chair, near the caſement, and endeavoured to compoſe her ſpirits; but the anxiety of expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation yet diſturbed them. Every thing, however, remained ſtill; ſhe heard only the ſolitary ſtep of a ſentinel, and the lulling mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur of the woods below, and ſhe again leaned from the caſement, and again looked, as if for intelligence, to the planet, which was now riſen high above the towers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="123" facs="unknown:029378_0175_0FE08322DE911E78"/>
Emily continued to liſten, but no muſic came. "Thoſe were ſurely no mortal ſounds!" ſaid ſhe, recollecting their entrancing melody. "No inhabitant of this caſtle could utter ſuch; and, where is the feeling, that could modulate ſuch exquiſite expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion?

Father Pierre and father Antonie declared, that they had ſometimes heard them in the ſtillneſs of the night, when they alone were walking to offer their oriſons to heaven. Nay, my dear father himſelf, once ſaid, that, ſoon after my mother's death, as he lay watchful in grief, ſounds of uncommon ſweetneſs called him from his bed; and, on open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his window, he heard lofty muſic paſs along the midnight air.

                     <p>EMILY was ſomewhat ſurpriſed, on the following day, to find that Annette had heard of Madame Montoni's confinement in the chamber over the portal, as well as of her purpoſed viſit there, on the approaching night. That the circumſtance, which Barnardine had ſo ſolemnly enjoined her to conceal, he had him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf told to ſo indiſcreet an hearer as Annette, appeared very improbable, though he had now charged her with a meſſage, concerning the intended interview. He requeſted, that Emily
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:029378_0176_0FE08328A0350690"/>
would meet him, unattended, on the terrace, at a little after mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, when he himſelf would lead her to the place he had prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſed; a propoſal from which ſhe immediately ſhrunk, for a thouſand vague fears darted athwart her mind, ſuch as had tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented her on the preceding night, and which ſhe neither knew how to truſt, or to diſmiſs. It frequently occurred to her, that Barnardine might have deceived her, concerning Madame Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni, whoſe murderer, perhaps, he really was; and that he had deceived her by order of Montoni, the more eaſily to draw her into ſome of the deſperate deſigns of the latter. The terrible ſuſpicion that Madame Montoni no longer lived, thus came, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by one not leſs dreadful for herſelf. Unleſs the crime by which the aunt had ſuffered, was inſtigated merely by reſentment, unconnected with profit, a motive, upon which Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni did not appear very likely to act, its object muſt be unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, till the niece was alſo dead, to whom Montoni knew that his wife's eſtates muſt deſcend. Emily remembered the words, which had informed her, that the conteſted eſtates in France would devolve to her, if Madame Montoni died, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning them to her huſband, and the former obſtinate perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of her aunt made it too probable, that ſhe had, to the laſt, withheld them. At this inſtant, recollecting Barnardine's man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, on the preceding night, ſhe now believed, what ſhe had then fancied, that it expreſſed malignant triumph. She ſhuddered at the recollection, which confirmed her fears, and determined not to meet him on the terrace. Soon after, ſhe was inclined to conſider theſe ſuſpicions as the extravagant exaggerations of a timid and haraſſed mind, and could not believe Montoni liable to ſuch prepoſterous depravity as that of deſtroying, from one motive, his wife and her niece. She blamed herſelf for ſuffering her romantic imagination to carry her ſo far beyond the bounds of probability, and determined to endeavour to check its rapid flights, leſt they ſhould ſometimes extend into madneſs. Still, however, ſhe ſhrunk from the thought of meeting Barnardine, on the terrace, at midnight; and ſtill the wiſh to be relieved from this terrible ſuſpenſe, concerning her aunt, to ſee her, and to ſooth her ſufferings, made her heſitate what to do.</p>
                     <p>"Yet how is it poſſible, Annette, I can paſs to the terrace at that hour?" ſaid ſhe, recollecting herſelf, "the ſentinels will ſtop me, and Signor Montoni will hear of the affair."</p>
                     <p>"O ma'amſelle! that is well thought of," replied Annette.—"That is what Barnardine told me about. He gave me this key, and bade me ſay it unlocks the door at the end of the vault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:029378_0176_0FE08328A0350690"/>
gallery, that opens near the end of the eaſt rampart, ſo that you need not paſs any of the men on watch. He bade me ſay, too, that his reaſon for requeſting you to come to the terrace was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could take you to the place you want to go to, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out opening the great doors of the hall, which grate ſo heavily."</p>
                     <p>Emily's ſpirits were ſomewhat calmed by this explanation, which ſeemed to be honeſtly given to Annette. "But why did he deſire I would come alone, Annette?" ſaid ſhe.</p>
                     <p>"Why that was what I aſked him myſelf, ma'amſelle. Says I, Why is my young lady to come alone?—Surely I may come with her!—What harm can <hi>I</hi> do? But he ſaid 'No—no—I tell you not,' in his gruff way. Nay, ſays I, I have been truſted in as great affairs as this, I warrant, and it's a hard matter if I can't keep a ſecret now. Still he would ſay nothing but—'No—no—no,' Well, ſays I, if you will only truſt me, I will tell you a great ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, that was told me a month ago, and I have never opened my lips about it yet—ſo you need not be afraid of telling me. But all would not do. Then, ma'amſelle, I went ſo far as to offer him a beautiful new ſequin that Ludovico gave me for a keep ſake, and I would not have parted with it for all St. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co's Place; but even that would not do! Now what can be the reaſon of this? But I know, you know, ma'am, who you are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſee."</p>
                     <p>"Pray did Barnardine tell you this?"</p>
                     <p>"He! No ma'amſelle, that he did not."</p>
                     <p>Emily inquired who did, but Annette ſhewed, that ſhe <hi>could</hi> keep a ſecret.</p>
                     <p>During the remainder of the day, Emily's mind was agitated with doubts and fears and contrary determinations, on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of meeting this Barnardine on the rampart, and ſubmitting herſelf to his guidance, ſhe ſcarcely knew whither. Pity for her aunt and anxiety for herſelf alternately ſwayed her determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and night came, before ſhe had decided upon her conduct. She heard the caſtle clock ſtrike eleven—twelve—and yet her mind wavered. The time, however, was now come, when ſhe could heſitate no longer: and then the intereſt ſhe felt for her aunt overcame other conſiderations, and, bidding Annette fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her to the outer door of the vaulted gallery, and there await her return, ſhe deſcended from her chamber. The caſtle was perfectly ſtill, and the great hall, where ſo lately ſhe had witneſſed a ſcene of dreadful contention, now returned only the whiſpering footſteps of the two ſolitary figures gliding fearfully between the pillars, and gleamed only to the feeble lamp they
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:029378_0177_0FE08335CB876A80"/>
carried. Emily, deceived by the long ſhadows of the pillars and by the catching lights between, often ſtopped, imagining ſhe ſaw ſome perſon, moving in the diſtant obſcurity of the perſpective; and, as ſhe paſſed theſe pillars, ſhe feared to turn her eyes toward them almoſt expecting to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> a figure ſtart out from behind their broad ſhaft. She reached, however, the vaulted gallery, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruption, but uncloſed its outer door with a trembling hand, and, charging Annette not to quit it and to keep it a little open, that ſhe might be heard if ſhe called, ſhe delivered to her the lamp, which ſhe did not dare to take herſelf becauſe of the men on watch, and, alone ſtepped out upon the dark terrace. Every thing was ſo ſtill, that ſhe feared, leſt her own light ſteps ſhould be heard by the diſtant ſentinels, and ſhe walked cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly towards the ſpot where ſhe had before met Barnardine, liſtening for a ſound, and looking onward through the gloom in ſearch of him. At length, ſhe was ſtartled by a deep voice, that ſpoke near her, and ſhe pauſed, uncertain whether it was his, till it ſpoke again, and ſhe then recognized the hollow tones of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardine, who had been punctual to the moment, and was at the appointed place, reſting on the rampart wall. After chiding her for not coming ſooner, and ſaying, that he had been waiting nearly half an hour, he deſired Emily, who made no reply, to follow him to the door, through which he had entered the terrace.</p>
                     <p>While he unlocked it, ſhe looked back to that ſhe had left, and, obſerving the rays of the lamp ſtream through a ſmall open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was certain, that Annette was ſtill there. But her remote ſituation could little befriend Emily, after ſhe had quitted the terrace; and, when Barnardine uncloſed the gate, the diſmal aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the paſſage beyond, ſhewn by a torch burning on the pavement, made her ſhrink from following him alone, and ſhe refuſed to go, unleſs Annette might accompany her. This, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, Barnardine abſolutely refuſed to permit, mingling at the ſame time with his refuſal ſuch artful circumſtances to heighten the pity and curioſity of Emily towards her aunt, that ſhe, at length, conſented to follow him alone to the portal.</p>
                     <p>He then took up the torch, and led her along the paſſage, at the extremity of which he unlocked another door, whence they deſcended, a few ſteps, into a chapel, which, as Barnardine held up the torch to light her, Emily obſerved to be in ruins, and ſhe immediately recollected a former converſation of Annette, concerning it, with very unpleaſant emotions. She looked fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully on the almoſt roofleſs walls, green with damps, and on the
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:029378_0177_0FE08335CB876A80"/>
gothic points of the windows, where the ivy and the briony had long ſupplied the place of glaſs, and ran mantling among the broken capitals of ſome columns, that had once ſupported the roof. Barnardine ſtumbled over the broken pavement, and his voice, as he uttered a ſudden oath, was returned in hallow echoes, that made it more terrific. Emily's heart ſunk; but ſhe ſtill followed him, and he turned out of what had been the principal aiſle of the chapel. "Down theſe ſteps, lady, "ſaid Barnardine, as he deſcended a flight, which appeared to lead into the vaults; but Emily pauſed on the top, and demanded, in a tremulous tone, whither he was conducting her.</p>
                     <p>"To the portal," ſaid Barnardine.</p>
                     <p>"Cannot we go through the chapel to the portal?" ſaid Emily.</p>
                     <p>"No, Signora, that leads to the inner court, which I don't chooſe to unlock. This way, and we ſhall reach the outer court preſently."</p>
                     <p>Emily ſtill heſitated; fearing not only to go on, but, ſince ſhe had gone thus far, to irritate Barnardine by refuſing to go further.</p>
                     <p>"Come, lady," ſaid the man, who had nearly reached the bottom of the flight, "make a little haſte; I cannot wait here all night."</p>
                     <p>"Whither do theſe ſteps lead?" ſaid Emily, yet pauſing.</p>
                     <p>"To the portal," repeated Barnardine, in an angry tone, "I will wait no longer." As he ſaid this, he moved on with the light, and Emily, fearing to provoke him by further delay, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctantly followed. From the ſteps, they proceeded through a paſſage, adjoining the vaults, the walls of which were dropping with unwholeſome dews, and the vapours, that crept along the ground, made the torch burn ſo dimly, that Emily expected every moment to ſee it extinguiſhed, and Barnardine could ſcarcely find his way. As they advanced, theſe vapours thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, and Barnardine, believing the torch was expiring, ſtopped for a moment to trim it. As he then reſted againſt a pair of iron gates, that opened from the paſſage, Emily ſaw, by uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain flaſhes of light, the vaults beyond, and near her, heaps of earth, that ſeemed to ſurround an open grave. Such an object, in ſuch a ſcene, would, at any time, have diſturbed her; but now ſhe was ſhocked by an inſtantaneous preſentiment, that this was the grave of her unfortunate aunt, and that the treacherous Barnardine was leading herſelf to deſtruction. The obſcure and terrible place, to which he had conducted her, ſeemed to juſtify the thought; it was a place ſuited for murder, a receptacle for
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:029378_0178_0FE0833A5C27AC10"/>
the dead, where a deed of horror might be committed, and no veſtige appear to proclaim it. Emily was ſo overwhelmed with terror, that, for a moment, ſhe was unable to determine what conduct to purſue. She then conſidered, that it would be vain to attempt an eſcape from Barnardine, by flight, ſince the length and the intricacy of the way ſhe had paſſed would ſoon enable him to overtake her, who was unacquainted with the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and whoſe feebleneſs would not ſuffer her to run long with ſwiftneſs. She feared equally to irritate him by a diſcloſure of her ſuſpicions, which a refuſal to accompany him further cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly would do; and, ſince ſhe was already as much in his power as it was poſſible ſhe could be, if ſhe proceeded, ſhe, at length, determined to ſuppreſs, as far as ſhe could, the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of apprehenſion, and to follow ſilently whither he deſigned to lead her. Pale with horror and anxiety, ſhe now waited till Barnardine had trimmed the torch, and, as her ſight glanced again upon the grave, ſhe could not forbear inquiring, for whom it was prepared. He took his eyes from the torch, and fixed them upon her face without ſpeaking. She faintly repeated the queſtion, but the man, ſhaking the torch, paſſed on; and ſhe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, trembling to a ſecond flight of ſteps, having aſcended which, a door delivered them into the firſt court of the caſtle. As they croſſed it, the light ſhewed the high black walls around them, fringed with long graſs and dank weeds, that found a ſcanty ſoil among the mouldering ſtones; the heavy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> with, here and there, between them, a narrow gate, that admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a freer circulation of air to the court, the maſſy iron gates, that led to the caſtle, whoſe cluſtering turrets appeared above, and, oppoſite, the huge towers and arch of the portal itſelf. In this ſcene the large, uncouth perſon of Barnardine, bearing the torch, formed a characteriſtic figure. This Barnardine was wrapt in a long dark cloak, which ſcarcely allowed the kind of half-boots, or ſandals, that were laced upon his legs to appear, and ſhewed only the point of a broad ſword, which he uſually wore ſlung in a belt acroſs his ſhoulders. On his head was a heavy flat velvet cap, ſomewhat reſembling a turban, in which was a ſhort feather; the viſage beneath it ſhewed ſtrong features, and a countenance furrowed with the lines of cunning and darkened by habitual diſcontent.</p>
                     <p>The view of the court. however, reanimated Emily, who, as ſhe croſſed ſilently towards the portal, began to hope, that her own fears and not the treachery of Barnardine, had deceived her. She looked anxiouſly up at the firſt caſement, that appeared above
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:029378_0178_0FE0833A5C27AC10"/>
the lofty arch of the portcullis; but it was dark, and ſhe inquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether it belonged to the chamber, where Madame Montoni was confined. Emily ſpoke low, and Barnardine, perhaps, did not hear her queſtion, for he returned no anſwer; and they, ſoon after, entered the poſtern door of the gateway, which brought them to the foot of a narrow ſtaircaſe, that wound up one of the towers.</p>
                     <p>"Up this ſtaircaſe the Signora lies," ſaid Barnardine.</p>
                     <p>"Lies!" repeated Emily faintly, as ſhe began to aſcend.</p>
                     <p>"She lies in the upper chamber," ſaid Barnardine.</p>
                     <p>As they paſſed up, the wind, which poured through the narrow cavities in the wall, made the torch flare, and it threw a ſtronger gleam upon the grim and ſallow countenance of Barnardine, and diſcovered more fully the deſolation of the place—the rough ſtone walls, the ſpiral ſtairs, black with age, and a ſuit of ancient armour, with an iron viſor, that hung upon the walls, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a trophy of ſome former victory.</p>
                     <p>Having reached a landing place, "You may wait here, lady," ſaid he, applying a key to the door of a chamber, "while I go up, and tell the Signora you are coming."</p>
                     <p>"That ceremony is unneceſſary," replied Emily, "my aunt will rejoice to ſee me."</p>
                     <p>"I am not ſo ſure of that," ſaid Barnardine, pointing to the room he had opened: "Come in here, lady, while I ſtep up."</p>
                     <p>Emily, ſurpriſed and ſomewhat ſhocked, did not dare to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him further, but, as he was turning away with the torch, deſired he would not leave her in darkneſs. He looked around, and obſerving a tripod lamp, that ſtood on the ſtairs, lighted and gave it to Emily, who ſtepped forward into a large old chamber, and he cloſed the door. As ſhe liſtened anxiouſly to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting ſteps, ſhe thought he deſcended, inſtead of aſcending, the ſtairs; but the guſts of wind that whiſtled round the portal, would not allow her to hear diſtinctly any other ſound. Still, however, ſhe liſtened, and, perceiving no ſtep in the room above, where he had affirmed Madame Montoni to be, her anxiety in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, though ſhe conſidered, that the thickneſs of the floor in this ſtrong building might prevent any ſound reaching her from the upper chamber. The next moment, in a pauſe of the wind, ſhe diſtinguiſhed Barnardine's ſtep deſcending to the court, and then thought ſhe heard his voice; but, the riſing guſt again overcoming other ſounds, Emily, to be certain on this point, moved ſoftly to the door, which, on attempting to open it, ſhe diſcovered was faſtened. All the horrid apprehenſions, that had
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:029378_0179_0FE0834717EAECC0"/>
lately aſſailed her, returned at this inſtant with redoubled force, and no longer appeared like the exaggerations of a timid ſpirit, but ſeemed to have been ſent to warn her of her fate. She now did not doubt, that Madame Montoni had been murdered, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in this very chamber; or that ſhe herſelf was brought hither for the ſame purpoſe. The countenance, the manners and the recollected words of Barnardine, when he had ſpoken of her aunt, confirmed her worſt fears. For ſome moments, ſhe was incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of conſidering of any means, by which ſhe might attempt an eſcape. Still ſhe liſtened, but heard footſteps neither on the ſtairs, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> in the room above; ſhe thought, however, that ſhe again diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed Barnardine's voice below, and went to a grated win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, that opened upon the court, to inquire further. Here, ſhe plainly heard his hoarſe accents, mingling with the blaſt that ſwept by, but they were loſt again ſo quickly, that their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing could not be interpreted; and then the light of a torch, which ſeemed to iſſue from the portal below, flaſhed acroſs the court, and the long ſhadow of a man, who was under the archway, appeared upon the pavement. Emily, from the hugeneſs of this ſudden portrait, concluded it to be that of Barnardine; but other deep tones, which paſſed in the wind, ſoon convinced her that he was not alone, and that his companion was not a perſon very lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to pity.</p>
                     <p>When her ſpirits had overcome the firſt ſhock of her ſituation, ſhe held up the lamp to examine, if the chamber afforded a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of an eſcape. It was a ſpacious room, whoſe walls, wain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcoted with rough oak, ſhewed no caſement but the grated one, which Emily had left, and no other door than that, by which ſhe had entered. The feeble rays of the lamp, however, did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her to ſee at once its full extent; ſhe perceived no furniture, except, indeed, an iron chair, faſtened in the centre of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, immediately over which, depending on a chain from the ciel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hung an iron ring. Having gazed upon theſe, for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, with wonder and horror, ſhe next obſerved iron bars below, made for the purpoſe of confining the feet, and on the arms of the chair were rings of the ſame metal. As ſhe continued to ſurvey them, ſhe concluded, that they were inſtruments of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and it ſtruck her, that ſome poor wretch had once been faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened in this chair, and had there been ſtarved to death. She was chilled by the thought; but, what was her agony, when, in the next moment, it occurred to her, that her aunt might have been one of theſe victims, and that ſhe herſelf might be the next! An acute pain ſeized her head, ſhe was ſcarcely able to hold the
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:029378_0179_0FE0834717EAECC0"/>
lamp, and, looking round for ſupport, was ſeating herſelf, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſly, in the iron chair itſelf; but ſuddenly perceiving where ſhe was, ſhe ſtarted from it in horror, and ſprung towards a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote end of the room. Here again ſhe looked round for a ſeat to ſuſtain her, and perceived only a dark curtain, which, deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the cieling to the floor, was drawn along the whole ſide of the chamber. Ill as ſhe was, the appearance of this curtain ſtruck her, and ſhe pauſed to gaze upon it, in wonder and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion.</p>
                     <p>It ſeemed to conceal a receſs of the chamber; ſhe wiſhed, yet dreaded, to lift it, and to diſcover what it veiled, twice ſhe was withheld by a recollection of the terrible ſpectacle her daring hand had formerly unveiled in an apartment of the caſtle, till, ſuddenly conjecturing, that it concealed the body of her murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed aunt, ſhe ſeized it, in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>it of deſperation, and drew it aſide. Beyond, appeared a corpſe, ſtretched on a kind of low couch, which was crimſoned with human blood, as was the floor beneath.</p>
                     <p>The features deformed by death, were ghaſtly and horrible, and more than one livid wound appeared in the face. Emily, bending over the body, gazed, for a moment, with an eager, fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zied eye; but, in the next, the lamp dropped from her hand, and ſhe fell ſenſeleſs at the foot of the couch.</p>
                     <p>When her ſenſes returned, ſhe found herſelf ſurrounded by men, among whom was Barnardine, who were lifting her from the floor, and then bore her along the chamber. She was ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of what paſſed, but the extreme languor of her ſpirits did not permit her to ſpeak, or move, or even to feel any diſtinct fear. They carried her down the ſtaircaſe, by which ſhe had aſcended; when, having reached the archway, they ſtopped, and one of the men, taking the torch from Barnardine, opened a ſmall door, that was cut in the great gate, and, as he ſtepped out upon the road, the light he bore ſhewed ſeveral men on horſeback, in wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Whether it was the freſhneſs of the air, that revived Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or that the objects ſhe now ſaw rouſed the ſpirit of alarm, ſhe ſuddenly ſpoke, and made an ineffectual effort to diſengage her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the graſp of the ruffians, who held her.</p>
                     <p>Barnardine, meanwhile, called loudly for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> torch, while diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant voices anſwered, and ſeveral perſons approached, and, in the ſame inſtant, a light flaſhed upon the court of the caſtle. Again he vociferated for the torch, and the men burried Emily through the gate. At a ſhort diſtance, under the ſhelter of the caſtle walls, ſhe perceived the fellow, who had taken the light from the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, holding it to a man, buſily employed in altering the ſaddle
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:029378_0180_0FE0834BEF94E498"/>
of a horſe, round which were ſeveral horſemen, looking on, whoſe harſh features received the full glare of the torch; while the broken ground beneath them, the oppoſite walls, with the tufted ſhrubs, that overhung their ſummits, and an embattled watch tower above, were reddened with the gleam, which, fading grad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually away, left the remoter ramparts, and the woods below to the obſcurity of night.</p>
                     <p>"What do you waſte time for, there?" ſaid Barnardine with an oath, as he approached the horſemen. "Diſpatch—diſpatch."</p>
                     <p>"The ſaddle will be ready in a minute," replied the man who was buckling it, at whom Barnardine now ſwore again, for his negligence, and Emily calling feebly for help, was hurried towards the horſes, while the ruffians diſputed on which to place her, the one deſigned for her not being ready. At this moment a cluſter of lights iſſued from the great gates, and ſhe immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately heard the ſhrill voice of Annette above thoſe of ſeveral other perſons, who advanced. In the ſame moment, ſhe diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed Montoni and Cavigni, followed by a number of ruffian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> faced fellows, to whom ſhe no longer looked with terror, but with hope, for, at this inſtant, ſhe did not tremble at the thought of any dangers, that might await her within the caſtle—whence ſo lately, and ſo anxiouſly ſhe had wiſhed to eſcape. Thoſe, which threatened her from without, had engroſſed all her apprehenſions.</p>
                     <p>A ſhort conteſt enſued between the parties, in which that of Montoni, however, were preſently victors, and the horſemen, perceiving, that numbers were againſt them, and being, perhaps, not very warmly intereſted in the affair they had undertaken, galloped off, while Barnardine had run far enough to be loſt in the darkneſs, and Emily was led back into the caſtle. As ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed the courts, the remembrance of what ſhe had ſeen in the portal chamber came, with all its horror, to her mind; and when, ſoon after, ſhe heard the gate cloſe, that ſhut her once more within the caſtle walls, ſhe ſhuddered for herſelf, and, almoſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting the danger ſhe had eſcaped, could ſcarcely think, that any thing leſs precious than liberty and peace was to be found beyond them.</p>
                     <p>Montoni ordered Emily to await him in the cedar parlour, whither he ſoon followed, and then ſternly queſtioned her on this myſterious affair. Though ſhe now viewed him with horror, as the murderer of her aunt, and ſcarcely knew what ſhe ſaid in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to his impatient inquiries, her anſwers and her manner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced him, that ſhe had not taken a voluntary part in the late
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:029378_0180_0FE0834BEF94E498"/>
ſcheme, and he diſmiſſed her upon the appearance of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants whom he had ordered to attend that he might inquire fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the affair, and diſcover thoſe, who had been accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in it.</p>
                     <p>Emily had been ſometime in her apartment, before the tumult of her mind allowed her to remember ſeveral of the paſſed cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. Then, again, the dead form, which the curtain in the portal chamber had diſcloſed, came to her fancy, and ſhe ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered a groan, which terrified Annette the more, as Emily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore to ſatisfy her curioſity, on the ſubject of it, for ſhe feared to truſt her with ſo fatal a ſecret, leſt her indiſcretion ſhould call down the immediate vengeance of Montoni on herſelf.</p>
                     <p>Thus compelled to bear within her own mind the whole hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the ſecret, that oppreſſed it, her reaſon ſeemed to totter under the intolerable weight. She often fixed a wild and vacant look on Annette, and, when ſhe ſpoke, either did not hear her, or anſwered from the purpoſe. Long fits of abſtraction ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Annette ſpoke repeatedly, but her voice ſeemed not to make any impreſſion on the ſenſe of the long agitated Emily, who ſat fixed and ſilent, except that, now and then, ſhe heaved a heavy ſigh, but without tears.</p>
                     <p>Terrified at her condition, Annette, at length left the room, to inform Montoni of it, who had juſt diſmiſſed his ſervants with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having made any diſcoveries on the ſubject of his inquiry. The wild deſcription, which this girl now gave of Emily, indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him to follow her immediately to the chamber.</p>
                     <p>At the ſound of his voice, Emily turned her eyes, and a gleam of recollection ſeemed to ſhoot athwart her mind, for ſhe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately roſe from her ſeat, and moved ſlowly to a remote part of the room. He ſpoke to her in accents ſomewhat ſoftened from their uſual harſhneſs, but ſhe regarded him with a kind of half curious, half terrified look, and anſwered only "yes," to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſaid. Her mind ſtill ſeemed to retain no other impreſſion than that of fear.</p>
                     <p>Of this diſorder Annette could give no explanation, and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni, having attempted, for ſometime, to perſuade Emily to talk, retired, after ordering Annette to remain with her, during the night, and to inform him, in the morning of her condition.</p>
                     <p>When he was gone, Emily again came forward, and aſked who it was, that had been there to diſturb her. Annette ſaid it was the Signor—Signor Montoni. Emily repeated the name after her, ſeveral times, as if ſhe did not recollect it, and then ſuddenly groaned, and relapſed into abſtraction.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="134" facs="unknown:029378_0181_0FE083556ECDC7F0"/>
With ſome difficulty, Annette led her to the bed, which Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily examined with an eager, frenzied eye, before ſhe lay down, and then, pointing, turned with ſhuddering emotion, to Annette, who, now more terrified, went towards the door, that ſhe might bring one of the female ſervants to paſs the night with them; but Emily, obſerving her going, called her by name, and then in the naturally ſoft and plaintive tone of her voice, begged, that ſhe, too, would not forſake her.—"For, ſince my father died," added ſhe, ſighing, "every body forſakes me."</p>
                     <p>"Your father, ma'amſelle!" ſaid Annette, "he was dead before you knew me."</p>
                     <p>"He was, indeed!" rejoined Emily, and her tears began to flow. She now wept ſilently and long, after which, becoming quite calm, ſhe at length ſunk to ſleep, Annette having had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion enough not to interrupt her tears. This, girl as affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate as ſhe was ſimple, loſt in theſe moments all her former fears of remaining in the chamber, and watched alone by Emily, during the whole night.</p>

                     <p>EMILY's mind was refreſhed by ſleep. On waking in the morning, ſhe looked with ſurpriſe on Annette who ſat ſleeping in a chair beſide the bed, and then endeavoured to recollect her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but the circumſtances of the preceding night were ſwept from her memory, which ſeemed to retain no trace of what had paſſed, and ſhe was ſtill gazing with ſurpriſe on Annette, when the latter awoke.</p>
                     <p>"O dear ma'amſelle! do you know me?" cried ſhe.</p>
                     <p>"Know you! Certainly," replied Emily, "you are Annette; but why are you ſitting by me thus?"</p>
                     <p>"O you have been very ill, ma'amſelle, very ill indeed! and I am ſure I thought—"</p>
                     <p>"This is very ſtrange!" ſaid Emily, ſtill trying to recollect the paſt.—"But I think I do remember, that my fancy has been haunted by frightful dreams. Good God!" ſhe added, ſuddenly ſtarting—"ſurely it was nothing more than a dream!"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="135" facs="unknown:029378_0181_0FE083556ECDC7F0"/>
She fixed a terrified look upon Annette, who, intending to quiet her, ſaid "Yes, ma'amſelle, it was more than a dream, but it is all over now."</p>
                     <p>"She <hi>is</hi> murdered, then!" ſaid Emily in an inward voice, and ſhuddering inſtantaneouſly. Annette ſcreamed; for, being ignorant of the circumſtance to which Emily referred, ſhe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed her manner to a diſordered fancy; but, when ſhe had explained to what her own ſpeech alluded, Emily, recollecting the attempt that had been made to carry her off, aſked if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triver of it had been diſcovered. Annette replied, that he had not, though he might eaſily be gueſſed at; and then told Emily ſhe might thank her for her deliverance, who, endeavouring to command the emotion, which the remembrance of her aunt had occaſioned, appeared calmly to liſten to Annette, though, in truth, ſhe heard ſcarcely a word that was ſaid.</p>
                     <p>"And ſo, ma'amſelle," continued the latter, "I was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to be even with Barnardine for refuſing to tell me the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, by finding it out myſelf; ſo I watched you, on the terrace, and, as ſoon as he had opened the door at the end, I ſtole out from the caſtle, to try to follow you; for, ſays I, I am ſure no good can be planned, or why all this ſecrecy? So, ſure enough, he had not bolted the door after him, and, when I opened it, I ſaw, by the glimmer of the torch, at the other end of the paſſage, which way you were going. I followed the light, at a diſtance, till you came to the vaults of the chapel, and there I was afraid to go further, for I had heard ſtrange things about theſe vaults. But then, again, I was afraid to go back, all in darkneſs, by myſelf; ſo by the time Barnardine had trimmed the light, I had reſolved to follow you, and I did ſo, till you came to the great court, and there I was afraid he would ſee me; ſo I ſtopped at the door again, and watched you acroſs to the gates, and, when you was gone up the ſtairs, I whipt after. There, as I ſtood un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the gateway, I heard horſes' feet without, and ſeveral men talking; and I heard them ſwearing at Barnardine for not bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you out, and juſt then, he had like to have caught me, for he came down the ſtairs again, and I had hardly time to get out of his way. But I had heard enough of his ſecret now, and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to be even with him, and to ſave you, too, ma'amſelle, for I gueſſed it to be ſome new ſcheme of Count Morano, though be was gone away. I ran into the caſtle, but I had hard work to find my way through the paſſage under the chapel, and what is very ſtrange, I quite forgot to look for the ghoſts they had told me about, though I would not go into that place again by

myſelf for all the world! Luckily the Signor and Signor Cavigni were up, ſo we had ſoon a train at our heels, ſufficient to frighten that Barnardine and his rogues, all together."</p>
                     <p>Annette ceaſed to ſpeak, but Emily ſtill appeared to liſten. At length ſhe ſaid, ſuddenly, "I think I will go to him myſelf; where is he?"</p>
                     <p>Annette aſked who was meant.</p>
                     <p>"Signor Montoni," replied Emily. "I would ſpeak with him;" and Annette, now remembering the order he had given, on the preceding night, reſpecting her young lady, roſe, and ſaid ſhe would ſeek him herſelf.</p>
                     <p>This honeſt girl's ſuſpicions of Count Morano were perfectly juſt; Emily, too when ſhe thought on the ſcheme, had attributed it to him; and Montoni, who had not a doubt on this ſubject, alſo, began to believe, that it was by the direction of Morano that poiſon had formerly been mingled with his wine.</p>
                     <p>The profeſſions of repentance, which Morano had made to Emily, under the anguiſh of his wound, were ſincere at the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he offered them; but he had miſtaken the ſubject of his ſorrow, for, while he thought he was condemning the cruelty of his late deſign, he was lamenting only the ſtate of ſuffering, to which it had reduced him. As theſe ſufferings abated, his former views revived, till, his health being re-eſtabliſhed, he again found himſelf ready for enterpriſe and difficulty. The porter of the caſtle, who had ſerved him on a former occaſion, willingly accepted a ſecond bribe; and, having concerted the means of drawing Emily to the gates, Morano publicly left the hamlet, whither he had been carried after the affray, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew with his people to another at ſeveral miles diſtance. From thence, on a night agreed upon by Barnardine, who had diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered from the thoughtleſs prattle of Annette, the moſt probable means of decoying Emily, the Count ſent back his ſervants to the caſtle, while he awaited her arrival at the hamlet, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of carrying her immediately to Venice. How this, his ſecond ſcheme, was fruſtrated, has already appeared; but the violent, and various paſſions with which this Italian lover was now agitated, on his return to that city, can only be imagined.</p>
                     <p>Annette having made her report to Montoni, of Emily's health and of her requeſt to ſee him, he replied, that ſhe might attend him in the cedar room, in about an hour. It was on the ſubject, that preſſed ſo heavily on her mind, that Emily wiſhed to ſpeak to him, yet ſhe did not diſtinctly know what good purpoſe this could anſwer and ſometimes ſhe even recoiled in horror from
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:029378_0182_0FE0835B06FD4A98"/>
the expectation of his preſence. She wiſhed, alſo, to petition, though ſhe ſcarcely dared to believe the requeſt would be granted, that he would permit her, ſince her aunt was no more, to return to her native country.</p>
                     <p>As the moment of interview approached, her agitation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed ſo much, that ſhe almoſt reſolved to excuſe herſelf under what could ſcarcely be called a pretence of illneſs and, when ſhe conſidered what could be ſaid, either concerning herſelf, or the fate of her aunt, ſhe was equally hopeleſs as to the event of her entreaty, and terrified as to its effect upon the vengeful ſpirit of Montoni. Yet, to pretend ignorance of her death, appeared in ſome degree, to be ſharing its criminality, and, indeed, this event was the only ground, on which Emily could reſt her pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition for leaving Udolpho.</p>
                     <p>While her thoughts thus wavered, a meſſage was brought, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting, that Montoni could not ſee her, till the next day; and her ſpirits were then relieved, for a moment, from an almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable weight of apprehenſion. Annette ſaid, ſhe fancied the Chevaliers were going out to the wars again, for the court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard was filled with horſes, and ſhe heard, that the reſt of the party, who went out before, were expected at the caſtle. "And I heard one of the ſoldiers, too," added ſhe, "ſay to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade, that he would warrant they'd bring home a rare deal of booty.—So, thinks I, if the Signor can, with a ſafe conſcience, ſend his people out a robbing—why it is no buſineſs of mine. I only wiſh I was once ſafe out of this caſtle; and, if it had not been for poor Ludovico's ſake, I would have let Count Morano's people run away with us both, for it would have been ſerving you a good turn, ma'amſelle, as well as myſelf."</p>
                     <p>Annette might have continued thus talking for hours for any interruption ſhe would have received from Emily, who was ſilent, inattentive, abſorbed in thought, and paſſed the whole of this day in a kind of ſolemn tranquillity, ſuch as is often the reſult of fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulties overſtrained by ſuffering.</p>
                     <p>When night returned, Emily recollected the myſterious ſtrains of muſic, that ſhe had lately heard in which ſhe ſtill felt ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of intereſt, and of which ſhe hoped to hear again the ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſweetneſs. The influence of ſuperſtition now gained on the weakneſs of her long haraſſed mind; ſhe looked, with enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtic expectation, to the guardian ſpirit of her father, and, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſmiſſed Annette for the night, determined to watch alone for their return. It was not yet, however, near the time when ſhe had heard the muſic on a former night, and anxious to call off
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:029378_0183_0FE083672683E0E8"/>
her thoughts from diſtreſſing ſubjects, ſhe ſat down with one of the few books, that ſhe had brought from France; but her mind, refuſing control, became reſtleſs and agitated, and ſhe went of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the caſement to liſten for a ſound. Once, ſhe thought ſhe heard a voice, but then, every thing without the caſement remaining ſtill, ſhe concluded, that her fancy had deceived her.</p>
                     <p>Thus paſſed the time, till twelve o'clock, ſoon after which the diſtant ſounds that murmured through the caſtle, ceaſed, and ſleep ſeemed to reign over all. Emily then ſeated herſelf at the caſement, where ſhe was ſoon recalled from the reverie, into which ſhe ſunk, by very unuſual ſounds, not of muſic, but like the low mourning of ſome perſon in diſtreſs. As ſhe liſtened, her heart faltered in terror, and ſhe became convinced, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ound was more than imaginary. Still, at intervals, ſhe heard a kind of feeble lamentation, and ſought to diſcover whence it came. There were ſeveral rooms underneath, adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rampart, which had been long ſhut up, and, as the ſound probably roſe from one of theſe, ſhe leaned from the caſement to obſerve, whether any light was viſible there. The chambers, as far as ſhe could perceive, were quite dark, but, at a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, on the rampart below, ſhe thot' ſhe ſaw ſomething moving.</p>
                     <p>The faint twilight, which the ſtars ſhed, did not enable her to diſtinguiſh what it was; but ſhe judged it to be a ſentinel, on watch, and ſhe removed her light to a remote part of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that ſhe might eſcape notice, during her further obſervation.</p>
                     <p>The ſame object ſtill appeared. Preſently, it advanced along the rampart, towards her window, and ſhe then diſtinguiſhed ſomething like a human form, but the ſilence, with which it mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, convinced her it was no ſentinel. As it drew near, ſhe heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated whether to retire; a thrilling curioſity inclined her to ſtay, but a dread of ſhe ſcarcely knew what warned her to withdraw.</p>
                     <p>While ſhe pauſed, the figure came oppoſite to her caſement, and was ſtationary. Every thing remained quiet; ſhe had not heard even a footfall; and the ſolemnity of this ſilence, with the myſterious form ſhe ſaw, ſubdued her ſpirits, ſo that ſhe was mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving from the caſement, when on a ſudden, ſhe obſerved the figure ſtart away, and glide down the rampart, after which it was ſoon loſt in the obſcurity of night. Emily continued to gaze, for ſometime, on the way it had paſſed, and then retired within her chamber, muſing on this ſtrange circumſtance, and ſcarcely doubting that ſhe had witneſſed a ſupernatural appearance.</p>
                     <p>When her ſpirits recovered compoſure, ſhe looked round for ſome other explanation. Remembering what ſhe had heard of the daring enterpriſes of Montoni, it occurred to her, that ſhe
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:029378_0183_0FE083672683E0E8"/>
had juſt ſeen ſome unhappy perſon, who, having been plundered by his banditti, was brought hither a captive; and that the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic ſhe had formerly heard, came from him. Yet, if they had plundered him, it ſtill appeared improbable, that they ſhould have brought him to the caſtle, and it was alſo more conſiſtent with the manners of banditti to murder thoſe they rob, than to make them priſoners. But what, more than any other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, contradicted the ſuppoſition, that it was a priſoner, was that it wandered on the terrace, without a guard: a conſideration, which made her diſmiſs immediately her firſt ſurmiſe.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards, ſhe was inclined to believe, that Count Morano had obtained admittance into the caſtle; but ſhe ſoon recollected the difficulties and dangers, that muſt have oppoſed ſuch an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, and that, if he had ſo far ſucceeded, to come alone and in ſilence to her caſement at midnight was not the conduct he would have adopted, particularly ſince the private ſtaircaſe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating with her apartment, was known to him; neither would he have uttered the diſmal ſounds ſhe had heard.</p>
                     <p>Another ſuggeſtion repreſented, that this might be ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who had deſigns upon the caſtle; but the mournful ſounds deſtroyed, alſo that probability. Thus, inquiry only perplexed her. Who, or what, it could be that haunted this lonely hour, complaining in ſuch doleful accents and in ſuch ſweet muſic (for ſhe was ſtill inclined to believe, that the former ſtrains and the late appearance were connected) ſhe had no means of aſcertaining; and imagination again aſſumed her empire, and rouſed the myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries of ſuperſtition.</p>
                     <p>She determined, however, to watch on the following night, when her doubts might, perhaps, be cleared up; and ſhe almoſt reſolved to addreſs the figure, if it ſhould appear again.</p>

                     <p>ON the following day, Montoni ſent a ſecond excuſe to Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily, who was ſurpriſed at the circumſtance. "This is very ſtrange!" ſaid ſhe to herſelf. "His conſcience tells him the purport of my viſit, and he defers it, to avoid an explanation." She now almoſt reſolved to throw herſelf in his way, but terror
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:029378_0184_0FE0836BC4C2D388"/>
checked the intention, and this day paſſed, as the preceding one, with Emily, except that a degree of awful expectation, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the approaching night, now ſomewhat diſturbed the dreadful calmneſs that had pervaded her mind.</p>
                     <p>Towards evening, the ſecond part of the band, which had made the firſt excurſion among the mountains, returned to the caſtle, where, as they entered the courts, Emily, in her remote chamber, heard their loud ſhouts and ſtrains of exultation, like the orgies of furies over ſome horrid ſacrifice. She even feared they were about to commit ſome barbarous deed; a conjecture from which, however, Annette ſoon relieved her, by telling, that the people were only exulting over the plunder they had brought with them. This circumſtance ſtill further confirmed her in the belief, that Montoni had really commenced to be a captain of banditti, and meant to retrieve his broken fortunes by the plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of travellers! Indeed, when ſhe conſidered all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his ſituation—in an armed, and almoſt inacceſſible caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, retired far among the receſſes of wild and ſolitary mountains, along whoſe diſtant ſkirts were ſcattered towns, and cities, whither wealthy travellers were continually paſſing—this appeared to be the ſituation of all others moſt ſuited for the ſucceſs of ſchemes of rapine, and ſhe yielded to the ſtrange thought, that Montoni was become a captain of robbers. His character alſo, unprinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, dauntleſs, cruel and enterpriſing, ſeemed to fit him for the ſituation. Delighting in the tumult and in the ſtruggles of life, he was equally a ſtranger to pity and to fear; his very courage was a ſort of animal ferocity; not the noble impulſe of a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, ſuch as inſpirits the mind againſt the oppreſſor, in the cauſe of the oppreſſed; but a conſtitutional hardineſs of nerve, that cannot feel, and that, therefore, cannot fear.</p>
                     <p>Emily's ſuppoſition, however natural, was in part erroneous, for ſhe was a ſtranger to the ſtate of this country and to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, under which its frequent wars were partly conducted. The revenues of the many ſtates of Italy being, at that time, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient to the ſupport of ſtanding armies, even during the ſhort periods, which the turbulent habits both of the governments and the people permitted to paſs in peace, an order of men aroſe not known in our age, and but faintly deſcribed in the hiſtory of their own. Of the ſoldiers, diſbanded at the end of every war, few returned to the ſafe, but unprofitable occupations, then uſual in peace. Sometimes they paſſed into other countries, and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with armies, which ſtill kept the field. Sometimes they formed themſelves into bands of robbers, and occupied remote
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:029378_0184_0FE0836BC4C2D388"/>
fortreſſes, where their deſperate character, the weakneſs of the governments which they offended, and the certainty that they could be recalled to the armies, when their preſence ſhould be again wanted, prevented them from being much purſued by the civil power; and, ſometimes, they attached themſelves to the fortunes of a popular chief, by whom they were led into the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of any ſtate, which could ſettle with him the price of their valour. From this latter practice aroſe their name—<hi>Condottieri;</hi> a term formidable all over Italy, for a period, which concluded in the earlier part of the ſeventeenth century, but of which it is not ſo eaſy to aſcertain the commencement.</p>
                     <p>Conteſts between the ſmaller ſtates were then, for the moſt part, affairs of enterpriſe alone, and the probabilities of ſucceſs were eſtimated, not from the ſkill, but from the perſonal courage of the general, and the ſoldiers. The ability, which was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the conduct of tedious operations, was little valued. It was enough to know how a party might be led towards their enemies, with the greateſt ſecrecy, or conducted from them in the compacteſt order. The officer was to precipitate himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſituation, where, but for his example, the ſoldiers might not have ventured; and, as the oppoſite parties knew little of each other's ſtrength, the event of the day was frequently determined by the boldneſs of the firſt movements. In ſuch ſervices the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dottieri</hi> were eminent, and in theſe, where plunder always follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſucceſs, their characters acquired a mixture of intrepidity and profligacy, which awed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ven thoſe whom they ſerved.</p>
                     <p>When they were not thus engaged, their chief had uſually his own fortreſs, in which, or in its neighbourhood, they enjoyed an irkſome reſt; and, though their wants were, at one time, partly ſupplied from the property of the inhabitants, the laviſh diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their plunder at others, prevented them from being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious; and the peaſants of ſuch diſtricts gradually ſhared the character of their warlike viſitors. The neighbouring govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſometimes profeſſed, but ſeldom endeavoured, to ſuppreſs theſe military communities; both becauſe it was difficult to do ſo, and becauſe a diſguiſed protection of them enſured, for the ſervice of their wars, a body of men, who could not otherwiſe be ſo cheaply maintained, or ſo perfectly qualified. The comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſometimes even relied ſo far upon this policy of the ſeveral powers, as to frequent their capitals; and Montoni, having met them in the gaming parties of Venice and Padua, conceived a deſire to emulate their characters, before his ruined fortunes tempted him to adopt their practices. It was for the arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:029378_0185_0FE08379589AB4C0"/>
of his preſent plan of life, that the midnight councils were held at his manſion in Venice, and at which Orſino and ſome other members of the preſent community then aſſiſted with ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions, which they had ſince executed with the wreck of their fortunes.</p>
                     <p>On the return of night, Emily reſumed her ſtation at the caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. There was now a moon; and, as it roſe over the tufted woods, its yellow light ſerved to ſhew the lonely terrace and the ſurrounding objects, more diſtinctly, than the twilight of the ſtars had done, and promiſed Emily to aſſiſt her obſervations, ſhould the myſterious form return. On this ſubject, ſhe again wavered in conjecture, and heſitated whether to ſpeak to the figure, to which a ſtrong and almoſt irreſiſtible intereſt urged her; but terror, at intervals, made her reluctant to do ſo.</p>
                     <p>"If this is a perſon who has deſigns upon the caſtle," ſaid ſhe, "my curioſity may prove fatal to me; yet the myſterious muſic, and the lamentations I heard, muſt ſurely have proceeded from him: if ſo, he cannot be an enemy."</p>
                     <p>She then thought of her unfortunate aunt, and, ſhuddering with grief and horror, the ſuggeſtions of imagination ſeized her mind with all the force of truth, and ſhe believed, that the form ſhe had ſeen was ſupernatural. She trembled, breathed with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, an icy coldneſs touched her cheeks, and her fears for a while overcame her judgment. Her reſolution now forſook her, and the determined, if the figure ſhould appear, not to ſpeak to it.</p>
                     <p>Thus the time paſſed, as ſhe ſat at her caſement, awed by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, and by the gloom and ſtillneſs of midnight; for ſhe ſaw obſcurely in the moonlight only the mountains and woods, a cluſter of towers, that formed the weſt angle of the caſtle, and the terrace below; and heard no ſound, except now and then, the lonely watchword, paſſed by the ſentinels on duty, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſteps of the men who came to relieve guard, and whom ſhe knew at a diſtance on the rampart by their pikes, that glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the moonbeam, and then, by the few ſhort words, in which they hailed their fellows of the night. Emily retired within her chamber, while they paſſed the caſement. When ſhe returned to it, all was again quiet. It was now very late, ſhe was wearied with watching, and began to doubt the reality of what ſhe had ſeen on the preceding night; but ſhe ſtill lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered at the window, for her mind was too perturbed to admit of ſleep. The moon ſhone with a clear luſtre, that afforded her a complete view of the terrace; but ſhe ſaw only a ſolitary ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel, pacing at one end of it; and, at length, tired with expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſhe withdr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="143" facs="unknown:029378_0185_0FE08379589AB4C0"/>
Such, however, was the impreſſion, left on her mind by the muſic, and the complaining ſhe had formerly heard, as well as by the figure, which ſhe fancied ſhe had ſeen, that ſhe deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to repeat the watch, on the following night.</p>
                     <p>Montoni, on the next day, took no notice of Emily's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed viſit, but ſhe, more anxious than before to ſee him, ſent Annette to inquire, at what hour he would admit her. He mentioned eleven o'clock, and Emily was punctual to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; at which ſhe called up all her fortitude to ſupport the ſhock of his preſence and the dreadful recollections it enforced. He was with ſeveral of his officers, in the cedar room; on ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving whom ſhe pauſed; and her agitation increaſed, while he continued to converſe with them, apparently not obſerving her, till ſome of his officers, turning round, ſaw Emily, and uttered an exclamation. She was haſtily retiring, when Montoni's voice arreſted her, and, in a faltering accent, ſhe ſaid,—"I would ſpeak with you, Signor Montoni, if you are at leiſure."</p>
                     <p>"Theſe are my friends," he replied, "whatever you would ſay, they may hear."</p>
                     <p>Emily, without replying, turned from the rude gaze of the chevaliers, and Montoni then followed her to the hall, whence he led her to a ſmall room, of which he ſhut the door with violence. As ſhe looked on his dark countenance, ſhe again thought ſhe ſaw the murderer of her aunt; and her mind was ſo convulſed which horror, that ſhe had not power to recal thought enough to explain the purport of her viſit; and to truſt herſelf with the mention of Madame Montoni was more than ſhe dared.</p>
                     <p>Montoni at length impatiently inquired what ſhe had to ſay? "I have no time for trifling," he added, "my moments are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant."</p>
                     <p>Emily then told him, that ſhe wiſhed to return to France, and came to beg that he would permit her to do ſo.—But when he looked ſurpriſed, and inquired for the motive of the requeſt, ſhe heſitated, became paler than before, trembled, and had nearly ſunk at his feet. He obſerved her emotion, with apparent indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and interrupted the ſilence by telling her, he muſt be gone. Emily, however, recalled her ſpirits ſufficiently to enable her to repeat her requeſt. And, when Montoni abſolutely refuſed it, her ſlumbering mind was rouſed.</p>
                     <p>"I can no longer remain here with propriety, ſir," ſaid ſhe, "and I may be allowed to aſk, by what right you detain me."</p>
                     <p>"It is my will that you remain here," ſaid Montoni, laying his hand on the door to go; "let that ſuffice you."</p>

Emily, conſidering that ſhe had no appeal from this will, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore to diſpute his right, and made a feeble effort to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade him to be juſt. "While my aunt lived, ſir," ſaid ſhe, in a tremulous voice, "my reſidence here was not improper; but now, that ſhe is no more, I may ſurely be permitted to depart. My ſtay cannot benefit you, ſir, and will only diſtreſs me."</p>
                     <p>"Who told you, that Madame Montoni was dead?" ſaid Montoni, with an inquiſitive eye. Emily heſitated, for nobody told her ſo, and ſhe did not dare to avow the having ſeen that ſpectacle in the portal chamber, which had compelled her to the belief.</p>
                     <p>"Who told you ſo?" he repeated, more ſternly.</p>
                     <p>"Alas! I know it too well," replied Emily: "ſpare me on this terrible ſubject!"</p>
                     <p>She ſat down on a bench to ſupport herſelf.</p>
                     <p>"If you wiſh to ſee her," ſaid Montoni, "you may; ſhe lies in the eaſt turret."</p>
                     <p>He now left the room, without awaiting her reply, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the cedar chamber, where ſuch of the chevaliers as had not before ſeen Emily, began to rally him, on the diſcovery they had made; but Montoni did not appear diſpoſed to bear this mirth, and they changed the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>Having talked with the ſubtle Orſino, on the plan of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſion, which he meditated for a future day, his friend adviſed, that they ſhould lie in wait for the enemy, which Verezzi impet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly oppoſed, reproached Orſino with want of ſpirit, and ſwore, that, if Montoni would let him lead on fifty men, he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer all that ſhould oppoſe him.</p>
                     <p>Orſino ſmiled contemptuouſly; Montoni ſmiled too, but he alſo liſtened. Verezzi then proceeded with vehement declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and aſſertion, till he was ſtopped by an argument of Orſino, which he knew not how to anſwer better than by invective. His fierce ſpirit deteſted the cunning caution of Orſino, whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly oppoſed, and whoſe inveterate, though ſilent, hatred he had long ago incurred. And Montoni was a calm obſerver of both, whoſe different qualifications, he knew, and how to bend their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite character to the perfection of his own deſigns. But Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rezzi in the heat of oppoſition, now did not ſcruple to accuſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſino of cowardice, at which the countenance of the latter, while he made no reply, was overſpread with a livid paleneſs; and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni, who watched his lurking eye, ſaw him put his hand haſtily into his boſom. But Verezzi, whoſe face glowing with crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, formed a ſtriking contraſt to the complexion of Orſino, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:029378_0186_0FE0837DEF67D570"/>
not the action, and continued boldly declaiming againſt cowards to Cavigni, who was ſlily laughing at his vehemence, and at the ſilent mortification of Orſino, when the latter, retir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a few ſteps behind, drew forth a ſtilletto to ſtab his adverſary in the back. Montoni arreſted his half extended arm, and, with a ſignificant look, made him return the poinard into his boſom, unſeen by all except himſelf; for moſt of the party were diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a diſtant window, on the ſituation of a dell where they meant to form an ambuſcade.</p>
                     <p>When Verezzi had turned round, the deadly hatred expreſſed on the features of his opponent, raiſing, for the firſt time, a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of his intention, he laid his hand on his ſword, and then, ſeeming to recollect himſelf, ſtrode up to Montoni.</p>
                     <p>"Signor," ſaid he, with a ſignificant look at Orſino, "we are not a band of aſſaſſins; if you have buſineſs for brave men employ me on this expedition: you ſhall have the laſt drop of my blood; if you have only work for cowards—keep him," pointing to Orſino, "and let me quit Udolpho."</p>
                     <p>Orſino, ſtill more incenſed, again drew forth his ſtilletto, and ruſhed towards Verezzi, who, at the ſame inſtant, advanced with his ſword, when Montoni and the reſt of the party interfered and ſeparated them.</p>
                     <p>"This is the conduct of a boy," ſaid Montoni to Verezzi, "not of a man: be more moderate in your ſpeech."</p>
                     <p>"Moderation is the virtue of cowards," retorted Verezzi; "they are moderate in every thing—but in fear."</p>
                     <p>"I accept your words," ſaid Montoni, turning upon him with a fierce and haughty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ook, and drawing his ſword out of the ſcabbard.</p>
                     <p>"With all my heart," cried Verezzi, "though I did not mean them for you."</p>
                     <p>He directed a paſs at Montoni; and, while they fought, the villain Orſino, made another attempt to ſtab Verezzi, and was again prevented.</p>
                     <p>The combatants were, at length, ſeparated; and, after a very long and violent diſpute, reconciled. Montoni then left the room with Orſino, whom he detained in private conſultation for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> conſiderable time.</p>
                     <p>Emily, meanwhile, ſtunned by the laſt words of Montoni, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got, for the moment, his declaration, that ſhe ſhould continue in the caſtle, while ſhe thought of her unfortunate aunt, who, he had ſaid, was laid in the eaſt turret. In ſuffering the remains of his wife to lie thus long unburied, there appeared a degree of bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:029378_0187_0FE0838782076CA8"/>
more ſhocking than ſhe had ſuſpected even Montoni could practiſe.</p>
                     <p>After a long ſtruggle, ſhe determined to accept his permiſſion to viſit the turret, and to take a laſt look of her ill-fated aunt: with which deſign ſhe returned to her chamber, and, while ſhe waited for Annette to accompany her, endeavoured to acquire fortitude ſufficient to ſupport her through the approaching ſcene, for, though ſhe trembled to encounter it, ſhe knew that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the performance of this laſt act of duty would hereafter afford her conſoling ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>Annette came, and Emily mentioned her purpoſe, from which the former endeavoured to diſſuade her, though without effect, and Annette was, with much difficulty, prevailed upon to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company her to the turret; but no conſideration could make her promiſe to enter the chamber of death.</p>
                     <p>They now left the corridor, and, having reached the foot of the ſtaircaſe, which Emily had formerly aſcended, Annette de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared ſhe would go no further, and Emily proceeded a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>re. When ſhe ſaw the track of blood, which ſhe had before obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, her ſpirits fainted, and, being compelled to reſt on the ſtairs, ſhe almoſt determined to proceed no further. The pauſe of a few moments reſtored her reſolution, and ſhe went on.</p>
                     <p>As ſhe drew near the landing place, upon which the upper chamber opened, ſhe remembered, that the door was formerly faſtened, and apprehended, that it might ſtill be ſo. In this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, however, ſhe was miſtaken; for the door opened at once, into a duſky and ſilent chamber, round which ſhe fearfully looked, and then ſlowly advanced, when a hollow voice ſpoke. Emily, who was unable to ſpeak, or to move from the ſpot, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered no ſound of terror. The voice ſpoke again; and, then, thinking that it reſembled that of Madame Montoni, Emily's ſpirits were inſtantly rouſed; ſhe ruſhed towards a bed, that ſtood in a remote part of the room, and drew aſide the curtain. Within appeared a pale and emaciated face. She ſtarted back, then again advanced, ſhuddered as ſhe took up the ſkeleton hand, that lay ſtretched upon the quilt; then let it drop, and then viewed the face with a long, unſettled gaze. It was that of Madame Montoni, though ſo changed by illneſs, that the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of what it had been, could ſcarcely be traced in what it now appeared. She was ſtill alive, and, raiſing her heavy eyes, ſhe turned them on her niece.</p>
                     <p>"Where have you been ſo long?" ſaid ſhe, in the ſame hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low tone, "I thought you had forſaken me."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="147" facs="unknown:029378_0187_0FE0838782076CA8"/>
"Do you indeed live," ſaid Emily, at length, "or is this but a terrible apparition?" She received no anſwer, and again ſhe ſnatched up the hand. "This is ſubſtance," ſhe exclaimed, "but it is cold—cold as marble!" She let it fall. "O, if you really live, Speak!" ſaid Emily, in a voice of deſperation, "that I may not loſe my ſenſes—ſay you know me!"</p>
                     <p>"I do live," replied Madame Montoni, "but—I feel that I am about to die."</p>
                     <p>Emily claſped the hand ſhe held, more eagerly, and groaned. They were both ſilent for ſome moments. Then Emily endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſooth her, and inquired what had reduced her to this preſent deplorable ſtate.</p>
                     <p>Montoni, when he removed her to the turret under the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable ſuſpicion of having attempted his life, had ordered the men employed on the occaſion, to obſerve a ſtrict ſecrecy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning her. To this he was influenced by a double motive.—He meant to debar her from the comfort of Emily's viſits, and to ſecure an opportunity of privately diſpatching her, ſhould any new circumſtances occur to confirm the preſent ſuggeſtions of his ſuſpecting mind. His conſciouſneſs of the hatred he deſerved it was natural enough ſhould at firſt lead him to attribute to her the attempt that had been made upon his life; and, though there was no other reaſon to believe that ſhe was concerned in that attrocious deſign, his ſuſpicions remained; he continued to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine her in the turret, under a ſtrict guard; and, without pity or remorſe, had ſuffered her to lie, forlorn and neglected, under a raging fever, till it had reduced her to the preſent ſtate.</p>
                     <p>The track of blood, which Emily had ſeen on the ſtairs, had flowed from the unbound wound of one of the men employed to carry Madame Montoni, and which he had received in the late affray. At night theſe men, having contented themſelves with ſecuring the door of their priſoner's room, had retired from guard; and then it was, that Emily, at the time of her firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, had found the turret ſo ſilent and deſerted.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe had attempted to open the door of the chamber, her aunt was ſleeping, and this occaſioned the ſilence, which had contributed to delude her into a belief, that ſhe was no more; yet had her terror permitted her to perſevere longer in the call, ſhe would probably have awakened Madame Montoni, and have been ſpared much ſuffering. The ſpectacle in the portal cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which afterwards confirmed Emily's horrible ſuſpicion, was the corpſe of a man, who had fallen in the affray, and the ſame which had been borne into the ſervants' hall, where ſhe took re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:029378_0188_0FE0838D573519E0"/>
from the tumult. This man had lingered under his wounds for ſome days; and, ſoon after his death, his body had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved on the couch, on which he died, for interment in the vault beneath the chapel, through which Emily and Barnardine had paſſed to the chamber.</p>
                     <p>Emily, after aſking Madame Montoni a thouſand queſtions concerning herſelf, left her, and ſought Montoni; for the more ſolemn intereſt ſhe felt for her aunt, made her now regardleſs of the reſentment her remonſtrances might draw upon herſelf, and of the improbability of his granting what ſhe meant to entreat.</p>
                     <p>"Madame Montoni is now dying, ſir," ſaid Emily, as ſoon as ſhe ſaw him—"Your reſentment, ſurely will not purſue her to the laſt moment; Suffer her to be removed from that forlorn room to her own apartment, and to have neceſſary comforts ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered."</p>
                     <p>"Of what ſervice will that be, if ſhe is dying?" ſaid Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni with apparent indifference.</p>
                     <p>"The ſervice, at leaſt, of ſaving you, ſir, from a few of thoſe pangs of conſcience you muſt ſuffer, when you ſhall be in the ſame ſituation," ſaid Emily, with imprudent indignation, of which Montoni ſoon made her ſenſible, by commanding her to quit his preſence. Then forgetting her reſentment, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed only by compaſſion for the piteous ſtate of her aunt, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without ſuccour, ſhe ſubmitted to humble herſelf to Monto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, and to adopt every perſuaſive means, that might reduce him to relent towards his wife.</p>
                     <p>For a conſiderable time he was proof againſt all ſhe ſaid, and all ſhe looked; but at length the divinity of pity, beaming in Emily's eyes, ſeemed to touch his heart. He turned away, aſhamed of his better feelings, half ſullen and half relen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">
                           <desc>••••</desc>
                        </gap>; but finally conſented, that his wife ſhould be removed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Dreading equally; that this relief might arrive too late, and that Montoni might retract his conceſſion, Emily ſcarcely ſtaid to thank him for it, but, aſſiſted by Annette, ſhe quickly prepared Madame Montoni's bed, and they carried her a cordial, that might ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble her feeble frame to ſuſtain the fatigue of a removal.</p>
                     <p>Madame was ſcarcely arrived in her own appartment, when an order was given by her huſband that ſhe ſhould remain in the turret; but Emily, thankful that ſhe had made ſuch diſpatch, haſtened to inform him of it, as well as that a ſecond removal would inſtantly prove fatal, and he ſuffered his wife to continue where ſhe was.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="149" facs="unknown:029378_0188_0FE0838D573519E0"/>
During this day, Emily never left Madame Montoni, except to prepare ſuch little nouriſhing things as ſhe judged neceſſary to ſuſtain her, and which Madame Montoni received with quiet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcence, though ſhe ſeemed ſenſible that they could not ſave her from approaching diſſolution, and ſcarcely appeared to wiſh for life. Emily meanwhile watched over her with the moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſolicitude, no longer ſeeing her imperious aunt in the poor object before her, but the ſiſter of her late beloved father, in a ſituation that called for all her compaſſion and kindneſs. When night came, ſhe determined to ſit up with her aunt, but this the latter poſitively forbade, commanding her to retire to reſt, and Annette alone to remain in her chamber. Reſt was, indeed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Emily, whoſe ſpirits and frame were equally wearied by the occurrences and exertions of the day; but ſhe would not leave Madame Montoni, till after the turn of midnight, a period then thought ſo critical by the phyſicians. Soon after twelve, having enjoined Annette to be wakeful, and to call her, ſhould any change appear for the worſe, Emily ſorrowfully bade Madame Montoni good night, and withdrew to her chamber.—Her ſpirits were more than uſually depreſſed by the piteous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of her aunt, whoſe recovery ſhe ſcarcely dared to expect. To her own misfortunes ſhe ſaw no period, incloſed as ſhe was, in a remote caſtle, beyond the reach of any friends, had ſhe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed ſuch, and beyond the pity even of ſtrangers; while ſhe knew herſelf to be in the power of a man capable of any action, which his intereſt, or his ambition, might ſuggeſt.</p>
                     <p>Occupied by melancholy reflections and by anticipations as ſad, ſhe did not retire immediately to reſt, but leaned thoughtfully on her open caſement. The ſcene before her of woods and mountains, repoſing in the moonlight, formed a regretted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt with the ſtate of her mind; but the lonely murmur of theſe woods, and the view of this ſleeping landſcape, gradually ſoothed her emotions and ſoftened her to tears.</p>
                     <p>She continued to weep, for ſometime. loſt to every thing, but to a gentle ſenſe of her misfortunes. When ſhe, at length, took the handkerchief from her eyes, ſhe perceived, before her, on the terrace below, the figure ſhe had formerly obſerved, which ſtood fixed and ſilent, immediately oppoſite to her caſement. On perceiving it, ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>arted back, and terror for ſometime over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came curioſity; at length, ſhe returned to the caſement, and ſtill the figure was before it, which ſhe now compelled herſelf to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, but was utterly unable to ſpeak, as ſhe had formerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. The moon ſhone with a clear light, and it was, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:029378_0189_0FE0839AB4743130"/>
the agitation of her mind, that prevented her diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with any degree of accuracy, the form before her. It was ſtill ſtationary, and ſhe began to doubt, whether it was really an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imated.</p>
                     <p>Her ſcattered thoughts were now ſo far returned as to remind her, that her light expoſed her to dangerous obſervation, and ſhe was ſtepping back to remove it, when ſhe perceived the figure move, and then wave what ſeemed to be its arm, as if to beckon her; and while ſhe gazed, fixed in fear, it repeated the action. She now attempted to ſpeak, but the words died on her lips, and ſhe went from the caſement to remove her light, as ſhe was do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which, ſhe heard, from without, a faint groan. Liſtening, but not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Again ſhe liſtened, but the ſound came no more; and, after a long interval of ſilence, ſhe recovered courage enough to go to the caſement, when ſhe again ſaw the ſame appearance! It beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned again, and again uttered a low ſound.</p>
                     <p>"That groan was ſurely human!" ſaid ſhe, "I <hi>will</hi> ſpeak."</p>
                     <p>"Who is it," cried Emily in a faint voice, "that wanders at this late hour?"</p>
                     <p>The figure raiſed its head but ſuddenly ſtarted away, and glided down the terrace. She watched it for a long while, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſwiftly in the moonlight, but heard no footſtep, till a ſentinel from the other extremity of the rampart walked ſlowly along. The man ſtopped under her window, and looking up, called her by name. She was retiring precipitately, but a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſummons inducing her to reply, the ſoldier then reſpectful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſked if ſhe had ſeen any thing paſs. On her anſwering, that ſhe had; he ſaid no more, but walked away down the terrace, Emily following him with her eyes, till he was loſt in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. But, as he was on guard, ſhe knew he could not go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the rampart, and therefore reſolved to await his return.</p>
                     <p>Soon after, his voice was heard, at a diſtance, calling loudly; and then a voice ſtill more diſtant anſwered, and, in the next mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the watchword was given, and paſſed along the terrace. As the ſoldiers moved haſtily under the caſement, ſhe called to inquire what had happened, but they paſſed without regarding her.</p>
                     <p>Emily's thoughts returning to the figure ſhe had ſeen, "It cannot be a perſon, who has deſigns upon the caſtle," ſaid ſhe; "ſuch an one would conduct himſelf very differently. He would not venture were ſentinels were on watch, nor fix him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf oppoſite to a window, were he perceived he muſt be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:029378_0189_0FE0839AB4743130"/>
much leſs would he beckon, or utter a ſound of complaint. Yet it cannot be a priſoner, for how could he obtain the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to wander thus?"</p>
                     <p>If ſhe had been ſubject to vanity, ſhe might have ſuppoſed this figure to be ſome inhabitant of the caſtle, who wandered under her caſement in the hope of ſeeing her, and of being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to declare his admiration; but this opinion never occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Emily, and, if it had, ſhe would have diſmiſſed it as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, on conſidering, that, when the opportunity of ſpeaking had occurred, it had been ſuffered to paſs in ſilence; and that, even at the moment in which ſhe had ſpoken, the form had ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly quitted the place.</p>
                     <p>While ſhe muſed, two ſentinels walked up the rampart in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt converſation, of which ſhe caught a few words, and learned from theſe, that one of their comrades had fallen down ſenſeleſs. Soon after, three other ſoldiers appeared ſlowly advancing from the bottom of the terrace, but ſhe heard only a low voice, that came at intervals. As they drew near, ſhe perceived this to be the voice of him, who walked in the middle, apparently ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his comrades; and ſhe again called to them, inquiring what had happened. At the ſound of her voice, they ſtopped, and looked up, while ſhe repeated her queſtion and was told, that Roberto, their fellow of the watch, had been ſeized with a fit, and that his cry, as he fell bad cauſed a falſe alarm.</p>
                     <p>"Is he ſubject to fits?" ſaid Emily.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, Signora," replied Roberto; "but if I had not, what I ſaw was enough to have frightened the Pope himſelf."</p>
                     <p>"What was it?" inquired Emily, trembling.</p>
                     <p>"I cannot tell what it was, lady, or what I ſaw, or how it, vaniſhed," replied the ſoldier, who ſeemed to ſhudder at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection.</p>
                     <p>"Was it the perſon whom you followed down the rampart, that has occaſioned you this alarm?" ſaid Emily, endeavouring to conceal her own.</p>
                     <p>"Perſon!" exclaimed the man,—"it was the devil, and this is not the firſt time I have ſeen him!"</p>
                     <p>"Nor will it be the laſt," obſerved one of his comrades laughing.</p>
                     <p>"No, no, I warrant not," ſaid another.</p>
                     <p>"Well," rejoined Roberto, "you may be as merry now, as you pleaſe; you was none ſo jocoſe the other night, Sebaſtian, when you was on watch with Launcelot."</p>
                     <p>"Launcelot need not talk of that," replied Sebaſtian, "let him remember how he ſtood trembling, and unable to give the

                        <hi>word,</hi> till the man was gone. If the man had not come ſo ſilent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon us, I would have ſeized him, and ſoon made him tell who he was."</p>
                     <p>"What man?" inquired Emily.</p>
                     <p>"It was no man, lady," ſaid Launcelot, who ſtood by, "but the devil himſelf as my comrade ſays. What man, who does not live in the caſtle, could get within the walls at midnight? Why, I might juſt as well pretend to march to Venice and get among all the Senators, when they are counſelling; and I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant I ſhould have more chance of getting out again alive, than any fellow, that we ſhould catch within the gates after dark. So I think I have proved plainly enough, that this can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body that lives out of the caſtle; and now I will prove, that it can be nobody that lives in the caſtle—for, if he did—why ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e be afraid to be ſeen? So after this, I hope nobody will pretend to tell me it was any body. No, I ſay again, by holy Pope! it was the devil, and Sebaſtian, there, knows this is not the firſt time we have ſeen him."</p>
                     <p>"When did you ſee the figure, then, before?" ſaid Emily half ſmiling, who, though ſhe thought the converſation ſomewhat too much, felt an intereſt, which would not permit her to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it.</p>
                     <p>"About" week ago, lady," ſaid Sebaſtian, taking up the ſtory.</p>
                     <p>"And where?"</p>
                     <p>"On the rampart, lady, higher up."</p>
                     <p>"Did you purſue it, that it fled?"</p>
                     <p>"No, Signora. Launcelot and I were on watch together, and every thing was ſo ſtill, you might have heard a mouſe ſtir, when, ſuddenly, Launcelot ſays—Sebaſtian! do you ſee nothing? I turned my head a little to the left, as it might be—thus.—No, ſays I. Huſh! ſaid Launcelot,—look yonder—juſt by the laſt cannon on the rampart! I looked, and then thought I did ſee ſomething move; but there being no light, but what the ſtars gave, I could not be certain. We ſtood quite ſilent, to watch it, and preſently ſaw ſomething paſs along the caſtle wall juſt oppoſite to us!"</p>
                     <p>"Why did not you ſeize it, then?" cried a ſoldier, who had ſcarcely ſpoken till now.</p>
                     <p>"Aye, why did you not ſeize it?" ſaid Roberto.</p>
                     <p>"You ſhould have been there to have done that," replied Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian. "You would have been bold enough to have taken it by the throat, though it had been the devil himſelf; we could not take ſuch a liberty, perhaps becauſe we are not ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:029378_0190_0FE0839F508B6D88"/>
with him, as you are. But, as I was ſaying, it ſtole by us ſo quickly, that we had not time to get rid of our ſurpriſe, before it was gone. Then, we knew it was in vain to follow.—We kept conſtant watch all that night, but we ſaw it no more. Next morning, we told ſome of our comrades, who were on du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on other parts of the ramparts, what we had ſeen; but they had ſeen nothing, and laughed at us, and it was not till to night, that the ſame figure walked again."</p>
                     <p>"Where did you loſe it, friend?" ſaid Emily to Roberto.</p>
                     <p>"When I left you, lady," replied the man, "you might ſee me go down the rampart, but it was not till I reached the eaſt terrace, that I ſaw any thing. Then, the moon ſhining bright, I ſaw ſomething like a ſhadow flitting before me, as it were, at ſome diſtance. I ſtopped, when I turned the corner of the eaſt tower, where I had ſeen this figure not a moment before,—but it was gone! As I ſtood, looking through the old arch, which leads to the eaſt rampart, and where I am ſure it had paſſed, I heard, all of a ſudden, ſuch a ſound!—It was not like a groan, or a cry, or a ſhout, or any thing I ever heard in my life. I heard it only once, and that was enough for me; for I know nothing that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened after, till I found my comrades, here, about me."</p>
                     <p>"Come," ſaid Sebaſtian, "let us go to our poſts—the moon is ſetting. Good night, lady!"</p>
                     <p>"Aye, let us go," rejoined Roberto. "Good night, lady."</p>
                     <p>"Good night; the holy mother guard you!" ſaid Emily, as ſhe cloſed her caſement and retired to reflect upon the ſtrange circumſtance that had juſt occurred, connecting which with what had happened on former nights, ſhe endeavoured to derive from the whole ſomething more poſitive than conjecture. But her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agination was inflamed, wile her judgment was not enlightened, and the terrors of ſuperſtition again pervaded her mind.</p>

                     <p>IN the morning, Emily found Madame Montoni nearly in the ſame condition, as on the preceding night; ſhe had ſlept little, and that little had not refreſhed her; ſhe ſmiled on her niece, and ſeemed cheered by her preſence, but ſpoke only a few words,
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:029378_0191_0FE083A9B1159510"/>
and never named Montoni, who, however, ſoon after, entered the room. His wife, when ſhe underſtood that he was there, appeared much agitated, but was entirely ſilent, till Emily roſe from a chair at the bed ſide, when ſhe begged in a feeble voice, that ſhe would not leave her.</p>
                     <p>The viſit of Montoni was not to ſooth his wife, whom he knew to be dying, or to conſole, or to aſk her forgiveneſs, but to make a laſt effort to procure that ſignature, which would transfer her eſtates in Languedoc, after her death, to him, rather than to Emily. This was a ſcene, that exhibited on his part, his uſual inhumanity, and, on that of Madame Montoni, a perſevering ſpirit, contending with a feeble frame; while Emily repeatedly declared to him her willingneſs to reſign all claim to thoſe eſtates, rather than that the laſt hours of her aunt ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed by contention. Montoni, however, did not leave the room, till his wife, exhauſted by the obſtinate diſpute, had faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſhe lay ſo long inſenſible, that Emily began to fear that the ſpark of life was extinguiſhed. At length, ſhe revived, and, looking feebly up at her niece, whoſe tears were falling over her, made an effort to ſpeak, but her words were unintelligible, and Emily again apprehended ſhe was dying. Afterwards, however, ſhe recovered her ſpeech, and, being ſomewhat reſtored by a cordial, converſed for a conſiderable time, on the ſubject of her eſtates in France, with clearneſs and preciſion. She directed her niece where to find ſome papers relative to them, which ſhe had hitherto concealed from the ſearch of Montoni, and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charged her never to ſuffer theſe papers to eſcape her.</p>
                     <p>Soon after this converſation, Madame Montoni ſunk into a doſe, and continued ſlumbering, till evening, when ſhe ſeemed better than ſhe had been ſince her removal from the <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>turret.—Emily never left her, for a moment, till long after midnight, and even then would not have quitted the room, had not her aunt entreated, that ſhe would retire to reſt. She then obeyed, the more willingly, becauſe her patient appeared ſomewhat recruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſleep; and, giving Annette the ſame injunction, as on the preceding night, ſhe withdrew to her own apartment. But her ſpirits were wakeful and agitated, and, finding it impoſſible to ſleep, ſhe determined to watch, once more, for the myſterious appearance that had ſo much intereſted and alarmed her.</p>
                     <p>It was now the ſecond watch of the night, and about the time when the figure had before appeared. Emily heard the paſſing ſteps of the ſentinels, on the rampart, as they changed guard; and, when all was again ſilent, ſhe took her ſtation at the caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:029378_0191_0FE083A9B1159510"/>
leaving her lamp in a remote part of the chamber, that ſhe might eſcape notice from without. The moon gave a faint and uncertain light, for heavy vapours ſurrounded it, and, often rolling over the diſk, left the ſcene below in total dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It was in one of theſe moments of obſcurity, that ſhe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved a ſmall and lambent flame, moving at ſome diſtance on the terrace. While ſhe gazed, it diſappeared, and the moon again emerging from the lurid and heavy thunder clouds, ſhe turned her attention to the heavens, where the vivid lightnings darted from cloud to cloud, and flaſhed ſilently on the woods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. She loved to catch in the momentary gleam, the gloomy landſcape. Sometimes, a cloud opened its light upon a diſtant mountain, and while the ſudden ſplendour illumined all its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of rock and wood, the reſt of the ſcene remained in deep ſhadow; at others, partial features of the caſtle were revealed by the glimpſe—the ancient arch leading to the eaſt rampart, the turret above, or the fortifications beyond; and then, perhaps, the whole edifice with all its towers its dark maſſy walls and pointed caſements would appear and vaniſh in an inſtant.</p>
                     <p>Emily, looking again upon the rampart, perceived the flame ſhe had ſeen before; it moved onward; and, ſoon after, ſhe thought ſhe heard a footſtep. The light appeared and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared frequently, while, as ſhe watched, it glided under her caſements, and, at the ſame inſtant, ſhe was certain, that a foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtep paſſed, but the darkneſs did not permit her to diſtinguiſh any object except the flame. It moved away, and then, by a gleam of lightning, ſhe perceived ſome perſon on the terrace.—All the anxieties of the preceding night returned. This perſon advanced, and the playing flame alternately appeared and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed. Emily wiſhed to ſpeak, to end her doubts, whether this figure were human or ſupernatural; but her courage failed as often as ſhe attempted utterance, till the light moved again un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the caſement, and ſhe faintly demanded who paſſed.</p>
                     <p>"A friend," replied a voice.</p>
                     <p>"What friend?" ſaid Emily, ſomewhat encouraged, "who are you, and what is that light you carry?"</p>
                     <p>"I am Anthonio, one of the Signor's ſoldiers," replied the voice.</p>
                     <p>"And what is that tapering light you bear?" ſaid Emily, "See how it darts upwards,—and now it vaniſhes!"</p>
                     <p>"This light, lady," ſaid the ſoldier, "has appeared to night as you ſee it, on the point of my lance, ever ſince I have been on watch; but what it means I cannot tell."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="156" facs="unknown:029378_0192_0FE083AFAD90EEA8"/>
"This is very ſtrange!" ſaid Emily.</p>
                     <p>"My fellow guard," continued the man, "has the ſame flame on his arms; he ſays he has ſometimes ſeen it before. I never did; I am but lately come to the caſtle, for I have not been long a ſoldier."</p>
                     <p>"How does your comrade account for it?" ſaid Emily.</p>
                     <p>"He ſays it is an omen, lady, and bodes no good."</p>
                     <p>"And what harm can it bode?" rejoined Emily.</p>
                     <p>"He knows not ſo much as that, lady."</p>
                     <p>Whether Emily was alarmed by this omen, or not, ſhe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly was relieved from much terror by diſcovering this man to be only a ſoldier on duty, and it immediately occurred to her, that it might be him, who had occaſioned ſo much alarm on the preceding night. There were, however, ſome circumſtances, that ſtill required explanation. As far as ſhe could judge by the faint moonlight, that had aſſiſted her obſervation, the figure ſhe had ſeen did not reſemble this man either in ſhape or ſize; beſides, ſhe was certain it had carried no arms. The ſilence of its ſteps, if ſteps it had, the moaning ſounds, too, which it had uttered, and its ſtrange diſappearance, were circumſtances of myſterious import, that did not apply, with probability, to a ſoldier engaged in the duty of his guard.</p>
                     <p>She now inquired of the ſentinel, whether he had ſeen any perſon beſides his fellow watch, walking on the terrace, about midnight; and then briefly related what ſhe had herſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
                     <p>"I was not on guard that night, lady," replied the man, "but I heard of what happened. There are amongſt us, who believe ſtrange things. Strange ſtories, too, have long been told of this caſtle, but it is no buſineſs of mine to repeat them; and, for my part, I have no reaſon to complain; our Chief does no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly by us."</p>
                     <p>"I commend your prudence," ſaid Emily, "Good night, and accept this from me," ſhe added, throwing him a ſmall piece of coin, and then cloſing the caſement to put an end to the diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>When he was gone, ſhe opened it again, liſtened with a gloomy pleaſure to the diſtant thunder, that began to murmur among the mountains, and watched the arrowy lightnings, which broke over the remoter ſcene. The pealing thunder rolled onward, and then, reverbed by the mountains, other thunder ſeemed to anſwer from the oppoſite horizon; while the accumulating clouds entirely concealing the moon, aſſumed a red ſulphureous tinge, that foretold a violent ſtorm.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="157" facs="unknown:029378_0192_0FE083AFAD90EEA8"/>
Emily remained at her caſement, till the vivid lightning that now, every inſtant, revealed the wide horizon and the landſcape below, made it no longer ſafe to do ſo, and ſhe went to her couch; but, unable to compoſe her mind to ſleep, ſtill liſtened in ſilent awe to the tremendous ſounds that ſeemed to ſhake the caſtle to its foundation.</p>
                     <p>She had continued thus for a conſiderable time, when, amidſt the uproar of the ſtorm, ſhe thought ſhe heard a voice, and, raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herſelf to liſten, ſaw the chamber door open, and Annette enter with a countenance of wild affright.</p>
                     <p>"She is dying, ma'amſelle, my lady is dying," ſaid ſhe.</p>
                     <p>Emily ſtarted up, and ran to Madame Montoni's room. When ſhe entered, her aunt appeared to have fainted, for ſhe was quite ſtill, and inſenſible; and Emily with a ſtrength of mind, that refuſed to yield to grief, while any duty required her activity, applied every means that ſeemed likely to reſtore her. But the laſt ſtruggle was over—ſhe was gone for ever.</p>
                     <p>When Emily perceived, that all her efforts were ineffectual, ſhe interrogated the terrified Annette, and learned that Madame Montoni had fallen into a doze, ſoon after Emily's departure, in which ſhe had continued, until a few minutes before her death.</p>
                     <p>"I wondered, ma'amſelle," ſaid Annette, "what was the reaſon my lady did not ſeem frightened at the thunder, when I was ſo terrified, and I went often to the bed to ſpeak to her, but ſhe appeared to be aſleep; till preſently I heard a ſtrange noiſe, and, on going to her ſaw ſhe was dying."</p>
                     <p>Emily, at this recital, ſhed tears. She had no doubt but that the violent change in the air, which the tempeſt produced, had ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected this fatal one, on the exhauſted frame of Madame Montoni.</p>
                     <p>After ſome deliberation, ſhe determined that Montoni ſhould not be informed of this event till the morning, for ſhe conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he might, perhaps, utter ſome inhuman expreſſions, ſuch as in the preſent temper of her ſpirits ſhe could not bear. With Annette alone, therefore, whom ſhe encouraged by her own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, ſhe performed ſome of the laſt ſolemn offices for the dead, and compelled herſelf to watch during the night, by the body of her deceaſed aunt. During this ſolemn period, rendered more awful by the tremendous ſtorm that ſhook the air, ſhe frequently addreſſed herſelf to Heaven for ſupport and protection, and her pious prayers we may believe, were accepted of the God, that giveth comfort.</p>

                     <p>WHEN Montoni was informed of the death of his wife, and conſidered that ſhe had died without giving him the ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo neceſſary to the accompliſhment of his wiſhes, no ſenſe of decency reſtrained the expreſſion of his reſentment. Emily anxiouſly avoided his preſence, and watched, during two days and two nights, with little intermiſſion, by the corps of her late aunt. Her mind deeply impreſſed with the unhappy fate of this object, ſhe forgot all her faults, her unjuſt and imperious conduct to herſelf; and, remembering only her ſufferings, thought of her only with tender compaſſion. Sometimes, however, ſhe could not avoid muſing upon the ſtrange infatuation that had proved ſo fatal to her aunt, and had involved herſelf in a labyrinth of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, from which ſhe ſaw no means of eſcaping,—the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with Montoni. But, when ſhe conſidered this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, it was "more in ſorrow than in anger,"—more for the purpoſe of indulging lamentation than reproach.</p>
                     <p>In her pious cares ſhe was not diſturbed by Montoni, who not only avoided the chamber, where the remains of his wife were laid, but that part of the caſtle adjoining to it, as if he had apprehended a contagion in death. He ſeemed to have given no orders reſpecting the funeral, and Emily began to fear <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e meant to offer a new inſult to the memory of Madame Montoni; but from this apprehenſion ſhe was relieved, when, on the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſecond day, Annette informed her, that the interment was to take place that night. She knew, that Montoni would not attend; and it was ſo very grievous to her to think that the remains of her unfortunate aunt would paſs to the grave with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out one relative, or friend to pay them the laſt decent rites, that ſhe determined to be deterred by no conſiderations for herſelf, from obſerving this duty. She would otherwiſe have ſhrunk from the circumſtance of following them to the cold vault, to which they were to be carried by men, whoſe air and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſeemed to ſtamp them for murderers, at the midnight hour of ſilence and privacy, which Montoni had choſen for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting, if poſſible, to oblivion the reliques of a woman, whom his harſh conduct had at leaſt contributed to deſtroy.</p>

                        <pb n="159" facs="unknown:029378_0193_0FE083BA1E9A7518"/>
Emily ſhuddering with emotions of horror and grief, aſſiſted by Annette, prepared the corpſe for interment; and, having wrapt it in cerements, and covered it with a windingſheet, they watched beſide it, till paſt midnight, when they heard the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching footſteps of the men, who were to lay it in its earthy bed. It was with difficulty, that Emily overcame her emotion, when the door of the chamber being thrown open, their gloomy countenances were ſeen by the glare of the torch they carried, and two of them, without ſpeaking, lifted the body on their ſhoulders, while the third preceding them with the light, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended through the caſtle towards the grave, which was in the lower vault of the chapel within the caſtle walls.</p>
                     <p>They had to croſs two courts, towards the eaſt wing of the caſtle, which, adjoining the chapel, was, like it, in ruins: but the ſilence and gloom of theſe courts had now little power over Emily's mind, occupied as it was, with more mournful ideas; and ſhe ſcarcely heard the low and diſmal hooting of the night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birds, that rooſted among the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But, when, having entered the chapel, and paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the mouldering pillars of the aiſles, the bearers ſtopped at a flight of ſteps, that led down to a low arched door, and, their comrade having deſcended to unlock it, ſhe ſaw imperfectly the gloomy abyſs beyond;—ſaw the corpſe of her aunt carried down theſe ſteps, and the ruffian-like figure, that ſtood with a torch at the bottom to receive it—all her fortitude was loſt in emotions of inexpreſſible grief and terror. She turned to lean upon An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette, who was cold and trembling like herſelf, and ſhe lingered ſo long on the ſummit of the flight, that the gleam of the torch began to die away on the pillars of the chapel, and the men were almoſt beyond her view. Then, the gloom around her awakening other fears, and a ſenſe of what ſhe conſidered to be her duty overcoming her reluctance, ſhe deſcended to the vaults, following, the echo of footſteps and the faint ray, that pierced the darkneſs, till the harſh grating of a diſtant door, that was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to receive the corpſe, again appalled her.</p>
                     <p>After the pauſe of a moment, ſhe went on, and, as ſhe enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the vaults, ſaw between the arches, at ſome diſtance, the men lay down the body near the edge of an open grave, where ſtood another of Montoni's men and a prieſt, whom ſhe did not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, till he began the burial ſervice; then, lifting her eyes from the ground, ſhe ſaw the venerable figure of the friar, and heard him in a low voice, equally ſolemn and affecting, perform
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:029378_0194_0FE082B458FCFCE8"/>
the ſervice for the dead. At the moment, in which they let down the body into the earth, the ſcene was ſuch as only the dark pencil of a Domenichino, perhaps, could have done juſtice to. The fierce features and wild dreſs of the <hi>condottieri,</hi> bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their torches over the grave, into which the corpſe was deſcending, were contraſted by the venerable figure of the monk, wrapt in long black garments, his cowl thrown back from his pale face, on which the light gleaming ſtrongly ſhewed the lines of affliction ſoftened by piety, and the few grey locks, which time had ſpared on his temples: while, beſide him, ſtood the ſofter form of Emily, who leaned for ſupport upon Annette; her face half averted, and ſhaded by a thin veil, that fell over her figure; and her mild and beautiful countenance fixed in grief ſo ſolemn as admitted not of tears, while ſhe thus ſaw com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted untimely to the earth her laſt relative and friend. The gleams, thrown between the arches of the vaults, where, here and there, the broken ground marked the ſpots in which other bodies had been recently interred, and the general obſcurity beyond were circumſtances, that alone would have led on the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſpectator to ſcenes more horrible, than even that, which was pictured at the grave of the miſguided and unfortunate Madame Montoni.</p>
                     <p>When the ſervice was over, the friar regarded Emily with atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſurpriſe, and looked as if he wiſhed to ſpeak to her, but was reſtrained by the preſence of the condottieri, who as they now led the way to the courts, amuſed themſelves with jokes upon his holy order, which he endured in ſilence, demanding only to be conducted ſafely to his convent, and to which Emily liſtened with concern and even horror. When they reached the court, the monk gave her his bleſſing, and, after a lingering look of pity, turned away to the portal, whither one of the men carried a torch; while Annette, lighting another, preceded Emily to her apartment. The appearance of the friar and the expreſſion of tender compaſſion, with which he had regarded her, had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted Emily, who, though it was at her earneſt ſupplication, that Montoni had conſented to allow a prieſt to perform the laſt rites for his deceaſed wife, knew nothing concerning this perſon, till Annette now informed her, that he belonged to a monaſtery, ſituated among the mountains at a few miles diſtance. The Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior, who regarded Montoni and his aſſociates, not only with averſion, but with terror, had probably feared to offend him by refuſing his requeſt, and had, therefore, ordered a monk to offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate at the funeral, who, with the meek ſpirit of a chriſtian,
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:029378_0194_0FE082B458FCFCE8"/>
had overcome his reluctance to enter the walls of ſuch a caſtle, by the wiſh of performing what he conſidered to be his duty, and, as the chapel was built on conſecrated ground, had not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to commit to it the remains of the late unhappy Madame Montoni.</p>
                     <p>Several days paſſed with Emily in total ſecluſion, and in a ſtate of mind, partaking both of terror for herſelf, and grief for the departed. She, at length, determined to make other efforts to perſuade Montoni to permit her to return to France. Why he ſhould wiſh to detain her, ſhe could ſcarcely date to conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but it was too certain that he did ſo, and the abſolute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal he had formerly given to her departure allowed her little hope, that he would now conſent to it. But the horror, which his preſence inſpired, made her defer, from day to day, the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this ſubject; and at laſt ſhe was awakened from her inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity only by a meſſage from him, deſiring her attendance at a certain hour. She began to hope he meant to reſign, now that her aunt was no more, the authority he had uſurped over her; till ſhe recollected, that the eſtates, which had occaſioned ſo much contention, were now hers, and ſhe then feared Montoni was about to employ ſome ſtratagem for obtaining them, and that he would detain her his priſoner, till he ſucceeded. This thought, inſtead of overcoming her with deſpondency, rouſed all the latent powers of her fortitude into action; and the property, which ſhe would willingly have reſigned to ſecure the peace of her aunt, ſhe reſolved, that no common ſufferings of her own ſhould ever compel her to give to Montoni. For Valancourt's ſake alſo ſhe determined to preſerve theſe eſtates, ſince they would afford that competency, by which ſhe hoped to ſecure the comfort of their future lives. As ſhe thought of this ſhe indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the tenderneſs of tears, and anticipated the delight of that moment, when, with affectionate generoſity, ſhe might tell him they were his own. She ſaw the ſmile, that lighted up his fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures—the affectionate regard, which ſpoke at once his joy and thanks; and, at this inſtant, ſhe believed ſhe could brave any ſuffering which the evil ſpirit of Montoni might be preparing for her. Remembering then, for the firſt time ſince her aunt's death, the papers relative to the eſtates in queſtion, ſhe deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to ſearch for them, as ſoon as her interview with Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni was over.</p>
                     <p>With theſe reſolutions ſhe met him at the appointed time, and waited to hear his intention before ſhe renewed her requeſt. With him were Orſino, and another officer, and both were ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:029378_0195_0FE083CF60FE9050"/>
near a table, covered with papers, which he appeared to be examining.</p>
                     <p>"I ſent for you, Emily," ſaid Montoni, raiſing his head, "that you might be a witneſs in ſome buſineſs, which I am tranſacting with my friend Orſino. All that is required of you will be to ſign your name to this paper:" he then took one up, hurried unintelligibly over ſome lines, and, laying it before her on the table, offered her a pen. She took it, and was going to write—when the deſign of Montoni came upon her mind like a flaſh of lightning; ſhe trembled, let the pen fall, and refuſed to ſign what ſhe had not read. Montoni affected to laugh at her ſcruples, and, taking up the paper, again pretended to read; but Emily, who ſtill trembled on perceiving her danger, and was aſtoniſhed, that her own credulity had ſo nearly betrayed her, poſitively refuſed to ſign any paper whatever. Montoni, for ſometime, perſevered in affecting to ridicule this refuſal; but, when he perceived by her ſteady perſeverance, that ſhe underſtood his deſign, he changed his manner, and bade her follow him to another room. There he told her, that he had been willing to ſpare himſelf and her the trouble of uſeleſs conteſt, in an affair where his will was juſtice, and where ſhe ſhould find it law; and had, therefore, endeavoured to perſuade, rather than to compel, her to the practice of her duty.</p>
                     <p>"I, as the huſband of the late Signora Montoni," he added, "am the heir of all ſhe poſſeſſed; the eſtates, therefore, which ſhe refuſed to me in her lifetime, can no longer be withheld, and, for your own ſake, I would undeceive you, reſpecting a fooliſh aſſertion ſhe once made to you in my hearing—that theſe eſtates would be yours, if ſhe died without reſigning them to me.

                     <p>Montoni <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, it was evident, that he conſidered it to be a predominant one, ſince he deſigned to ſacrifice to hers the character and underſtanding of her whole ſex.</p>
                     <p>"Judging as I do," reſumed Montoni, "I cannot believe you will oppoſe, where you know you cannot conquer, or, indeed, that you would wiſh to conquer, or be avaricious of any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, when you have not juſtice on your ſide. I think it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, however, to acquaint you with the alternative. If you have a juſt opinion of the ſubject in queſtion, you ſhall be allowed a ſafe conveyance to France, within a ſhort period; but, if you are ſo unhappy as to be miſled by the late aſſertion of the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora, you ſhall remain my priſoner, till you are convinced of your error."</p>
                     <p>Emily calmly ſaid,</p>
                     <p>"I am not ſo ignorant, Signor, of the laws on this ſubject, as to be miſled by the aſſertion of any perſon. The law, in the preſent inſtance, gives me the eſtates in queſtion, and my own hand ſhall never betray my right."</p>
                     <p>"I have been miſtaken in my opinion of you, it appears," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined Montoni, ſternly. "You ſpeak boldly, and preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, upon a ſubject, which you do not underſtand. For once, I am willing to pardon the conceit of ignorance; the weakneſs of your ſex, too, from which, it ſeems you are not exempt, claims ſome allowance; but, if you perſiſt in this ſtrain—you have every thing to fear from my juſtice."</p>
                     <p>"From your juſtice, Signor," rejoined Emily, "I have noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to fear—I have only to hope."</p>
                     <p>Montoni looked at her with vexation, and ſeemed conſidering what to ſay. "I find that you are weak enough," he reſumed, "to credit the idle aſſertion I alluded to! For your own ſake I lament this; as to me, it is of little conſequence.

Recollecting, that it was for Valancourt's ſake ſhe had thou reſiſted, ſhe now ſmiled complacently upon the threatened ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and retired to the ſpot, which her aunt had pointed out as the repoſitory of the papers, relative to the eſtates, where ſhe found them as deſcribed; and, ſince ſhe knew of no better place of concealment, than this, returned them, without examining their contents, being fearful of diſcovery, while ſhe ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt a peruſal.</p>
                     <p>To her own ſolitary chamber ſhe once more returned, and there thought again of the late converſation with Montoni, and of the evil ſhe might expect from oppoſition to his will. But his power did not appear ſo terrible to her imagination, as it was wont to do: a ſacred pride was in her heart, that taught it to ſwell againſt the preſſure of injuſtice, and almoſt to glory in the quiet ſufferance of ills, in a cauſe, which had alſo the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of Valancourt for its object. For the firſt time, ſhe felt the full extent of her own ſuperiority to Montoni, and deſpiſed the authority, which, till now, ſhe had only feared.</p>
                     <p>As ſhe ſat muſing a peal of laughter roſe from the terrace, and, on going to the caſement, ſhe ſaw, with inexpreſſible ſurpriſe, three ladies, dreſſed in the gala habit of Venice, walking with ſeveral gentlemen below. She gazed in an aſtoniſhment that made her remain at the window, regardleſs of being obſerved, till the group paſſed under it; and, one of the ſtrangers looking up, ſhe perceived the features of Signora Livona, with whoſe manners ſhe had been ſo much charmed, the day after her ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival at Venice, and who had been there introduced at the table of Montoni. This diſcovery occaſioned her an emotion of doubtful joy; for it was matter of joy and comfort to know, that a perſon, of a mind ſo gentle, as that of Signora Livona ſeemed to be, was near her; yet there was ſomething ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary in her being at this caſtle, circumſtanced as know was, and evidently, by the gaiety of her air, with her own conſent, that a very painful ſurmiſe aroſe, concerning her character. But the thought was ſo ſhocking to Emily, whoſe affection the faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinating manners of the Signora had won, and appeared ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, when ſhe remembered theſe manners, that ſhe diſmiſſed it almoſt inſtantly.</p>
                     <p>On Annette's appearance, however, ſhe inquired, concerning theſe ſtrangers; and the former was as eager to tell as Emily was to learn.</p>
                     <p>"They are juſt come, ma'amſelle," ſaid Annette, "with two Signors from Venice, and I was glad to ſee ſuch Chriſtian faces
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:029378_0196_0FE083D4053A7488"/>
once again.—But what can they mean by coming here? They muſt ſurely be ſtark mad to come freely to ſuch a place as this! Yet they do come freely, for they ſeem merry enough, I am ſure."</p>
                     <p>"They were taken priſoners, perhaps?" ſaid Emily.</p>
                     <p>"Taken priſoners!" exclaimed Annette; "no, indeed, ma'amſelle, not they. I remember one of them very well at Venice: ſhe came two or three times to the Signor's, you know, ma'amſelle, and it was ſaid, but I did not believe a word of it—it was ſaid, that the Signor liked her better than he ſhould do. Then, why, ſays I, bring her to my lady? Very true, ſaid Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovico; but he looked as if he knew more, too."</p>
                     <p>Emily deſired Annette would endeavour to learn who theſe ladies were, as well as all ſhe could concerning them; and ſhe then changed the ſubject, and ſpoke of diſtant France.</p>
                     <p>"Ah, ma'amſelle! we ſhall never ſee it more!" ſaid An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette, almoſt weeping.—"I muſt come on my travels, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth!"</p>
                     <p>Emily tried to ſooth and to cheer her with a hope, in which ſhe ſcarcely herſelf indulged.</p>
                     <p>"How—how, ma'amſelle, could you leave France, and leave Monſ. Valancourt, too?" ſaid Annette, ſobbing. "I—I—am ſure, if Ludovico had been in France, I would never have left it."</p>
                     <p>"Why do you lament quitting France, then?" ſaid Emily, trying to ſmile, "ſince, if you had remained there, you would not have found Ludovico."</p>
                     <p>"Ah, ma'amſelle! I only wiſh I was out of this frightful caſtle, ſerving you in France, and I would care about nothing elſe!"</p>
                     <p>"Thank you, my good Annette, for your affectionate regard, the time will come, I hope, when you may remember the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of that wiſh with pleaſure."</p>
                     <p>Annette departed on her buſineſs, and Emily ſought to loſe the ſenſe of her own cares, in the viſionary ſcenes of the poet; but ſhe had again to lament the irreſiſtable force of circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces over the taſte and powers of the mind; and that it requires a ſpirit at eaſe to be ſenſible even to the abſtract pleaſures of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>re intellect. The enthuſiaſm of genius, with all its pictured <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, now appeared cold, and dim. As ſhe muſed upon the book before her, ſhe involuntarily exclaimed, "Are theſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the paſſages, that have ſo often given me exquiſite delight. Where did the charm exiſt?—Was it in my mind, or in the imagination of the poet? It lived in each," ſaid ſhe pauſing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="166" facs="unknown:029378_0197_0FE083E125EA9AA0"/>
"But the fire of the poet is vain, if the mind of his reader is not tempered like his own, however it may be inferior to his in power."</p>
                     <p>Emily would have purſued this train of thinking, becauſe it relieved her from more painful reflection, but ſhe found again, that thought cannot always be controlled by will; and hers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the conſideration of her own ſituation.</p>
                     <p>In the evening, not chooſing to venture down to the ramparts, where ſhe would be expoſed to the rude gaze of Montoni's aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates, ſhe walked for air in the gallery, adjoining her chamber; on reaching the further end of which ſhe heard diſtant ſounds of merriment and laughter. It was the wild uproar of riot, not the cheering gaiety of tempered mirth; and ſeemed to come from that part of the caſtle, where Montoni uſually was. Such ſounds, at this time, when her aunt had been ſo few days dead, particularly ſhocked her, conſiſtent as they were with the late conduct of Montoni.</p>
                     <p>As ſhe liſtened, ſhe thought ſhe diſtinguiſhed female voices mingling with the laughter, and this confirmed her worſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe concerning the character of Signora Livona and her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. It was evident that they had not been brought hither by compulſion; and ſhe beheld herſelf in the remote wilds of the Apennine, ſurrounded by men, whom ſhe conſidered to be little leſs than ruffians, and their worſt aſſociates, amid ſcenes of vice, from which her ſoul recoiled in horror. It was at this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when the ſcenes of the preſent and the future opened to her imagination, that the image of Valancourt failed in its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, and her reſolution ſhook with dread. She thought ſhe underſtood all the horrors, which Montoni was preparing for her, and ſhrunk from an encounter with ſuch remorſeleſs ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, as he could inflict. The diſputed eſtates ſhe now almoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to yield at once, whenever he ſhould again call upon her, that ſhe might regain ſafety and freedom; but then, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Valancourt would ſteal to her heart, and plunge her into the diſtractions of doubt.</p>
                     <p>She continued walking in the gallery, till evening threw its melancholy twilight through the painted caſements, and deepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the gloom of the oak wainſcoting around her; while the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant perſpective of the corridor was ſo much obſcured, as to be diſcernable only by the glimmering window, that terminated it.</p>
                     <p>Along the vaulted halls and paſſages below, peals of laughter echoed faintly, at intervals, to this remote part of the caſtle, and ſeemed to render the ſucceeding ſtillneſs more dreary. Emily, however, unwilling to return to her more forlorn chamber, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:029378_0197_0FE083E125EA9AA0"/>
Annette was not yet come, ſtill paced the gallery. As ſhe paſſed the door of the apartment, where ſhe had once dared to lift the veil, which diſcovered to her a ſpectacle ſo horrible, that ſhe had never after remembered it, but with emotions of indeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribable awe, this remembrance ſuddenly recurred. It now brought with it reflections more terrible, than it had yet done, which the late conduct of Montoni occaſioned; and, haſtening to quit the gallery, while ſhe had power to do ſo, ſhe heard a ſudden ſtep behind her. It might be that of Annette; but, turning fearfully to look, ſhe ſaw, through the gloom, a tall figure following her, and all the horrors of that chamber ruſhed upon her mind. In the next moment, ſhe found herſelf claſped in the arms of ſome perſon, and heard a deep voice murmur in her ear.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe had power to ſpeak, or to diſtinguiſh articulated ſounds, ſhe demanded who detained her.</p>
                     <p>"It is I," replied the voice—"Why are you thus alarmed?"</p>
                     <p>She looked on the face of the perſon who ſpoke, but the feeble light that gleamed through the high caſement at the end of the gallery, did not permit her to diſtinguiſh the features.</p>
                     <p>"Whoever you are," ſaid Emily in a trembling voice, "for heaven's ſake let me go!"</p>
                     <p>"My charming Emily," ſaid the man, "why will you ſhut yourſelf up in this obſcure place, when there is ſo much gaiety below? Return with me to the cedar parlour, where you will be the faireſt ornament of the party; you ſhall not repent the exchange."</p>
                     <p>Emily diſdained to reply, and ſtill endeavoured to liberate herſelf.</p>
                     <p>"Promiſe, that you will come," he continued, "and I will releaſe you immediately; but firſt give me a reward for ſo doing."</p>
                     <p>"Who are you?" demanded Emily, in a tone of mingled terror and indignation, while ſhe ſtill ſtruggled for liberty—"Who are you, that have the cruelty thus to inſult me?"</p>
                     <p>"Why call me cruel?" ſaid the man, "I would remove you from this dreary ſolitude to a merry party below. Do you not know me?"</p>
                     <p>Emily now faintly remembered, that he was one of the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers who were with Montoni when ſhe attended him in the morning. "I thank you for the kindneſs of your intention," ſhe replied, without appearing to underſtand him, "but I wiſh for nothing ſo much as that you would leave me."</p>
                     <p>"Charming Emily!" ſaid he, "give up this fooliſh whim for ſolitude, and come with me to the company, and eclipſe the
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:029378_0198_0FE083E5B4A1B970"/>
beauties, who make part of it; you, only, are worthy of my love." He attempted to kiſs her hand, but the ſtrong impulſe of her indignation gave her power to liberate herſelf, and ſhe fled towards the chamber. She cloſed the door, before he reached it, having ſecured which, ſhe ſunk in a chair, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by terror and by the exertion ſhe had made, while ſhe heard his voice and his attempts to open the door, without having the power to raiſe herſelf. At length, ſhe perceived him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and had remained, liſtening, for a conſiderable time, and was ſomewhat revived by not hearing any ſound, when ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhe remembered the door of the private ſtaircaſe, and that he might enter that way, ſince it was faſtened only on the other ſide. She then employed herſelf in endeavouring to ſecure it, in the manner ſhe had formerly done. It appeared to her, that Montoni had already commenced his ſcheme of vengeance, by withdrawing from her his protection, and ſhe repented of the raſhneſs, that had made her brave the power of ſuch a man.—To retain the eſtates ſeemed to be now utterly impoſſible, and to preſerve her life, perhaps her honour, ſhe reſolved, if ſhe ſhould eſcape the horrors of this night, to give up all claims to the eſtates, on the morrow, provided Montoni would ſuffer her to depart from Udolpho.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe had come to this deciſion, her mind became more compoſed, though ſhe ſtill anxiouſly liſtened, and often ſtarted at ideal ſounds, that appeared to iſſue from the ſtaircaſe.</p>
                     <p>Having ſat in darkneſs for ſome hours, during all which time Annette did not appear, ſhe began to have ſerious apprehenſions for her; but, not daring to venture down into the caſtle, was compelled to remain in uncertainty, as to the cauſe of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual abſence.</p>
                     <p>Emily often ſtole to the ſtaircaſe door, to liſten if any ſtep approached, but ſtill no ſound alarmed her: determining, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to watch, during the night, ſhe once more reſted on her dark and deſolate couch, and bathed the pillow with innocent tears. She thought of her deceaſed parents and then of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Valancourt, and frequently called upon their names; for the profound ſtillneſs, that now reigned, was propitious to the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſorrow of her mind.</p>
                     <p>While ſhe thus remained, her ear ſuddenly caught the notes of diſtant muſic, to which ſhe liſtened attentively, and ſoon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving this to be the inſtrument ſhe had formerly heard at midnight, ſhe roſe, and ſtepped ſoftly to the caſement, to which the ſounds appeared to come from a lower room.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="169" facs="unknown:029378_0198_0FE083E5B4A1B970"/>
In a few moments their ſoft melody was accompanied by a voice ſo full of pathos, that it evidently ſang not of imaginary ſorrows. Its ſweet and peculiar tones ſhe thought ſhe had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where heard before; yet, if this was not fancy, it was, at moſt, a very faint recollection. It ſtole over her mind, amidſt the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of her preſent ſuffering, like a celeſtial ſtrain, ſoothing and reaſſuring her;—"Pleaſant as the gale of ſpring, that ſighs on the hunter's ear, when he awakens from dreams of joy and has heard the muſic of the ſpirits of the hill.<note n="*" place="bottom">Oſſian.</note>."</p>
                     <p>But her emotion can ſcarcely be imagined, when ſhe heard ſung, with the taſte and ſimplicity of true feeling, one of the popular airs of her native province, to which ſhe had ſo often liſtened with delight, when a child, and which ſhe had ſo often heard her father repeat! To this well known ſong, never till now, heard but in her native country, her heart melted, while, the memory of paſt times returned. The pleaſant, peaceful, ſcenes of Gaſcony, the tenderneſs and goodneſs of her parents, the taſte and ſimplicity of her former life—all roſe to her fancy, and formed a picture, ſo ſweet and glowing, ſo ſtrikingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſted with the ſcenes, the characters and the dangers, which now ſurrounded her—that her mind could not bear to pauſe upon the retroſpect, and ſhrunk at the acuteneſs of its own ſufferings.</p>
                     <p>Her ſighs were deep and convulſed; ſhe could no longer liſten to the ſtrain, that had ſo often charmed her to tranquillity, and ſhe withdrew from the caſement to a remote part of the chamber. But ſhe was not yet beyond the reach of the muſic; ſhe heard the meaſure change, and the ſucceeding air called her again to the window, for ſhe immediately recollected it to be the ſame ſhe had formerly heard in the fiſhing houſe in Gaſcony. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, perhaps, by the myſtery, which had then accompanied this ſtrain, it had made ſo deep an impreſſion on her memory, that ſhe had never ſince entirely forgotten it; and the manner, in which it was now ſung, convinced her, however unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the circumſtance appeared, that this was the ſame voice ſhe had then heard. Surpriſe ſoon yielded to other emotions; a thought darted, like lightning, upon her mind, which diſcovered a train of hopes, that revived all her ſpirits. Yet theſe hopes were ſo new, ſo unexpected, ſo aſtoniſhing, that ſhe did not dare to truſt, though ſhe could not reſolve to diſcourage them. She ſat down by the caſement, breathleſs, and overcome with the alternate emotions of hope and fear; then roſe again, leaned from the window, that ſhe might catch a nearer ſound, liſtened,
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:029378_0199_0FE083F0A2DAFD28"/>
now doubting and then believing, ſoftly exclaimed the name of Valancourt, and then ſunk again into the chair. Yes, it was poſſible, that Valancourt was near her, and ſhe recollected cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, which induced her to believe it was his voice ſhe had juſt heard. She remembered he had more than once ſaid that the fiſhing houſe, where ſhe had formerly liſtened to his voice and air, and where ſhe had ſeen pencilled ſonnets, addreſſed to herſelf, had been his favourite haun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, before he had been made known to her; there, too, ſhe had herſelf unexpectedly met him. It appeared, from theſe circumſtances, more than probable, that he was the muſician, who had formerly charmed her attention, and the author of the lines, which had expreſſed ſuch tender ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration;—who elſe, indeed could it be? She was unable at that time to form a conjecture, as to the writer, but, ſince her acquaintance with Valancourt, whenever he had mentioned the fiſhing houſe to have been known to him, ſhe had not ſcrupled to believe that he was the author of the ſonnets.</p>
                     <p>As theſe conſiderations paſſed over her mind, joy, fear and tenderneſs contended at her heart; ſhe leaned again from the caſement to catch the ſounds, which might confirm, or deſtroy her hope, though ſhe did not recollect to have ever heard him ſing; but the voice, and the inſtrument, now ceaſed.</p>
                     <p>She conſidered for a moment whether ſhe ſhould venture to ſpeak: then, not chooſing, leſt it ſhould be he, to mention his name, and yet too much intereſted to neglect the opportunity of inquiring, ſhe called from the caſement, "Is that ſong from Gaſcony?" Her anxious attention was not cheered by any reply; every thing remained ſilent. Her impatience increaſing with her fears, ſhe repeated the queſtion; but ſtill no ſound was heard, except the ſighings of the wind among the battlements above; and ſhe endeavoured to conſole herſelf with a belief, that the ſtranger, whoever he was, had retired, before ſhe had ſpoken, beyond the reach of her voice, which it appeared certain, had Valancourt heard and recognized, he would inſtantly have repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to. Preſently, however, ſhe conſidered, that a motive of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and not an accidental removal might occaſion his ſilence; but the ſurmiſe, that led to this reflection, ſuddenly changed her hope and joy to terror and grief; for, if Valancourt were in the caſtle, it was too probable, that he was here a priſoner, taken with ſome of his countrymen, many of whom were at that time engaged in the wars of Italy, or intercepted in ſome attempt to reach her. Had he even recollected Emily's voice, he would have feared, in theſe circumſtances, to reply to it, in the preſence of the men, who guarded his priſon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="171" facs="unknown:029378_0199_0FE083F0A2DAFD28"/>
What ſo lately ſhe had eagerly hoped ſhe now believed ſhe dreaded;—dreaded to know that Valancourt was near her; and, while ſhe was anxious to be relieved from her apprehenſion for his ſafety, ſhe ſtill was unconſcious, that a hope of ſoon ſeeing him, ſtruggled with the fear.</p>
                     <p>She remained liſtening at the caſement, till the air began to freſhen, and one high mountain in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Now ſhe roſe from the couch, and opened the caſement to liſten; then ſhe would pace the room with impatient ſteps, and, at length, return with deſpondence to her pillow. Never did hours appear to move ſo heavily, as thoſe of this anxious night; after which ſhe hoped that Annette might appear, and conclude her preſent ſtate of torturing ſuſpenſe.</p>

                     <p>IN the morning, Emily was relieved from her fears for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette, who came at an early hour.</p>
                     <p>"Here were fine doings in the caſtle, laſt night, ma'amſelle," ſaid ſhe, as ſoon as ſhe entered the room,—"fine doings, indeed! Was you not frightened, ma'amſelle, at not ſeeing me?"</p>
                     <p>"I was alarmed both on your account and on my own," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Emily—"What detained you?"</p>
                     <p>"Aye, I ſaid ſo, I told him ſo; but it would not do. It was not my fault, indeed, ma'amſelle, for I could not get out. The rogue Ludovico locked me up again."</p>
                     <p>"Locked you up!" ſaid Emily, with diſpleaſure, "Why do you permit Ludovico to lock you up?"</p>
                     <p>"Holy Saints!" exclaimed Annette," how can I help it! If he will lock the door, ma'amſelle, and take away the key, how
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:029378_0200_0FE083F685175C28"/>
am I to get out, unleſs I jump through the window? But that I ſhould not mind ſo much, if the caſements here were not all ſo high; one can hardly ſcramble up to them on the inſide, and one ſhould break one's neck, I ſuppoſe going down on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. But you know, I dare ſay, ma'am, what a hurly burly the caſtle was in, laſt night; you muſt have heard ſome of the uproar."</p>
                     <p>"What, were they diſputing, then?" ſaid Emily.</p>
                     <p>"No, ma'amſelle, not fighting, but almoſt as good, for I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there was not one of the Signors ſober; and what is more, not one of thoſe fine ladies ſober, either. I thought, when I ſaw them firſt, that all thoſe fine ſilks and fine veils,—why, ma'amſelle, their veils were worked with ſilver! and fine trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings—boded no good—I gueſſed what they were!"</p>
                     <p>"Good God!" exclaimed Emily, "what will become of me!"</p>
                     <p>"Ave, ma'am, Ludovico ſaid much the ſame thing of me. Good God! ſaid he, Annette, what is to become of you, if you are to go running about the caſtle among all theſe drunken Signors?"</p>
                     <p>"O! ſays I, for that matter I only want to go to my young lady's chamber, and I have only to go, you know, along the vaulted paſſage and acroſs the great hall and up the marble ſtair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe and along the north gallery and through the weſt wing of the caſtle, and I am in the corridor in a minute." "Are you ſo? ſays he, and what is to become of you, if you meet any of thoſe noble cavaliers in the way?" "Well, ſays I, if you think there is danger, then, go with me, and guard me; I am never afraid when you are by." "What! ſays he, when I am ſcarcely recovered of one wound, ſhall I put myſelf in the way of getting another? for if any of the cavaliers meet you, they will fall a fighting with me directly. No, no, ſays he, I will cut the way ſhorter, than through the vaulted paſſage and up the marble ſtaircaſe and along the north gallery and through the weſt wing of the caſtle, for you ſhall ſtay here, Annette; you ſhall not go out of this room, to night." "So, with that I ſays"—</p>
                     <p>"Well, well," ſaid Emily, impatiently, and anxious to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire on another ſubject,—"ſo he locked you up?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, he did indeed, ma'amſelle, notwithſtanding all I could ſay to the contrary; and Catarina and I and he ſtaid there all night. And in a few minutes after I was not ſo vexed, for there came Signor Verezzi roaring along the paſſage, like a mad bull, and he miſtook Ludovico's hall, for old Carlo's; ſo he tried to burſt open the door, and called out for more wine, for that he had drunk all the flaſks dry, and was dying of thirſt.
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:029378_0200_0FE083F685175C28"/>
So we were all as ſtill as night, that he might ſuppoſe there was nobody in the room; but the Signor was as cunning as the beſt of us, and kept calling out at the door, "Come forth, my ancient hero!" ſaid he, "here is no enemy at the gate, that you need hide yourſelf: come forth, my valorous Signor Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard!" Juſt then old Carlo opened his door, and he came with a flaſk in his hand; for, as ſoon as the Signor ſaw him, he was as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ame as could be, and followed him away as naturally as a dog does a butcher with a piece of meat in his baſket. All this I ſaw through the keyhole. "Well, Annette," ſaid Ludovico, jeer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, "ſhall I let you out now?" "O no, ſays, I, I would not."</p>
                     <p>"I have ſome queſtions to aſk you on another ſubject," inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Emily, quite wearied by this ſtory. "Do you know whether there are any priſoners in the caſtle, and whether they are confined at this end of the edifice?"</p>
                     <p>"I was not in the way, ma'amſelle," replied Annette, "when the firſt party came in from the mountains, and the laſt party is not come back yet, ſo I don't know, whether there are any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners; but it is expected back to-night, or to-morrow, and I ſhall know then, perhaps."</p>
                     <p>Emily inquired if ſhe had ever heard the ſervants talk of priſoners.</p>
                     <p>"Ah ma'amſelle!" ſaid Annette archly, "now I dare ſay you are thinking of Monſieur Valancourt, and that he may have come among the armies, which, they ſay, are come from our country, to fight againſt this ſtate, and that he has met with ſome of <hi>our</hi> people, and is taken captive. O Lord! how glad I ſhould be, if it was ſo!"</p>
                     <p>"Would you, indeed, be glad?" ſaid Emily, in a tone of mournful reproach.</p>
                     <p>"To be ſure I ſhould, ma'am," replied Annette, "and would not you be glad too, to ſee Signor Valancourt? I don't know any chevalier I like better, I have a very great regard for the Signor, truly."</p>
                     <p>"Your regard for him cannot be doubted," ſaid Emily, "ſince you wiſh to ſee him a priſoner."</p>
                     <p>"Why no, ma'amſelle, not a priſoner either; but one muſt be glad to ſee him, you know. And it was only the other night I dreamt—I dreamt I ſaw him drive <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Emily could not forbear ſmiling at Annette's ideas of Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court, and repeated her inquiry, whether ſhe had heard the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants talk priſoners.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="174" facs="unknown:029378_0201_0FE08403EF8A97E0"/>
"No, ma'amſelle," replied ſhe, "never; and lately they have done nothing but talk of the apparition, that has been walking about of a night on the ramparts, and that frightened the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels into ſits. It came among them like a flaſh of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> and then it was gone, and nothing to be ſeen but the old caſtle walls; ſo they helped one another up again as faſt as they could. You would not believe ma'amſelle though I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you the very cannon, where it uſed to appear."</p>
                     <p>"And are you, indeed, ſo ſimple, Annette," ſaid Emily, ſmil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at this curious exaggeration of the circumſtance ſhe had wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed, "as to credit theſe ſtories?"</p>
                     <p>"Credit them, ma'amſelle! why all the world could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade me out of them. Roberto and Sebaſtian and half a dozen more of them went into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>its! To be ſure, there was no occaſion for that; I ſaid, myſelf, there was no need of that, for, ſays I, when the enemy comes, what a pretty figure they will cut, if they are to fall down in fits, all of a row! The enemy won't be ſo civil, perhaps, as to walk off, like the ghoſt, and leave them to help one another up, but will fall to, cutting and ſlaſhing, till he makes tham all riſe up dead men. No, no, ſays I, there is reaſon in all things: though I might have fallen down in a fit, that was no rule for them, being, becauſe it is no buſineſs of mine to look gruff, and fight battles."</p>
                     <p>Emily endeavoured to correct the ſuperſtitious weakneſs of Annette, though ſhe could not entirely ſubdue her own; to which the latter only replied, "Nay, ma'amſelle, you will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve nothing; you are almoſt as bad as the Signor himſelf, who was in a great paſſion when they told him of what had happened, and ſwore that the firſt man who repeated ſuch nonſenſe ſhould be thrown into the dungeon under the eaſt turret. This was a hard puniſhment too, for only talking nonſenſe, as he called it, but I dare ſay he had other reaſons for calling it ſo, than you have, ma'am."</p>
                     <p>Emily looked diſpleaſed, and made no reply. As ſhe muſed upon the recollected appearance, which had lately ſo much alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, and conſidered the circumſtances of the figure having ſtationed itſelf oppoſite to her caſement, ſhe was for a moment inclined to believe it was Valancourt, whom ſhe had ſeen.

unable to decide, whether the muſician and the form ſhe had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, were the ſame, or if they were, whether this was Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt. She, however, deſired that Annette would endeavour to learn whether any priſoners were in the caſtle, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> alſo their names.</p>
                     <p>"O dear, ma'amſelle!" ſaid Annette, "I forgot to tell you what you bade me aſk about the ladies, as they call themſelves, who are lately come to Udolpho. Why that Signora Livona, that the Signor brought to ſee my late lady at Venice, is his miſtreſs now, and was little better then, I dare ſay. And Ludovico ſays, but pray be ſecret, ma'am, that his <hi>Excellenza</hi> introduced her only to impoſe upon the world, that had begun to make free with her character. So when people ſaw my lady notice her, they thought what they had heard muſt be ſcandal. The other two are the miſtreſſes of Signor Verezzi and Signor Bertolini; and Signor Montoni invited them all to the caſtle; and ſo, yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day he gave a great entertainment; and there they were, all drinking Tuſcany wine and all ſorts, and laughing and ſinging, till they made the caſtle ring again. But I thought they were diſmal ſounds, ſo ſoon after my poor lady's death too; and they brought to my mind what ſhe would have thought, if ſhe had heard them—but ſhe cannot hear them now, poor ſoul! ſaid I."</p>
                     <p>Emily turned away to conceal her emotion, and then deſired Annette to go, and make inquiry, concerning the priſoners, that might be in the caſtle, but conjured her to do it with caution, and on no account to mention her name, or that of Monſieur Valancourt.</p>
                     <p>"Now I think of it ma'amſelle," ſaid Annette, "I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there are priſoners, for I overheard one of the Signor's men yeſterday, in the ſervants' hall, talking ſomething about ranſoms, and ſaying what a fine thing it was for his <hi>Excellenza</hi> to catch up men, and they were as good booty as any other, becauſe of the ranſoms. And the other man was grumbling, and ſaying it was fine enough for the Signor, but none ſo fine for his ſoldiers, becauſe, ſaid he, we dont' go ſhares there."</p>
                     <p>This information heightened Emily's impatience to know more, and Annette immediately departed on her inquiry.</p>
                     <p>The late reſolution of Emily to reſign her eſtates to Montoni, now gave way to new conſiderations; the poſſibility, that Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt was near her, revived her fortitude, and ſhe determined to brave the threatened vengeance, at leaſt, till ſhe could be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured whether he was really in the caſtle. She was in this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of mind when ſhe received a meſſage from Montoni, requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:029378_0202_0FE08408A68BEB80"/>
her attendance in the cedar parlour, which ſhe obeyed with trembling, and, on her way thither, endeavoured to animate her fortitude with the idea of Valancourt.</p>
                     <p>Montoni was alone. "I ſent for you," ſaid he, "to give you another opportunity of retracting your late miſtaken aſſertions concerning the Languedoc eſtates. I will condeſcend to adviſe, where I may command.—If you are really deluded by an opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, that you have any right to theſe eſtates, at leaſt, do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the error—an error, which you may perceive, too late, has been fatal to you. Dare my reſentment no further, but ſign the papers."</p>
                     <p>"If I have no right in theſe eſtates, ſir," ſaid Emily, "of what ſervice can it be to you, that I ſhould ſign any papers, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them? If the lands are yours by law, you certainly may poſſeſs them, without my interference, or my conſent."</p>
                     <p>"I will have no more argument," ſaid Montoni, with a look that made her tremble. "What had I but trouble to expect, when I condeſcended to reaſon with a baby! But I will be tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled with no longer: let the recollection of your aunt's ſufferings in conſequence of her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Emily's reſolution was for a moment awed:—ſhe ſhrunk at the recollections he revived, and from the vengeance he threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but then, the image of Valancourt, who ſo long had loved her, and who was now, perhaps ſo near her, came to her heart, and, together with the ſtrongeſt feelings of indignation, with which ſhe had always from her infancy, regarded an act of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, inſpired her with a noble, though imprudent, courage.</p>
                     <p>"Sign the papers," ſaid Montoni, more impatiently than before.</p>
                     <p>"Never ſir," replied Emily; "that requeſt would have prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me the injuſtice of your claim, had I even been ignorant of my right."</p>
                     <p>Montoni turned pale with anger, while his quivering lip and lurking eye made her almoſt repent the boldneſs of her ſpeech.</p>
                     <p>"Then all my vengeance falls upon you," he exclaimed, with an horrible oath. "And think not it ſhall be delayed. Neither the eſtates in Languedoc, or Gaſcony, ſhall be yours; you have dared to queſtion my right,—now dare to queſtion my power. I have a puniſhment which you think not of; it is terrible! This night—this very night"—</p>
                     <p>"This night!" repeated another voice.</p>
                     <p>Montoni pauſed, and turned half round, but, ſeeming to recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect himſelf he proceeded in a lower tone.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="177" facs="unknown:029378_0202_0FE08408A68BEB80"/>
"You have lately ſeen one terrible example of obſtinacy and folly; yet this, it appears, has not been ſufficient to deter you. I could tell you of others—I could make you tremble at the bare recital."</p>
                     <p>He was interrupted by a groan, which ſeemed to riſe from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath the chamber they were in; and, as he threw a glance round it, impatience and rage flaſhed from his eyes, yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like a ſhade of fear paſſed over his countenance. Emily ſat down in a chair near the door, for the various emotions ſhe had ſuffered, now almoſt overcame her; but Montoni pauſed ſcarcely an inſtant, and, commanding his features, reſumed his diſcourſe in a lower, yet ſterner voice.</p>
                     <p>"I ſay, I could give you other inſtances of my power and of my character, which it ſeems you do not underſtand, or you would not defy me. I could tell you, that, when once my reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution is taken—but I am talking to a baby. Let me, however, repeat, that terrible as are the example I could recite, the recital could not now benefit you; for, though your repentance would put an immediate end to oppoſition, it would not now appeaſe my indignation.—I will have vengeance as well as juſtice."</p>
                     <p>Another groan filled the pauſe which Montoni made.</p>
                     <p>"Leave the room inſtantly!" ſaid he, ſeeming not to notice this ſtrange occurrence. Without power to implore his pity, ſhe roſe to go, but found that ſhe could not ſupport herſelf; awe and terror overcame her, and ſhe ſunk again into the chair.</p>
                     <p>"Quit my preſence!" cried Montoni. "This affectation of fear ill becomes the heroine who has juſt dared to brave my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation."</p>
                     <p>"Did you hear nothing Signor?" ſaid Emily, trembling, and ſtill unable to leave the room.</p>
                     <p>"I heard my own voice," rejoined Montoni, ſternly.</p>
                     <p>"And nothing elſe?" ſaid Emily, ſpeaking with difficulty.—"There again! Do you hear nothing now?"</p>
                     <p>"Obey my order," repeated Montoni. "And for theſe fool's tricks—I will ſoon diſcover by whom they are practiſed."</p>
                     <p>Emily again roſe, and exerted herſelf to the utmoſt to leave the room, while Montoni followed her; but, inſtead of calling aloud to his ſervants to ſearch the chamber, as he had formerly done on a ſimilar occurrence, paſſed to the ramparts.</p>
                     <p>As, in her way to the corridor, ſhe reſted for a moment at an open caſement, Emily ſaw a party of Montoni's troops winding down a diſtant mountain, whom ſhe noticed no further, than as
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:029378_0203_0FE0841564CCE218"/>
they brought to her mind the wretched priſoners they were, perhaps, bringing to the caſtle. At length, having reached her apartment, ſhe threw herſelf upon a couch, overcome with the new horrors of her ſituation. Her thoughts loſt in tumult and perplexity, ſhe could neither repent of, or approve, her late conduct; ſhe could only remember, that ſhe was in the power of a man, who had no principle of action—but his will; and the aſtoniſhment and terrors of ſuperſtition, which had, for a moment, ſo ſtrongly aſſailed her, now yielded to thoſe of reaſon.</p>
                     <p>She was, at length, rouſed from the reverie, which engaged her, by a confuſion of diſtant voices, and a clattering of hoofs, that ſeemed to come, on the wind, from the courts. A ſudden hope, that ſome good was approaching, ſeized her mind, till ſhe remembered the troops ſhe had obſerved from the caſement, and concluded this to be the party, which Annette had ſaid were expected at Udolpho.</p>
                     <p>Soon after, ſhe heard voices faintly from the halls, and the noiſe of horſes' feet ſunk away in the wind; ſilence enſued. Emily liſtened anxiouſly for Annette's ſtep in the corridor, but a pauſe of total ſtillneſs continued, till again the caſtle ſeemed to be all tumult and confuſion. She heard the echoes of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> footſteps, paſſing to and fro in the halls and avenues below, and then buſy tongues were loud on the rampart. Having hurried to her caſement, ſhe perceived Montoni, with ſome of his offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, leaning on the walls, and pointing from them; while ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſoldiers were employed at the further end of the rampart about ſome cannon; and ſhe continued to obſerve them, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of the paſſing time.</p>
                     <p>Annette at length appeared, but brought no intelligence of Valancourt, "For, ma'amſelle," ſaid ſhe, "all the people pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to kno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> nothing about any priſoners. But here is a fine piece of buſineſs! The reſt of the party are juſt arrived, ma'am; they came ſcampering in, as if they would have broken their necks; one ſcarcely knew whether the man, or his horſe would get within the gates firſt. And they have brought word—and ſuch news! they have brought word, that a party of the enemy, as they call them, are coming towards the caſtle; ſo we ſhall have all the officers of juſtice, I ſuppoſe, beſieging it! all thoſe terrible looking fellows one uſed to ſee at Venice."</p>
                     <p>"Thank God!" exclaimed Emily, fervently, "there is yet a hope left for me, then!"</p>
                     <p>"What mean you, ma'amſelle? Do you wiſh to fall into the hands of thoſe ſad looking men! Why I uſed to ſhudder as I
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:029378_0203_0FE0841564CCE218"/>
paſſed them, and ſhould have gueſſed what they were, if Ludov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ico had not told me."</p>
                     <p>"We cannot be in worſe hands than at preſent," replied Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily, unguardedly; "but what reaſon have you to ſuppoſe theſe are officers of juſtice?"</p>
                     <p>"Why <hi>our</hi> people, ma'am, are all in ſuch a fright, and a fuſs; and I don't know any thing but the fear of juſtice, that could make them ſo. I uſed to think nothing on earth could fluſter them, unleſs, indeed, it was a ghoſt, or ſo; but now, ſome of them are for hiding down in the vaults under the caſtle; but you muſt not tell the Signor this, ma'amſelle, and I overheard two of them talking—Holy Mother! what makes you look ſo ſad, ma'amſelle? You don't hear what I ſay!"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, I do, Annette! pray proceed."</p>
                     <p>"Well, ma'amſelle, all the caſtle is in ſuch hurly burly.—Some of the men are loading the cannon, and ſome are examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great gates, and the walls all round, and are hammering and patching up, juſt as if all thoſe repairs had never been made, that were ſo long about. But what is to become of me and you, ma'amſelle, and Ludovico? O! when I hear the ſound of the cannon, I ſhall die with fright. If I could but catch the great gate open for one minute, I would be even with it for ſhutting me within theſe walls ſo long!—it ſhould never ſee me again."</p>
                     <p>Emily caught the latter words of Annette. "O! if you could find it open, but for one moment!" ſhe exclaimed, "my peace might yet be ſaved!" The heavy groan ſhe uttered, and the wildneſs of her look, terrified Annette, ſtill more than her words; who entreated Emily to explain the meaning of them, to whom it ſuddenly occurred, that Ludovico might be of ſome ſervice, if there ſhould be a poſſibility of eſcape, and who repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſubſtance of what had paſſed between Montoni and herſelf, but conjured her to mention this to no perſon except to Ludovico. "It may, perhaps, be in his power," ſhe added, "to effect our eſcape. Go to him, Annette, tell him what I have to apprehend, and what I have already ſuffered; but entreat him to be ſecret, and to loſe no time in attempting to releaſe us. If he is willing to undertake this he ſhall be amply rewarded. I cannot ſpeak with him myſelf, for we might be obſerved, and then effectual care would be taken to prevent our flight. But be quick, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette, and, above all be diſcreet—I will await your return in this apartment."</p>
                     <p>The girl, whoſe honeſt heart had been much affected by the recital, was now as eager to obey, as Emily was to employ her, and ſhe immediately quitted the room.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="180" facs="unknown:029378_0204_0FE0841A347DB6B0"/>
Emily's ſurpriſe increaſed, as ſhe reflected upon Annette's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence. "Alas!" ſaid ſhe, "what can the officers of juſtice do againſt an armed caſtle? theſe cannot be ſuch." Upon further conſideration, however, ſhe concluded, that, Montoni's bands having plundered the country round, the inhabitants had taken arms, and were coming with the officers of police and a party of ſoldiers, to force their way into the caſtle. "But they know not," thought ſhe, "its ſtrength, or the armed numbers within it. Alas! except from flight, I have nothing to hope!"</p>
                     <p>Montoni, though not preciſely what Emily apprehended him to be—a captain of banditti—had employed his troops in enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes not leſs daring, or leſs atrocious, than ſuch a character would have undertaken. They had not only pillaged, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever opportunity offered, the helpleſs traveller, but had attacked, and plundered the villas of ſeveral perſons, which, being ſituated among the ſolitary receſſes of the mountains, were totally unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for reſiſtance. In theſe expeditions the commanders of the party did not appear, and the men, partly diſguiſed, had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times been miſtaken for common robbers, and, at others, for bands of the foreign enemy, who, at that period, invaded the country. But, though they had already pillaged ſeveral manſions, and brought home conſiderable treaſures, they had ventured to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach only one caſtle, in the attack of which they were aſſiſted by other troops of their own order; from this, however, they were vigorouſly repulſed, and purſued by ſome of the foreign enemy, who were in league with the beſieged. Montoni's troops fled precipitately towards Udolpho, but were ſo cloſely tracked over the mountains, that, when they reached one of the heights in the neighbourhood of the caſtle, and looked back upon the road, they perceived the enemy winding among the cliffs below, and at not more than a league diſtant. Upon this diſcovery, they haſtened forward with increaſed ſpeed, to prepare Montoni for the enemy; and it was their arrival, which had thrown the caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle into ſuch confuſion and tumult.</p>
                     <p>As Emily awaited anxiouſly ſome information from below, ſhe now ſaw from her caſements a body of troops pour over the neighbouring heights; and, though Annette had been gone a a very ſhort time, and had a difficult and dangerous buſineſs to accompliſh, her impatience for intelligence became painful: ſhe liſtened; opened her door; and often went out upon the corri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor to meet her.</p>
                     <p>At length, ſhe heard a footſtep approach her chamber; and, on opening the door, ſaw, not Annette, but old Carlo! New
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:029378_0204_0FE0841A347DB6B0"/>
fears ruſhed upon her mind. He ſaid he came from the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, who had ordered him to inform her, that ſhe muſt be ready to depart from Udolpho immediately, for that the caſtle was about to be beſieged; and that mules were preparing to convey her, with her guides, to a place of ſafety.</p>
                     <p>"Of ſafety!" exclaimed Emily, thoughtleſsly; "has, then, the Signor ſo much conſideration for me?"</p>
                     <p>Carlo looked upon the ground, and made no reply. A thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand oppoſite emotions agitated Emily, ſucceſſively, as ſhe liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to old Carlo; thoſe of joy, grief, diſtruſt and apprehenſion, appeared, and vaniſhed from her mind, with the quickneſs of lightning. One moment, it ſeemed impoſſible, that Montoni could take this meaſure merely for her preſervation; and ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrange was his ſending her from the caſtle at all, that ſhe could attribute it only to the deſign of carrying into execution the new ſcheme of vengeance, with which he had menaced her. In the next inſtant, it appeared ſo deſirable to quit the caſtle, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any circumſtances, that ſhe could not but rejoice in the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, believing that change muſt be for the better, till ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered the probability of Valancourt being detained in it, when ſorrow and regret uſurped her mind, and ſhe wiſhed, much more fervently than ſhe had yet done, that it might not be his voice which ſhe had heard.</p>
                     <p>Carlo having reminded her, that ſhe had no time to loſe, for that the enemy were within ſight of the caſtle, Emily entreated him to inform her whither ſhe was to go; and, after ſome heſitation, he ſaid he had received no orders to tell; but, on her repeating the queſtion, replied, that he believed ſhe was to be carried into Tuſcany.</p>
                     <p>"To Tuſcany!" exclaimed Emily—"and why thither?"</p>
                     <p>Carlo anſwered, that he knew nothing further, than that ſhe was to be lodged in a cottage on the borders of Tuſcany, at the feet of the Apennines—"Not a day's journey diſtant," ſaid he.</p>
                     <p>Emily now diſmiſſed him; and, with trembling hands, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared the ſmall package, that ſhe meant to take with her; while ſhe was employed about which Annette returned.</p>
                     <p>"O ma'amſelle!" ſaid ſhe, "nothing can be done! Ludovico ſays the new porter is more watchful even than Barnardine was, and we might as well throw ourſelves in the way of a dragon, as in his. Ludovico is almoſt as broken hearted as you are, ma'am, on my account, he ſays, and I am ſure I ſhall never live to hear the cannon fire twice!"</p>
                     <p>She now began to weep, but revived upon hearing of what had juſt occurred, and entreated Emily to take her with her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="182" facs="unknown:029378_0205_0FE08425950247D8"/>
"That I will do moſt willingly," replied Emily, "if Signo Montoni permits it;" to which Annette made no reply, but ran out of the room, and immediately ſought Montoni, who was on the terrace, ſurrounded by his officers, where ſhe began her pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition. He ſharply bade her go into the caſtle, and abſolutely refuſed her requeſt. Annette, however, not only pleaded for herſelf, but for Ludovico; and Montoni had ordered ſome of his men to take her from his preſence, before ſhe would retire.</p>
                     <p>In an agony of diſappointment, ſhe returned to Emily, who foreboded little good towards herſelf, from this refuſal to Annette, and who, ſoon after, received a ſummons to repair to the great court, where the mules, with their guides, were in waiting.—Emily here tried in vain to ſooth the weeping Annette, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in ſaying, that ſhe ſhould never ſee her dear young lady again; a fear, which her miſtreſs ſecretly thought too well juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but which ſhe endeavoured to reſtrain, while, with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent compoſure, ſhe bade this affectionate ſervant farewel.—Annette, however, followed to the courts, which were now thronged with people, buſy in preparation for the enemy; and, having ſeen her mount her mule and depart, with her attendants, through the portal, turned into the caſtle and wept again.</p>
                     <p>Emily, meanwhile, as ſhe looked back upon the gloomy courts of the caſtle, no longer ſilent as when ſhe had firſt entered them, but reſounding with the noiſe of preparation for their defence, as well as crowded with ſoldiers and workmen, hurrying to and fro; and, when ſhe paſſed once more under the huge portcullis, which had formerly ſtruck her with terror and diſmay; and, looking round, ſaw no walls to confine her ſteps—felt, in ſpite of anticipation, the ſudden joy of a priſoner, who unexpectedly finds himſelf at liberty. This emotion would not ſuffer her now to look impartially on the dangers that awaited her without; on mountains infeſted by hoſtile parties, who ſeized every op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for plunder; and on a journey commenced under the guidance of men, whoſe countenances certainly did not ſpeak fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably of their diſpoſitions. In the preſent moments, ſhe could only rejoice, that ſhe was liberated from thoſe walls, which ſhe had entered with ſuch diſmal forebodings; and, remembering the ſuperſtitious preſentiment, which had then ſeized her, ſhe could now ſmile at the impreſſion it had made upon her mind.</p>
                     <p>As ſhe gazed, with theſe emotions, upon the turrets of the caſtle, riſing high over the woods, among which ſhe wound, the ſtranger, whom ſhe believed to be confined there, returned to her remembrance, and anxiety and apprehenſion, leſt he ſhould be

Valancourt, again paſſed like a cloud upon her joy. She recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected every circumſtance, concerning this unknown perſon, ſince the night, when ſhe had firſt heard him play the ſong of her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive province;—circumſtances, which ſhe had ſo often recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and compared before, without extracting from them any thing like conviction, and which ſtill only prompted her to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that Valancourt was a priſoner at Udolpho. It was poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, however, that the men, who were her conductors, might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford her information, on this ſubject; but, fearing to queſtion them immediately, leſt they ſhould be unwilling to diſcover any circumſtance to her in the preſence of each other, ſhe watched for an opportunity of ſpeaking with them ſeparately.</p>
                     <p>Soon after, a trumpet echoed faintly from a diſtance; the guides ſtopped, and looked toward the quarter whence it came, but the thick woods, which ſurrounded them, excluding all view of the country beyond, one of the men rod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> on to the point of an eminence, that afforded a more extenſive proſpect, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve how near the enemy, whoſe trumpet he gueſſed this to be, were advanced; the other, meanwhile, remained with Emily, and to him ſhe put ſome queſtions, concerning the ſtranger at Udolpho. Ugo, for this was his name, ſaid, that there were ſeveral priſoners in the caſtle, but he neither recollected their perſons, or the preciſe time of their arrival, and could therefore give her no information. There was a ſurlineſs in his manner, as he ſpoke, that made it probable he would not have ſatisfied her inquiries, even if he could have done ſo.</p>
                     <p>Having aſked him what priſoners had been taken, about the time, as nearly as ſhe could remember, when ſhe had firſt heard the muſic, "All that week," ſaid, Ugo, 'I was out with a party, upon the mountains, and knew nothing of what was do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the caſtle. We had enough upon our hands, we had warm work of it.'</p>
                     <p>Bertrand, the other man, being now returned, Emily inquired no further, and when he had related to his companion, what he had ſeen, they travelled on in deep ſilence; while Emily often caught, between the opening woods, partial glimpſes of the caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle above—the weſt towers, whoſe battlements were now crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with archers, and the ramparts below, where ſoldiers were ſeen hurrying along, or buſy upon the walls, preparing the cannon.</p>
                     <p>Having emerged from the woods, they wound along the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley in an oppoſite direction to that, from whence the enemy were approaching. Emily had now a full view of Udolpho, with its gray walls, towers and terraces, high over topping the precipices
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:029378_0206_0FE0842A2754C190"/>
and the dark woods, and glittering partially with the arms of the <hi>condottieri,</hi> as the ſun's rays, ſtreaming through an autumnal cloud, glanced upon a part of the edifice, whoſe remaining fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſtood in darkened majeſty. She continued to gaze, through her tears, upon walls that, perhaps, confined Valancourt, and which now, as the cloud floated away, were lighted up with ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſplendour, and then, as ſuddenly were ſhrouded in gloom; while the paſſing gleam fell on the wood tops below, and height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened the firſt tints of autumn, that had begun to ſteal upon the foliage. The winding mountains, at length, ſhut Udolpho from her view, and ſhe turned, with mournful reluctance, to other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. The melancholy ſighing of the wind among the pines, that waved high over the ſteeps, and the diſtant thunder of a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent aſſiſted her muſings, and conſpired with the wild ſcenery around, to diffuſe over her mind emotions ſolemn, yet not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing, but which were ſoon interrupted by the diſtant roar of cannon, echoing among the mountains. The ſounds rolled along the wind, and were repeated in faint and fainter reverberation, till they ſunk in ſullen murmurs. This was a ſignal, that the enemy had reached the caſtle, and fear for Valancourt again tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented Emily. She turned her anxious eyes towards that part of the country, where the edifice ſtood, but the intervening heights concealed it from her view; ſtill, however, ſhe ſaw the tall head of a mountain, which immediately fronted her late chamber, and on this ſhe fixed her gaze, as if it could have told her of all that was paſſing in the ſcene it overlooked. The guides twice reminded her, that ſhe was loſing time and that they had far to go, before ſhe could turn from this intereſting object, and, even when ſhe again moved onward, ſhe often ſent a look back, till only its blue point, brightening in a gleam of ſunſhine, appeared peeping over other mountains.</p>
                     <p>The ſound of the cannon affected Ugo, as the blaſt of the trumpet does the war horſe; it called forth all the fire of his nature; he was impatient to be in the midſt of the fight, and uttered frequent execrations againſt Montoni for having ſent him to a diſtance. The feelings of his comrade ſeemed to be very oppoſite, and adapted rather to the cruelties, than to the dangers of war.</p>
                     <p>Emily aſked frequent queſtions, concerning the place of her deſtination, but could only learn, that ſhe was going to a cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in Tuſcany; and, whenever ſhe mentioned the ſubject, ſhe fancied ſhe perceived, in the countenances of theſe men, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of malice and cunning, that alarmed her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="185" facs="unknown:029378_0206_0FE0842A2754C190"/>
It was afternoon, when they had left the caſtle. During ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral hours, they travelled through regions of profound ſolitude, where no bleat of ſheep, or bark of watch dog, broke on ſilence, and they were now too far off to hear even the faint thunder of the cannon. Towards evening, they wound down precipices, black with foreſts of cypreſs, pine and cedar, into a glen ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage and ſecluded, that, if Solitude ever had local habitation, this might have been "her place of deareſt reſidence." To Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it appeared a ſpot exactly ſuited for the retreat of banditti, and, in her imagination, ſhe already ſaw them lurking under the brow of ſome projecting rock, whence their ſhadows, length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by the ſetting ſun, ſtretched acroſs the road, and warned the traveller of his danger. She ſhuddered at the idea, and, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at her conductors, to obſerve whether they were armed, thought ſhe ſaw in them the banditti ſhe dreaded!</p>
                     <p>It was in this glen, that they propoſed to alight, "For," ſaid Ugo, "night will come on preſently, and then the wolves will make it dangerous to ſtop." This was a new ſubject of alarm to Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but inferior to what ſhe ſuffered from the thought of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left in theſe wilds, at midnight, with two ſuch men as her preſent conductors. Dark and dreadful hints of what might be Montoni's purpoſe in ſending her hither, came to her mind. She endeavoured to diſſuade the men from ſtopping, and inquired with anxiety, how far they had yet to go.</p>
                     <p>"Many leagues yet," replied Bertrand. "As for you, Signo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, you may do as you pleaſe about eating, but for us, we will make a hearty ſupper, while we car. We ſhall have need of it, I warrant, before we finiſh our journey. The ſun's going down apace; let us alight under that rock, yonder."</p>
                     <p>His comrade aſſented, and, turning the mules out of the road, they advanced towards a cliff, overhung with cedars, Emily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in trembling ſilence. They lifted her from her mule, and, having ſeated themſelves on the graſs, at the foot of the rocks, drew ſome homely fare from a wallet, of which Emily tried to eat a little, the better to diſguiſe her apprehenſions.</p>
                     <p>The ſun was now ſunk behind the high mountains in the weſt, upon which a purple haze began to ſpread, and the gloom of twilight to draw over the ſurrounding objects. To the low and ſullen murmur of the breeze, paſſing among the woods, ſhe no longer liſtened with any degree of pleaſure, for it conſpired with the wildneſs of the ſcene and the evening hour, to depreſs her ſpirits.</p>
                     <p>Suſpenſe had ſo much increaſed her anxiety, as to the priſoner at Udolpho, that, finding it impracticable to ſpeak alone with
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:029378_0207_0FE08437B7477D40"/>
Bertrand, on that ſubject, ſhe renewed her queſtions in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Ugo; but he either was, or pretended to be, entirely ignorant, concerning the ſtranger. When he had diſmiſſed the queſtion, he talked with Ugo on ſome ſubject, which led to the mention of Signor Orſino and of the affair that had baniſhed him from Venice; reſpecting which Emily had ventured to aſk a few queſtions.—Ugo appeared to be well acquainted with the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ances of that tragical event, and related ſome minute particulars, that both ſhocked and ſurpriſed her; for it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very extraordinary how ſuch particulars could be known to any, but to perſons preſent when the aſſaſſination was committed.</p>
                     <p>"He was of rank," ſaid Bertrand, "or the State would not have troubled itſelf to inquire after his aſſaſſins. The Signor has been lucky hitherto; this is not the firſt affair of the kind he has had upon his hands; and to be ſure, when a gentleman has no other way of getting redreſs—why he muſt take this."</p>
                     <p>"Aye," ſaid Ugo, "and why is not this as good as another? This is the way to have juſtice done at once, without more ado. If you go to law, you muſt ſtay till the judges pleaſe, and may loſe your cauſe at laſt. Why the beſt way, then, is to make ſure of your right, while you can, and execute juſtice yourſelf."</p>
                     <p>"Yes, yes," rejoined Bertrand, "if you wait till juſtice is done you—you may ſtay long enough. Why if I want a friend of mine properly ſerved, how am I to get my revenge? Ten to one they will tell me he is in the right, and I am in the wrong. Or, if a fellow has got poſſeſſion of property which I think ought to be mine, why I may wait, till I ſtarve, perhaps, before the law will give it me, and then, after all, the judge may ſay—the eſtate is his. What is to be done then?—Why the caſe is plain enough, I muſt take it at laſt."</p>
                     <p>Emily's horror at this converſation was heightened by a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion, that the latter part of it was pointed againſt herſelf, and that theſe men had been commiſſioned by Montoni to execute a ſimilar kind of <hi>juſtice,</hi> in his cauſe.</p>
                     <p>"But I was ſpeaking of Signor Orſino," reſumed Bertrand, "he is one of thoſe who love to do juſtice at once. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber about ten years ago, the Signor had a quarrel with a cavali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ero of Milan. The ſtory was told me then, and it is ſtill freſh in my head. They quarrelled about a lady, that the Signor liked, and ſhe was perverſe enough to prefer the gentleman of Milan, and even carried her whim ſo far as to marry him. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the Signor, as well it might, for he had tried to talk reaſon to her a long while, and uſed to ſend people to ſerenade her, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:029378_0207_0FE08437B7477D40"/>
her windows of a night; and uſed to make verſes about her, and would ſwear ſhe was the handſomeſt lady in Milan—But all would not do—nothing would bring her to reaſon; and, as I ſaid, ſhe went ſo far at laſt, as to marry this other cavaliero. This made the Signor wrath, with a vengeance; he reſolved to be even with her though, and he watched his opportunity, and did not wait long, for, ſoon after the marriage, they ſet out for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dua, nothing doubting, I warrant, of what was preparing for them. The cavaliero thought, to be ſure, he was to be called to no account, but was to go off triumphant; but he was ſoon made to know another ſort of ſtory."</p>
                     <p>"What then, the lady had promiſed to have Signor Orſino?" ſaid Ugo.</p>
                     <p>"Promiſed! No," replied Bertrand, "ſhe had not wit enough even to tell him ſhe liked him, as I heard, but the contrary, for ſhe uſed to ſay, from the firſt, ſhe never meant to have him. And this was what provoked the Signor, ſo, and with good reaſon, for, who likes to be told that he is diſagreeable? and this was ſaying as good. It was enough to tell him this; ſhe need not have gone and married another."</p>
                     <p>"What, ſhe married, then, on purpoſe to plague the Signor?" ſaid Ugo.</p>
                     <p>"I don't know as for that," replied Bertrand, "they ſaid, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that ſhe had had a regard for the other gentleman a great while; but that is nothing to the purpoſe, ſhe ſhould not have married him, and then the Signor would not have been ſo much provoked. She might have expected what was to follow; it was not to be ſuppoſed he would bear her ill uſage tamely, and ſhe might thank herſelf for what happened. But, as I ſaid, they ſet out for Padua, ſhe and her huſband, and the road lay over ſome barren mountains like theſe. This ſuited the Signor's purpoſe well. He watched the time of their departure, and ſent his men after them with directions what to do. They kept their diſtance till they ſaw their opportunity, and this did not happen till the ſecond day's journey, when, the gentleman having ſent his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants forward to the next town, may be to have horſes in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Signor's men quickened their pace, and overtook the carriage, in a hollow, between two mountains, where the woods prevented the ſervants from ſeeing what paſſed, though they were then not far off. When we came up, we fired our tromboni, but miſſed."</p>
                     <p>Emily turned pale, at theſe words, and then hoped ſhe had miſtaken them; while Bertrand proceeded:</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="188" facs="unknown:029378_0208_0FE0843C97D3C310"/>
"The gentleman fired again, but he was ſoon made to allight and it was as he turned to call his people, that he was ſtruck. It was the moſt dexterous feat you ever ſaw—he was ſtruck in the back with three ſtillettos at once. He fell, and was diſpatched in a minute; but the lady eſcaped, for the ſervants had heard the ſiring, and came up before ſhe could be taken care of. 'Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trand,' ſaid the Signor, when his men returned"—</p>
                     <p>"Bertrand!" exclaimed Emily, pale with horror, on whom not a ſyllable of this narrative had been loſt.</p>
                     <p>"Bertrand, did I ſay?" rejoined the man, with ſome confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion—"No, Giovanni. But I have forgot where I was;—'Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trand,' ſaid the Signor"—</p>
                     <p>"Bertrand, again!" ſaid Emily, in a faltering voice, "Why do you repeat that name?"</p>
                     <p>Bertrand ſwore. "What ſignifies it," he proceeded "what the man was called—Bertrand, or Giovanni—or Roberto? it's all one for that. You have put me out twice with that—queſtion. 'Bertrand,' or Giovanni—or what you will—'Bertrand,' ſaid the Signor, 'if your comrades had done their duty, as well as you, I ſhould not have loſt the lady. Go, my honeſt fellow, and be happy with this.' He gave him a purſe of gold—and little enough too, conſidering the ſervice he had done him."</p>
                     <p>"Aye, aye," ſaid Ugo, "little enough—little enough."</p>
                     <p>Emily now breathed with difficulty, and could ſcarcely ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port herſelf. When firſt ſhe ſaw theſe men, their appearance, and their connection with Montoni had been ſufficient to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs her with diſtruſt; but now, when one of them had betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf to be a murderer, and ſhe ſaw herſelf, at the approach of night, under his guidance, among wild and ſolitary moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and going ſhe ſcarcely knew whither, the moſt agonizing terror ſeized her, which was the leſs ſupportable from the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity ſhe found herſelf under of concealing all ſymptons of it from her companions. Reflecting on the character and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces of Montoni, it appeared not improbable, that he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered her to them, for the purpoſe of having her murdered, and of thus ſecuring to himſelf, without further oppoſition or delay, the eſtates, for which he had ſo long and ſo deſperately contended. Yet, if this was his deſign, there appeared no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity for ſending her to ſuch a diſtance from the caſtle; for, if any dread of diſcovery had made him unwilling to perpetrate the deed there, a much nearer place might have ſufficed for the purpoſe of concealment. Theſe conſiderations, however, did not immediately occur to Emily, with whom ſo many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:029378_0208_0FE0843C97D3C310"/>
conſpired to rouſe terror, that ſhe had no power to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, or to inquire cooly into its grounds; and, if ſhe had done ſo, ſtill there were many appearances which would too well have juſtified her moſt terrible apprehenſions. She did not now dare to ſpeak to her conductors, at the ſound of whoſe voices ſhe trembled; and when, now and then, ſhe ſtole a glance at them, their countenances, ſeen imperfectly through the gloom of even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſerved to confirm her fears.</p>
                     <p>The ſun had now been ſet ſometime; heavy clouds, whoſe lower ſkirts were tinged with ſulphureous crimſon, lingered in the weſt, and threw a reddiſh tint upon the pine foreſts, which ſent forth a ſolemn ſound, as the breeze rolled over them. The hollow moan ſtruck upon Emily's heart, and ſerved to render more gloomy and terrific every object around her,—the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, ſhaded in twilight—the gleaming torrent, hoarſely roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—the black foreſts, and the deep glen, broken into rocky re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, high overſhadowed by cypreſs and ſycamore and winding into long obſcurity. To this glen, Emily, as ſhe ſent forth her anxious eye, thought there was no end; no hamlet, or even cottage, was ſeen, and ſtill no diſtant bark of watch dog, or even faint, far off halloo came on the wind. In a tremulous voice, ſhe now ventured to remind the guides, that it was growing late, and to aſk again how far they had to go: but they were too much occupied by their own diſcourſe to attend to her queſtion, which ſhe forbore to repeat, leſt it ſhould provoke a ſurly anſwer. Having, however, ſoon after, finiſhed their ſupper, the men collected the fragments into their wallet, and proceeded along this winding glen, in gloomy ſilence; while Emily again muſed upon her own ſituation, and concerning the motives of Montoni for involving her in it. That it was for ſome evil purpoſe towards herſelf, ſhe could not doubt; and it ſeemed, that, if he did not intend to deſtroy her, with a view of immediately ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her eſtates, he meant to reſerve her a while in concealment, for ſome more terrible deſign, for one that might equally gratify his avarice and ſtill more his deep revenge. At this moment, remembering Signor Brochio and his behaviour in the corridor, a few preceding nights, the latter ſuppoſition, horrible as it was, ſtrengthened in her belief. Yet, why remove her from the caſtle, where deeds of darkneſs had, ſhe feared, been often executed with ſecrecy?—from chambers, perhaps
<q>
                           <l>"With many a foul, and midnight murder ſtain'd."</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>

The dread of what ſhe might be going to encounter was now ſo exceſſive, that it ſometimes threatened her ſenſes; and, often as ſhe went, ſhe thought of her late father and of all he would have ſuffered, could he have foreſeen the ſtrange and dreadful events of her future life; and how anxiouſly he would have avoided that fatal confidence, which committed his daughter to the care of a woman ſo weak as was Madame Montoni. So romantic and improbable indeed, did her preſent ſituation appear to Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly herſelf, particularly when ſhe compared it with the repoſe and beauty of her early days, that there were moments, when ſhe could almoſt have believed herſelf the victim of frightful vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, glaring upon a diſordered fancy.</p>
                     <p>Reſtrained by the preſence of her guides from expreſſing her terrors, their acuteneſs was, at length, loſt in gloomy deſpair. The dreadful view of what might await her hereafter rendered her almoſt indifferent to the ſurrounding dangers. She now looked, with little emotion, on the wild dingles, and the gloomy road and mountains, whoſe outlines only were diſtinguiſhable through the duſk;—objects, which but lately had affected her ſpirits ſo much, as to awaken horrid views of the future, and to tinge theſe with their own gloom.</p>
                     <p>It was now ſo nearly dark, that the travellers, who proceeded only by the ſloweſt pace, could ſcarcely diſcern their way. The clouds, which ſeemed charged with thunder, paſſed ſlowly along the heavens, ſhewing, at intervals, the trembling ſtars; while the groves of cypreſs and ſycamore, that overhung the rocks, waved high in the breeze, as it ſwept over the glen, and then ruſhed among the diſtant woods. Emily ſhivered as it paſſed.</p>
                     <p>"Where is the torch?" ſaid Ugo, "It grows dark."</p>
                     <p>"Not ſo dark yet," replied Bertrand, "but we may find our way, and 'tis beſt not light the torch, before we can help, for it may betray us, if any ſtruggling party of the enemy is abroad."</p>
                     <p>Ugo muttered ſomething, which Emily did not underſtand, and they proceeded in darkneſs, while ſhe almoſt wiſhed, that the enemy might diſcover them; for from change there was ſomething to hope, ſince ſhe could ſcarcely imagine any ſituation more dreadful than her preſent one.</p>
                     <p>As they moved ſlowly along, her attention was ſurpriſed by a thin tapering flame, that appeared, by fits, at the point of the pike, which Bertrand carried, reſembling what ſhe had obſerved on the lance of the ſentinel, the night Madame Montoni died, and which he had ſaid was an omen. The event immediately following it appeared to juſtify the aſſertion, and a ſuperſtitious
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:029378_0209_0FE08447C77CB7B0"/>
impreſſion had remained on Emily's mind, which the preſent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance confirmed. She thought it was an omen of her own fate, and watched it ſucceſſively vaniſh and return, in gloomy ſilence, which was at length interrupted by Bertrand.</p>
                     <p>"Let us light the torch," ſaid he, "and get under ſhelter of the woods;—a ſtorm is coming on—look at my lance."</p>
                     <p>He held it forth, with the flame tapering at its point<note n="*" place="bottom">See <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"Aye," ſaid Ugo, "you are not one of thoſe, that believe in omens: we have left cowards at the caſtle, who would turn pale at ſuch a ſight, I have often ſeen it before a thunder ſtorm, it is an omen of that, and one is coming now, ſure enough. The clouds flaſh faſt already."</p>
                     <p>Emily was relieved by this converſation from ſome of the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of ſuperſtition, but thoſe of reaſon increaſed, as, waiting while Ugo ſearched for a flint, to ſtrike fire, ſhe watched the pale lightning gleam over the woods they were about to enter, and illuminate the harſh countenances of her companions. Ugo could not find a flint, and Bertrand became impatient, for the thunder ſounded hollowly at a diſtance, and the lightning was more frequent. Sometimes, it revealed the nearer receſſes of the woods, or, diſplaying ſome opening in their ſummits, illuminated the ground beneath with partial ſplendour, the thick foliage of the trees preſerving the ſurrounding ſcene in deep ſhadow.</p>
                     <p>At length, Ugo found a flint, and the torch was lighted. The men then diſmounted, and, having aſſiſted Emily, led the mules towards the woods, that ſkirted the glen, on the left, over broken ground, frequently interrupted with bruſh-wood and wild plants, which ſhe was often obliged to make a circuit to avoid.</p>
                     <p>She could not approach theſe woods, without experiencing keener ſenſe of her danger. Their deep ſilence, except when the wind ſwept among their branches, and impenetrable glooms ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

To her affrighted fancy it occurred, that they were leading her into theſe woods to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the will of Montoni by her murder. The horrid ſuggeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion called a groan from her heart, which ſurpriſed her compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, who turned round quickly towards her, and ſhe demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:029378_0210_0FE0844D62933A10"/>
why they led her thither, beſeeching them to continue their way along the open glen, which ſhe repreſented to be leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous than the woods, in a thunder ſtorm.</p>
                     <p>"No, no," ſaid Bertrand, "we know beſt where the danger lies. See how the clouds open over our heads. Beſides, we can glide under cover of the woods with leſs hazard of being ſeen, ſhould any of the enemy be wandering this way. By holy St. Peter and all the reſt of them, I've as ſtout a heart as the beſt, as many a poor devil could tell, if he were alive again—but what can we do againſt numbers?"</p>
                     <p>"What are you whining about?" ſaid Ugo, contemptuouſly, "who fears numbers! Let them come, though they were as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as the Signor's caſtle could hold; I would ſhew the knaves what fighting is. For you—I would lay you quietly in a dry ditch, were you might peep out, and ſee me put the rogues to flight.—Who talks of fear!"</p>
                     <p>Bertrand replied, with an horrible oath, that he did not like ſuch jeſting, and a violent altercation enſued, which was, at length ſilenced by the thunder, whoſe deep volley was heard afar, rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling onward till it burſt over their heads in ſounds, that ſeemed to ſhake the earth to its centre. The ruffians pauſed, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon each other. Between the boles of the trees, the blue lightning flaſhed and quivered along the ground, while, as Emily looked under the boughs, the mountains beyond frequently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be clothed in livid flame. At this moment, perhaps, ſhe felt leſs fear of the ſtorm, than did either of her companions, for other terrors occupied her mind.</p>
                     <p>The men now reſted under an enormous cheſnut tree, and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their pikes in the ground, at ſome diſtance, on the iron points of which Emily repeatedly obſerved the lightning play, and then glide down them into the earth.</p>
                     <p>"I would we were well in the Signor's caſtle!" ſaid Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trand, "I know not why he ſhould ſend us on this buſineſs. Hark I how it rattles above, there! I could almoſt find in my heart to turn prieſt, and pray. Ugo, haſt got a roſary?"</p>
                     <p>"No," replied Ugo, "I leave it to cowards like thee to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry roſaries—I, carry a ſword."</p>
                     <p>"And much good may it do thee in fighting againſt the ſtorm?" ſaid Bertrand.</p>
                     <p>Another peal, which was reverberated in tremenduous echoes among the mountains, ſilenced them for a moment. As it rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led away, Ugo propoſed going on. "We are only loſing time here," ſaid he, "for the thick boughs of the woods will ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter us as well as this cheſnut tree."</p>
                     <p>

They again led the mules forward, between the boles of the trees, and over pathleſs graſs, that concealed their high knotted roots. The riſing wind was now heard contending with the thunder, as it ruſhed furiouſly among the branches above, and brightened the red flame of the torch, which threw a ſtronger light forward among the woods, and ſhewed their gloomy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p>At length, the ſtrength of the wind ſeemed to drive the ſtorm before it, for the thunder rolled away into diſtance, and was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faintly heard. After travelling through the woods for nearly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> hour, during which, the elements ſeemed to have returned to repoſe, the travellers, gradually aſcending from the glen, found themſelves upon the open brow of a mountain, with a wide valley, extending in miſty moonlight, at their feet, and above, the blue ſky, trembling through the few thin clouds, that linger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after the ſtorm, and were ſinking ſlowly to the verge of the horizon.</p>
                     <p>Emily's ſpirits, now that ſhe had quitted the woods, began to revive; for ſhe conſidered, that, if theſe men had received an order to deſtroy her, they would probably have executed their barbarous purpoſe in the ſolitary wild, from whence they had juſt emerged, where the deed would have been ſhrouded from every human eye. Reaſſured by this reflection, and by the quiet demeanour of her guides, Emily, as they proceeded ſilently in a kind of ſheep track, that wound along the ſkirts of the woods, which aſcended on the right, could not ſurvey the ſleeping beauty of the vale, to which they were declining, without a momentary ſenſation of pleaſure. It ſeemed varied with woods, paſtures, and ſloping grounds, and was ſcreened to the north and the eaſt by an amphitheatre of the Apennines, whoſe outline on the horizon was here broken into varied and elegant forms; to the weſt and the ſouth, the landſcape extended indiſtinctly into the lowlands of Tuſcany.</p>
                     <p>"There is the ſea yonder," ſaid Bertrand, as if he had known that Emily was examining the twilight view, "yonder in the weſt, though we cannot ſee it."</p>
                     <p>Emily already perceived a change in the climate, from that of the wild and mountanous tract ſhe had left; and, as ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued deſcending, the air became perfumed by the breath of a thouſand nameleſs flowers among the graſs, called forth by the late rain. So ſoothingly beautiful was the ſcene around her, and ſo ſtrikingly contraſted to the gloomy grandeur of thoſe, to
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:029378_0211_0FE08457E7D48498"/>
which ſhe had long been confined, and to the manners of the people, who moved among them, that ſhe could almoſt have fancied herſelf again at La Vallee, and, wondering why Montoni had ſent her hither, could ſcarcely believe, that he had ſelected ſo enchanting a ſpot for any cruel deſign. It was, however, probably not the ſpot, but the perſons, who happened to inhabit it, and to whoſe care he could ſafely commit the execution of his plans, whatever they might be, that had determined his choice.</p>
                     <p>She now ventured again to inquire, whether they were near the place of their deſtination, and was anſwered by Ugo, that they had not far to go. "Only to the wood of cheſnuts in the valley yonder," ſaid he, "there, by the brook, that ſparkles with the moon; I wiſh I was once at reſt there, with a flaſk of good wine, and a ſlice of Tuſcany bacon."</p>
                     <p>Emily's ſpirits revived, when ſhe heard, that the journey was ſo nearly concluded, and ſaw the wood of cheſnuts in an open part of the vale, on the margin of the ſtream.</p>
                     <p>In a ſhort time, they reached the entrance of the wood, and perceived, between the twinkling leaves, a light, ſtreaming from a diſtant cottage window. They proceeded along the edge of the brook to where the trees, crowding over it, excluded the moonbeams, but a long line of light, from the cottage above, was ſeen on its dark tremulous ſurface. Bertrand now ſtepped on firſt, and Emily heard him knock, and call loudly at the door. As ſhe reached it, the ſmall upper caſement, where the light ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, was uncloſed by a man, who, having inquired what they wanted, immediately deſcended, let them into a neat ruſtic cot, and called up his wife to ſet refreſhments before the travellers. As this man converſed, rather apart, with Bertrand, Emily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiouſly ſurveyed him. He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>as a tall, but not robuſt peaſant, of a ſallow complexion, and had a ſhrewd and cunning eye; his countenance was not of a character to win the ready confidence of youth, and there was nothing in his manner, that might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliate a ſtranger.</p>
                     <p>Ugo called impatiently for ſupper, and in a tone as if he knew his authority here to be unqueſtionable. "I expected you an hour ago," ſaid the peaſant, "for I have had Signor Montoni's letter theſe three hours, and I and my wife had given you up, and gone to bed. How did you fare in the ſtorm?"</p>
                     <p>"Ill enough," replied Ugo, "ill enough, and we are like to fare ill enough here too, unleſs you will make more haſte. Get us more wine, and let us ſee what you have to eat."</p>
                     <p>

The peaſant placed before them all, that his cottage afforded; ham, wine, figs, and grapes of ſuch ſize and flavour, as Emily had ſeldom taſted.</p>
                     <p>After taking refreſhment, ſhe was ſhewn by the peaſant's wife to her little bed-chamber, where ſhe aſked ſome queſtions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Montoni, to which the woman, whoſe name was Dorina, gave reſerved anſwers, pretending ignorance of his <hi>Excellenza's</hi> intention in ſending Emily hither, but acknowledging that her huſband had been apprized of the circumſtance. Perceiving, that ſhe could obtain no intelligence concerning her deſtination, Emily diſmiſſed Dorina, and retired to repoſe; but all the buſy ſcenes of the paſt and the anticipated ones of the future came to her anxious mind, and conſpired with the ſenſe of her new ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to baniſh ſleep.</p>

                     <p>WHEN Emily, in the morning, opened her caſement, ſhe was ſurpriſed to obſerve the beauties, that ſurrounded it. The cottage was nearly embowered in the woods, which were chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of cheſnut, intermixed with ſome cypreſs, larch and ſyca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. Beneath the dark and ſpreading branches, appeared, to the north, and to the eaſt, the woody Apennines, riſing in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtic amphitheatre, not black with pines, as ſhe had been accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to ſee them, but their loftieſt ſummits crowned with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient foreſts of cheſnut, oak, and oriental plane, now animated with the rich tints of atumn, and which ſwept downward to the valley uninterruptedly, except where ſome bold rocky promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory looked out from among the foliage, and caught the paſſing gleam. Vineyards ſtretched along the feet of the mountains, where the elegant villas of the Tuſcan nobility frequently adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:029378_0212_0FE0845D800E4070"/>
the ſcene, and overlooked ſlopes clothed with groves of olive, mulberry, orange and lemon. The plain, to which theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, was coloured with the riches of cultivation, whoſe min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled hues were mellowed into harmony by an Italian ſun. Vines, their purple cluſtres bluſhing between the ruſſet foliage, hung in luxuriant feſtoons from the branches of ſtandard fig and cherry trees, while paſtures of verdure, ſuch as Emily had ſeldom ſeen in Italy, enriched the banks of a ſtream that, after deſcending from the mountains, wound along the landſcape, which it reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to a bay of the ſea. There, far in the weſt, the waters, fad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the ſky, aſſumed a tint of the fainteſt purple, and the line of ſeparation between them was, now and then, diſcernible only by the progreſs of a ſail, brightened with the ſunbeam, along the horizon.</p>
                     <p>The cottage, which was ſhaded by the woods from the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer rays of the ſun, and was open only to his evening light, was covered entirely with vines, fig trees and jeſſamine, whoſe flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſurpaſſed in ſize and fragrance any that Emily had ſeen. Theſe and ripening cluſters of grapes hung round her little caſement. The turf, that grew under the woods, was inlaid with a variety of wild flowers and perfumed herbs, and, on the oppoſite margin of the ſtream, whoſe current diffuſed freſhneſs beneath the ſhades, roſe a grove of lemon and orange trees. This, though nearly oppoſite to Emily's window, did not interrupt her proſpect, but rather heightened, by its dark verdure, the effect of the perſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; and to her this ſpot was a bower of ſweets, whoſe charms communicated imperceptibly to her mind ſomewhat of their own ſerenity.</p>
                     <p>She was ſoon ſummoned to breakfaſt, by the peaſant's daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a girl about ſeventeen, of a pleaſant countenance, which, Emily was glad to obſerve, ſeemed animated with the pure af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of nature, though the others, that ſurrounded her, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, more or leſs, the worſt qualities—cruelty, ferocity, cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and duplicity; of the latter ſtyle of countenance, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, were thoſe of the peaſant and his wife. Maddelina ſpoke little, but what ſhe ſaid was in a ſoft voice, and with an air of modeſty and complacency, that intereſted Emily, who breakfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at a ſeparate table with Dorina, while Ugo and Bertrand were taking a repaſt of Tuſcany bacon and wine with their hoſt, near the cottage door; when they had finiſhed which, Ugo, riſing haſtily, inquired for his mule, and Emily learned that he was to return to Udolpho, while Bertrand remained at the cottage; a circumſtance, which, though it did not ſurpriſe, diſtreſted her.</p>
                     <p>

When Ugo was departed, Emily propoſed to walk in the neighbouring woods; but, on being told, that ſhe muſt not quit the cottage, without having Bertrand for her attendant, ſhe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew to her own room. There, as her eyes ſettled on the tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering Apennines, ſhe recollected the terrific ſcenery they had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited and the horrors ſhe had ſuffered, on the preceding night, particularly at the moment when Bertrand had betrayed himſelf to be an aſſaſſin; and theſe remembrances awakened a train of images, which, ſince they abſtracted her from a conſideration of her own ſituation, ſhe purſued for ſometime, and then arranged in the following lines; pleaſed to have diſcovered any innocent means, by which ſhe could beguile an hour of misfortune.</p>

                     <p>Preferring the ſolitude of her room to the company of the perſons below ſtairs, Emily dined above, and Maddelina was ſuffered to attend her, from whoſe ſimple converſation ſhe learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:029378_0213_0FE08469D6AE6580"/>
that the peaſant and his wife were old inhabitants of this cottage, which had been purchaſed for them by Montoni, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of ſome ſervice, rendered him, many years before, by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, to whom Carlo, the ſteward at the caſtle, was nearly related. "So many years ago, Signora," added Maddelina, "that I know nothing about it; but my father did the Signor a great good, for my mother has often ſaid to him, this cottage was the leaſt he ought to have had."</p>
                     <p>To the mention of this circumſtance Emily liſtened with a painful intereſt, ſince it appeared to give a frightful colour to the character of Marco, whoſe ſervice, thus rewarded by Montoni, ſhe could ſcarcely doubt had been criminal; and, if ſo, had too much reaſon to believe, that ſhe had been committed into his hands for ſome deſperate purpoſe. "Did you ever hear how many years it is," ſaid Emily, who was conſidering of Signora Laurentini's diſappearance from Udolpho, "ſince your father performed the ſervices you ſpoke of?"</p>
                     <p>"It was a little before he came to live at the cottage, Signo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra," replied Maddelina, "and that is about eighteen years ago."</p>
                     <p>This was near the period, when Signora Laurentini had been ſaid to diſappear, and it occurred to Emily, that Marco had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in that myſterious affair, and, perhaps, had been employed in a murder! This horrible ſuggeſtion fixed her in ſuch profound reverie, that Maddelina quitted the room, unperceived by her, and ſhe remained unconſcious of all around her, for a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time. Tears, at length, came to her relief, after indulging which, her ſpirits becoming calmer, ſhe ceaſed to tremble at a view of evils, that might never arrive; and had ſufficient reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to endeavour to withdraw her thoughts from the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of her own intereſts. Remembering the few books, which even in the hurry of her departure from Udolpho ſhe had put into her little package, ſhe ſat down with one of them at her pleaſant caſement, whence her eyes often wandered from the page to the landſcape whoſe beauty gradually ſoothed her mind into gentle melancholy.</p>
                     <p>Here, ſhe remained alone, till evening, and ſaw the ſun de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend the weſtern ſky, throw all his pomp of light and ſhadow upon the mountains, and gleam upon the diſtant ocean and the ſtealing ſails, as he ſunk amidſt the waves. Then, at the muſing hour of twilight, her ſoftened thoughts returned to Valancourt; ſhe again recollected every circumſtance, connected with the midnight muſic, and all that might aſſiſt her conjecture, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his impriſonment at the caſtle, and, becoming confirmed

in the ſuppoſition, that it was his voice ſhe had heard there, ſhe looked back to that gloomy abode with emotions of grief and momentary regret.</p>
                     <p>Refreſhed by the cool and fragrant air, and her ſpirits ſoothed to a ſtate of gentle melancholy by the ſtilly murmur of the brook below and of the woods around, ſhe lingered at her caſement long after the ſun had ſet, watching the valley ſinking into ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, till only the grand outline of the ſurrounding mountain ſhadowed upon the horizon, remained viſible. But a clear moonlight, that ſucceeded, gave to the landſcape, what time gives to the ſcenes of paſt life, when it ſoftens all their harſher features, and throws over the whole the mellowing ſhade of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant contemplation. The ſcenes of La Vallee, in the early morn of her life, when ſhe was protected and beloved by parents equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loved, appeared in Emily's memory tenderly beautiful, like the proſpect before her, and awakened mournful compariſons. Unwilling to encounter the coarſe behaviour of the peaſant's wife, ſhe remained ſupperleſs in her room, while ſhe wept again over her forlorn and perilous ſituation, a review of which entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Wearied with weeping, ſhe, at length, lay down on her mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſs, and ſunk to ſleep, but was ſoon awakened by a knocking at her chamber door, and ſtarting up in terror, ſhe heard a voice calling her. The image of Bertrand, with a ſtilletto in his hand appeared to her alarmed fancy, and ſhe neither opened the door, or anſwered, but liſtened in profound ſilence, till the voice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating her name in the ſame low tone, ſhe demanded who cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. "It is I Signora," replied the voice, which ſhe now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed to be Maddelina's, "pray open the door. Don't be frightened, it is I."</p>
                     <p>"And what brings you here ſo late, Maddelina?" ſaid Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as ſhe let her in. "Huſh! Signora, for heaven's ſake huſh, if we are overheard I ſhall never be forgiven. My father and mother and Bertrand are all gone to bed," continued Maddeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, as ſhe gently ſhut the door, and crept forward, "and I have brought you ſome ſupper, for you had none, you know, Signo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, below ſtairs. Here are ſome grapes and figs and half a cup of wine." Emily thanked her, but expreſſed apprehenſion leſt this kindneſs ſhould draw upon her the reſentment of Dorina, when ſhe perceived the fruit was gone. "Take it back, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,

Maddelina," added Emily, "I ſhall ſuffer much leſs from the want of it, than I ſhould do, if this act of good nature was to ſubject you to your mother's diſpleaſure."</p>
                     <p>"O Signora! there is no danger of that," replied Maddeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, "my mother cannot miſs the fruit, for I ſaved it from my own ſupper. You will make me very unhappy, if you refuſe to take <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Emily, ſmiling through her tears, told Maddelina, that ſhe was a good girl, and then accepted her offering. She wiſhed anxiouſly to know, whether Bertrand and Dorina had ſpoken of Montoni, or of his deſigns, concerning herſelf, in the preſence of Maddelina, but diſdained to tempt the innocent girl to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct ſo mean, as that of betraying the private converſation of her parents.

                        </gap> ſeveral days paſſed, during which Emily remained in her own room, Maddelina attending her only at her repaſt, whoſe gentle countenance and manners ſoothed her more than any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance ſhe had known for many months. Of her pleaſant embowered chamber ſhe now became fond, and began to expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in it thoſe feelings of ſecurity, which we naturally at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatch to home. In this interval alſo, her mind, having been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturbed by any new circumſtance of diſguſt, or alarm, recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Imagination drew, ſhe would forget, for a moment, her real ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. Thus innocently ſhe beguiled the heavy hours of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, and, with meek patience, awaited the events of futurity.</p>
                     <p>A beautiful evening that had ſucceeded to a ſultry day, at length induced Emily to walk, though ſhe knew that Bertrand muſt attend her, and, with Maddelina for her companion, ſhe left the cottage, followed by Bertrand, who allowed her to chooſe her own way. The hour was cool and ſilent, and ſhe could not look upon the country around her, without delight. How love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, too, appeared the brilliant blue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> coloured all the upper region of the air, and, thence fading downward, was loſt in the ſaffron glow of the horizon! Nor leſs ſo were the varied ſhades and warm colouring of the Apennines, as the evening ſun threw his ſlanting rays athwart their broken ſurface. Emily followed the courſe of the ſtream, under the ſhades, that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hung its graſſy margin. On the oppoſite banks, the paſtures were animated with herds of cattle of a beautiful cream colour; and, beyond, were groves of lemon and orange, with fruit glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the branches, frequent almoſt as the leaves, which partly concealed it. She purſued her way towards the ſea, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected the warm glow of ſunſet, while the cliffs, that roſe over its edge, were tinted with the laſt rays. The valley was ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated on the right by a lofty promontory, whoſe ſummit, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending over the waves, was crowned with a ruined tower, now ſerving for the purpoſe of a beacon, whoſe ſhattered battlements and the extended wing of ſome ſea fowl, that circled near it, were ſtill illumined by the upward beams of the ſun, though his diſk was now ſunk beneath the horizon; while the lower part of the ruin, the cliff on which it ſtood and the waves as its foot, were ſhaded with the firſt tints of twilight.</p>
                     <p>Having reached this headland, Emily gazed with ſolemn pleaſure on the cliffs, that extended on either hand along the ſequeſtered ſhores, ſome crowned with groves of pine, and others exhibiting only barren precipices of a grayiſh marble, except where the crags were tufted with myrtle and other aromatic ſhrubs. The ſea ſlept in a perfect calm; its waves, dying in murmurs on the ſhores, flowed with the gentleſt undulation, while its clear ſurface reflected in ſoftened beauty the vermeil tints of the weſt. Emily, as ſhe looked upon the ocean, thought of France and of paſt times, and ſhe wiſhed, Oh! how ardently, and vainly—wiſhed! that its waves would bear her to her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, native home!</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="202" facs="unknown:029378_0215_0FE0847E4D21B990"/>
"Ah! that veſſel," ſaid ſhe, "that veſſel, which glides along ſo ſtately, with its tall ſails reflected in the water, is, perhaps, bound for France! Happy—happy bark!" She continued to gaze upon it, with warm emotion, till the gray of twilight ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured the diſtance, and veiled it from her view. The melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly ſound of the waves at her feet aſſiſted the tenderneſs, that occaſioned her tears, and this was the only ſound, that broke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hour, till, having followed the windings of the beach, for ſometime, a chorus of voices paſſed her on the air. She pauſed a moment, wiſhing to hear more, yet fearing to be ſeen, and, for the firſt time, looked back to Bertrand, as her protector, who was following, at a ſhort diſtance, in company with ſome other perſon. Reaſſured by this circumſtance, ſhe advanced towards the ſounds, which ſeemed to ariſe from behind a high promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, that projected athwart the beach. There was now a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den pauſe in the muſic, and then one female voice was heard to ſing in a kind of chant. Emily quickened her ſteps, and, wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round the rock, ſaw, within the ſweeping bay, beyond, which was hung with woods from the borders of the beach to the very ſummit of the cliffs, two groups of peaſants, one ſeated beneath the ſhades, and the other ſtanding on the edge of the ſea, round the girl, who was ſinging, and who held in her hand a chaplet of flowers, which ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Emily, liſtening with ſurpriſe and attention, diſtinguiſhed the following invocation delivered in the pure and elegant tongue of Tuſcany and accompanied by a few paſtoral inſtruments.</p>

The laſt words being repeated by the ſurrounding group, the garland of flowers was thrown into the waves, and the chorus, ſinking gradually into a chant, died away in ſilence.</p>
                     <p>"What can this mean, Maddelina!" ſaid Emily, awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the pleaſing trance, into which the muſic had lulled her. "This is the eve of a feſtival, Signora," replied Madde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina; "and the peaſants then amuſe themſelves with all kinds of ſports."</p>
                     <p>"But they talked of a ſea-nymph," ſaid Emily: "how came theſe good people to think of a ſea-nymph?"</p>
                     <p>"O, Signora," rejoined Maddelina, miſtaking the reaſon of Emily's ſurpriſe, "nobody <hi>believes</hi> in ſuch things, but our old ſongs tell of them, and, when we are at our ſports, we ſometimes ſing to them and throw garlands into the ſea."</p>
                     <p>Emily had been early taught to venerate Florence as the ſeat of literature and of the fine arts; but, that its taſte for claſſic ſtory ſhould deſcend to the peaſants of the country, occaſioned her both ſurpriſe and admiration. The Arcadian air of the girls next attracted her attention. Their dreſs was a very ſhort full petticoat of light green, with a boddice of white ſilk; the ſleeves looſe, and tied up at the ſhoulders with ribbons and bunches of flowers. Their hair, falling in ringlets on their necks, was alſo ornamented with flowers, and with a ſmall ſtraw hat, which, ſet rather backward and on one ſide of the head, gave an expreſſion of gaiety and ſmartneſs to the whole figure. When the ſong had concluded, ſeveral of theſe girls approached Emily, and, inviting her to ſit down among them, offered her, and Maddelina, whom they knew, grape<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> and figs.</p>
                     <p>Emily accepted their courteſy, much pleaſed with the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and grace of their manners, which appeared to be perfectly natural to them: and when Bertrand, ſoon after, approached, and was haſtily drawing her away, a peaſant, holding up a flaſk, invited him to drink; a temptation, which Bertrand was ſeldom very valiant in reſiſting.</p>
                     <p>"Let the young lady join in the dance, my friend," ſaid the peaſant, "while we empty this flaſk. They are going to begin directly. Strike up! my lads, ſtrike up your tambourines and merry flutes!"</p>
                     <p>They ſounded gaily; and the younger peaſants formed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into a circle, which Emily would readily have joined, had her ſpirits been in uniſon with their mirth. Maddelina, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, tripped it lightly, and Emily, as ſhe looked on the happy group, loſt the ſenſe of her misfortunes in that of a benevolent

pleaſure. But the penſive melancholy of her mind returned, as ſhe ſat rather apart from the company, liſtening to the mellow muſic, which the breeze ſoftened as it bore it away, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moon, ſtealing its tremulous light over the waves and on the woody ſummits of the cliffs, that wound along theſe Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can ſhores.</p>
                     <p>Meanwhile, Bertrand was ſo well pleaſed with his firſt flaſk, that he very willingly commenced the attack of a ſecond, and it was late before Emily, not without ſome apprehenſion, returned to the cottage.</p>
                     <p>After this evening, ſhe frequently walked with Maddelina, but was never unattended by Bertrand; and her mind became by degrees as tranquil as the circumſtances of her ſituation would permit. The quiet, in which ſhe was ſuffered to live, encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged her to hope, that ſhe was not ſent hither with an evil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; and, had it not appeared probable, that Valancourt was at this time an inhabitant of Udolpho, ſhe would have wiſhed to remain at the cottage, till an opportunity ſhould offer of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her native country. But, concerning Montoni's motive for ſending her into Tuſcany, ſhe was more than ever perplexed, nor could ſhe believe that any conſideration for her ſafety had influenced him on this occaſion.</p>
                     <p>She had been ſometime at the cottage, before ſhe recollected that, in the hurry of leaving Udolpho, ſhe had forgotten the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers committed to her by her late aunt, relative to the Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc eſtates; but, though this remembrance occaſioned her much uneaſineſs, ſhe had ſome hope, that in the obſcure place, where they were depoſited, they would eſcape the detection of Montoni.</p>

                     <p>WE now return for a moment, to Venice, where Count Morano was ſuffering under an accumulation of misfortunes. Soon after his arrival in that city, he had been arreſted by order of the ſenate, and, without knowing of what he was ſuſpected, was conveyed to a place of confinement, whither the moſt ſtren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous

inquiries of his friends had been unable to trace him. Who the enemy was, that had occaſioned him this calamity, he had not been able to gueſs, unleſs, indeed, it was Montoni, on whom his ſuſpicion reſted, and not only with much apparent probabil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, but with juſtice.</p>
                     <p>In the affair of the poiſoned cup, Montoni had ſuſpected Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rano; but, being unable to obtain the degree of proof, which was neceſſary to convict him of a guilty intention, he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to means of other revenge, than he could hope to obtain by proſecution. He employed a perſon, in whom he believed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

As, on theſe occaſions, the accuſer is not confronted with the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, a man may ſafely impeach his enemy, and accompliſh an unjuſt revenge, without fear of puniſhment, or detection. That Montoni ſhould have recourſe to theſe diabolical means of ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a perſon whom he ſuſpected of having attempted his life, is not in the leaſt ſurpriſing. In the letter, which he had employed as the inſtrument of his revenge, he accuſed Morano of deſigns a-aginſt the ſtate, which he attempted to prove with all the plauſible <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>Morano had incurred the perſonal reſentment of many mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſtate; his habits of life had rendered him obnoxious to ſome; and his ambition, and the bold rivalſhip, which he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, on ſeveral public occaſions,—to others; and it was not to be expected, that mercy would ſoften the rigour of a law, which was to be diſpenſed from the hands of his enemies.</p>
                     <p>Montoni, meantime, was beſet by dangers of another kind. His caſtle was beſieged by troops, who ſeemed willing to dare every thing, and to ſuffer patiently any hardſhips in purſuit of victory. The ſtrength of the fortreſs, however, withſtood their attack, and this, with the vigorous defence of the garriſon and the ſcarcity of proviſion on theſe wild mountains, ſoon compelled the aſſailants to raiſe the ſiege.</p>
                     <p>When Udolpho was once more left to the quiet poſſeſſion of Montoni, he diſpatched Ugo into Tuſcany for Emily, whom he
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:029378_0217_0FE084925B1C6248"/>
had ſent from conſiderations of her perſonal ſafety, to a place of greater ſecurity, than a caſtle, which was, at that time, liable to be overrun by his enemies. Tranquillity being once more reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Udolpho, he was impatient to ſecure her again under his roof, and had commiſſioned Ugo to aſſiſt Bertrand in guarding her back to the caſtle. Thus compelled to return, Emily bade the kind Maddelina farewel, with regret, and, after about a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night's ſtay in Tuſcany, where ſhe had experienced an interval of quiet, which was abſolutely neceſſary to ſuſtain her long haraſſed ſpirits, began once more to aſcend the Apennines, from whoſe heights ſhe gave a long and ſorrowful look to the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful country, that extended at their feet, and to the diſtant Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean, whoſe waves ſhe had ſo often wiſhed would bear her back to France. The diſtreſs ſhe felt, on her return towards the place of her former ſufferings, was, however, ſoftened by a conjecture, that Valancourt was there, and ſhe found ſome degree of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the thought of being near him, notwithſtanding the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, that he was probably a priſoner.</p>
                     <p>It was noon, when ſhe had left the cottage, and the evening was cloſed long before ſhe came within the neighbourhood of Udolpho. There was a moon, but it ſhone only at intervals, for the night was cloudy, and lighted by the torch, which Ugo car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, the travellers paced ſilently along. Emily muſing on her ſituation, and Bertrand and Ugo anticipating the comforts of a flaſk of wine and a good fire, for they had perceived for ſome time the difference between the warm climate of the lowlands of Tuſcany and the nipping air of theſe upper regions. Emily was, at length, rouſed from her reverie by the far off ſound of the caſtle clock, to which ſhe liſtened not without ſome degree of awe, as it rolled away on the breeze. Another and another note ſucceeded, and died in ſullen murmur among the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains:—to her mournful imagination it ſeemed a knell meaſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out ſome fatal period for her.</p>
                     <p>"Aye, there is the old clock," ſaid Bertrand, "there he is ſtill; the cannon have not ſilenced him!"</p>
                     <p>"No," anſwered Ugo, "he crowed as loud as the beſt of them in the midſt of it all. There he was roaring out in the hotteſt fire I have ſeen this many a day! I ſaid that ſome of them would have a hit at the old fellow, but he eſcaped, and the tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er too."</p>
                     <p>The road winding round the baſe of a mountain, they now came within view of the caſtle, which was ſhewn in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective of the valley by a gleam of moonſhine, and then vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:029378_0217_0FE084925B1C6248"/>
in ſhade; while even a tranſient view of it had awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened the poignancy of Emily's feelings. Its maſſy and gloomy walls gave her terrible ideas of impriſonment and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: yet, as ſhe advanced, ſome degree of hope mingled with her terror; for, though this was certainly the reſidence of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni, it was poſſibly, alſo, that of Valancourt, and ſhe could not approach a place, where he might be, without experiencing ſomewhat of the joy of hope.</p>
                     <p>They continued to wind along the valley, and, ſoon after, ſhe ſaw again the old walls and moonlight towers, riſing over the woods: the ſtrong rays enabled her, alſo, to perceive the rava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which the ſiege had made,—with the broken walls, and ſhattered battlements, for they were now at the foot of the ſteep, on which Udolpho ſtood. Maſſy fragments had rolled down among the woods, through which the travellers now began to aſcend, and there mingled with the looſe earth, and pieces of rock they had brought with them. The woods, too, had ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much from the batteries above, for here the enemy had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſcreen themſelves from the fire of the ramparts. Many noble trees were levelled with the ground, and others to a wide extent, were entirely ſtripped of their upper branches. "We had better diſmount," ſaid Ugo, "and lead the mules up the hill, or we ſhall get into ſome of the holes, which the balls have left. Here are plenty of them. Give me the torch," con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Ugo, after they had diſmounted, "and take care you don't ſtumble over any thing, that lies in your way, for the ground is not yet cleared of the enemy."</p>
                     <p>"How!" exclaimed Emily, "are any of the enemy here, then?"</p>
                     <p>"Nay, I don't know for that, now," he replied, "but when I came away I ſaw one or two of them lying under the trees."</p>
                     <p>As they proceeded, the torch threw a gloomy light upon the ground, and far among the receſſes of the woods, and Emily fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to look forward, left ſome object of horror ſhould meet her eye. The path was often ſtrewn with broken heads of arrows, and with ſhattered remains of armour, ſuch as at that period was mingled with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ghter dreſs of the ſoldiers. "Bring the light hither," ſaid Bertrand, "I have ſtumbled over ſomething, that rattles loud enough." Ugo holding up the torch, they perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſteel breaſtplate on the ground, which Bertrand raiſed, and they ſaw, that it was pierced through, and that the lining was entirely covered with blood; but upon Emily's earneſt entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that they would proceed, Bertrand, uttering ſome joke upon the unfortunate perſon, to whom it had belonged, threw it hard upon the ground, and they paſſed on.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="208" facs="unknown:029378_0218_0FE08496F425F9C0"/>
At every ſtep ſhe took, Emily feared to ſee ſome veſtige of death. Coming ſoon after to an opening in the woods, Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trand ſtopped to ſurvey the ground, which was encumbered with maſſy trunks and branches of the trees, that had ſo lately adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and ſeemed to have been a ſpot particularly fatal to the beſiegers; for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> was evident from the deſtruction of the trees, that here the hotteſt fire of the garriſon had been directed. As Ugo held again forth the torch, ſteel glittered between the fallen trees<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ground beneath was covered with broken arms, and with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> veſtments of ſoldiers, whoſe mangled forms Emily almoſt expected to ſee; and ſhe again entreated her companions to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, who were, however, too intent in their examination, to regard her, and ſhe turned her eyes from this deſolated ſcene to the caſtle above, where ſhe obſerved lights gliding along the ramparts. Preſently, the caſtle clock ſtruck twelve, and then a trumpet ſounded, of which Emily inquired the occaſion.</p>
                     <p>"O! they are only changing watch," <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Ugo. "I do not remember this trumpet," ſaid Emily, "it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> cuſtom." "It is only an old one revived, lady; we always uſe it in time of war. We have ſounded it, at midnight, ever ſince the place was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged."</p>
                     <p>"Hark!" ſaid Emily, as the trumpet ſounded again; and, in the next moment, ſhe heard a faint claſh of arms, and then the watchword paſſed along the terrace above, and was anſwered from a diſtant part of the caſtle; after which all was again ſtill. She complained of cold, and begged to go on. "Preſently, lady," ſaid Bertrand, turning over ſome broken arms with the pike he uſually carried. "What have we here?"</p>
                     <p>"Hark!" cried Emily, "what noiſe was that?"</p>
                     <p>"What noiſe was it?" ſaid Ugo, ſtarting up and liſtening.</p>
                     <p>"Huſh!" repeated Emily. "It ſurely came from the ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts above:" and, on looking up, they perceived a light mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along the walls, while, in the next inſtant, the breeze ſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the voice ſounded louder than before.</p>
                     <p>"Who goes yonder?" cried a ſentinel of the caſtle. "Speak, or it will be worſe for you." Bertrand uttered a ſhout of joy. "Ah! my brave comrade, is it you?" ſaid he, and he blew a ſhrill whiſtle, which ſignal was anſwered by another from the ſoldier on watch; and the party, then paſſing forward, ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter emerged from the woods upon the broken road, that led im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the caſtle gates, and Emily ſaw, with renewed ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, the whole of that ſtupendous ſtructure. "Alas!" ſaid ſhe to herſelf, "I am going again into my priſon!"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="209" facs="unknown:029378_0218_0FE08496F425F9C0"/>
"Here has been warm work, by St. Marco!" cried Bertrand, waving the torch over the ground; "the balls have torn up the earth here, with a vengeance."</p>
                     <p>"Aye," replied Ugo, "they were fired from that redoubt, yonder, and rare execution they did. The enemy made a furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous attack upon the great gates; but they might have gueſſed they could never carry it there; for, beſides the cannon from the walls, our archers, on the two round towers, ſhowered down upon them at ſuch a rate, that, by holy Peter! there was no ſtanding it. I never ſaw a better <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"Hah! you are at your old tricks again," ſaid Bertrand in a ſurly tone. "It is well for thee thou art ſo near the caſtle; thou knoweſt I have killed my man before now." Ugo replied only by a laugh, and then gave ſome further account of the ſiege, to which as Emily liſtened, ſhe was ſtruck by the ſtrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt of the preſent ſcene with that which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> ſo lately been acted here.</p>
                     <p>The mingled uproar of cannon, drums, and trumpets, the groans of the conquered, and the ſhouts of the conquerers were now funk into a ſilence ſo profound, that it ſeemed as if death had triumphed alike over the vanquiſhed and the victor. The ſhattered condition of one of the towers of the great gates by no means confirmed the <hi>valiant</hi> account juſt given by Ugo of the ſcampering party, who, it was evident, had not only made a ſtand, but had done much miſchief before they took to flight; for this tower appeared, as far as Emily could judge by the dim moonlight that fell upon it, to be laid open, and the battlements were nearly demoliſhed.</p>
                     <p>While ſhe gazed, a light glimmered through one of the lower loopholes, and diſappeared; but, in the next moment, ſhe perceived through the broken wall, a ſoldier, with a lamp, aſcending the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſtaircaſe, that wound within the tower, and, remembering that it was the ſame ſhe had paſſed up, on the night when Barnardine had deluded her with a promiſe of ſeeing Madame Montoni, fancy gave her ſomewhat of the terror ſhe had then ſuffered. She was now very near the gates, over which the ſoldier having opened the door of the portal chamber, the lamp he carried gave her a duſky view of that terrible apartment, and ſhe almoſt ſunk under the recollected horrors of the moment, when ſhe had drawn aſide the curtain, and diſcovered the object it was meant to conceal.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="210" facs="unknown:029378_0219_0FE0846E6CC332B0"/>
"Perhaps," ſaid ſhe to herſelf, "it is now uſed for a ſimilar purpoſe; perhaps, that ſoldier goes, at this dead hour, to watch over the corpſe of his friend!" The little remains of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude now gave way to the united force of remembered and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated horrors, for the melancholy fate of Madame Montoni appeared to foretell her own. She conſidered, that, though the Languedoc eſtates, if ſhe relinquiſhed them, would ſatisfy Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni's avarice, they might not appeaſe his vengeance, which was ſeldom pacified but by a terrible ſacrifice; and ſhe even thought, that, were ſhe to reſign them, the fear of juſtice might urge him either to detain her a priſoner or to take away her life.</p>
                     <p>They were now arrived at the gates, where Bertrand, obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the light glimmer through a ſmall caſement of the portal chamber, called aloud, and the ſoldier looking out, demanded who was there. "Here, I have brought you a priſoner," ſaid Ugo, "open the gate and let us in."</p>
                     <p>"Tell me firſt, who it is that demands entrance," replied the ſoldier. "What! my old comrade," cried Ugo, "don't you know me? not know Ugo? I have brought home a priſoner here, bound hand and foot—a fellow, who has been drinking Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cany wine, while we here have been fighting."</p>
                     <p>"You will not reſt till you meet with your match," ſaid Bertrand ſullenly. "<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Emily preſently heard his ſteps deſcending the ſtairs within, and then the heavy chain fall, and the bolts undraw of a ſmall poſtern door, which he opened to admit the party. He held the lamp low, to ſhew the ſtep of the gate, and ſhe found herſelf once more beneath the gloomy arch, and heard the door cloſe, that ſeemed to ſhut <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

"His <hi>Excellenza</hi> and the Signors," replied the ſoldier: it is a ſign you are a ſtranger at the caſtle, or you would not need to aſk the queſtion.

                     <p>They had now croſſed the ſecond court, and reached the hall door, when the ſoldier, bidding them good night, haſtened back to his poſt; and, while they waited for admittance, Emily conſidered how ſhe might avoid ſeeing Montoni, and retire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noticed to her former apartment, for ſhe ſhrunk from the thought of encountering either him or any of his party, at this hour. The uproar within the caſtle was now ſo loud, that, though Ugo knocked repeatedly at the hall door, he was not heard by any of the ſervants, a circumſtance, which increaſed Emily's alarm, while it allowed her time to deliberate on the means of retiring unobſerved; for, though ſhe might, perhaps, paſs up the great ſtaircaſe unſeen, it was impoſſible ſhe could find the way to her chamber, without a light, the difficulty of procuring which, and the danger of wandering about the caſtle, without one, immediately ſtruck her. Bertrand had only a torch, and ſhe knew, that the ſervants never brought a taper to the door, for the hall was ſufficiently lighted by the large tripod lamp, which hung in the vaulted roof; and, while ſhe ſhould wait till Annette could bring a taper, Montoni, or ſome of his companions, might diſcover her.</p>
                     <p>The door was now opened by Carlo; and Emily, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted him to ſend Annette immediately with a light to the great gallery, where ſhe determined to await her, paſſed on with haſty ſteps towards the ſtaircaſe; while Bertrand and Ugo, with the torch, followed old Carlo to the ſervants' hall, impatient for ſupper and the warm blaze of a wood fire. Emily, lighted only

by the feeble rays, which the lamp above threw between the arches of this extenſive hall, endeavoured to find her way to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> ſtaircaſe, now hid in obſcurity; while the ſhouts of merriment, that burſt from a remote apartment, ſerved, by heightening her terror, to increaſe her perplexity, and ſhe expected, every inſtant, to ſee the door of that room open, and Montoni and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions iſſue forth. Having, at length, reached the ſtaircaſe, and found her way to the top, ſhe ſeated herſelf on the laſt ſtair, to await the arrival of Annette; for the profound darkneſs of the gallery deterred her from proceeding farther, and, while ſhe liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened for her footſtep, ſhe heard only diſtant ſounds of revelry, which roſe in ſullen echoes from among the arcades below. Once ſhe thought ſhe heard a low ſound from the dark gallery behind her; and, turning her eyes, fancied ſhe ſaw ſomething luminous move in it; and, ſince ſhe could not, at this moment, ſubdue the weakneſs that cauſed her fears, ſhe quitted her ſeat, and crept ſoftly down a few ſtairs lower.</p>
                     <p>Annette not yet appearing, Emily now concluded, that ſhe was gone to bed, and that nobody choſe to call her up; and the proſpect, that preſented itſelf, of paſſing the night in darkneſs, in this place, or in ſome other equally forlorn (for ſhe knew it would be impracticable to find her way through the intracies of the galleries to her chamber) drew tears of mingled terror and deſpondency from her eyes.</p>
                     <p>While thus ſhe ſat, ſhe fancied ſhe heard again an odd ſound from the gallery, and ſhe liſtened, ſcarcely daring to breathe, but the increaſing voices below overcame every other ſound. Soon after, ſhe heard Montoni and his companions burſt into the hall, who ſpoke, as if they were much intoxicated, and ſeemed to be advancing towards the ſtaircaſe. She now remembered, that they muſt come this way to their chambers, and, forgetting all the terrors of the gallery, hurried towards it wiſh an intention of ſecreting herſelf in ſome of the paſſages, that opened beyond, and of endeavouring, when the Signors were retired, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>With extended arms, ſhe crept along the gallery, ſtill hearing the voices of perſons below, who ſeemed to ſtop in converſation at the foot of the ſtaircaſe, and then pauſing for a moment to liſten, half fearful of going further into the darkneſs of the galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, where ſhe ſtill imagined, from the noiſe ſhe had heard, that ſome perſon was lurking, "They are already informed of my arrival," ſaid ſhe, "and Montoni is coming himſelf to ſeek me!
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:029378_0220_0FE084A835C6F7C0"/>
In the preſent ſtate of his mind, his purpoſe muſt be deſperate." Then, recollecting the ſcene, that had paſſed in the corridor, on the night preceding her departure from the caſtle, "O Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt!" ſaid ſhe, "I muſt then reſign you for ever. To brave any longer the injuſtice of Montoni, would not be fortitude, but raſhneſs." Still the voices below did not draw nearer, but they became louder, and ſhe diſtinguiſhed thoſe of Verezzi and Bertolini above the reſt, while the few words ſhe caught made her liſten more anxiouſly for others. The converſation ſeemed to concern herſelf; and, having ventured to ſtep a few paces nearer to the ſtaircaſe, ſhe diſcovered, that they were diſputing about her, each ſeeming to claim ſome former promiſe of Montoni, who appeared, at firſt, inclined to appeaſe and to perſuade them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their wine, but afterwards to be weary of the diſpute, and, ſaying that he left them to ſettle it as they could, was returning with the reſt of the party to the apartment he had juſt quitted. Verezzi then ſtopped him. "Where is ſhe? Signor," ſaid he, in a voice of impatience: "tell us where ſhe is." "I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready told you that I do not know," replied Montoni, who ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be ſomewhat overcome with wine; "but ſhe is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably gone to her apartment." Verezzi and Bertolini now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted from their inquiries, and ſprang to the ſtaircaſe together, while Emily, who, during this diſcourſe, had trembled ſo exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, that ſhe had with difficulty ſupported herſelf, ſeemed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired with new ſtrength, the moment ſhe heard the bound of their ſteps and ran along the gallery, dark as it was, with the fleetneſs of a fawn. But, long before ſhe reached its extremity, the light, which Verezzi carried, flaſhed upon the walls; both appeared, and, inſtantly perceiving Emily, purſued her. At this moment, Bertolini, whoſe ſteps though ſwift, were not ſteady, and whoſe impatience overcame what little caution he had hith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erto uſed, ſtumbled, and fell at his length. The lamp fell with him, and was preſently expiring on the floor; but Verezzi, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of ſaving it, ſeized the advantage this accident gave him over his rival, and followed Emily, to whom, however, the light had ſhone one of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

This paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage at length brought Emily to the corridor, into which her own

chamber opened, and, not hearing any footſtep, ſhe pauſed to take breath, and conſider what was the ſafeſt deſign to be adopted. She had followed this paſſage, merely becauſe it was the firſt that appeared, and now that ſhe had reached the end of it, was as perplexed as before. Whither to go, or how fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to find her way in the dark, ſhe knew not; ſhe was aware only that ſhe muſt not ſeek her apartment, for there ſhe would certainly be ſought, and her danger increaſed every inſtant, while ſhe remained near it. Her ſpirits and her breath, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, were ſo much exhauſted, that ſhe was compelled to reſt, for a few minutes, at the end of the paſſage, and ſtill ſhe heard no ſteps approaching. As thus ſhe ſtood, light glimmered under an oppoſite door of the gallery, and, from its ſituation, ſhe knew, that it was the door of that myſterious chamber, where ſhe had made a diſcovery ſo ſhocking, that ſhe never remembered it but with the utmoſt horror. That there ſhould be light in this chamber, and at this hour, excited her ſtrong ſurpriſe, and ſhe felt a momentary terror concering it, which did not permit her to look again, for her ſpirits were now in ſuch a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that ſhe almoſt expected to ſee the door ſlowly open, and ſome horrible object appear at it. Still ſhe liſtened for a ſtep along the paſſage, and looked up it, where not a ray of light ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, ſhe concluded, that Verezzi had gone back for the lamp; and, believing that he would ſhortly be there, ſhe again conſidered which way ſhe ſhould go, or rather which way ſhe could find in the dark.</p>
                     <p>A faint ray ſtill glimmered under the oppoſite door, but ſo great, and, perhaps, ſo juſt was her horror of that chamber, that ſhe would not again have tempted its ſecrets, though ſhe had been certain of obtaining the light ſo important to her ſafety. She was ſtill breathing with difficulty, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

"The air is freſher here," ſaid he: "this ſhould be the corridor." Perhaps, he was one of thoſe heroes, whoſe courage can defy an enemy better tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The moment ſhe heard his ſteps ſteal away, ſhe left her ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and moved ſoftly to the other end of the corridor, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

She now glided into a paſſage, that opened on the left, without, as ſhe thought, being perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but in the next inſtant, another light, glimmering at the further end of this paſſage, threw her into new terror. While ſhe ſtopped and heſitated which way to go, the pauſe allowed her to perceive, that it was Annette who advanced, and ſhe hurried to meet her: but her imprudence again alarmed Emily, on per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving whom, ſhe burſt into a ſcream of joy, and it was ſome minutes, before ſhe could be prevailed with to be ſilent, or to releaſe her miſtreſs from the ardent claſp, in which ſhe held her. When, at length, Emily made Annette comprehend her danger, they hurried towards Annette's room, which was in a diſtant part of the caſtle. No apprehenſions, however, could yet ſilence the latter. "Oh dear ma'amſelle," ſaid ſhe, as they paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, "what a terrified time have I had of it! Oh! I thought I ſhould have died an hundred times! I never thought I ſhould live to ſee you again! and I never was ſo glad to ſee any body in my whole life, as I am to ſee you now." "Hark!" cried Emily, "we are purſued; that was the echo of ſteps!" "No, ma'amſelle," ſaid Annette, "it was only the echo of a door ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; ſound runs along theſe vaulted paſſages ſo, that one is continually deceived by it; if one does but ſpeak, or cough, it makes a noiſe as loud as a cannon." "Then there is the greater neceſſity for us to be ſilent," ſaid Emily: "pr'ythee ſay no more, till we reach your chamber." Here, at length, they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, without interruption, and Annette having faſtened the door, Emily ſat down on her little bed, to recover breath and compoſure. To her inquiry, whether Valancourt was among the priſoners in the caſtle, Annette replied, that ſhe had not been able to hear, but that ſhe knew there were ſeveral perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined. She then proceeded, in her tedious way, to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ſiege, or rather a detail of her terrors and various ſufferings, during the attack. "But, added ſhe, "when I heard the ſhouts of victory from the ramparts, I thought we were all taken, and gave myſelf up for loſt, inſtead of which, <hi>we</hi> had
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:029378_0222_0FE084BC1E2A59E0"/>
driven the enemy away. I went then to the north gallery, and ſaw a great many of them ſcampering away among the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; but the rampart walls were all in ruins, as one may ſay, and there was a diſmal ſight to ſee down among the woods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, where the poor fellows were lying in heaps, but were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off preſently by their comrades. While the ſiege was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, the Signor was here, and there, and every where, at the ſame time, as Ludovico told me, for he would not let me ſee any thing hardly, and locked me up, as he has often done before, in a room in the middle of the caſtle, and uſed to bring me food, and come and talk with me as often as he could; and I muſt ſay, if it had not been for Ludovico, I ſhould have died outright."</p>
                     <p>"Well, Annette," ſaid Emily, "and how have affairs gone on, ſince the ſiege?"</p>
                     <p>"O! ſad hurly burly doings, ma'amſelle," replied Annette; "the Signors have done nothing but ſit and drink and game, ever ſince. They ſit up, all night, and play among themſelves, for all thoſe riches and fine things, they brought in, ſometime ſince, when they uſed to go out a robbing, or as good, for days together; and then they have dreadful quarrels about, who loſes, and who wins. That fierce Signor Verezzi is always loſing, as they tell me, and Signor Orſino wins from him, and this makes him very wroth, and they have had ſeveral hard ſet-to's about it. Then, all thoſe fine ladies are at the caſtle ſtill; and I declare I am frighted, whenever I meet any of them in the paſſages."</p>
                     <p>"Surely, Annette," ſaid Emily, ſtarting, "I heard a noiſe: liſten." After a long pauſe, "No, Ma'amſelle," ſaid Annette, "it was only the wind in the gallery; I often hear it, when it ſhakes the old doors, at the other end. But won't you go to bed, ma'amſelle? you ſurely will not ſit up ſtarving, all night." Emily now laid herſelf down on the mattreſs, and deſired Annette to leave the lamp burning on the hearth: having done which, the latter placed herſelf beſide Emily, who, however, was not ſuffered to ſleep, for ſhe again thought ſhe heard a noiſe from the paſſage; and Annette was again trying to convince her, that it was only the wind, when footſteps were diſtinctly heard near the door. Annette was now ſtarting from the bed, but Emily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with her to remain there, and liſtened with her in a ſtate of terrible expectation. The ſteps ſtill loitered at the door, when preſently an attempt was made on the lock, and, in the next inſtant, a voice called. "For heaven's ſake, Annette, do not anſwer," ſaid Emily ſoftly, "remain quite ſtill; but I fear we muſt extinguiſh the lamp, or its glare will betray us." "Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:029378_0222_0FE084BC1E2A59E0"/>
Virgin!" exclaimed Annette, forgetting her diſcretion, "I would not be in darkneſs now for the whole world." While ſhe ſpoke, the voice became louder than before, and repeated An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette's name; "Bleſſed Virgin!" cried ſhe ſuddenly, "it is only Ludovico." She roſe to open the door, but Emily prevented her, till they ſhould be more certain, that it was he alone; with whom Annette, at length, talked for ſometime, and learned, that he was come to inquire after herſelf, whom he had let out of her room to go to Emily, and that he was now returned to lock her in again. Emily, fearful of being overheard, if they converſed any longer through the door, conſented that it ſhould be opened, and a young man appeared, whoſe open countenance confirmed the favourable opinion of him, which his care of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette had already prompted her to form. She intreated his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, ſhould Verezzi make this requiſite; and Ludovico of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to paſs the night in an old chamber, adjoining, that opened from the gallery, and, on the firſt alarm, to come to their defence.</p>
                     <p>Emily was much ſoothed by this propoſal; and Ludovico, having lighted his lamp, went to his ſtation, while ſhe, once more, endeavoured to repoſe on her mattreſs. But a variety of intereſts preſſed upon her attention, and prevented ſleep. She thought much on what Annette had told her of the diſſolute manners of Montoni and his aſſociates, and more of his preſent conduct towards herſelf, and of the danger, from which ſhe had juſt eſcaped. From the view of her preſent ſituation ſhe ſhrunk, as from a new picture of terror. She ſaw herſelf in a caſtle, inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited by vice and violence, ſeated beyond the reach of law, or juſtice, and in the power of a man, whoſe perſeverance was equal to every occaſion, and in whom paſſions, of which revenge was not the weakeſt, entirely ſupplied the place of principles. She was compelled, once more, to acknowledge, that it would be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not fortitude, any longer to dare his power; and, reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all hopes of future happineſs with Valancourt, ſhe determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that, on the following morning, ſhe would compromiſe with Montoni, and give up her eſtates, on condition, that he would permit her immediate return to France. Such conſiderations kept her waking for many hours; but, the night paſſed without further alarm from Verezzi.</p>
                     <p>On the next morning, Emily had a long converſation with Ludovico, in which ſhe heard circumſtances concering the caſtle, and received hints of the deſigns of Montoni, that conſiderably increaſed her alarms. On expreſſing her ſurpriſe, that Ludovico, who ſeemed to be ſo ſenſible of the evils of his ſituation, ſhould continue in it, he informed her, that it was not his intention to do
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:029378_0223_0FE084C831B36380"/>
ſo, and ſhe then ventured to aſk him, if he would aſſiſt her to eſcape from the caſtle. Ludovico aſſured her of his readineſs to attempt this, but ſtrongly repreſented the difficulty of the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, and the certain deſtruction which muſt enſue, ſhould Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni overtake them, before they had paſſed the mountains; he, however, promiſed to be watchful of every circumſtance, that might contribute to the ſucceſs of the attempt, and to think up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome plan of departure.</p>
                     <p>Emily now confided to him the name of Valancourt, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged he would inquire for ſuch a perſon among the priſoners in the caſtle; for the faint hope, which this converſation awakened, made her now recede from her reſolution of an immediate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſe with Montoni. She determined, if poſſible, to delay this, till ſhe heard further from Ludovico, and, if his deſigns were found to be impracticable, to reſign the eſtates at once.—Her thoughts were on this ſubject, when Montoni, was now reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the intoxication of the preceding night, ſent for her, and ſhe immediately obeyed the ſummons. He was alone. "I find," ſaid he, "that you were not in your chamber, laſt night; where were you?" Emily related to him ſome circumſtances of her alarm, and entreated his protection from a repetition of them. "You know the terms of my protection," ſaid he; "if you real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly value this, you will ſecure it." His open declaration, that he would only conditionally protect her, while ſhe remained a priſoner in the caſtle, ſhewed Emily the neceſſity of an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate compliance with his terms; but ſhe firſt demanded, whether he would permit her immediately to depart, if ſhe gave up her claim to the conteſted eſtates. In a very ſolemn manner he then aſſured her, that he would, and immediately laid before her a paper, which was to transfer the right of thoſe eſtates to himſelf.</p>
                     <p>She was, for a conſiderable time, unable to ſign it, and her heart was torn with contending intereſts, for ſhe was about to reſign the happineſs of all her future years—the hope, which had ſuſtained her in ſo many hours of adverſity.</p>
                     <p>After hearing from Montoni a recapitulation of the conditions of her compliance, and a remonſtrance, that his time was valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſhe put her hand to the paper; when ſhe had done which, ſhe fell back in her chair, but ſoon recovered, and deſired, that he would give orders for her departure, and that he would allow Annette to accompany her. Montoni ſmiled. "It was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to deceive you," ſaid he—"there was no other way of making you act reaſonably; you ſhall go, but it muſt not be at preſent. I muſt firſt ſecure theſe eſtates by poſſeſſion: when that is done, you may return to France if you will."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="219" facs="unknown:029378_0223_0FE084C831B36380"/>
The deliberate villainy, with which he violated the ſolemn engagement he had juſt entered into, ſhocked Emily as much, as the certainty, that ſhe had made a fruitleſs ſacrifice, and muſt ſtill remain his priſoner. She had no words to expreſs what ſhe felt, and knew, that it would have been uſeleſs, if ſhe had. As ſhe looked piteouſly at Montoni, he turned away, and at the ſame time deſired ſhe would withdraw to her apartment; but, unable to leave the room, ſhe ſat down in a chair near the door, and ſighed heavily. She had neither words nor tears.</p>
                     <p>"Why will you indulge this childiſh grief?" ſaid he. "En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſtrengthen your mind, to bear patiently what cannot now be avoided; you have no real evil to lament; be patient, and you will be ſent back to France. At preſent retire to your apartment."</p>
                     <p>"I dare not go, ſir," ſaid ſhe, "where I ſhall be liable to the intruſion of Signor Verezzi." "Have I not promiſed to protect you?" ſaid Montoni. "You have promiſed ſir,"—replied Emily, after ſome heſitation. "And is not my promiſe ſufficient?" added he ſternly. "You will recollect your former promiſe, Signor," ſaid Emily, trembling, "and may determine for me, whether I ought to rely upon this." "Will you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke me to declare to you, that I will not protect you then?" ſaid Montoni, in a tone of haughty diſpleaſure. "If that will ſatisfy you, I will do it immediately. Withdraw to your cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, before I retract my promiſe: you have nothing to fear there."

Here, while ſhe looked out for ſome hope to ſupport her fainting ſpirits, which had been ſo long haraſſed and oppreſſed, that, if ſhe had not now ſtruggled much againſt misfortune, they would have left her, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, for ever, ſhe endeavoured to believe, that Montoni did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally intend to permit her return to France as ſoon as he had ſecured her property, and that he would, in the meantime, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect her from inſult; but her chief hope reſted with Lodovico, who, ſhe doubted not, would be zealous in her cauſe, though he ſeemed almoſt to deſpair of ſucceſs in it. One circumſtance, however, ſhe had to rejoice in. Her prudence, or rather her fears, had ſaved her from mentioning the name of Valancourt to

Montoni, which ſhe was ſeveral times on the point of doing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> before ſhe ſigned the paper, and of ſtipulating for his releaſe, if he ſhould be really a priſoner in the caſtle. Had ſhe done this, Montoni's jealous fears would now probably have loaded Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court with new ſeverities, and have ſuggeſted the advantage of holding him a captive for life.</p>
                     <p>Thus paſſed the melancholy day, as ſhe had before paſſed many in the ſame chamber. When night drew on, ſhe would have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn herſelf to Annette's bed, had not a particular intereſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined her to remain in this chamber, in ſpite of her fears; for, when the caſtle ſhould be ſtill, and the cuſtomary hour arrived, ſhe determined to watch for the muſic, which ſhe had formerly heard. Though its ſounds might not enable her poſitively to determine, whether Valancourt was there, they would perhaps ſtrengthen her opinion that he was, and impart the comfort, ſo neceſſary to her preſent ſupport.—But, on the other hand, if all ſhould be ſilent!—She hardly dared to ſuffer her thoughts to glance that way, but waited, with impatient expectation the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching hour.</p>
                     <p>The night was ſtormy; the battlements of the caſtle appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to rock in the wind, and, at intervals, long groans ſeemed to paſs on the air, ſuch as thoſe, which often deceive the melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mind, in tempeſts, and amidſt ſcenes of deſolation. Emily heard as formerly, the ſentinels paſs along the terrace to their poſts, and, looking out from her caſement, obſerved, that the watch was doubled; a precaution, which appeared neceſſary enough, when ſhe threw her eyes on the walls, and ſaw their ſhattered condition. The well known ſounds of the ſoldiers' march, and of their diſtant voices, which paſſed her in the wind, and were loſt again, recalled to her memory the melancholy ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations ſhe had ſuffered, when ſhe formerly heard the ſame ſounds and occaſioned almoſt involuntary compariſons between her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and her late ſituation. But this was no ſubject for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulation, and ſhe wiſely checked the courſe of her thoughts, while, as the hour was not yet come, in which ſhe had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to hear the muſic, ſhe cloſed the caſement, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to await it in patience. The door of the ſtaircaſe ſhe tried to ſecure, as uſual, with ſome of the furniture of the room; but this expedient her fears now repreſented to her to be very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adequate to the power and perſeverance of Verezzi; and ſhe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten looked at a large and heavy cheſt, that ſtood in the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, with wiſhes that ſhe and Annette had ſtrength enough to move it. While ſhe blamed the long ſtay of this girl, who was

ſtill with Ludovico and ſome other of the ſervants, ſhe trimmed her wood fire, to make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> room appear leſs deſolate, and ſat down beſide it with a book, which her eyes peruſed, while her thoughts wandered to Valancourt, and her own misfortunes. As ſhe ſat thus, ſhe thought, in a pauſe of the wind, ſhe diſtinguiſhed muſic, and went to the caſement to liſten, but the loud ſwell of the guſt overcame every other ſound. When the wind ſunk again, ſhe heard diſtinctly, in the deep pauſe that ſucceeded, the ſweet ſtrings of a lute; but again the riſing tempeſt bore away the notes, and again was ſucceeded by a ſolemn pauſe. Emily, trembling with hope and fear, opened her caſement to liſten, and to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther her own voice could be heard by the muſician; for to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure any longer this ſtate of torturing ſuſpenſe concerning Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt, ſeemed to be utterly impoſſible. There was a kind of breathleſs ſtillneſs in the chambers, that permitted her to dinſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh from below the tender notes of the very lute ſhe had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly heard, and with it, a plaintive voice, made ſweeter by the low ruſtling ſound, that now began to creep along the wood tops, till it was loſt in the riſing wind. Their tall heads then began to wave, while, through a foreſt of pine, on the left, the wind, groaning heavily, rolled onward over the woods below, bending them almoſt to their roots; and, as the long reſounding gale ſwept away, other woods, on the right, ſeemed to anſwer the "loud lament;" then, others, further ſtill, ſoftened it into a murmur, that died into ſilence. Emily liſtened, with mingled awe and expectation, hope and fear; and again the melting ſweetneſs of the lute was heard, and the ſame ſolemn breathing voice. Convinced that theſe came from an apartment under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, ſhe leaned far out of her window, that ſhe might diſcover whether any light was there; but the caſements below, as well as thoſe above, were ſunk ſo deep in the thick walls of the caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, that ſhe could not ſee them, or even the faint ray, that prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably glimmered through their bars. She then ventured to call, but the wind bore her voice to the other end of the terrace, and then the muſic was heard as before, in the pauſe of the guſt. Suddenly, ſhe thought ſhe heard a noiſe in her chamber, and ſhe drew herſelf within the caſement; but, in a moment after, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing Annette's voice at the door, ſhe concluded it was her ſhe had heard before, and ſhe let her in. "Move ſoftly, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette, to the caſement," ſaid ſhe, "and liſten with me; the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic is returned." They were ſilent till, the meaſure changing, Annette exclaimed, "Holy Virgin! I know that ſong well; it is a French ſong, one of the favourite ſongs of my dear country."
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:029378_0225_0FE084DB53DD5F78"/>
This was the ballad Emily had heard on a former night, though not the one ſhe had firſt liſtened to from the fiſhing houſe in Gaſcony. "O! it is a Frenchman, that ſings," ſaid Annette: "It muſt be Monſieur Valancourt." "Hark! Annette, do not ſpeak ſo loud," ſaid Emily, "we may be overheard." "What! by the Chevalier?" ſaid Annette. No," replied Emily mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, "but by ſome body, who may report us to the Signor. What reaſon have you to think it is Monſieur Valancourt, who ſings? But hark! now the voice ſwells louder! Do you recollect thoſe tones? I fear to truſt my own judgment." "I never happened to hear the Chevalier ſing, Mademoiſelle," replied Annette, who, as Emily was diſappointed to perceive, had no ſtronger reaſon for concluding this to be Valancourt, than that the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician muſt be a Frenchman. Soon after, ſhe heard the ſong of the fiſhing houſe, and diſtinguiſhed her own name, which was repeated ſo diſtinctly, that Annette had heard it alſo. She trembled, ſunk into a chair by the window, and Annette called aloud, "Monſieur Valancourt! Monſieur Valancourt!" while Emily endeavoured to check her, but ſhe repeated the call more loudly than before, and the lute, and the voice ſuddenly ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. Emily liſtened, for ſometime, in a ſtate of intolerable ſuſpenſe; but, no anſwer being returned, "It does not ſignify, mademoiſelle," ſaid Annette; "it is the Chevalier, and I will ſpeak to him." "No, Annette," ſaid Emily, "I think I will ſpeak myſelf; if it is he, he will know my voice, and ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain." "Who is it," ſaid ſhe, "that ſings at this late hour?"</p>
                     <p>A long ſilence enſued, and having repeated the queſtion, ſhe perceived ſome faint accents, mingling in the blaſt, that ſwept by; but the ſounds were ſo diſtant, and paſſed ſo ſuddenly, that ſhe could ſcarcely hear them, much leſs diſtinguiſh the words they ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, or recogniſe the voice. After another pauſe, Emily called again; and again they heard a voice, but as faintly as before; and they perceived, that there were other circumſtances, beſides the ſtrength, and direction of the wind, to contend with; for the great depth, at which the caſements were fixed in the caſtle walls, contributed, ſtill more than the diſtance, to prevent articulated ſounds from being underſtood, though general ones were eaſily heard. Emily, however, ventured to believe, from the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of her voice alone having been anſwered, that the ſtranger was Valancourt, as well as that he knew her, and ſhe gave her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up to ſpeechleſs joy. Annette however, was not ſpeechleſs. She renewed her calls, but received no anſwer; and Emily, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that a further attempt, which certainly was, at preſent,
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:029378_0225_0FE084DB53DD5F78"/>
highly dangerous, might expoſe them to the guards of the caſtle, while it could not perhaps terminate her ſuſpenſe, inſiſted on Annette's dropping the inquiry for this night; though ſhe deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined herſelf to queſtion Ludovico, on the ſubject, in the morning, more urgently than ſhe had yet done. She was now enabled to ſay, that the ſtranger, whom ſhe had formerly heard, was ſtill in the caſtle, and to direct Ludovico, to that part of it, in which he was confined.</p>
                     <p>Emily, attended by Annette, continued at the caſement, for ſometime, but all remained ſtill; they heard neither lute or voice again, and Emily was now as much oppreſſed by anxious joy, as ſhe lately was by a ſenſe of her misfortunes. With haſty ſteps ſhe paced the room, now half calling on Valancourt's name, then ſuddenly ſtopping, and now going to the caſement and liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening, where, however, ſhe heard nothing but the ſolemn wav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the woods. Sometimes her impatience to ſpeak to Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovico prompted her to ſend Annette to call him; but a ſenſe of the impropriety of this at midnight reſtrained her. Annette meanwhile, as impatient as her miſtreſs, went as often to the caſement to liſten, and returned almoſt as much diſappointed. She, at length, mentioned Signor Verezzi, and her fear, leſt he ſhould enter the chamber by the ſtaircaſe door. "But the night is now almoſt paſt, mademoiſelle," ſaid ſhe, recollecting herſelf, "there is the morning light, beginning to peep over thoſe moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains yonder in the eaſt."</p>
                     <p>Emily had forgotten till this moment, that ſuch a perſon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted as Verezzi, and all the danger that had appeared to threaten her; but the mention of his name renewed her alarm, and ſhe remembered the old cheſt, that ſhe had wiſhed to place againſt the door, which ſhe now, with Annette, attempted to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> but it was ſo heavy, that they could not lift it from the floor, "What is in this great old cheſt, mademoiſelle," ſaid Annette, "that makes it ſo weighty?" Emily having replied, "that ſhe found it in the chamber, when ſhe firſt came to the caſtle, and had never examined it,"—"Then I will, ma'amſelle," ſaid An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette, and ſhe tried to lift the lid; but this was held by a lock, for which ſhe had no key, and which, indeed, appeared, from its peculiar conſtruction, to open with a ſpring. The morning now glimmered through the caſements, and the wind had ſunk into a calm. Emily looked out upon the duſky woods, and on the twilight mountains, juſt ſtealing on the eye, and ſaw the whole ſcene, after the ſtorm, lying in profound ſtillneſs, the woods mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionleſs, and the clouds above, through which the dawn trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled

ſcarcely appearing to move along the heavens. One ſoldier was pacing the terrace beneath, with meaſured ſteps; and two, more diſtant, were ſunk aſleep on the walls, wearied with the night's watch. Having inhaled, for a while, the pure ſpirit of the air, and of vegetation, which the late rains had called forth, and having liſtened, once more, for a note of muſic, ſhe now cloſed the caſement, and retired to reſt.</p>

During this interval, Emily eſcaped the perſecutions of Bertolini, and Verezzi, by confining herſelf to her apartment; except that ſometimes, in an evening, ſhe ventured to walk in the adjoining corridor. Montoni ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to reſpect his laſt promiſe, though he had prophaned his firſt; for to his protection only could ſhe attribute her preſent repoſe; and in this ſhe was now ſo ſecure, that ſhe did not wiſh to leave the caſtle, till ſhe could obtain ſome certainty concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Valancourt; for which ſhe waited, indeed, without any ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of her own comfort, ſince no circumſtance had occurred to make her eſcape probable.</p>

On the fourth day, Ludovico informed her, that he had hopes of being admitted to the preſence of the priſoner; it being the turn of a ſoldier, with whom he had been for ſometime famil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iar, to attend him on the following night. He was not deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his hope; for under pretence of carrying in a pitcher of water, he entered the priſon, though, his prudence having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented him from telling the ſentinel the real motive of his viſit, he was obliged to make his conference with the priſoner a very ſhort one.</p>
                     <p>Emily awaited the reſult in her own apartment, Ludovico having promiſed to accompany Annette to the corridor, in the evening; where, after ſeveral hours impatiently counted, he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived. Emily, having then uttered the name of Valancourt, could articulate no more, but heſitated in trembling expectation. "The Chevalier would not entruſt me with his name, Signora," replied Ludovico; "but, when I juſt mentioned yours, he ſeemed overwhelmed with joy, though he was not ſo much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed as I expected." "Does he then remember me?" ſhe exclaimed.</p>
                     <p>"O! it is Monſ. Valancourt," ſaid Annette, and looked im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently at Ludovico, who underſtood her look, and replied to Emily: "Yes, lady, the Chevalier does, indeed, remember you, and, I am ſure, has a very great regard for you, and I made bold to ſay you had for him. He then inquired how you came to know he was in the caſtle, and whether you ordered me to ſpeak to him. The firſt queſtion I could not anſwer, but the ſecond I did; and then he went off into his ecſtaſies again. I was afraid his joy would have betrayed him to the ſentinel at the door."</p>
                     <p>"But how does he look, Ludovico?" interrupted Emily: "is he not melancholy and ill with this long confinement?"—"Why, as to melancholy, I ſaw no ſymptom of that, lady, while I was with him, for he ſeemed in the fineſt ſpirits I ever ſaw any body in, in all my life. His countenance was all joy, and, if one may judge from that, he was very well; but I did not aſk him." "Did he ſend me no meſſage?" ſaid Emily. "O yes, Signora, and ſomething beſides," replied Ludovico, who ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his pockets. "Surely, I have not loſt it," added he. "The Chevalier ſaid, he would have written, madam, if he had had pen and ink, and was going to have ſent a very long meſſage, when the ſentinel entered the room, but not before he had given me this." Ludovico then drew forth a miniature from his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, which Emily received with a trembling hand, and perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:029378_0229_0FE084F22ED31F20"/>
to be a portrait of herſelf—the very picture which her mother had loſt ſo ſtrangely in the fiſhing houſe at La Vallee.</p>
                     <p>Tears of mingled joy and tenderneſs flowed to her eyes, while Ludovico proceeded—"Tell your Lady, ſaid the Chevalier, as he gave me the picture, 'that this has been my companion, and only ſolace in all my misfortunes. Tell her, that I have worn it next my heart, and that I ſend it her as the pledge of an affection, which can never die; that I would not part with it, but to her, for the wealth of worlds, and that I now part with it, only in the hope of ſoon receiving it from her hands. Tell her'—Juſt then, Signora, the ſentinel came in, and the Chevalier ſaid no more; but he had before aſked me to contrive an interview for him with you; and when I told him, how little hope I had of prevailing with the guard to aſſiſt me, he ſaid, that was not, perhaps, of ſo much conſequence as I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agined, and bade me contrive to bring back your anſwer, and he would inform me of more than he choſe to do then. So this, I think lady, is the whole of what paſſed."</p>
                     <p>"How, Ludovico, ſhall I reward you for your zeal?" ſaid Emily: "but, indeed, I do not now poſſeſs the means. When can you ſee the Chevalier again?" "That is uncertain, Signo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra," replied he. "It depends upon who ſtands guard next: there are not more than one or two among them, from whom I would dare to aſk admittance to the priſon chamber."</p>
                     <p>"I need not bid you remember, Ludovico," reſumed Emily, "how very much intereſted I am in your ſeeing the Chevalier ſoon; and, when you do ſo, tell him, that I have received the picture, and, with the ſentiments he wiſhed. Tell him I have ſuffered much, and ſtill ſuffer—" She pauſed. "But ſhall I tell him you will ſee him, lady?" ſaid Ludovico. "Moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly I will," replied Emily. "But when, Signora, and where?" "That muſt depend upon circumſtances," returned Emily.—"The place, and the hour, muſt be regulated by his opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities."</p>
                     <p>"As to the place, mademoiſelle," ſaid Annette, "there is no other place in the caſtle, beſides this corridor, where <hi>we</hi> can ſee him in ſafety, you know; and, as for the hour,—it muſt be when all the Signors are aſleep, if that ever happens!" "You may mention theſe circumſtances to the Chevalier, Ludovico," ſaid ſhe, checking the flippancy of Annette, and leave them to his judgment and opportunity. Tell him my heart is unchanged. But, above all, let him ſee you again as ſoon as poſſible; and, Ludovico, I think it is needleſs to tell you I ſhall very anxiouſly

                     <p>A week elapſed, before Ludovico again viſited the priſon; for the ſentinels, during that period, were men, in whom he could not confide, and he feared to awaken curioſity, by aſking to ſee their priſoner. In this interval, he communicated to Emily ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rific reports of what was paſſing in the caſtle; of riots, quarrels, and of carouſals more alarming than either; while from ſome circumſtances, which he mentioned, ſhe not only doubted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Montoni meant ever to releaſe her, but greatly feared, that he had deſigns concerning her,—ſuch as ſhe had formerly dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Her name was frequently mentioned in the converſations, which Bertolini and Verezzi held together, and, at thoſe times, they were frequently in contention. Montoni had loſt large ſums to Verezzi, ſo that there was a dreadful poſſibility of his deſigning her to be a ſubſtitute for the debt; but, as ſhe was ignorant, that he had formerly encouraged the hopes of Bertoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni alſo, concerning herſelf, after the latter had done him ſome ſignal ſervice, ſhe knew not how to account for theſe contentions between Bertolini and Verezzi. The cauſe of them, however, appeared to be of little conſequence, for ſhe thought ſhe ſaw de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction approaching in many forms, and her entreaties to Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovico to contrive an eſcape, and to ſee the priſoner again, were more urgent than ever.</p>
                     <p>At length, he informed her, that he had again viſited the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier, who had directed him to confide in the guard of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, from whom he had already received ſome inſtances of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and who had promiſed to permit his going into the caſtle for half an hour, on the enſuing night, when Montoni and his companions ſhould be engaged at their carouſals. "This was kind, to be ſure," added Ludovico: "but Sebaſtian knows he runs no riſque in letting the Chevalier out, for, if he can get be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the bars and iron doors of the caſtle, he muſt be cunning indeed. But the Chevalier deſired me, Signora, to go to you
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:029378_0230_0FE084F6F67CE9E0"/>
immediately, and to beg you would allow him to viſit you, this night, if it was only for a moment, for that he could no longer live under the ſame roof, without ſeeing you; the hour, he ſaid, he could not mention, for it muſt depend on circumſtances (juſt as you ſaid, Signora) and the place he deſired you would appoint, as knowing which was beſt for your own ſafety."</p>
                     <p>Emily was now ſo much agitated by the near proſpect of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Valancourt, that it was ſometime, before ſhe could give any anſwer to Ludovico, or conſider of the place of meeting; when ſhe did, ſhe ſaw none, that promiſed ſo much ſecurity, as the corridor, near her own apartment, which ſhe was checked from leaving, by the apprehenſion of meeting any of Montoni's gueſts, on their way to their rooms; and ſhe diſmiſſed the ſcruples, which delicacy oppoſed, now that a ſerious danger was to be avoided dy encountering them. It was ſettled, therefore, that the Chevalier ſhould meet her in the corridor, at that hour of the night, which Ludovico, who was to be upon the watch, ſhould judge ſafeſt: and Emily, as may be imagined, paſſed this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val in a tumult of hope and joy, anxiety and impatience. Never, ſince her reſidence in the caſtle, had ſhe watched, with ſo much pleaſure, the ſun ſet behind th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> mountains, and twilight ſhade, and darkneſs veil the ſcene, as on this evening. She counted the notes of the great clock, and liſtened to the ſteps of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels, as they changed the watch, only to rejoice, that another hour was gone. "O, Valancourt!" ſaid ſhe, "after all I have ſuffered; after our long, long ſeparation, when I thought I ſhould never—never ſee you more—we are ſtill to meet again! O! I have endured grief, and anxiety, and terror, and let me, then, not ſink beneath this joy!" Theſe were moments, when it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for her to feel emotions of regret, or melancholy, for any ordinary intereſts; even the reflection, that ſhe had reſigned the eſtates, which would have been a proviſion for herſelf and Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court for life, threw only a light and tranſient ſhade upon her ſpirits. The idea of Valancourt, and that ſhe ſhould ſee him ſo ſoon, alone occupied her heart.</p>
                     <p>At length the clock ſtruck twelve; ſhe opened the door to liſten, if any noiſe was in the caſtle, and heard only diſtant ſhouts of riot and laughter, echoed feebly along the gallery. She gueſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Signor and his gueſts were at the banquet. "They are now engaged for the night," ſaid ſhe; "and Valancourt will ſoon be here." Having ſoftly cloſed the door, ſhe paced the room with impatient ſteps, and often went to the caſement to liſten for the lute; but all was ſilent, and, her agitation every

moment encreaſing, ſhe was at length unable to ſupport herſelf, and ſat down by the window. Annette, whom ſhe detained, was, in the meantime, as loquacious as uſual; but Emily heard ſcarcely any thing ſhe ſaid, and having at length riſen to the caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhe diſtinguiſhed the chords of the lute, ſtruck with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive hand, and then the voice, ſhe had formerly liſtened to, accompanied it.</p>
                     <lg>
                        <l>"Now riſing love they fann'd, now pleaſing dole</l>
                        <l>They breath'd in tender muſings through the heart;</l>
                        <l>And now a graver, ſacred ſtrain they ſtole,</l>

                     </lg>
                     <p>Emily wept in doubtful joy and tenderneſs; and, when the ſtrain ceaſed, ſhe conſidered it as a ſignal, that Valancourt was about to leave the priſon. Soon after, ſhe heard ſteps in the corridor;—they were the light, quick ſteps of hope: ſhe could ſcarcely ſupport herſelf, as they approached, but opening the door of the apartment, ſhe advanced to meet Valancourt, and, in the next moment, ſunk in the arms of a ſtranger. His voice his countenance inſtantly convinced her, and ſhe fainted away.</p>
                     <p>On reviving, ſhe found herſelf ſupported by the ſtranger, who was watching over her recovery, with a countenance of ineffable tenderneſs and anxiety. She had no ſpirits for reply, or inquiry, ſhe aſked no queſtions, but burſt into tears, and diſengaged her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from his arms: when the expreſſion of his countenance changed to ſurpriſe and diſappointment, and he turned to Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovico for an explanation; Annette ſoon gave the information, which Ludovico could not. "O, ſir,!" ſaid ſhe, in a voice, interrupted with ſobs; "O, ſir! you are not the other Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier. We expected Monſieur Valancourt, but you are not he! O Ludovico! how could you deceive us ſo? my poor lady will never recover it—never!" The ſtranger, who now appeared much agitated, attempted to ſpeak, but his words faltered; and then ſtriking his hand againſt his forehead, as if in ſudden deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, he walked abruptly to the other end of the corridor.</p>
                     <p>Suddenly, Annette dried her tears, and ſpoke to Ludovico. "But, perhaps," ſaid ſhe, "after all, the other Chevalier is not this: perhaps the Chevalier Valancourt is ſtill below." Emily raiſed her head. "No," replied Ludovico, "Monſieur Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt, never was below, if this gentleman is not he," "if you ſir," ſaid Ludovico, addreſſing the ſtranger, "would but have had the goodneſs to truſt me with your name, this miſtake had been avoided." "Moſt true," replied the ſtranger, ſpeaking in
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:029378_0231_0FE0850408447C50"/>
broken Italian, "but it was of the utmoſt conſequence to me, that my name ſhould be concealed from Montoni. Madam," added he then, addreſſing Emily in French, "will you permit me to apologize for the pain I have occaſioned you, and to explain to you alone my name, and the circumſtance, which has led me into this error? I am of France;—I am your countryman;—we are met in a foreign land." Emily tried to compoſe her ſpirits, yet ſhe heſitated to grant his requeſt. At length, deſiring, that Ludovico would wait on the ſtaircaſe, and detaining Annette, ſhe told the ſtranger, that her woman underſtood very little Ital<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian, and begged he would communicate what he wiſhed to ſay in that language.—Having withdrawn to a diſtant part of the corridor, he ſaid, with a long drawn ſigh, "You, madam, are no ſtranger to me, though I am ſo unhappy as to be unknown to you.—My name is Du Pont; I am of France, of Gaſcony, your native province, and have long admired,—and, why ſhould I affect to diſguiſe it!—have long loved you." He pauſed, but, in the next moment, proceeded. "My family, madam, is prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably not unknown to you, for we lived within a few miles of La Vallee, and I have, ſometimes, had the happineſs of meeting you on viſits in the neighbourhood. I will not offend you by repeating how much you intereſted me; how much I loved to wander in the ſcenes you frequented; how often I viſited your favourite fiſhing houſe, and lamented the circumſtance, which, at that time, forbade me to reveal my paſſion. I will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain how I ſurrendered to temptation, and became poſſeſſed of a treaſure, which was to me ineſtimable; a treaſure, which I committed to your meſſenger, a few days ago, with expectations very different from my preſent ones. I will ſay nothing of theſe circumſtances, for I know they will avail me little; let me only ſupplicate from your forgiveneſs, and the picture, which I ſo unwarily returned. Your generoſity will pardon the theft, and reſtore the prize. My crime has been my puniſhment; for the portrait I ſtole has contributed to nouriſh a paſſion, which muſt ſtill be my torment."</p>
                     <p>Emily now interrupted him. "I think, ſir, I may leave it to your integrity to determine, whether, after what has juſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, concerning Monſ. Valancourt, I ought to return the picture. I think you will acknowledge, that this would not be genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; and you will allow me to add, that it would be doing my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an injuſtice. I muſt conſider myſelf honoured by your good opinion, but"—and ſhe heſitated,—"the miſtake of this even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing makes it unneceſſary for me to ſay more."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="10" facs="unknown:029378_0232_0FE0850897AFDBA8"/>
"It does, madam,—alas! it does!" ſaid the ſtranger, who, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long pauſe, proceeded.—"But you will allow me to ſhew my diſintereſtedneſs, though not my love, and will accept the ſervices I offer. Yet, alas! what ſervices can I offer? I am myſelf a priſoner, a ſufferer, like you. But, dear as liberty is to me, I would not ſeek it through half the hazards I would encounter to deliver you from this receſs of vice. Accept the offered ſervices of a friend; do not refuſe me the reward of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at leaſt, attempted to deſerve your thanks."</p>
                     <p>"You deſerve them already, ſir, "ſaid Emily; "the wiſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves my warmeſt thanks. But you will excuſe me for remind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you of the danger you incur by prolonging this interview. It will be a great conſolation to me to remember, whether your friendly attempts to releaſe me ſucceed or not, that I have a countryman, who would ſo generouſly protect me,"—Monſieur Du Pont took her hand, which ſhe but feebly attempted to withdraw, and preſſed it reſpectfully to his lips. "Allow me to breathe another fervent ſigh for your happineſs," ſaid he, "and to applaud myſelf for an affection, which I cannot conquer." As he ſaid this, Emily heard a noiſe from her apartment, and, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round, ſaw the door from the ſtaircaſe open, and a man ruſh into her chamber. "I will teach you to conquer it," cried he, as he advanced into the corridor, and drew a ſtiletto, which he aimed at Du Pont, who was unarmed, but who, ſtepping back, avoided the blow, and then ſprung upon Verezzi, from whom he wrenched the ſtiletto. While they ſtruggled in each other's graſp, Emily, followed by Annette, ran further into the corri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, calling on Ludovico, who was, however, gone from the ſtaircaſe, and, as ſhe advanced, terrified and uncertain what to do, a diſtant noiſe that ſeemed to ariſe from the hall, reminded her of the danger ſhe was incurring; and, ſending Annette for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in ſearch of Ludovico, ſhe returned to the ſpot were Du Pont and Verezzi were ſtill ſtruggling for victory. It was her own cauſe which was to be decided with that of the former, whoſe, conduct, independently of this circumſtance, would, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, have intereſted her in his ſucceſs, even had ſhe not diſliked and dreaded Verezzi. She <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> herſelf in a chair, and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated them to deſiſt from further violence, till, at length, Du Pont forced Verezzi to the floor, where he lay ſtunned by the violence of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>; and ſhe then entreated Du Pont to eſcape from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> leave her unprotected; and, while Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, new more terrified for him, than for herſelf, enforced the entreaty, they heard ſteps aſcending the private ſtaircaſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="11" facs="unknown:029378_0232_0FE0850897AFDBA8"/>
"O you are loſt!" cried ſhe, "theſe are Montoni's people." Du Pont made no reply, but ſupported Emily, while, with a ſteady, though eager, countenance, he awaited their appearance, and, in the next moment, Ludovico, alone mounted the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place. Throwing an haſty glance round the chamber, "Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me," ſaid he, "as you value your lives; we have not an inſtant to loſe!"</p>
                     <p>Emily inquired what had occurred, and whither they were to go?</p>
                     <p>"I cannot ſtay to tell you now, Signora," replied Ludovico: "ſly! ſly!"</p>
                     <p>She immediately followed him, accompanied by Monſ. Du Pont, down the ſtaircaſe, and along a vaulted paſſage, when ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſhe recollected Annette, and inquired for her. "She awaits us further on, Signora," ſaid Ludovico, almoſt breathleſs with haſte; "the gates were open, a moment ſince, to a party juſt come in from the mountains: they will be ſhut I fear before we can reach them! Through this door, Signora," added Ludo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vico, holding down the lamp, "take care, here are two ſteps." Emily followed, trembling ſtill more, than before ſhe had underſtood that her eſcape from the caſtle depended upon the preſent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; while Du Pont ſupported her, and endeavoured, as they paſſed along, to cheer her ſpirits.</p>
                     <p>"Speak low, Signor," ſaid Ludovico, "theſe paſſages ſend echoes all round the caſtle."</p>
                     <p>"Take care of the light," cried Emily, "you go ſo faſt, that the air will extinguiſh it."</p>
                     <p>Ludovico now opened another door, where they found Annette, and the party then deſcended a ſhort flight of ſteps into a paſſage, which, Ludovico ſaid, led round the inner court of the caſtle, and opened into the outer one. As they advanced, confuſed and tumultuous ſounds, that ſeemed to come from the inner court, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed Emily. "Nay, Signora," ſaid Ludovico, "our only hope is in that tumult; while the Signor's people are buſied about the men, who are juſt arrived, we may, perhaps, paſs unnoticed through the gates. But huſh!" he added, as they approached the ſmall door, that opened into the outer court, "if you will remain here a moment, I will go to ſee whether the gates are open, and any body is in the way. Pray extinguiſh the light, Signor, if you hear me talking," continued Ludovico, delivering the lamp to Du Pont, "and remain quite ſtill."</p>
                     <p>Saying this, he ſtepped out upon the court, and they cloſed the door, liſtening anxiouſly to his departing ſteps. No voice,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:029378_0233_0FE08517CD5953F0"/>
however, was heard in the court, which he was croſſing, though a confuſion of many voices yet iſſued from the inner one. "We ſhall ſoon be beyond the walls," ſaid Du Pont ſoftly to Emily, "ſupport yourſelf a little longer, Madam, and all will be well."</p>
                     <p>But ſoon they heard Ludovico ſpeaking loud, and the voice alſo of ſome other perſon, and Du Pont immediately extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the lamp. "Ah! it is too late!" exclaimed Emily, "what is to become of us?" They liſtened again, and then perceived, that Ludovico was talking with a ſentinel, whoſe voices were heard alſo by Emily's favourite dog, that had followed her from the chamber, and now barked loudly. "This dog will betray us!" ſaid Du Pont, "I will hold him." "I fear he has already betrayed us!" replied Emily. Du Pont, however, caught him up, and, again liſtening to what was going on without, they heard Ludovico ſay, "I'll watch the gates the while."</p>
                     <p>"Stay a minute, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>lied the ſentinel, "and you need not have the trouble, for the horſes will be ſent round to the outer ſtables, then the gates will be ſhut, and I can leave my poſt." "I don't mind the trouble, comrade," ſaid Ludovico, "you will do ſuch another good turn for me, ſometime. Go—go, and fetch the wine; the rogues, that are juſt come in, will drink it all elſe."</p>
                     <p>The ſoldier heſitated, and then called aloud to the people in the ſecond court, to know why they did not ſend out the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that the gates might be ſhut; but they were too much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, to attend to him, even if they had heard his voice.</p>
                     <p>"Aye—aye," ſaid Ludovico, "they know better than that; they are ſharing it all among them; if you wait till the horſes come out, you muſt wait till the wine is drunk. I have had my ſhare already, but ſince you do not care about yours, I ſee no reaſon why I ſhould not have that too."</p>
                     <p>"Hold, hold, not ſo faſt," cried the ſentinel, "do watch then, for a moment: I'll be with you preſently."</p>
                     <p>"Don't hurry yourſelf," ſaid Ludovico coolly, "I have kept guard before now. But you may leave me your trombone,<note n="*" place="bottom">A kind of Blunderbuſs.</note> that if the caſtle ſhould be attacked, you know, I may be able to defend the paſs like a hero."</p>
                     <p>"There, my, good fellow," returned the ſoldier, "there, take it—it has ſeen ſervice, though it could do little in defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the caſtle. I'll tell you a good ſtory though about this ſame trombone."</p>
                     <p>"You'll tell it better when you have had the wine," ſaid Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovico. "There! they are coming out from the court already."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="13" facs="unknown:029378_0233_0FE08517CD5953F0"/>
"I'll have the wine, though," ſaid the ſentinel, running off. "I won't keep you a minute."</p>
                     <p>"Take your time, I am in no haſte," replied Ludovico, who was already hurrying acroſs the court, when the ſoldier came back. "Whither ſo faſt, friend—whither ſo faſt?" ſaid the latter. What! is this the way you keep watch? I muſt ſtand to my poſt myſelf, I ſee."</p>
                     <p>"Aye, well," replied Ludovico, "you have ſaved me the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of following you further, for I wanted to tell you, if you have a mind to drink the Tuſcany wine you muſt go to Sebaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, he is dealing it out; the other that Federico has is not worth having. But you are not likely to have any, I ſee for they are all coming out."</p>
                     <p>"By St. Peter! ſo they are," ſaid the ſoldier, and again ran off, while Ludovico, once more at liberty haſtened to the door of the paſſage, where Emily was ſinking under the anxiety this long diſcourſe had occaſioned; but, on his telling them the court was clear, they followed him to the gates, without waiting another inſtant yet not before he had ſeized two horſes, that had ſtrayed from the ſecond court, and were picking a ſcanty meal among the graſs, which grew between the pavement of the firſt.</p>
                     <p>They paſſed, without interruption, the dreadful gates, and took the road that led down among the woods, Emily, Monſieur Du Pont and Annette on foot, and Ludovico, who was mounted on one horſe, leading the other. Having reached them they ſtopped, while Emily and Annette, were placed on horſeback with their two protectors, when, Ludovico leading the way, they ſet off as faſt as the broken road, and the feeble light, which a riſing moon threw among the foliage, would permit.</p>
                     <p>Emily was ſo much aſtoniſhed by this ſudden departure, that ſhe ſcarcely dared to believe herſelf awake; and ſhe yet much doubted whether this adventure would terminate in eſcape,—a doubt, which had too much probability to juſtify it; for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they quitted the woods, they heard ſhouts in the wind, and, on emerging from them, ſaw lights move quickly near the caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle above. Du Pont whipped his horſe, and with ſome difficulty compelled him to go faſter.</p>
                     <p>"Ah! poor beaſt," ſaid Ludovico, "he is weary enough;—he has been out all day, but, Signor, we muſt fly for it, now; for yonder are the lights coming this way."</p>
                     <p>Having given his own horſe a laſh, they now both ſet off on a full gallop; and, when they again looked back, the lights were ſo diſtant as ſcarcely to be diſcerned, and the voices were
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:029378_0234_0FE0851DFAEBDCC0"/>
ſunk into ſilence. The travellers then abated their pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>, and, conſulting whither they ſhould direct their courſe, it was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined they ſhould deſcend into Tuſcany, and endeavour to reach the Mediterranean, where they could readily embark for France. Thither Du Pont meant to attend Emily, if he ſhould learn, that the regiment he had accompanied into Italy, was returned to his native country.</p>
                     <p>They were now in the road which Emily had travelled with Ugo and Bertrand; but Ludovico, who was the only one of the party, acquainted with the paſſes of theſe mountains, ſaid, that a little further on, a bye-road, branching from this, would lead them down into Tuſcany with very little difficulty; and that, at a few leagues diſtance, was a ſmall town, where neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries could be procured for their journey.</p>
                     <p>"But, I hope," added he, "we ſhall meet with no ſtraggling parties of banditti; ſome of them are abroad, I know. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I have got a good trombone, which will be of ſome ſervice, if we ſhould encounter any of thoſe brave ſpirits. You have no arms, Signor?" "Yes," replied Du Pont, "I have the villain's ſtiletto, who would have ſtabbed me—but let us rejoice in our eſcape from Udolpho, nor torment ourſelves with looking out for dangers, that may never arrive."</p>
                     <p>The moon was now riſen high over the woods, that hung up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſides of the narrow glen, through which they wandered, and afforded them light ſufficient to diſtinguiſh their way, and to avoid the looſe and broken ſtones, that frequently croſſed it. They now travelled leiſurely, and in profound ſilence; for they had ſcarcely yet recovered from the aſtoniſhment, into which this ſudden eſcape had thrown them.—Emily's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

ſhe hoped ſhe was returning, and of her marriage with Ludovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, to which there no longer appeared any impediment, for pov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty ſhe did not conſider ſuch.

                        </gap> this affair.</p>
                     <p>Thus variouſly engaged in thought, the travellers paſſed on ſilently, for above an hour, a queſtion only being, now and then aſked by Du Pont, concerning the road, or a remark uttered by Annette, reſpecting objects ſeen imperfectly in the twilight.</p>
                     <p>At length, lights were perceived twinkling on the ſide of a mountain, and Ludovico had no doubt, that they proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the town he had mentioned, while his companions, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> this aſſurance ſunk again into ſilence. Annette was the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> who interrupted this. "Holy Peter!" ſaid ſhe, "What ſhall we do for money on our journey? for I know neither I, or my lady, have a ſingle ſequin; the Signor took care of that!"</p>
                     <p>This remark produced a ſerious inquiry, which ended in as ſerious embarraſſment, for Du Pont had been rifled of nearly all his money when he was taken priſoner; the remainder he had given to the ſentinel, who had enabled him occaſionally to leave his priſon chamber; and Ludovico, who had for ſometime found a difficulty, in procuring any part of the wages due to him, had now ſcarcely caſh ſufficient to procure neceſſary refreſhment at the firſt town, in which they ſhould arrive.</p>
                     <p>Their poverty was the more diſtreſſing, ſince it would detain them among the mountains, where, even in a town, they could ſcarcely conſider themſelves ſafe from Montoni. The travellers, however, had only to proceed and dare the future; and they continued their way through lonely wilds and duſky vallies, where the overhanging foliage now admitted, and then excluded the moonlight; wilds ſo deſolate, that they appeared, on the firſt glance, as if no human being had ever trode them before. Even the road, in which the party were, did but ſlightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict this error, for the high graſs and other luxuriant vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with which it was overgrown, told how very ſeldom the foot of a traveller had paſſed it.</p>
                     <p>At length, from a diſtance, was heard the faint tinkling of a ſheep bell; and, ſoon after, the bleat of flocks, and the party then
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:029378_0235_0FE0852CE1146240"/>
knew, that they were near ſome human habitation, for the light, which Ludovico had fancied to proceed from a town, had long been concealed by intervening mountains. Cheered by this hope, they quickened their pace along the narrow paſs they were winding, and it opened upon one of thoſe paſtoral vallies of the Apennines, which might be painted for a ſcene of Arcadia, and whoſe beauty and ſimplicity are finely contraſted by the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of the ſnow topt mountains above.</p>
                     <p>The morning light, now glimmering in the horizon, ſhewed faintly, at a little diſtance, upon the brow of a hill, which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to peep from "under the opening eyelids of the morn," the town they were in ſearch of, and which they ſoon after reached. It was not without ſome difficulty, that they there found a houſe, which could afford ſhelter for themſelves and their horſes; and Emily deſired they might not reſt longer than was neceſſary for refreſhment. Her appearance excited ſome ſurpriſe; for ſhe was without a hat, having had time only to throw on her veil before ſhe left the caſtle, a circumſtance that compelled her to regret again the want of money, without which it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to procure this neceſſary article of dreſs.</p>
                     <p>Ludovico, on examining his purſe; found it even inſufficient to ſupply preſent refreſhment, and Du Pont, at length, ventured to inform the landlord, whoſe countenance was ſimple and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of their exact ſituation, and requeſted that he would aſſiſt them to purſue their journey; a purpoſe which he promiſed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with, as far as he was able, when he learned that they were priſoners eſcaping from Montoni, whom he had too much reaſon to hate. But, though he conſented to lend them freſh horſes to carry them to the next town, he was too poor himſelf to truſt them with money, and they were again lamenting their poverty, when Ludovico who had been with his tired horſes to the hovel, which ſerved for a ſtable, entered the room, half frantic with joy, in which his auditors ſoon participated. On removing the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle from one of the horſes, he had found beneath it a ſmall bag, containing, no doubt, the booty of one of the <hi>condottieri,</hi> who had returned from a plundering excurſion, juſt before Ludovico left the caſtle, and whoſe horſe having ſtrayed from the inner court, while his maſter was engaged in drinking, had brought away the treaſure, which the ruffian had conſidered the reward of his exploit.</p>
                     <p>On counting over this, Du Pont found that it would be more than ſufficient to carry them all to France, where he now deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to accompany Emily, whether he ſhould obtain intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:029378_0235_0FE0852CE1146240"/>
of his regiment, or not; for, though he had as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the integrity of Ludovico, as his ſmall knowledge of him allowed, he could not endure the thought of committing her to his care for the voyage; nor, perhaps, had he re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>olution enough to deny himſelf the dangerous pleaſure, which he might derive from her preſence.</p>
                     <p>He now conſulted them, concerning the ſea port, to which they ſhould direct their way, and Ludovico, better informed of the geography of the country, ſaid, that Leghorn was the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt port of conſequence, which Du Pont knew alſo to be the moſt likely of any in Italy to aſſiſt their plan, ſince from thence veſſels of all nations were continually departing. Thither, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it was determined, that they ſhould proceed.</p>
                     <p>Emily, having purchaſed a little ſtraw hat, ſuch as was worn by the peaſant girls of Tuſcany, and ſome other little neceſſary equipments for the journey, and the travellers, having exchanged their tired horſes for others better able to carry them, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced their joyous way, as the ſun was riſing over the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and, after travelling through this romantic country, for ſeveral hours, began to deſcend into the vale of Arno. And here Emily beheld all the charms of ſylvan and paſtoral landſcape united, adorned with the elegant villas of the Florentine nobles, and diverſified with the various riches of cultivation. How vived the ſhrubs, that embowered the ſlopes, with the woods, that ſtretched amphitheatrically along the mountains! and, above all, how elegant the outline of theſe waving Apennines, now ſoften<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the wildneſs, which their interior regions exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed! At a diſtance, in the eaſt, Emily diſcovered Florence, with its towers riſing on the brilliant horizon, and its luxuriant plain, ſpreading to the feet of the Apennines, ſpeckled with gardens and magnificent villas, or coloured with groves of orange and lemon, with vines, corn, and plantations of olives and mulberry; while, to the weſt, the vale opened to the waters of the Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean, ſo diſtant, that they were known only by a blueiſh line that appeared upon the horizon, and by the light marine vapour, which juſt ſtained the aether above.</p>
                     <p>With a full heart, Emily hailed the waves, that were to bear her back to her native country, the remembrance of which however, brought with it a pang; for ſhe had there no home to receive, no parents to welcome her, but was going, like a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn pilgrim, to weep over the ſad ſpot, where he, who <hi>was</hi> her father, lay interred. Nor were ſpirits cheered, when ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered how long it would probably be before ſhe ſhould ſee Valancourt, who might be ſtationed with his regiment in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:029378_0236_0FE085319C2162B0"/>
part of France, and that, when they did meet, it would be only to lament the ſucceſsful villainy of Montoni; yet, ſtill ſhe would have felt inexpreſſible delight at the thought of being once more in the ſame country with Valancourt, had it even been certain, that ſhe could not ſee him.</p>
                     <p>The intenſe heat, for it was now noon, obliged the travellers to look out for a ſhady receſs, where they might reſt, for a few hours, and the neighbouring thickets abounding with wild grapes, raſberries, and figs, promiſed them grateful refreſhment. Soon after, they turned from the road into a grove, whoſe thick foliage entirely excluded the ſunbeams, and where a ſpring guſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a rock, gave coolneſs to the air; and, having alighted and turned the horſes to graze, Annette and Ludovico, ran to gather fruit from the ſurrounding thickets, of which they ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned withan abundance. The travellers ſeated under the ſhade of a pine and cypreſs grove and on turf, enriched with ſuch a profuſion of fragrant flowers, as Emily had ſcarcely ever ſeen, even among the Pyrennees, took their ſimple repaſt, and viewed, with new delight, beneath the dark umbrage of gigantic pines, the glowing landſcape ſtretching to the ſea.</p>
                     <p>Emily and Du Pont gradually became thoughtful and ſilent; but Annette was all joy and loquacity, and Ludovico was gay, without forgetting the reſpectful diſtance, which was due to his companions. The repaſt being over, Du Pont recommended Emily to endeavour to ſleep, during theſe ſultry hours, and deſiring the ſervants would do the ſame, ſaid he would watch the while; but Ludovico wiſhed to ſpare him this trouble; and Emily and Annette wearied with travelling, tried to repoſe, while he ſtood guard with his trombone.</p>
                     <p>When Emily, refreſhed by ſlumber, awoke, ſhe found the ſentinel aſleep on his poſt and Du Pont awake, but loſt in melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly thought. As the ſun was yet too high to allow them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue their journey, and as it was neceſſary, that Ludovico, after the toils and trouble he had ſuffered, ſhould finiſh his ſleep, Emily took this opportunity of inquiring by what accident Du Pont became Montoni's priſoner, and he, pleaſed with the intereſt this inquiry expreſſed and with the excuſe it gave him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

remembered, that Madame Cheron, your aunt, had married an Italian of that name, and that you had accompanied them into Italy. It was not, however, till ſometime after, that I became convinced this was the ſame Montoni, or learned, that you madam, was under the ſame roof with myſelf. I will not pain you by deſcribing what were my emotions upon this diſcovery, which I owed to a ſentinel, whom I had ſo far won to my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, that he granted me many indulgencies, one of which was very important to me, and ſomewhat dangerous to himſelf: but he perſiſted in refuſing to convey any letter, or notice of my ſituation to you, for he juſtly dreaded a diſcovery and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent vengeance of Montoni. He however enabled me to ſee you more than once. You are ſurpriſed, madam, and I will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain myſelf. My health and ſpirits ſuffered extremely from want of air and exerciſe, and, at length, I gained ſo far upon the pity, or the avarice of the man, that he gave me the means of walking on the terrace."</p>
                     <p>Emily now liſtened, with very anxious attention, to the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of Du Pont, who proceeded:</p>
                     <p>"In granting this indulgence, he knew, that he had nothing to apprehend from a chance of my eſcaping from a caſtle, which was vigilantly guarded, and the neareſt terrace of which roſe over a perpendicular rock; he ſhewed me alſo," continued Du Pont, "a door concealed in the cedar wainſcot of the apartment where I was confined, which he inſtructed me how to open; and which, leading into a paſſage, formed within the thickneſs of the wall, that extended far along the caſtle, finally opened in an obſcure corner of the eaſtern rampart. I have ſince been informed, that there are many paſſages of the ſame kind concealed within the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious walls of that edifice, and which were, undoubtedly contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the purpoſe of facilitating eſcapes in time of war. Through this avenue, at the dead of night, I often ſtole to the terrace, where I walked with the utmoſt caution, leſt my ſteps ſhould betray me to the ſentinels on duty in diſtant parts; for this end of it, being guarded by high buildings, was not watched by ſoldiers. In one of theſe midnight wanderings, I ſaw light in a caſement that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked the rampart, and which, I obſerved, was immediately over my priſon chamber. It occurred to me, that you might be in that apartment, and, with the hope, of ſeeing you, I placed my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf oppoſite to the window."</p>
                     <p>Emily, remembering the figure that had formerly appeared on the terrace, and which had occaſioned her ſo much anxiety, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, "It was you then, Monſieur Du Pont, who occaſioned

me much fooliſh terror; my ſpirits were, at that time, ſo much weakened by long ſuffering, that they took alarm at every hint." Du Pont, after lamenting, that he had occaſioned her any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, added, "As I reſted on the wall, oppoſite to your caſement, the conſideration of your melancholy ſituation, and of my own, called from me involuntary ſounds of lamentation, which drew you, I fancy to the caſement; I ſaw there a perſon, whom I believed to be you. O! I will ſay nothing of my emotion at that moment; I wiſhed to ſpeak, but prudence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained me, till the diſtant footſtep of a ſentinel compelled me ſuddenly to quit my ſtation.</p>
                     <p>"It was ſometime, before I had another opportunity of wal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for I could only leave my priſon, when it happened to be the turn of one man to guard me; meanwhile, I became con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced from ſome circumſtances related by him, that your apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was over-mine, and, when again I ventured forth, I return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to your caſement, where again I ſaw you, but without dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſpeak. I waved my hand, and you ſuddenly diſappear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; then it was, that I forgot my prudence, and yielded to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation; again you appeared—you ſpoke—I heard the well known accent of your voice! and, at that moment, my diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would have forſaken me again, had I not heard alſo the approaching ſteps of a ſoldier, when I inſtantly quitted the place, though not before the man had ſeen me. He followed down the terrace and gained ſo faſt upon me, that I was compelled to make uſe of a ſtratagem, ridiculous enough, to ſave myſelf. I had heard of the ſuperſtition of many of theſe men, and I ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered a ſtrange noiſe, with a hope, that my purſuer would miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it for ſomething ſupernatural, and deſiſt from purſuit. Luckily for myſelf I ſucceeded; the man, it ſeems, was ſubject to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

A ſenſe of the danger I had eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped, and the increaſed watchfulneſs, which my apearance had occaſioned among the ſentinels, deterred me ever after from walking on the terrace; but, in the ſtillneſs of night, I fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently beguiled myſelf with an old lute, procured for me by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

"Yes," ſaid Emily, with an involuntary ſigh, "you was right indeed."</p>
                     <p>Du Pont, obſerving the painful emotions, which this queſtion revived, now changed the ſubject. "In one of my excurſions through the paſſage, which I have mentioned, I overheard a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular converſation." ſaid he.</p>
                     <p>"In the paſſage!" ſaid Emily, with ſurpriſe.</p>
                     <p>"I heard it in the paſſage, ſaid Du Pont, "but it proceeded from an apartment, adjoining the wall, within which the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage wound, and the ſhell of the wall was there ſo thin, and was alſo ſomewhat decayed, that I could diſtinctly hear every word ſpoken, on the other ſide. It happened that Montoni and his companions were aſſembled in the room, and Montoni began to relate the extraordinary hiſtory of the lady, his predeceſſor in the caſtle. He did, indeed, mention ſome very ſurpriſing cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and whether they were ſtrictly true, his conſcience muſt decide; I fear it will determine againſt him. But you, madam, have doubtleſs heard the report, which he deſigns ſhould circulate, on the ſubject of that lady's myſterious fate."</p>
                     <p>"I have, ſir," replied Emily, "and I perceive, that you doubt it."</p>
                     <p>"I doubted it before the period I am ſpeaking of," rejoined Du Pont;—"but ſome circumſtances mentioned by Montoni, greatly contributed to my ſuſpicions. The account I then heard, almoſt convinced me, that he was a murderer. I trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for you;—the more ſo that I had heard the gueſts mention your name in a manner, that threatened your repoſe; and, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the moſt impious men are often the moſt ſuperſtitious, I determined to try whether I could not awaken their conſciences, and awe them from the commiſſion of the crime I dreaded. I liſtened cloſely to Montoni, and, in the moſt ſtriking paſſages of his ſtory, I joined my voice, and repeated his laſt words in a diſguiſed and hollow tone."</p>
                     <p>"But was you not afraid of being diſcovered?" ſaid Emily.</p>
                     <p>"I was not," replied Du Pont; "for I knew, that, if Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni had been acquainted with the ſecret of this paſſage, he would not have confined me in the apartment, to which it led. I knew alſo, from better authority, that he was ignorant of it. The party, for ſometime, appeared inattentive to my voice; but, at length, were ſo much alarmed, that they quitted the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment; and, having heard Montoni order his ſervants to ſearch it, I returned to my priſon, which was very diſtant from this part of the paſſage." "I remember perfectly to have heard
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:029378_0238_0FE085477ACDB9E8"/>
of the converſation you mention," ſaid Emily; "it ſpread a general alarm among Montoni's people, and I will own I was weak enough to partake of it."</p>
                     <p>Monſieur Du Pont and Emily thus continued to converſe of Montoni, and then of France, and of the plan to their voyage; when Emily told him, that it was her intention to retire to a convent in Languedoc, where ſhe had been formerly treated with much kindneſs, and from thence to write to her relation Monſieur Queſnel, and inform him of her conduct. There, ſhe deſigned to wait, till La Vallee ſhould again be her own, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe hoped her income would ſometime permit her to return, for Du Pont now taught her to expect, that the eſtate of which Montoni had attempted to defraud her was not irrecoverably loſt, and he again congratulated her on her eſcape from Montoni, who, he had not a doubt, meant to have detained her for life. The poſſibility of recovering her aunt's eſtates for Valancourt and herſelf lighted up a joy in Emily's heart, ſuch as ſhe had not known for many months; but ſhe endeavoured to conceal this from Monſieur Du Pont, leſt it ſhould lead him to a painful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his rival.</p>
                     <p>They continued to converſe, till the ſun was declining in the weſt, when Du Pont awoke Ludovico, and they ſet forward on their journey. Gradually deſcending the lower ſlopes of the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, they reached the Arno, and wound along its paſtoral mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, for many miles, delighted with the ſcenery around them, and with the remembrances, which its claſſic waves revived. At a diſtance, they heard the gay ſong of the peaſants among the vineyards, and obſerved the ſetting ſun tint the waves with yellow luſtre, and twilight draw a duſky purple over the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, which, at length, deepened into night.

As they approached it, the vale expanded into a plain, variegated with vineyards, corn, olives and mulberry groves; but it was late, before they reached its gates, where Emily was ſurpriſed to hear the buſy ſound of footſteps and the tones of muſical inſtruments, as well as to ſee the lively groups, that filled the ſtreets, and ſhe almoſt fancied herſelf again at Venice; but here was no moonlight ſea—no gay gondolas, daſhing the waves,—no <hi>

As ſoon as Emily had reached the inn, he went therefore to the quay, to make his inquiries; but after all the endeavours of himſelf and Ludovico, they could hear of no bark, deſtined immediately for France, and the travellers returned to their reſting place. Here alſo, Du Pont endeavoured to learn where his regiment then lay, but could ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire no information concerning it. The travellers retired ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reſt, after the fatigues of this day; and, on the following, roſe early, and, without pauſing to view the celebrated antiquities of the place, or the wonders of its hanging tower, purſued their journey in the cooler hours, through a charming country, rich with wine, and corn and oil. The Apennines, no longer awful, or even grand, here ſoftened into the beauty of ſylvan and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral landſcape; and Emily, as ſhe deſcended them, looked down delighted on Leghorn, and its ſpacious bay, filled with veſſels, and crowned with theſe beautiful hills.</p>
                     <p>She was no leſs ſurpriſed and amuſed, on entering this town, to find it crowded with perſons in the dreſſes of all nations; a ſcene which reminded her of a Venetian maſquerade, ſuch as ſhe had witneſſed at the time of the Carnival; but here, was buſtle, without gaiety, and noiſe inſtead of muſic, while elegance was to be looked for only in the waving outlines of the ſurrounding hills.</p>
                     <p>Monſieur Du Pont, immediately on their arrival, went down to the quay, where he heard of ſeveral French veſſels, and of one that was to ſail in a few days for Marſeilles, from whence another veſſel could be procured, without difficulty, to take them acroſs the gulf

of Lyons towards Narbonne, on the coaſt not many leagues from which city he underſtood the convent was ſeated, to which Emily wiſhed to retire. He, therefore, immediately engaged with the captain to take them to Marſeilles, and Emily was delighted to hear, that her paſſage to France was ſecured. Her mind was now relieved from the terror of purſuit, and the pleaſing hope of ſoon ſeeing her native country—that country which held Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court, reſtored to her ſpirits a degree of cheerfulneſs, ſuch as ſhe had ſcarcely known, ſince the death of her father. At Leghorn alſo, Du Pont heard of his regiment, and that it had embarked for France; a circumſtance, which gave him great ſatisfaction, for he could now accompany Emily thither, without reproach to his conſcience, or apprehenſion of diſpleaſure from his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. During theſe days, he ſcrupulouſly forbore to diſtreſs her by a mention of his paſſion, and ſhe was compelled to eſteem and pity, though ſhe could not love him. He endeavoured to amuſe her by ſhewing the environs of the town, and they often walked together on the ſea ſhore, and on the buſy quays, where Emily was frequently intereſted by the arrival and departure of veſſels, participating in the joy of meeting friends, and, ſometimes, ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a ſympathetic tear to the ſorrow of thoſe, that were ſeparat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It was after having witneſſed a ſcene of the latter kind, that ſhe arranged the following ſtanzas:</p>

                     <p>WE now return to Languedoc and to the mention of Count De Villefort, the nobleman, who ſucceeded to an eſtate of the Marquis De Villeroi, ſituated near the monaſtery of St. Claire. It may be recollected, that this chateau was uninhabited, when St. Aubert and his daughter were in the neighbourhood, and that the former was much affected on diſcovering himſelf to be ſo near Chateau-le-Blanc, a place, concerning which the good old La V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>It was in the year 1584, the beginning of that, in which St. Aubert died, that Francis Beauveau, Count De Villefort, came into poſſeſſion of the manſion and extenſive domain called Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau-le-Blanc, ſituated in the province of Languedoc, on the ſhore of the Mditerranean. This eſtate, which, during ſome centuries, had belonged to his family, now deſcended to him, on the deceaſe of his relative, the Marquis De Villeroi, who had been latterly a man of reſerved manners and auſtere character; cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, which, together with the duties of his profeſſion, that often called him into the field, had prevented any degree of inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy with his couſin, the Count De Villefort. For many years, they had known little of each other, and the Count received the firſt intelligence of his death, which happened in a diſtant part of France, together with the inſtruments, that gave him poſſeſſion of the domain Chateau-le-Blanc; but it was not till the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing year, that he determined to viſit that eſtate, when he deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to paſs the autumn there.

                     <p>During many years, the Chateau had been abandoned by the late Marquis, and, being inhabited only by an old ſteward and his wife, had been ſuffered to fall much into decay. To ſuperintend the repairs, that would be requiſite to make it a comfortable reſidence, had been a principal motive with the Count for paſſing the Autumnal months in Languedoc; and neither the remonſtrances, or the tears of the Counteſs, for, on urgent occaſions, ſhe could weep, were powerful enough to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his determination. She prepared, therefore, to obey the command which ſhe could not conquer, and to reſign the gay aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of Paris,—where her beauty was generally unrivalled and won the applauſe, to which her wit had but feeble claim—for the twilight canopy of woods, the lonely grandeur of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and the ſolemnity of gothic halls and of long, long galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which echoed only the ſolitary ſtep of a domeſtic, or the meaſured clink, that aſcended from the great clock—the ancient monitor of the hall below. From theſe melancholy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations ſhe endeavoured to relieve her ſpirits by recollecting all that ſhe had ever heard, concerning the joyous vintage of the plains of Languedoc; but there, alas! no airy forms would bound to the gay melody of Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>The Count had a ſon and a daughter, the children of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer marriage, who, he deſigned, ſhould accompany him to the ſouth of France; Henri, who was in his twentieth year, was in the French ſervice; and Blanche, who was not yet eighteen, had been hitherto confined to the convent, where ſhe had been placed immediately on her father's ſecond marriage. The preſent Counteſs, who had neither ſufficient ability or inclination to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintend the education of her daughter-in-law, had adviſed this ſtep, and the dread of ſuperior beauty had ſince urged her to employ every art, that might prevail on the Count to prolong the period of Blanche's ſecluſion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>On the morning which commenced the journey, the poſtillions ſtopped at the convent, by the Count's order, to take up Blanche,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:029378_0241_0FE0856C3076CCA0"/>
whoſe heart beat with delight, at the proſpect of novelty and freedom now before her. As the time of her departure drew nigh, her impatience had increaſed, and the laſt night, during which ſhe counted every note of every hour, had appeared the moſt tedious of any ſhe had ever known. The morning light, at length, dawned; the matin bell rang; ſhe heard the nuns deſcending from their chambers, and ſhe ſtarted from a ſleepleſs pillow to welcome the day, which was to emancipate her from the ſeverities of a cloiſter, and introduce her to a world, where pleaſure was ever ſmiling, and goodneſs ever bleſſed—where, in ſhort nothing but pleaſure and goodneſs reigned! When the bell of the great gate rang, and the ſound was followed by that of carriage wheels, ſhe ran, with a palpitating heart, to her lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and perceiving her father's carriage in the court below, danced, with airy ſteps, along the gallery, where ſhe was met by a nun with a ſummons from the abbeſs. In the next moment, ſhe was in the parlour, and in the preſence of the Counteſs, who now appeared to her as an angel, that was to lead her into hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. But the emotions of the Counteſs, on beholding her, were not in uniſon with thoſe of Blanche, who had never appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo lovely as at this moment, when her countenance, animated by the lightning ſmile of joy, glowed with the beauty of happy innocence.</p>
                     <p>After converſing for a few minutes with the abbeſs, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs roſe to go. This was the moment, which Blanche had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated with ſuch eager expectation, the ſummit from which ſhe looked down upon the fairy land of happineſs, and ſurveyed all its enchantment; was it a moment, then, for tears of regret? Yet it was ſo. She turned, with an altered and dejected coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, to her young companions, who were come to bid her farewel, and wept! Even my lady abbeſs, ſo ſtately and ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn, ſhe ſaluted with a degree of ſorrow, which, an hour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſhe would have believed it impoſſible to feel, and which may be accounted for by conſidering how reluctantly we all part even with unpleaſing objects, when the ſeparation is conſciouſly for ever. Again ſhe kiſſed the poor nuns and then followed the Counteſs from that ſpot with tears, which ſhe expected to leave only with ſmiles.</p>
                     <p>But the preſence of her father and the variety of objects, on the road, ſoon engaged her attention, and diſſipated <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, which tender regret had thrown upon her ſpirits. Inattentive to a converſation, which was paſſing between the Counteſs and a Mademoiſelle Bearn, her friend, Blanche ſat, loſt in pleaſing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie,

as ſhe watched the clouds floating ſilently along the blue expanſe, now veiling the ſun and ſtretching their ſhadows along the diſtant ſcene, and then diſcloſing all his brightneſs. The journey continued to give Blanche inexpreſſible delight, for new ſcenes of nature were every inſtant opening to her view, and her fancy became ſtored with gay and beautiful imagery.</p>
                     <p>It was on the evening of the ſeventh day, that the travellers came within view of Chateau-le-Blanc, the romantic beauty of whoſe ſituation ſtrongly impreſſed the imagination of Blanche, who obſerved, with ſublime aſtoniſhment, the Pyrenean moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, which had been ſeen only at a diſtance during the day, now riſing within a few leagues, with the wild cliffs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe precipices, which the evening clouds, floating round them now diſcloſed, and again veiled. The ſetting rays, that tinged their ſnowy ſummits with a roſeate hue, touched their lower points with various colouring, while the blueiſh tint, that pervad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their ſhadowy receſſes, gave the ſtrength of contraſt to the ſplendour of light. The plains of Languedoc, bluſhing with the purple vine and diverſified with groves of mulberry, almond and olives, ſpread far to the north and the eaſt; to the ſouth, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared the Mediterranean, clear as cryſtal, and blue as the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens it reflected, bearing on its boſom veſſels, whoſe white ſails caught the ſunbeams, and gave animation to the ſcene. On a high promontory, waſhed by the waters of the Mediterranean, ſtood her father's manſion, almoſt ſecluded from the eye by woods of intermingled pine, oak and cheſnut, which crowned the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, and ſloped towards the plains, on one ſide; while on the other, they extended to a conſiderable diſtance along the ſea ſhores.</p>
                     <p>As Blanche, drew nearer, the gothic features of this ancient manſion ſucceſſively appeared—firſt an embattled turret, riſing above the trees—then the broken arch of an immenſe gateway, retiring beyond them; and ſhe almoſt fancied herſelf approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a caſtle, ſuch as is often celebrated in early ſtory, where the knights look out from the battlements on ſome champion below, who, clothed in black armour, comes with his compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, to reſcue the fair lady of his love from the oppreſſion of his rival; a ſort of legends, to which ſhe had once or twice obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed acceſs in the library of her convent, that like many others, belonging to the monks, was ſtored with theſe reliques of ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic fiction.</p>
                     <p>The carriages ſtopped at a gate, which led into the domain of the chateau, but which was now faſtened; and the great bell,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:029378_0242_0FE08570D587EEB0"/>
that had formerly ſerved to announce the arrival of ſtrangers, having long ſince fallen from its ſtation, a ſervant climbed over a ruined part of the adjoining wall, to give notice to thoſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in of the arrival of their lord.</p>
                     <p>As Blanche leaned from the coach window, ſhe reſigned her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the ſweet and gentle emotions, which the hour and the ſcenery awakened, the ſun had now left the earth, and twilight began to darken the mountains; while the diſtant waters, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting the bluſh that ſtill glowed in the weſt, appeared like a line of light, ſkirting the horizon. The low murmur of waves, breaking on the ſhore, came in the breeze, and, now and then, the melancholy daſhing of oars was feebly heard from a diſtance. She was ſuffered to indulge her penſive mood, for the thoughts of the reſt of the party were ſilently engaged upon the ſubjects of their ſeveral intereſts. Meanwhile, the Counteſs, reflecting with regret, upon the gay parties ſhe had left at Paris, ſurveyed with diſguſt what ſhe thought the gloomy woods and ſolitary wildneſs of the ſcene; and, ſhrinking from the proſpect of being ſhut up in an old caſtle, was prepared to meet every object with diſpleaſure. The feelings of Henri were ſomewhat ſimilar to thoſe of the Counteſs; he gave a mournful ſigh to the delights of the capital, and to the remembrance of a lady, who, he believed, had engaged his affections, and who had certainly faſcinated his imagination; but the ſurrounding country, and the mode of life, on which he was entertaining, had, for him, at leaſt, the charm of novelty, and his regret was ſoftened by the gay expectations of youth.</p>
                     <p>The gates being at length unbarred, the carriage moved ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on, under ſpreading cheſnuts, that almoſt excluded the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of day, following what had been formerly a road, but which now overgrown with luxuriant vegetation, could be traced only by the boundary, formed by trees, on either ſide, and which wound for near half a mile among the woods, before it reached the chateau. This was the very avenue that St. Aubert and Emily had formerly entered, on their firſt arrival in the neighbourhood, with the hope of finding a houſe that would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, for the night, and had ſo abruptly quitted, on per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the wildneſs of the place, and a figure, which the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillion had fancied was a robber.</p>
                     <p>"What a diſmal place is this!" exclaimed the Counteſs, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> the carriage penetrated the deeper receſſes of the woods. "Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my lord, you do not mean to paſs all the autumn in this bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous ſpot! one ought to bring hither a cup of the waters of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"I ſhall be governed by circumſtances, madam," ſaid the Count, "this barbarous ſpot was inhabited by my anceſtors."</p>
                     <p>The carriage now ſtopped at the chateau, where at the door of the great hall appeared the old ſteward and the Pariſian ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, who had been ſent to prepare the chateau, waiting to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their lord. Lady Blanche now perceived, that the edifice was not built entirely in the gothic ſtyle, but that it had addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a more modern date; the large and gloomy hall, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, into which ſhe now entered, was entirely gothic, and ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous tapeſtry, which it was now too dark to diſtinguiſh, hung upon the walls, and depictured ſcenes from ſome of the ancient Provencal romances. A vaſt gothic window, embroidered with <hi>clematis</hi> and eglantine, that aſcended to the ſouth, led the eye, now that the caſements were thrown open, through this verdant ſhade, over a ſloping lawn, to the top<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> of dark woods, that hung upon the brow of the promontory. Beyond, appeared the waters of the Mediterranean, ſtretching far to the ſouth, and to the eaſt, where they were loſt in the horizon; while, to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt, they were bounded by the luxuriant ſhores of Languedoc and Provence, enriched with wood, and gay with vines and ſlop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſtures; and to the ſouth-weſt by the majeſtic Pyrenees, now fading from the eye, beneath the gradual gloom.</p>
                     <p>Blanche, as ſhe croſſed the hall, ſtopped a moment to obſerve this lovely proſpect, which the evening twilight obſcured, yet did not conceal. But ſhe was quickly awakened from the compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent delight, which this ſcene had diffuſed upon her mind, by the Counteſs, who diſcontented with every object around, and impatient for refreſhment and repoſe, haſtened forward to a large parlour, whoſe cedar wainſcot, narrow, pointed caſements, and dark ceiling of carved cypreſs wood, gave it an aſpect of peculiar gloom, which the dingy green velvet of the chairs and couches, fringed with tarniſhed gold, had once been deſigned to enliven,</p>
                     <p>While the Counteſs inquired for refreſhment, the Count, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by his ſon, went to look over ſome part of the chateau, and Lady Blanche reluctantly remained to witneſs the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and ill humour of her ſtep-mother.</p>
                     <p>"How long have you lived in this deſolate place?" ſaid her ladyſhip, to the old houſe keeper, who came to pay her duty. "A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove twenty years, your ladyſhip, on the next feaſt of St. Jerome."</p>
                     <p>"How happened it, that you have lived here ſo long, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt alone, too? I underſtood, that the chateau, had been ſhut up for ſome years?"</p>

The place is ſo large and has of late been ſo lonely, that we were loſt in it, and, after ſometime, we went to live in a cottage at the end of the woods, near ſome of the tenants, and came to look after the chateau, every now and then. When my lord returned to France from the wars, he took a diſlike to the place, and never came to live here again, and ſo he was ſatisfied with our remaining at the cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Alas—alas! how the chateau is changed from what it once was! What delight my late lady uſed to take in it! I well remember when ſhe came here a bride, and how fine it was.—Now, it has been neglected ſo long, and is gone into ſuch decay! I ſhall never ſee thoſe days again!"</p>
                     <p>The Counteſs appearing to be ſomewhat offended by the thoughtleſs ſimplicity, with which the old woman regretted for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, Dorothee added—"But the chateau will now be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited, and cheerful again; not all the world could tempt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"Well, the experiment will not be made, I believe," ſaid the Counteſs, diſpleaſed that her own ſilence had been unable to awe the loquacity of this ruſtic old houſe keeper, now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> he had been viewing part of the chateau, and found, that it would require conſiderable repairs and ſome alterations, before it would be perfectly comfortable, as a place of reſidence. "I am ſorry to hear it, my lord," replied the Counteſs. "And why ſorry, madam?" "Becauſe the place will ill repay your trouble; and were it even a paradiſe, it would be Inſufferable at ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from Paris."</p>
                     <p>The Count made no reply, but walked abruptly to a window. "There are windows, my lord, but they neither admit enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, or light; they ſhew only a ſcene of ſavage nature."</p>
                     <p>"I am at a loſs, madam," ſaid the Count, "to conjecture what you mean by ſavage nature. Do thoſe plains, or thoſe woods, or that fine expanſe of water, deſerve the name?"</p>

                     <p>Lady Blanche it being not yet dark, took this opportunity of exploring new ſcenes, and leaving the parlour, ſhe paſſed from the hall into a wide gallery, whoſe walls were decorated by marble pilaſters, which ſupported an arched roof, compoſed of a rich mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Through a diſtant window, that ſeemed to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the gallery, were ſeen the purple clouds of evening and a landſcape, whoſe features, thinly veiled in twilight, no longer appeared diſtinctly, but, blended into one grand maſs, ſtretched to the horizon, coloured only with a tint of ſolemn grey.</p>
                     <p>The gallery terminated in a ſaloon, to which the window ſhe had ſeen through an open door, belonged; but the increaſing duſk permitted her only an imperfect view of this apartment, which ſeemed to be magnificent and of modern architecture; though it had been either ſuffered to fall into decay, or had never been properly finiſhed. The windows, which were numerous and large, deſcended low, and afforded a very extenſive, and what Blanche's fancy repreſented to be, a very lovely proſpect; and ſhe ſtood for ſometime, ſurveying the grey obſcurity, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picturing imaginary woods and mountains, vallies and rivers, on this ſcene of night; her ſolemn ſenſations rather aſſiſted, than interrupted, by the diſtant bark of a watch dog, and by the breeze, as it trembled upon the light foliage of the ſhrubs. Now and then appeared for a moment, among the woods, a cottage light; and, at length, was heard, afar off, the evening bell of a convent, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

When ſhe withdrew her thoughts from theſe ſubjects of fanciful delight, the gloom and ſilence of the ſaloon ſomewhat awed her; and, having ſought the door of the gallery, and purſued, for a conſiderable time, a dark paſſage, ſhe came to a hall, but one totally different from that ſhe had formerly ſeen. By the twilight, admitted through an open portico, ſhe could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>The ſoft and ſhadowy tint, that overſpread the ſcene, the waves, undulating in the moonlight, and their low and meaſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed murmurs on the beach, were circumſtances, that united to elevate the unaccuſtomed mind of Blanche to enthuſiaſm.</p>
                     <p>"And have I lived in this glorious world ſo long," ſaid ſhe, "and never till now beheld ſuch a proſpect—never experienced theſe delights! Every peaſant girl, on my father's domain, has viewed from her infancy the face of nature; has ranged, at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, her romantic wilds, while I have been ſhut in a cloiſter from the view of theſe beautiful appearances, which were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to enchant all eyes, and awaken all hearts. How can the poor nuns and friars feel the full fervour of devotion, if they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee the ſun riſe, or ſet? Never, till this evening, did I know what true devotion is; for, never before did I ſee the ſun ſink below the vaſt earth! To-morrow, for the firſt time in my life, I will ſee it riſe. O who would live in Paris, to look upon black walls, and dirty ſtreets, when, in the country, they might gaze on the blue heavens, and all the green earth!"</p>
                     <p>This enthuſiaſtic ſoliloquy was interrupted by a ruſtling noiſe in the hall; and, while the lonelineſs of the place made her ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to fear, ſhe thought ſhe perceived ſomething moving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the pillars. For a moment ſhe continued ſilently obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, till aſhamed of her ridiculous apprehenſions, ſhe recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected courage enough to demand who was there. "O my young lady, is it you?" ſaid the old houſekeeper, who was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"No, not frightened, ma'amſelle," replied Dorothee, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

ceaſed to count the years! The place, to my mind has mourned ever ſince, and I am ſure my lord's vaſſals have! But you have loſt yourſelf, ma'amſelle,—ſhall I ſhew you to the other ſide of the chateau?"</p>
                     <p>Blanche inquired how long this part of the edifice had been built. "Soon after my lord's marriage, ma'am," replied Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rothee. "The place was large enough without this addition, for many rooms of the old building were even then never made uſe of, and my lord had a princely houſehold too; but he thought the ancient manſion gloomy, and gloomy enough it is!" Lady Blanche now deſired to be ſhewn to the inhabited part of the chateau; and, as the paſſages were intirely dark, Dorothee conducted her along the edge of the lawn to the oppoſite ſide of the edifice, where a door opening into the great hall, ſhe was met by Mademoiſelle Bearn. "Where have you been ſo long?" ſaid ſhe, "I had begun to think ſome wonderful adventure had befallen you, and that the giant of this enchanted caſtle, or the ghoſt, which, no doubt, haunts it, had conveyed you through a trap-door into ſome ſubterranean vault, whence you was never to return."</p>
                     <p>"No," replied Blanche, laughingly, "you ſeem to love ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures ſo well, that I leave them for you to achieve."</p>
                     <p>"Well, I am willing to achieve them, provided I am allowed to deſcribe them."</p>
                     <p>"My dear Mademoiſelle Bearn," ſaid Henri, as he met her at the door of the parlour, "no ghoſt of theſe days would be ſo ſavage as to impoſe ſilence on you. Our ghoſts are more civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized than to condemn a lady to a purgatory ſeverer even than their own, be it what it may."</p>
                     <p>Mademoiſelle Bearn replied only by a laugh; and the Count now entering the room, ſupper was ſerved, during which he ſpoke little, frequently appeared to be abſtracted from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and more than once remarked, that the place was greatly altered, ſince he had laſt ſeen it. "Many years have intervened ſince that period," ſaid he; "and, though the grand features of the ſcenery admit of no change, they impreſs me with ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions very different from thoſe I formerly experienced."</p>
                     <p>"Did theſe ſcenes, ſir," ſaid Blanche, "ever appear more lovely, than they do now? To me this ſeems hardly poſſible." The Count, regarding her with a melancholy ſmile, ſaid, they once were as delightful to me, as they are now to you; the landſcape is not changed, but time has changed me; from my mind the illuſion, which gave ſpirit to the colouring of nature, is fading faſt! If you live, my dear Blanche, to reviſit this
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:029378_0245_0FE08591D27ABA68"/>
ſpot, at the diſtance of many years, you will, perhaps, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and underſtand the feelings of your father."</p>
                     <p>Lady Blanche, affected by theſe words, remained ſilent; ſhe looked forward to the period, which the Count anticipated, and conſidering, that he who now ſpoke, would then probably be no more, her eyes bent to the ground, were filled with tears.—She gave her hand to her father, who ſmiling affectionately, roſe from his chair, and went to a window to conceal his emotion.</p>
                     <p>The fatigues of the day made the party ſeparate at an early hour, when Blanche retired through a long oak gallery to her chamber, whoſe ſpacious and lofty walls, high antiquated caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and, what was the effect of theſe, its gloomy air, did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile her to its remote ſituation, in this ancient building. The furniture, alſo, was of ancient date; the bed was of blue damaſk, trimmed with tarniſhed gold lace, and its lofty teſter roſe in the form of a canopy, whence the curtains deſcended, like thoſe of ſuch tents as are ſometimes repreſented in old pictures, and, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, much reſembling thoſe, exhibited on the faded tapeſtry, with which the chamber was hung. To Blanche, every object here was matter of curioſity; and, taking the light from her woman to examine the tapeſtry, ſhe perceived, that it repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſcenes from the wars of Troy, though the almoſt colourleſs worſted now mocked the glowing actions they once had painted. She laughed at the ludicrous abſurdity ſhe obſerved, till recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting, that the hands, which had wove it, were, like the poet, whoſe thoughts of fire they had attempted to expreſs, long ſince mouldered into duſt, a train of melancholy ideas paſſed over her mind, and ſhe almoſt wept.</p>

                     <p>BLANCHE's ſlumbers continued, till long after the hour, which ſhe had ſo impatiently anticipated, for her woman, fatigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with travelling, did not call her, till breakfaſt was nearly ready. Her diſappointment, however was inſtantly forgotten, when, on opening the caſement, ſhe ſaw on one hand, the wide ſea ſparkling in the morning rays, with its ſtealing ſails and glancing oars; and on the other, the freſh woods, the plains far ſtretching and the blue mountains, all glowing with the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of day.</p>
                     <p>As ſhe inſpired the pure breeze, health ſpread a deeper bluſh upon her countenance, and pleaſure danced in her eyes.</p>
                     <p>"Who could firſt invent convents!" ſaid ſhe, "and who could firſt perſuade people to go into them? and to make religion a pretence, too, where all that ſhould inſpire it, is ſo carefully ſhut out! God is beſt pleaſed with the homage of a grateful heart, and, when we view his glories, we feel moſt grateful. I never felt ſo much devotion, during the many dull years I was in the convent, as I have done in the few hours that I have been here, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>re I need only look on all around me, to adore God in my inmoſt heart."</p>
                     <p>Saying this, ſhe left the window, bounded along the gallery, and, in the next moment, was in the breakfaſt room, where the Count was already ſeated. The cheerfulneſs of a bright ſunſhine had diſperſed the melancholy glooms of his reflections, a pleaſant ſmile was on his countenance, and he ſpoke in an enlivening voice to Blanche, whoſe heart echoed back the tones. Henri and, ſoon after, the Counteſs with Mademoiſelle Bearn appeared, and the whole party ſeemed to acknowledge the influence of the ſcene; even the Counteſs was ſo much reanimated as to receive the civilities of her huſband with complacency, and but once for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got her good humour, which was when ſhe aſked whether they had any neighbours, who were likely to make <hi>this barbarous ſpot</hi> more tolerable, and whether the Count believed it poſſible for her to exiſt here, without ſome amuſement?"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="38" facs="unknown:029378_0246_0FE085979F861950"/>
Soon after breakfaſt the party diſperſed; the Count, ordering his ſteward to attend him in the library, went to ſurvey the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his premiſes, and to viſit ſome of his tenants; Henri haſtened with alacrity to the ſhore to examine a boat, that was to bear them on a little voyage in the evening and to ſuperintend the adjuſtment of a ſilk awning; while the Counteſs, attended by Mademoiſelle Bearn, retired to an apartment on the modern ſide of the chateau, which was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>itted up with airy elegance; and, as the windows opened upon balconies, that fronted the ſea, ſhe was there ſaved from a view of the <hi>horrid</hi> Pyrenees. Here, while ſhe reclined on a ſofa, and, caſting her languid eyes over the ocean, which appeared beyond the wood tops, indulged in the luxuries of <hi>ennui,</hi> her companion read aloud a ſentimental novel, on ſome faſhionable ſyſtem of philoſophy, for the Counteſs was herſelf ſomewhat of a <hi>philoſopher,</hi> eſpecially as to <hi>infidelity,</hi> and among a certain circle her opinions were waited for with impatience, and received as doctrines.</p>
                     <p>The Lady Blanche, meanwhile, haſtened to indulge, amidſt the wild wood walks around the chateau, her new enthuſiaſm, where, as ſhe wandered under the ſhades, her gay ſpirits gradual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yielded to penſive complacency. Now, ſhe moved with ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emn ſteps, beneath the gloom of thickly interwoven branches, where the freſh dew ſtill hung upon every flower, that peeped from among the graſs; and now tripped ſportively along the path, on which the ſunbeams darted and the checquered foliage trembled—where the tender greens of the beech, the acacia and the mountain aſh, mingling with the ſolemn tints of the cedar, the pine and cypreſs, exhibited as fine a contraſt of colouring, as the majeſtic oak and oriental plane did of form, to the feathery lightneſs of the cork tree and the waving grace of the poplar.</p>
                     <p>Having reached a ruſtic ſeat, within a deep receſs of the woods ſhe reſted awhile, and, as her eyes caught, through a diſtant open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a glimpſe of the blue waters of the Mediterranean, with the white ſail, gliding on its boſom, or of the broad mountain, glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beneath the mid-day ſun, her mind experienced ſomewhat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>When Lady Blanche returned to the chateau, inſtead of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the apartment of the Counteſs, ſhe amuſed herſelf with wandering over that part of the edifice, which ſhe had not yet examined, of which the moſt ancient firſt attracted her curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for though what ſhe had ſeen of the modern, was gay and elegant, there was ſomething in the former more intereſting to her imagination. Having paſſed up the great ſtaircaſe, and through the oak gallery, ſhe entered upon a long ſuite of cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, whoſe walls were either hung with tapeſtry, or wainſcoted with cedar, the furniture of which lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ked almoſt as ancient as the rooms themſelves; the ſpacious fire places, where no mark of ſocial cheer remained, preſented an image of cold deſolation; and the whole ſuite had ſo much the air of neglect and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it ſeemed, as if the venerable perſons, whoſe portraits hung upon the walls, had been the laſt to inhabit them,</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="41" facs="unknown:029378_0247_0FE085A35D784FC0"/>
On leaving theſe rooms, ſhe found herſelf in another gallery, one end of which was terminated by a back ſtaircaſe, and the other by a door, that ſeemed to communicate with the north ſide of the chateau, but which being faſtened, ſhe deſcended the ſtair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe, and opening a door in the wall, a few ſteps down, found her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a ſmall ſquare room, that formed part of the weſt turret of the caſtle. Three windows preſented each a ſeparate and beautiful proſpect; that to the north overlooking Languedoc; another to the weſt, the hills aſcending towards the Pyrenees, whoſe awful ſummits crowned the landſcape; and a third, fronting the ſouth, gave the Mediterranean, and a part of the wild ſhores of Rouſillon, to the eye.</p>
                     <p>Having left the turret, and deſcended the narrow ſtaircaſe, ſhe found herſelf in a duſky paſſage, where ſhe wandered, unable to find her way, till impatience yielded to apprehenſion, and ſhe called for aſſiſtance. Preſently ſteps approached, and light glimmered through a door at the other extremity of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, which was opened with caution by ſome perſon, who did not venture beyond it, and whom Blanche obſerved in ſilence, till the door was cloſing, when ſhe called aloud, and haſtening towards it, perceived the old houſekeeper.</p>
                     <p>"Dear ma'amſelle! is it you?" ſaid Dorothee, "How could you find your way hither?" Had Blanche been leſs occupied by her own fears, ſhe would probably have obſerved the ſtrong ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of terror and ſurpriſe on Dorothee's countenance, who now led her through a long ſucceſſion of paſſages and rooms, that looked as if they had been uninhabited for a century, till they reached that appropriated to the houſekeeper, where Dorothee entreated ſhe would ſit down and take refreſhment. Blanche ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the ſweet meats, offered to her, mentioned her diſcovery of the pleaſant turret, and her wiſh to appropriate it to her own uſe. Whether Dorothee's taſte was not ſo ſenſible to the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of landſcape as her young lady's, or that the conſtant view of lovely ſcenery had deadened it, ſhe forbore to praiſe the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Blanche's enthuſiaſm, which, however, her ſilence did not repreſs. To Lady Blanche's inquiry, of whither the door ſhe had found faſtened at the end of the gallery led, ſhe replied, that it opened to a ſuite of rooms, which had not been entered, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many years, "For," added ſhe, "my late lady died in one of them, and I could never find in my heart to go into them ſince."</p>
                     <p>Blanche, though ſhe wiſhed to ſee theſe chambers, forbore, on obſerving that Dorothee's eyes were filled with tears, to aſk her to unlock them, and, ſoon after, went to dreſs for dinner, at
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:029378_0248_0FE085A906747358"/>
which the whole party met in good ſpirits and good humour, except the Counteſs, whoſe vacant mind, overcome by the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guor of idleneſs, would neither ſuffer her to be happy herſelf, or to contribute to the happineſs of others. Mademoiſelle Bearn, attempting to be witty, directed her <hi>badinage</hi> againſt Henri, who anſwered, becauſe he could not well avoid it, rather than from any inclination to notice her, whoſe livelineſs ſometimes amuſed, but whoſe conceit and inſenſibility often diſguſted him.</p>
                     <p>The cheerfulneſs, with which Blanche rejoined the party, van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed, on her reaching the margin of the ſea; ſhe gazed with apprehenſion upon the immenſe expanſe of waters, which, at a diſtance, ſhe had beheld only with delight and aſtoniſhment, and it was by a ſtrong effort, that ſhe ſo far overcame her fears, as to follow her father into the boat.</p>
                     <p>As ſhe ſilently ſurveyed the vaſt horizon, bending round the diſtant verge of the ocean, an emotion of ſublimeſt rapture ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled to overcome a ſenſe of perſonal danger. A light breeze played on the water, and on the ſilk awning of the boat, and waved the foliage of the receding woods, that crowned the cliffs, for many miles, and which the Count ſurveyed with the pride of conſcious property, as well as with the eye of taſte.</p>
                     <p>At ſome diſtance, among theſe woods, ſtood a pavilion, which had once been the ſcene of ſocial gaiety, and which its ſituation ſtill made one of romantic beauty. Thither, the Count had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered coffee and other refreſhment to be carried, and thither the ſailors now ſteered their courſe, following the windings of the ſhore round many a woody promontory and circling bay; while the penſive tones of horns and other wind inſtruments, played by the attendants in a diſtant boat, echoed among the rocks, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed along the waves. Blanche had now ſubdued her fears; a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful tranquillity ſtole over her mind, and held her in ſilence; and ſhe was too happy even to remember the convent, or her former ſorrows, as ſubjects of compariſon with her preſent felicity.</p>
                     <p>The Counteſs felt leſs unhappy than ſhe had done, ſince the moment of her leaving Paris; for her mind was now under ſome degree of reſtraint; ſhe feared to indulge its wayward humours, and even wiſhed to recover the Count's good opinion. On his family, and on the ſurrounding ſcene, he looked with tempered pleaſure and benevolent ſatisfaction, while his ſon exhibited the gay ſpirits of youth, anticipating new delights, and regretleſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> little path, overgrown with vegetation. At a little diſtance from
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:029378_0248_0FE085A906747358"/>
the point of the eminence, within the ſhadowy receſs of the woods, appeared the pavilion, which Blanche perceived, as ſhe caught a glimſe of its portico between the trees, to be built of variegated marble. As ſhe followed the Counteſs, ſhe often turned her eyes with rapture towards the ocean, ſeen beneath the dark foliage, far below, and from thence upon the deep woods, whoſe ſilence and impenetrable gloom awakened emotions more ſolemn but ſcarcely leſs delightful.</p>
                     <p>The pavilion had been prepared, as far as was poſſible, on a very ſhort notice, for the reception of its viſitors but the faded colours of its painted walls and ceiling, and the decayed drape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of its once magnificent furniture, declared how long it had been neglected, and abandoned to the empire of the changing ſeaſons. While the party partook of a collation of fruit and cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee, the horns placed in a diſtant part of the woods, where an echo ſweetened and prolonged their melancholy tones, broke ſoftly on the ſtillneſs of the ſcene. This ſpot ſeemed to attract even the admiration of the Counteſs, or, perhaps, it was merely the pleaſure of planning furniture and decorations, that made her dwell ſo long on the neceſſity of repairing and adorning it; while the Count, never happier than when he ſaw her mind en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged by natural and ſimple objects, acquieſced in all her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns concerning the pavilion.</p>
                     <p>The paintings on the walls and coved ceiling were to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed; the canopies and ſofas were to be of light green da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſk; marble ſtatues of wood nymphs, bearing on their heads baſkets of living flowers, were to adorn the receſſes between the windows, which, deſcending to the ground, were to admit to every part of the room, and it was of octagonal form, the various landſcape. One window opened upon a romantic glade, where the eye roved among woody receſſes, and the ſcene was bounded only by a lengthened pomp of groves; from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, the woods receding diſcloſed the diſtant ſummits of the Pyrenees; a third fronted an avenue, beyond which the grey towers of Chateu-le-Blanc, and a pictureſque part of its ruin were ſeen partially among the foliage; while a fourth gave between the trees, a glimpſe of the green paſtures and villages, that diverſify the banks of the Aude. The Mediterranean, with the bold cliffs, that overlooked its ſhores, were the grand ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of a fifth window, and the others gave in different points of view, the wild ſcenery of the woods.</p>
                     <p>After wandering, for ſometime, in theſe the party returned to the ſhore and embarked; and, the beauty of the evening
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:029378_0249_0FE085B6F9A0A7B0"/>
tempting them to extend their excurſion, they proceeded further up the bay. A dead calm had ſucceeded the light breeze, that wafted them hither, and the men took to their oars. Around, the waters were ſpread into one vaſt expanſe of poliſhed mirror, reflecting the grey cliffs and feathery woods, that overhung its ſurface, the glow of the weſtern horizon and the dark clouds, that came ſlowly from the eaſt. Blanche loved to ſee the dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping oars imprint the water, and to watch the ſpreading circles they left, which gave a tremulous motion to the reflected land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape, without deſtroying the harmony of its features.</p>
                     <p>Above the darkneſs of the woods, her eye now caught a cluſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of high towers, touched with the ſplendour of the ſetting rays; and, ſoon after, the horns being then ſilent, ſhe heard the faint ſwell of choral voices from a diſtance.</p>
                     <p>"What voices are thoſe, upon the air?" ſaid the Count, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round, and liſtening; but the ſtrain had ceaſed. "It ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a veſper hymn, which I have often heard in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent," ſaid Blanche.</p>
                     <p>"We are near the monaſtery, then," obſerved the Count; and, the boat ſoon after doubling a lofty head land, the monaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of St. Claire, appeared, ſeated near the margin of the ſea, where the cliffs ſuddenly ſinking, formed a low ſhore within a ſmall bay, almoſt encircled with woods, among which partial fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the edifice were ſeen; the great gate and gothic win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the hall, the cloiſters and the ſide of a chapel more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote; while a venerable arch, which had once led to a part of the fabric, now demoliſhed, ſtood a majeſtic ruin detached from the main building, beyond which appeared a grand perſpective of the woods. On the grey walls, the moſs had faſtened, and, round the pointed windows of the chapel, the ivy and the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony hung in many a fantaſtic wreath.</p>
                     <p>All without was ſilent and forſaken; but while Blanche gaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with admiration on this venerable pile, whoſe effect was heightened by the ſtrong lights and ſhadows thrown athwart it by a cloudy ſunſet, a ſound of many voices, ſlowly chanting, aroſe from within. The Count bade his men reſt on their oars. The monks were ſinging the hymn of veſpers, and ſome female voices mingled with the ſtrain, which roſe by ſoft degrees, till <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The ſtrain, ſoon after, dropped into ſudden ſilence, and was renewed in a low and ſtill more ſolemn key, till, at length, the holy chorus died away, and was heard no more.—Blanche ſighed, tears trembled in her eyes, and her thoughts

ſeemed wafted with the ſounds to heaven. While a rapt ſtillneſs prevailed in the boat, a train of friars, and then of nuns, veiled in white, iſſued from the cloiſters, and paſſed under the ſhade of the woods, to the main body of the edifice.</p>
                     <p>The Counteſs was the firſt of her party to awaken from this pauſe of ſilence.</p>
                     <p>"Theſe diſmal hymns and friars make one quite melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly," ſaid ſhe; "twilight is coming on; pray let us return, or it will be dark before we get home."</p>
                     <p>The Count, looking up, now perceived, that the twilight of evening was anticipated by an approaching ſtorm. In the eaſt a tempeſt was collecting; a heavy gloom came on, oppoſing and contraſting the glowing ſplendour of the ſetting ſun. The cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourous ſea fowl ſkimmed in fleet circles upon the ſurface of the ſea, dipping their light pinions in the wave, as they fled away in ſearch of ſhelter. The boatmen pulled hard at their oars; but the thunder, that now muttered at a diſtance, and the heavy drops that began to dimple the water, made the Count deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to put back to the monaſtery for ſhelter and the courſe of the boat was immediately changed. As the clouds approached the weſt, their lurid darkneſs changed to a deep ruddy glow, which, by reflection, ſeemed to fire<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The appearance of the heavens alarmed the Counteſs and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle Bearn, whoſe expreſſions of apprehenſion diſtreſſed the Count, and perplexed his men; while Blanche continued ſilent, now agitated with fear, and now with admiration, as ſhe view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the grandeur of the clouds, and their effect on the ſcenery, and liſtened to the long, long peals of thunder, that rolled through the air.</p>
                     <p>The boat having reached the lawn before the monaſtery, the Count ſent a ſervant to announce his arrival, and to entreat ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Superior, who, ſoon after, appeared at the great gate, attended by ſeveral monks, while the ſervant returned with a meſſage, expreſſive at once of hoſpitality and pride, but of pride diſguiſed in ſubmiſſion. The party immediately diſembarked, and, having haſtily croſſed the lawn—for the ſhower was now heavy—were received at the gate by the Superior, who, as they entered, ſtretched forth his hands and gave his bleſſing; and they paſſed into the great hall, were the lady abbeſs waited, attended by ſeveral nuns, clothed, like herſelf, in black, and veiled in white.

                     <p>The Counteſs, fatigued and diſcontented, received the polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Abbeſs with careleſs haughtineſs, and had followed her with indolent ſteps to the parlour, over which the painted caſements and wainſcot of larch-wood threw, at all times, a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy ſhade, and where the gloom of evening now loured al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to darkneſs.</p>
                     <p>While the lady Abbeſs ordered refreſhment, and converſed with the Counteſs, Blanche withdrew to a window, the lower panes of which, being without painting allowed her to obſerve the progreſs of the ſtorm over the Mediterranean, whoſe dark waves that had ſo lately ſlept, now came boldly ſwelling, in long ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, to the ſhore, where they burſt in white foam, and threw up a high ſpray over the rocks. A red ſulphurous tint over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread the long line of clouds, that hung above the weſtern ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon, beneath whoſe dark ſkirts the ſun looking out, illumin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the diſtant ſhores of Languedoc, as well as the tufted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The reſt of the ſcene was in deep gloom, except where a ſunbeam, darting between the clouds, glanced on the white wings of the ſea-fowl, that circled high among them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>She ſighed fervently as ſhe gazed, and then followed the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Abbeſs and the Counteſs to the chapel. Meanwhile, ſome of the Count's ſervants, having gone by land to the chateau for carriages, returned ſoon after veſpers had concluded, when, the ſtorm being ſomewhat abated, the Count and his family return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed home. Blanche was ſurpriſed to diſcover how much the windings of the ſhore had deceived her, concerning the diſtance of the chateau from the monaſtery, whoſe veſper bell ſhe had heard, on the preceding evening, from the windows of the weſt ſaloon, and whoſe towers ſhe would alſo have ſeen from thence, had not twilight veiled them.</p>
                     <p>On their arrival at the chateau, the Counteſs affecting more fatigue than ſhe really felt, withdrew to her apartment, and the Count, with his daughter and Henri, went to the ſupper room, where they had not been long, when they heard, in a pauſe of the guſt, a firing of guns, which the Count underſtanding to be ſignals of diſtreſs from ſome veſſel in the ſtorm, went to a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow that opened towards the Mediterranean, to obſerve further; but the ſea was now involved in utter darkneſs, and the loud howlings of the tempeſt had again overcome every other ſound. Blanche, remembering the bark, which ſhe had before ſeen, now joined her father, with trembling anxiety. In a few moments, the report of guns was again borne along the wind, and as ſuddenly wafted away; a tremendous burſt of thunder followed, and, in the flaſh, that had preceded it, and which ſeemed to quiver over the whole ſurface of the waters, a veſſel was diſcovered, toſſing amidſt the white foam of the waves at ſome diſtance from the ſhore. Impenetrable darkneſs again involved the ſcene, but ſoon a ſecond flaſh ſhewed the bark with one ſail unfurled, driving towards the coaſt. Blanche hung upon her father's arm, with looks full of the agony of united terror and pity, which were unneceſſary to awaken the heart of the Count, who gazed upon the ſea with a piteous expreſſion, and, perceiving that no boat could live in the ſtorm, forbore to ſend one; but he gave orders to his people to carry torches out upon the cliffs, hoping they might prove a kind of beacon to the veſſel, or, at leaſt, warn the crew of the rocks they were approaching. While Henri went out to direct on what part of the cliffs the lights ſhould appear, Blanche remained, with her father at the window, catching every now and then, as the lightnings flaſhed, a glimpſe of the veſſel; and ſhe ſoon ſaw, with reviving hope, the torches flaming on the

                     <p>The Count's ſervants were now ſeen, running to and fro, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Sudden ſhouts from the people on the rocks increaſed the anxiety of Blanche to an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt intolerable degree: but her ſuſpenſe, concerning the fat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

The Count immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gave orders for his own boats to aſſiſt in bringing them to ſhore, and that ſuch of theſe unfortunate ſtrangers as could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Among the latter, were Emily St. Aubert, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Du Pont, Ludovico and Annette, who, having embarked at Leghorn and reached Marſeilles, were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>In Monſieur Du Pont the Count diſcovered an old acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and much joy and congratulation paſſed between them, after which Emily was introduced by name to the Count's fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily, whoſe hoſpitable benevolence diſſipated the little embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which her ſituation had occaſioned her, and the part<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The unaffected kindneſs of Blanche and the lively joy ſhe expreſſed on the eſcape of the ſtrangers, for whom her pity had been ſo much intereſted, grad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually revived Emily's languid ſpirits; and Du Pont, relieved from his terrors for her and for himſelf, felt the full contraſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his late ſituation on a dark and tremendous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

                     <p>Annette, meanwhile, in the ſervants' hall, was telling of all the dangers ſhe had encountered, and congratulating herſelf ſo heartily upon her own and Ludovico's eſcape, and on her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent comforts, that ſhe often made all that part of the chateau ring with merriment and laughter. Ludovico's ſpirits were as gay as her own, but he had diſcretion enough to reſtrain them, and tried to check hers, though in vain, till her laughter, at length, aſcended to <hi>my lady's</hi> chamber, who ſent to inquire what occaſioned ſo much uproar in the chateau, and to command ſilence.</p>
                     <p>Emily withdrew early to ſeek the repoſe ſhe ſo much requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but her pillow was long a ſleepleſs one. On this her return to her native country, many intereſting remembrances were awakened; all the events and ſufferings ſhe had experienced, ſince ſhe quitted it, came in long ſucceſſion to her fancy, and were chaſed only by the image of Valancourt, with whom to believe herſelf once more in the ſame land, after they had been ſo long, and ſo diſtantly ſeparated, gave her emotions of inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribable joy, but which afterward<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He had obſerved Emily, with attention, on the preceding, evening and was as much pleaſed with her, as it was poſſible he could be with any perſon, on ſo ſhort an acquaintance. The mention, made of her by Monſ. Du Pont, had alſo given him a favourable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Emily; but, extremely cautious as to thoſe, whom he introduced to the intimacy of his daughter, he determined, on hearing that the former was no ſtranger at the convent of St. Claire, to viſit the Abbeſs, and, if her account correſponded with his wiſh, to invite Emily to paſs ſometime at the chateau. On this ſubject, he was influenced by a conſideration of the Lady Blanche's welfare, ſtill more than by either a wiſh to oblige her, or to befriend the orphan Emily, for whom, however, he felt conſiderably intereſted.</p>
                     <p>On the following morning, Emily was too much fatigued to appear; but Monſ. Du Pont was at the breakfaſt table, when the Count entered the room, who preſſed him as his former ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and the ſon of a very old friend, to prolong his ſtay at the chateau; an invitation, which Du Pont willingly accepted, ſince it would allow him to be near Emily: and, though he was not conſcious of encouraging a hope that ſhe would ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn his affection, he had not fortitude enough to attempt, at preſent, to overcome it.</p>

Emily, ſmiling at the warmth, with which the Lady Blanche ſpoke, obſerved, that ſhe did not mean to confine herſelf to a convent for life.</p>
                     <p>"No, you may not intend it now," ſaid Blanche; but you do not know to what the nuns may perſuade you to conſent: I know how kind they will appear, and how happy, for I have ſeen too much of their art."</p>

She was alſo intereſted by Dorothee the houſe keeper, who attended them, whoſe appearance was almoſt as antique as the objects around her, and who ſeemed no leſs intereſted by Emily, on whom ſhe frequently gazed with ſo much deep attention, as ſcarcely to hear what was ſaid to her.</p>
                     <p>While Emily looked from one of the caſements, ſhe perceived, with ſurpriſe, ſome objects, that were familiar to her memory;—the fields and woods, with the gleaming brook, which ſhe had paſſed with La Voiſin, one evening, ſoon after the death of Monſieur St. Aubert, in her way from the monaſtery to her cottage; and ſhe now knew this to be the chateau, which he had then avoided, and concerning which he had dropped ſome remarkable hints.</p>
                     <p>Shocked by this diſcovery, yet ſcarcely knowing why, ſhe muſed for ſometime in ſilence, and remembered the emotion, which her father had betrayed on finding himſelf ſo near this manſion, and ſome other circumſtances of his conduct, that now greatly intereſted her. The muſic, too, which ſhe had formerly heard, and, reſpecting which La Voiſin had given ſuch an odd account, occurred to her, and, deſirous of knowing more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, ſhe aſked Dorothee whether it returned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <pb n="52" facs="unknown:029378_0253_0FE085DC9B71E4E8"/>
"Yes, ma'amſelle," replied Dorothee, "That muſic is ſtill heard, but the muſician has never been found out, nor ever will, I believe; though there are ſome people who can gueſs."</p>
                     <p>"Indeed!" ſaid Emily, "then why do they not purſue the inquiry?"</p>
                     <p>"Ah, young lady! inquiry enough has been made—but who can purſue a ſpirit?"</p>
                     <p>Emily ſmiled, and, remembering how lately ſhe had ſuffered herſelf to be led away by ſuperſtition, determined now to reſiſt its contagion; yet, in ſpight of her efforts, ſhe felt awe mingle with her curioſity, on this ſubject; and Blanche, who had hitherto liſtened in ſilence, now inquired what this muſic was, and how long it had been heard.</p>
                     <p>"Ever ſince the death of my lady, madam," replied Dorothee,</p>
                     <p>"Why the place is not haunted, ſurely?" ſaid Blanche, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween jeſting and ſeriouſneſs.</p>
                     <p>"I have heard that muſic almoſt ever ſince my dear lady died," continued Dorothee, "and never before then. But that is nothing to ſome things I could tell of."</p>
                     <p>"Do, pray, tell them, then," ſaid Lady Blanche, now more in earneſt than in jeſt. "I am much intereſted, for I have heard ſiſter Henriette, and ſiſter Sophie, in the convent, tell of ſuch ſtrange appearances, which they themſelves had witneſſed!"</p>
                     <p>"You never heard, my lady, I ſuppoſe, what made us leave the chateau, and go and live in a cottage," ſaid Dorothee. "Never!" replied Blanche with impatience.</p>
                     <p>"Nor the reaſon, that my lord, the Marquis"—Dorothee checked herſelf, heſitated, and then endeavoured to change the topic; but the curioſity of Blanche was too much awakened to ſuffer the ſubject thus eaſily to eſcape her, and ſhe preſſed th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The Lady Blanche, meanwhile, unable to prevail with Doro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thee to explain the ſubject of her late hints, had deſired, on reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the door, that terminated the gallery, and which ſhe found faſtened on the preceding day, to ſee the ſuite of rooms beyond. "Dear young lady," ſaid the houſekeeper, "I have told you my reaſon for not opening them; I have never ſeen them, ſince my dear lady died; and it would go hard with me to ſee them now. Pray, madam, do not aſk me again."</p>
                     <p>"Certainly I will not," replied Blanche, "if that is really your objection."</p>
                     <p>"Alas! it is," ſaid the old woman, "we all loved her well, and I ſhall always grieve for her. Time runs round! it is now many years ſince ſhe died; but I remember every thing, that happened then, as if it was but yeſterday. Many things, that have paſſed of late years, are gone quite from my memory, while, thoſe ſo long ago, I can ſee as if in a glaſs." She pauſed, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, as they walked up the gallery, added of Emily, "This young lady ſometimes brings the late Marchioneſs to my mind; I can remember, when ſhe looked juſt as blooming, and very like her, when ſhe ſmiles. Poor lady! how gay ſhe was, when ſhe firſt came to the chateau!"</p>
                     <p>"And was ſhe not gay afterwards?" ſaid Blanche.</p>
                     <p>Dorothee ſhook her head; and Emily obſerved her, with eyes ſtrongly expreſſive of the intereſt ſhe now felt. "Let us ſit down in this window," ſaid the Lady Blanche, on reaching the oppoſite end of the gallery: "and pray, Dorothee, if it is not painful to you, tell us ſomething more about the Marchioneſs. I ſhould like to look into the glaſs you ſpoke of juſt now, and ſee a few of the circumſtances, which you ſay often paſs over it."</p>
                     <p>"No, my lady," replied Dorothee; "if you knew as much as I do, you would not, for you would find there a diſmal train of them; I often wiſh I could ſhut them out, but they will riſe to my mind. I ſee my dear lady on her death bed,—her very look,—and remember all ſhe ſaid—it was a terrible ſcene!"</p>
                     <p>"Why was it ſo terrible?" ſaid Emily with emotion.</p>
                     <p>"Ah, dear young lady! is not death always terrible?" repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Dorothee.</p>
                     <p>To ſome further inquiries of Blanche Dorothee was ſilent; and Emily, obſerving the tears in her eye, forbore to urge the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and endeavoured to withdraw the attention of her young friend to ſome object in the gardens, where the Count, with the

Counteſs and Monſieur Du Pont, appearing, they went down to join them.</p>
                     <p>When he perceived Emily, he advanced to meet her, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented her to the Counteſs, in a manner ſo benign, that it recall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moſt powerfully to her mind the idea of her late father, and ſhe felt more gratitude to him, than embarraſſment towards <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Whatever this might be, or whatever had paſſed in his converſation with the lady Abbeſs, whom he had juſt viſited, eſteem and kindneſs were ſtrongly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent in his manner, when he addreſſed Emily, who experienced that ſweet emotion, which ariſes from the conſciouſneſs of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing the approbation of the good; for to the Count's worth ſhe had been inclined to yield her confidence almoſt from the firſt moment, in which ſhe had ſeen him.</p>
                     <p>Before ſhe could finiſh her acknowledgments for the hoſpitali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhe had received, and mention her deſign of going immediately to the convent, ſhe was interrupted by an invitation to lengthen her ſtay at the chateau, which was preſſed by the Count and Counteſs, with an appearance of ſuch friendly ſincerity, that, though ſhe much wiſhed to ſee her old friends at the monaſtery, and to ſigh, once more, over her father's grave, ſhe conſented to remain a few days at the chateau.</p>
                     <p>To the Abbeſs, however, ſhe immediately wrote, mentioning her arrival in Languedoc and her wiſh to be received into the convent as a boarder; ſhe alſo ſent letters to Monſieur Queſnel and to Valancourt, whom ſhe merely informed of her arrival i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>In the evening, Lady Blanche and Monſ. Du Pont walked with Emily to the cottage of La Voiſin, which ſhe had now a melancholy pleaſure in approaching, for time had ſoftened her grief for the loſs of St. Aubert, though it could not annihilate it, and ſhe felt a ſoothing ſadneſs in indulging the recollections, which this ſcene recalled. La Voiſin was ſtill living, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to enjoy, as much as formerly, the tranquil evening of a blameleſs life. He was ſitting at the door of his cottage, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome of his grand children, playing on the graſs before him, and now and then, with a laugh, or a commendation, encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſports. He immediately recollected Emily whom he was much pleaſed to ſee, and ſhe was as rejoiced to hear, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> he had not loſt one of his family, ſince her departure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="55" facs="unknown:029378_0254_0FE085E236A36D40"/>
"Yes, ma'amſelle" ſaid the old man, "we all live merrily to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſtill, thank God! and I believe there is not a happier family to be found in Languedoc, than ours."</p>
                     <p>Emily did not truſt herſelf in the chamber, where St. Aubert died; and after half an hour's converſation with La Voiſin and his family, ſhe left the cottage.</p>
                     <p>During theſe the firſt days of her ſtay at Chateau-le-Blanc, ſhe was often affected, by obſerving the deep, but ſilent melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, which at times ſtole over Du Pont; and Emily, pitying the ſelf deluſion, which diſarmed him of the will to depart, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to withdraw herſelf as ſoon as the reſpect ſhe owed the Count and Counteſs de Villeſort would permit. The dejection of his friend ſoon alarmed the anxiety of the Count, to whom Du Pont, at length, confided the ſecret of his hopeleſs affection, which, however, the former could only commiſerate, though he ſecretly determined to befriend his ſuit, if an opportunity of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo ſhould ever occur. Conſidering the dangerous ſituation of Du Pont, he but feebly oppoſed his intention of leaving Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau-le-Blanc, on the following day, but drew from him a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of a longer viſit, when he could return with ſafety to his peace. Emily herſelf, though ſhe could not encourage his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, eſteemed him both for the many virtues he poſſeſſed, and for the ſervices ſhe had received from him; and it was not without tender emotions of gratitude and pity, that ſhe now ſaw him depart for his family ſeat in Gaſcony; while he took leave of her with a countenance ſo expreſſive of love and grief, as to intereſt the Count more warmly in his cauſe than before.</p>
                     <p>In a few days, Emily alſo left the chateau, but not before the Count and Counteſs had received her promiſe to repeat her viſit very ſoon; and ſhe was welcomed by the Abbeſs, with the ſame maternal kindneſs ſhe had formerly experienced, and by the nuns, with much expreſſion of regard. The well known ſcenes of the convent occaſioned her many melancholy recollections, but with theſe were mingled others, that inſpired gratitude for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſcaped the various dangers, that had purſued her, ſince ſhe quitted it, and for the good, which ſhe yet poſſeſſed; and, though ſhe once more wept, over her father's grave, with tears of tender affection, her grief was ſoftened from its former acuteneſs.</p>
                     <p>Sometime after her return to the monaſtery, ſhe received a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from her uncle, Monſ. Queſnel, in anſwer to information that ſhe had arrived in France, and to her inquiries, concerning ſuch of her affairs as he had undertaken to conduct during her abſence, eſpecially as to the period for which La Vallee had been let,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:029378_0255_0FE085F204881860"/>
whither it was her wiſh to return, if it ſhould appear, that her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come would permit her to do ſo. The reply of Monſ. Queſnel was cold and formal, as ſhe expected, expreſſing neither concern for the evils ſhe ſuffered, nor pleaſure, that ſhe was now removed from them; nor did he allow the opportunity to paſs, of reprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her for her rejection of Count Morano, whom he affected ſtill to believe a man of honour and fortune; nor of vehemently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming againſt Montoni, to whom he had always, till now, felt himſelf to be inferior. On Emily's pecuniary concerns, he was not very explicit; he informed her, however, that the term, for which La Vallee had been engaged, was nearly expired; but, without inviting her to his own houſe, added, that her circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances would by no means a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>To her inquiries, reſpecting poor old Thereſa, her late fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's ſervant, he gave no anſwer. In the poſtſcript to his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Monſieur Queſnel mentioned M. Motteville, in whoſe hands the late St. Aubert had placed the chief of his perſonal proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as being likely to arrange his affairs nearly to the ſatisfaction of his creditors, and that Emily would recover much more of her fortune, than ſhe had formerly reaſon to expect. The letter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo incloſed to Emily an order upon a merchant at Narbonne, for a ſmall ſum of money.</p>
                     <p>The tranquillity of the monaſtery, and the liberty ſhe was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to enjoy, in wandering among the woods and ſhores of this delightful province, gradually reſtored her ſpirits to their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tone, except that anxiety would ſometimes intrude, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Valancourt, as the time approached, when it was poſſible that ſhe might receive a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

could expreſs her admiration and communicate her pleaſures, no eye, that ſparkled to her ſmile, or countenance that reflected her happineſs, and ſhe became ſpiritleſs and penſive. The Count, obſerving her diſſatisfaction, readily yielded to her entreaties, and reminded Emily of her promiſed viſit; but the ſilence of Valancourt, which was now prolonged far beyond the period, when a letter might have arrived from Eſtuviere, oppreſſed Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with ſevere anxiety, and rendering her averſe to ſociety, ſhe would willingly have deferred her acceptance of this invitation, till her ſpirits ſhould be relieved. The Count and his family, however, preſſed to ſee her; and, as the circumſtances, that prompted her wiſh for ſolitude, could not be explained, there was an appearance of caprice in her refuſal, which ſhe could not perſevere in, without offending the friends, whoſe eſteem ſhe val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. At length, therefore, ſhe returned upon a ſecond viſit to Chateau-le-Blanc. Here the friendly manner of Count De Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefort encouraged Emily to mention to him her ſituation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the eſtates of her late aunt, and to conſult him on the means of recovering them. He had little doubt, that the law would decide in her favour, and, adviſing her to apply to it, offered firſt to write to an advocate at Avignon, on whoſe opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion he thought he could rely. His kindneſs was gratefully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by Emily, who, ſoothed by the courteſy ſhe daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced, would have been once more happy, could ſhe have been aſſured of Valancourt's welfare and unaltered affection. She had now been above a week at the chateau, without receiving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of him, and though ſhe knew, that if he was abſent from his brother's reſidence, it was ſcarcely probable her letter had yet reached him, ſhe could not forbear to admit doubts and fears, that deſtroyed her peace. Again ſhe would conſider of all that might have happened in the long period, ſince her firſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion at Udolpho, and her mind was ſometimes ſo overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an apprehenſion, that Valancourt was no more, or that he lived no longer for her, that the company even of Blanche be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came intolerably oppreſſive, and ſhe would ſit alone in her apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for hours together, when the engagements of the family al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed her to do ſo, without incivility.</p>
                     <p>In one of theſe ſolitary hours, ſhe unlocked a little box, which contained ſome letters of Valancourt, with ſome drawings ſhe had ſketched during her ſtay in Tuſcany, the latter which were no longer intereſting to her; but, in the letters, ſhe now with melancholy indulgence, meant to retrace the tenderneſs, that had
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:029378_0256_0FE085F6A6100C90"/>
ſo often ſoothed her, and rendered her, for a moment inſenſible of the diſtance, which ſeparated her from the writer. But their effect was now changed; the affection they expreſſed appealed ſo forcibly to her heart, when ſhe conſidered that it had, perhaps, yielded to the powers of time and abſence, and even the view of the hand writing recalled ſo many painful recollections, that ſhe found herſelf unable to go through the firſt ſhe had opened, and ſat muſing, with her cheek reſting on her arm, and tears ſtealing from her eyes, when old Dorothee entered the room to inform her, that dinner would be ready, an hour before the uſual time. Emily ſtarted on perceiving her, and haſtily put up the papers, but not before Dorothee had obſerved both her agitation and her tears.</p>
                     <p>"Ah, ma'amſelle!" ſaid ſhe, "you, who are ſo young,—have you reaſon for ſorrow?"</p>
                     <p>Emily tried to ſmile, but was unable to ſpeak.</p>
                     <p>"Alas! dear young lady, when you come to my age, you will not weep at trifles; and ſurely you have nothing ſerious to grieve you."</p>
                     <p>"No, Dorothee, nothing of any conſequence," replied Emily, Dorothee, now ſtooping to pick up ſomething, that had dropped from among the papers, ſuddenly exclaimed, "Holy Mary! what is it I ſee?" and then, trembling, ſat down in a chair, that ſtood by the table.</p>
                     <p>"What is it you do ſee?" ſaid Emily, alarmed by her man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and looking round the room.</p>
                     <p>"It is herſelf," ſaid Dorothee, "her very ſelf! juſt as ſhe looked a little before ſhe died!"</p>
                     <p>Emily, ſtill more alarmed, began now to fear, that Dorothee was ſeized with ſudden phrenſy, but entreated her to explain herſelf.</p>
                     <p>"That picture?" ſaid ſhe, "where did you find it, lady? it is my bleſſed miſtreſs herſelf!"</p>
                     <p>She laid on the table the miniature, which Emily had long ago found among the papers her father had enjoined her to deſtroy, and over which ſhe had once ſeen him ſhed ſuch tender and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting tears; and, recollecting all the various circumſtances of his conduct, that had long perplexed her, her emotions increaſed to an exceſs, which deprived her of all power to aſk the queſtions ſhe trembled to have anſwered, and ſhe could only inquire, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Dorothee was certain the picture reſembled the late Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs.</p>
                     <p>"O, ma'amſelle!" ſaid ſhe, "how came it to ſtrike me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> the inſtant I ſaw it, if it was not my lady's likeneſs? Ah
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:029378_0256_0FE085F6A6100C90"/>
added ſhe, taking up the miniature, "theſe are her own blue eyes—looking ſo ſweet and ſo mild; and there is her very look, ſuch as I have often ſeen it, when ſhe had ſat thinking for a long while, and then, the tears would often ſteal down her cheeks—but ſhe never would complain! It was that look ſo meek, as it were, and reſigned, that uſed to break my heart and make me love her ſo!"</p>
                     <p>"Dorothee!" ſaid Emily ſolemnly, "I am intereſted in the cauſe of that grief, more ſo, perhaps, than you may imagine; and I entreat, that you will no longer refuſe to indulge my cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity;—it is not a common one."</p>
                     <p>As Emily ſaid this, ſhe remembered the papers, with which the picture had been found, and had ſcarcely a doubt, that they had concerned the Marchioneſs do Villeroi; but with this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition came a ſcruple, whether ſhe ought to inquire further on a ſubject, which might prove to be the ſame, that her father had ſo carefully endeavoured to conceal. Her curioſity, concerning the Marchioneſs, powerful as it was, it is probable ſhe would now have reſiſted, as ſhe had formerly done, on unwarily obſerving the few terrible words in the papers, which had never ſince been eraſed from her memory, had ſhe been certain that the hiſtory of that lady was the ſubject of thoſe papers, or that ſuch ſimple particulars only as it was probable Dorothee could relate were included in her father's command. What was known to her could be no ſecret to many other perſons; and, ſince it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared very unlikely, that St. Aubert ſhould attempt to conceal what Emily might learn by ordinary means, ſhe at length con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that if the papers had related to the ſtory of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs, it was not thoſe circumſtances of it, which Dorothee could diſcloſe, that he had thought ſufficiently important to wiſh to have concealed. She, therefore, no longer heſitated to make the inquiries, that might lead to the gratification of her curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</p>
                     <p>"Ah, ma'amſelle!" ſaid Dorothee, "it is a ſad ſtory, and cannot be told now: but what am I ſaying? I never will tell it. Many years have paſſed, ſince it happened; and I never loved to talk of the Marchioneſs to any body, but my huſband. He lived in the family, at that time, as well as myſelf, and he knew many particulars from me, which nobody elſe did; for I was about the perſon of my lady in her laſt illneſs, and ſaw and heard as much, or more than my lord himſelf. Sweet ſaint! how patient ſhe was! When ſhe died, I thought I could have died with her!"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="60" facs="unknown:029378_0257_0FE0860481B368D8"/>
"Dorothee," ſaid Emily, interrupting her, "what you ſhall tell, you may depend upon it, ſhall never be diſcloſed by me. I have, I repeat it, particular reaſons for wiſhing to be informed on this ſubject, and am willing to bind myſelf, in the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn manner, never to mention what you ſhall wiſh me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal."</p>
                     <p>Dorothee ſeemed ſurpriſed at the earneſtneſs of Emily's man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and, after regarding her for ſome moments, in ſilence, ſaid, "Young lady! that look of yours pleads for you—it is ſo like my dear miſtreſs's, that I can almoſt fancy I ſee her before me; if you were her daughter, you could not remind me of her more. But dinner will be ready—had you not better go down?"</p>
                     <p>"You will firſt promiſe to grant my requeſt," ſaid Emily, "and ought not you firſt to tell me, ma'amſelle, how this picture fell into your hands, and the reaſons, you ſay you have for curioſity about my lady?"</p>
                     <p>"Why, no, Dorothee," replied Emily, recollecting herſelf, "I have alſo particular reaſons for obſerving ſilence, on theſe ſubjects, at leaſt, till I know further; and, remember, I do not promiſe ever to ſpeak upon them; therefore, do not let me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce you to ſatisfy my curioſity, from an expectation, that I ſhall gratify yours. What I may judge proper to conceal, does not concern myſelf alone, or I ſhould have leſs ſcruple in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing it; let a confidence in my honour alone perſuade you to diſcloſe what I requeſt."</p>
                     <p>"Well, lady!" replied Dorothee, after a long pauſe, during which her eyes were fixed upon Emily, "you ſeem ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted,—and this picture and that face of yours make me think you have ſome reaſon to be ſo,—that I will truſt you—and tell ſome things, that I never told before to any body, but my huſband, though there are people, who have ſuſpected as much. I will tell you the particulars of my lady's death, too, and ſome of my own ſuſpicions; but you muſt firſt promiſe me by all the ſaints"—</p>
                     <p>Emily, interrupting her, ſolemnly promiſed never to reveal what ſhould be confided to her without Dorothee's conſent.</p>
                     <p>"But there is the horn, ma'amſelle ſounding for dinner," ſaid Dorothee; "I muſt be gone."</p>
                     <p>"When ſhall I ſee you again?" inquired Emily.</p>
                     <p>Dorothee muſed, and then replied, "Why, madam, it may make people curious, if it is known I am ſo much in your a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, and that I ſhould be ſorry for; ſo I will come when I am leaſt likely to be obſerved. I have little leiſure in the day,
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:029378_0257_0FE0860481B368D8"/>
and I ſhall have a good deal to ſay; ſo, if you pleaſe, ma'am, I will come, when the family are all in bed."</p>
                     <p>"That will ſuite me very well," replied Emily; "Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber then to night"—</p>
                     <p>"Aye, that is well remembered," ſaid Dorothee, "I fear I cannot come to night, madam, for there will be the dance of the vintage, and it will be late, before the ſervants go to reſt; for, when they once ſet in to dance, they will keep it up, in the cool of the air, till morning; at leaſt, it uſed to be ſo in my time."</p>
                     <p>"Ah! is it the dance of the vintage?" ſaid Emily, with a deep ſigh, remembering, that it was on the evening of this feſtival, in the preceding year, that St. Aubert and herſelf had arrived in the neighbourhood of Chateau-le-Blanc. She pauſed a moment, overcome by the ſudden recollection, and then, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering herſelf, added—"But this dance is in the open woods; you therefore will not be wanted, and can eaſily come to me."</p>
                     <p>Dorothee replied, that ſhe had been accuſtomed to be preſent at the dance of the vintage, and ſhe did not wiſh to be abſent now; "but if I can get away, madam, I will," ſaid ſhe.</p>
                     <p>Emily then haſtened to the dining room, where the Count con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted himſelf with the courteſy, which is inſeparable from true dignity, and of which the Counteſs frequently practiſed lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, though her manner to Emily was an exception to her uſual habit. But, if ſhe retained few of the ornamental virtues, ſhe cheriſhed other qualities, which ſhe ſeemed to conſider invalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. She had diſmiſſed the grace of modeſty, but then ſhe knew perfectly well how to manage the ſtare of aſſurance; her manners had little of the tempered ſweetneſs, which is neceſſary to render the female character intereſting, but ſhe could occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally throw into them an affectation of ſpirits, which ſeemed to triumph over every perſon, who approached her. In the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, however, ſhe generally affected an elegant languor, that perſuaded her almoſt to faint, when her favourite read to her a ſtory of fictitious ſorrow; but her countenance ſuffered no change when living objects of diſtreſs ſolicited her charity, and her heart beat with no tranſport to the thought of giving them inſtant relief;—ſhe was a ſtranger to the higheſt luxury, of which, perhaps, the human mind can be ſenſible, for her ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evolence had never yet called ſmiles upon the face of miſer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>In the evening, the Count, with all his family, except the Counteſs and Mademoiſelle Bearn, went to the woods to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> the feſtivity of the peaſants. The ſcene was in a glade, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> the trees, opening, formed a circle round the turf they highly

overſhadowed; between their branches, vines, loaded with ripe cluſters, were hung in gay feſtoons; and, beneath, were tables, with fruit, wine, cheeſe and other rural fare,—and ſeats for the Count and his family. At a little diſtance, were benches for the elder peaſants, few of whom, however, could forbear to join the jocund dance, which began ſoon after ſunſet, when ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral of ſixty, tripped it with almoſt as much glee and airy light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as thoſe of ſixteen.</p>
                     <p>The muſicians, who ſat careleſsly on the graſs at the foot of a tree, ſeemed inſpired by the ſound of their own inſtruments, which were chiefly flutes and a kind of a long guitar. Behind ſtood a boy, flouriſhing a tamborine, and dancing a ſolo, except that, as he ſometimes gaily toſſed the inſtrument, he tripped among the other dancers, when his antic geſtures called forth a broader laugh, and heightened the ruſtic ſpirit of the ſcene.</p>
                     <p>The Count was highly delighted with the happineſs he wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed, to which his bounty had largely contributed, and the Lady Blanche joined the dance with a young gentleman of her father's party. Du Pont requeſted Emily's hand, but her ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its were too much depreſſed, to permit her to engage in the preſent feſtivity, which called to her remembrance that of the preceding year, when St. Aubert was living, and of the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly ſcenes which had immediately followed it.</p>
                     <p>Overcome by theſe recollections, ſhe, at length left the ſpot, and walked ſlowly into the woods, where the ſoftened muſic, floating at a diſtance, ſoothed her melancholy mind. The moon threw a mellow light among the foliage; the air was balmy and cool, and Emily, loſt in thought, ſtrolled on, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out obſerving whither, till ſhe perceived the ſounds ſinking afar off <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> appeared; for the Count had been ſo much engaged in directing other improvements, that he had neglected to give orders concerning this extenſive approach, and the road was yet broken, and the trees overloaded with their own luxuriance.</p>
                     <p>As ſhe ſtood ſurveying it, and remembering the emotions which ſhe had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="63" facs="unknown:029378_0258_0FE0860916B53798"/>
had returned no anſwer to Michael's repeated calls; and ſhe experienced ſomewhat of the fear, that had then aſſailed her, for it did not appear improbable, that theſe deep woods were occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally the haunt of banditti. She, therefore, turned back, and was haſtily purſuing her way to the dancers, when ſhe heard ſteps approaching from the avenue; and, being ſtill beyond the call of the peaſants on the green, for ſhe could neither hear their voices, or their muſic, ſhe quickened her pace; but the perſons following gained faſt upon her, and, at length diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing the voice of Henri, ſhe walked leiſurely, till he came up. He expreſſed ſome ſurpriſe at meeting her ſo far from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; and, on her ſaying, that the pleaſant moonlight had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled her to walk farther than ſhe intended, an exclamation burſt from the lips of his companion, and ſhe thought ſhe heard Valancourt ſpeak! It was, indeed, he! and the meeting was ſuch as may be imagined, between perſons ſo affectionate, and ſo long ſeparated as they had been.</p>
                     <p>In the joy of theſe moments, Emily forgot all her paſt ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and Valancourt ſeemed to have forgotten, that any perſon but Emily exiſted; while Henri was a ſilent and aſtoniſhed ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator of the ſcene.</p>
                     <p>Valancourt aſked a thouſand queſtions, concerning herſelf and Montoni, which there was now no time to anſwer; but ſhe learned that her letter had been forwarded to him, at Paris, which he had previouſly quitted, and was returning to Gaſcony, whither the letter alſo returned, which, at length informed him of Emily's arrival, and on the receipt of which he had imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſet out for Languedoc. On reaching the monaſtery, whence ſhe had dated her letter, he found, to his extreme diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment, that the gates were already cloſed for the night; and believing, that he ſhould not ſee Emily, till the morrow, he was returning to his little inn, with the intention of writing to her, when he was overtaken by Henri, with whom he had been intimate at Paris, and was led to her, whom he was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly lamenting that he ſhould not ſee, till the following day.</p>
                     <p>Emily, with Valancourt and Henri, now returned to the green, where the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> continued their feſtivity, he ſeated himſelf by Emily, and converſed, without conſtraint. The lights, which
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:029378_0259_0FE086176A7FD260"/>
were hung among the trees, under which they ſat, allowed her a more perfect view of the countenance ſhe had ſo frequently in abſence endeavoured to recollect, and ſhe perceived, with ſome regret, that it was not the ſame as when laſt ſhe ſaw it. There was all its wonted intelligence and ſire; but it had loſt much of the ſimplicity, and ſomewhat of the open benevolence, that uſed to characteriſe it. Still, however, it was an intereſting counten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; but Emily thought ſhe perceived, at intervals, anxiety contract, and melancholy fix the features of Valancourt; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, too, he fell into a momentary muſing, and then appeared anxious to diſſipate thought; while, at others, as he fixed his eyes on Emily, a kind of ſudden diſtraction ſeemed to croſs his mind. In her he perceived the ſame goodneſs and beautiful ſimplicity, that had charmed him, on their firſt acquaintance. The bloom of her countenance was ſomewhat faded, but all its ſweetneſs remained, and it was rendered more intereſting, than ever, by the faint expreſſion of melancholy, that ſometimes mingled with her ſmile.</p>
                     <p>At his requeſt, ſhe related the moſt important circumſtances, that had occured to her, ſince ſhe left France, and emotions of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and indignation alternately prevailed in his mind, when he heard how much ſhe had ſuffered from the villany of Montoni. More than once, when ſhe was ſpeaking of his conduct, of which the guilt was rather ſoftened, than exaggerated, by her repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, he ſtarted from his ſeat and walked away, apparently overcome as much by ſelf accuſation as by reſentment. Her ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings alone were mentioned in the few words, which he could addreſs to her, and he liſtened not to the account, which ſhe was careful to give as diſtinctly as poſſible of the preſent loſs of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame Montoni's eſtates, and of the little reaſon there was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect their reſtoration. At length, Valancourt remained loſt in thought, and then ſome ſecret cauſe ſeemed to overcome him, with anguiſh. Again he abruptly left her. When he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhe perceived, that he had been weeping, and tenderly beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that he would compoſe himſelf. "My ſufferings are all paſſed now," ſaid ſhe, "for I have eſcaped from the tyranny of Montoni, and I ſee you well—let me alſo ſee you happy."</p>
                     <p>Valancourt was more agitated, than before. "I am unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of you, Emily," ſaid he, "I am unworthy of you;"—words, by his manner of uttering which Emily was then more ſhocked than by their import. She <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

"I would aſk," ſaid Emily, in a gentle but agitated voice, "the meaning of your words; but I perceive, that the queſtion would diſtreſs you now. Let us talk on other ſubjects. To morrow, perhaps, you may be more compoſed. Obſerve thoſe moonlight woods, and the towers, which appear obſcurely in the perſpective. You uſed to be a great admirer of landſcape, and I have heard you ſay, that the faculty of deriving conſolation, under misfortune, from the ſublime proſpects, which neither op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, or poverty withhold from us, was the peculiar bleſſing of the innocent." Valancourt was deeply affected. "Yes," replied he, "I had once a taſte for innocent and elegant delights, I had once an uncorrupted heart." Then, checking himſelf, he added, "Do you remember our journey together in the Pyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nees?"</p>
                     <p>"Can I forget it?" ſaid Emily—"Would that I could!" he replied;—"that was the happieſt period of my life. I then loved with enthuſiaſm, whatever was truely great, or good." It was ſometime before Emily could repreſs her tears, and try to command her emotions. "If you wiſh to forget that journey," ſaid ſhe, "it muſt certainly be my wiſh to forget it alſo." She pauſed, and then added, "You make me very uneaſy; but this is not the time for further inquiry; yet, how can I bear to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, even for a moment, that you are leſs worthy of my eſteem than formerly? I have ſtill ſufficient confidence in your can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, to believe, that, when I ſhall aſk for an explanation, you will give it me."—"Yes," ſaid Valancourt, "yes, Emily: I have not, yet loſt my candour: if I had, I could better have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed my emotions, on learning what were your ſufferings—your virtues,—while I—I—but I will ſay no more. I did not mean to have ſaid even ſo much—I have been ſurpriſed into the ſelf-accuſation. Tell me, Emily, that you will not forget that jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney—will not wiſh to forget it, and I will be calm. I would not loſe the remembrance of it for the whole earth."</p>
                     <p>"How contradictory is this!" ſaid Emily;—"but we may be overheard. My recollection of it ſhall depend upon yours; I will endeavour to forget, or to recollect it, as you may do. Let us join the Count."—"Tell me, firſt," ſaid Valancourt, "that you forgive the uneaſineſs I have occaſioned you, this evening, and that you will ſtill love me."—"I ſincerely forgive you," replied Emily. "You beſt know whether I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to love, you, for you know whether you deſerve my eſteem. At preſent, I will believe that you do. It is unneceſſary to ſay," added ſhe, obſerving his dejection, "how much pain it would

give me to believe otherwiſe.—The young lady who approaches is the Count's daughter."</p>
                     <p>Valancourt and Emily now joined the Lady Blanche; and the party, ſoon after, ſat down with the Count, his ſon, and the Chevalier Du Pont, at a banquet, ſpread under a gay awning, beneath the trees. At the table alſo were ſeated ſeveral of the moſt venerable of the Count's tenants, and it was a feſtive repaſt to all but Valancourt and Emily. When the Count retired to the chateau, he did not invite Valancourt to accompany him, who, therefore, took leave of Emily, and retired to his ſolitary inn for the night: meanwhile, ſhe ſoon withdrew to her own apartment, where ſhe muſed, with deep anxiety and concern, on his behaviour, and on the Count's reception of him. Her atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> ſo wholly engaged, that ſhe forgot Dorothee and her appointment, till morning was far advanced, when, knowing that the good old woman would not come, ſhe retired, for a few hours to repoſe.</p>
                     <p>On the following day, when the Count had accidentally joined Emily in one of the walks, they talked of the feſtival of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding evening, and this led him to a mention <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Valancourt. "That is a young man of talents," ſaid he; "you were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly acquainted with him, I perceive." Emily ſaid that ſhe was. "He was introduced to me at Paris," ſaid the Count, "and I was much pleaſed with him, on our firſt acquaintance." He pauſed, and Emily trembled, between the deſire of hearing more and the fear of ſhewing the Count, that ſhe felt an intereſt on the ſubject. "May I aſk," ſaid he, at length, "how long you have known Monſieur Valancourt?"—"Will you allow me to aſk your reaſon for the queſtion, ſir?" ſaid ſhe; "and I will anſwer it immediately."—"Certainly," ſaid the Count, "that is but juſt. I will tell you my reaſon. I cannot but perceive that Monſieur Valancourt admires you; in that, however, there is nothing extraordinary; every perſon, who ſees you muſt do the ſame. I am above uſing common place compliments; I ſpeak with ſincerity. What I fear, is, that he is a favoured admirer."—"Why do you fear it, ſir?" ſaid Emily, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to conceal her emotion.—"Becauſe," replied the Count, "I think him not worthy of your favour." Emily, greatly agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, entreated further explanation. "I will give it," ſaid he, "if you will believe, that nothing but a ſtrong intereſt in your welfare could induce me to hazard that aſſertion."—"I muſt believe ſo, ſir," replied Emily.</p>
                     <p>"But let us reſt under theſe trees," ſaid the Count, obſerving the paleneſs of her countenance; "here is a ſeat—you are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued."
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:029378_0260_0FE0861C0A7C20B8"/>
They ſat down, and the Count proceeded. "Many young ladies, circumſtanced as you are, would think my conduct, on this occaſion, and on ſo ſhort an acquaintance, impertinent, inſtead of friendly; from what I have obſerved of your temper and underſtanding, I do not fear ſuch a return from you. Our acquaintance has been ſhort, but long enough to make me eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem you, and feel a lively intereſt in your happineſs. You de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be very happy, and I truſt that you will be ſo." Emily ſighed ſoftly, and bowed her thanks. The Count pauſed again, "I am unpleaſantly circumſtanced," ſaid he, "but an opportunity of rendering you important ſervice ſhall overcome inferior conſiderations. Will you inform me of the manner of your firſt acquaintance with the Chevalier Valancourt, if the ſubject is not too painful?"</p>
                     <p>Emily briefly related the accident of their meeting in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of her father, and then ſo earneſtly entreated the Count not to heſitate in declaring what he knew, that he perceived the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent emotion, againſt which ſhe was contending, and, regarding her with a look of tender compaſſion, conſidered how he might communicate his information with leaſt pain to his anxious auditor.</p>
                     <p>"The Chevalier and my ſon," ſaid he, "were introduced to each other, at the table of a brother officer, at whoſe houſe I alſo met him, and invited him to my own, whenever he ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged. I did not then know, that he had formed an acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with a ſet of men, a diſgrace to their ſpecies, who live by plunder and paſs their lives in continual debauchery. I knew ſeveral of the Chevalier's family, reſident at Paris, and conſidered them as ſufficient pledges for his introduction to my own. But you are ill; I will leave the ſubject."—"No, ſir," ſaid Emily, "I beg you will proceed; I am only diſtreſſed."—"<hi>Only!"</hi> ſaid the Count, with emphaſis; "however, I will proceed. I ſoon learned, that theſe, his aſſociates, had drawn him into a courſe of diſſipation, from which he appeared to have neither the power, nor the inclination, to extricate himſelf. He loſt large ſums at the gaming table; he became infatuated with play; and was ruined. I ſpoke tenderly of this to his friends, who aſſured me, that they had remonſtrated with him, till they were weary. I afterwards learned, that, in conſideration of his talents for play, which were generally ſucceſsful, when unoppoſed by the tricks of villany,—that, in conſideration of theſe, the party had initiat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him into the ſecrets of their trade, and allotted him a ſhare of their profits." "Impoſſible!" ſaid Emily ſuddenly; "but—pardon me, ſir, I ſcarcely know what I ſay; allow for the
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:029378_0261_0FE086285A35F600"/>
diſtreſs of my mind. I muſt, indeed, I muſt believe, that you have not been truly informed. The Chevalier had, doubtleſs, enemies who miſrepreſented him."—"I ſhould be moſt happy to believe ſo," replied the Count, "but I cannot. Nothing ſhort of conviction, and a regard for your happineſs could have urged me to repeat theſe unpleaſant reports."</p>
                     <p>Emily was ſilent. She recollected Valancourt's ſayings, on the preceding evening, which diſcovered the pangs of ſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and ſeemed to confirm all that the Count had related. Yet ſhe had not fortitude enough to dare conviction. Her heart was overwhelmed with anguiſh at the mere ſuſpicion of his guilt, and ſhe could not endure a belief of it. After a long ſilence, the Count ſaid, "I perceive, and can allow for, your want of conviction. It is neceſſary I ſhould give ſome proof of what I have aſſerted; but this I cannot do, without ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one, who is very dear to me, to danger."—"What is the danger you apprehend, ſir?" ſaid Emily; "if I can prevent it, you may ſafely confide in my honour."—"On your honour I am certain I can rely," ſaid the Count; "but can I truſt your fortitude? Do you think you can reſiſt the ſolicitation of a favoured admirer, when he pleads, in affliction, for the name of one, who has robbed him of a bleſſing?"—"I ſhall not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſuch a temptation, ſir," ſaid Emily, with modeſt pride, "for I cannot favour one, whom I muſt no longer eſteem. I, however, readily give my word." Tears, in the meantime, contradicted her firſt aſſertion; and ſhe felt, that time and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort only could eradicate an affection, which had been formed on virtuous eſteem, and cheriſhed by habit and difficulty.</p>
                     <p>"I will truſt you then," ſaid the Count, "for conviction i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> neceſſary to your peace, and cannot I perceive, be obtained, without this confidence. My ſon has too often been an eye witneſs of the Chevalier's ill conduct; he was very near being drawn in by it; he was, indeed, drawn in to the commiſſion of many follies, but I reſcued him from guilt and deſtruction. Judge then, Mademoiſelle St. Aubert, whether a father who had nearly loſt his only ſon, by the example of the Chevalier, has not, from conviction, reaſon to warn thoſe, whom he eſteems, againſt truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their happineſs in ſuch hands. I have myſelf ſeen the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier engaged in deep play with men, whom I almoſt ſhuddered to look upon. If you ſtill doubt, I will refer you to my ſon."</p>
                     <p>"I muſt not doubt what you have yourſelf witneſſed," repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Emily, ſinking with grief, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> or what you aſſert. But the Chevalier has, perhaps, been drawn only into a tranſient folly,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:029378_0261_0FE086285A35F600"/>
which he may never repeat. If you had known the juſtneſs of his former principles, you would allow for my preſent incredulity."</p>
                     <p>"Alas!" obſerved the Count, "it is difficult to believe that which will make us wretched. But I will not ſooth you by flattering and falſe hopes. We all know how faſcinating the vice of gaming is, and how difficult it is, alſo, to conquer habit; the Chevalier might, perhaps, reform for a while, but he would ſoon relapſe into diſſipation—for I fear, not only the bonds of habit would be powerful, but, that his morals are corrupted. And—why ſhould I conceal from you, that play is not his only vice? he appears to have a taſte for every vicious pleaſure."</p>
                     <p>The Count heſitated and pauſed; while Emily endeavoured to ſupport herſelf, as, with increaſing perturbation, ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected what he might further ſay. A long pauſe of ſilence enſued, during which he was viſibly agitated; at length, he ſaid, "It would be a cruel delicacy, that could prevail with me to be ſilent—and I will inform you, that the Chevalier's extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance has brought him twice into the priſons of Paris, from whence he was laſt extricated, as I was told upon authority, which I cannot doubt, by a well known Pariſian Counteſs, with whom he continued to reſide, when I left Paris."</p>
                     <p>He pauſed again; and, looking at Emily, perceived her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance change, and that ſhe was falling from the ſeat; he caught her, but ſhe had fainted, and he called loudly for aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. They were, however, beyond the hearing of his ſervants at the chateau, and he feared to leave her while he went thither for aſſiſtance, yet knew not how otherwiſe to obtain it; till a fountain at no great diſtance caught his eye, and he endeavoured to ſupport Emily againſt the tree, under which ſhe had been ſitting, while he went thither for water. But, again he was perplexed, for he had nothing near him, in which water could be brought, but while, with increaſed anxiety, he watched her, he thought he perceived in her countenance ſymptoms of returning life.</p>
                     <p>It was long, however, before ſhe revived, and ſhe then found herſelf ſupported—not by the Count but by Valancourt, who was obſerving her with looks of earneſt apprehenſion, and who now ſpoke to her in a tone, tremulous with his anxiety. At the ſound of his well known voice, ſhe raiſed her eyes, but preſently cloſed them, and a faintneſs again came over her.</p>
                     <p>The Count, with a look ſomewhat ſtern, waved him to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw; but he only ſighed heavily, and called on the name of Emily, as he again held the water, that had been brought, to her lips. On the Count's repeating his action, and accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:029378_0262_0FE0862D2ED1CF30"/>
it with words, Valancourt anſwered him with a look of deep reſentment, and refuſed to leave the place, till ſhe ſhould revive, or to reſign her for a moment to the care of any perſon. In the next inſtant, his conſcience ſeemed to inform him of what had been the ſubject of the Count's converſation with Emily, and indignation flaſhed in his eyes; but it was quickly repreſſed, and ſucceeded by an expreſſion of ſerious anguiſh, that induced the Count to regard him with more pity than reſentment, and the view of which ſo much affected Emily, when ſhe again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, that ſhe yielded to the weakneſs of tears. But ſhe ſoon reſtrained them, and, exerting her reſolution to appear recovered, ſhe roſe, thanked the Count and Henri, with whom Valancourt had entered the garden, for their care, and moved towards the chateau, without noticing Valancout, who, heart ſtruck by her manner, exclaimed in a low voice—"Good God! how have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Emily, without replying, but with increaſed emotion, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened her ſteps. "What has thus diſordered you, Emily?" ſaid he, as he ſtill walked by her ſide: "give me a few moments converſation, I entreat you;—I am very miſerable!"</p>
                     <p>Though this was ſpoken in a low voice, it was overheard by the Count, who immediately replied, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Valancourt's cheek was crimſoned; he looked haughtily <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"See me!" exclaimed Valancourt, as he threw a glance of mingled pride and reſentment upon the Count; and then, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to recollect himſelf, he added—"But I will come, madam; I will accept the Count's <hi>permiſſion."</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When they reached the door of the chateau, he lingered <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Emily withdrew to her own apartment, under ſuch oppreſſion of heart as ſhe had ſeldom known, when ſhe endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect all that the Count had told, to examine the probability of the circumſtances he himſelf believed, and to conſider of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

future conduct towards Valancourt. But, when ſhe attempted to think, her mind refuſed controul, and ſhe could only feel that ſhe was miſerable. One moment, ſhe ſunk under the convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that Valancourt was no longer the ſame, whom ſhe had ſo tenderly loved, the idea of whom had hitherto ſupported her under affliction, and cheered her with the hope of happier days,—but a fallen, a worthleſs character, whom ſhe muſt teach herſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to deſpiſe—if ſhe could not forget. Then, unable to endure this terrible ſuppoſition, ſhe rejected it, and diſdained to believe him capable of conduct, ſuch as the Count had deſcribed, to whom ſhe believed he had been miſrepreſented by ſome artful enemy; and there were moments, when ſhe even ventured to doubt the integrity of the Count himſelf, and to ſuſpect, that he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by ſome ſelfiſh motive to break her connection with Valancourt. But this was the error of an inſtant, only; the Count's character which ſhe had heard ſpoken of by Du Pont and many other perſons, and had herſelf obſerved, enabled her to judge, and forbade the ſuppoſition; had her confidence, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, been leſs, there appeared to be no temptation to betray him into conduct ſo treacherous, and ſo cruel. Nor did reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſuffer her to preſerve the hope, that Valancourt had been miſrepreſented to the Count, who had ſaid, that he ſpoke chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from his own obſervation, and from his ſon's experience. She muſt part from Valancourt, therefore, for ever—for what of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther happineſs or tranquillity could ſhe expect with a man, whoſe taſtes were degenerated into low inclinations, and to whom vice was become habitual? whom ſhe muſt no longer eſteem, though the remembrance of what he once was, and the long habit of loving him, would render it very difficult for her to deſpiſe him.</p>
                     <p>"O Valancourt!" ſhe would exclaim, "having been ſeparated ſo long, do we meet, only to be miſerable—only to part for ever."</p>
                     <p>Amidſt all the tumult of her mind, ſhe remembered pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly the ſeeming candour and ſimplicity of his conduct, on the preceding night; and, had ſhe dared to truſt her own heart, it would have led her to hope much from this. Still ſhe could not reſolve to diſmiſs him for ever, without obtaining further proof of his ill conduct; yet ſhe ſaw no probability of procuring it, if, indeed proof more poſitive was poſſible. Something, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it was neceſſary to decide upon, and ſhe almoſt determined to be guided in her opinion ſolely by the manner, with which Valancourt ſhould receive her hints concerning his late conduct.</p>
                     <p>Thus paſſed the hours till dinner time, when Emily, ſtruggling againſt the preſſure of her grief, dried her tears, and joined the family at table, where the Count preſerved towards her the moſt

delicate attention; but the Counteſs and Mademoiſelle Beam, having looked, for a moment, with ſurpriſe, on her dejected coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, began, as uſual, to talk of trifles, while the eyes of Lady Blanche aſked much of her friend, who could only reply by a mournful ſmile.</p>
                     <p>Emily withdrew as ſoon after dinner as poſſible, and was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the Lady Blanche, whoſe anxious inquiries, however, ſhe found herſelf quite unequal to anſwer, and whom ſhe entreated to ſpare her on the ſubject of her diſtreſs. To converſe on any topic, was now, indeed, ſo extremely painful to her, that ſhe ſoon gave up the attempt, and Blanche left her, with pity of the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, which ſhe perceived ſhe had no power to aſſuage.</p>
                     <p>Emily ſecretly determined to go to her convent in a day or two; for company, eſpecially that of the Counteſs and Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle Bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>To have loſt Valancourt by death, or to have ſeen him marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a rival, would, ſhe thought, have given her leſs anguiſh, than a conviction of his unworthineſs, which muſt terminate in miſery to himſelf, and which robbed her even of the ſolitary image her heart ſo long had cheriſhed.

She wiſhed to ſee him, and to terminate her preſent ſtate of ſuſpenſe, yet ſhrunk from the interview, and, incapable of deciding for herſelf, ſhe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

After reading it, he ſaid, that, if ſhe believed her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf well enough to ſupport the interview, his opinion was, that for the relief of both parties, it ought to take place, that evening.</p>
                     <p>"His affection for you is, undoubtedly, a very ſincere one," ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Count; "and he appears ſo much diſtreſſed, and you, my amiable friend, are ſo ill at eaſe—that the ſooner the affair is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided the better."</p>

                     <p>IN the evening, when Emily was at length informed, that Count De Villefort requeſted to ſee her, ſhe gueſſed that Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court was below, and, endeavouring to aſſume compoſure and to recollect all her ſpirits, ſhe roſe and left the apartment; but on reaching the door of the library, where ſhe imagined him to be, her emotion returned with ſuch energy, that, fearing to truſt her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the room, ſhe returned into the hall, where ſhe continued for a conſiderable time, unable to command her agitated ſpirits.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe could recall them, ſhe found in the library Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court, ſeated with the Count, who both roſe on her entrance; but ſhe did not dare to look at Valancourt, and the Count, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing led her to a chair, immediately withdrew.</p>
                     <p>Emily remained with her eyes fixed on the floor, under ſuch oppreſſion of heart, that ſhe could not ſpeak, and with difficulty breathed; while Valancourt threw himſelf into a chair beſide her, and, ſighing heavily, continued ſilent, when, had ſhe raiſed her eyes, ſhe would have perceived the violent emotions, with which he was agitated.</p>
                     <p>At length, in a tremulous voice, he ſaid, "I have ſolicited to ſee you this evening, that I might, at leaſt, be ſpared the further torture of ſuſpenſe, which your altered manner had occaſioned me, and which the hints I have juſt received from the Count have in part explained. I perceive I have enemies, Emily, who envied me my late happineſs, and who have been buſy in ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the means to deſtroy it: I perceive, too, that time <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>His laſt words faltered, and Emily, leſs able to ſpeak than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, continued ſilent.</p>
                     <p>"O what a meeting is this!" exclaimed Valancourt, ſtarting from his ſeat, and pacing the room with hurried ſteps, "what a meeting is this, after our long—long ſeparation!" Again he ſat down, and, after the ſtruggle of a moment, he added in a firm but deſpairing tone, "This is too much—I cannot bear it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Emily, will you not ſpeak to me?"</p>

He covered his face with his hand, as if to conceal his emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and took Emily's, which ſhe did not withdraw. Her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                        </gap> perceived that ſhe was weeping, all his tenderneſs returned, and a gleam of hope appeared to croſs his mind, for he exclaimed, "O! you ſo pity me, then, you do love me! Yes, you are ſtill my own Emily—let me believe thoſe tears, that tell me ſo!"</p>
                     <p>Emily now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> you—but, ought I to think of you with affection? You may remember that yeſter evening I ſaid, I had ſtill ſufficient confidence in your candour to believe, that, when I ſhould requeſt an expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of your words, you would give it. This explanation is now unneceſſary, I underſtand them too well; but prove, at leaſt, that your candour is deſerving of the confidence I give it, when I aſk you, whether you are conſcious of being the ſame eſtimable Valancourt—whom I once loved."</p>
                     <p>"Once loved!" cried he,—"the ſame—the ſame!" He pauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in extreme emotion, and then added, in a voice at once ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn, and dejected,—"No—I am not the ſame!—I am loſt—I am no longer worthy of you!"</p>
                     <p>He again concealed his face. Emily was too much affected by this honeſt confeſſion to reply immediately, and, while ſhe ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled to overcome the pleadings of her heart, and to act with the deciſive firmneſs, which was neceſſary for her future peace, ſhe perceived all the danger of truſting long to her reſolution, in the preſence of Valancourt, and was anxious to conclude an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, that tortured them both; yet, when ſhe conſidered, that this was probably their laſt meeting, her fortitude ſunk at once, and ſhe experienced only emotions of tenderneſs and of deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency.</p>
                     <p>Valancourt, meanwhile, loſt in emotions of remorſe and grief, which he had neither the power, or the will to expreſs, ſat inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible almoſt of the preſence of Emily, his features ſtill concealed, and his breaſt agitated by convulſive ſighs.</p>
                     <p>"Spare me the neceſſity," ſaid Emily, recollecting her forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, "ſpare me the neceſſity of mentioning thoſe circumſtances of your conduct, which oblige me to break our connection for ever. We muſt part, I now ſee you for the laſt time."</p>
                     <p>"Impoſſible!" cried Valancourt, rouſed from his deep ſilence. "You cannot mean what you ſay!—you cannot mean to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> me from you for ever!"</p>
                     <p>"We muſt part," repeated Emily, with emphaſis, "and that for ever! Your own conduct has made this neceſſary."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="75" facs="unknown:029378_0264_0FE08640C6A293F0"/>
"This is the Count's determination," ſaid he haughtily, "not yours, and I ſhall inquire by what authority he interferes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us." He now roſe, and walked about the room in great emotion.</p>
                     <p>"Let me ſave you from this error," ſaid Emily, not leſs agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, "it is my determination, and, if you reflect a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> on your late conduct, you will perceive, that my future peace requires it."</p>
                     <p>"Your future peace requires, that we ſhould part! part for ever!" ſaid Valancourt, "How little did I ever expect to hear you ſay ſo!"</p>
                     <p>"And how little did I expect, that it would be neceſſary for me to ſay ſo!" rejoined Emily, while her voice ſoftened into tenderneſs, and her tears flowed again.—"That you—you; Valancourt, would ever fall from my eſteem!"</p>
                     <p>He was ſilent a moment, as if overwhelmed by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of no longer deſerving this eſteem, as well as the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of having loſt it, and then, with impaſſioned grief, lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the criminality of his late conduct and the miſery to which it had reduced him, till, overcome by a recollection of the paſt and a conviction of the future, he burſt into tears, and uttered only deep and broken ſighs.</p>
                     <p>The remorſe he had expreſſed, and the diſtreſs he ſuffered could not be witneſſed by Emily with indifference, and, had ſhe not called to her recollection all the circumſtances, of which Count De Villefort had informed her, and all he had ſaid of the danger of confiding in repentance, formed under the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of paſſion, ſhe might, perhaps, have truſted to the aſſurances of her heart, and have forgotten his miſconduct in the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which that repentance excited.</p>
                     <p>Valancourt, returning to the chair beſide her, at length, ſaid, in a calm voice," 'Tis true, I am fallen—fallen from my own eſteem! but could you, Emily, ſo ſoon, ſo ſuddenly reſign, if you had not before ceaſed to love me, or, if your conduct was not governed by the deſigns, I will ſay, the ſelfiſh deſigns of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other perſon! Would you not otherwiſe be willing to hope for my reformation—and could you bear, by eſtranging me from you, to abandon me to miſery—to myſelf!"—Emily wept aloud. "No, Emily—no—you would not do this, if you ſtill loved me. You would find your own happineſs in ſaving mine."</p>
                     <p>"There are too many probabilities againſt that hope," ſaid Emily, "to juſtify me in truſting the comfort of my whole

life to it. May I not alſo aſk, whether you could wiſh me to do this, if you really loved me?"</p>
                     <p>"Really loved you!" exclaimed Valancourt—"is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you can doubt my love! Yet it is reaſonable, that you ſhould do ſo, ſince you ſee, that I am leſs ready to ſuffer the horror of parting with you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> than, that of involving you in my ruin. Yes, Emily, I am ruined, irreparably ruined! I am involved in debts, which I can never diſcharge!" Valancourt's look, which was wild, as he ſpoke this, ſoon ſettled into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of gloomy deſpair; and Emily, while ſhe was compell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to admire his ſincerity, ſaw, with unutterable anguiſh, new reaſons for fear in the ſuddenneſs of his feelings and the extent of the miſery, in which they might involve him. After ſome minutes, ſhe ſeemed to contend againſt her grief and to ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle for fortitude to conclude the interview. "I will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long theſe moments," ſaid ſhe, "by a converſation, which can anſwer no good purpoſe. Valancourt, farewel!"</p>
                     <p>"You are not going?" ſaid he, wildly interrupting her, "you will not leave me thus—you will not abondon me even before my mind has ſuggeſted any poſſibility of compromiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the laſt indulgence of my deſpair and the endurance of my loſs!" Emily was terrified by the ſternneſs of his look, and ſaid, in a ſoothing voice, "You have yourſelf acknowledged, that it is neceſſary we ſhould par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>;—if you wiſh, that I ſhould believe you love me, you will repeat the acknowledgement."—"Never—never," cried <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e—"I was diſtracted when I made it. O <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> Emily, this is too much; though you are not deceived as to my faults, you muſt be deluded into this exaſperation againſt them. The Count is the barrier between us; but he ſhall not long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſo."</p>
                     <p>"You are, indeed, diſtracted," ſaid Emily, "the Count is not your enemy; on the contrary, he is my friend, and that might, in ſome degree, induce you to conſider him as yours." "Your friend!" ſaid Valancourt, haſtily, "how long has he been your friend, that he can ſo eaſily make you forget your lover? Was it he, who recommended to your favour the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Du Pont, who, you ſay, accompanied you from Italy, and who, I ſay, has ſtolen your affections? But I have no right to queſtion you; you are your own miſtreſs. Du Pont, perhaps, may not long triumph over my fallen fortunes!" Emily, more frightened than before by the frantic looks of Valancourt, ſaid, in a tone ſcarcely audible, "For heaven's ſake be reaſonable, be compoſed. Monſieur Du Pont is not your rival, nor is th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Count his advocate. You have no rival; nor, except yourſelf, an enemy. My heart is wrung with anguiſh, which muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe while your frantic behaviour ſhews me, more than ever, that you are no longer the Valancourt I have been accuſtomed to love."</p>
                     <p>He made no reply, but ſat with his arms reſted on the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and his face concealed by his hands; while Emily ſtood, ſilent and trembling, wretched for herſelf and dreading to leave him in this ſtate of mind.</p>
                     <p>"O exceſs of miſery!" he ſuddenly exclaimed, "that I can never lament my ſufferings, without accuſing myſelf, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you, without recollecting the folly and the vice, by which I have loſt you! Why was I forced to Paris, and why did I yield to allurements, which were to make me deſpicable for ever! O! why cannot I look back, without interruption, to thoſe days of innocence and peace, the days of our early love!" The recollection ſeemed to melt his heart, and the frenzy of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair yielded to tears. After a long pauſe, turning towards her and taking her hand, he ſaid, in a ſoftened voice, "Emily, can you bear that we ſhould part, can you reſolve to give up a heart, that loves you like mine, an heart, which, though it has erred, widely erred, is not irretrievable from error, as you well know, it never can be retrievable from love?" Emily made no reply but with her tears. "Can you," continued he, "can you forget all our former days of happineſs and confidence, when I had not a thought, that I might wiſh to conceal from you, when I had no taſte, no pleaſures, in which you did not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate?"</p>
                     <p>"O do not lead me to the remembrance of thoſe days," ſaid Emily, "unleſs you can teach me to forget the preſent; I do not mean to reproach you; if I did, I ſhould be ſpared theſe tears; but why will you render your preſent ſufferings more conſpicuous, by contraſting them with your former virtues?"</p>
                     <p>"Thoſe virtues," ſaid Valancourt, "might, perhaps, again be mine, if your affection, which nurtured them, was unchanged; but I fear, indeed, I ſee, that you can no longer love me; elſe the happy hours, which we have paſſed together, would plead for me, and you could not look back upon them unmoved. Yet, why ſhould I torture myſelf with the remembrance, why do I linger here? Am I not ruined, would it not be madneſs to inv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>e you in my misfortunes, even if your heart was ſtill my own? I will not diſtreſs you further. Yet, before I go," added he, in a ſolemn voice, "let me repeat, that, whatever may be
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:029378_0266_0FE06980B8EBFDB0"/>
my deſtiny, whatever I may be doomed to ſuffer, I muſt always love you, moſt fondly love you! I am going, Emily, I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to leave you, to leave you, for ever!" As he ſpoke the laſt words, his voice trembled, and he threw himſelf again into the chair, from which he had riſen. Emily was utterly unable to leave the room, or to ſay farewel. All impreſſion of his crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inal conduct and almoſt of his follies was obliterated from her mind, and ſhe was ſenſible only of pity and grief.</p>
                     <p>"My fortitude is gone," ſaid Valancourt at length; "I can no longer even ſtruggle to recall it. I cannot now leave you, I cannot bid you an eternal farewel; ſay, as leaſt, that you will ſee me once again." Emily's heart was ſomewhat relieved by the requeſt, and ſhe endeavoured to believe, that ſhe ought not to refuſe it. Yet ſhe was embarraſſed by recollecting, that ſhe was a viſitor in the houſe of the Count, who could not be pleaſed by the return of Valancourt. Other conſiderations, however, ſoon overcame this, and ſhe granted his requeſt, on the condition, that he would neither think of the Count, as his enemy, nor Du Pont as his rival. He then left her, with a heart ſo much lightened by this ſhort reſpite, that he almoſt loſt every former ſenſe of misfortune.</p>
                     <p>Emily withdrew to her own room, that ſhe might compoſe her ſpirits and remove the traces of her tears, which would encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the cenſorious remarks of the Counteſs and her favourite, as well as excite the curioſity of the reſt of the family. She found it, however, impoſſible to tranquillize her mind, from which ſhe could not expel the remembrance of the late ſcene with Valancourt, or the conſciouſneſs, that ſhe was to ſee him again, on the morrow. This meeting now appeared more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to her than the laſt, for the ingenuous confeſſion he had made of his ill conduct and his embarraſſed circumſtances, with the ſtrength and tenderneſs of affection, which this confeſſion diſcovered, had deeply impreſſed her, and, in ſpite of all ſhe had heard and believed to his diſadvantage, her eſteem began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. It frequently appeared to her impoſſible, that he could have been guilty of the depravities reported of him, which, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> not inconſiſtent with his warmth and impetuoſity, were entirely ſo with his candour and ſenſibility. Whatever was the crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality, which had given riſe to the reports, ſhe could not now believe them to be wholly true, nor that his heart was finally cloſed againſt the charms of virtue. The deep conſciouſneſs, which he felt as well as expreſſed of his errors, ſeemed to juſtify the opinion; and, as ſhe underſtood not the inſtability of youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

diſpoſitions, when oppoſed by habit, and that profeſſions fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently deceive thoſe, who make, as well as thoſe, who hear them, ſhe might have yielded to the flattering perſuaſions of her own heart and the pleadings of Valancourt, had ſhe not been guided by the ſuperior prudence of the Count. He repreſented to her, in a clear light, the danger of her preſent ſituation, that of liſtening to promiſes of amendment, made under the influence of ſtrong paſſion, and the flight hope, which could attach to a connection, whoſe chance of happineſs reſted upon the retrieval of ruined circumſtances and the reform of corrupted habits. On theſe accounts, he lamented, that Emily had conſented to a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond interview, for he ſaw how much it would ſhake her reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and increaſe, the difficulty of her conqueſt.</p>
                     <p>Her mind was now ſo entirely occupied by nearer intereſts, that ſhe forgot the old houſekeeper and the promiſed hiſtory, which ſo lately had excited her curioſity, but which Dorothee was probably not very anxious to diſcloſe, for night came, the hours paſſed; and ſhe did not appear in Emily's chamber. With the latter it was a ſleepleſs and diſmal night; the more ſhe ſuffered her memory to dwell on the late ſcenes with Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court, the more her reſolution declined, and ſhe was obliged to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>collect all the arguments, which the Count had made uſe of to ſtrengthen it, and all the precepts, which ſhe had received from her deceaſed father, on the ſubject of ſelf command, to enable her to act, with prudence and dignity, on this the moſt ſevere occaſion of her life. There were moments, when all her forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude forſook her, and when, remembering the confidence of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, ſhe thought it impoſſible, that ſhe could renounce Valancourt. His reformation then appeared certain; the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of Count De Villefort were forgotten; ſhe readily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved all ſhe wiſhed, and was willing to encounter any evil rather than that of an immediate ſeparation.</p>
                     <p>Thus paſſed the night in ineffectual ſtruggles between affection and reaſon, and ſhe roſe, in the morning, with a mind, weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and irreſolute, and a frame, trembling with illneſs.</p>

                     <p>VALANCOURT, meanwhile, ſuffered the tortures of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe and deſpair. The ſight of Emily had renewed all the ardour, with which he firſt loved her, and which had ſuffered a temporary abatement from abſence and the paſſing ſcenes of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy life. When, on the receipt of her letter, he ſet out for Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc, he then knew, that his own folly had involved him in ruin, and it was no part of his deſign to conceal this from her. But he lamented only the delay which his ill conduct muſt give to their marriage, and did not foreſee, that the information could induce her to break their connection for ever. While the proſpect of this ſeparation overwhelmed his mind, before ſtung with ſelf reproach, he awaited their ſecond interview, in a ſtate little ſhort of diſtraction, yet was ſtill inclined to hope, that his pleadings might prevail upon her not to exact it. In the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he ſent to know at what hour ſhe would ſee him; and his note arrived, when ſhe was with the Count, who had ſought a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> opportunity of again converſing with her of Valancourt; for he perceived the extreme diſtreſs of her mind, and feared, more than ever, that her fortitude would deſert her. Emily having diſmiſſed the meſſenger, the Count returned to the ſubject of their late converſation, urging his fear of Valancourt's entreaties, and again pointing out to her the lengthened miſery, that muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, if ſhe ſhould refuſe to encounter ſome preſent uneaſineſs. His repeated arguments could, indeed, alone have protected her from the affection ſhe ſtill felt for Valancourt, and ſhe reſolved to be governed by them.</p>
                     <p>The hour of interview, at length, arrived. Emily went to it, at leaſt, with compoſure of manner, but Valancourt was ſo much agitated, that he could not ſpeak, for ſeveral minutes, and his firſt words were alternately thoſe of lamentation, entreaty and ſelf reproach. Afterward, he ſaid, "Emily, I have loved you, I do love you better than my life; but I am ruined by my own conduct. Yet I would ſeek to entangle you in a connection, that muſt be miſerable for you, rather than ſubject myſelf to the puniſhment which is my due, the loſs of you. I am a wretch, but I will be a villain no longer. I will not endeavour to ſhake your reſolution by the pleadings of a ſelfiſh paſſion. I reſign you, Emily, and will endeavour to find conſolation in conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:029378_0267_0FE086582F9EFE88"/>
that, though I am miſerable, you at leaſt may be happy. The merit of the ſacrifice is, indeed, not my own, for I ſhould never, have attained ſtrength of mind to ſurrender you, if your prudence had not demanded it."</p>
                     <p>He pauſed a moment, while Emily attempted to conceal the tears, which came to her eyes. She would have ſaid, "You ſpeak now, as you were wont to do," but ſhe checked herſelf—"Forgive me, Emily," ſaid he, "all the ſufferings I have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned you, and ſometimes, when you think of the wretched Valancourt, remember, that his only conſolation would be to believe, that you are no longer unhappy by his folly." The tears now fell faſt upon her cheek, and he was relapſing into the phrenzy of deſpair, when Emily endeavoured to recall her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and to terminate an interview, which only ſeemed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the diſtreſs of both. Perceiving her tears and that ſhe was riſing to go, Valancourt, ſtruggled, once more, to overcome his own feelings and to ſooth hers. "The remembrance of this ſorrow," ſaid he, "ſhall in future be my protection, O! never again will example, or temptation have power to ſeduce me to evil, exalted as I ſhall be by the recollection of your grief for me."</p>
                     <p>Emily was ſomewhat comforted by this aſſurance. "We are now parting for ever," ſaid ſhe; "but, if my happineſs is dear to you, you will always remember, that nothing can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to it more than to believe, that you have recovered your own eſteem." Valancourt took her hand; his eyes were cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered with tears, and the farewel he would have ſpoken was loſt in ſighs. After a few moments, Emily ſaid with difficulty and emotion, "Farewel, Valancourt, may you be happy!" She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated her "farewel," and attempted to withdraw her hand, but he ſtill held it and bathed it with his tears. "Why pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long theſe moments?" ſaid Emily, in a voice ſcarcely audible, "they are too painful to us both." "This is too, too much," exclaimed Valancourt, reſigning her hand and throwing himſelf into a chair, where he covered his face with his hands, and was overcome, for ſome moments, by convulſive ſighs. After a long pauſe, during which Emily wept in ſilence, and Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court ſeemed ſtruggling with his grief, ſhe again roſe to take leave of him. Then, endeavouring to recover his compoſure, "I am again afflicting you," ſaid he, "but let the anguiſh I ſuffer, plead for me." He then added, in a ſolemn voice, which frequently trembled with the agitation of his heart, "Farewel,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:029378_0268_0FE0865F0A87F028"/>
Emily, you will always be the only object of my tenderneſs. Sometimes you will think of the unhappy Valancourt, and it will be with pity, though it may not be with eſteem. O! what is the whole world to me, without you, without your eſteem!" He checked himſelf, "I am falling again into the error I have juſt lamented. I muſt not intrude longer upon your patience, or I ſhall relapſe into deſpair."</p>
                     <p>He once more bade Emily adieu, preſſed her hand to his lips, looked at her, for the laſt time, and hurried out of the room.</p>
                     <p>Emily remained in the chair, where he had left her, oppreſſed with a pain at her heart, which ſcarcely permitted her to breathe, and liſtening to his departing ſteps, ſinking fainter and fainter, as he croſſed the hall. She was at length rouſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> by the voice of the Counteſs in the garden, and, her attention being then awakened, the firſt object which ſtruck her ſight, was the vacant chair, where Valancourt had ſat. The tears, which had been, for ſometime, repreſſed by the kind of aſtoniſhment, that followed his departure, now came to her relief, and ſhe was at length, ſufficiently compoſed to return to her own room.</p>

                     <p>WE now return to the mention of Montoni, whoſe rage and diſappointment were ſoon loſt in nearer intereſts, than any, which the unhappy Emily had awakened. His depredations hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exceeded their uſual limits, and reached an extent, at which neither the timidity of the then commercial ſenate of Venice, nor their hope of his occaſional aſſiſtance would permit them to connive, the ſame effort, it was reſolved, ſhould complete the ſuppreſſion of his power and the correction of his outrages. While a corps of conſiderable ſtrength was upon the point of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving orders to march for Udolpho, a young officer, prompted partly by reſentment, for ſome injury, received from Montoni, and partly by the hope of diſtinction, ſolicited an interview with the Miniſter who directed the enterpriſe. To him he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, that the ſituation of Udolpho rendered it too ſtrong to be
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:029378_0268_0FE0865F0A87F028"/>
taken by open force, except after ſome tedious operations; that Montoni had lately ſhewn how capaple he was of adding to its ſtrength all the advantages, which could be derived from the ſkill of a commander; that ſo conſiderable a body of troops, as that allotted to the expedition, could not approach Udolpho with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his knowledge, and that it was not for the honour of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public to have a large part of its regular force employed, for ſuch a time as the ſiege of Udolpho would require, upon the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack of a handful of banditti. The object of the expedition, he thought, might be accompliſhed much more ſafely and ſpeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily by mingling contrivance with force. It was poſſible to meet Montoni and his party, without their walls, and to attack them then; or, by approaching the fortreſs, with the ſecrecy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the march of ſmaller bodies of troops, to take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage either of the treachery, or negligence of ſome of his party, and to ruſh unexpectedly upon the whole, even in the caſtle of Udolpho.</p>
                     <p>This advice was ſeriouſly attended to, and the officer who gave it, received the command of the troops, demanded for his purpoſe. His firſt efforts were accordingly thoſe of contrivance alone. In the neighbourhood of Udolpho, he waited, till he had ſecured the aſſiſtance of ſeveral of the condottieri, of whom he found none, that he addreſſed, unwilling to puniſh their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious maſter, and to ſecure their own pardon from the ſenate. He learned alſo the number of Montoni's troops, and that it had been much increaſed, ſince his late ſucceſſes. The concluſion of his plan was ſoon effected. Having returned with his party, who received the watch word and other aſſiſtance from their friends within, Montoni and his officers were ſurpriſed by one diviſion, who had been directed to their apartment, while the other main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the ſlight combat, which preceded the ſurrender of the whole garriſon. Among the perſons, ſeized with Montoni, was Orſino, the aſſaſſin, who had joined him on his firſt arrival at Udolpho, and whoſe concealment had been made known to the ſenate by Count Morano, after the unſucceſsful attempt of the latter to carry off Emily. It was, indeed, partly for the purpoſe of capturing this man, by whom one of the ſenate had been murdered, that the expedition was undertaken, and its ſucceſs was ſo acceptable to them, that Morano was inſtantly releaſed, notwithſtanding the political ſuſpicions, which Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni, by his ſecret accuſation, had excited againſt him. The celerity and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aſe, with which this whole tranſaction was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted, prevented it from attracting curioſity, or even from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:029378_0269_0FE0866A22F3C100"/>
a place in any of the publiſhed records of that time; ſo that Emily, who remained in Languedoc, was ignorant of the defeat and ſignal humiliation of her late perſecutor.</p>
                     <p>Her mind was now occupied with ſufferings, which no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of reaſon had yet been able to controul. Count de Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, who ſincerely attempted whatever benevolence could ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt for ſoftening them, ſometimes allowed her the ſolitude ſhe wiſhed for, ſometimes led her into friendly parties, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly protected her, as much as poſſible, from the ſhrewd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries and critical converſation of the Counteſs. He often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited her to make excurſions, with him and his daughter, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which he converſed entirely on queſtions, ſuitable to her taſte, without appearing to conſult it, and thus endeavoured grad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually to withdraw her from the ſubject of her grief, and to awake other intereſts in her mind. Emily, to whom he appeared as the enlightened friend and protector of her youth, ſoon felt for him the render affection of a daughter, and her heart expanded to her young friend Blanche, as to a ſiſter, whoſe kindneſs and ſimplicity compenſated for the want of more brilliant qualities. It was long before ſhe could ſufficiently abſtract her mind from Valancourt to liſten to the ſtory, promiſed by old Doro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thee, concerning which her curioſity had once been ſo deeply intereſted; but Dorothee, at length reminded her of it, and Emily deſired that ſhe would come that night to her chamber.</p>
                     <p>Still her thoughts were employed by conſiderations, which weakened her curioſity, and Dorothee's tap at the door, ſoon after twelve, ſurpriſed her almoſt as much as if it had not been appointed. "I am come, at laſt, lady," ſaid ſhe; "I wonder what it is makes my old limbs ſhake ſo, to night. I thought once, or twice, I ſhould have dropped, as I was a coming." Emily ſeated her in a chair, and deſired, that ſhe would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe her ſpirits, before ſhe entered upon the ſubject, that had brought her thither. "Alas," ſaid Dorothee, "it is thinking of that, I believe, which has diſturbed me ſo. In my way hither too, I paſſed the chamber, where my dear lady died, and every thing was ſo ſtill and gloomy about me, that I almoſt fancied I ſaw her as ſhe appeared upon her death bed."</p>
                     <p>Emily now drew the chair near to Dorothee, who went on. "It is about twenty years ſince my lady Marchioneſs came a bride to the chateau. O! I well remember how ſhe looked, when ſhe came into the great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, where we ſervants were all aſſembled to welcome her, and how happy my lord the Marquis ſeemed. Ah! who would have thought then!—But, as I was
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:029378_0269_0FE0866A22F3C100"/>
ſaying, ma'amſelle, I thought the Marchioneſs, with all her ſweet looks, did not look happy at heart, and ſo I told my huſband, and he ſaid it was all fancy; ſo I ſaid no more, but I made my remarks, for all that. My lady Marchioneſs was then about your age, and, as I have often thought, very like you. Well! my lord the Marquis kept open houſe, for a long time, and gave ſuch entertainments and there were ſuch gay doings as have never been in the chateau ſince. I was younger, ma'amſelle, then, than I am now, and was as gay as the beſt of them. I remember I danced with Philip, the butler, in a pink gown, with yellow rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bons, and a coif, not ſuch as they wear now, but plaited high, with ribbons all about it. It was very becoming truly;—my lord, the Marquis, noticed me. Ah! he was a good natured gentleman then—who would have thought that he!"—</p>
                     <p>"But the Marchioneſs, Dorothee," ſaid Emily, "you was telling me of her."</p>
                     <p>"O yes, my lady Marchioneſs, I thought ſhe did not ſeem to be happy at heart, and once, ſoon after the marriage, I caught her crying in her chamber; but, when ſhe ſaw me, ſhe dried her eyes, and pretended to ſmile. I did not dare then to aſk what was the matter; but, the next time I ſaw her crying, I did, and ſhe ſeemed diſpleaſed; ſo I ſaid no more. I found out, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time after, how it was. Her father, it ſeems, had commanded her to marry my lord, the Marquis, for his money, and there was another nobleman, or elſe a chevalier, that ſhe liked better and that was very fond of her, and ſhe fretted for the loſs of him, I fancy, but ſhe never told me ſo. My lady always tried to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal her tears from the Marquis, for I have often ſeen her, after ſhe has been ſo ſorrowful, look ſo calm and ſweet, when he came into the room! But my lord, all of a ſudden, grew gloomy, fretful, and very unkind, ſometimes to my lady. This afflicted her very much, as I ſaw, for ſhe never complained, and ſhe uſed to try ſo ſweetly to oblige him and to bring him into a good humour, that my heart has often ached to ſee it. But he uſed to be ſtubborn, and give her harſh anſwers, and then, when ſhe found it all in vain, ſhe would go to her own room, and cry ſo! I uſed to hear her in the anti room, poor dear lady! but I ſeldom ventured to go to her. I uſed, ſometimes, to think my lord was jealous. To be ſure my lady was greatly admired, but ſhe was too good to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſuſpicion. Among the many chevaliers, that viſited at the chateau, there was one, that I always thought ſeemed juſt ſuited for my lady; he was ſo courteous, yet ſo ſpirited, and there was ſuch a grace, as it were, in all he did, or ſaid. I always obſerved,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:029378_0270_0FE0866FEDC210C8"/>
that, whenever he had been there, the Marquis was more gloomy and my lady more thoughtful, and it came into my head, that this was the chevalier ſhe ought to have married, but I never could learn for certain."</p>
                     <p>"What was the chevalier's name, Dorothee?" ſaid Emily.</p>
                     <p>"Why that I will not tell even to you, ma'amſelle, for evil may come of it. I once heard from a perſon, who is ſince dead, that the Marchioneſs was not in law the wife of the Marquis, for that ſhe had before been privately married to the gentleman ſhe was ſo much attached to, and was afterwards afraid to own it to her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who was a very ſtern man; but this ſeems very unlikely, and I never gave much faith to it. As I was ſaying, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis was moſt out of humour, as I thought, when the chevalier I ſpoke of had been at the chateau, and, at laſt, his ill treatment of my lady made her quite miſerable. He would ſee hardly any viſitors at the caſtle, and made her live almoſt by herſelf. I was her conſtant attendant, and ſaw all ſhe ſuffered, but ſtill ſhe never complained.</p>
                     <p>"After matters had gone on thus, for near a year, my lady was taken ill, and I thought her long fretting had made her ſo; but, alas! I fear it was worſe than that."</p>
                     <p>"Worſe! Dorothee," ſaid Emily, "can that be poſſible?"</p>
                     <p>"I fear it was ſo, madam, there were ſtrange appearances! But I will only tell what happened. My lord, the Marquis—"</p>
                     <p>"Huſh, Dorothee, what ſounds were thoſe?" ſaid Emily.</p>
                     <p>Dorothee changed countenance, and, while they both liſtened, they heard, on the ſtillneſs of the night, muſic of uncommon ſweetneſs.</p>
                     <p>"I have ſurely heard that voice before!" ſaid Emily, at length.</p>
                     <p>"I have often heard it, and at this ſame hour," ſaid Doro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thee, ſolemnly, "and, if ſpirits ever bring muſic—that is ſurely the muſic of one!"</p>
                     <p>Emily, as the ſounds drew nearer, knew them to be the ſame ſhe had formerly heard at the time of her father's death, and, whether it was the remembrance they now revived of that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy event, or that ſhe was ſtruck with ſuperſtitious awe, it is certain, ſhe was ſo much affected, that ſhe had nearly fainted.</p>
                     <p>"I think I once told you, madam," ſaid Dorothee, "that I firſt heard this muſic, ſoon after my lady's death! I well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the night!"—</p>
                     <p>"Hark! it comes again!" ſaid Emily, "let us open the window, and liſten."</p>
                     <p>They did ſo; but, ſoon, the ſounds floated gradually away into diſtance, and all was again ſtill; they ſeemed to have ſunk
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:029378_0270_0FE0866FEDC210C8"/>
among the woods, whoſe tufted tops were viſible upon the clear horizon, while every other feature of the ſcene was involved in the night ſhade, which, however, allowed the eye an indiſtinct view of ſome objects in the garden below.</p>
                     <p>As Emily leaned on the window, gazing with a kind of thril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling awe upon the obſcurity beneath, and then upon the cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs arch above, enlightened only by the ſtars, Dorothee, in a low voice, reſumed her narrative.</p>
                     <p>"I was ſaying, ma'amſelle, that I well remember when firſt I heard that muſic. It was one night, ſoon after my lady's death, that I had ſat up later than uſual, and I don't know how it was, but I had been thinking a great deal about my poor miſtreſs, and of the ſad ſcene I had lately witneſſed. The cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau was quite ſtill, and I was in a chamber at a good diſtance from the reſt of the ſervants, and this, with the mournful things I had been thinking of, I ſuppoſe, made me low ſpirited, for I felt very lonely and forlorn, as it were, and liſtened often, wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to hear a ſound in the chateau, for you know, ma'amſelle, when one can hear people moving, one does not ſo much mind, about one's fears. But all the ſervants were gone to bed, and I ſat thinking and thinking, till I was almoſt afraid to look round the room and my poor lady's countenance often came to my mind, ſuch as I had ſeen her when ſhe was dying, and, once or twice, I almoſt thought I ſaw her before me,—when ſuddenly I heard ſuch ſweet muſic! it ſeemed juſt at my window, and I ſhall never forget what I felt. I had not power to move from my chair, but then when I thought it was my dear lady's voice, the tears came to my eyes. I had often heard her ſing, in her lifetime, and to be ſure ſhe had a very fine voice; it had made me cry to hear her many a time, when ſhe has ſat in her oriel, of an even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, playing upon her lute ſuch ſad ſongs, and ſinging ſo. O! it went to ones heart! I have liſtened in the anti chamber, for the hour together, and ſhe would ſometimes ſit playing with the window open, when it was ſummer time till it was quite dark, and when I have gone in, to ſhut it, ſhe has hardly ſeemed to know what hour it was. But, as I ſaid, madam, continued Dorothee, "when firſt I heard the muſic, that came juſt now, I thought it was my late lady's, and I have often thought ſo again, when I have heard it, as I have done at intervals, ever ſince. Sometimes, many months have gone by, but ſtill it has returned."</p>
                     <p>"It is extraordinary," obſerved Emily, "that no perſon has yet diſcovered the muſician."</p>
                     <p>"Aye, ma'amſelle, if it had been any thing earthly it would have been diſcovered long ago, but who could have courage to
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:029378_0271_0FE08679A9ECFC88"/>
follow a ſpirit, and if they had, what good could it do?—for ſpirits <hi>you know,</hi> ma'am, can take any ſhape, or no ſhape, and they will be here, one minute, and, the next perhaps, in a quite different place!"</p>
                     <p>"Pray reſume your ſtory of the Marchioneſs," ſaid Emily, "and acquaint me with the manner of her death."</p>
                     <p>"I will, ma'am," ſaid Dorothee, "but ſhall we leave the window?"</p>
                     <p>"This cool air refreſhes me," replied Emily, "and I love to hear it creep along the woods, and to look upon this duſky landſcape. You was ſpeaking of my lord, the Marquis, when the muſic interrupted us."</p>
                     <p>"Yes, madam, my lord, the Marquis, became more and more gloomy; and my lady grew worſe and worſe, till one night, ſhe was taken very ill, indeed. I was called up, and, when I came to her bed ſide, I was ſhocked to ſee her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance—it was ſo changed! She looked piteouſly up at me, and deſired I would call the Marquis again, for he was not yet come, and tell him ſhe had ſomething particular to ſay to him. At laſt, he came, and he did, to be ſure, ſeem very ſorry to ſee her, but he ſaid very little. My lady told him ſhe felt herſelf to be dying, and wiſhed to ſpeak with him alone, and then I left the room, but I ſhall never forget his look as I went."</p>
                     <p>"When I returned, I ventured to remind my lord about ſending for a doctor, for I ſuppoſed he had forgot to do ſo, in his grief; but my lady ſaid it was then too late; but my lord ſo far from thinking ſo, ſeemed to think lightly of her diſorder—till ſhe was ſeized with ſuch terrible pains! O, I never ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get her ſhriek! My lord then ſent off a man and horſe for the doctor, and walked about the room and all over the chateau, in the greateſt diſtreſs; and I ſtaid by my dear lady, and did what I could to eaſe her ſufferings. She had intervals of eaſe, and in one of theſe ſhe ſent for my lord again; when he came, I was going, but ſhe deſired I would not leave her. O! I ſhall never forget what a ſcene paſſed—I can hardly bear to think of it now! my lord was almoſt diſtracted, for my lady behaved with ſo much goodneſs, and took ſuch pains to comfort him, that, if he ever had ſuffered a ſuſpicion to enter his head, he muſt now have been convinced he was wrong. And to be ſure he did ſeem to be overwelmed with the thought of his treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her and this affected her ſo much that ſhe fainted away.</p>
                     <p>"We then got my lord out of the room; he went into his library, and threw himſelf on the floor, and there he ſtaid, and
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:029378_0271_0FE08679A9ECFC88"/>
would hear no reaſon, that was talked to him. When my lady recovered, ſhe inquired for him, but, afterwards, ſaid ſhe could not bear to ſee his grief, and deſired we would let her die quietly. She died in my arms, ma'amſelle, and ſhe went off as peacefully as a child, for all the violence of her diſorder was paſſed."</p>
                     <p>Dorothee pauſed, and wept, and Emily wept with her; for ſhe was much affected by the goodneſs of the late Marchioneſs, and by the meek patience, with which ſhe had ſuffered.</p>
                     <p>"When the doctor came," reſumed Dorothee, "alas! he came too late; he appeared greatly ſhocked to ſee her, for ſoon after her death a frightful blackneſs ſpread all over her face. When he had ſent the attendants out of the room, he aſked me ſeveral odd queſtions about the Marchioneſs, particularly concerning the manner, in which ſhe had been ſeized, and he often ſhook his head at my anſwers, and ſeemed to mean more, than he choſe to ſay. But I underſtood him too well. However, I kept my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks to myſelf, and only told them to my huſband, who bade me hold my tongue. Some of the other ſervants, however, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected what I did, and ſtrange reports were whiſpered about the neighbourhood, but nobody dared to make any ſtir about them. When my lord heard that my lady was dead, he ſhut himſelf up, and would ſee nobody but the doctor, who uſed to be with him alone, ſometimes for an hour together; and, after that, the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor never talked with me again about my lady. When ſhe was burried in the church of the convent, at a little diſtance yonder, if the moon was up you might ſee the towers here, ma'amſelle, all my lord's vaſſals followed the funeral, and there was not a dry eye among them, for ſhe had done a deal of good among the poor. My lord, the Marquis, I never ſaw any body ſo melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly as he was afterwards, and ſometimes he would be in ſuch fits of violence, that we almoſt thought he had loſt his ſenſes. He did not ſtay long at the chateau, but joined his regiment, and, ſoon after, all the ſervants, except my huſband and I, received notice to go, for my lord went to the wars. I never ſaw him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for he would not return to the chateau, though it is ſuch a fine place, and never finiſhed thoſe fine rooms he was building on the weſt ſide of it, and it has, in a manner, been ſhut up ever ſince, till my lord the Count came here."</p>
                     <p>"The death of the Marchioneſs appears extraordinary," ſaid Emily, who was anxious to know more than ſhe dared to aſk.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, madam," replied Dorothee, "it was extraordinary; I have told you all I ſaw, and you may eaſily gueſs what I think,
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:029378_0272_0FE0867F76E90D78"/>
I cannot ſay more, becauſe I would not ſpread reports, that might offend my lord the Count."</p>
                     <p>"You are very right," ſaid Emily;—"where did the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis die?"—"In the north of France, I believe, ma'amſelle," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Dorothee. "I was very glad, when I heard my lord the Count was coming, for this had been a ſad deſolate place, theſe many years, and we heard ſuch ſtrange noiſes, ſometimes, after my lady's death, that as I told you before, my huſband and I left it for a neighbouring cottage. And now, lady, I have told you all this ſad hiſtory, and all my thought<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, and you have promiſed, you know, never to give the leaſt hint about it."—"I have," ſaid Emily, "and I will be faithful to my promiſe, Dorothee;—what you have told has intereſted me more than you can imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine. I only wiſh I could prevail upon you to tell the name of the chevalier, whom you thought ſo deſerving of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs."</p>
                     <p>Dorothee, however, ſteadily refuſed to do this, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the notice of Emily's likeneſs to the late Marchioneſs. "There is another picture of her," added ſhe, "hanging in a room of the ſuite, which was ſhut up. It was drawn, as I have heard, before ſhe was married, and is much more like you than the miniature." When Emily expreſſed a ſtrong deſire to ſee this, Dorothee replied, that ſhe did not like to open thoſe rooms; but Emily reminded her that the Count had talked the other day of or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> them to be opened; of which Dorothee ſeemed to conſider much, and then ſhe owned, that ſhe ſhould feel leſs, if ſhe went into them with Emily firſt, than otherwiſe, and at length promiſed to ſhew the picture.</p>
                     <p>The night was too far advanced and Emily was too much affected by the narrative of the ſcenes, which had paſſed in thoſe apartments, to wiſh to viſit them at this hour, but ſhe requeſted that Dorothee would return on the following night, when they were not likely to be obſerved, and conduct her thither. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides her wiſh to examine the portrait, ſhe felt a thrilling curioſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity to ſee the chamber, in which the Marchioneſs had died, and which Dorothee had ſaid remained, with the bed and furniture, juſt as when the corpſe was removed for interment. The ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emn emotions, which the expectation of viewing ſuch a ſcene had awakened, were in uniſon with the preſent tone of her mind, depreſſed by ſevere diſappointment. Cheerful objects rather added to, than removed this depreſſion; but, perhaps, ſhe yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too much to her melancholy inclination, and imprudently la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the misfortune, which no virtue of her own could have
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:029378_0272_0FE0867F76E90D78"/>
taught her to avoid, though no effort of reaſon could make her look unmoved upon the ſelf degradation of him, whom ſhe had once eſteemed and loved.</p>
                     <p>Dorothee promiſed to return, on the following night, with the keys of the chambers; and then wiſhed Emily, good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and departed. Emily, however, continued at the window, muſing upon the melancholy fate of the Marchioneſs, and liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in awful expectation, for a return of the muſic. But the ſtillneſs of the night remained long unbroken, except by the murmuring founds of the woods, as they waved in the breeze, and then by the diſtant bell of the convent, ſtriking one. She now withdrew from the window, and, as ſhe ſat at her bed ſide, indulging melancholy reveries, which the lonelineſs of the hour aſſiſted, the ſtillneſs was ſuddenly interrupted, not by muſic, but by very uncommon ſounds, that ſeemed to come either from the room, adjoining her own, or from one below. The terrible cataſtrophe, that had been related to her, together with the myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terious circumſtances, ſaid to have ſince occurred in the chateau, had ſo much ſhocked her ſpirits, that ſhe now ſunk, for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under the weakneſs of ſuperſtition. The ſounds, however, did not return, and ſhe retired to forget in ſleep the diſaſterous ſtory ſhe had heard.</p>

                     <p>ON the next night, about the ſame hour as before, Dorothee came to Emily's chamber, with the keys of that ſuite of rooms, which had been particularly appropriated to the late Marchioneſs. Theſe extended along the north ſide of the chateau, forming part of the old building; and, as Emily'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

She, therefore, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted, that Emily would wait half an hour, before they ventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth, that they might be certain all the ſervants were gone to
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:029378_0273_0FE0868D29846EE8"/>
bed. It was nearly one, before the chateau was perfectly ſtill, or Dorothee thought it prudent to leave the chamber. In this interval, her ſpirits ſeemed to be greatly affected by the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of paſt events, and by the proſpect of entering again upon places, where theſe had occurred, and in which ſhe had not been for ſo many years. Emily too was affected, but her feelings had more of ſolemnity, and leſs of fear. From the ſilence, into which reflection and expectation had thrown them, they, at length, rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves, and left the chamber. Dorothee, at firſt, carried the lamp, but her hand trembled ſo much with infirmity and alarm, that Emily took it from her, and offered her arm to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port her feeble ſteps.</p>
                     <p>They had to deſcend the great ſtaircaſe, and, after paſſing over a wide extent of the chateau, to aſcend another which led to the ſuite of rooms they were in queſt of. They ſtepped cautiouſly along the open corridor, that ran round the great hall, and into which the chambers of the Count, Counteſs, and the lady Blanche, opened, and, from thence, deſcending the chief ſtaircaſe, they croſſed the hall itſelf. Proceeding through the ſervants' hall, where the dying embers of a wood fire ſtill glimmered on the hearth, and the ſupper table was ſurrounded by chairs, that obſtructed their paſſage, they came to the foot of the back ſtaircaſe. Old Doro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thee here pauſed, and looked around; "Let us liſten," ſaid ſhe, "if any thing is ſtirring; Ma'amſelle, do you hear any voice?" "None," ſaid Emily, "there certainly is no perſon up in the chateau, beſides ourſelves." "No, ma'amſelle," ſaid Dorothee, "but I have never been here at this hour before, and, after wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>They proceeded, and, having reached the top of the ſtai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, as ſhe endeavoured to turn it, "ſo many years have paſſed ſince this was opened, that I fear it will not move." Emily <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> more ſucceſsful, and they preſently entered a ſpacious and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient chamber.</p>
                     <p>"Alas!" exclaimed Dorothee, as ſhe entered, "the laſt time I paſſed through this door, I followed my poor lady's corpſe!"</p>
                     <p>Emily, ſtruck with the circumſtance, and affected by the duſky and ſolemn air of the apartment, remained ſilent, and they paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on through a long ſuite of rooms, till they came to one more ſpacious than the reſt, and rich in the remains of faded magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="93" facs="unknown:029378_0273_0FE0868D29846EE8"/>
"Let us reſt here, awhile, madam," ſaid Dorothee, faintly, we are going into the chamber, where my lady died! that door opens into it. Ah, ma'amſelle! why did you perſuade me to come?"</p>
                     <p>Emily drew one of the maſſy arm chairs with which the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was furniſhed, and begged Dorothee would ſit down and try to compoſe her ſpirits.</p>
                     <p>"How the ſight of this place brings all that paſſed formerly to my mind!" ſaid Dorothee; "it ſeems as if it was but yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday ſince all that ſad affair happened!"</p>
                     <p>"Hark! what noiſe is that?" ſaid Emily.</p>
                     <p>Dorothee half ſtarting from her chair, looked round the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and they liſtened—but, every thing remaining ſtill, the old woman ſpoke again upon the ſubject of her ſorrow. "This ſaloon, ma'amſelle, was in my lady's time the fineſt apartment in the chateau, and it was fitted up according to her own taſte. All this grand furniture, but you can now hardly ſee what it is for the duſt, and our light is none of the beſt—ah! how I have ſeen this room lighted up in my lady's time!—all this grand furniture came from Paris, and was made after the faſhion of ſome in the Louvre, there, except thoſe large glaſſes, and they came from ſome outlandiſh place, and that rich tapeſtry. How the colours are faded already!—ſince I ſaw it laſt!"</p>
                     <p>"I underſtood, that was twenty years ago," obſerved Emily.</p>
                     <p>"Thereabout, madam," ſaid Dorothee, and well remembered, "but all the time between then and now ſeems as nothing. That tapeſtry uſed to be greatly admired at, it tells the ſtories out of ſome famous book, or other, but I have forgot the name."</p>
                     <p>Emily now roſe to examine the figures it exhibited, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, by verſes in the Provencal tongue, wrought underneath each ſcene, that it exhibited ſtories from ſome of the moſt cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated ancient romances.</p>
                     <p>Dorothee's ſpirits being now more compoſed, ſhe roſe, and unlocked the door that led into the late Marchioneſs's apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Emily paſſed into a lofty chamber, hung round with dark arras, and ſo ſpacious, that the lamp ſhe held up did not ſhew its extent; while Dorothee, when ſhe entered, had drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped into a chair, where, ſighing deeply, ſhe ſcarcely truſted her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the view of a ſcene ſo affecting to her. It was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time before Emily perceived, through the duſk, the bed on which the Marchioneſs was ſaid to have died; when, advancing to the upper end of the room, ſhe diſcovered the high canopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed teſter of dark green damaſk, with the curtains deſcending
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:029378_0274_0FE08691D9DD1418"/>
to the floor in the faſhion of a tent, half drawn, and remaining apparently, as they had been left twenty years before; and over the whole bedding was thrown a counterpane, or pall, of black velvet, that hung down to the floor. Emily ſhuddered, as ſhe held the lamp over it, and looked within the dark curtains, where ſhe almoſt expected to have ſeen a human face, and, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly remembering the horror ſhe had ſuffered upon diſcovering the dying Madame Montoni in the turret chamber of Udolpho, her ſpirits fainted, and ſhe was turning from the bed, when Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rothee, who had now reached it, exclaimed, "Holy Virgin! methinks I ſee my lady ſtretched upon that pall—as when laſt I ſaw her!"</p>
                     <p>Emily, ſhocked by this exclamation looked involuntarily again within the curtains, but the blackneſs of the pall only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; while Dorothee was compelled to ſupport herſelf upon the ſide of the bed, and preſently tears brought her ſome relief.</p>
                     <p>"Ah!" ſaid ſhe, after ſhe had wept awhile, "it was here I ſat on that terrible night, and held my lady's hand, and heard her laſt words, and ſaw all her ſufferings—<hi>here</hi> ſhe died in my arms!"</p>
                     <p>"Do not indulge theſe painful recollections," ſaid Emily, "let us go. Shew me the picture you mentioned, if it will not too much affect you."</p>
                     <p>"It hangs in the oriel," ſaid Dorothee, riſing, and going towards a ſmall door near the bed's head, which ſhe opened, and Emily followed with the light, into the cloſet of the late Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs.</p>
                     <p>"Alas! there ſhe is, ma'amſelle," ſaid Dorothee, pointing to a portrait of a lady, "there is her very ſelf! juſt as ſhe looked when ſhe came firſt to the chateau. You ſee, madam, ſhe was all blooming like you, then—and ſo ſoon to be cut off!"</p>
                     <p>While Dorothee ſpoke, Emily was attentively examining the picture, which bore a ſtrong reſemblance to the miniature, though the expreſſion of the countenance in each was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what different; but, ſtill ſhe thought ſhe perceived ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that penſive melancholy in the portrait, which ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly characteriſed the miniature.</p>
                     <p>"Pray ma'amſelle, ſtand beſide the picture, that I may look at you together," ſaid Dorothee, who, when the requeſt was complied with, exclaimed again at the reſemblance. Emily alſo as ſhe gazed upon it, thought that ſhe had ſomewhere ſeen a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon very like it, though ſhe could not now recollect who this was.</p>
                     <p>In this cloſet were many memorials of the departed Marchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneſs; a robe and ſeveral articles of her dreſs were ſcattered
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:029378_0274_0FE08691D9DD1418"/>
upon the chairs, as if they had juſt been thrown off. On the floor, were a pair of black ſattin ſlippers, and, on the dreſſing table, a pair of gloves and a long black veil, which, as Emily took it up to examine, ſhe perceived was dropping to pieces with age.</p>
                     <p>"Ah!" ſaid Dorothee, obſerving the veil, "my lady's hand laid it there; it has never been moved ſince!"</p>
                     <p>Emily, ſhuddering, immediately laid it down again. "I well remember ſeeing her take it off," continued Dorothee, "it was on the night before her death, when ſhe had returned from a little walk I had perſuaded her to take in the gardens, and ſhe ſeemed refreſhed by it. I told her how much better ſhe looked, and I remember what a languid ſmile ſhe gave me; but, alas! ſhe little thought, or I either, that ſhe was to die, that night."</p>
                     <p>Dorothee wept again, and then, taking up the veil, threw it ſuddenly over Emily, who ſhuddered to find it wrapped round her, deſcending even to her feet, and, as ſhe endeavoured to throw it off. Dorothee intreated that ſhe would keep it on for one moment. "I thought," added ſhe, "how like you would look to my dear miſtreſs in that veil;—may your life ma'amſelle, be a happier one than hers!"</p>
                     <p>Emily, having diſengaged herſelf from the veil, laid it again on the dreſſing table, and ſurveyed the cloſet, where every object, on which her eye fixed, ſeemed to ſpeak of the Marchioneſs. In a large oriel window of painted glaſs, ſtood a table, with a ſilver crucifix, and a prayer book open; and Emily remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with emotion what Dorothee had mentioned concerning her cuſtom of playing on her lute in this window, before ſhe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the lute itſelf, lying on a corner of the table, as if it had been careleſsly placed there by the hand, that had ſo often awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened it.</p>
                     <p>"This is a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ad forlorn place!" ſaid Dorothee, "for, when my dear lady died, I had no heart to put it to rights, or the chamber either; and my lord never came into the rooms after, ſo they remain juſt as they did when my lady was removed for interment."</p>
                     <p>While Dorothee ſpoke, Emily was ſtill looking on the lute which was a Spaniſh one, and remarkably large; and then, with a heſitating hand, ſhe took it up, and paſſed her fingers over the chords. They were out of tune, but uttered a deep and full ſound. Dorothee ſtarted at their well known tones, and, ſeeing the lute in Emily's hand, ſaid, "This is the lute my lady Marchioneſs loved ſo! I remember when laſt ſhe played
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:029378_0275_0FE0869FD0D357B0"/>
upon it—it was on the night that ſhe died. I came as uſual to undreſs her, and, as I entered the bed chamber, I heard the ſound of muſic from the oriel, and perceiving it was my lady's, who was ſitting there, I ſtepped ſoftly to the door, which ſtood a little open, to liſten; for the muſic, though it was mournful, was ſo ſweet! There I ſaw her, with the lute in her hand, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upwards, and the tears fell upon her cheeks, while ſhe ſung a veſper hymn, ſo ſoft and ſo ſolemn! and her voice trembled, as it were, and then ſhe would ſtop for a moment, and wipe away her tears, and go on again, lower than before. O! I had often liſtened to my lady, but never heard any thing ſo ſweet as this; it made me cry, almoſt, to hear it. She had been at prayers, I fancy, for there was the book open on the table be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide her—aye, and there it lies open ſtill! Pray, let us leave the oriel, ma'amſelle," added Dorothee, "this is a heart-breaking place!"</p>
                     <p>Having returned into the chamber, ſhe deſired to look once more upon the bed, when, as they came oppoſite to the open door, leading into the ſaloon, Emily, in the partial gleam, which the lamp threw into it, thought ſhe ſaw ſomething glide along into the obſcurer part of the room. Her ſpirits had been much affected by the ſurrounding ſcene, or it is probable this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, whether real or imaginary, would not have affected her in the degree in did; but ſhe endeavoured to conceal her emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Dorothee, who, however, obſerving her countenance change, inquired if ſhe was ill.</p>
                     <p>"Let us go," ſaid Emily, faintly, "the air of theſe rooms is unwholeſome," but, when ſhe attempted to do ſo, conſidering that ſhe muſt paſs through the apartment where the phantom of her terror had appeared, this terror increaſed, and, too faint to ſupport herſelf, ſhe ſat down on the ſide of the bed.</p>
                     <p>Dorothee, believing that ſhe was only affected by a conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration of the melancholy cataſtrophe, which had happened on this ſpot, endeavoured to cheer her; and then, as they ſat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether on the bed, ſhe began to relate other particulars concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and this without reflecting, that it might increaſe Emily's emotion, but becauſe they were particularly intereſting to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. "A little before my lady's death," ſaid ſhe, "when the pains were gone off, ſhe called me to her, and ſtretching out her hand to me, I ſat down juſt there—where the curtain falls upon the bed. How well I remember her look at the time—death was in it!—I can almoſt fancy I ſee her now.—There ſhe lay, ma'amſelle—her face was upon the pillow there! This black
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:029378_0275_0FE0869FD0D357B0"/>
counterpane was not upon the bed then; it was laid on, after her death, and ſhe was laid out upon it."</p>
                     <p>Emily turned to look within the duſky curtains, as if ſhe could have ſeen the countenance of which Dorothee ſpoke. The edge of the white pillow only appeared above the blackneſs of the pall, but, as her eyes wandered over the pall itſelf, ſhe fancied ſhe ſaw it move. Without ſpeaking, ſhe caught Doro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thee's arm, who, ſurpriſed by the action, and by the look of terror that accompanied it, turned her eyes from Emily to the bed, where, in the next moment ſhe, too, ſaw the pall ſlowly lifted, and fall again.</p>
                     <p>Emily attempted to go, but Dorothee ſtood fixed and gazing upon the bed; and, at length ſaid—"It is only the wind, that waves it, ma'amſelle; we have left all the doors open; ſee how the air waves the lamp, too.—It is only the wind."</p>
                     <p>She had ſcarcely uttered theſe words, when the pall was more violently agitated than before; but Emily, ſomewhat aſhamed of her terrors, ſtepped back to the bed, willing to be convinced that the wind only had occaſioned her alarm; when, as ſhe gazed within the curtains, the pall moved again, and, in the next moment, the apparition of a human countenance roſe above it.</p>
                     <p>Screaming with terror, they both fled, and got out of the chamber as faſt as their trembling limbs would bear them, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open doors of all the rooms, through which they paſſed. When they reached the ſtaircaſe, Dorothee threw open a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber door, where ſome of the female ſervants ſlept, and ſunk breathleſs on the bed; while Emily, deprived of all preſence of mind, made only a feeble attempt to conceal the occaſion of her terror from the aſtoniſhed ſervants; and, though Dorothee, when ſhe could ſpeak, endeavoured to laugh at her own fright, and was joined by Emily, no remonſtrances could prevail with the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, who had quickly taken the alarm, to paſs even the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the night in a room ſo near to theſe terrific chambers.</p>
                     <p>Dorothee having accompanied Emily to her own apartment, they then began to talk over, with ſome degree of coolneſs, the ſtrange circumſtance, that had juſt occurred; and Emily would almoſt have doubted her own perceptions, had not thoſe of Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>othee atteſted their truth. Having now mentioned what ſhe had obſerved in the outer chamber, ſhe aſked the houſekeeper, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe was certain no door had been left unfaſtened, by which a perſon might ſecretly have entered the apartments? Dorothee replied, that ſhe had conſtantly kept the keys of the ſeveral doors
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:029378_0276_0FE086A47A747658"/>
in her own poſſeſſion; that, when ſhe had gone her rounds through the caſtle, as ſhe frequently di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, to examine if all was ſafe, ſhe had tried theſe doors among the reſt, and had always found them faſtened. It was, therefore, impoſſible, ſhe added, that any perſon could have got admittance into the apartments; and, if they could—it was very improbable they ſhould have choſe to ſleep in a place ſo cold and forlorn.</p>
                     <p>Emily obſerved, that their viſit to theſe chambers had, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, been watched, and that ſome perſon, for a frolic, had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them into the rooms, with a deſign to frighten them, and, while they were in the oriel, had taken the opportunity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing himſelf in the bed.</p>
                     <p>Dorothee allowed, that this was poſſible, till ſhe recollected, that, on entering the apartments, ſhe had turned the key of the outer door, and this, which had been done to prevent their viſit being noticed by any of the family, who might happen to be up, muſt effectually have excluded every perſon, except themſelves, from the chambers; and ſhe now perſiſted in affirming, that the ghaſtly countenance ſhe had ſeen was nothing human, but ſome dreadful apparition.</p>
                     <p>Emily was very ſolemnly affected. Of whatever nature might be the appearance ſhe had witneſſed, whether human or ſupernat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural, the fate of the deceaſed Marchioneſs was a truth not to be doubted; and this unaccountable circumſtance, occurring in the very ſcene of her ſufferings, affected Emily's imagination with a ſuperſtitious awe, to which, after having detected the fallacies at Udolpho, ſhe might not have yielded, had ſhe been ignorant of the unhappy ſtory, related by the houſekeeper. Her ſhe now ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly conjured to conceal the occurrence of this night, and to make light of the terror ſhe had already betrayed, that the Count might not be diſtreſſed by reports, which would certainly ſpread alarm and confuſſion among his family. "Time," ſhe added, "may explain this myſterious affair; meanwhile let us watch the event in ſilence."</p>
                     <p>Dorothee readily acquieſced; but ſhe now recollected that ſhe had left all the doors of the north ſuite of rooms open, and, not having courage to return alone to lock even the outer one, Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, after ſome effort ſo far conquered her own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>No ſound diſturbed the ſtillneſs, as they paſſed along the halls and galleries; but, on reaching the foot of the back ſtaircaſe,
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:029378_0276_0FE086A47A747658"/>
Dorothee's reſolution failed again; having, however, pauſed a moment to liſten, and no ſound being heard above, ſhe aſcended, leaving Emily below, and, ſcarcely ſuffering her eye to glance within the firſt chamber, ſhe faſtened the door, which ſhut up the whole ſuite of apartments, and returned to Emily.</p>
                     <p>As they ſtepped along the paſſage, leading into the great hall, a ſound of lamentation was heard, which ſeemed to come from the hall itſelf, and they ſtopped in new alarm to liſten, when Emily, preſently diſtinguiſhed the voice of Annette, whom ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Emily's endeavours to laugh, or to argue her out of theſe terrors, were equally vain, and, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to her diſtreſs, ſhe conſented that ſhe ſhould remain in her room during the night.</p>

                     <p>EMILY's injunctions to Annette to be ſilent on the ſubject of her terror were ineffectual, and the occurrence of the preceding night ſpread ſuch alarm among the ſervants, who now all affirmed, that they had frequently heard unaccountable noiſes in the chateau, that a report ſoon reached the Count of the north ſide of the caſtle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing haunted. He treated this, at firſt, with ridicule, but, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, that it was productive of ſerious evil, in the confuſion it occaſioned among his houſehold, he forbade any perſon to repeat it, on pain of puniſhment.</p>
                     <p>The arrival of a party of his friends ſoon withdrew his thoughts entirely from this ſubject, and his ſervants had now

                        </gap> leiſure to brood over it, except, indeed, in the evenings after ſupper, when they all aſſembled in their hall, and related ſtories of ghoſts, till they feared to look round the room; ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if the echo of a cloſing door murmured along the paſſage, and refuſed to go ſingly to any part of the caſtle.</p>
                     <p>On theſe occaſions Annette made a diſtinguiſhed figure. When ſhe told not only of all the wonders ſhe had witneſſed, but of all that ſhe had imagined, in the caſtle of Udolpho, with the ſtory of the ſtrange diſappearance of Signora Laurentini, ſhe made no trifling impreſſion on the mind of her attentive audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. Her ſuſpicions, concerning Montoni, ſhe would alſo have freely diſcloſed, had not Ludovico, who was now in the ſervice of the Count, prudently checked her loquacity, whenever it pointed to that ſubject.</p>
                     <p>Among the viſitors at the chateau was the Baron de Saint Foix, an old friend of the Count, and his ſon, the Chevalier St. Foix, a ſenſible and amiable young man, who, having in the preceding year ſeen the Lady Blanche, at Paris, had become her declared admirer. The friendſhip, which the Count had long entertained for his father, and the equality of their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances made him ſecretly approve of the connection; but, thinking his daughter at this time too young to fix her choice for life, and wiſhing to prove the ſincerity and ſtrength of the Chevalier's attachment, he then rejected his ſuit, though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out forbidding his future hope. This young man now came, with the Baron, his father, to claim the reward of a ſteady af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, a claim, which the Count admitted and which Blanche did not reject.</p>
                     <p>While theſe viſitors were at the chateau, it became a ſcene of gaiety and ſplendour. The pavilion in the woods was fitted up and frequented, in the fine evenings, as a ſupper room, when the hour uſually concluded with a concert, at which the Count and Counteſs, who were ſcientific performers, and the Chevaliers Henri and St. Foix, with the Lady Blanche and Emily, whoſe voices and fine taſte compenſated for the want of more ſkilful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, uſually aſſiſted. Several of the Count's ſervants per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed on horns and other inſtruments, ſome of which, placed at a little diſtance among the woods, ſpoke, in ſweet reſponſe, to the harmony, that proceeded from the pavilion.</p>
                     <p>At any other period, theſe parties would have been delightful to Emily; but her ſpirits were now oppreſſed with a melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which ſhe perceived that no kind of what is called amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had power to diſſipate, and which the tender, and, frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:029378_0277_0FE0880CF42B29E0"/>
pathetic, melody of theſe concerts ſometimes increaſed to a very painful degree.</p>
                     <p>She was particularly fond of walking in the woods, that hung on a promontory, overlooking the ſea. Their luxuriant ſhade was ſoothing to her penſive mind, and, in the partial views, which they afforded of the Mediterranean, with its winding ſhores and paſſing ſails, tranquil beauty was united with gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur. The paths were rude and frequently overgrown with veg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etation, but their taſteful owner would ſuffer little to be done to them, and ſcarcely a ſingle branch to be lopped from the venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble trees. On an eminence, in one of the moſt ſequeſtered parts of theſe woods, was a ruſtic ſeat, formed of the trunk of a decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed oak, which had once been a noble tree, and of which, many lofty branches ſtill flouriſhing united with beech and pines, to overcanopy the ſpot. Beneath their deep umbrage, the eye paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over the tops of other woods, to the Mediterranean, and to the left, through an opening, was ſeen a ruined watch tower, ſtanding on a point of rock, near the ſea, and riſing from among the tufted foliage.</p>
                     <p>Hither Emily often came alone in the ſilence of evening, and, ſoothed by the ſcenery and by the faint murmur, that roſe from the waves, would ſit, till darkneſs obliged her to return to the chateau. Frequently, alſo, ſhe viſited the watch tower, which commanded the entire proſpect, and, when ſhe leaned againſt its broken walls, and thought of Valancourt, ſhe not once imagined, what was ſo true, that this tower had been almoſt as frequently his reſort, as her own, ſince his eſtrangement from the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring chateau.</p>
                     <p>One evening, ſhe lingered here to a late hour. She had ſat on the ſteps of the building, watching, in tranquil melancholy, the gradual <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The moon was now riſing out of the ſea. She watched its gradual progreſs, the extending line of radiance it threw upon the waters, the ſparkling oars, the ſail faintly ſilvered, and the wood tops and the battlements of the watch tower, at whoſe foot ſhe was ſitting, juſt tinted with the rays. Emily's ſpirits were in harmony with this ſcene. As ſhe ſat meditating, ſounds ſtole by her on the air, which ſhe immediately knew to be the muſic and the voice ſhe had formerly heard at midnight, and the emotion of awe, which ſhe felt, was not unmixed with terror, when ſhe conſidered her remote and lonely ſituation. The ſounds drew nearer. She would have riſen to leave the place, but they ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to come from the way ſhe muſt have taken towards the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau, and ſhe awaited the event in trembling expectation. The ſounds continued to approach, for ſometime, and then ceaſed. Emily ſat liſtening, gazing and unable to move, when ſhe ſaw a figure emerge from the ſhade of the woods and paſs along the bank, at ſome little diſtance before her. It went ſwiftly, and her ſpirits were ſo overcome with awe, that, though ſhe ſaw, ſhe did not much obſerve it.</p>
                     <p>Having left the ſpot, with a reſolution never again to viſit it alone, at ſo late an hour, ſhe began to approach the chateau, when ſhe heard voices calling her from the part of the wood, which was neareſt to it. They were the ſhouts of the Count's ſervants, who were ſent to ſearch for her; and, when ſhe enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſupper room, where he ſat with Henri and Blanche, he gently reproached her with a look, which ſhe bluſhed to have deſerved.</p>
                     <p>This little occurrence deeply impreſſed her mind, and, when ſhe withdrew to her own room, it recalled ſo forcibly the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances ſhe had witneſſed, a few nights before, that ſhe had ſcarcely courage to remain alone. She watched to a late hour, when, no ſound having renewed her fears, ſhe at length ſunk to repoſe. But this was of ſhort continuance, for ſhe was diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a loud and unuſual noiſe, that ſeemed to come from the gallery into which her chamber opened. Groans were diſtinctly heard, and immediately after, a dead weight fell againſt her door, with a violence, that threatened to burſt it open. She called loudly to know who was there, but received no anſwer, though at intervals, ſhe ſtill thought ſhe heard ſomething like a low moaning. Fear deprived her of the power to move. Soon after, ſhe heard footſteps in a remote part of the gallery, and as they approached, ſhe called more loudly than before, till the ſteps pauſed at her door. She then diſtinguiſhed the voices of
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:029378_0279_0FE086B4F6B77628"/>
ſeveral of the ſervants, who ſeemed too much engaged by ſome circumſtance without, to attend to her calls; but, Annette ſoon after entering the room for water, Emily underſtood, that one of the maids had fainted, whom ſhe immediately deſired them to bring into her room, where ſhe aſſiſted to reſtore her. When this girl had recovered her ſpeech, ſhe affirmed, that, as ſhe was paſſing up the back ſtaircaſe, in the way to her chamber, ſhe had ſeen an apparition on the ſecond landing place; ſhe held the lamp low, ſhe ſaid, that ſhe might pick her way, ſeveral of the ſtairs being infirm and even decayed, and it was upon raiſing her eyes, that ſhe ſaw this appearance. It ſtood for a moment in the corner of the landing place, which ſhe was approaching, and then gliding up the ſtairs, vaniſhed at the door of the apartment, that had been lately opened. She heard afterwards a hollow ſound.</p>
                     <p>"Then the devil has got a key to that apartment," ſaid Doro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thee, "for it could be nobody but he; I locked the door myſelf!"</p>
                     <p>The girl, ſpringing down the ſtairs and paſſing up the great ſtaircaſe, had run with a faint ſcream, till ſhe reached the gallery, where ſhe fell, groaning, at Emily's door.</p>
                     <p>Gently chiding her for the alarm ſhe had occaſioned, Emily tried to make her aſhamed of her fears; but the girl perſiſted i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

that Ludovico proved at once his courage and his gratitude for the kindneſs he had received from the Count, by offering to watch, during a night, in the ſuite of rooms, reputed to be haunted. He feared, he ſaid, no ſpirits, and, if any thing of human form appeared—he would prove that he dreaded that as little.</p>
                     <p>The Count pauſed upon the offer, while the ſervants who heard it looked upon one another in doubt and amazement, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette, terrified for the ſafety of Ludovico, employed tears and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties to diſſuade him from his purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>"You are a bold fellow," ſaid the Count, ſmiling, "Think well of what you are going to encounter, before you finally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine upon it. However, if you perſevere in your reſolution, I will accept your offer, and your intrepidity ſhall not go unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded."</p>
                     <p>"I deſire no reward, your <hi>Excellenza,"</hi> replied Ludovico, "but your approbation. Your <hi>Excellenza</hi> has been ſufficiently good to me already; but I wiſh to have arms, that I may be equal to my enemy, if he ſhould appear."</p>
                     <p>"Your ſword cannot defend you againſt a ghoſt," replied the Count, throwing a glance of irony upon the other ſervants, "neither can bars, or bolts; for a ſpirit you know, can glide through a key hole, as eaſily as through a door."</p>
                     <p>"Give me a ſword, my lord Count," ſaid Ludovico, "and I will lay all the ſpirits, that ſhall attack me, in the red ſea."</p>
                     <p>"Well," ſaid the Count, "you ſhall have a ſword and good cheer, too; and your brave comrades here will, perhaps, have courage enough to remain another night in the chateau, ſince your boldneſs will certainly, for this night, at leaſt, confine all the malice of the ſpectre to yourſelf."</p>
                     <p>Curioſity now ſtruggled with fear in the minds of ſeveral of his fellow ſervants, and, at length, they reſolved to await the event of Ludovico's raſhneſs.</p>

                     <p>THE Count gave orders for the north apartments to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened and prepared for the reception of Ludovico; but Dorothee, remembering what ſhe had lately witneſſed there, feared to obey, and, not one of the other ſervants daring to venture thither, the rooms remained ſhut up till the time when Ludovico was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire thither for the night, an hour, for which the whole houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold waited with impatience.</p>
                     <p>After ſupper, Ludovico by the order of the Count, attended him in his cloſet, where they remained alone for near half an hour, and, on leaving which, his lord delivered to him a ſword.</p>
                     <p>"It has ſeen ſervice in mortal quarrels," ſaid the Count, jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſely, "you will uſe it honourably, no doubt, in a ſpiritual one. To morrow, let me hear that there is not one ghoſt remaining in the chateau."</p>
                     <p>Ludovico received it with a reſpectful bow. "You ſhall be obeyed, my Lord," ſaid he, "I will engage, that no ſpectre ſhall diſturb the peace of the chateau after this night."</p>
                     <p>They now returned to the ſupper room, where the Count gueſts awaited to accompany him and Ludovico to the door <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Having reached the back ſtaircaſe, ſeveral of the ſervants ſhrunk back, and refuſed to go further, but the reſt followed him to the top of the ſtaircaſe, where a broad landing place allowed them to flock round him, while he applied the key to the door, during which they watched him with as much eager curioſity as if he had been performing ſome magical rite.</p>
                     <p>Ludovico, unaccuſtomed to the lock, could not turn it, and Dorothee, who had lingered far behind, was called forward, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

whoſe hand the door opened ſlowly, and her eye glancing within the duſky chamber, ſhe uttered a ſudden ſhriek, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated. At this ſignal of alarm, the greater part of the crowd hurried down the ſtairs, and the Count, Henri and Ludovico were left alone to purſue the inquiry, who inſtantly ruſhed into the apartment, Ludovico with a drawn ſword, which he had juſt time to draw from the ſcabbard, the Count with the lamp in his hand, and Henri carrying a baſket, containing proviſion for the courageous adventurer.</p>
                     <p>Having looked haſtily round the firſt room, where nothing appeared to juſtify alarm, they paſſed on to the ſecond; and here too all being quiet, they proceeded to a third in a more tempered ſtep. The Count had now leiſure to ſmile at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſure, into which he had been ſurpriſed, and to aſk Ludov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ico in which room he deſigned to paſs the night.</p>
                     <p>"There are ſeveral chambers beyond theſe, your <hi>Excellenza,"</hi> ſaid Ludovico, pointing to a door, "and in one of them is a bed, they ſay. I will paſs the night there, and when I am weary of watching, I can lie down."</p>
                     <p>"Good;" ſaid the Count, "let us go on. You ſee theſe rooms ſhew nothing, but damp walls and decaying furniture. I have been ſo much engaged ſince I came to the chateau, that I have not looked into them till now. Remember, Ludovico, to tell the houſekeeper, to morrow to throw open theſe windows. The damaſk hangings are dropping to pieces, I will have them taken down, and this antique furniture removed."</p>
                     <p>"Dear ſir!" ſaid Henri, "here is an arm chair ſo maſſy with gilding, that it reſembles one of the ſtate chairs at the Louvre, more than any thing elſe."</p>
                     <p>"Yes," ſaid the Count, ſtopping a moment to ſurvey it, "There is a hiſtory belonging to that chair, but I have not time to tell it.—Let us paſs on. This ſuite runs to a greater extent than I had imagined; It is many years ſince I was in them. But where is the bed room you ſpeak of, Ludovico?—theſe are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anti chambers to the great drawing room. I remember them in their ſplendour!"</p>
                     <p>"The bed, my Lord," replied Ludovico, "they told me, was in a room that opens beyond the ſaloon, and terminates the ſuite."</p>
                     <p>"O, here is the ſaloon," ſaid the Count, as they entered the ſpacious apartment, in which Emily and Dorothee had reſted. He here ſtood for a moment, ſurveying the reliques of faded gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, which it exhibited—the ſumptuous tapeſtry—the long and low ſophas of velvet, with frames heavily carved and gilded—the
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:029378_0281_0FE086C7F0F3C0E8"/>
floor inlaid with ſmall ſquares of fine marble, and covered in the centre with a piece of very rich tapeſtry work—the caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of painted glaſs, and the large Venetian mirrors of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Theſe had formerly alſo reflected a gay and brilliant ſcene, for this had been the ſtate room of the chateau, and here the Marchioneſs had held the aſſemblies, that made part of the feſtivities of her nuptials. If the wand of a magician could have recalled the vaniſhed groups, many of them vaniſhed even from the the earth! that once had paſſed over theſe poliſhed mirrors, what a varied and contraſted picture would they have exhibited with the preſent! Now, inſtead of a blaze of lights, and a ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and buſy crowd, they reflected only the rays of the one glimmering lamp, which the Count held up, and which ſcarcely ſerved to ſhew the three forlorn figures, that ſtood ſurveying the room, and the ſpacious and duſky walls around them.</p>
                     <p>"Ah!" ſaid the Count to Henri, awaking from his deep re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie, "how the ſcene is changed ſince laſt I ſaw it! I was a young man, then, and the Marchioneſs was alive and in her bloom; many other perſons were here, too, who are now no more! There ſtood the orcheſtry; here we tripped in many a ſprightly maze—the walls echoing to the dance! Now they reſound only one feeble voice—and even that will, ere long be heard no more! My ſon, remember, that I was once as young as yourſelf, and that you muſt paſs away like thoſe, who have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded you—like thoſe, who, as they ſung and danced in this once gay apartment, forgot that years are made up of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and that every ſtep they took carried them nearer to their graves. But ſuch reflections are uſeleſs, I had almoſt ſaid crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inal, unleſs they teach us to prepare for eternity, ſince, otherwiſe they cloud our preſent happineſs, without guiding us to a future one. But enough of this; let us go on."</p>
                     <p>Ludovico now opened the door of the bed room, and the Count, as he entered, was ſtruck with the funeral appearance, which the dark arras gave to it. He approached the bed, with an emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſolemnity, and, perceiving it to be covered with the pall of black velvet, pauſed; "what can this mean?" ſaid he, as he gazed upon it.</p>
                     <p>"I have heard, my Lord," ſaid Ludovico, as he ſtood at the feet, looking within the canopied curtains, "that the Lady Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs de Villeroi died in this chamber, and remained here till ſhe was removed to be buried; and this, perhaps, Signor, may account for the pall."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="109" facs="unknown:029378_0281_0FE086C7F0F3C0E8"/>
The Count made no reply, but ſtood for a few moments en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in thought, and evidently much affected. They turning to Ludovico, he aſked him with a ſerious air, whether he thought his courage would ſupport him through the night? "If you doubt this," added the Count, "do not be aſhamed to own it; I will releaſe you from your engagement, without expoſing you to the triumphs of your fellow ſervants."</p>
                     <p>Ludovico pauſed; pride, and ſomething very like fear, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtruggling in his breaſt; pride, however, was victorious; he bluſhed, and his heſitation ceaſed.</p>
                     <p>"No, my Lord," ſaid he, "I will go through with what I have begun; and I am grateful for your conſideration. On that hearth I will make a fire, and, with the good cheer in this baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, I doubt not I ſhall do well."</p>
                     <p>"Be it ſo," ſaid the Count; "but how will you beguile the tediouſneſs of the night, if you do not ſleep?</p>
                     <p>"When I am weary, my Lord," replied Ludovico, "I ſhall not fear to ſleep; in the meanwhile I have a book, that will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain me."</p>
                     <p>"Well," ſaid the Count, "I hope nothing will diſturb you; but if you ſhould be ſeriouſly alarmed in the night, come to my apartment. I have too much confidence in your good ſenſe and courage, to believe you will be alarmed on ſlight grounds; or ſuffer the gloom of this chamber, or its remote ſituation, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come you with ideal terrors. To morrow, I ſhall have to thank you for an important ſervice; theſe rooms ſhall then be thrown open, and my people will be convinced of their error. Good night, Ludovico; let me ſee you early in the morning, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what I lately ſaid to you."</p>

                     <p>He lighted the Count and Henri through the chambers to the outer door; on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Then, as he retired to the bed chamber, he examined the rooms, through which he paſſed, with more minuteneſs than he had done before, for he apprehended, that ſome perſon might have concealed himſelf in them, for the purpoſe of frightening him. No one, however, but himſelf, was in theſe chambers, and, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open the doors, through which he paſſed, he came again to
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:029378_0282_0FE086D56F49D5C0"/>
the great drawing room, whoſe ſpaciouſneſs and ſilent gloom ſomewhat awed him. For a moment he ſtood, looking back through the long ſuite of rooms he had quitted, and, as he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, perceiving a light and his own figure, reflected in one of the large mirrors, he ſtarted. Other objects too were ſeen obſcurely on its dark ſurface, but he pauſed not to examine them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned haſtily into the bed room, as he ſurveyed which, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the door of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and opened it. All within was ſtill. On looking round, his eye was arreſted by the portrait of the deceaſed Marchioneſs, upon which he gazed, for a conſiderable time, with great attention and ſome ſurpriſe; and then, having examined the cloſet, he returned into the bed room, where he kindled a wood fire, the bright blaze of which revived his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which had began to yield to the gloom and ſilence of the place, for guſts of wind alone broke at intervals this ſilence. He now drew a ſmall table and a chair near the fire, took a bottle of wine, and ſome cold proviſion out of his baſket, and regaled himſelf. When he had finiſhed his repaſt, he ſaid his ſword up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the table, and, not feeling diſpoſed to ſleep, drew from his pocket the book he had ſpoken of. It was a volume of old Provencal tales. Having ſtirred the fire into a brighter blaze, trimmed his lamp, and drawn his chair upon the hearth, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to read, and his attention was ſoon wholly occupied by the ſcenes, which the page diſcloſed.</p>
                     <p>The Count, meanwhile, had returned to the ſupper room, whither thoſe of the party, who had attended him to the north apartment, had retreated, upon hearing Dorothee's ſcream, and who were now earneſt in their inquiries concerning thoſe cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. The Count rallied his gueſts on their precipitate retreat, and on the ſuperſtitious inclination which had occaſioned it, and this led to the queſtion, Whether the ſpirit, after it has quitted the body, is ever permitted to reviſit the earth; and if it is, whether it was poſſible for ſpirits to become viſible to the ſenſe. The Baron was of opinion, that the firſt was probable, and the laſt was poſſible, and he endeavoured to juſtify this opinion by reſpectable authorities, both moment and modern, which he quot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Count, however, was decidedly againſt him, and a long converſation enſued, in which the uſual arguments on theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects were on both ſides brought forward with ſkill, and diſcuſſed with candour, but without converting either party to the opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of his opponent. The effect of their converſation on their auditors was various. Though the Count had much the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority of the Bavon in point of argument, he had conſiderably
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:029378_0282_0FE086D56F49D5C0"/>
fewer adherents; for that love, ſo natural to the human mind, of whatever is able to diſtend its faculties with wonder and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, attached the majority of the company to the ſide of the Baron; and, though many of the Count's propoſitions were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable, his opponents were inclined to believe this the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of their own want of knowledge, on ſo abſtracted a ſubject, rather than that arguments did not exiſt, which were forcible enough to conquer his.</p>
                     <p>Blanche was pale with attention, till the ridicule in her father's glance called a bluſh upon her countenance, and ſhe then endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to forget the ſuperſtitious tales ſhe had been told in her convent. Meanwhile, Emily had been liſtening with deep at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the diſcuſſion of what was to her a very intereſting queſtion, and, remembering the appearance ſhe had witneſſed in the apartment of the late Marchioneſs, ſhe was frequently chill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with awe. Several times ſhe was on the point of mentioning what ſhe had ſeen, but the fear of giving pain to the Count, and the dread of his ridicule, reſtrained her; and, awaiting in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious expectation the event of Ludovico's intrepidity, ſhe deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined that her future ſilence ſhould depend upon it.</p>
                     <p>When the party had ſeparated for the night, and the Count retired to his dreſſing room, the remembrance of the deſolate ſcenes he had lately witneſſed in his own manſion deeply affected him, but at length he was arouſed from his reverie and his ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. "What muſic is that I hear?" ſaid he ſuddenly to his valet, "Who plays at this late hour?"</p>
                     <p>The man made no reply, and the Count continued to liſten, and then added, "That is no common muſician; be touches the inſtrument with a delicate hand; who is it Pierre?"</p>
                     <p>"My Lord!" ſaid the man, heſitatingly.</p>
                     <p>"Who plays that inſtrument?" repeated the Count.</p>
                     <p>"Does not your lordſhip know, then!" ſaid the valet.</p>
                     <p>"What mean you?" ſaid the Count, ſomewhat ſternly.</p>
                     <p>"Nothing, my Lord, I meant nothing," rejoined the man ſubmiſſively—"Only—that muſic—goes about the houſe at midnight often, and I thought your lordſhip might have heard it before."</p>
                     <p>"Muſic goes about the houſe at midnight! Poor fellow!—does nobody dance to the muſic, too?"</p>
                     <p>"It is not in the chateau, I believe, my Lord; the ſounds come from the woods, they ſay, though they ſeem ſo near; but then a ſpirit can do any thing!"</p>
                     <p>"Ah, poor follow!" ſaid the Count, "I perceive you are as

It had been lent to him by Dorothee, who had formerly picked it up in an obſcure corner of the Marquis's li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary, and who having opened it and perceived ſome of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels it related, had carefully preſerved it for her own entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, its condition giving her ſome excuſe for detaining it from its proper ſtation.

Some of the tales, however, in the book now before Ludovico, were of ſimple ſtructure, and exhibited nothing of the magnificent machinery and heroic manners, which uſually charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſed the fables of the twelfth century, and of this deſcription was the one he now happened to open, which, in its original ſtyle, was of great length, but which may be thus ſhortly related.

Believing, that this perſon had been ſecreted in the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſince it appeared impoſſible he could have lately paſſed the anti room, unobſerved by the pages in waiting, who would have prevented this intruſion on their lord, the Baron, calling loudly for his people, drew his ſword, which he had not yet taken from his ſide, and ſtood upon his defence. The ſtranger ſlowly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing, told him, that there was nothing to fear; that he came with no hoſtile deſign, but to communicate to him a terrible ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, which it was neceſſary for him to know.</p>
                                 <p>"The Baron, appeaſed by the courteous manners of the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, after ſurveying him, for ſometime, in ſilence, returned his ſword into the ſcabbard, and deſired him to explain the means, by which he had obtained acceſs to the chamber, and the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of this extraordinary viſit.</p>
                                 <p>"Without anſwering either of theſe inquiries, the ſtranger ſaid, that he could not then explain himſelf, but that, if the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron would follow him to the edge of the foreſt, at a ſhort diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the caſtle walls, he would there convince him, that he had ſomething of importance to diſcloſe.</p>
                                 <p>"This propoſal again alarmed the Baron, who could ſcarcely believe, that the ſtranger meant to draw him to ſo ſolitary a ſpot, at this hour of the night, without harbouring a deſign againſt his life, and he refuſed to go, obſerving, at the ſame time, that, if the ſtranger's purpoſe was an honourable one, he would not perſiſt in refuſing to reveal the occaſion of his viſit, in the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment where they were.</p>
                                 <p>"While he ſpoke this, he viewed the ſtranger ſtill more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively than before, but obſerved no change in his countenance, or any ſymptom, that might intimate a conſciouſneſs of evil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. He was habited like a knight, was of a tall and majeſtic ſtature, and of dignified and courteous manners. Still, howev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he refuſed to communicate the ſubject of his errand in any place, but that he had mentioned, and, at the ſame time, gave hints concerning the ſecret he would diſcloſe, that awakened a degree of ſolemn curioſity in the Baron, which at length induced him to conſent to follow the ſtranger, on certain conditions.</p>
                                 <p>"Sir knight," ſaid he, "I will attend you to the foreſt, and will take with me only four of my people, who ſhall witneſs our conference."</p>

Tell me, at leaſt, who you are, and who aſſiſted to ſecret you in this chamber."</p>
                                 <p>"The knight frowned at theſe latter words, and was a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſilent; then, with a countenance ſomewhat ſtern, he ſaid,</p>

"After ſome further heſitation, the Baron determined to follow the ſtranger, and to ſee the reſult of his extraordinary requeſt; he, therefore, again drew forth his ſword, and, taking up a lamp, bade the Knight lead on. The latter obeyed, and opening the door of the chamber they paſſed into the anti room, where the Baron, ſurpriſed to find all his pages aſleep, ſtopped, and, with haſty vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, was going to reprimand them for their careleſſneſs, when the Knight waved his hand, and looked ſo expreſſively upon the Baron, that the latter reſtrained his reſentment, and paſſed on.</p>
                                 <p>"The Knight, having deſcended a ſtaircaſe, opened a ſecret door, which the Baron had believed was known only to himſelf, and, proceeding through ſeveral narrow and winding paſſages, came, at length, to a ſmall gate, that opened beyond the walls of the caſtle. Meanwhile, the Baron followed in ſilence and amazement, on perceiving that theſe ſecret paſſages were ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Then conſidering that he was armed, and obſerving the courteous and noble air of his conductor, his courage returned, he bluſhed, that it had failed him for a moment, and he reſolved to trace the myſtery to its ſource. "He now found himſelf on the heathy platform, before his caſtle, where, looking up, he perceived lights glimmering in the different caſements of the gueſts, who were retiring to ſleep; and while he ſhivered in the blaſt, and looked on the dark and deſolate ſcene around him, he thought of the comforts of his warm chamber, rendered cheerful by the bla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                                 <p>[Here Ludovico pauſed a moment, and looking at his own fire, gave it a brightening ſtir.]</p>
                                 <p>"The wind was ſtrong, and the Baron watched his lamp with anxiety, expecting every moment to ſee it extinguiſhed; but, though the flame wavered, it did not expire, and he ſtill followed the ſtranger, who often ſighed as he went, but did not ſpeak.</p>
                                 <p>"When they reached the borders of the foreſt, the Knight turned, and raiſed his head, as if he meant to addreſs the Baron, but then, cloſing his lips in ſilence, he walked on.</p>
                                 <p>"As they entered, beneath the dark and ſpreading boughs, the Baron, affected by the ſolemnity of the ſcene, heſitated whether to proceed, and demanded how much further they were to go. The Knight replied only by a geſture, and the Baron, with heſitating ſteps and a ſuſpicious eye, followed through an
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:029378_0285_0FE086EC29D5A3F8"/>
obſcure and intricate path, till, having proceeded a conſiderable way, he again demanded whither they were going, and refuſed to proceed unleſs he was informed.</p>
                                 <p>"As he ſaid this, he looked at his own ſword, and at the Knight alternately, who ſhook his head, and whoſe dejected countenance diſarmed the Baron, for a moment, of ſuſpicion.</p>
                                 <p>"A little further is the place, whither I would lead you," ſaid the ſtranger; "no evil ſhall befall you—I have ſworn it on the honour of a Knight."</p>
                                 <p>"The Baron, reaſſured, again followed in ſilence, and they ſoon arrived at a deep receſs of the foreſt, where the dark and lofty cheſnuts entirely excluded the ſky, and which was ſo overgrown with underwood, that they proceeded with difficulty. The Knight ſighed deeply as he paſſed, and ſometimes pauſed; and having, at length, reached a ſpot, where the trees crowded into a knot, he turned and, with a terrific look, pointing to the ground, the Baron ſaw there the body of a man, ſtretched at its length, and weltering in blood; a ghaſtly wound was on the forehead, and death appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed already to have contracted the features.</p>
                                 <p>"The Baron, on perceiving the ſpectacle, ſtarted in horror, looked at the Knight for explanation, and was then going to raiſe the body and examine if there were yet any remains of life; but the ſtranger, waving his hand, fixed upon him a look ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and mournful, as not only much ſurpriſed him, but made him deſiſt.</p>
                                 <p>"But, what were the Baron's emotions, when, on holding the lamp near the features of the corpſe, he diſcovered the exact reſemblance of the ſtranger his conductor, to whom he now look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in aſtoniſhment and inquiry? As he gazed, he perceived the countenance of the Knight change, and begin to fade, till his whole form gradually vaniſhed from his aſtoniſhed ſenſe!

It was a gray autumnal morning. The ſun, riſing over Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence, gave only a feeble light, as his rays ſtruggled through the vapours that aſcended from the ſea, and floated heavily over the wood tops, which were now varied with many a mellow tint of autumn. The ſtorm was paſſed, but the waves were yet vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently agitated, and their courſe was traced by long lines of foam, while not a breeze fluttered in the ſails of the veſſels, near the ſhore, that were weighing anchor to depart. The ſtill gloom of the hour was pleaſing to the Count, and he purſued his way through the woods, ſunk in deep thought.</p>
                     <p>Emily alſo roſe at an early hour, and took her cuſtomary walk along the brow of the promontory, that overhung the Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean. Her mind was now not occupied with the occurrences of the chateau, and Valancourt was the ſubject of her mournful thoughts; whom ſhe had not yet taught herſelf to conſider with indifference, though her judgment conſtantly reproached her for the affection, that lingered in her heart, after her eſteem for him was departed. Remembrance frequently gave her his parting look and the tones of his voice, when he had bade her a laſt fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel; and, ſome accidental aſſociations now recalling theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances to her fancy, with peculiar energy, ſhe ſhed bitter tears to the recollection.</p>
                     <p>Having reached the watch tower, ſhe ſeated herſelf on the broken ſteps, and, in melancholy dejection, watched the waves, half hid in vapour, as they came rolling towards the ſhore, and threw up their light ſpray round the rocks below. Their hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low murmur and the obſcuring miſts, that came in wreaths up the cliffs, gave a ſolemnity to the ſcene, which was in harmony with the temper of her mind, and ſhe ſat, given up to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of paſt times, till this became too painful, and ſhe abruptly quitted the place. On paſſing the little gate of the watch tower, ſhe obſerved letters, engraved on the ſtone poſtern, which ſhe pauſed to examine, and, though they appeared to have been rudely cut with a penknife, the characters were familiar to her; at length, recognizing the hand writing of Valancourt, ſhe read, with trembling anxiety, the following lines, entitled</p>

It was thus even probable, that he might be yet in the gardens.</p>
                     <p>As theſe reflections paſſed rapidly over the mind of Emily, they called up a variety of contending emotions, that almoſt overcame her ſpirits; but her firſt impulſe was to avoid him, and, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately leaving the tower, ſhe returned, with haſty ſteps, towards the chateau. As ſhe paſſed along, ſhe remembered the muſic ſhe had lately heard near the tower, with the figure, which had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and, in this moment of agitation, ſhe was inclined to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that ſhe had then heard and ſeen Valancourt; but other recollections ſoon convinced her of her error. On turning into a thicker part of the woods, ſhe perceived a perſon walking ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the gloom at ſome little diſtance, and, her mind engaged by the idea of him, ſhe ſtarted and pauſed, imagining this to be Valancourt. The perſon advanced with quicker ſteps, and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe could recover recollection enough to avoid him, he ſpoke, and ſhe then knew the voice of the Count, who expreſſed ſome ſurpriſe, on finding her walking at ſo early an hour, and made a feeble effort to rally her on her love of ſolitude. But he ſoon perceived this to be more a ſubject of concern than of light laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and, changing his manner, affectionately expoſtulated with Emily, on thus indulging unavailing regret; who, though ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the juſtneſs of all he ſaid, could not reſtrain her tears, while ſhe did ſo, and he preſently quitted the topic. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing ſurpriſe at not having yet heard from his friend, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate at Avignon, in anſwer to the queſtions propoſed to him, reſpecting the eſtates of the late Madame Montoni, he, with friendly zeal, endeavoured to cheer Emily with hopes of eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing her claim to them; while ſhe felt, that the eſtates could now contribute little to the happineſs of a life, in which Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court had no longer an intereſt.</p>

When they returned to the chateau. Emily retired to her apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Count de Villefort to the door of the north chambers. This was ſtill faſtened, but, being now determined to arouſe Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovico, he renewed his calls more loudly than before, after which a total ſilence enſued, and the Count, finding all his efforts to be heard ineffectual, at length began to fear, that ſome accident had befallen Ludovico, whom terror of an imaginary being might have deprived of his ſenſes. He, therefore, left the door with an intention of ſummoning his ſervants to force it open, ſome of whom he now heard moving in the lower part of the chateau.</p>
                     <p>To the Count's inquiries, whether they had ſeen or heard Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovico, they replied in affright, that not one of them had ventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the north ſide of the chateau, ſince the preceding night.</p>
                     <p>"He ſleeps ſoundly then," ſaid the Count, "and is at ſuch a diſtance from the outer door, which is faſtened, that to gain admittance to the chambers it will be neceſſary to force it. Bring an inſtrument, and follow me."</p>
                     <p>The ſervants ſtood mute and dejected, and it was not till <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> room of the ſaloon, and this being much nearer to the bed chamber, it appeared probable, that Ludovico might eaſily be awakened by an attempt to open it. Thither, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Count went, but his voice was as ineffectual at this door as it had proved at the remoter one; and now, ſeriouſly intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Ludovico, he was himſelf going to ſtrike upon the door with the inſtrument, when he obſerved its ſingular beauty, and withheld the blow. It appeared, on the firſt glance, to be of ebony, ſo dark and cloſe was its grain and ſo high its poliſh; but it proved to be only of larch wood of the growth of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence, then famous for its foreſts of larch. The beauty of its poliſhed hue, and of its delicate carvings determined the Count to ſpare this door, and he returned to that leading from the back ſtaircaſe, which being at length forced, he entered the firſt anti room, followed by Henri and a few of the moſt courageous of his ſervants, the reſt awaiting the event of the inquiry on the ſtairs and landing place.</p>
                     <p>All was ſilent in the chambers, through which the Count paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and, having reached the ſaloon, he called loudly upon Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovico; after which, ſtill receiving no anſwer, he threw open the door of the bed room, and entered.</p>
                     <p>

The profound ſtillneſs within confirmed his apprehenſions for Ludovico, for not even the breathings of a perſon in ſleep were heard; and his uncertainty was not ſoon terminated, ſince, the ſhutters being all cloſed, the chamber was too dark for any object to be diſtinguiſhed in it.</p>
                     <p>The Count bade a ſervant open them, who, as he croſſed the room to do ſo, ſtumbled over ſomething, and fell to the floor, when his cry occaſioned ſuch panic among the few of his fellows, who had ventured thus far, that they inſtantly fled, and the Count and Henri were left to finiſh the adventure.</p>
                     <p>Henri then ſprung acroſs the room, and opening a window ſhutter, they perceived, that the man had fallen over a chair near the hearth, in which Ludovico had been ſitting;—for he ſat there no longer, nor could any where be ſeen by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect light that was admitted into the apartment. The Count, ſeriouſly alarmed, now opened other ſhutters, that he might be enabled to examine further, and, Ludovico not yet appearing, he ſtood for a moment, ſuſpended in aſtoniſhment and ſcarcely truſting his ſenſes, till, his eyes glancing on the bed, he advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to examine whether he was there aſleep. No perſon, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, was in it, and he proceeded to the oriel, where every thing remained as on the preceding night, but Ludovico was no where to be found.</p>
                     <p>The Count now checked his amazement, conſidering that Ludovico might have left the chambers, during the night, overcome by the terrors, which their lonely deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and the recollected reports, concerning them, had inſpired. Yet if this had been the fact, the man would naturally have ſought ſociety, and his fellow ſervants had all declared they had not ſeen him; the door of the outer room alſo had been found faſtened, with the key on the inſide; it was impoſſible, therefore, for him to have paſſed through that, and all the outer doors of this ſuite were found, on examination, to be bolted and locked, with the keys alſo within them. The Count, being then compelled to believe, that the lad had eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the caſements, next examined them, but ſuch as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened wide enough to admit the body of a man, were found to be carefully ſecured either by iron bars, or by ſhutters, and no veſtige appeared of any perſon having attempted to paſs them; neither was it probable, that Ludovico would have incurred the riſk of breaking his neck, by leaping from a window, when he might have walked ſafely through a door.</p>
                     <p>The Count's amazement did not admit of words; but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned once more to examine the bed room, where was no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance

of diſorder, except that occaſioned by the late over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the chair rear which had ſtood a ſmall table, and on this Ludovico's ſword, his lamp, the book he had been reading, and the remnant of his flaſk of wine ſtill remained. At the foot of the table, too, was the baſket with ſome fragments of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion and wood.</p>
                     <p>Henri and the ſervant now uttered their aſtoniſhment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſerve, and, though the Count ſaid little, there was a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in his manner, that expreſſed much. It appeared that Ludovico muſt have quitted theſe rooms by ſome concealed paſſage, for the Count could not believe that any ſupernatural means had occaſioned this event, yet, if there was any ſuch paſſage, it ſeemed inexplicable why he ſhould retreat through it, and it was equally ſurpriſing, that not even the ſmalleſt veſtige ſhould appear, by which his progreſs could be traced. In the rooms every thing remained as much in order as if he had juſt walked out by the common way.</p>
                     <p>The Count himſelf aſſiſted in lifting the arras, with which the bed chamber, ſaloon and one of the anti rooms were hung, that he might diſcover if any door had been concealed behind it; but, after a laborious ſearch, none was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He then gave orders, that ſtrict ſearch ſhould be made for Ludovico not only in the chateau, but in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>On the diſappearing of Ludovico, Baron St. Foix ſeemed ſtrengthened in all his former opinions concerning the probability of apparitions, though it was difficult to diſcover what connection there could poſſibly be between the two ſubjects, or to account for this effect otherwiſe than by ſuppoſing, that the myſtery attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ludovico, by exciting awe and curioſity, reduced the mind to a ſtate of ſenſibility, which rendered it more liable to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of ſuperſtition in general. It is, however, certain, that from this period the Baron and his adherents became more big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oted to their own ſyſtems than before, while the terrors of the Count's ſervants increaſed to an exceſs that occaſioned many of them to quit the manſion immediately, and the reſt remained only till others could be procured to ſupply their places.</p>

The moſt ſtrenuous ſearch after Ludovico proved unſucceſsful, and after ſeveral days of indefatigable inquiry, poor Annette gave herſelf up to deſpair, and the other inhabitants of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau to amazement.</p>
                     <p>Emily, whoſe mind had been deeply affected by the diſaſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fate of the late Marchioneſs and with the myſterious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection, which ſhe fancied had exiſted between her and St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, was particularly impreſſed by the late extraordinary event, and much concerned for the loſs of Ludovico, whoſe integrity and faithful ſervices claimed both her eſteem and gratitude. She was now very deſirous to return to the quiet retirement of her convent, but every hint of this was received with real ſorrow by the Lady Blanche, and affectionately ſet aſide by the Count, for whom ſhe felt much of the reſpectful love and admiration of a daughter, and to whom, by Dorothee's conſent, ſhe at length, mentioned the appearance, which they had witneſſed in the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the deceaſed Marchioneſs. At any other period he would have ſmiled at ſuch a relation, and have believed that its object had exiſted only in the diſtempered fancy of the relater; but he now attended to Emily with ſeriouſneſs, and when ſhe conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, requeſted of her a promiſe, that this occurrence ſhould reſt in ſilence.</p>
                     <p>"Whatever may be the cauſe and the import of theſe extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary occurrences," added the Count, "time only can explain them. I ſhall keep a wary eye upon all that paſſes in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau, and ſhall purſue every poſſible means of diſcovering the fate of Ludovico. Meanwhile, we muſt be prudent and be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. I will myſelf watch in the north chambers, but of this we will ſay nothing, till the night arrives, when I purpoſe doing ſo."</p>
                     <p>The Count then ſent for Dorothee, and required of her alſo a promiſe of ſilence, concerning what ſhe had already or might in future witneſs of an extraordinary nature; and this ancient ſervant now related to him the particulars of the Marchioneſs de Villeroi's death, with ſome of which he appeared to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready acquainted, while by others he was evidently ſurpriſed and agitated. After liſtening to this narrative, the Count retired to his cloſet, where he remained alone for ſeveral hours; and, when he again appeared, the ſolemnity of his manner ſurpriſed and alarmed Emily, but ſhe gave no utterance to her thoughts.</p>
                     <p>On the week following the diſappearance of Ludovico, all the Count's gueſts took leave of him, except the Baron, his ſon Monſ. St. Foix, and Emily; the latter of whom was ſoon after embarraſſed and diſtreſſed by the arrival of another viſitor, Monſ.

Du Pont, which made her determine upon withdrawing to her convent immediately. The delight that appeared in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, when he met her, told that he brought back the ſame ardour of paſſion which had formerly baniſhed him from Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau-le-Blanc. He was received with reſerve by Emily, and with pleaſure by the Count, who preſented him to her with a ſmile, that ſeemed intended to plead his cauſe, and who did not hope the leſs for his friend, from the embarraſſment ſhe betrayed.</p>
                     <p>But M. Du Pont, with truer ſympathy ſeemed to underſtand her manner, and his countenance quickly loſt its vivacity and ſunk into the languor of deſpondency.</p>
                     <p>On the following day, however, he ſought an opportunity of declaring the purport of his viſit, and renewed his ſuit; a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, which was received with real concern by Emily, who endeavoured to leſſen the pain ſhe might inflict by a ſecond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, with aſſurances of eſteem and friendſhip; yet ſhe left him in a ſtate of mind, that claimed and excited her tendereſt compaſſion; and being more ſenſible than ever of the impropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of remaining longer at the chateau, ſhe immediately ſought the Count, and communicated to him her intention of returning to the convent.</p>
                     <p>"My dear Emily," ſaid he, "I obſerve, with extreme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, the illuſion you are encouraging—an illuſion common to young and ſenſible minds. Your heart has received a ſevere ſhock; you believe you can never entirely recover it, and you will encourage this belief, till the habit of indulging ſorrow will ſubdue the ſtrength of your mind, and diſcolour your future views with melancholy and regret. Let me diſſipate this illuſion, and awaken you to a ſenſe of your danger."</p>
                     <p>Emily ſmiled mournfully, "I know what you would ſay, my dear ſir," ſaid ſhe, "and am prepared to anſwer you. I feel, that my heart can never know a ſecond affection; and that I muſt never hope even to recover its tranquillity—if I ſuffer my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to enter into a ſecond engagement."</p>
                     <p>"I know, that you feel all this," replied the Count; "and I know, alſo, that time will overcome theſe feelings, unleſs you cheriſh them in ſolitude, and, pardon me, with romantic tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Then, indeed, time will only confirm habit. I am parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly empowered to ſpeak on this ſubject, and to ſympathize in your ſufferings," added the Count, with an air of ſolemnity, "for I have known what it is to love, and to lament the object of my love. Yes," continued he, while his eyes filled with tears, "I have ſuffered!—but thoſe times have paſſed away—long paſſed! and I can now look back upon them without emotion."</p>

"My dear ſir," ſaid Emily, timidly, "what mean thoſe tea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     <p>"They are weak tears, for they are uſeleſs ones," replied the Count, drying them, "I would have you ſuperior to ſuch weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Theſe, however, are only faint traces of a grief, which, if it not had been oppoſed by long continued effort, might have led me to the verge of madneſs! Judge, then, whether I have not cauſe to warn you of an indulgence, which may produce ſo terrible an effect, and which muſt certainly, if not oppoſed, overcloud the years, that otherwiſe might be happy. M. Du Pont is a ſenſible and amiable man, who has long been tenderly attached to you; his family and fortune are unexceptionable;—after what I have ſaid, it is unneceſſary to add, that I ſhould rejoice in your feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and that I think M. Du Pont would promote it. Do not weep, Emily," continued the Count, taking her hand, "there <hi>is</hi> happineſs reſerved for you."</p>
                     <p>He was ſilent a moment; and then added, in a firmer voice, "I do not wiſh that you ſhould make a violent effort to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come your feelings; all I, at preſent, aſk, is, that you will check the thoughts, that would lead you to a remembrance of the paſt; that you will ſuffer your mind to be engaged by preſent objects; that you will allow yourſelf to believe it poſſible you may yet be happy; and that you will ſometimes think with complacency of poor Du Pont, and not condemn him to the ſtate of deſpondency, from which, my dear Emily, I am endeavouring to withdraw you."</p>
                     <p>"Ah! my dear ſir," ſaid Emily, while her tears ſtill fell, "do not ſuffer the benevolence of your wiſhes to miſlead Monſ. Du Pont with an expectation that I can ever accept his hand. If I underſtand my own heart, this can never be; your inſtruction I can obey in almoſt every other particular, than that of adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a contrary belief."</p>
                     <p>"Leave me to underſtand your heart," replied the Count, with a faint ſmile. "If you pay me the compliment to be guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by my advice in other inſtances, I will pardon your incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, reſpecting your future conduct towards Monſ. Du Pont. I will not even preſs you to remain longer at the chateau than your own ſatisfaction will permit; but though I forbear to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe your preſent retirement, I ſhall urge the claims of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for your future viſits."</p>
                     <p>Tears of gratitude mingled with thoſe of tender regret, while Emily thanked the Count for the many inſtances of friendſhip ſhe had received from him; promiſed to be directed by his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice upon every ſubject but one, and aſſured him of the

pleaſure, with which ſhe ſhould, at ſome future period, accept the invitation of the Counteſs and himſelf—if Monſ. Du Pont was not at the chateau.</p>
                     <p>The Count ſmiled at this condition. "Be it ſo," ſaid he, "meanwhile the convent is ſo near the chateau, that my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and I ſhall often viſit you; and if, ſometimes we ſhould dare to bring you another viſitor—will you forgive us?"</p>
                     <p>Emily looked diſtreſſed, and remained ſilent.</p>
                     <p>"Well," rejoined the Count, "I will purſue this ſubject no further, and muſt now entreat your forgiveneſs for having preſſed it thus far. You will, however, do me the juſtice to believe, that I have been urged only by a ſincere regard for your happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that of my amiable friend Monſ. Du Pont."</p>
                     <p>Emily, when ſhe left the Count, went to mention her intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed departure to the Counteſs, who oppoſed it with polite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of regret; after which, ſhe ſent a note to acquaint the lady abbeſs, that ſhe ſhould return to the convent; and thither ſhe withdrew on the evening of the following day. M. Du Pont, in extreme regret, ſaw her depart, while the Count endeavoured to cheer him with a hope, that Emily would ſometimes regard him with a more favourable eye.</p>
                     <p>She was pleaſed to find herſelf once more in the tranquil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement of the convent, where ſhe experienced a renewal of all the maternal kindneſs of the abbeſs, and of the ſiſterly attentions of the nuns. A report of the late extraordinary occurrence at the chateau had already reached them, and, after ſupper, on the evening of her arrival, it was the ſubject of converſation in the convent parlour, where ſhe was requeſted to mention ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of that unaccountable event. Emily was guarded in her converſation, on this ſubject, and briefly related a few cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances concerning Ludovico, whoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"A belief had ſo long prevailed," ſaid a nun, who was called ſiſter Frances, "that the chateau was haunted, that I was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, when I heard the Count had the temerity to inhabit it. Its former poſſeſſor, I fear, had ſome deed of conſcience to atone for; let us hope that the virtues of its preſent owner will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him from the puniſhment due to the errors of the laſt, if, indeed, he was criminal."</p>
                     <p>"Of what crime, then, was he ſuſpected?" ſaid a Madem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oiſelle Feydeau, a boarder at the convent.</p>

"Let us pray for his ſoul!" ſaid a nun, who had till now ſat in ſilent attention. "If he was criminal, his puniſhment in this world was ſufficient."</p>
                     <p>There was a mixture of wildneſs and ſolemnity in her manner of delivering this, which ſtruck Emily exceedingly; but Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle repeated her queſtion, without noticing the ſolemn eagerneſs of the nun.</p>
                     <p>"I dare not preſume to ſay what was his crime," replied ſiſter Frances; "but I have heard many reports of an extraordinary nature, reſpecting the late Marquis de Villeroi, and among oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that, ſoon after the death of his lady, he quitted Chateau-le-Blanc, and never afterwards returned to it. I was not here at the time, ſo I can only mention it from report, and ſo many years have paſſed ſince the Marchioneſs died, that few of our ſiſterhood, I believe, can do more."</p>
                     <p>"But I can," ſaid the nun, who had before ſpoke, and whom they called ſiſter Agnes.</p>
                     <p>"You then," ſaid Mademoiſelle Feydeau, "are poſſibly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with circumſtances, that enable you to judge, whether he was criminal or not, and what was the crime imputed to him."</p>
                     <p>"I am," replied the nun; "but who ſhall dare to ſcrutinize my thoughts—who ſhall dare to pluck out my opinion? God only is his judge, and to that judge he is gone!"</p>
                     <p>Emily looked with ſurpriſe at ſiſter Frances, who returned her a ſignificant glance.</p>
                     <p>"I only requeſted your opinion," ſaid Mademoiſelle Feydeau, mildly; "if the ſubject is diſpleaſing to you, I will drop it."</p>
                     <p>"Diſpleaſing!"—ſaid the nun, with emphaſis.—"We are idle talkers; we do not weigh the meaning of the words we uſe; <hi>diſpleaſing</hi> is a poor word. I will go pray." As ſhe ſaid this ſhe roſe from her ſeat, and with a profound ſigh quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the room.</p>
                     <p>"What can be the meaning of this?" ſaid Emily, when ſhe was gone.</p>
                     <p>"It is nothing extraordinary," replied ſiſter Frances, "ſhe is often thus; but ſhe has no meaning in what ſhe ſays. Her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellects are at times deranged. Did you never ſee her thus before?"</p>
                     <p>"Never," ſaid Emily. "I have, indeed, ſometimes, thought, that there was the melancholy of madneſs in her look, but never before perceived it in her ſpeech. Poor ſoul I will pray for her!"</p>
                     <p>"Your prayers then, my daughter, will unite with ours," ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the lady abbeſs, "ſhe has need of them."</p>

"Dear Lady," ſaid Mademoiſelle Feydeau, addreſſing the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſs, "what is your opinion of the late Marquis?

                     <p>"We muſt be cautious of advancing our opinion," ſaid the abbeſs, with an air of reſerve, mingled with ſolemnity, "we muſt be cautious of advancing our opinion on ſo delicate a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.

ſince it appeared, that the only perſon, who could have oppoſed her claim, was now no more. A friend of M. Queſnel, who reſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Venice, had ſent him an account of the death of Montoni, who had been brought to trial with Orſino, as his ſuppoſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complice in the murder of the Venetian nobleman.

The authority, from which M. Queſnel had received this information, would not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him to doubt its truth, and he told Emily, that ſhe had now only to lay claim to the eſtates of her late aunt, to ſecure them, and added, that he would himſelf aſſiſt in the neceſſary forms of this buſineſs. The term, for which La Vallee had been let be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now alſo nearly expired, he acquainted her with the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and adviſed her to take the road thither, through Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe, where he promiſed to meet her, and where it would be proper for her to take poſſeſſion of the eſtates of the late Madame Montoni; adding, that he would ſpare her any difficulties, that might occur on that occaſion from the want of knowledge on the ſubject, and that he believed it would be neceſſary for her to be at Tholouſe, in about three weeks from the preſent time.</p>
                     <p>An increaſe of fortune ſeemed to have awakened this ſudden kindneſs in M. Queſnel towards his niece, and it appeared, that he entertained more reſpect for the rich heireſs, than he had ever felt compaſſion for the poor and unfriended orphan.</p>
                     <p>The pleaſure with which ſhe received this intelligence, was clouded when ſhe conſidered, that he, for whoſe ſake ſhe had once regretted the want of fortune, was no longer worthy of ſharing it with her; but, remembering the friendly admonition of the Count, ſhe checked this melancholy reflection, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to feel only gratitude for the unexpected good, that now attended her; while it formed no inconſiderable part of her ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfaction to know, that La Vallee, her native home, which was endeared to her by it's having been the reſidence of her parents, would ſoon be reſtored to her poſſeſſion. There ſhe meant to fix her future reſidence, for, though it could not be compared with the chateau at Tholouſe, either for extent, or magnificence, its pleaſant ſcenes and the tender remembrances, that haunted them, had claims upon her heart, which ſhe was not inclined to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:029378_0292_0FE0872D667B22A0"/>
to oſtentation. She wrote immediately to thank M. Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel for the active intereſt he took in her concerns, and to ſay, that ſhe would meet him at Tholouſe at the appointed time.</p>
                     <p>When Count de Villefort, with Blanche, came to the convent to give Emily the advice of the advocate, he was informed of the contents of M. Queſnel's letter, and gave her his ſincere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulations, on the occaſion; but ſhe obſerved, that when the firſt expreſſion of ſatisfaction had faded from his countenance, an unuſual gravity ſucceeded, and ſhe ſcarcely heſitated to inquire its cauſe.</p>
                     <p>"It has no new occaſion," replied the Count; "I am harraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and perplexed by the confuſion, into which my family is thrown by their fooliſh ſuperſtition. Idle reports are floating round me, which I can neither admit to be true, or prove to be falſe; and I am, alſo, very anxious about the poor fellow, Ludo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vico, concerning whom I have not been able to obtain informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Every part of the chateau and every part of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, too, has I believe, been ſearched, and I know not what further can be done, ſince I have already offered large rewards for the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of him. The keys of the north apartment I have not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to be out of my poſſeſſion, ſince he diſappeared, and I mean to watch in thoſe chambers, myſelf, this very night."</p>
                     <p>Emily ſeriouſly alarmed for the Count, united her entreaties with thoſe of the Lady Blanche, to diſſuade him from his purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>"What ſhould I fear?" ſaid he, "I have no faith in ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural combats, and for human oppoſition I ſhall be prepared; my, I will even promiſe not to watch alone."</p>
                     <p>"But who, dear ſir, will have courage enough to watch with you?" ſaid Emily.</p>
                     <p>"My ſon," replied the Count. "If I am not carried off in the night," added he, ſmiling, "you ſhall hear the reſult of my adventure, to morrow."</p>
                     <p>The Count and Lady Blanche, ſhortly afterwards, took leave of Emily, and returned to the chateau, where he informed Henri of his intention, who, not without ſome ſecret reluctance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to be the partner of his watch; and, when the deſign was mentioned after ſupper, the Counteſs was terrified, and the Baron, and M. Du Pont joined with her in entreating, that he would not tempt his fate, as Ludovico had done. "We know not," added the Baron, "the nature, or the power of an evil ſpirit; and that ſuch a ſpirit haunts thoſe chambers can now, I think, ſcarcely be doubted. Beware, my lord, how you provoke its vengeance, ſince it has already given us one terrible example
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:029378_0293_0FE087324756AD68"/>
of its malice. I allow it may be probable, that the ſpirits of the dead are permitted to return to the earth only on occaſions of high import; but the preſent import may be your deſtruction."</p>
                     <p>The Count could not forbear ſmiling; "Do you think then, Baron," ſaid he, "that my deſtruction is of ſufficient importance to draw back to earth the ſoul of the departed? Alas! my good friend, there is no occaſion for ſuch means to accompliſh the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of any individual. Wherever the myſtery reſts, I truſt I ſhall, this night, be able to detect it. You know I am not ſuperſtitious."</p>
                     <p>"I know that you are incredulous," interrupted the Baron.</p>
                     <p>"Well, call it what you will, I meant to ſay, that, though you know I am free from ſuperſtition—if any thing ſupernatural has appeared. I doubt not it will appear to me, and if any ſtrange event hangs over my houſe, or if any extraordinary tranſaction has formerly been connected with it, I ſhall probably be made acquainted with it. At all events I will invite diſcovery; and, that I may be equal to a mortal attack, which in good truth, my friend, is what I moſt expect, I ſhall take care to be well armed."</p>
                     <p>The Count took leave of his family, for the night, with an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed gaiety, which but ill concealed the anxiety, that depreſſed his ſpirits, and retired to the north apartments, accompanied by his ſon and followed by the Baron, M. Du Pont and ſome of the domeſtics, who all bade him good night at the outer door. In theſe chambers every thing appeared as when he had laſt been here; even in the bed room no alteration was viſible, where he lighted his own fire, for none of the domeſtics could be prevailed upon to venture thither. After carefully examining the chamber and the oriel, the Count and Henri drew their chairs upon the hearth, ſet a bottle of wine and a lamp before them, laid their ſwords upon the table, and, ſtirring the wood into a blaze, began to converſe on indifferent topics. But Henri was often ſilent and abſtracted, and ſometimes threw a glance of mingled awe and curioſity round the gloomy apartment; while the Count gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ceaſed to converſe, and ſat either loſt in thought, or reading a volume of Tacitus, which he had brought to beguile the tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the night.</p>

                     <p>THE Baron St. Foix, whom anxiety for his friend had kept awake, roſe early to inquire the event of the night, when, as he paſſed the Count's cloſet, hearing ſteps within, he knocked at the door, and it was opened by his friend himſelf. Rejoicing to ſee him in ſafety, and curious to learn the occurrences of the night, he had not immediately leiſure to obſerve the unuſual gravity, that overſpread the features of the Count, whoſe reſerved anſwers firſt occaſioned him to notice it. The Count, then ſmil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, endeavoured to treat the ſubject of his curioſity with levity; but the Baron was ſerious, and purſued his inquiries ſo cloſely, that the Count, at length, reſuming his gravity, ſaid, "Well, my friend, preſs the ſubject no further, I entreat you; and let me requeſt alſo, that you will hereafter be ſilent upon any thing you may think extraordinary in my future conduct. I do not ſcruple to tell you, that I am unhappy, and that the watch of the laſt night has not aſſiſted me to diſcover Ludovico; upon every occurrence of the night you muſt excuſe my reſerve."</p>
                     <p>"But where is Henri?" ſaid the Baron, with ſurpriſe and diſappointment at this denial.</p>
                     <p>"He is well in his own apartment," replied the Count. "You will not queſtion him on this topic, my friend, ſince you know my wiſh."</p>
                     <p>"Certainly not," ſaid the Baron ſomewhat chagrined, "ſince it would be diſpleaſing to you; but methinks, my friend, you might rely on my diſcretion, and drop this unuſual reſerve. However, you muſt allow me to ſuſpect, that you have ſeen rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to become a convert to my ſyſtem, and are no longer the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous knight you lately appeared to be."</p>
                     <p>"Let us talk no more upon this ſubject," ſaid the Count; "you may be aſſured, that no ordinary circumſtance has impoſed this ſilence upon me towards a friend, whom I have called ſo for near thirty years; and my preſent reſerve cannot make you queſtion either my eſteem, or the ſincerity of my friendſhip."</p>
                     <p>"I will not doubt either," ſaid the Baron, "though you muſt allow me to expreſs my ſurpriſe, at this ſilence."</p>
                     <p>"To me I will allow it," replied the Count, "but I earneſtly entreat that you will forbear to notice it to my family, as well as every thing remarkable you may obſerve in my conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="134" facs="unknown:029378_0294_0FE0873CD58EE008"/>
The Baron readily promiſed this, and, after converſing for ſometime on general topics, they deſcended to the breakfaſt room, where the Count met his family with a cheerful countenance, and evaded their inquiries by employing light ridicule, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming an air of uncommon gaiety, while he aſſured them, that they need not apprehend any evil from the north chambers, ſince Henri and himſelf had been permitted to return from them in ſafety.</p>
                     <p>Henri, however, was leſs ſucceſsful in diſguiſing his feelings. From his countenance an expreſſion of terror was not entirely fad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; he was often ſilent and thoughtful, and, when he attempted to laugh at the eager inquiries of Mademoiſelle Bearn, it was evidently only an attempt.</p>
                     <p>In the evening, the Count called, as he had promiſed, at the convent, and Emily was ſurpriſed to perceive a mixture of play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ridicule and of reſerve in his mention of the north apartment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Of what had occurred there, however, he ſaid nothing, and, when ſhe ventured to remind him of his promiſe to tell her the reſult of his inquiries, and to aſk if he had received any proof, that thoſe chambers were haunted, his look became ſolemn, for a moment, then, ſeeming to recollect himſelf, he ſmiled, and ſaid, "My dear Emily, do not ſuffer my lady abbeſs to infect your good underſtanding with theſe fancies; ſhe will teach you to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a ghoſt in every dark room. But believe me," added he, with a profound ſigh, "the apparition of the dead comes not on light or ſportive errands, to terrify, or to ſurpriſe the timid." He pauſed, and fell into a momentary thoughtfulneſs, and then added, "We will ſay no more on this ſubject."</p>
                     <p>Soon after, he took leave, and, when Emily joined ſome of the nuns, ſhe was ſurpriſed to find them acquainted with a circumſtance which ſhe had carefully avoided to mention, and expreſſing their admiration of his intrepidity in having dared to paſs a night in the apartment, whence Ludovico had diſappear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for ſhe had not conſidered with what rapidity a tale of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der circulates. The nuns had acquired their information from peaſants, who brought fruit to the monaſtery, and whoſe whole attention had been fixed, ſince the diſappearance of Ludovico, on what was paſſing in the caſtle.</p>
                     <p>Emily liſtened in ſilence to the various opinions of the nuns, concerning the, conduct of the Count, moſt of whom condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it as raſh and preſumptuous, affirming, that it was provoking the vengeance of an evil ſpirit, thus to intrude upon its haunts.</p>
                     <p>Siſter Frances contended, that the Count had acted with the bravery of a virtuous mind. He knew himſelf guiltleſs of
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:029378_0294_0FE0873CD58EE008"/>
aught, that ſhould provoke a good ſpirit, and did not fear the ſpells of an evil one, ſince he could claim the protection of an higher Power, of Him, who can command the wicked and will protect the innocent.</p>
                     <p>"The guilty cannot claim that protection!" ſaid ſiſter Agnes, "let the Count look to his conduct, that he do not forfeit his claim! Yet who is he, that ſhall dare to call himſelf innocent!—all earthly innocence is but comparative. Yet ſtill how wide aſunder are the extremes of guilt, and to what an horrible depth may we fall! Oh!"—</p>
                     <p>The nun, as ſhe concluded, uttered a ſhuddering ſigh, that ſtartled Emily, who, looking up, perceived the eyes of Agnes fixed on hers, after which the ſiſter roſe, took her hand, gazed earneſtly upon her countenance, for ſome moments, in ſilence, and then ſaid,</p>
                     <p>"You are young—you are innocent! I mean you are yet inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of any great crime!—But you have paſſions in your heart,—ſcorpions; they ſleep now—beware how you awaken them!—they will ſting you, even unto death!"</p>
                     <p>Emily, affected by theſe words and by the ſolemnity, with which they were delivered, could not ſuppreſs her tears.</p>
                     <p>"Ah! is it ſo?" exclaimed Agnes, her countenance ſoften<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from its ſternneſs—"ſo young, and ſo unfortunate! We are ſiſters, then indeed. Yet, there is no bond of kindneſs among the guilty," ſhe added, while her eyes reſumed their wild ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, "no gentleneſs,—no peace, no hope! I knew them all once—my eyes could weep—but now they burn, for now, my ſoul is fixed and fearleſs!—I lament no more!"</p>
                     <p>"Rather let us repent, and pray," ſaid another nun. "We are taught to hope, that prayer and penitence will work our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. There is hope for all who repent!"</p>
                     <p>"Who repent and turn to the true faith," obſerved ſiſter Frances.</p>
                     <p>"For all but me!" replied Agnes ſolemnly, who pauſed, and then abruptly added, "My head burns, I believe I am not well. O! could I ſtrike from my memory all former ſcenes—the fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures that riſe up like furies, to torment me!—I ſee them when I ſleep, and, when I am awake, they are ſtill before my eyes! I ſee them now—now!</p>
                     <p>She ſtood in a fixed attitude of horror, her ſtraining eyes mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſlowly round the room, as if they followed ſomething. One of the nuns gently took her hand, to lead her from the parlour. Agnes became calm, drew her other hand acroſs her eyes, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:029378_0295_0FE08742D49EBB78"/>
again, and, ſighing deeply, ſaid, "They are gone—they are gone! I am feveriſh, I know not what I ſay. I am thus, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, but it will go off again, I ſhall ſoon be better. Was not that the veſper bell?"</p>
                     <p>"No," replied Frances, "the evening ſervice is paſſed. Let Margaret lead you to your cell."</p>
                     <p>"You are right," replied ſiſter Agnes, "I ſhall be better there. Good night, my ſiſters, remember me in your oriſons!"</p>
                     <p>When they had withdrawn, Frances, obſerving Emily's emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſaid, "Do not be alarmed, our ſiſter is often thus derang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed though I have not lately ſeen her ſo frantic; her uſual mood is melancholy. This fit has been coming on, for ſeveral days; ſecluſion and the cuſtomary treatment will reſtore her."</p>
                     <p>"But how rationally ſhe converſed, at firſt!" obſerved Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly," "her ideas followed each other in perfect order."</p>
                     <p>"Yes," replied the nun, "this is nothing new; nay, I have ſometimes known her argue not only with method, but with acuteneſs, and then, in a moment, ſtart off into madneſs."</p>
                     <p>"Her conſcience ſeems afflicted," ſaid Emily, "did you ever hear what circumſtance reduced her to this deplorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition?"</p>
                     <p>"I have," replied the nun, who ſaid no more till Emily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated the queſtion, when ſhe added in a low voice, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſignificantly towards the other boarders, "I cannot tell you now, but, if you think it worth your while, come to my cell, to night, when our ſiſterhood are at reſt, and you ſhall hear more; but remember we riſe to midnight prayers, and come either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or after midnight."</p>
                     <p>Emily promiſed to remember, and the abbeſs ſoon after ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, they ſpoke no more of the unhappy nun.</p>
                     <p>The Count, meanwhile, on his return home, had found M. Du Pont in one of thoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>its of deſpondency, which his attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Emily frequently occaſioned him, an attachment, that had ſubſiſted too long to be eaſily ſubdued, and which had already outlived the oppoſition of his friends. M. Du Pont had firſt ſeen Emily in Gaſcony, during the lifetime of his parent, who, on diſcovering his ſon's partiality for Mademoiſelle St. Aubert, his inferior in point of fortune, forbade him to declare it to her family, or to think of her more. During the life of his father, he had obſerved the firſt command, but had found it impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to obey the ſecond, and had, ſometimes ſoothed his paſſion by viſiting her favourite haunts, among which was the fiſhing houſe, where once or twice, he addreſſed her in verſe, concealing
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:029378_0295_0FE08742D49EBB78"/>
his name, in obedience to the promiſe he had given his father. There too he played the pathetic air, to which ſhe had liſtened with ſuch ſurpriſe and admiration; and there he found the miniature that had ſince cheriſhed a paſſion fatal to his repoſe. During his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition into Italy, his father died; but he received his liberty at a moment, when he was the leaſt enabled to profit by it, ſince the object that rendered it moſt valuable, was no longer within the reach of his vows. By what accident he diſcovered Emily, and aſſiſted to releaſe her from a terrible impriſonment, has already appeared, and alſo the unavailing hope, with which he then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged his love, and the fruitleſs efforts, that he had ſince made to overcome it.</p>
                     <p>The Count ſtill endeavoured, with friendly zeal, to ſooth him with a belief, that patience, perſeverance and prudence, would finally obtain for him happineſs and Emily; "Time," ſaid he, "will wear away the melancholy impreſſion, which diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has left on her mind, and ſhe will be ſenſible of your merit. Your ſervices have already awakened her gratitude, and your ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erings her pity; and truſt me, my friend, in a heart ſo ſenſible as hers, gratitude and pity lead to love. When her imagination is reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued from its preſent deluſion, ſhe will readily accept the hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of a mind like yours."</p>
                     <p>Du Pont ſighed, while he liſtened to theſe words; and, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to hope what his friend believed, he willingly yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to an invitation to prolong his viſit at the chateau, which we now leave for the monaſtery of St. Claire.</p>
                     <p>When the nuns had retired to reſt, Emily ſtole to her appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with ſiſter Frances, whom ſhe found in her cell, engaged in prayer, before a little table, where appeared the image ſhe was addreſſing, and above, the dim lamp, that gave light to the place. Turning her eyes, as the door opened, ſhe beckoned to Emily to come in, who having done ſo, ſeated herſelf in ſilence beſide the nun's little mattreſs of ſtraw, till her oriſons ſhould conclude. The latter ſoon roſe from her knees, and, taking down the lamp and placing it on the table, Emily perceived there a human ſcull and bones, lying beſide an hour glaſs; but the nun, without obſerving her emotion, ſat down on the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs by her, ſaying, "Your curioſity, ſiſter, has made you punct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual, but you have nothing remarkable to hear in the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of poor Agnes, of whom I avoided to ſpeak in the preſence of my lay ſiſters, only becauſe I would not publiſh her crime to them."</p>
                     <p>"I ſhall conſider your confidence in me as a favour," ſaid Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily, "and will not miſuſe it."</p>

"Siſter Agnes," reſumed the nun, "is of a noble family, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s the dignity of her air muſt already have informed you, but I will not diſhonour their name ſo much as to reveal it. Love was the occaſion of her crime and of her madneſs. She was beloved by a gentleman of inferior fortune, and her father, as I have heard, beſtowing her on a nobleman, whom ſhe diſliked, an ill governed paſſion proved her deſtruction.—Every obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of virtue and of duty was forgotten, and ſhe prophaned her marriage vows; but her guilt was ſoon detected, and ſhe would have fallen a ſacrifice to the vengeance of her huſband, had not her father contrived to convey her from his power. By what means he did this, I never could learn; but he ſecreted her in this convent, where he afterwards prevailed with her to take the veil, while a report was circulated in the world, that ſhe was dead, and the father, to ſave his daughter, aſſiſted the rumour, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed ſuch means as induced her huſband to believe ſhe had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a victim to his jealouſy. You look ſurpriſed," added the nun, obſerving Emily's countenance; "I allow the ſtory is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common, but not, I believe, without a parallel."</p>
                     <p>"Pray proceed," ſaid Emily, "I am intereſted."</p>
                     <p>"The ſtory is already told," reſumed the nun, "I have only to mention, that the long ſtruggle, which Agnes ſuffered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween love, remorſe and a ſenſe of the duties ſhe had taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on herſelf in becoming of our order, at length unſettled her rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. At firſt, ſhe was frantic and melancholy by quick alterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; then ſhe ſunk into a deep and ſettled melancholy, which ſtill, however, has at times, been interrupted by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>its of wildneſs, and, of late, theſe have again been frequent."</p>
                     <p>Emily was affected by the hiſtory of the ſiſter, ſome parts of whoſe ſtory brought to her remembrance that of the Marchion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs de Villeroi, who had alſo been compelled by her father to forſake the object of her affections, for a nobleman of his choice, but, from what Dorothee had related, there appeared no reaſon to ſuppoſe, that ſhe had eſcaped the vengeance of a jealous huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, or to doubt for a moment the innocence of her conduct. But Emily, while ſhe ſighed over the miſery of the nun, could not forbear ſhedding a few tears to the misfortunes of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs; and when ſhe returned to the mention of ſiſter Agnes, ſhe aſked Frances if ſhe remembered her in her youth, and whether ſhe was then beautiful.</p>
                     <p>"I was not here at the time, when ſhe took the vows," replied Frances, "which is ſo long ago, that few of the preſent ſiſterhood, I believe, were witneſſes of the ceremony; nay, even our lady

mother did not then preſide over the convent: but I can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, when ſiſter Agnes was a very beautiful woman. She retains that air of high rank, which always diſtinguiſhed her, but her beauty, you muſt perceive, is fled; I can ſcarcely diſcover even a veſtige of the lovelineſs, that once animated her features."</p>
                     <p>"It is ſtrange," ſaid Emily, "but there are moments, when her countenance has appeared familiar to my memory! You will think me fanciful, and I think myſelf ſo, for I certainly nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſaw ſiſter Agnes, before I came to this convent, and I muſt, therefore, have ſeen ſome perſon, whom ſhe ſtrongly reſembles, though of this I have no recollection."</p>
                     <p>"You have been intereſted by the deep melancholy of her countenance," ſaid Frances, "and its impreſſion has probably deluded your imagination; for I might as reaſonably think I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a likeneſs between you and Agnes, as you, that you have ſeen her any where but in this convent, ſince this has been her place of refuge, for nearly as many years as make your age."</p>
                     <p>"Indeed!" ſaid Emily.</p>
                     <p>"Yes," rejoined Frances, "and why does that circumſtance excite your ſurpriſe?"</p>
                     <p>Emily did not appear to notice this queſtion, but remained thoughtful, for a few moments, and then ſaid, "It was about that ſame period that the Marchioneſs de Villeroi expired."</p>
                     <p>"That is an odd remark," ſaid Frances.</p>
                     <p>Emily, recalled from her reverie, ſmiled, and gave the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation another turn, but it ſoon came back to the ſubject of the unhappy nun, and Emily remained in the cell of ſiſter Frances, till the midnight bell arouſed her; when apologizing for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing interrupted the ſiſter's repoſe, till this late hour, they quitted the cell together. Emily returned to her chamber, and the nun, bearing a glimmering taper, went to her devotion in the chapel.</p>
                     <p>Several days followed, during which Emily ſaw neither the Count, or any of his family; and, when, at length, he appeared, ſhe remarked, with concern, that his air was unuſually diſturbed.</p>
                     <p>"My ſpirits are harraſſed," ſaid he, in anſwer to her anxious inquiries, 'and I mean to change my reſidence for a little while, an experiment, which, I hope, will reſtore my mind to its uſual tranquillity. My daughter and myſelf will accompany the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron St. Foix to his chateau. It lies in a valley of the Pyrenees, that opens towards Gaſcony, and I have been thinking, Emily, that when you ſet out for La Vallee, we may go part of the way together; it would be a ſatisfaction to me to guard you towards your home.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="140" facs="unknown:029378_0297_0FE08752E235F328"/>
She thanked the Count for his friendly conſideration, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, that the neceſſity for her going firſt to Tholouſe would render this plan impracticable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "But, when you are at the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron's reſidence," ſhe added, "you will be only a ſhort journey from La Vallee, and I think, ſir, you will not leave the country without viſiting me; it is unneceſſary to ſay with what pleaſure I ſhould receive you and the Lady Blanche."</p>
                     <p>"I do not doubt it," replied the Count, "and I will not deny myſelf and Blanche the pleaſure of viſiting you, if your affairs ſhould allow you to be at La Vallee, about the time when we can meet you there."</p>
                     <p>When Emily ſaid that ſhe ſhould hope to ſee the Counteſs alſo, ſhe was not ſorry to learn that this lady was going, accompanied by Mademoiſelle Bearn, to pay a viſit, for a few weeks, to a family in lower Languedoc.</p>
                     <p>The Count, after ſome further converſation on his intended journey and on the arrangement of Emily's, took leave; and many days did not ſucceed this viſit, before a ſecond letter from M. Queſnel informed her, that he was then at Tholouſe, that La Valle was at liberty, and that he wiſhed her to ſet off for the former place, where he awaited her arrival, with all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible diſpatch, ſince his own affairs preſſed him to return to Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cony. Emily did not heſitate to obey him, and, having taken an affecting leave of the Count's family, in which M. Du Pont was ſtill included, and of her friends at the convent, ſhe ſet out for Tholouſe, attended by the unhappy Annette, and guarded by a ſteady ſervant of the Count.</p>

                     <p>EMILY purſued her journey, without any accident, along the plains of Languedoc towards the north weſt; and, on this her return to Tholouſe, which ſhe had laſt left with Madame Montoni, ſhe thought much on the melancholy fate of her aunt, who, but for her own imprudence, might now have been living in happineſs there! Montoni, to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, often roſe to her fancy, ſuch
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:029378_0297_0FE08752E235F328"/>
as ſhe had ſeen him in his days of triumph, bold, ſpirited and commanding; ſuch alſo as ſhe had ſince beheld him in his days of vengeance; and now, only a few ſhort months had paſſed—and he had no longer the power, or the will to afflict;—he had become a clod of earth, and his life was vaniſhed like a ſhadow! Emily could have wept at his fate, had ſhe not remembered his crimes; for that of her unfortunate aunt ſhe did weep, and all ſenſe of her errors was overcome by the recollection of her miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes.</p>
                     <p>Other thoughts and other emotions ſucceeded, as Emily drew near the well known ſcenes of her early love, and conſidered, that Valancourt was loſt to her and to himſelf, for ever. At length, ſhe came to the brow of the hill, whence, on her departure for Italy, ſhe had given a farewel look to this beloved landſcape, amongſt whoſe woods and fields ſhe had ſo often walked with Valancourt, and where he was then to inhabit, when ſhe would be far, far away! She ſaw, once more, that chain of the Pyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nees, which overlooked La Vallee, riſing, like faint clouds, on the horizon. "There, too, is Gaſcony, extended at their feet!" ſaid ſhe, "O my father,—my mother! And there, too, is the Garonne!" ſhe added, drying the tears, that obſcured her ſight, "and Tholouſe, and my aunt's manſion, and the groves in her gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den!—O my friends! are ye all loſt to me—muſt I never, never ſee ye more!" Tears ruſhed again to her eyes, and ſhe continued to weep, till an abrupt turn in the road had nearly occaſioned the carriage to overſet, when, looking up, ſhe perceived another part of the well known ſcene around Tholouſe, and all the reflections and anticipations, which ſhe had ſuffered, at the moment, when ſhe bade it laſt adieu, came with recollected force to her heart. She remembered how anxiouſly ſhe had looked forward to the futurity, which was to decide her happineſs concerning Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court, and what depreſſing fears had aſſailed her; the very words ſhe had uttered, as ſhe withdrew her laſt look from the proſpect, came to her memory. "Could I but be certain," ſhe had then ſaid, "that I ſhould ever return, and that Valancourt would ſtill live for me—I ſhould go in peace!"</p>
                     <p>Now, that futurity, ſo anxiouſly anticipated, was arrived, ſhe was returned—but what a dreary blank appeared!—Valancourt no longer lived for her! She had no longer even the melancholy ſatisfaction of contemplating his image in her heart, for he was no longer the ſame Valancourt ſhe had cheriſhed there—the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of many a mournful hour, the animating friend, that had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled her to bear up againſt the oppreſſion of Montoni—the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:029378_0298_0FE0876334D75BE8"/>
hope, that had beamed over her gloomy proſpect! On per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving this beloved idea to be an illuſion of her own creation, Valancourt ſeemed to be annihilated, and her ſoul ſickened at the blank, that remained. His marriage with a rival, even his death, ſhe thought ſhe could have endured with more fortitude, than this diſcovery; for then, amidſt all her grief, ſhe could have looked in ſecret upon the image of goodneſs, which her fancy had drawn of him, and comfort would have mingled with her ſuffering!</p>
                     <p>Drying her tears, ſhe looked once more upon the landſcape, which had excited them, and perceived, that ſhe was paſſing the very bank where ſhe had taken leave of Valancourt, on the morning of her departure from Tholouſe, and ſhe now ſaw him, through her returning tears, ſuch as he had appeared, when ſhe looked from the carriage to give him a laſt adieu—ſaw him leaning mournfully againſt the high trees, and remembered the fixed look of mingled tenderneſs and anguiſh, with which he had then regarded her. This recollection was too much for her heart, and ſhe ſunk back in the carriage, nor once looked up, till it ſtopped at the gates of what was now her own manſion.</p>
                     <p>Theſe being opened, and by the ſervant, to whoſe care the chateau had been entruſted, the carriage drove into the court, where, alighting, ſhe haſtily paſſed through the great hall, now ſilent and ſolitary, to a large oak parlour, the common ſitting room of the late Madame Montoni, where, inſtead of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by M. Queſnel, ſhe found a letter from him, informing her, that buſineſs of conſequence had obliged him to leave Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe two days before. Emily was, upon the whole, not ſorry to be ſpared his preſence, ſince his abrupt departure appeared to indicate the ſame indifference, with which he had formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded her. This letter informed her, alſo, of the progreſs he had made in the ſettlement of her affairs, and concluded with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, concerning the forms of ſome buſineſs, which remained for her to tranſact. But M. Queſnel's unkindneſs did not long occupy her thoughts, which returned to the remembrance of the perſons ſhe had been accuſtomed to ſee in this manſion, and chiefly of the ill guided and unfortunate Madame Montoni. In the room, where ſhe now ſat, ſhe had breakfaſted with her on the morning of their departure for Italy; and the view of it brought moſt forcibly to her recollection all ſhe had herſelf ſuffered, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> that time, and the many gay expectations, which her aunt had formed, reſpecting the journey before her. While Emily's mind was thus engaged, her eyes wandered unconſciouſly to a large
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:029378_0298_0FE0876334D75BE8"/>
window, that looked upon the garden, and here new memorials of the paſt ſpoke to her heart, for ſhe ſaw extended before her, the very avenue, in which ſhe had parted with Valancourt, on the eve of her journey; and all the anxiety, the tender intereſt he had ſhewn, concerning her future happineſs, his earneſt remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances againſt her committing herſelf to the power of Montoni, and the truth of his affection, came afreſh to her memory. At this moment, it appeared almoſt impoſſible, that Valancourt could have become unworthy of her regard, and ſhe doubted all that ſhe had lately heard to his diſadvantage, and even his own words, which had confirmed Count De Villefort's report of him. Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the recollections, which the view of this avenue occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned, ſhe turned abruptly from the window, and ſunk into a chair beſide it, where ſhe ſat, given up to grief, till the entrance of Annette, with coffee, arouſed her.</p>
                     <p>"Dear madam, how melancholy this place looks now," ſaid Annette, "to what it uſed to do! It is diſmal coming home, when there is nobody to welcome one!"</p>
                     <p>This was not the moment, in which Emily could bear the remark; her tears fell again, and as ſoon as ſhe had taken the coffee, ſhe retired to her apartment, where ſhe endeavoured to repoſe her fatigued ſpirits. But buſy memory would ſtill ſupply her with the viſions of former times: ſhe ſaw Valancourt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting and benevolent, as he had been wont to appear in the days of their early love, and, amidſt the ſcenes, where ſhe had believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they ſhould ſometimes paſs their years together!—but, at length, ſleep cloſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> theſe afflicting ſcenes from her view.</p>
                     <p>On the following morning, ſerious occupation recovered her from ſuch melancholy reflections; for, being deſirous of quitting Tholouſe, and of haſtening on to La Vallee, ſhe made ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries into the condition of the eſtate, and immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched a part of the neceſſary buſineſs concerning it, according to the directions of Monſ. Queſnel. It required a ſtrong effort to abſtract her thoughts from other intereſts ſufficiently to attend to this, but ſhe was rewarded for her exertions by again experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encing, that employment is the ſureſt antidote to ſorrow.</p>
                     <p>This day was devoted entirely to buſineſs; and, among other concerns, ſhe employed means to learn the ſituation of all her poor tenants, that ſhe might relieve their wants, or confirm their comforts.</p>
                     <p>In the evening, her ſpirits were ſo much ſtrengthened, that ſhe thought ſhe could bear to viſit the gardens, where ſhe had ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> walked with Valancourt; and, knowing, that, if ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:029378_0299_0FE087680C134348"/>
to do ſo, their ſcenes would only affect her the more, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ſhould be viewed, ſhe took advantage of the preſent ſtate of her mind, and entered them.</p>
                     <p>Paſſing haſtily the gate leading from the court into the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, ſhe hurried up the great avenue, ſcarcely permitting her memory to dwell for a moment on the circumſtance of her hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here parted with Valancourt, and ſoon quitted this for other walks leſs intereſting to her heart. Theſe brought her, at length, to the flight of ſteps, that led from the lower garden to the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race, on ſeeing which, ſhe became agitated, and heſitated whether to aſcend, but, her reſolution returning, ſhe proceeded.</p>
                     <p>"Ah!" ſaid Emily, as ſhe aſcended, "theſe are the ſame high trees, that uſed to wave over the terrace, and theſe the ſame flowery thickets—the libernum, the wild roſe, and the cerinthe, which were wont to grow beneath them! Ah! and there, too, on that bank, are the very plants, which Valancourt ſo carefully reared!—O when laſt I ſaw them!"—She checked the thought, but could not reſtrain her tears, and, after walking ſlowly on for a few moments, her agitation, upon the view of this well known ſcene, increaſed ſo much, that ſhe was obliged to ſtop, and lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> upon the wall of the terrace. It was a mild, and beautiful even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The ſun was ſetting over the extenſive landſcape, to which his beams, ſloping from beneath a dark cloud, that overhung the weſt, gave rich and partial colouring, and touched the tufted ſummits of the groves, that roſe from the garden below, with a yellow gleam. Emily and Valancourt had often admired to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether this ſcene, at the ſame hour; and it was exactly on this ſpot, that, on the night preceding her departure for Italy, ſhe had liſtened to his remonſtrances againſt the journey, and to the pleadings of paſſionate affection. Some obſervations, which ſhe made on the landſcape, brought this to her remembrance, and with it all the minute particulars of that converſation: the alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doubts he had expreſſed concerning Montoni, doubts, which had ſince been fatally confirmed; the reaſons and entreaties he had employed to prevail with her to conſent to an immediate marriage; the tenderneſs of his love, the paroxyſms of his grief, and the conviction he had repeatedly expreſſed, that they ſhould never meet again in happineſs! All theſe circumſtances roſe afreſh to her mind, and awakened the various emotions ſhe had then ſuffered. Her tenderneſs for Valancourt became as power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as in the moments, when ſhe thought, that ſhe was parting with him and happineſs together, and when the ſtrength of her mind had enabled her to triumph over preſent ſuffering, rather
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:029378_0299_0FE087680C134348"/>
than to deſerve the reproach of her conſcience by engaging in a clandeſtine marriage. "Alas!" ſaid Emily, as theſe recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions came to her mind, "and what have I gained by the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude I then practiſed?—am I happy now?—He ſaid, we ſhould meet no more in happineſs; but, O! he little thought his own miſconduct would ſeparate us, and lead to the very evil he then dreaded!"</p>
                     <p>Her reflections increaſed her anguiſh, while ſhe was compell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to acknowledge, that the fortitude ſhe had formerly exerted, if it had not conducted her to happineſs, had ſaved her from irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trievable misfortune—from Valancourt himſelf! But in theſe moments ſhe could not congratulate herſelf on the prudence, that had ſaved her; ſhe could only lament, with bittereſt anguiſh, the circumſtances, which had conſpired to betray Valancourt into a courſe of life ſo different from that, which the virtues, the taſte, and the purſuits of his early years had promiſed; but ſhe ſtill loved him too well to believe, that his heart was even now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, though his conduct had been criminal. An obſervation, which had fallen from M. St. Aubert more than once, now oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to her. "This young man," ſaid he, ſpeaking of Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court, "has never been at Paris;" a remark, that had ſurpriſed her at the time it was uttered, but which ſhe now underſtood, and ſhe exclaimed ſorrowfully, "O Valancourt! if ſuch a friend as my father had been with you at Paris—your noble, ingenuous nature would not have fallen!"</p>
                     <p>The ſun was now ſet, and, recalling her thoughts from their mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholy ſubject, ſhe continued her walk; for the penſive ſhade of twilight was pleaſing to her, and the nightingales from the ſurrounding groves began to anſwer each other in the long drawn, plaintive note, which always touched her heart; while all the fragrance of the flowery thickets, that bounded the terrace, was awakened by the cool evening air, which floated ſo lightly among their leaves, that they ſcarcely trembled as it paſſed.</p>
                     <p>Emily came, at length, to the ſteps of the pavilion, that ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated the terrace, and where her laſt interview with Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court, before her departure from Tholouſe, had ſo unexpectedly taken place. The door was now ſhut, and ſhe trembled, while ſhe heſitated whether to open it; but her wiſh to ſee again a place, which had been the chief ſcene of her former happineſs, at length overcoming her reluctance to encounter the painful regret it would renew, ſhe entered. The room was obſcured by a mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholy ſhade; but through the open lattices, darkened by the hanging foliage of the vines, appeared the duſky landſcape, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="146" facs="unknown:029378_0300_0FE087738818B160"/>
Garonne reflecting the evening light, and the weſt ſtill glowing. A chair was placed near one of the balconies, as if ſome perſon had been ſitting there, but the other furniture of the pavilion remained exactly as uſual, and Emily thought it looked as if it had not once been moved ſince ſhe ſet out for Italy. The ſilent and deſerted air of the place added ſolemnity to her emotions, for ſhe heard only the low whiſper of the breeze, as it ſhook the leaves of the vines, and the very faint murmur of the Garonne.</p>
                     <p>She ſeated herſelf in a chair, near the lattice, and yielded to the ſadneſs of her heart, while ſhe recollected the circumſtances of her parting interview with Valancourt, on this ſpot. It was here too, that ſhe had paſſed ſome of the happieſt hours of her life with him, when her aunt favoured the connection, for here ſhe had often ſat and worked, while he converſed, or read; and ſhe now well remembered with what diſcriminating judgment, with what tempered energy, he uſed to repeat ſome of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limeſt paſſages of their favourite authors; how often he would pauſe to admire with her their excellence, and with what ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der delight he would liſten to her remarks, and correct her taſte.</p>
                     <p>"And is it poſſible," ſaid Emily, as theſe recollections re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, "is it poſſible, that a mind ſo ſuſceptible of whatever is grand and beautiful, could ſtoop to low purſuits, and be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued by frivolous temptations?"</p>
                     <p>She remembered how often ſhe had ſeen the ſudden tear ſtart in his eye, and had heard his voice tremble with emotion, while he related any great or benevolent action, or repeated a ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſame character. "And ſuch a mind," ſaid ſhe, "ſuch a heart, were to be ſacrificed to the habits of a great city!"</p>
                     <p>Theſe recollections becoming too painful to be endured, ſhe abruptly left the pavilion, and, anxious to eſcape from the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials of her departed happineſs, returned towards the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau. As ſhe paſſed along the terrace, ſhe perceived a perſon, walking with a ſlow ſtep, and a dejected air, under the trees, at ſome diſtance. The twilight, which was now deep, would not allow her to diſtinguiſh who it was, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe imagined it to be one of the ſervants, till, the ſound of her ſteps ſeeming to reach him, he turned half round, and ſhe thought ſhe ſaw Valancourt!</p>
                     <p>Whoever it was, he inſtantly ſtruck among the thickets on the left, and diſappeared, while Emily, her eyes fixed on the place whence he had vaniſhed, and her frame trembling ſo exceſſively, that ſhe could ſcarcely ſupport herſelf, remained, for ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, unable to quit the ſpot, and ſcarcely conſcious of exiſtence.
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:029378_0300_0FE087738818B160"/>
With her recollection, her ſtrength returned, and ſhe hurried to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the houſe, where ſhe did not venture to inquire who had been in the gardens, leſt ſhe ſhould betray her emotion; and ſhe ſat down alone, endeavouring, to recollect the figure, air and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the perſon ſhe had juſt ſeen. Her view of him, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, had been ſo tranſient, and the gloom had rendered it ſo imperfect, that ſhe could remember nothing with exactneſs; yet the general appearance of his figure, and his abrupt departure, made her ſtill believe that this perſon was Valancourt. Sometimes, indeed, ſhe thought, that her fancy, which had been occupied by the idea of him, had ſuggeſted his image to her uncertain ſight: but this conjecture was fleeting. If it was himſelf, whom ſhe had ſeen, ſhe wondered much, that he ſhould be at Tholouſe, and more, how he had gained admittance into the garden; but as often as her impatience prompted her to inquire whether any ſtranger had been admitted, ſhe was reſtrained by an unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to betray her doubts, and the evening was paſſed in anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conjecture, and in efforts to diſmiſs the ſubject from her thoughts. But theſe endeavours were ineffectual, and a thouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and inconſiſtent emotions aſſailed her, whenever ſhe fancied that Valancourt might be near her; now ſhe dreaded it to be true, and now ſhe feared it to be falſe; and, while ſhe conſtantly tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to perſuade herſelf, that ſhe wiſhed the perſon, whom ſhe had ſeen, might not be Valancourt, her heart as conſtantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted her reaſon.</p>
                     <p>The following day was occupied by the viſits of ſeveral neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring families, formerly intimate with Madame Montoni, who came to condole with Emily on her death, to congratulate her upon the acquiſition of theſe eſtates, and to inquire about Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni, and concerning the ſtrange reports they had heard of her own ſituation; all which was done with the utmoſt decorum, and the viſitors departed with as much compoſure as they had arrived.</p>
                     <p>Emily was wearied by theſe formalities, and diſguſted by the ſubſervient manners of many perſons, who had thought her ſcarcely worthy of common attention, while ſhe was believed to be a dependant of Madame Montoni.</p>
                     <p>"Surely," ſaid ſhe, "there is ſome magic in wealth, which can thus make perſons pay their court to it, when it does not even bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit themſelves. How ſtrange it is that a fool or a knave, with riches, ſhould be treated with more reſpect by the world, than a good man, or a wiſe man in poverty!"</p>
                     <p>It was evening, before ſhe was left alone, and ſhe then wiſhed to have refreſhed her ſpirits, in the free air of her garden; but
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:029378_0301_0FE087791BC95B88"/>
ſhe feared to go thither, leſt ſhe ſhould meet again the perſon, whom ſhe had ſeen on the preceding night, and he ſhould prove to be Valancourt. The ſuſpenſe and anxiety ſhe ſuffered, on this ſubject, ſhe found all her efforts unable to controul, and her ſecret wiſh to ſee Valancourt once more, though unſeen by him, powerfully prompted her to go, but prudence and a delicate pride reſtrained her, and ſhe determined to avoid the poſſibility of throwing herſelf in his way, by forbearing to viſit the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, for ſeveral days.</p>
                     <p>When, after near a week, ſhe again ventured thither, ſhe made Annette her companion, and confined her walk to the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er grounds, but often ſtarted as the leaves ruſtled in the breeze, imagining, that ſome perſon was among the thickets; and, at the turn of every alley, ſhe looked forward with apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive expectation. She purſued her walk thoughtfully and ſilent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for her agitation would not ſuffer her to converſe with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette, to whom, however, thought and ſilence were ſo intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that ſhe did not ſcruple at length to talk to her miſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>"Dear madam," ſaid ſhe, "why do you ſtart ſo? one would think you knew what has happened."</p>
                     <p>"What has happened?" ſaid Emily in a faltering voice, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> trying to command her emotion.</p>
                     <p>"The night before laſt, you know, madam"—</p>
                     <p>"I know nothing, Annette," replied her lady in a more hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried voice.</p>
                     <p>"The night before laſt, madam, there was a robber in the garden."</p>
                     <p>"A robber," ſaid Emily, in an eager, yet doubting tone.</p>
                     <p>"I ſuppoſe he was a robber, madam. What elſe could he he?"</p>
                     <p>"Where did you ſee him, Annette?" rejoined Emily, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round her, and turning back towards the chateau.</p>
                     <p>"It was not I that ſaw him, madam, it was Jean the garden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. It was twelve o'clock at night, and as he was coming acroſs the court to go the back way into the houſe, what ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e ſee—but ſomebody walking in the avenue, that fronts the garden gate! So, with that, Jean gueſſed how it was, and he went into the houſe for his gun."</p>
                     <p>"His gun!" exclaimed Emily.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, madam, his gun; and then he came out into the court to watch him, preſently he ſees him come ſlowly down the avenue, and lean over the garden gate, and look up at the houſe for a long time; and I warrant he examined it well, and ſettled what window he ſhould break in at."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="149" facs="unknown:029378_0301_0FE087791BC95B88"/>
"But the gun," ſaid Emily—"the gun!"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, madam, all in good time. Preſently, Jean ſays, the robber opened the gate, and was coming into the court, and then he thought proper to aſk him his buſineſs: ſo he called out again, and bade him ſay who he was, and what he wanted. But the man would do neither; but turned upon his heel, and paſſed into the garden again. Jean knew then well enough how it was, and ſo he fired after him."</p>
                     <p>"Fired!" exclaimed Emily.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, madam, fired off his gun; but, Holy Virgin! <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>hat makes you look ſo pale, madam? The man was not killed,—I dare ſay; but if he was, his comrades carried him off: for when Jean went in the morning, to look for the body, it was gone, and nothing to be ſeen but a track of blood on the ground. Jean followed it, that he might find out where the man got into the garden, but it was loſt in the graſs, and"—</p>
                     <p>Annette was interrupted: for Emily's ſpirits died away, and ſhe would have fallen to the ground, if the girl had not caught her, and ſupported her to a bench, cloſe to them.</p>
                     <p>When, after a long abſence, her ſenſes returned, Emily deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be led to her apartment; and, though ſhe trembled with anxiety to inquire further on the ſubject of her alarm, ſhe found herſelf too ill at preſent, to dare the intelligence which it was poſſible ſhe might receive of Valancourt. Having diſmiſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Annette, that ſhe might weep and think at liberty, ſhe endeavoured to recollect the exact air of the perſon, whom ſhe had ſeen on the terrace, and ſtill her fancy gave her the figure of Valancourt. She had, indeed, ſcarcely a doubt, that it was he whom ſhe had ſeen, and at whom the gardener had fired: for the manner of the latter perſon, as deſcribed by Annette, was not that of a robber<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> nor did it appear probable, that a robber would have come <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>When Emily thought herſelf ſufficiently recovered, to liſten to what Jean might have to relate, ſhe ſent for him; but he could inform her of no circumſtance, that might lead to a knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of the perſon, who had been ſhot, or of the conſequence of the wound; and, after ſeverely reprimanding him, for having fired with bullets, and ordering diligent inquiry to be made in the neighbourhood for the diſcovery of the wounded perſon, ſhe diſmiſſed him, and herſelf remained in the ſame ſtate of terrible ſuſpenſe. All the tenderneſs ſhe had ever felt for Valancourt, was recalled by the ſenſe of his danger; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

was he, who had viſited the gardens, for the purpoſe of ſoothing the miſery of diſappointed affection, amidſt the ſcenes of his former happineſs.</p>
                     <p>"Dear madam," ſaid Annette, when ſhe returned, "I never ſaw you ſo affected before; I dare ſay the man is not killed."</p>
                     <p>Emily ſhuddered, and lamented bitterly the raſhneſs of the gardener in having fired.</p>
                     <p>"I knew you would be angry enough about that, madam, or I ſhould have told you before; and he knew ſo too; for, ſays he, 'Annette, ſay nothing about this to my lady. She lies on the other ſide of the houſe, ſo did not hear the gun, perhaps; but ſhe would be angry with me, if ſhe knew, ſeeing there is blood. But then,' ſays he, 'how is one to keep the garden clear, if one is afraid to fire <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t a robber, when one ſees him?"</p>
                     <p>"No more of this," ſaid Emily, "pray leave me."</p>
                     <p>Annette obeyed, and Emily returned to the agonizing conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erations, that had aſſailed her before, but which ſhe, at length, endeavoured to ſooth by a new remark. If the ſtranger was Valancourt, it was certain he had come alone, and it appeared, therefore, that he had been able to quit the gardens, without aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance; a circumſtance which did not ſeem probable, had his wound been dangerous. With this conſideration, ſhe endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſupport herſelf, during the inquiries, that were making by her ſervants in the neighbourhood; but day after day came, and ſtill cloſed in uncertainty, concerning this affair<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Emily ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in ſilence, at length, drooped, and ſunk under the preſſure of her anxiety. She was attacked by a ſlow fever, and when ſhe yielded to the perſuaſion of Annette to ſend for medical advice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the phyſicians preſcribed little beſide air, gentle excerciſe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſement: but how was this laſt to be obtained? She, however, endeavoured to abſtract her thoughts from the ſubject of her anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety, by employing them in promoting that happineſs in others, which ſhe had loſt herſelf; and, when the evening was fine, ſhe uſually took an airing, including in her ride the cottages of ſome of her tenants, on whoſe condition ſhe made ſuch obſervations, as often enabled her, unaſked, to fulfil their wiſhes.</p>
                     <p>Her indiſpoſition, and the buſineſs ſhe engaged in, relative to this eſtate, had already protracted her ſtay at Tholouſe, beyond the period ſhe had formerly fixed for her departure to La Vallee; and now ſhe was unwilling to leave the only place, where it ſeemed poſſible, that certainty could be obtained on the ſubject of her diſtreſs. But the time was come, when her preſence was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary at La Vallee, a letter from the Lady Blanche now informing
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:029378_0302_0FE08785C3188E88"/>
her, that the Count and herſelf, being then at the chateau of the Baron St. Foix, purpoſed to viſit her at La Vallee, on their way home as ſoon they ſhould be informed of her arrival there. Blanche added, that they made this viſit, with the hope of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing her to return with them to Chateau-le-Blanc.</p>
                     <p>Emily, having replied to the letter of her friend, and ſaid that ſhe ſhould be at La Vallee in a few days, made haſty prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the journey; and, in thus leaving Tholouſe, endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured to ſupport herſelf with a belief, that, if any fatal accident had happened to Valancourt, ſhe muſt in this interval have heard of it.</p>
                     <p>On the evening before her departure, ſhe went to take leave of the terrace and the pavilion. The day had been ſultry, but a light ſhower, that fell juſt before ſunſet, had cooled the air, and given that ſoft verdure to the woods and paſtures, which is ſo refreſhing to the eye; while the rain drops ſtill trembling on the ſhrubs, glittered in the laſt yellow gleam, that lighted up the ſcene, and the air was filled with fragrance, exhaled by the late ſhower from herbs and flowers and from the earth itſelf. But the lovely proſpect, which Emily beheld from the terrace, was no longer viewed by her with delight; ſhe ſighed deeply as her eye wandered over it, and her ſpirits were in a ſtate of ſuch dejection, that ſhe could not think of her approaching return to La Vallee, without tears and ſeemed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to mourn again the death of her father, as if it had been an event of yeſterday.</p>
                     <p>Having reached the pavilion, ſhe ſeated herſelf at the open l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Tears ſtole down her cheek, as the remembrance of what that home had been, returned to her; but, after indulging her ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for ſometime, ſhe checked it, accuſing herſelf of ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in forgetting the friends, that ſhe poſſeſſed, while ſhe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented thoſe that were departed; and ſhe at length, left the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilion and the terrace, without having obſerved a ſhadow of Valancourt or of any other perſon.</p>

                     <p>ON the following morning, Emily left Tholouſe at an early hour, and reached La Vallee about ſunſet. With the melancholy ſhe experienced on the review of a place which had been the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence of her parents, and the ſcene of her earlieſt delight, was mingled, after the firſt ſhock had ſubſided, a tender and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribable pleaſure. For time had ſo far blunted the acuteneſs of her grief, that ſhe now courted every ſcene, that awakened the memory of her friends; in every room, where ſhe had been accuſtomed to ſee them, they almoſt ſeemed to live again; and ſhe felt that La Vallee was ſtill her happieſt home. One of the firſt apartments ſhe viſited, was that, which had been her father's library, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Soon after her arrival, ſhe was ſurpriſed by a viſit from the venerable M. Barreaux, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

She found the old woman within, picking vineſtalks, who on perceiving her young miſtreſs, was nearly overcome with joy.</p>
                     <p>"Ah! my dear young lady!" ſaid ſhe, "I thought I ſhould never ſee you again in this world, when I heard you was gone to that outlandiſh country. I have been hardly uſed, ſince you went; I little thought they would have turned me out of my old maſter's family in my old age!"</p>
                     <p>Emily lamented the circumſtance, and then aſſured her, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>he would make her latter days comfortable, and expreſſed ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfaction, on ſeeing her in ſo pleaſant an habitation.</p>
                     <p>Thereſa thanked her with tears, adding, "Yes, mademoiſelle, it is a very comfortable home, thanks to the kind friend

who took me out of my diſtreſs, when you was too far off to help me, and placed me here! I little thought!—but no more of that—"</p>
                     <p>"And who was this kind friend?" ſaid Emily: "whoever it was, I ſhall conſider him as mine alſo."</p>
                     <p>"Ah mademoiſelle! that friend forbade me to blazon the good deed—I muſt not ſay, who it was. But how you are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered ſince I ſaw you laſt!

                     <p>Emily was affected by this mention of her father, which The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſa obſerving, changed the ſubject. "I heard, mademoiſelle," ſaid ſhe, "that Madame Cheron married a foreign gentleman, after all, and took you abroad how does ſhe do?"</p>
                     <p>Emily now mentioned her death. "Alas!" ſaid Thereſa, "if ſhe had not been my maſter's ſiſter, I ſhould never have loved her; ſhe was always ſo croſs. But how does that dear young gentleman do, M. Valancourt? he was an handſome youth, and a good one; is he well, mademoiſelle?"</p>
                     <p>Emily was much agitated.</p>
                     <p>"A bleſſing on him!" continued Thereſa. Ah, my dear young lady, you need not look ſo ſhy; I know all about it. Do you think that I do not know that he loves you? Why, when you was away, mademoiſelle, he uſed to come to the chateau, and walk about it, ſo diſconſolate! He would go into every room in the lower part of the houſe, and, ſometimes, he would ſit himſelf down in a chair, with his arms acroſs, and his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"It is enough, Thereſa," ſaid Emily.—"How long have you lived in this cottage—and how can I ſerve you? will you remain here, or return and live with me?"</p>
                     <p>"Nay, mademoiſelle!" ſaid Thereſa, "do not be ſo ſhy to your poor old ſervant. I am ſure it is no diſgrace to like ſuch a good young gentleman."</p>

"Ah! how he did love to talk of you! I loved him for that. Nay, for that matter, he liked to hear me talk, for he did not ſay much himſelf. But I ſoon found out what he came to the chateau about. Then, he would go into the garden, and down to the terrace, and ſit under that great tree <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

And he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated your name, and ſighed ſo! and ſaid he had loſt you for ever, for that you would never return for him.

                     <p>"No more of this trifling," ſaid Emily, awakening from her reverie: "it diſpleaſes me."</p>
                     <p>"But when M. Queſnel let the chateau, I thought it would have broke the Chevalier's heart."</p>
                     <p>"Thereſa," ſaid Emily ſeriouſly, "you muſt name the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier no more!"</p>
                     <p>"Not name him, mademoiſelle!" cried Thereſa: "what times are come up now? Why I love the Chevalier next to my old maſter and you, mademoiſelle."</p>
                     <p>"Perhaps your love was not well beſtowed, then," replied Emily, trying to conceal her tears; "but, however that might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

As the road, from the Baron's reſidence to La Vallee, was over ſome of the wildeſt tract of the Pyrenees, and where a carriage wheel had never paſſed, the Count hired mules for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his family, as well as a couple of ſtout guides, who were well armed, informed of all the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ance. The Count, who could not look upon the happineſs, any more than on the miſery of others, with indifference, halted to enjoy this ſcene of ſimple pleaſure. The group before him conſiſted of French and Spaniſh peaſants, the inhabitants of a neighbouring hamlet, ſome of whom were performing a ſprightly dance, the women with caſtanets in their hands, to the ſounds of a lute and a tamborine, till, from the briſk melody of France, the muſic ſoftened into a ſlow move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to which two female peaſants danced a Spaniſh Pavan.</p>
                     <p>The Count, comparing this with the ſcenes of ſuch gaiety a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But the lengthening ſhadows reminded the travellers, that they had no time to loſe; and, leaving this joyous group, they purſued their way towards the little inn, which was to ſhelter them from the night.</p>
                     <p>The rays of the ſetting ſun now threw a yellow gleam upon the foreſts of pine and cheſnut, that ſwept down the lower region of the mountains, and gave reſplendent tints to the ſnowy points above. But ſoon, even this light faded faſt, and the ſcenery aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed a more tremenduous appearance, inveſted with the obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of twilight.

But her enthuſiaſm ſunk into apprehenſion, when, as the ſhadows deepened, ſhe look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the doubtful precipice, that bordered the road, as well as on the various fantaſtic forms of danger, that glimmered through the obſcurity beyond it; and ſhe aſked her father, how far they were from the inn, and whether he did not conſider the

                     <p>To a warm imagination, the dubious forms, that float, half veiled in darkneſs, afford a higher delight, than the moſt diſtinct ſcenery, that the ſun can ſhew. While the fancy thus wanders over landſcapes partly of its own creation, a ſweet complacency ſteals upon the mind, and

The young St. Foix, who ſaw the preſentations of a fervid fancy, and felt whatever enthuſiaſm could ſuggeſt, ſometimes interrupted the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, which the reſt of the party ſeemed by mutual conſent to preſerve, remarking and pointing out to Blanche the moſt ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing effect of the hour upon the ſcenery; while Blanche, whoſe apprehenſions were beguiled by the converſation of her lover, yielded to the taſte ſo congenial to his, and they converſed in a low reſtrained voice, the effect of the penſive tranquillity, which twilight and the ſcene inſpired rather than of any fear that they ſhould be heard. But, while the heart was thus ſoothed to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, St. Foix gradually mingled, with his admiration of the country, a mention of his affection; and he continued to ſpeak, and Blanche to liſten, till the mountains, the woods, and the magical illuſions of twilight were remembered no more.</p>
                     <p>The ſhadows of evening ſoon ſhifted to the gloom of night, which was ſomewhat anticipated by the vapours, that, gathering faſt round the mountains, rolled in dark wreathes along their ſides; and the guides propoſed to reſt, till the moon ſhould riſe, adding, that they thought a ſtorm was coming on. As they looked round for a ſpot, that might afford ſome kind of ſhelter, an object was perceived obſcurely through the duſk, on a point of rock, a little way down the mountain, which they imagined to be a hunter's or a ſhepherd's cabin, and the party, with cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſteps, proceeded towards it. Their labour, however, was not rewarded, or their apprehenſions ſoothed; for, on reaching the object of their ſearch, they diſcovered a monumental croſs, which marked the ſpot to have been polluted by murder.</p>

The chief guide, or rather he, who was the moſt completely armed, drawing forth one of the four piſtols that were tucked into his belt, ſwore, that it had ſho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He then brandiſhed a claſp-knife of enormous length, and was going to recount the wonderful execution it had done, when St. Foix, perceiving, that Blanche was terrified, interrupted him. The Count, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while, ſecretly laughing at the terrible hiſtories and extravagant boaſtings of the man, reſolved to humour him, and, telling Blanche in a whiſper, his deſign, beg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n to recount ſome exploits of his own, which infinitely exceeded any related by the guide.</p>
                     <p>To theſe ſurpriſing circumſtances he ſo artfully gave the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouring of truth, that the courage of the guides was viſibly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by them, who continued ſilent, long after the Count had ceaſed to ſpeak. The loquacity of the chief hero thus laid aſleep, the vigilance of his eyes and ears ſeemed more thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly awakened, for he liſtened with much appearance of anxiety, to the deep thunder, which murmured at intervals, and often pauſed, as the breeze, that was now riſing, ruſhed among the pines. But, when he made a ſudden <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Having now, however, arrived at a level ſpot, ſomewhat ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered from the air, by overhanging cliffs and by a wood of larch, that roſe over a precipice on the left, and the guides being yet ignorant how far they were from the inn, the travellers deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to reſt, till the moon ſhould riſe, or the ſtorm diſperſe. Blanche, recalled, to a ſenſe of the preſent moment, looked on the ſurrounding gloom, with terror; but giving her hand to St. Foix, ſhe alighted, and the whole party entered a kind of cave, if ſuch it could be called, which was only a ſhallow cavity, formed by the curve of impending rocks. A light being ſtruck, a fire was kindled, whoſe blaz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Proviſions being ſpread upon a projection of the rock, the Count and his family partook of a ſupper, which, in a ſcene-leſs rude, would certainly have been thought leſs excellent.
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:029378_0308_0FE087BF250C3508"/>
When the repaſt was finiſhed, St. Foix, impatient for the moon, ſauntered along the precipice, to a point, that fronted the eaſt; but all was yet wrapt in gloom, and the ſilence of night was broken only by the murmuring of woods, that waved far below, or by diſtant thunder, and, now and then, by the faint voices of the party he had quitted. He viewed, with emotions of awful ſublimity, the long volumes of ſulphurous clouds, that floated along the upper and middle regions of the air, and the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, that flaſhed from them, ſometimes ſilently, and, at oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, followed by ſullen peals of thunder, which the mountains feebly prolonged. while the whole horizon, and the abyſs, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> which he ſtood, were diſcovered in the momentary light. Upon the ſucceeding darkneſs, the fire, which had been kindled in the cave, threw a partial gleam, illumining ſome points of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite rocks, and the ſummits of pine woods, that hung beetling on the cliffs below, while their receſſes ſeemed to frown in deeper ſhade.</p>
                     <p>St. Foix ſtopped to obſerve the picture, which the party in the cave preſented, where the elegant form of Blanche was finely contraſted by the majeſtic figure of the Count, who was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>While St. Foix contemplated the ſcene, the moon, broad and yellow, roſe over the eaſtern ſummits, from among embattled clouds, and ſhewed dimly the grandeur of the heavens, the maſs of vapours, that rolled half way down the precipice beneath, and the doubtful mountains.</p>

As the ſtorm however, ſeemed approaching, they did not quit their place of ſhelter; and the Count ſeated between his daughter and St. Foix, endeavoured to divert the fears of the former, and converſed on ſubjects, relating to the natural hiſtory of the ſcene, among which they wandered. He ſpoke of the mineral and foſſile ſubſtances, found in the depths of theſe mountains.—the veins of marble and granite, with which they abounded, the ſtrata of ſhells, diſcovered near their ſummits, many thouſand fathom above the level of the ſea, and at a vaſt diſtance from its preſent ſhore;—of the tremenduous chaſms and caverns of the rocks, the groteſque form of the mountains, and the various phaenomena, that ſeem to ſtamp upon the world the hiſtory of the deluge. From the natural hiſtory he deſcended to the mention events and circumſtances, connected with the civil ſtory of the Pyrenees; named ſome of the moſt remarkable fortreſſes, which France and Spain had erected in the paſſes of theſe mountains; and gave a brief account of ſome cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ebrated ſieges and encounters in early times, when Ambition firſt frightened Solitude from theſe her deep receſſes, made her mountains, which before had echoed only to the torrent's roar, tremble with the clang of arms, and, when man's firſt footſteps in her ſacred haunts had left the print of blood!</p>
                     <p>As Blanche ſat attentive to the narrative, that rendered the ſcenes doubly intereſting, and reſigned to ſolemn emotion, while ſhe conſidered that ſhe was on the very ground, once polluted by theſe events, her reverie was ſuddenly interrupted by a ſound that came in the wind.—It was the diſtant bark of a watch dog. The travellers liſtened with eager hope, and, as the wind blew ſtronger, fancied that the ſound came from no great diſtance; and, the guides having little doubt, that it proceeded from the inn they were in ſearch of, the Count determined to purſue his way. The moon now afforded a ſtronger, though ſtill an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain light as ſhe moved among broken clouds: and the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, led by the ſound, recommenced their journey along the brow of the precipice, preceded by a ſingle torch, that now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the moonlight; for the guides, believing they ſhould reach t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

In ſilent caution they followed the ſound, which was heard but at intervals, and which, after ſome time entirely ceaſed. The guides endeavoured, however, to point their courſe to the quarter, whence it had iſſued, but the deep roaring of a
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:029378_0309_0FE087C3F87118C0"/>
torrent ſoon ſeized their attention, and preſently they came to a tremenduous chaſm of the mountain, which ſeemed to forbid all further progreſs. Blanche alighted from her mule, as did the Count and St. Foix, while the guides traverſed the edge in ſearch of a bridge, which, however rude, might convey them to the oppoſite ſide, and they, at length, confeſſed, what the Count had begun to ſuſpect, that they had been for ſometime doubtful of their way, and were now certain only, that they had loſt it.</p>
                     <p>At a little diſtance, was diſcovered a rude and dangerous paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, formed by an enormous pine, which thrown acroſs the chaſm, united the oppoſite precipices, and which had been felled probably by the hunter, to facilitate his chace of the izard, or the wolf. The whole party, the guides excepted, ſhuddered at the proſpect of croſſing this alpine bridge, whoſe ſides afforded no kind of defence, and from which to fall was to die. The guides, however, prepared to lead over the mules, while Blanche ſtood trembling on the brink, and liſtening to the roar of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which were ſeen deſcending from rocks above, overhung with lofty pines, and thence precipitating themſelves into the deep abyſs, where their white ſurges gleamed faintly in the moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. The poor animals proceeded over this perilous bridge with inſtinctive caution, neither frightened by the noiſe of the cataract, or deceived by the gloom, which the impending foli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age threw athwart their way. It was now, that the ſolitary torch, which had been hitherto of little ſervice, was found to be an ineſtimable treaſure; and Blanche, terrified, ſhrinking, but endeavouring to recollect all her firmneſs and preſence of mind, preceded by her lover and ſupported by her father, followed the red gleam of the torch, in ſafety, to the oppoſite cliff.</p>
                     <p>As they went on, the heights contracted, and formed a narrow paſs at the bottom of which, the torrent they had juſt croſſed, was heard to thunder. But they were again cheered by the bark of a dog, keeping watch, perhaps, over the flocks of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, to protect them from the nightly deſcent of the wolves. The ſound was much nearer than before, and, while they rejoiced in the hope of ſoon reaching a place of repoſe, a light was ſeen to glimmer at a diſtance. It appeared at a height conſiderably above the level of their path, and was loſt and ſeen again, as if the waving branches of trees ſometimes excluded and then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted its rays. The guides hallowed with all their ſtrength, but the ſound of no human voice was heard in return, and, at length, as a more effectual means of making themſelves known, they fired a piſtol. But, while they liſtened in anxious expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:029378_0309_0FE087C3F87118C0"/>
the noiſe of the exploſion was alone heard, echoing among the rocks, and it gradually ſunk into a ſilence, which no friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hint of man diſturbed. The light, however, that had been ſeen before, now became plainer, and, ſoon after, voices were heard indiſtinctly on the wind; but, upon the guides repeating the call, the voices ſuddenly ceaſed, and the light diſappeared.</p>
                     <p>The Lady Blanche was now almoſt ſinking beneath the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of anxiety, fatigue and apprehenſion, and the united efforts of the Count and St. Foix could ſcarcely ſupport her ſpirits. As they continued to advance, an object was perceived on a point of rock above, which the ſtrong rays of the moon then falling on it, appeared to be a watch tower. The Count, from its ſituation and ſome other circumſtances, had little doubt that it was ſuch, and believing, that the light had proceeded from thence, he endeavoured to reanimate his daughter's ſpirits by the near proſpect of ſhelter and repoſe, which, however rude the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, a ruined watch tower might afford.</p>
                     <p>"Numerous watch towers have been erected among the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renees," ſaid the Count, anxious only to call Blanche's atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the ſubject of her fears; "and the method by which they give intelligence of the approach of the enemy, is, you know, by fires, kindled on the ſummits of theſe edifices. Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals have thus, ſometimes, been communicated from poſt to poſt along a frontier line of ſeveral hundred miles in length. Then, as occaſion may require, the lurking armies emerge from their fortreſſes and the foreſts, and march forth to defend, perhaps, the entrance of ſome grand paſs, where, planting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the heights, they aſſail their aſtoniſhed enemies, who wind along the glen below, with fragments of the ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered cliff, and pour death and defeat upon them. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient forts, and watch towers, overlooking the grand paſſes of the Pyrenees, are carefully preſerved; but ſome of thoſe in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior ſtations have been ſuffered to fall into decay, and are now frequently converted into the more peaceful habitation of the hunter, or the ſhepherd, who after a day of to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>"But are they always thus peacefully inhabited?" ſaid the Lady Blanche.</p>
                     <p>"No," replied the Count, "they are ſometimes the aſylum of French and Spaniſh ſmugglers, who croſs the mountains with contraband goods from their reſpective countries, and the latter

are particularly numerous, againſt whom ſtrong parties of the king's troops are ſometimes ſent. But the deſperate reſolution of theſe adventurers, who, knowing, that, if they are taken, they muſt expiate the breach of the law by the moſt cruel death, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel in large parties, well armed, often daunts the courage of the ſoldiers. The ſmugglers, who ſeek only ſafety, never engage, when they can poſſibly avoid it; the military, alſo, who know, that in theſe encounters, danger is certain, and glory almoſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attainable, are equally reluctant to fight; an engagement, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, very ſeldom happens, but, when it does, it never concludes till after the moſt deſperate and bloody conflict. You are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attentive, Blanche," added the Count; "I have wearied you with a dull ſubject; but ſee, yonder, in the moonlight, is the edifice we have been in ſearch of, and we are fortunate to be ſo near it, before the ſtorm burſts."</p>
                     <p>Blanche, looking up, perceived that they were at the foot of the cliff, on whoſe ſummit the building ſtood, but no light now iſſued from it; the barking of the dog too had, for ſometime, ceaſed, and the guides began to doubt, whether this was really the object of their ſearch. From the diſtance, at which they ſurveyed it, ſhewn imperfectly by a cloudy moon, it appeared to be of more extent than a ſingle watch tower; but the difficulty was how to aſcend the height, whoſe abrupt declivities ſeemed to afford no kind of path way.</p>
                     <p>While the guides carried forward the torch to examine the cliff, the Count, remaining with Blanche and St. Foix at its foot, under the ſhadow of the woods, endeavoured again to beguile the time by converſation, but again anxiety abſtracted the mind of Blanche; and he then conſulted, apart with St. Foix, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it would be adviſable, ſhould a path be found, to venture to an edifice, which might poſſibly harbour banditti. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that their own party was not ſmall, and that ſeveral of them were well armed; and, after enumerating the dangers, to be incurred by paſſing the night in the open wild, expoſed, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, to the effects of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> ſtorm, there remained not a doubt, that they ought to endeavour to obtain admittance to the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice above, at any hazard reſpecting the inhabitants it might harbour; but the darkneſs and the dead ſilence, that ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, appeared to contradict the probability of its being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited at all.</p>
                     <p>A ſhout from the guides arouſed their attention, after which, in a few minutes, one of the Count's ſervants returned with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, that a path was found, and they immediately haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:029378_0310_0FE087D26251A118"/>
to join the guides, when they all aſcended a little winding way cut in the rock among thickets of dwarf wood, and, after much toil and ſome danger, reached the ſummit, where ſeveral ruined towers, ſurrounded by a maſſy wall, roſe to their view, partially illumined by the moonlight. The ſpace around the building was ſilent, and apparently forſaken, but the Count was cautious; "Step ſoftly," ſaid he, in a low voice, "while we reconnoitre the edifice."</p>
                     <p>Having proceeded ſilently along for ſome paces, they ſtopped at a gate, whoſe portals were terrible even in ruins, and, after a moment's heſitation, paſſed on to the court of entrance, but pauſed again at the head of a terrace, which, branching from it, ran along the brow of a precipice. Over this, roſe the main body of the edifice, which was now ſeen to be, not a watch tower, but one of thoſe ancient fortreſſes, that, from age and neglect, had fallen to decay. Many parts of it, however, appeared to be ſtill entire; it was built of grey ſtone, in the heavy Saxon-gothic ſtyle, with enormous round towers, buttreſſes of proportionable ſtrength, and the arch of the large gate, which ſeemed to open into the hall of the fabric, was round, as was that of a window above. The air of ſolemnity, which muſt ſo ſtrongly have characterized the pile even in the days of its early ſtrength, was now conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erably heightened by its ſhattered battlements and half demoliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed walls, and by the huge maſſes of ruin, ſcattered in its wide area, now ſilent and graſs grown. In this court of entrance ſtood the gigantic remains of an oak, that ſeemed to have flouriſhed and decayed with the building, which it ſtill appeared frowning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to protect by the few remaining branches, leafleſs and moſs grown, that crowned its trunk, and whoſe wide extent told how enormous the tree had been in a former age. This fortreſs was evidently once of great ſtrength, and, from its ſituation on a point of rock, impending over a deep glen, had been of great power to annoy, as well as to reſiſt; the Count, therefore, as he ſtood ſurveying it, was ſomewhat ſurpriſed, that it had been ſuffered, ancient as it was, to ſink into ruins, and its preſent lonely and deſerted air excited in his breaſt emotions of melancholy awe. While he indulged, for a moment, theſe emotions, he thought he heard a ſound of remote voices ſteal upon the ſtillneſs, from within the building, the front of which he again ſurveyed with ſcrutinizing eyes, but yet no light was viſible. He now deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to walk round the fort, to that remote part of it, whence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e thought the voices had ariſen, that he might examine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any light could be diſcerned there, before he ventured to
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:029378_0311_0FE087D6FB33C300"/>
knock at the gate; for this purpoſe, he entered upon the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race, where the remains of cannon were yet apparent in the thick walls, but he had not proceeded many paces when his ſteps were ſuddenly arreſted by the loud barking of a dog with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and which he fancied to be the ſame, whoſe voice had been the means of bringing the travellers thither. It now appeared certain, that the place was inhabited, and the Count returned to conſult again with St. Foix, whether he ſhould try to obtain admittance, for its wild aſpect had ſomewhat ſhaken his former reſolution; but, after a ſecond conſultation, he ſubmitted to the conſiderations, which before determined him, and which were ſtrengthened by the diſcovery of the dog, that guarded the fort, as well as by the ſtillneſs that pervaded it. He therefore, ordered one of his ſervants to knock at the gate, who was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing to obey him, when a light appeared through the loop hole of one of the towers, and the Count called loudly, but, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving no anſwer, he went up to the gate himſelf, and ſtruck up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it with an iron pointed pole, which had aſſiſted him to climb the ſteep. When the echoes had ceaſed, that this blow had awakened the renewed barking, and there were now more than one dog,—was the only ſound, that was heard. The Count ſtepped back, a few paces, to obſerve whether the light was in the tower, and, perceiving, that it was gone, he returned to the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and had lifted the pole to ſtrike again, when again he fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied he heard the murmur of voices within, and pauſed to liſten. He was confirmed in the ſuppoſition, but they were too remote, to be heard otherwiſe than in a murmur, and the Count now let the pole fall heavily upon the gate; when almoſt immediately a profound ſilence followed. It was apparent, that the people within had heard the ſound, and their caution in admitting ſtrangers gave him a favourable opinion of them. "They are either hunters or ſhepherds," ſaid he "who like ourſelves, have proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſought ſhelter from the night within theſe walls, and are fearful of admitting ſtrangers, leſt they ſhould prove robbers. I will endeavour to remove their fears." So ſaying, he called aloud, "We are friends, who aſk ſhelter from the night." In a few moments, ſteps were heard within, which approached, and a voice then inquired—"Who calls?" "Friends," repeated the Count; "open the gates and you ſhall know more." Strong bolts were now heard to be undrawn, and a man, armed with a hunting ſpear, appeared. "What is it you want at this hour?" ſaid he. The Count beckoned his attendants, and then anſwered, that he wiſhed to inquire the way to the neareſt cabin. "Are
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:029378_0311_0FE087D6FB33C300"/>
you ſo little acquainted with theſe mountains," ſaid the man, "as not to know, that there is none, within ſeveral leagues? I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſhew you the way; you muſt ſeek it—there is a moon." Saying this, he was cloſing the gate, and the Count was turning away, half diſappointed and half afraid, when another voice was heard from above, and, on looking up, he ſaw a light, and a man's face, at the grate of the portal. "Stay, friend, you have loſt your way?" ſaid the voice. "You are hunters, I ſuppoſe, lik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> ourſelves: I will be with you preſently." The voice ceaſed, and the light diſappeared. Blanche had been alarmed by the appearance of the man, who had opened the gate, and ſhe now entreated her father to quit the place; but the Count had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the hunter's ſpear, which he carried; and the words from the tower encouraged him to await the event. The gate was ſoon opened, and ſeveral men in hunters' habits, who had heard above what had paſſed below, appeared, and, having liſtened ſometime to the Count, told him he was welcome to reſt there for the night. They then preſſed him with much courteſy, to enter, and to partake of ſuch fare as they were about to ſit down to. The Count, who had obſerved them attentively while they ſpoke, was cautious, and ſomewhat ſuſpicious; but he was alſo weary, fearful of the approaching ſtorm, and of encountering al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine heights in the obſcurity of night; being likewiſe ſomewhat confident in the ſtrength and number of his attendants, he, after ſome further conſideration, determined to accept the invitation. With this reſolution he called his ſervants, who, advancing round the tower, behind which ſome of them had ſilently liſtened to this conference, followed their Lord, the Lady Blanche, and St. Foix into the fortreſs. The ſtrangers led them on to a large and rude hall, partially ſeen by a fire, that blazed at its extremity, round which four men, in the hunter's dreſs, were ſeated, and on the hearth were ſeveral dogs ſtretched in ſleep. In the middle of the hall ſtood a large table, and over the fire ſome part of an animal was boiling. As the Count approached, the men aroſe, and the dogs, half raiſing themſelves, looked fiercely at the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, but, on hearing their maſters' voices, kept their poſtures on the hearth.</p>
                     <p>Blanche looked round this gloomy and ſpacious hall; then at the men, and to her father, who, ſmiling cheerfully at her, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed himſelf to the hunters. "This is an hoſpitable hearth," ſaid he, "the blaze of a fire is reviving after having wandered ſo long in theſe dreary wilds. Your dogs are tired; what ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs have you had?" "Such as we uſually have," replied one

of the men, who had been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

"Theſe are fellow hunters," ſaid one of the men who had brought the Count hither, "that have loſt their way, and I have told them there is room enough in the fort for us all." "Very true, very true" replied his companion, "What luck have you had in the chace, brothers? We have killed two izards, and that you will ſay is pretty well." "You miſtake, friend," ſaid the Count, "we are not hunters, but tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers; but, if you will admit us to hunters' fare, we ſhall be well contented, and will repay your kindneſs." "Sit down then, brother," ſaid one of the men: "Jacques, lay more fuel on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>"You lead a jolly life here," ſaid the Count. "The life of a hunter is a pleaſant and a healthy one; and the repoſe is ſweet, which ſucceeds to your labour."</p>
                     <p>"Yes," replied one of his hoſts, "our life is pleaſant enough. We live here only during the ſummer, and autumnal months; in winter, the plac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>"'Tis a life of liberty and enjoyment," ſaid the Count: "I ſhould like to paſs a month in your way very well."</p>
                     <p>"We find employment for our guns too," ſaid a man who ſtood behind the Count: "here are plenty of birds, of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious flavour, that feed upon the wild thyme and herbs, that grow in the vallies. Now I think of it, there is a brace of birds hung up in the ſtone gallery; go fetch them, Jacques, we will have them dreſſed."</p>
                     <p>The Count now made inquiry, concerning the method of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing the chace among the rocks and precipices of theſe romantic regions, and was liſtening to a curious detail, when a horn was ſounded at the gate. Blanche looked timidly at her father, who continued to converſe on the ſubject of the chace, but whoſe countenance was ſomewhat expreſſive of anxiety, and who often turned his eyes towards that part of the hall neareſt the gate. The horn founded again, and a loud halloo ſucceeded. "Theſe
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:029378_0312_0FE087E1AE9AA230"/>
are ſome of our companions, returned from their day's labour," ſaid a man, going lazily from his ſeat towards the gate; and in a few minutes, two men appeared, each with a gun over his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and piſtols in his belt. "What cheer, my lads? what cheer?" ſaid they, as they approached. "What luck?" return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their companions: "have you brought home your ſupper? You ſhall have none elſe."</p>
                     <p>"Hah! who the devil have you brought home?" ſaid they in bad Spaniſh, on perceiving the Count's party, "are they from France, or Spain?—where did you meet with them?"</p>
                     <p>"They met with us, and a merry meeting too," replied his companion aloud in good French. "This chevalier, and his party, had loſt their way, and aſked a night's lodging in the fort." The others made no reply, but threw down a kind of knapſack, and drew forth ſeveral brace of birds. The bag ſounded heavily as it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ell to the ground, and the glitter of ſome bright metal within, glanced on the eye of the Count, who now ſurveyed, with a more inquiring look, the man that held the knapſack. He was a tall robuſt figure, of a hard counten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and had ſhort black hair, curling in his neck. Inſtead of the hunter's dreſs, he wore a faded military uniform; ſandals were laced on his broad legs, and a kind of ſhort trowſers hung from his waiſt. On his head he wore a leathern cap, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what reſembling in ſhape an ancient Roman helmet; but the brows that ſcowled beneath it, would have characterized thoſe of the barbarians, who conquered Rome, rather than thoſe of a Roman ſoldier. The Count, at length, turned away his eyes, and remained ſilent and thoughtful, till, again raiſing them, he perceived a figure ſtanding in an obſcure part of the hall, fixed in attentive gaze on St. Foix, who was converſing with Blanche, and did not obſerve this; but the Count, ſoon after, ſaw the ſame man, looking over the ſhoulder of the ſoldier as atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively at himſelf. He withd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rw his eye, when that of the Count met it, who felt miſtruſt gathering faſt upon his mind, but feared to betray it in his countenance, and, forcing his fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to aſſume a ſmile, addreſſed Blanche on ſome indifferent ſubject. When he again looked round, he perceived, that the ſoldier and his companion were gone.</p>
                     <p>The man, who was called Jacques, now returned from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>His companions approved of the removal, and invited their gueſts to follow to the gallery, of whom Blanche appeared diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed,
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:029378_0313_0FE087E797B346A8"/>
and remained ſeated, and St. Foix looked at the Count, who ſaid, he preferred the comfortable blaze of the fire he was then near. The hunters, however, commended the warmth of the other apartment, and preſſed his removal with ſuch ſeeming courteſy, that the Count, half doubting, and half fearful of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying his doubts, conſented to go. The long and ruinous paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, through which they went, ſomewhat daunted him, but the thunder, which now burſt in loud peals above, made it dangerous to quit this place of ſhelter, and he forbore to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke his conductors by ſhewing that he diſtruſted them. The hunters led the way, with a lamp; the Count and St. Foix, who wiſhed to pleaſe their hoſts by ſome inſtances of familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, carried each a ſeat, and Blanche followed, with faltering ſteps. As ſhe paſſed on, part of her dreſs caught on a nail in the wall, and, while ſhe ſtopped, ſomewhat too ſcrupulouſly, to diſengage it, the Count, who was talking to St. Foix, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of whom obſerved the circumſtance, followed their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor round an abrupt angle of the paſſage, and Blanche was left behind in darkneſs. The thunder prevented them from hearing her call, but, having diſengaged her dreſs, ſhe quickly followed, as ſhe thought, the way they had taken. A light that glimmered at a diſtance, confirmed this belief, and ſhe proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards an open door, whence it iſſued, conjecturing the room beyond to be the ſtone gallery the men had ſpoken of. Hearing voices as ſhe advanced, ſhe pauſed within a few pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the chamber, that ſhe might be certain whether ſhe was right, and from thence, by the light of a lamp, that hung from the ceiling, obſerved four men, ſeated round a table, over which they leaned in apparent conſultation. In one of them ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed the features of him, whom ſhe had obſerved, gazing at St. Foix, with ſuch deep attention; and who was now ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in an earneſt, though reſtrained voice, till, one of his compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions ſeeming to oppoſe him, they ſpoke together in a loud and harſher tone. Blanche, alarmed by perceiving, that neither her father, or St. Foix were there, and terrified at the fierce counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and manners of theſe men, was turning haſtily from the chamber, to purſue her ſearch of the gallery, when ſhe heard one of the men ſay:</p>
                     <p>"Let all diſpute end here. Who talks of danger? Follow my advice, and there will be none—ſecure <hi>them,</hi> and the reſt are an eaſy prey." Blanche, ſtruck with theſe words, pauſed a mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I can help it—diſpatch the two others, and our buſineſs is done, the reſt may go."</p>
                     <p>"May they ſo," exclaimed the firſt ruffian, with a tremendu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous oath—"What! to tell how we have diſpoſed of their maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and to ſend the kings troops to drag us to the wheel! You was always a choice adviſer—I warrant we have not yet forgot St. Thomas's eve laſt year."</p>
                     <p>Blanche's heart now ſunk with horror. Her firſt impulſe was to retreat from the door, but, when ſhe would have gone, her trembling frame refuſed to ſupport her, and having tottered a few paces, to a more obſcure part of the paſſage, ſhe was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to liſten to the dreadful councils of thoſe, who ſhe was no longer ſuffered to doubt, were banditti. In the next moment, ſhe heard the following words, "Why you would not murder the whole <hi>gang?</hi>"</p>
                     <p>"I warrant our lives are as good as theirs," replied his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p>"Better, better," cried his comrades.</p>
                     <p>"To commit murder is a hopeful way of eſcaping the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows!" ſaid the firſt ruffian—"many an honeſt fellow has run his head into the nooſe that way, though." There was a pauſe of ſome moments, during which they appeared to be conſidering.</p>
                     <p>"Confound thoſe fellows," exclaimed one of the robbers im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently, "they ought to have been here by this time; they will come back preſently with the old ſtory, and no booty: if they were here, our buſineſs would be plain and eaſy. I ſee we ſhall not be able to do the buſineſs to night, for our numbers are not equal to the enemy, and in the morning they will be for marching off, and how can we detain them without force?"</p>
                     <p>"I have been thinking of a ſcheme, that will do," ſaid one of his comrades; "if we can diſpatch the two chevaliers ſilent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it will be eaſy to maſter the reſt."</p>
                     <p>"That's a plauſible ſcheme, in good faith," ſaid another with a ſmile of ſcorn—"If I can eat my way through the priſon wall, I ſhall be at liberty!—How can we diſpatch them <hi>ſilently?</hi>"</p>
                     <p>"By poiſon," replied his companions.</p>

                     <p>"But how are we to manage this buſineſs?" ſaid the ſecond ruffian: "let us talk of that, there is no fear of there being booty enough, but how are we to ſecure it?"</p>
                     <p>"Aye, aye," ſaid his comrades, "let us talk of that, and remember no time is to be loſt."</p>

                     <p>Blanche, who had liſtened to this converſation, in an agony, which it would be impoſſible to deſcribe, could no longer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh what was ſaid, for the ruffians now ſpoke in lowered voices; but the hope, that ſhe might ſave her friends from the plot, if ſhe could find her way quickly to them, ſuddenly reani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated her ſpirits, and lent her ſtrength enough to turn her ſteps in ſearch of the gallery. Terror, however, and darkneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired againſt her, and, having moved a few yards, the feeble light, that iſſued from the chamber, no longer even contended with the gloom, and, her foot ſtumbling over a ſtep that croſſed the paſſage, ſhe fell to the ground.</p>
                     <p>The noiſe ſtartled the banditti, who became ſuddenly ſilent, and then all ruſhed to the paſſage, to examine whether any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was there, who might have overheard their councils. Blanche ſaw them approaching, and perceived their fierce and eager looks: but, before ſhe could raiſe herſelf, they diſcovered and ſeized her, and, as they dragged her towards the chamber they had quitted, her ſcreams drew from them horrible threatenings.</p>
                     <p>Having reached the room, they began to conſult what they ſhould do with her. "Let us firſt know what ſhe has heard," ſaid the chief robber. "How long have you been in the paſſage, lady, and what brought you there?"</p>
                     <p>"Let us firſt ſecure that picture," ſaid one of his comrades, approaching the trembling Blanche. "Fair lady, by your leave that picture is mine; come, ſurrender it, or I ſhall ſeize it."</p>
                     <p>Blanche, entreating their mercy, immediately gave up the miniature, while another of the ruffians fiercely interrogated her, concerning what ſhe had overheard of their converſation, when, her confuſion and terror too plainly telling what her tongue feared to confeſs, the ruffians looked expreſſively upon one another, and two of them withdrew to a remote part of the room, as if to conſult further.</p>
                     <p>"Theſe are diamonds by St. Peter!" exclaimed the fellow, who had been examining the miniature, "and here is a very pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty picture too, faith; as handſome a young chevalier, as you would wiſh to ſee by a ſummer's ſun. Lady, this is your ſpouſe, I warrant, for it is the ſpark, that was in your company juſt now."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="176" facs="unknown:029378_0315_0FE087FB1034DD60"/>
Blanche, ſinking with terror, conjured him to have pity on her, and, delivering him her purſe, promiſed to ſay nothing of what had paſſed, if he would ſuffer her to return to her friends.</p>
                     <p>He ſmiled ironically, and was going to reply, when his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was called off by a diſtant noiſe; and, while he liſtened, he graſped the arm of Blanche more firmly, as if he feared ſhe would eſcape from him, and ſhe again ſhrieked for help.</p>
                     <p>The approaching ſounds called the ruffians from the other part of the chamber. "We are betrayed," ſaid they; "but let us liſten a moment, perhaps it is only our comrades come in from the mountains, and if ſo, our work is ſure; liſten!"</p>
                     <p>A diſtant diſcharge of ſhot confirmed this ſuppoſition for a moment, but, in the next, the former ſounds drawing nearer, the claſhing of ſwords, mingled with voices of loud contention, and with heavy groans, were diſtinguiſhed in the avenue leading to the chamber. While the ruffians prepare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, it appeared, they too well underſtood; for three of them, leaving the Lady Blanche to the care of the fourth, inſtantly ruſhed from the chamber.</p>
                     <p>While Blanche, trembling, and nearly fainting, was ſupplicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for releaſe, ſhe heard amid the tumult, that approached, the voice of St. Foix, and ſhe had ſcarcely renewed her ſhriek, when the door of the room was thrown open, and he appeared, much disfigured with blood, and purſued by ſeveral ruffians. Blanche neither ſaw or heard any more; her head ſwam, her ſight failed, and ſhe became ſenſeleſs in the arms of the robber, who had detained her.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe recovered, ſhe perceived, by the gloomy light, that trembled round her, that ſhe was in the ſame chamber, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Count, St. Foix or any other perſon appeared, and ſhe continued for ſometime entirely ſtill, and nearly in a ſtate of ſtupefaction. But, the dreadful images of the paſt returning, ſhe endeavoured to raiſe herſelf, that ſhe might ſeek her friends, when a ſullen groan, at a little diſtance, reminded her of St. Foix, and of the condition, in which ſhe had ſeen him enter this room; then, ſtarting from the floor, by a ſudden effort of horror, ſhe advanced to the place whence the ſound had proceeded, where a body was lying ſtretched upon the pavement, and where, by the glimmering light of a lamp, ſhe diſcovered the pale and disfigured countenance of St. Foix. Her horrors, at that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may be eaſily imagined. He was ſpeechleſs; his eyes
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:029378_0315_0FE087FB1034DD60"/>
were half cloſed, and, on the hand, which ſhe graſped in the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony of deſpair, cold damps had ſettled. While ſhe vainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated his name, and called for aſſiſtance, ſteps approached, and a perſon entered the chamber, who, ſhe ſoon perceived was not the Count, her father; but, what was her aſtoniſhment, when ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating him to give his aſſiſtance to St. Foix, ſhe diſcovered Ludovico! He ſcarcely pauſed to recogniſe her, but immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bound up the wounds of the Chevalier, and, perceiving, that he had fainted probably from loſs of blood, ran for water; but he had been abſent only a few moments, when Blanche heard other ſteps approaching, and, while ſhe was almoſt frantic with apprehenſion of the ruffians, the light of a torch flaſhed upon the walls, and then, Count De Villefort appeared, with an affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed countenance, and breathleſs with impatience, calling upon his daughter. At the ſound of his voice, ſhe roſe, and ran to his arms, while he, letting fall the bloody ſword he held, preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to his boſom in a tranſport of gratitude and joy, and then haſtily inquired for St. Foix, who now gave ſome ſigns of life. Ludovico ſoon after returning with water and brandy, the former was applied to his lips, and the latter to his temples and hands, and Blanche, at length, ſaw him uncloſe his eyes, and then heard him inquire for her; but the joy ſhe felt, on this occaſion, was interrupted by new alarms, when Ludovico ſaid it would be neceſſary to remove Monſ. St. Foix immediately, and added, "The banditti, that are out, my Lord, were expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed home, an hour ago, and they will certainly find us, if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay. That ſhrill horn, they know, is never ſounded by their comrades but on moſt deſperate occaſions, and it echoes among the mountains for many leagues round. I have known them brought home by its ſound even from the Pied de Melicant. Is any body ſtanding watch at the great gate, my Lord?"</p>
                     <p>"Nobody," replied the Count; "the reſt of my people are now ſcattered about I ſcarcely know where. Go, Ludovico, collect them together, and look out yourſelf, and liſten if you hear the feet of mules."</p>
                     <p>Ludovico then hurried away and the Count conſulted as to the means of removing St. Foix, who could not have borne the motion of a mule, even if his ſtrength would have ſupported him in the ſaddle.</p>
                     <p>While the Count was telling, that the banditti, whom they had found in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

entirely uſeleſs; but he ſmiled at her anxiety, aſſuring her the wound was trifling.</p>
                     <p>The Count's ſervants, except two who kept watch at the gate, now appeared, and, ſoon after<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ludovico. "I think I hear mules coming along the glen, my Lord," ſaid he, "but the roaring of the torrent below will not let me be certain; however, I have brought what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ill ſerve the Chevalier," he added, ſhewing a bear's ſkin faſtened to a couple of long poles, which had been adapted for the purpoſe of bringing home ſuch of the banditti as happened to be wounded in their encounters. Ludovico ſpread it on the ground, and, placing the ſkins of ſeveral goats upon it, made a kind of bed, into which the Chevalier, who was howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver now much revived, was gently lifted; and, the poles being raiſed upon the ſhoulders of the guides, whoſe footing among theſe ſteeps could beſt be depended upon, he was borne along with an eaſy motion. Some of the Count's ſervants were alſo wounded—but not materially, and, their wounds being bound up, they now followed to the great gate. As they paſſed along the hall, a loud tumult was heard at ſome diſtance, and Blanche was terrified. "It is only thoſe villains in the dungeon, my Lady." ſaid Ludovico. "They ſeem to be burſting it open," ſaid the Count. "No, my Lord," replied Ludovico, "it has an iron door; we have nothing to fear from them; but let me go firſt, and look out from the rampart."</p>
                     <p>They quickly followed him, and ſound their mules browſing before the gates, where the party liſtened anxiouſly, but heard no ſound, except that of the torrent below and of the early breeze, ſighing among the branches of the old oak, that grew in the court; and they were now glad to perceive the firſt tints of dawn over the mountain tops. When they had mounted their mules, Ludovico undertaking to be their guide, led them by an eaſier path, than that by which they had formerly aſcended, into the glen. "We muſt avoid that valley to the eaſt, my Lord," ſaid he, "or we may meet the banditti; they went out that way in the morning."</p>
                     <p>The travellers, ſoon after, quitted this glen, and found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a narrow <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The morning light upon the mountains now ſtrengthened faſt, and gradually diſcovered the green hillocks, that ſkirted the winding feet of the cliffs, tufted with cork tree, and ever-green oak. The thunder clouds being diſperſed, had left the ſky per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſerene, and Blanche was revived by the freſh breeze, and by the view of verdure, which, the late rain had brightened.

Soon after, the ſun aroſe, when the dripping rocks, with the ſhrubs that fringed their ſummits, and many a turfy ſlope be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, ſparkled in his rays. A wreath of miſt was ſeen, floating along the extremity of the valley, but the gale bore it before the travellers, and the ſunbeams gradually drew it up towards the ſummit of the mountains. They had proceeded about a league, when St. Foix having complained of extreme faintneſs, they ſtopped to give him refreſhment, and, that the men who bore him, might reſt. Ludovico had brought from the fort ſome flaſks of rich Spaniſh wine, which now proved a reviving cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial not only to St. Foix but to the whole party, though to him it gave only temporary relief, for it fed the fever that burned in his veins, and he could neither diſguiſe in his countenance the anguiſh he ſuffered, or ſuppreſs the wiſh, that he was arrived at the inn, where they had deſigned to paſs the preceding night.</p>
                     <p>While they thus repoſed themſelves under the ſhade of the dark green pines, the Count deſired Ludovico to explain ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by what means he had diſappeared from the north apartment, how he came into the hands of the banditti, and how he had contributed ſo eſſentia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>EMILY, meanwhile, was ſtill ſuffering anxiety as to the fate of Valancourt; but Thereſa, having, at length, found a perſon, whom ſhe could entruſt on her errand to the ſteward, informed her, that the meſſenger would return on the following day; and Emily promiſed to be at the cottage, Thereſa being too lame to attend her.</p>
                     <p>In the evening, therefore, Emily ſet out alone for the cottage, with a melancholy foreboding, concerning Valancourt, while, perhaps, the gloom of the hour might contribute to depreſs her ſpirits. It was a grey autumnal evening towards the cloſe of the

ſeaſon; heavy miſts partially obſcured the mountains, and a chill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing breeze, that ſighed among the beech woods, ſtrewed her path with ſome of their laſt yellow leaves. Theſe circling in the blaſt and foretelling the death of the year, gave an image of deſolation to her mind, and, in her fancy, ſeemed to announce the death of Valancourt. Of this ſhe had, indeed, more than once ſo ſtrong a preſentiment, that ſhe was on the point of returning home, feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herſelf unequal to an encounter with the certainty ſhe anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipated, but, contending with her emotions, ſhe ſo far command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, as to be able to proceed.</p>
                     <p>While ſhe walked mournfully on, gazing on the long volumes of vapour, that poured upon the ſky, and watching the ſwallows toſſed along the wind, now diſappearing among tempeſtuous clouds, and then emerging for a moment, in circles upon the calmer air, the afflictions and viciſſitudes of her late life ſeemed pourtrayed in theſe fleeting images;—thus had ſhe been toſſed upon the ſtormy ſea of misfortune for the laſt year, with but ſhort intervals of peace, if peace that could be called, which was only the delay of evils. And now, when ſhe had eſcaped from ſo many dangers, was become independent of the will of thoſe, who had oppreſſed her, and found herſelf miſtreſs of a large for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, now, when ſhe might reaſonably have expected happineſs, ſhe perceived that ſhe was as diſtant from it as ever. She would have accuſed herſelf of weakneſs and ingratitude in thus ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſenſe of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

This fear increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the means of certainty concerning it approached; and, when ſhe came within view of Thereſa's cottage, ſhe was ſo much diſordered, and her reſolution ſailed her ſo entirely, that, unable to proceed, ſhe reſted on a bank, beſide her path; where, as ſhe ſat, the wind that groaned ſullenly among the lofty branches above, ſeemed to her melancholy imagination to bear the ſounds of diſtant lamentation, and, in the pauſes of the guſt, ſhe ſtill fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied, ſhe heard the feeble and far off notes of diſtreſs. Attention
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:029378_0317_0FE0698C52C3B218"/>
convinced her, that this was no more than fancy; but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing gloom, which ſeemed the ſudden cloſe of day, ſoon warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to depart, and, with faltering ſteps, ſhe again moved to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the cottage. Through the caſement appeared the cheerful blaze of a wood fire, and Thereſa, who had obſerved Emily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, was already at the door to receive her.</p>
                     <p>"It is a cold evening, madam," ſaid ſhe, "ſtorms are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, and I thought you would like a fire. Do take this chair by the hearth."</p>
                     <p>Emily, thanking her for this conſideration, ſat down, and then, looking in her face, on which the wood fire threw a gleam, ſhe was ſtruck with its expreſſion, and, unable to ſpeak, ſunk back in her chair with a countenance ſo full of woe, that Thereſa in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly comprehended the occaſion of it, but ſhe remained ſilent. "Ah!" ſaid Emily, at length, "it is unneceſſary for me to aſk the reſult of your inquiry, your ſilence, and that look, ſufficiently explain it;—he is dead!"</p>
                     <p>"Alas! my dear young lady," replied Thereſa, while tears filled her eyes, "this world is made up with trouble! the rich have their ſhare as well as the poor! But we muſt all endeavour to bear what Heaven pleaſes."</p>
                     <p>"He is dead then!" interrupted Emily, "Valancourt is dead!"</p>
                     <p>"A-well-a-day! I fear he is," replied Thereſa.</p>
                     <p>"You fear!" ſaid Emily, "do you only fear?"</p>
                     <p>"Alas! yes, Madam, I fear he is! neither the ſteward, or any of the Epourville family, have heard of him ſince he left Languedoc, and the Count is in great affliction about him, for he ſays he was always punctual in writing, but that now he has not received a line from him, ſince he left Languedoc; he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be at home, three weeks ago, but he has neither come, or written, and they fear ſome accident has befallen him. Alas! that ever I ſhould live to cry for his death,! I am old, and might have died without being miſſed, but he"—Emily was faint, and aſked for ſome water, and Thereſa, alarmed by the voice, in which ſhe ſpoke, haſtened to her aſſiſtance, and, while ſhe held the water to Emily's lips, continued, "My dear young miſtreſs, do not take it ſo to heart; the Chevalier may be alive and well, for all this; let us hope the beſt!"</p>
                     <p>"O no! I cannot hope," ſaid Emily, "I am acquainted with circumſtances, that will not ſuffer me to hope. I am ſomewhat better now, and can hear what you have to ſay. Tell me, I entreat, the particulars of what you know."</p>
                     <p>"Stay till you are a little better, mademoiſelle, you look ſadly!"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="182" facs="unknown:029378_0318_0FE0881B3493AFB0"/>
"O no. Thereſa, tell me all, while I have the power to hear it," ſaid Emily, "tell me all, I conjure you!"</p>
                     <p>"Well, madam, I will then; but the ſteward did not ſay much, for Richard ſays he ſeemed ſhy of talking about Monſ. Valancourt, and what he gathered was from Gabriel, one of the ſervants, who ſaid he had heard it from my lord's gentleman."</p>
                     <p>"What did he hear?" ſaid Emily.</p>
                     <p>"Why, madam, Richard has but a bad memory, and could not remember half of it, and, if I had not aſked him a great many queſtions, I ſhould have heard little indeed. But he ſays that Gabriel ſaid, that he and all the other ſervants were in great trouble about M. Valancourt, for the he was ſuch a kind young gentleman, they all loved him, as well as if he had been their own brother—and now, to think what was become of him! For he uſed to be ſo courteous to them all and, if any of them had been in fault, M. Valancourt was the firſt to perſuade my lord to forgive them. And then, if any poor family was in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, M. Valancourt was the firſt, too, to relieve them, though ſome folks, not a great way off, could have afforded that much better than he. And then, ſaid Gabriel, he was ſo gentle to every body, and, for all he had ſeen a noble look with him, he never would command, and call about him, as ſome of your quality people do, and we never minded him the leſs for that. Nay, ſays Gabriel, for that matter, we minded him the more, and would all have run to obey him at a word, ſooner than if ſome folks had told us what to do at full length; aye, and were more afraid of diſpleaſing him, too, than of them that uſed rough words to us."</p>
                     <p>Emily, who no longer conſidered it to be dangerous to liſten to praiſe beſtowed on Valancourt, did not attempt to interrupt Thereſa, but ſat, attentive to her words, though almoſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with grief. "My Lord," continued Thereſa, "frets about M. Valancourt ſadly, and the more, becauſe, they ſay, he had been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ather harſh againſt him lately. Gabriel ſays he had it from my Lord's valet, that M. Valancourt had <hi>comported</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wildly at Paris, and had ſpent a great deal of money, more a great deal than my lord liked, for he loves money better than M. Valancourt, who had been led aſtray ſadly. Nay, for that matter, M. Valancourt had been put into priſon at Paris, and my Lord, ſays Gabriel, refuſed to take him out, and ſaid he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to ſuffer; and, when old Gregoire, the butler, heard of this, he actually bought a walking ſtick to take with him to Paris, to viſit his young maſter; but the next thing we hear is, that
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:029378_0318_0FE0881B3493AFB0"/>
M. Valancourt, is coming home. O, it was a joyful day when he came; but he was ſadly altered, and my Lord looked very cool upon him, and he was very ſad, indeed. And, ſoon after, he went away again into Languedoc, and, ſince that time, we have never ſeen him."</p>
                     <p>Thereſa pauſed, and Emily, ſighing deeply, remained with her eyes fixed upon the floor without ſpeaking. After a long pauſe, ſhe inquired what further Thereſa had heard. "Yet why ſhould I aſk?" ſhe added; "what you have already told is too much. O Valancourt! thou art gone—for ever gone! and I—I have murdered thee!" Theſe words, and the countenance of deſpair which accompanied them, alarmed Thereſa, who began to fear, that the ſhock of the intelligence Emily had juſt received, had affected her ſenſes. "My dear young lady, be compoſed," ſaid ſhe, "and do not ſay ſuch frightful words. You murder M. Valancourt,—dear heart!" Emily replied only by a heavy ſigh.</p>
                     <p>"Dear lady, it breaks my heart to ſee you look ſo," ſaid Thereſa, "do not ſit with your eyes upon the ground, and all ſo pale and melancholy; it frightens me to ſee you." Emily was ſtill ſilent, and did not appear to hear any thing that was ſaid to her. "Beſides, mademoiſelle," continued Thereſa, "M. Valancourt may be alive and merry yet, for what we know."</p>
                     <p>At the mention of his name, Emily raiſed her eyes, and fixed them, in a wild gaze upon Thereſa, as if ſhe was endeavouring to underſtand what had been ſaid. "Aye, my dear lady," ſaid Thereſa, miſtaking the meaning of this conſiderate air, "M. Valancourt may be alive and merry <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>et."</p>
                     <p>On the repetition of theſe words, Emily comprehended their import, but, inſtead of producing the effect intended, they ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only to heighten her diſtreſs. She roſe haſtily from her chair; paced the little room, with quick ſteps, and, often ſighing deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, claſped her hands, and ſhuddered.</p>
                     <p>Meanwhile, Thereſa, with ſimple, but honeſt affection, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to comfort her; put more wood on the fire, ſtirred it up into a brighter blaze, ſwept the hearth, ſet the chair, which Emily had left, in a warmer ſituation, and then drew forth from a cupboard a flaſk of wine. "It is a ſtormy night, madam," ſaid ſhe, "and blows cold—do come nearer the fire, and take a glaſs of this wine; it will comfort you, as it has done me, often and often, for it is not ſuch wine as one gets every day; it is rich Languedoc, and the laſt of ſix flaſks that M. Valancourt ſent me the night before he left Gaſcony for Paris. They have ferved me ever ſince, as cordials, and I never drink it, but I think of
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:029378_0319_0FE0881FCC5C9CA0"/>
him, and what kind words he ſaid to me when he gave them. Thereſa, ſays he, you are not young now, and ſhould have a glaſs of good wine, now and then. I will ſend you a few flaſks, and, when you taſte them, you will ſometimes remember me your friend. Yes, thoſe were his very words—me your friend!" Emily ſtill paced the room, without ſeeming to hear what The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſa ſaid, who continued ſpeaking. "And I have remembered him, often enough, poor young gentleman!—for he gave me this roof for a ſhelter, and that, which has ſupported me. Ah! he is in heaven, with my bleſſed maſter, if ever ſaint was!"</p>
                     <p>Thereſa's voice faltered; ſhe wept and ſet down the flaſk, unable to pour out the wine. Her grief ſeemed to recall Emily from her own, who went towards her, but then ſtopped, and, having gazed on her, for a moment, turned ſuddenly away, as if overwhelmed by the reflection, that it was Valancourt, whom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thereſa lamented.</p>
                     <p>While ſhe yet paced the room, the ſtill, ſoft note of an oboe, or flute, was heard mingling with the blaſt, the ſweetneſs of which affected Emily's ſpirits; ſhe pauſed a moment in atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the tender tones, as they ſwelled along the wind, till they were loſt again in the ruder guſt, came with a plaintiveneſs, that touched her heart, and ſhe melted into tears.</p>
                     <p>"Aye," ſaid Thereſa, drying her eyes, "there is Richard, our neighbour's ſon, playing on the oboe; it is ſad enough to hear ſuch ſweet muſic now." Emily continued to weep, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying. "He often plays of an evening," added Thereſa, "and, ſometimes, the young folks dance to the ſound of his oboe. But, dear young lady! do not cry ſo; and pray take a glaſs of this wine," continued ſhe, pouring ſome into a glaſs, and handing i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to Emily, who reluctantly took it.</p>
                     <p>"Taſte it for M. Valancourt's ſake," ſaid Thereſa, as Emily lifted the glaſs to her lips, "for he gave it to me, you know, madam." Emily's hand trembled, and ſhe ſplit the wine as ſhe withdrew it from her lips. "For whoſe ſake!—who gave the wine?" ſaid ſhe in a faltering voice. "M. Valancourt, dear lady. I knew you would be pleaſed with it. It is the laſt flaſk I have left."</p>
                     <p>Emily ſet the wine upon the table, and burſt into tears, while Thereſa diſappointed and alarmed, tried to comfort her; but ſhe only waved her hand, entreated ſhe might be left alone, and wept the more.</p>
                     <p>A knock at the cottage door prevented Thereſa from imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately obeying her miſtreſs, and ſhe was going to open it, when
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:029378_0319_0FE0881FCC5C9CA0"/>
Emily, checking her, requeſted ſhe would not admit any perſon; but, afterwards, recollecting, that ſhe had ordered her ſervant to attend her home, ſhe ſaid it was only Philippe, and endeavoured to reſtrain her tears, while Thereſa opened the door.</p>
                     <p>A voice, that ſpoke without, drew Emily's attention. She liſtened, turned her eyes to the door, when, a perſon now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and immediately a bright gleam, that flaſhed from the fire, diſcovered Valancourt!</p>
                     <p>Emily, on perceiving him, ſtarted from her chair, trembled, and, ſinking into it again, became inſenſible to all around her.</p>
                     <p>A ſcream from Thereſa now told, that ſhe knew Valancourt, whom her imperfect ſight, and the duſkineſs of the place had prevented her from immediately recollecting; but his attention was immediately called from her to the perſon, whom he ſaw, falling from a chair near the fire; and, haſtening to her aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, he perceived he was ſupporting Emily! The various emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that ſeized him upon thus unexpectedly meeting with her, from whom he had believed he had parted for ever, and on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding her pale and lifeleſs in his arms—may, perhaps, be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, though they could neither be then expreſſed, or now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, any more than Emily's ſenſations, when, at length, ſhe uncloſed her eyes, and, looking up, again ſaw Valancourt. The intenſe anxiety, with which he regarded her, was inſtantly chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to an expreſſion of mingled joy and tenderneſs, as his eye met hers, and he perceived, that ſhe was reviving. But he could only exclaim, "Emily!" as he ſilently watched her recovery, while ſhe averted her eye, and feebly attempted to withdraw her hand; but, in theſe the firſt moments which ſucceeded to the pangs his ſuppoſed death had occaſioned her, ſhe forgot every fault, which had formerly claimed indignation, and beholding Valancourt, ſuch as he appeared, when he won her early affection, ſhe experienced emotions of only tenderneſs and joy. This, alas! was but the ſunſhine of a few ſhort moments; recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions roſe, like clouds, upon her mind, and, darkening the illuſive image, that poſſeſſed it, ſhe again beheld Valancourt degraded—Valancourt unworthy of the eſteem and tenderneſs ſhe had once beſtowed upon him; her ſpirits faltered, and, withdrawing her hand, ſhe turned from him to conceal her grief, while he, yet more embarraſſed and agitated, remained ſilent.</p>
                     <p>A ſenſe of what ſhe owed to herſelf reſtrained her tears, and taught her ſoon to overcome, in ſome degree, the emotions of mingled joy, and ſorrow, that contended at her heart, as ſhe roſe, and, having thanked him for the aſſiſtance he had given her, bade
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:029378_0320_0FE0882CF0C2E130"/>
Thereſa good evening. As ſhe was leaving the cottage, Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court, who ſeemed ſuddenly awakened as from a dream, entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in a voice that pleaded powerfully for compaſſion, a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments attention. Emily's heart perhaps, pleaded as powerfully, but ſhe had reſolution enough to reſiſt both, together with the clamorous entreaties of Thereſa, that ſhe would not venture home alone in the dark, and had already opened the cottage door, when the pelting ſtorm compelled her to obey their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts.</p>
                     <p>Silent and embarraſſed, ſhe returned to the fire, while Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court, with increaſing agitation, paced the room, as if he wiſhed, yet feared to ſpeak, and Thereſa expreſſed without reſtraint her joy and wonder upon ſeeing him.</p>
                     <p>"Dear heart! ſir," ſaid ſhe, "I never was ſo ſurpriſed and overjoyed in my life. We were in great tribulation before you came, for we thought you was dead, and were talking and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting about you, juſt when you knocked at the door. My young miſtreſs there was crying, fit to break her heart.—"</p>
                     <p>Emily looked with much diſpleaſure at Thereſa, but, before ſhe could ſpeak, Valancourt, unable to repreſs the emotion, which Thereſa's imprudent diſcovery occaſioned, exclaimed, "O my Emily! am I then ſtill dear to you! Did you, indeed, hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our me with a thought—a tear? O heavens! you weep—you weep now!"</p>
                     <p>"Thereſa, ſir," ſaid Emily, with a reſerved air, and trying to conquer her tears, "has reaſon to remember you with gratitude, and ſhe was concerned, becauſe ſhe had not lately heard of you. Allow me to thank you for the kindneſs you have ſhewn her, and to ſay, that, ſince I am now upon the ſpot, ſhe muſt not be further indebted to you."</p>
                     <p>"Emily!" ſaid Valancourt, no longer maſter of his emotions, "is it thus you meet him, whom once you meant to honour with your hand—thus you meet him, who has loved you—ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for you?—Yet what do I ſay? Pardon me, pardon me, mademoiſelle St. Aubert, I know not what I utter. I have no longer any claim upon your remembrance—I have forfeited every pretenſion to your eſteem, your love. Yes! let me not forget that I once poſſeſſed your affections, though to know that I have loſt them, is my ſevereſt affliction. Affliction—do I call it!—that is a term of mildneſs."</p>
                     <p>"Dear heart!" ſaid Thereſa, preventing Emily from reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, "talk of once having her affections! Why, my dear young lady loves you now, better than ſhe does any body in the whole world, though ſhe pretends to deny it."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="187" facs="unknown:029378_0320_0FE0882CF0C2E130"/>
"This is inſupportable!" ſaid Emily; "Thereſa, you know not what you ſay. Sir, if you reſpect my tranquillity, you will ſpare me from the continuance of this diſtreſs."</p>
                     <p>"I do reſpect your tranquillity too much, voluntarily to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt it," replied Valancourt, in whoſe boſom pride now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with tenderneſs; "and will not be a voluntary intruder. I would have entreated a few moments attention—yet I know not for what purpoſe. You have ceaſed to eſteem me, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to you my ſufferings will degrade me more, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing even your pity. Yet I have been, O Emily! I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed very wretched!" added Valancourt, in a voice, that ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened from ſolemnity into grief.</p>
                     <p>"What! is my dear young maſter going out in all this rain!" ſaid Thereſa. "No, he ſhall not ſtir a ſtep. Dear! dear! to ſee how gentlefolks can afford to throw away their happineſs! Now, if you were poor people, there would be none of this. To talk of unworthineſs, and not caring about one another, when I know there are not ſuch a kind hearted lady and gentleman in the whole province, nor any that love one another half ſo well, if the truth was ſpoken!"</p>
                     <p>"Emily, in extreme vexation, now roſe from her chair, "I muſt be gone," ſaid ſhe, "the ſtorm is over."</p>
                     <p>"Stay, Emily, ſtay, mademoiſelle St. Aubert!" ſaid Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court, ſummoning all his reſolution, "I will no longer diſtreſs you by my preſence. Forgive me, that I did not ſooner obey you, and, if you can, ſometimes, pity one, who, in loſing you—has loſt all hope of peace! May you be happy, Emily, however wretched I remain, happy as my fondeſt wiſh would have you!"</p>
                     <p>His voice faltered with the laſt words, and his countenance changed, while, with a look of ineffable tenderneſs and grief, he gazed upon her for an inſtant, and then quitted the cottage.</p>
                     <p>"Dear heart! dear heart!" cried Thereſa, following him to the door, "why, Monſieur Valancourt! how it rains! what a night is this to turn him out in! why it will give him his death; and it was but now you was crying, mademoiſelle, becauſe he was dead. Well! young ladies do change their minds in a minute, as one may ſay!"</p>
                     <p>Emily made no reply, for ſhe heard not what was ſaid, while, loſt in ſorrow and thought, ſhe remained in her chair by the fire, with her eyes fixed, and the image of Valancourt ſtill before them.</p>
                     <p>"M. Valancourt is ſadly altered! madam," ſaid Thereſa, "he looks ſo thin to what he uſed to do, and ſo melancholy, and then he wears his arm in a ſling."</p>
                     <p>

Emily raiſed her eyes at theſe words, for ſhe had not obſerved this laſt circumſtance, and ſhe now did not doubt, that Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court had received the ſhot of her gardener at Tholouſe; with this conviction her pity for him returning, ſhe blamed herſelf for having occaſioned him to leave the cottage, during the ſtorm.</p>
                     <p>Soon after her ſervants arrived with the carriage, and Emily, having cenſured Thereſa for her thoughtleſs converſation to Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancourt, and ſtrictly charging her never to repeat any hints of the ſame kind to him, withdrew to her home, thoughtful and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate.</p>
                     <p>Meanwhile, Valancourt had returned to a little inn of the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, whither he had arrived only a few moments before his viſit to Thereſa's cottage, on the way from Tholouſe to the chateau of the Count de Duvarney, where he had not been ſince he bade adieu to Emily at the Chateau-le-Blanc, in the neighbourhood of which he had lingered for a conſiderable time, unable to ſummon reſolution enough to quit a place, that contained the object moſt dear to his heart. There were times, indeed, when grief and deſpair urged him to appear again before Emily, and, regardleſs of his ruined circumſtances, to renew his ſuit. Pride, however, and the tenderneſs of his affection, which could not long endure the thought of involving her in his misfortunes, at length, ſo far triumphed over paſſion, that he relinquiſhed this deſperate deſign, and quitted Chateau-le-Blanc. But ſtill his fancy wandered among the ſcenes, which had witneſſed his early love, and, on his way to Gaſcony, he ſtopped at Tholouſe, where he remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when Emily arrived, concealing, yet indulging his melancholy in the gardens, where he had formerly paſſed with her ſo many happy hours; often recurring, with vain regret, to the evening before her departure for Italy, when ſhe had ſo unexpectedly met him on the terrace, and endeavouring to recall to his memory every word and look, which had then charmed him, the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he had employed to diſſuade her from the journey, and the tenderneſs of their laſt farewel.</p>
                     <p>In ſuch melancholy recollections he had been indulging, when Emily unexpectedly appeared to him on this very terrace, the evening after her arrival at Tholouſe. His emotions, on thus ſeeing her, can ſcarcely be imagined; but he ſo far overcame the firſt promptings of love, that he for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ore to diſcover himſelf, and abrubtly quitted the gardens. Still, however, the viſion he had ſeen haunted his mind; he became more wretched than before, and the only ſolace of his ſorrow was to return in the ſilence of the night; to follow the paths which he believed her ſteps had
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:029378_0321_0FE088318D94D650"/>
preſſed, during the day; and, to watch round the habitation where ſhe repoſed. It was in one of theſe mournful wanderings, that he had received by the fire of the gardener, who miſtook him for a robber, a wound in his arm, which had detained him at Tholouſe till very lately, under the hands of a ſurgeon. There, regardleſs of himſelf and careleſs of his friends, whoſe late un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs had urged him to believe, that they were indifferent as to his fate, he remained, without informing them of his ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and now, being ſufficiently recovered to bear travelling, he had taken La Vallee in his way to Eſtuviere, the Count's reſidence, partly for the purpoſe of hearing of Emily, and of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again near her, and partly for that of inquiring into the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of poor old Thereſa, who, he had reaſon to ſuppoſe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ad been deprived of her ſtipend, ſmall as it was, and which inquiry had brought him to her cottage, when Emily happened to be there.</p>
                     <p>This unexpected interview, which had at once ſhewn him the tenderneſs of her love and the ſtrength of her reſolution, renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the acuteneſs of the deſpair, that had attended their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſeparation, and which no effort of reaſon could teach him, in theſe moments, to ſubdue. Her image, her look, the tones of her voice, all dwelt on his fancy, as powerfully as they had lately appeared to his ſenſes, and baniſhed from his heart every emotion, except thoſe of love and deſpair.</p>
                     <p>Before the evening concluded, he returned to Thereſa's cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, that he might hear her talk of Emily, and be in the place, were ſhe had ſo lately been. The joy, felt and expreſſed by that faithful ſervant, was quickly changed to ſorrow, when ſhe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, at one moment, his wild and phrenſied look, and, at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the dark melancholy that overhung him.</p>
                     <p>After he had liſtened, and for a conſiderable time, to all ſhe had to relate, concerning Emily, he gave Thereſa nearly all the money he had about him, though ſhe repeatedly refuſed it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, that her miſtreſs had amply ſupplied her wants; and then, drawing a ring of value from his finger, he delivered it her with a ſolemn charge to preſent it to Emily; of whom he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, as a laſt favour, that ſhe would preſerve it for his ſake, and ſometimes, when ſhe looked upon it remember the unhappy giver.</p>
                     <p>Thereſa wept as ſhe received the ring, but it was more from ſympathy than from any preſentiment of evil; and before ſhe could reply, Valancourt abruptly left the cottage. She followed him to the door, calling upon his name and entreating him to return; but ſhe received no anſwer, and ſaw him no more.</p>

                     <p>ON the following morning, as Emily ſat in the parlour ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining the library, reflecting on the ſcene of the preceding night, Annette ruſhed wildly into the room, and, without ſpeaking, ſunk breathleſs into a chair. It was ſometime before ſhe could an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the anxious inquiries of Emily, as to the occaſion of her emotion, but, at length, ſhe exclaimed, "I have ſeen his ghoſt, madam, I have ſeen his ghoſt!"</p>
                     <p>"Who do you mean?" ſaid Emily, with extreme impatience.</p>
                     <p>"It came in from the hall, madam," continued Annette, "as I was croſſing to the parlour."</p>
                     <p>"Who are you ſpeaking of?" repeated Emily," who came in from the hall?"</p>
                     <p>"It was dreſſed juſt as I have ſeen him, often and often," added Annette. "Ah! who could have thought—"</p>
                     <p>Emily's patience was now exhauſted, and ſhe was reprimand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her for ſuch idle fancies, when a ſervant entered the room, and informed her, that a ſtranger without begged leave to ſpeak with her.</p>
                     <p>It immediately occurred to Emily, that this ſtranger was Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt, and ſhe told the ſervant to inform him, that ſhe was engaged, and could not ſee any perſon. The ſervant having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered his meſſage, returned with one from the ſtranger, urging the firſt requeſt, and ſaying that he had ſomething of conſequence to communicate; while Annette, who had hitherto ſat ſilent and amazed, now ſtarted up, and crying, "It is Ludovico!—it is Ludovico!" ran out of the room. Emily bade the ſervant follow her, and, if it really was Ludovico, to ſhew him into the parlour.</p>
                     <p>In a few minutes, Ludovico appeared, accompanied by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette, who, as joy rendered her forgetful of all rules of decorum towards her miſtreſs, would not ſuffer any perſon to be heard for ſometime but herſelf. Emily expreſſed ſurpriſe and ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, on ſeeing Ludovico in ſafety, and the firſt emotions increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when he delivered letters from Count De Villefort and the Lady Blanche, informing her of their late adventure, and of their preſent ſituation at an inn among the Pyrenees, where they had
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:029378_0322_0FE0883E5702D6B0"/>
been detained by the illneſs of Monſ. St. Foix, and the indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Blanche, who added, that the Baron St Foix was juſt arrived to attend his ſon to his chateau, where he would remain till the perfect recovery of his wounds, and then return to Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc, but that her father and herſelf purpoſed to be at La Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee, on the following day. She added, that Emily's preſence would be expected at the approaching nuptials, and begged ſhe would be prepared to proceed, in a few days, to Chateau-le-Blanc. For an account of Ludovico's adventure, ſhe referred her to himſelf; and Emily, though much intereſted, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the means, by which he had diſappeared from the north apartments, had the forbearance to ſuſpend the gratification of her curioſity, till he had taken ſome refreſhment, and had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with Annette, whoſe joy, on ſeeing him in ſafety, could not have been more extravagant, had he ariſen from the grave.</p>
                     <p>Meanwhile, Emily peruſed again the letters of her friends, whoſe expreſſions of eſteem and kindneſs were very neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations to her heart, awakened as it was by the late interview to emotions of keener ſorrow and regret.</p>
                     <p>The invitation to Chateau-le-Blanc was preſſed with ſo much kindneſs by the Count and his daughter, who ſtrengthened it by a meſſage from the Counteſs, and the occaſion of it was ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant to her friend, that Emily could not refuſe to accept it, nor, though ſhe wiſhed to remain in the quiet ſhades of her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive home, could ſhe avoid perceiving the impropriety of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining there alone, ſince Valancourt was again in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood. Sometimes, too, ſhe thought, that change of ſcenery and the ſociety of her friends might contribute, more than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, to reſtore her to tranquillity.</p>
                     <p>When Ludovico again appeared, ſhe deſired him to give a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail of his adventure in the north apartments, and to tell by what means he became a companion of the banditti, with whom the Count had found him.</p>
                     <p>He immediately obeyed, while Annette, who had not yet had leiſure to aſk him many queſtions, on the ſubject, prepared to liſten with a countenance of extreme curioſity, venturing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind her lady of her incredulity, concerning ſpirits, in the caſtle of Udolpho, and of her own ſagacity in believing in them; while Emily, bluſhing at the conſciouſneſs of her late credulity, obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that, if Ludovico's adventure could juſtify Annette's ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, he had probably not been here to relate it.</p>
                     <p>Ludovico ſmiled at Annette, and bowed to Emily, and then began as follows:</p>

"You may remember, madam, that, on the night, when I ſat up in the north chamber my lord, the Count, and Mooſ. Henri accompanied me thither, and that, while they remained there, nothing happened to excite any alarm. When they were gone I made a fire in the bed room, and, not being inclined to ſleep, I ſat down on the hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"O very like it, I dare ſay," interrupted Annette, "and I dare ſay too, if the truth was known, you ſhook from head to foot."</p>
                     <p>"Not quite ſo bad as that," replied Ludovico, ſmiling, "but ſeveral times, as the wind whiſtled round the caſtle, and ſhook the old caſements, I did fancy I heard odd noiſes, and, once or twice, I got up and looked about me; but nothing was to be ſeen, except the grim figures in the tapeſtry, which ſeemed to frown upon me, as I looked at them. I had ſat thus for above an hour," continued Ludovico, "when again I thought I heard a noiſe, and glanced my eyes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

But preſently I was awakened by the noiſe I had heard before, and it ſeemed to come from that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> of the chamber, where the bed ſtood; and then, whether it was the ſtory I had been reading that affected my ſpirits, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when I looked towards the bed again, I fancied I ſaw a man's face within the duſky <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>tains."</p>
                     <p>At the mention of this, Emily trembled, and looked anxiouſly, remembering the ſpectacle ſhe had herſelf witneſſed there with Dorothee.</p>
                     <p>"I confeſs, madam, my heart did fail me, at that infrant," continued Ludovico, "but a return of the noiſe drew my atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the bed, and I then diſtinctly heard a ſound, like that of a key, turning in a lock, but what ſurpriſed me more was, that I ſaw no door where the ſound ſeemed to come from. In the next moment, however, the arras near the bed was ſlowly lifted, and a perſon appeared behind it, entering from a ſmall door in the wall. He ſtood for a moment as if half retreating, with his head bending under the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> which concealed the upper part of his face, except his eyes ſcowling beneath the tapeſtry as he held it; and then, while he raiſed it higher, I ſaw the face of another man behind, looking over his ſhoulder. I know not how it was,
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:029378_0323_0FE08842EC445A08"/>
but, though my ſword was upon the table before me, I had not the power juſt then to ſeize it, but ſat quite ſtill, watching them, with my eyes half ſhut as if I was aſleep. I ſuppoſe they thought me ſo, and were debating what they ſhould do, for I heard them whiſper, and they ſtood in the ſame poſture for the value of a minute, and then, I thought I perceived other faces in the duſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kineſs beyond the door, and heard louder whiſpers."</p>
                     <p>"This door ſurpriſes me," ſaid Emily, "becauſe I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that the Count had cauſed the arras to be lifted, and the walls examined, ſuſpecting, that they might have concealed a paſſage through which you had departed."</p>
                     <p>"It does not appear ſo extraordinary to me, madam," replied Ludovico, "that this door ſhould eſcape notice, becauſe it was formed in a narrow compartment, which appeared to be part of the outward wall, and, if the Count had not paſſed over it, he might have thought it was uſeleſs to ſearch for a door where it ſeemed as if no paſſage could communicate with one; but the truth was, that the paſſage was formed within the wall itſelf.—But, to return to the men, whom I ſaw obſcurely beyond the door, and who did not ſuffer me to remain long in ſuſpenſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their deſign. They all ruſhed into the room, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded me, though not before I had ſnatched up my ſword to defend myſelf. But what could one man do againſt four? They ſoon diſarmed me, and, having faſtened my arms, and gagged my mouth, forced me through the private door, leaving my ſword upon the table, to aſſiſt, as they ſaid, thoſe who ſhould come in the morning to look for me, in fighting againſt the ghoſts. They then led me through many narrow paſſages, cut, as I fancied, in the walls, for I had never ſeen them before, and down ſeveral flights of ſteps, till we came to the vaults under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the caſtle; and then opening a ſtone door, which I ſhould have taken for the wall itſelf, we went through a long paſſage, and down other ſteps cut in the ſolid rock, when another door delivered us into a cave. After turning and twining about, for ſometime, we reached the mouth of it, and I found myſelf on the ſea beach at the foot of the cliffs, with the chateau above. A <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>oar was in waiting, into which the ruffians got, forcing me along with them, and we ſoon reached, a ſmall veſſel, that was at anchor, where other men appeared, when ſetting me aboard, two of the fellows who had ſeized me followed, and the other two <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>owed back to the ſhore, while we ſet ſail. I ſoon found out what all this meant, and what was the buſineſs of theſe men at the chateau. We landed in Rouſillon, and, after lingering ſeveral
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:029378_0324_0FE088526DCF4B80"/>
days about the ſhore, ſome of their comrades came down from the mountains, and carried me with them to the fort, where I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained till my Lord ſo unexpectedly arrived, for they had taken good care to prevent my running away, having blindfolded me, during the journey, and, if they had not done this, I think I never could have found my road to any town, through the wild country we traverſed. After I reached the ſort I was watched like a priſoner, and never ſuffered to go out, without two or three companions, and I became ſo weary of life, that I often wiſhed to get rid of it."</p>
                     <p>"Well, but they let you talk," ſaid Annette, "they did not gagg you after they got you away from the chateau, ſo I don't ſee what reaſon there was to be ſo very weary of living; to ſay nothing about the chance you had of ſeeing me again."</p>
                     <p>Ludovico ſmiled, and Emily alſo, who inquired what was the motive of theſe men for carrying him off.</p>
                     <p>"I ſoon found out, madam," reſumed Ludovico, "that they were pirates, who had, during many years, ſecreted their ſpoil in the vaults of the caſtle, which, being ſo near the ſea, ſuited their purpoſe well. To prevent detection they had tried to have in believed that the chateau was haunted, and, having diſcovered the private way to the north apartments, which had been ſhut up ever ſince the death of the lady marchioneſs, they eaſily ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded. The houſekeeper and her huſband, who were the only perſons, that had inhabited the caſtle, for ſome years, were ſo terrified by the ſtrange noiſes they heard in the nights, that they would live there no longer; a report ſoon went abroad, that it was haunted, and the whole country believed this the more read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily, I ſuppoſe, becauſe it had been ſaid, that the lady marchioneſs had died in a ſtrange way, and becauſe my lord never would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the place afterwards."</p>
                     <p>"But why," ſaid Emily, "were not theſe pirates contented with the cave—why did they think it neceſſary to depoſit their ſpoil in the caſtle?"</p>
                     <p>"The cave, madam," replied Ludovico, "was open to any body, and their treaſures would not long have remained undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered there, but in the vaults they were ſecure ſo long as the report prevailed of their being haunted. Thus then, it appears, that they brought at midnight, the ſpoil they took on the ſeas, and kept it till they had opportunities of diſpoſing of it to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. The pirates were connected with Spaniſh ſmugglers and banditti, who live among the wilds of the Pyrenees, and carry on various kinds of traffic, ſuch as nobody would think of; and
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:029378_0324_0FE088526DCF4B80"/>
with this deſperate horde of banditti I remained, till my lord arrived. I ſhall never forget what I felt, when I firſt diſcovered him—I almoſt gave him up for loſt! but I knew, that, if I ſhewed myſelf, the banditti would diſcover who he was, and probably murder us all, to prevent their ſecret in the chateau being detected. I, therefore, kept out of my lord's ſight, but had a ſtrict watch upon the ruffians, and determined, if they offered him or his family violence, to diſcover myſelf, and ſight for our lives. Soon after, I overhead ſome of them laying a moſt diabolical plan for the murder and plunder of the whole party, when I contrived to ſpeak to ſome of my lord's attendants, telling them what was going forward, and we conſulted what was beſt to be done; meanwhile my lord, alarmed at the abſence of the Lady Blanche demanded her, and the ruffians having given ſome unſatisfactory anſwer, my lord and Monſ. St. Foix became furious, ſo then we thought it a good time to diſcover the plot, and ruſhing into the chamber, I called out, "Treachery! my Lord Count, defend yourſelf!" His lordſhip and the chevalier drew their ſwords directly, and a hard battle we had, but we conquered at laſt, as, madam, you are already informed of by my Lord Count."</p>
                     <p>"This is an extraordinary adventure," ſaid Emily, "and much praiſe is due, Ludovico, to your prudence and intrepidity. There are ſome circumſtances, however, concerning the north apartments, which ſtill perplex me; but, perhaps, you may be able to explain them. Did you ever hear the banditti relate any thing extraordinary of theſe rooms."</p>
                     <p>"No, madam," replied Ludovico," I never heard them ſpeak about the rooms, except to laugh at the credulity of the old houſekeeper, who once was very near catching one of the pirates; it was ſince the Count arrived at the chateau, he ſaid, and he laughed heartily as he related the trick he had played off."</p>
                     <p>A bluſh overſpread Emily's cheek, and ſhe impatiently deſired Ludovico to explain himſelf.</p>
                     <p>"Why, my lady," ſaid he, "as this fellow was, one night in the bed room, he heard ſomebody approaching through the next apartment, and not having time to lift up the arras, and unfaſten the door, he hid himſelf in the bed juſt by.

                     <p>"As you was in," interrupted Annette, "when you ſat up ſo boldly to watch by yourſelf."</p>
                     <p>"Aye," ſaid Ludovico, "in as great a fright as he ever made any body elſe ſuffer; and preſently the houſekeeper and ſome

other perſon came up to the bed, when he, thinking they were going to examine it, bethought him, that his only chance of eſcaping detection, was by terrifying them; ſo he lifted up the counterpane, but that did not do, till he raiſed his face above it, and then they both ſet off, he ſaid, as if they had ſeen the devil, and he got out of the rooms undiſcovered."</p>
                     <p>Emily could not forbear ſmiling at this explanation of the deception, which had given her ſo much ſuperſtitious terror, and was ſurpriſed, that ſhe could have ſuffered herſelf to be thus alarmed, till ſhe conſidered, that, when the mind has once begun to yield to the weakneſs of ſuperſtition, trifles impreſs it with the force of conviction. Still, however, ſhe remembered with awe, the myſterious muſic, which had been heard, at midnight, near Chateau-le-Blanc, and ſhe aſked Ludovico if he could give any explanation of it; but he could not.</p>
                     <p>"I only know, madam," he added, "that it did not belong to the pirates, for I have heard them laugh about it, and ſay, they believed the devil was in league with them there."</p>
                     <p>"Yes, I will anſwer for it he was," ſaid Annette, her countenance brightening. "I was ſure all along, that he or his ſpirits had ſomething to do with the north apartments, and now you ſee, madam, I am right at laſt."</p>
                     <p>"It cannot be denied, that his ſpirits were very buſy in that part of the chateau," replied Emily, ſmiling. "But I am ſurpriſed, Ludovico, that theſe pirates ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>

                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>uld they expect but certain detection?"</p>
                     <p>"I have reaſon to believe, madam," replied Ludovico, "that it was their intention to perſevere no longer than was neceſſary for the removal of the ſtores, which were depoſited in the vaults; and it appeared, that they had been employed in doing ſo from within a ſhort period after the Count's arrival; but, as they had only a few hours in the night for this buſineſs, and were carrying on other ſchemes at the ſame time, the vaults were not above half emptied, when they took me away. They gloried exceedingly in this opportunity of confirming the ſuperſtitious reports, that had been ſpread of the north chambers, were careful to leave every thing there as they had found it, the better to promote the deception, and frequently, in their jocoſe moods, would laugh at the conſternation which they believed the inhabitants of the caſtle had ſuffered upon my diſappearing, and it was to prevent the poſſibility of my betraying their ſecret, that they had removed me to ſuch a diſtance. From that period, they conſidered the
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:029378_0325_0FE0885744B7E2C0"/>
chateau as nearly their own; but I found from the diſcourſe of their comrades, that, though they were cautious, at firſt, in ſhewing their power there, they had once very nearly betrayed themſelves. Going, one night, as was their cuſtom, to the north chambers to repeat the noiſes, that had occaſioned ſuch alarm among the ſervants, they heard, as they were about to unfaſten the ſecret door, voices in the bed room. My lord has ſince told me, that himſelf and M. Henri were then in the apartment, and they heard very extraordinary ſounds of lamentation, which it ſeems were made by theſe fellows, with their uſual deſign of ſpreading terror, and my lord has owned, he then felt ſomewhat more than ſurpriſe; but, as it was neceſſary to the peace of his family, that no notice ſhould be taken, he was ſilent on the ſubject, and enjoined ſilence to his ſon."</p>
                     <p>Emily, recollecting the change, that had appeared in the ſpirits of the Count, after the night, when he had watched in the north room, now perceived the cauſe of it; and, having made ſome further inquiries upon this ſtrange affair, ſhe diſmiſſed Ludovico, and went to give orders for the accommodation of her friends on the following day.</p>
                     <p>In the evening, Thereſa, lame as ſhe was, came to deliver the ring, with which Valancourt had entruſted her, and, when ſhe preſented it, Emily was much affected, for ſhe remembered to have ſeen him wear it often in happier days. She was however, much diſpleaſed, that Thereſa had received it, and poſitively refuſed to accept it herſelf, though to have done ſo would have afforded her a melancholy pleaſure. Thereſa entreated, expoſtulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and then deſcribed the diſtreſs of Valancourt, when he had given the ring, and repeated the meſſage, with which he had commiſſioned her to deliver it; and Emily could not conceal the extreme ſorrow this recital occaſioned her, but wept, and remained loſt in thought.</p>
                     <p>"Alas! my dear young lady!" ſaid Thereſa, "why ſhould all this be? I have known you from your infancy, and it may well be ſuppoſed I love you; as if you was my own, and wiſh as much to ſee you happy. M. Valancourt, to be ſure, I have not known ſo long, but then I have reaſon to love him, as though he was my own ſon. I know how well you love one another, or why all this weeping and wailing?" Emily waved her hand for Thereſa to be ſilent, who, diſregarding the ſignal, continued, "And how much you are alike in your tempers and ways, and, that, if you were married, you would be the happieſt couple in the whole province—then what is there to prevent your marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:029378_0326_0FE08861DF629390"/>
Dear dear! to ſee how ſome people fling away their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and then cry and lament about it, juſt as if it was not their own doing, and as if there was more pleaſure in wailing and weeping, than in being at peace. Learning, to be ſure, is a fine thing, but, if it teaches folks no better than that, why I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be without it; if it would teach them to be happier I would ſay ſomething to it, then it would be learning and wiſdom too."</p>
                     <p>Age and long ſervices had given Thereſa a privilege to talk, but Emily now endeavoured to check her loquacity, and, though ſhe felt the juſtneſs of ſome of her remarks, did not chooſe to explain the circumſtances that had determined her conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Valancourt. She, therefore, only told Thereſa, that it would much diſpleaſe her to hear the ſubject renewed; that ſhe had reaſons for her conduct, which ſhe did not think it proper to mention, and that the ring muſt be returned, with an aſſurance, that ſhe could not accept it with propriety; and, at the ſame time, ſhe forbade Thereſa to repeat any future meſſage from Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt, as ſhe valued her eſteem and kindneſs. Thereſa was afflicted, and made another attempt, though feeble, to intereſt her for Valancourt, but the unuſual diſpleaſure, expreſſed in Emily's countenance, ſoon obliged her to deſiſt, and ſhe departed in won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and lamentation.</p>
                     <p>To relieve her mind in ſome degree, from the painful recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, that intruded upon it, Emily buſied herſelf in prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the journey into Languedoc, and, while Annette, who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted her, ſpoke with joy and affection of the ſafe return of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovico, ſhe was conſidering how ſhe might beſt promote their happineſs, and determined, if it appeared, that his affection was as unchanged as that of the ſimple and honeſt Annette, to give her a marriage portion, and ſett<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Theſe conſiderations led her to the remembrance of her father's paternal domain, which his affairs had formerly compelled him to diſpoſe of to M. Queſnel, and which ſhe frequently wiſhed to regain, becauſe St. Aubert had lamented, that the chief lands of his anceſtors had paſſed into another family, and becauſe they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

To the eſtate at Tholouſe ſhe had no peculiar attachment, and it was her wiſh to diſpoſe of this, that ſhe might purchaſe her paternal domains, if M. Queſnel could be prevailed on to part with them, which, as he talked much of living in Italy, did not appear very improbable.</p>

                     <p>ON the following day, the arrival of her friend revived the drooping Emily, and La Vallee became once more the ſcene of ſocial kindneſs and of elegant hoſpitality. Illneſs and the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror ſhe had ſuffered had ſtolen from Blanche much of her ſpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, but all her affectionate ſimplicity remained, and, though ſhe appeared leſs blooming, ſhe was not leſs engaging than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The unfortunate adventure on the Pyrenees had made the Count very anxious to reach home, and, after little more than a week's ſtay at La Vallee, Emily prepared to ſet out with her friends for Languedoc, aſſigning the care of her houſe, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her abſence, to Thereſa. On the evening, preceding her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, this old ſervant brought again the ring of Valancourt, and, with tears, entreated her miſtreſs to receive it, for that ſhe had neither ſeen or heard of M. Valancourt, ſince the night when he delivered it to her. As ſhe ſaid this, her countenance expreſſed more alarm, than ſhe dared to utter; but Emily, checking her own propenſity to fear conſidered, that he had probably return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the reſidence of his brother, and, again refuſing to accept the ring, bade Thereſa preſerve it, till ſhe ſaw him, which, with extreme reluctance, ſhe promiſed to do.</p>
                     <p>On the following day, Count De Villefort, with Emily and the Lady Blanche, left La Vallee, and, on the enſuing evening, arrived at the Chateau-le Blanc, where the Counteſs, Henri, and M. Du Pont, whom Emily was ſurpriſed to find there, received them with much joy and congratulation. She was concerned to obſerve, that the Count ſtill encouraged the hopes of his friend, whoſe countenance declared, that his affection had ſuffered no abatement from abſence, and was much diſtreſſed, when, on the ſecond evening after her arrival, the Count, having withdrawn her from the Lady Blanche, with whom ſhe was walking, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed the ſubject of M. Du Pont's hopes. The mildneſs, with which ſhe liſtened to his interceſſions at firſt, deceiving him, as to her ſentiments, he began to believe, that, her affection for Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt being overcome, ſhe was, at length, diſpoſed to think fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably of M. Du Pont; and, when ſhe afterwards convinced
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:029378_0327_0FE089518044F840"/>
him of his miſtake, he ventured, in the earneſtneſs of his wiſh to promote what he conſidered to be the happineſs of two perſons, whom he ſo much eſteemed, gently to remonſtrate with her, on thus ſuffering an ill placed affection to poiſon the happineſs of her moſt valuable years.</p>
                     <p>Obſerving her ſilence and the deep dejection of her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, he concluded with ſaying, "I will not ſay more now, but I will ſtill believe, my dear Mademoiſelle St. Aubert, that you will not always reject a perſon, ſo truly eſtimable as my friend Du Pont."</p>
                     <p>He ſpared her the pain of replying, by leaving her; and ſhe ſtrolled on, ſomewhat diſpleaſed with the Count for having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevered to plead for a ſuit, which ſhe had repeatedly rejected, and loſt amidſt the melancholy recollections, which this topic had revived, till ſhe had inſenſibly reached the borders of the woods, that ſcreened the monaſtery of St. Clair, when, perceiving how far ſhe had wandered, ſhe determined to extend her walk a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle farther, and to inquire after the abbeſs and ſome of her friends among the nuns.</p>
                     <p>Though the evening was now drawing to a cloſe, ſhe accepted the invitation of the friar, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap> proceeded towards the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent parlour. As ſhe croſſed the lawn, that ſloped from the front of the monaſtery, towards the ſea, ſhe was ſtruck with the picture of repoſe, exhibited by ſome monks, ſitting in the cloiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which extended under the brow of the woods, that crowned this eminence; where, as they meditated, at this twilight hour holy ſubjects, they ſometimes ſuffered their attention to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by the ſcene before them, not thought it profane to lock at nature, now that it had exchanged the brilliant colour, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> ſpread an ancient cheſnut, whoſe ample branches were deſigned to ſcreen the full magnificence of a ſcene, that might tempt the wiſh to worldly pleaſures; but ſtill, beneath the dark and ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foliage, gleamed a wide extent of ocean, and many a paſſing ſail; while, to the right and left, thick woods were ſeen ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along the winding ſhores. So much as this had been admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, perhaps, to give to the ſecluded votary an image of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and viciſſitudes of life, and to conſole him, now that he had renounced its pleaſures, by the certainty of having eſcaped its evils. As Emily walked penſively along, conſidering how much ſuffering ſhe might have eſcaped, had ſhe become a votareſs of the order, and remained in this retirement from the time of
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:029378_0327_0FE089518044F840"/>
her father's death, the veſper bell ſtruck up, and the monks retired ſlowly towards the chapel, while ſhe, purſuing her way, entered the great hall, where an unuſual ſilence ſeemed to reign. The parlour too, which opened from it, ſhe found vacant, but, as the evening bell was ſounding, ſhe believed the nuns had withdrawn into the chapel, and ſat down to reſt, for a moment, before ſhe returned to the chateau, where, however, the increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gloom made her now anxious to be.</p>
                     <p>Not many minutes had elapſed, before a nun, entering in haſte, inquired for the abbeſs, and was retiring, without recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting Emily, when ſhe made herſelf known, and then learned, that a maſs was going to be performed for the ſoul of ſiſter Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, who had been declining for ſometime, and who was now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to be dying.</p>
                     <p>Of her ſufferings the ſiſter gave a melancholy account, and of the horrors into which ſhe had frequently ſtarted, but which had now yielded to a dejection ſo gloomy, that neither the prayers, in which ſhe was joined by the ſiſterhood, or the aſſurances of her confeſſor, had power to recall her from it, or to cheer her mind even with a momentary gleam of comfort.</p>
                     <p>To this relation Emily liſtened with extreme concern, and, recollecting the phrenſied manners and the expreſſions of horror, which ſhe had herſelf witneſſed of Agnes, together, with the hiſtory, that ſiſter Frances had communicated, her compaſſion was heightened to a very painful degree. As the evening was already far advanced, Emily did not now deſire to ſee her, or to join in the maſs, and, after leaving many kind remembrances with the nun, for her old friends, ſhe quitted the monaſtery, and returned over the cliffs towards the chateau, meditating upon what ſhe had juſt heard, till at length, ſhe forced her mind upon leſs intereſting ſubjects.</p>
                     <p>The wind was high, and, as ſhe drew near the chateau, ſhe often pauſed to liſten to its awful ſound, as it ſwept over the billows, that beat below, or groaned along the ſurrounding woods; and, while ſhe reſted on a cliff at a ſhort diſtance from the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau, and looked upon the the wide waters, ſeen dimly beneath the laſt ſhade of twilight, ſhe thought of the following addreſs,</p>

                     <p>ON the following evening, the view of the convent towers, riſing among the ſhadowy woods, reminded Emily of the nun, whoſe condition had ſo much affected her; and, anxious to know how ſhe was, as well as to ſee ſome of her former friends, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

At the gate ſtood a carriage, which, from the heat of the horſes, appeared to have juſt arrived; but a more than common ſtill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs pervaded the court and the cloiſters, through which Emily and Blanche paſſed in their way to the great hall, where a nun, who was croſſing to the ſtaircaſe, replied to the inquiries of the former, that ſiſter Agnes was ſtill living, and ſenſible, but that it was thought ſhe could not ſurvive the night. In the parlour, they found ſeveral of the boarders, who rejoiced to ſee Emily, and told her many little circumſtances that had happened in the convent ſince her departure, and which were intereſting to her only becauſe they related to perſons, whom ſhe had regarded with affection. While they thus converſed, the abbeſs entered the room, and expreſſed much ſatisfaction at ſeeing Emily, but her manner was unuſually ſolemn, and her countenance dejected.

"Our houſe," ſaid ſhe, after the firſt ſalutations were over, "is truly a houſe of mourning, a daughter is now paying the debt of nature. You have heard, perhaps that our daughter Agnes is dying?"</p>
                     <p>Emily expreſſed her ſincere concern.</p>
                     <p>"Her death preſents to us a great and awful leſſon," contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the abbeſs; "let us read it, and profit by it; let it teach us to prepare ourſelves for the change, that awaits us all! You are young, and have it yet in your power to ſecure "the peace that paſſeth all underſtanding"—the peace of conſcience. Preſerve it in your youth, that it may comfort you in age; for vain, alas! and imperfect are the good deeds of our latter years, if thoſe of our early life have been evil!"</p>
                     <p>Emily would have ſaid, that good deeds ſhe hoped, were never vain! but ſhe conſidered that it was the abbeſs who ſpoke, and ſhe remained ſilent.</p>
                     <p>"The latter days of Agnes," reſumed the abbeſs, "have been exemplary; would they might atone for the errors of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ones! Her ſufferings now, alas! are great; let us believe, that they will make her peace hereafter! I have left her with her confeſſor, and a gentleman, whom ſhe has long been anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to ſee, and who is juſt arrived from Paris. They, I hope, will be able to adminiſter the repoſe, which her mind has hitherto wanted."</p>
                     <p>Emily fervently joined in the wiſh.</p>
                     <p>"During her illneſs, ſhe has ſometimes named you," reſumed the abbeſs; "perhaps, it would comfort her to ſee you; when her preſent viſitors have left her, we will go to her chamber, if the ſcene will not be too melancholy for your ſpirits. But, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to ſuch ſcenes, however painful, we ought to accuſtom our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for they are ſalutary to the ſoul, and prepare us for what we are ourſelves to ſuffer."</p>
                     <p>Emily became grave and thoughtful; for this converſation bro't to her recollection the dying moments of her beloved father, and ſhe wiſhed once more to weep over the ſpot, where his remains were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. During the ſilence, which followed the abbeſs' ſpeech, many minute circumſtances attending his laſt hours occurred to her; his emotion on perceiving himſelf to be in the neighbourhood of Chateau-la-Blanc—his requeſt to be interred in a particular ſpot in the church of this monaſtery—and the ſolemn charge he had delivered her to deſtroy certain papers, without examining them. She recollected alſo the myſterious and horrible words in thoſe manuſcripts, upon which her eye had involuntarily glanced; and, though they now, and, indeed, whenever ſhe remembered them,
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:029378_0329_0FE08879E71687E0"/>
revived an exceſs of painful curioſity, concerning their full im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and the motives for her father's command, it was ever her chief conſolation, that ſhe had ſtrictly obeyed him in this particular.</p>
                     <p>Little more was ſaid by the abbeſs, who appeared too much affected by the ſubject ſhe had lately left, to be willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and her companions had been for ſometime ſilent from the ſame cauſe, when this general reverie was interrupted by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of a ſtranger, Monſieur Bonnac, who had juſt quitted the chamber of ſiſter Agnes. He appeared much diſturbed, but Emily fancied, that his countenance had more the expreſſion of horror, than of grief. Having drawn the abbeſs to a diſtant part of the room, he converſed with her for ſometime, during which ſhe ſeemed to liſten with earneſt attention, and he to ſpeak with caution, and a more than common degree of intereſt. When he had concluded, he bowed ſilently to the reſt of the company, and quitted the room. The abbeſs, ſoon after propoſed going to the chamber of ſiſter Agnes, to which Emily conſented, though not without ſome reluctance, and Lady Blanche remained with the boarders below.</p>
                     <p>At the door of the chamber they met the confeſſor, whom, as he lifted up his head on their approach, Emily obſerved to be the ſame that had attended her dying father; but he paſſed on without noticing her, and they entered the apartment, where, on a mattreſs, was laid ſiſter Agnes, with one nun watching in the chair beſide her. Her countenance was ſo much changed, that Emily would ſcarcely have recollected her, had ſhe not been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to do ſo: it was ghaſtly, and overſpread with gloomy horror; her dim and hollow eyes were fixed on a crucifix, which ſhe held upon her boſom: and ſhe was ſo much engaged in thought, as not to perceive the abbeſs and Emily, till they ſtood at the bed ſide. Then, turning her heavy eyes, ſhe fixed them in wild horror, upon Emily; and, ſcreaming, exclaimed, "Ah! that viſion comes upon me in my dying hours!"</p>
                     <p>Emily ſtarted back in terror, and looked for explanation to the abbeſs, who made her a ſignal not to be alarmed, and calmly ſaid to Agnes, "Daughter, I have brought Mademoiſelle St. Aubert to viſit you: I thought you would be glad to ſee her."</p>
                     <p>Agnes made no reply; but, ſtill gazing wildly upon Emily, exclaimed, "It is her very ſelf! Oh! there is all that faſcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in her look, which proved my deſtruction! What would you have—what is it you come to demand—Retribution?—It will ſoon be yours—it is yours already. How many years have paſſed, ſince laſt I ſaw you! My crime is but as yeſterday. Yet I am grown old beneath it; while you are ſtill young and
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:029378_0329_0FE08879E71687E0"/>
blooming—blooming as when you forced me to commit that moſt abhorred deed! O! could I once forget it!—yet what would that avail?—the deed is done!"</p>
                     <p>Emily, extremely ſhocked, would now have left the room; but the abbeſs, taking her hand, tried to ſupport her ſpirits, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſhe would ſtay a few moments, when Agnes would probably be calm, whom now ſhe tried to ſooth. But the latter ſeemed to diſregard her, while ſhe ſtill fixed her eyes on Emily, and added, "What are years of prayers and repentance? they cannot waſh out the foulneſs of murder!—Yes, murder! Where is he—where is he?—Look there—look there!—ſee where he ſtalks along the room! Why do you come to torment me now?" con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Agnes, while her ſtraining eyes were bent on air, "why was not I puniſhed before?—O! do not frown ſo ſternly I Hah I there again! 'tis ſhe herſelf! Why do you look ſo piteouſly upon me—and ſmile, too? ſmile on me! What groan was that?"</p>
                     <p>Agnes, ſunk down, apparently lifeleſs, and Emily, unable to ſupport herſelf, leaned againſt the bed, while the abbeſs and the attendant nun were applying the uſual remedies to Agnes. "Peace," ſaid the abbeſs, when Emily was going to ſpeak, "the delirium is going off, ſhe will ſoon revive. When was ſhe thus before, daughter?"</p>
                     <p>"Not for many weeks, madam," replied the nun, "but her ſpirits have been much agitated by the arrival of the gentleman ſhe wiſhed ſo much to ſee."</p>
                     <p>"Yes," obſerved the abbeſs," that has undoubtedly occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this paroxyſm of phrenzy. When ſhe is better, we will leave her to repoſe."</p>
                     <p>Emily very readily conſented, but, though ſhe could now give little aſſiſtance, ſhe was unwilling to quit the chamber, while any might be neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>When Agnes recovered her ſenſes, ſhe again fixed her eyes on Emily, but their wild expreſſion was gone, and a gloomy mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholy had ſucceeded. It was ſome moments before ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered ſufficient ſpirits to ſpeak; ſhe then ſaid feebly—"The likeneſs is wonderful!—ſurely it muſt be ſomething more than fancy. Tell me, I conjure you," ſhe added, addreſſing Emily, "though your name is St. Aubert, are you not the daughter of the Marchioneſs?"</p>
                     <p>"What Marchioneſs?" ſaid Emily, in extreme ſurpriſe; for, ſhe had imagined, from the calmneſs of Agnes' manner, that her intellects were reſtored. The abbeſs gave her a ſignificant glance, but ſhe repeated the queſtion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="206" facs="unknown:029378_0330_0FE08889CD49A068"/>
"What Marchioneſs?" exclaimed Agnes, "I know but of one, the Marchioneſs de Villeroi."</p>
                     <p>Emily, remembering the emotion of her late father, upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected mention of this lady, and his requeſt to be laid near the tomb of the Villerois, now felt greatly intereſted, and ſhe entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Agnes to explain the reaſon of her queſtion. The abbeſs would now have withdrawn Emily from the room, who being however, detained by a ſtrong intereſt, repeated her intreaties.</p>
                     <p>"Bring me that caſket, ſiſter," ſaid Agnes; "I will ſhew her to you; yet you need only look in that mirror, and you will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold her; you ſurely are her daughter; ſuch ſtriking reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance is never found but among <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> relations."</p>
                     <p>The nun brought the caſket, and Agnes, having directed her how to unlock it, ſhe took thence a miniature, in which Emily perceived the exact reſemblance of the picture, which ſhe had found among her late father's papers. Agnes held out her hand to receive it; gazed upon it earneſtly for ſome moments in ſilence; and then, with a countenance of deep deſpair, threw up her eyes to heaven, and prayed inwardly. When ſhe had finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhe returned the miniature to Emily. "Keep it, "ſaid ſhe "I bequeath it to you, for I muſt believe it is your right. I have frequently obſerved the reſemblance between you; but never, till this day, did it ſtrike upon my conſcience ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully! Stay, ſiſter, do not remove the caſket—there is another picture I would ſhew."</p>
                     <p>Emily trembled with expectation, and the abbeſs again would have withdrawn her. "Agnes is ſtill diſordered," ſaid ſhe, "you obſerve how ſhe wanders. In theſe moods ſhe ſays any thing, and does not ſcruple, as you have witneſſed, to accuſe herſelf of the moſt horrible crimes."</p>
                     <p>Emily, however, thought ſhe perceived ſomething more than madneſs in the inconſiſtencies of Agnes, whoſe mention of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs, and production of her picture, had intereſted her ſo much, that ſhe determined to obtain further information, if poſſible, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the ſubject of it.</p>
                     <p>The nun returned with the caſket, and, Agnes pointing out to her a ſecret drawer, ſhe took from it another miniature. "Here," ſaid Agnes, as ſhe offered it to Emily, "learn a leſſon for your vanity, at leaſt; look well at this picture, and ſee if you can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover any reſemblance between what I was, and what I am."</p>
                     <p>Emily impatiently received the miniature, which her eyes had ſcarcely glanced upon, before her trembling hands had nearly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered it to fall—it was the reſemblance of the portrait of Signora Laurentini, which ſhe had formerly ſeen in the caſtle of Udolpho,
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:029378_0330_0FE08889CD49A068"/>
the lady, who had diſappeared in ſo myſterious a manner, and whom Montoni had been ſuſpected of having cauſed to be murdered.</p>
                     <p>In ſilent aſtoniſhment, Emily continued to gaze alternately upon the picture and the dying nun, endeavouring to trace a reſemblance between them, which no longer exiſted.</p>
                     <p>"Why do you look ſo ſternly on me?" ſaid Agnes, miſtaking the nature of Emily's emotion.</p>
                     <p>"I have ſeen this face before," ſaid Emily, at length; "was it really your reſemblance?"</p>
                     <p>"You may well aſk that queſtion," replied the nun,—but it was once eſteemed a ſtriking likeneſs of me. Look at me well, and ſee what guilt has made me. I then was innocent; the evil paſſions of my nature ſlept. Siſter!" added ſhe, ſolemnly, and ſtretching forth her cold, damp hand to Emily, who ſhuddered at its touch—"Siſter! beware of the firſt indulgence of the paſſions; beware of the firſt! Their courſe, if not checked then, is rapid—their force is uncontroulable—they lead us we know not whither, they lead us perhaps to the commiſſion of crimes, for which whole years of prayer and penitence cannot atone!—Such may be the force of even a ſingle paſſion, that it overcomes every other, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ears up every other approach to the heart. Poſſeſſing us like a fiend, it leads us on to the acts of a fiend, making us inſenſible to pity and to conſcience. And, when its purpoſe is accompliſhed, like a fiend, it leaves us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o the torture of thoſe feelings, which its power had ſuſpended—not annihilated,—to the tortures of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, remorſe, and conſcience. Then, we awaken as from a dream, and perceive a new world around us—we gaze in aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and horror—but the deed is committed; not all the powers of heaven and earth united can undo it—and the ſpectres of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will not fly! What are riches—grandeur—health itſelf, to the luxury of a pure conſcience, the health of the ſoul; and what the ſufferings of poverty, diſappointment, deſpair—to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of an afflicted one! O! how long is it ſince I knew that luxury! I believed, that I had ſuffered the moſt agonizing pangs of human nature, in love, jealouſy and deſpair; but theſe pangs were eaſe, compared with the ſtings of conſcience, which I have ſince endured. I taſted too, what was called the ſweet of revenge, but it was tranſient, it expired even with the object, that provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. Remember, ſiſter, that the paſſions are the ſeeds of vices as well as of virtues, from which either may ſpring, accordingly as they are nurtured. Unhappy they who have never been taught the art to govern them!"</p>
                     <p>"Alas! unhappy!" ſaid the abbeſs," and ill informed of our holy religion!" Emily liſtened to Agnes, in ſilent awe, while
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:029378_0331_0FE0888EA8DF70A0"/>
ſhe ſtill examined the miniature, and became confirmed in her opinion of its ſtrong reſemblance to the portrait at Udolpho.—"This face is familiar to me," ſaid ſhe, wiſhing to lead the nun to an explanation, yet fearing to diſcover too abruptly her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Udolpho.</p>
                     <p>"You are miſtaken," replied Agnes, "you certainly never ſaw that picture before."</p>
                     <p>"No," replied Emily, "but I have ſeen one extremely like it." "Impoſſible," ſaid Agnes, who may now be called the Lady Laurentini.</p>
                     <p>"It was in the caſtle of Udolpho," continued Emily, looking ſtedfaſtly at her.</p>
                     <p>"Of Udolpho!" exclaimed Laurentini, "of Udolpho in Italy!" "The ſame" replied Emily.</p>
                     <p>"You know me then," ſaid Laurentini, "and you are the daughter of the Marchioneſs." Emily was ſomewhat ſurpriſed at this abrupt aſſertion. I am the daughter of the late Monſ. St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert," ſaid ſhe; "and the lady you name is an utter ſtranger to me."</p>
                     <p>"At leaſt you believe ſo," rejoined Laurentini.</p>
                     <p>Emily aſked what reaſons there could be to believe otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>"The family likeneſs, that you bear her," ſaid the nun. "The Marchioneſs, it is known, was attached to a gentleman of Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cony, at the time when ſhe accepted the hand of the Marquis, by the command of her father. Ill fated, unhappy woman!"</p>
                     <p>Emily remembering the extreme emotion which St. Aubert had betrayed on the mention of the Marchioneſs, would now have ſuffered ſomething more than ſurpriſe had her confidence in his integrity been leſs; as it was, ſhe could not, for a moment, believe what the words of Laurentini inſinuated; yet ſhe ſtill felt ſtrongly intereſted, concerning them, and begged, that ſhe would explain them further.</p>
                     <p>"Do not urge me on that ſubject," ſaid the nun, "it is to me a terrible one! Would that I could blot it from my memory!" She ſighed deeply, and, after the pauſe of a moment, aſked Emily, by what means ſhe had diſcovered her name?</p>
                     <p>"By your portrait in the caſtle of Udolpho, to which this miniature bears a ſtriking reſemblance," replied Emily.</p>
                     <p>"You have been at Udolpho then!" ſaid the nun, with great emotion. "Alas! what ſcenes does the mention of it revive in my fancy—ſcenes of happineſs, of ſufferings, and of horror!"</p>
                     <p>At this moment, the terrible ſpectacle, which Emily had wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed in a chamber of that caſtle, occurred to her, and ſhe ſhud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, while ſhe looked upon the nun—and recollected her
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:029378_0331_0FE0888EA8DF70A0"/>
late words—that "years of prayer and penitence could not waſh out the foulneſs of murder." She was now compelled to attribute theſe to another cauſe, than that of delirium. With a degree of horror, that almoſt deprived her of ſenſe, ſhe now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved ſhe looked upon a murderer; all the recollected behaviour of Laurentini ſeemed to confirm the ſuppoſition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet Emily was ſtill loſt in a labyrinth of perplexities, and, not knowing how to aſk the queſtions, which might lead to truth, ſhe could only hint them in broken ſentences.</p>
                     <p>"Your ſudden departure from Udolpho"—ſaid ſhe.</p>
                     <p>Laurentini groaned.</p>
                     <p>"The reports that followed it," continued Emily—"The weſt chamber—the mourning veil—the object it conceals—when mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are committed—"</p>
                     <p>The nun ſhrieked, "What! there again!" ſaid ſhe, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to raiſe herſelf, while her ſtarting eyes ſeemed to follow ſome object round the room—" Come from the grave! What! Blood—blood too!—There was no blood—thou can'ſt not ſay it!—Nay, do not ſmile,—do not ſmile ſo piteouſly!"</p>
                     <p>Laurentini fell into convulſions, as ſhe uttered the laſt words; and Emily, unable any longer to endure the horror of the ſcene, hurried from the room, and ſent ſome nuns to the aſſiſtance of the abbeſs.</p>
                     <p>The Lady Blanche, and the boarders, who were in the parlour, now aſſembled round Emily, and, alarmed by her manner and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted countenance, aſked a hundred queſtions, which ſhe avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed anſwering further, than by ſaying, that ſhe believed ſiſter Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes was dying. They received this as a ſufficient explanation of her terror, and had then leiſure to offer reſtoratives, which, at length, ſomewhat revived Emily, whoſe mind was, however, ſo much ſhocked with terrible ſurmiſes, and perplexed with doubts by ſome words from the nun, that ſhe was unable to converſe, and would have left the convent immediately, had ſhe not wiſhed to know whether Laurentini would ſurvive the late attack. After waiting ſometime, ſhe was informed, that, the convulſions having ceaſed, Laurentini ſeemed to be reviving, and Emily and Blanche were departing, when the abbeſs appeared, who, drawing the former aſide, ſaid ſhe had ſomething of conſequence to ſay to her, but, as it was late, ſhe would not detain her then, and requeſted to ſee her on the following day.</p>
                     <p>Emily promiſed to viſit her, and, having taken leave, returned with the Lady Blanche towards the chateau, on the way to which the deep gloom of the woods made Blanche lament, that the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:029378_0332_0FE0889D731ED678"/>
was ſo far advanced; for the ſurrounding ſtillneſs and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity rendered her ſenſible of fear, though there was a ſervant to protect her; while Emily was too much engaged by the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the ſcene ſhe had juſt witneſſed, to be affected by the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of the ſhades, otherwiſe, than as they ſerved to promote her gloomy reverie, from which, however, ſhe was at length re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called by the Lady Blanche, who pointed out, at ſome diſtance, in the duſky path they were winding two perſons ſlowly advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It was impoſſible to avoid them without ſtriking into a ſtill more ſecluded part of the wood, whither the ſtrangers might eaſily follow; but all apprehenſion vaniſhed, when Emily diſtinguiſhed the voice of Monſ. Du Pont, and perceived, that his companion was the gentleman, whom ſhe had ſeen at the monaſtery, and who was now converſing with ſo much earneſtneſs as not immediately to perceive their approach. When Du Pont joined the ladies, the ſtranger took leave, and they proceeded to the chateau, where the Count, when he heard of Monſ. Bonnac, claimed him for an acquaintance, and, on learning the melancholy occaſion of his viſit to Languedoc, and that he was lodged at a ſmall inn in the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, begged the favour of Monſ. Du Pont to invite him to the chateau.</p>
                     <p>The latter was happy to do ſo, and the ſcruples of reſerve, which made M. Bonnac heſitate to accept the invitation, being at length overcome, they went to the chateau, where the kindneſs of the Count and the ſprightlineſs of his ſon were exerted to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipate the gloom that overhung the ſpirits of the ſtranger. M. Bonnac was an officer in the French ſervice, and appeared to be about fifty; his figure was tall and commanding, his manners had received the laſt poliſh, and there was ſomething in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance uncommonly intereſting; for over features, which in youth, muſt have been remarkably handſome, was ſpread a mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholy, that ſeemed the effect of long misfortune, rather than of conſtitution or temper.</p>
                     <p>The converſation he held, during ſupper, was evidently an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of politeneſs, and there were intervals in which, unable to ſtruggle againſt the feelings, that depreſſed him, he relapſed into ſilence and abſtraction, from which, however, the Count, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times withdrew him in a manner ſo delicate and benevolent, that Emily, while ſhe obſerved him, almoſt fancied ſhe beheld her late father.</p>
                     <p>The party ſeparated at an early hour, and then, in the ſolitude of her apartment, the ſcenes, which Emily had lately witneſſed, returned to her fancy, with dreadful energy. That in the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

nun ſhe ſhould have diſcovered Signora Laurentini, who, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of having been murdered by Montoni, was, as it now ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, herſelf guilty of ſome dreadful crime, excited both horror and ſurpriſe in a high degree: nor did the hints, which ſhe had dropped, reſpecting the marriage of the Marchioneſs de Villeroi, and the inquiries ſhe had made concerning Emily's birth, occaſion her a leſs degree of intereſt, though it was of a different nature.</p>
                     <p>The hiſtory, which ſiſter Frances had formerly related, and had ſaid to be that of Agnes, it now appeared, was erroneous; but for what purpoſe it had been fabricated, unleſs the more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to conceal the true ſtory, Emily could not even gueſs. Above all, her intereſt was excited as to the relation, which the ſtory of the late Marchioneſs de Villeroi bore to that of her father; for, that ſome kind of relation exiſted between them, the grief of St. Aubert, upon hearing her named, his requeſt to be buried near her, and her picture, which had been found among his papers, certainly proved. Sometimes it occurred to Emily, that he might have been the lover to whom it was ſaid the Marchioneſs was attached, when ſhe was compelled to marry the Marquis de Villeroi; but that he had afterwards cheriſhed a paſſion for her, ſhe could not ſuffer herſelf to believe, for a moment. The papers, which he had ſo ſolemnly enjoined her to deſtroy, ſhe now fancied had related to this connection, and ſhe wiſhed more earneſtly than before to know the reaſons, that made him conſider the injunction neceſſary, which, had her faith in his principles been leſs, would have led to believe, that there was a myſtery in her birth diſhonourable to her parents, which thoſe manuſcripts might have revealed.</p>
                     <p>Reflections, ſimilar to theſe, engaged her mind, during the greater part of the night, and when, at length, ſhe fell into a ſlumber, it was only to behold a viſion of the dying nun, and to awaken in horrors, like thoſe ſhe had witneſſed.</p>
                     <p>On the following morning, ſhe was too much indiſpoſed to attend her appointment with the abbeſs, and, before the day con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, ſhe heard, that ſiſter Agnes was no more. Monſ. Bonnac received this intelligence, with concern; but Emily obſerved, that he did not appear ſo much affected now, as on the preceding evening, immediately after quitting the apartment, of the nun, whoſe death was probably leſs terrible to him, than the confeſſion he had been then called upon to witneſs. However this might be, he was perhaps conſoled, in ſome degree, by a knowledge of the legacy bequeathed him, ſince his family was large, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance of ſome part of it had lately been the means of involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in great diſtreſs, and even in the horrors, of a priſon; <gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">

dered her beauty more enchanting, if poſſible, to his fancy, than it had ever yet appeared. Experience had taught him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the full value of the qualities, which he had before admired, but which the contraſted characters he had ſeen in the world made him now adore; and theſe reflections, increaſing the pangs of remorſe and regret, occaſioned the deep dejection, that had accompanied him even into the preſence of Emily, of whom he conſidered himſelf no longer worthy. To the ignominy of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received pecuniary obligations from the Marchioneſs Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, or any other lady of intrigue, as the Count De Villefort had been informed, or of having been engaged in the depredat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſchemes of gameſters, Valancourt had never ſubmitted; and theſe were ſome of ſuch ſcandals as often mingle with truth, againſt the unfortunate. Count De Villefort had received them from authority, which he had no reaſon to doubt, and which the imprudent conduct he had himſelf witneſſed in Valancourt, had certainly induced him the more readily to believe. Being ſuch as Emily could not name to the Chevalier, he had no opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of refuting them; and, when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e confeſſed himſelf to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of her eſteem, he little ſuſpected, that he was confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her the moſt dreadful calumnies. Thus the miſtake had been mutual, and had remained ſo, when Monſ. Bonnac explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the conduct of his generous, but imprudent young friend to Du Pont, who, with ſevere juſtice, determined not only to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive the Count on this ſubject, but to reſign all hope of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Such a ſacrifice as his love rendered this, was deſerving of a noble reward, and Monſ. Bonnac, if it had been poſſible for him to forget the benevolent Valancourt, would have wiſhed that Emily might accept the juſt Du Pont.</p>
                     <p>When the Count was informed of the error he had committed, he was extremely ſhocked at the conſequence of his credulity, and the account which Monſ. Bonnac gave of his friend's ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, while at Paris, convinced him, that Valancourt had been entrapped by the ſchemes of a ſet of diſſipated young men, with whom his profeſſion had partly obliged him to aſſociate, rather than by an inclination to vice; and, charmed by the humanity, and noble, though raſh generoſity, which his conduct towards Monſ. Bonnac exhibited, he forgave him the tranſient errors, that had ſtained his youth, and reſtored him to the high degree of eſteem, with which he had regarded him, during their early ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. But, as the leaſt reparation he could now make Valancourt was to afford him an opportunity of explaining to Emily his former conduct, he immediately wrote, to requeſt his

forgiveneſs of the unintentional injury he had done him, and to invite him to Chateau-le-Blanc. Motives of delicacy withheld the Count from informing Emily of this letter, and of kindneſs from acquainting her with the diſcovery reſpecting Valancourt, till his arrival ſhould ſave her from the poſſibility of anxiety, as to its event; and this precaution ſpared her even ſeverer inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etude, than the Count had foreſeen, ſince he was ignorant of the ſymptoms of deſpair, which Valancourt's late conduct had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed.</p>

                     <p>SOME circumſtances of an extraordinary nature now with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Emily from her own ſorrows, and excited emotions, which partook of both ſurpriſe and horror.</p>
                     <p>A few days following that, on which Signora Laurentini died, her will was opened at the monaſtery, in the preſence of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors and Monſ. Bonnac, when it was found, that one third of her perſonal property was bequeathed to the neareſt ſurviving re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative of the late Marchioneſs de Villeroi, and that Emily was the perſon.</p>
                     <p>With the ſecret of Emily's family the abbeſs had long been acquainted, and it was in obſervance of the earneſt requeſt of St. Aubert, who was known to the friar, that attended him on his death bed, that his daughter had remained in ignorance of her relationſhip to the Marchioneſs. But ſome hints, which had fallen from Signora Laurentini, during her laſt interview with Emily, and a confeſſion of a very extraordinary nature, given in her dying hours, had made the abbeſs think it neceſſary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with her young friend, on the topic ſhe had not before ventured to introduce; and it was for this purpoſe, that ſhe had requeſted to ſee her on the morning that followed her interview with the nun. Emily's indiſpoſition had then prevented the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended converſation; but now, after the will had been examined,

ſhe received a ſummons, which ſhe immediately obeyed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came informed of circumſtances, that powerfully affected her. As the narrative of the abbeſs was, however, deficient in many particulars, of which the reader may wiſh to be informed, and the hiſtory of the nun is materially connected with the fate of the Marchioneſs de Villeroi, we ſhall omit the converſation, that paſſed in the parlour of the convent, and mingle with out rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a brief hiſtory of
LAURENTINI DI UDOLPHO,</p>
                     <p>Who was the only child of her parents, and heireſs of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient houſe of Udolpho, in the territory of Venice. It was the firſt misfortune of her life, and that which led to all her ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding miſery, that the friends who ought to have reſtrained her ſtrong paſſions, and mildly inſtructed her in the art of gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erning them, nurtured them by early indulgence. But they cheriſhed their own failings in her; for their conduct was not the reſult of rational kindneſs, and, when they either indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> oppoſed the paſſions of their child, they gratified their own. Thus they indulged her with weakneſs, and reprehended her with violence, her ſpirit was exaſperated by their vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence, inſtead of being corrected by their wiſdom; and their oppoſitions became conteſts for victory, in which the due tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the parents, and the affectionate duties of the child, were equally forgotten; but, as returning fondneſs diſarmed the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent's reſentment ſooneſt, Laurentini was ſuffered to believe that ſhe had conquered, and her paſſions became ſtronger by every effort, that had been employed to ſubdue them.</p>
                     <p>The death of her father and mother in the ſame year left her to her own diſcretion, under the dangerous circumſtances attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant on youth and beauty. She was fond of company, delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with admiration, yet diſdainful of the opinion of the world, when it happened to contradict her inclinations; had a gay and brilliant wit, and was miſtreſs of all the arts of faſcination. Her conduct was ſuch as might have been expected, from the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her principles and the ſtrength of her paſſions.</p>
                     <p>Among her numerous admirers was the late Marquis de Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leroi, who, on his tour through Italy, ſaw Laurentini at Venice, where ſhe uſually reſided, and became her paſſionate adorer. Equally captivated by the figure and accompliſhments of the Marquis, who was at that period one of the moſt diſtinguiſhed noblemen of the French court, ſhe had art ſo effectually to
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:029378_0335_0FE088B800FBD4C0"/>
conceal from him the dangerous traits of her character and the blemiſhes of her late conduct, that he ſolicited her hand in marriage.</p>
                     <p>Before the nuptials were concluded, ſhe retired to the caſtle of Udolpho, whither the Marquis followed, and, where her conduct relaxing from the propriety, which ſhe had lately aſſumed, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to him the precipice, on which he ſtood. A minuter, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry than he had before thought it neceſſary to make, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced him, that he had been deceived in her character, and ſhe, whom he had deſigned for his wife, afterwards became his miſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>Having paſſed ſome weeks at Udolpho, he was called abruptly to France, whither he returned with extreme reluctance, for his heart was ſtill faſcinated by the arts of Laurentini, with whom, however, he had, on various pretences, delayed his marriage; but, to reconcile her to this ſeparation, he now gave repeated promiſes of returning to conclude the nuptials, as ſoon as the affair, which thus ſuddenly called him to France, ſhould permit.</p>
                     <p>Soothed, in ſome degree, by theſe aſſurances, ſhe ſuffered him to depart; and, ſoon after, her relative, Montoni, arriving at Udolpho, renewed the addreſſes, which ſhe had before refuſed, and which ſhe now again rejected. Meanwhile, her thoughts were conſtantly with the Marquis de Villeroi, for whom ſhe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered all the delirium of Italian love, cheriſhed by the ſolitude, to which ſhe confined herſelf; for ſhe had now loſt all taſte for the pleaſures of ſociety and the gaiety of amuſement. Her only indulgences were to ſigh and weep over a miniature of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis; to viſit the ſcenes, that had witneſſed their happineſs, to pour forth her heart to him in writing, and to count the weeks, the days, which muſt intervene before the period that he had mentioned as probable for his return. But this period p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſſed without bringing him; and week after week followed in heavy and almoſt intolerable expectation. During this interval, Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentini's fancy, occupied inceſſantly by one idea, became diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; and, her whole heart being devoted to one object, life became hateful to her, when ſhe believed that object loſt.</p>
                     <p>Several months paſſed, during which ſhe heard nothing from the Marquis de Villeroi, and her days were marked, at intervals, with the phrenſy of paſſion and the ſullenneſs of deſpair. She ſecluded herſelf from all viſitors, and, ſometimes, remained in her apartment, for weeks together, refuſing to ſpeak to every perſon, except her favourite female attendant, writing ſcraps of letters, reading, again and again, thoſe ſhe had received from the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis, weeping over his picture, and ſpeaking to it, for many hours, upbraiding, reproaching and careſſing it alternately.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="218" facs="unknown:029378_0336_0FE088C38ABD0600"/>
At length, a report reached her, that the Marquis had married in France, and, after ſuffering all the extremes of love, jealouſy and indignation, ſhe formed the deſperate reſolution of going ſecretly to that country, and, if the report proved true, of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting a deep revenge. To her favourite woman only ſhe confided the plan of her journey, and ſhe engaged her to partake of it. Having collected her jewels, which, deſcending to her from many branches of her family, were of immenſe value, and all her caſh, to a very large amount, they were packed in a trunk, which was privately conveyed to a neighbouring town, whither Laurentini, with this only ſervant, followed, and thence proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſecretly to Leghorn, where they embarked for France.</p>
                     <p>When, on her arrival in Languedoc, ſhe found, that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis de Villeroi had been married for ſome months, her deſpair almoſt deprived her of reaſon, and ſhe alternately projected and abandoned the horrible deſign of murdering the Marquis, his wife and herſelf. At length ſhe contrived to throw herſelf in his way, with an intention of reproaching him, for his conduct, and of ſlabbing herſelf in his preſence; but, when ſhe again ſaw him, who ſo long had been the conſtant object of her thoughts and affections, reſentment yielded to love; her reſolution failed; ſhe trembled with the conflict of emotions, that aſſailed her heart, and fainted away.</p>
                     <p>The Marquis was not proof againſt her beauty and ſenſibility; all the energy, with which he had firſt loved, returned, for his paſſion had been reſiſted by prudence, rather than overcome by indifference; and, ſince the honour of his family would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> ſo far ſucceeded, as to ſelect the then Marchioneſs for his wife, whom he loved at firſt with a tempered and rational af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. But the mild virtues of that amiable lady did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe him for her indifference, which appeared, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding her efforts to conceal it; and he had, for ſometime, ſuſpected that her affections were engaged by another perſon, when Laurentini arrived in Languedoc. This artful Italian ſoon perceived, that ſhe had regained her influence over him, and, ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the diſcovery, ſhe determined to live, and to employ all her enchantments to win his conſent to the diabolical deed, which ſhe believed was neceſſary to the ſecurity of her happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and, having completely eſtranged the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the Marquis from his wife, whoſe gentle goodneſs and unimpaſſioned manners had ceaſed to pleaſe, when contraſted
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:029378_0336_0FE088C38ABD0600"/>
with the captivations of the Italian, ſhe proceeded to awaken in his mind the jealouſy of pride, for it was no longer that of love, and even pointed out to him the perſon, to whom ſhe affirmed the Marchioneſs had ſacrificed her honour; but Laurentini had firſt extorted from him a ſolemn promiſe to forbear avenging himſelf upon his rival. This was an important part of her plan, for ſhe knew, that, if his deſire of vengeance was reſtrained to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one party, it would burn more fiercely towards the other, and he might then, perhaps, be prevailed on to aſſiſt in the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible act, which would releaſe him from the only barrier, that withheld him from making her his wife.</p>
                     <p>The innocent Marchioneſs, meanwhile, obſerved, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme grief, the alteration in her huſband's manners. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came reſerved and thoughtful in her preſence; his conduct was auſtere, and ſometimes even rude; and he left her, for many hours together, to weep for his unkindneſs, and to form plans for the recovery of his affection. His conduct afflicted her the more, becauſe, in obedience to the command of her father, ſhe had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted his hand, though her affections were engaged to another, whoſe amiable diſpoſition, ſhe had reaſon to believe, would have enſured her happineſs. This circumſtance Laurentini had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, ſoon after her arrival in France, and had made ample uſe of it in aſſiſting her deſigns upon the Marquis, to whom ſhe adduced ſuch ſeeming proof of his wife's infidelity, that, in the frantic rage of wounded honour, he conſented to deſtroy his wife. A ſlow poiſon was adminiſtered, and ſhe fell a victim to the jealouſy and ſubtlety of Laurentini and to the guilty weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her huſband.</p>
                     <p>But the moment of Laurentini's triumph, the moment, to which ſhe had looked forward for the completion of all her wiſhes, proved only the commencement of a ſuffering, that never left her to her dying hour.</p>
                     <p>The paſſion of revenge, which had in part ſtimulated her to the commiſſion of this atrocious deed, died, even at the moment when it was gratified, and left her to the horrors of unavailing pity and remorſe, which would probably have empoiſoned all the years ſhe had promiſed herſelf with the Marquis de Villeroi, had her expectations of an alliance with him been realized. But he, too, had found the moment of his revenge to be that of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, as to himſelf, and deteſtation, as to the partner of his crime; the feeling, which he had miſtaken for conviction, was no more; and he ſtood aſtoniſhed, and aghaſt, that no proof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained of his wife's infidelity now that ſhe had ſuffered the
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:029378_0337_0FE088C92D48F4E0"/>

                     <p>In the firſt horrors of remorſe and deſpair, he felt inclined to deliver up himſelf and the woman, who had plunged him into this abyſs of guilt, into the hands of juſtice; but, when the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oxyſm of his ſuffering was ever, his intention changed. Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentini, however, he ſaw only once afterwards, and that was, to curſe her as the inſtigator of his crime, and to ſay, that he ſpared her life only on condition, that ſhe paſſed the reſt of her days in prayer and penance. Overwhelmed with diſappointment, on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving contempt and abhorrence from the man, for whoſe ſake ſhe had not ſcrupled to ſtain her conſcience with human blood, and touched with horror of the unavailing crime ſhe had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, ſhe renounced the world, and retired to the monaſtery of St. Claire, a dreadful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

                        </gap>oſt intimate friends could not account, and he, at length, died, with a degree of horror nearly equal to that, which Laurentini had ſuffered. The phyſician, who had obſerved the ſingular appearance of the unfortunate Marchioneſs, after death, had been bribed to ſilence; and, as the ſurmiſes of a few of the ſervants had proceeded no further than a whiſper, the affair had never been inveſtigated. Whether this whiſper ever reached the father of the Marchioneſs, and, if it did, whether the difficulty of obtaining proof deterred him from proſecuting the Marquis de Villeroi, is uncertain; but her death was deeply lamented by ſome part of her family, and particularly by her brother, M. St. Aubert; for that was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of relationſhip, which had exiſted between Emily's father and the Marchioneſs; and there is no doubt, that he ſuſpected the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of her death. Many letters paſſed between the Marquis and him, ſoon after the deceaſe of his beloved ſiſter, the ſubject of which was not known, but there is reaſon to believe, that they related to the cauſe of her death; and theſe were the papers, together with ſome letters of the Marchioneſs, who had confided to her brother the occaſion of her unhappineſs, which St. Aubert had ſo ſolemnly enjoined his daughter to deſtroy: and anxiety
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:029378_0337_0FE088C92D48F4E0"/>
for her peace had probably made him forbid her to inquire into the melancholy ſtory, to which they alluded. Such, indeed, had been his affliction, on the premature death of this his favourite ſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whoſe unhappy marriage had from the firſt excited his tendereſt pity, that he never could hear her named, or mention her himſelf after her death, except to Madame St. Aubert. From Emily, whoſe ſenſibility he feared to awaken, he had ſo carefully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed her hiſtory and name, that ſhe was ignorant, till now, that ſhe ever had ſuch a relative as the Marchioneſs de Villeroi; and from this motive he had enjoined ſilence to his only ſurviving ſiſter, Madame Cheron, who had ſcrupulouſly obſerved his requeſt.</p>
                     <p>It was over ſome of the laſt pathetic letters of the Marchioneſs, that St. Aubert was weeping, when he was obſerved by Emily, on the eve of her departure from La Vallee, and it was her pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which he had ſo tenderly careſſed. Her diſaſtrous death may account for the emotion he had betrayed, on hearing her named by La Voiſin, and for his requeſt to be interred near the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Villerois, where her remains were depoſited, but not thoſe of her huſband, who was buried, where he died, in the north of France.</p>
                     <p>The confeſſor, who attended St. Aubert in his laſt moments, recollected him to be the brother of the late Marchioneſs, when St. Aubert, from tenderneſs to Emily, had conjured him to conceal the circumſtance, and to requeſt that the abbeſs, to whoſe care he particularly recommended her would do the ſame; a requeſt, which had been exactly obſerved.</p>
                     <p>Laurentini, on her arrival in France, had carefully concealed her name and family, and, the better to diſguiſe her real hiſtory, had, on entering the convent, cauſed the ſtory to be circulated, which had impoſed on ſiſter Frances, and it is probable, that the abbeſs, who did not preſide in the convent, at the time of her noviciation, was alſo entirely ignorant of the truth. The deep remorſe, that ſeized on the mind of Laurentini, together with the ſufferings of diſappointed paſſion, for ſhe ſtill loved the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis, again unſettled her intellects, and, after the firſt paroxyſms of deſpair were paſſed, a heavy and ſilent melancholy had ſettled upon her ſpirits, which ſuffered few interruptions from fits of phrenſy, till the time of her death. During many years it had been her only amuſement to walk in the woods near the monaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, in the ſolitary hours of night, and to play on a favourite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, to which ſhe ſometimes joined the delightful melody of her voice, in the moſt ſolemn and melancholy airs of her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive country, modulated by all the energetic feeling, that dwel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

in her heart. The phyſician, who had attended her, recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to the ſuperior to indulge her in this whim, as the only means of ſoothing her diſtempered fancy; and ſhe was ſuffered to walk in the lonely hours of night, attended by the ſervant, who had accompanied her from Italy; but, as the indulgence tranſgreſſed againſt the rules of the convent, it was kept as ſecret as poſſible; and thus the myſterious muſic of Laurentini had combined with other circumſtances, to produce a report, that not only the chateau, but its neighbourhood, was haunted.</p>
                     <p>Soon after her entrance into this holy community, and before ſhe had ſhewn any ſymptoms of inſanity there, ſhe made a will, in which, after bequeathing a conſiderable legacy to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, ſhe divided the remainder of her perſonal property, which her jewels made very valuable, between the wife of Monſ. Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nac, who was an Italian lady and her relation, and the neareſt ſurviving relative of the late Marchioneſs de Villeroi. As Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly St. Aubert was not only the neareſt, but the ſole relative, this legacy deſcended to her, and thus explained to her the whole myſtery of her father's conduct.</p>
                     <p>The reſemblance between Emily and her unfortunate aunt had frequently been obſerved by Laurentini, and had occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſingular behaviour, which had formerly alarmed her; but it was in the nun's dying hour, when her conſcience gave her perpetually the idea of the Marchioneſs, that ſhe became more ſenſible, than ever, of this likeneſs, and, in her phrenſy, deemed it no reſemblance of the perſon ſhe had injured, but the original herſelf. The bold aſſertion, that had followed, on the recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of her ſenſes, that Emily was the daughter of the Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs de Villeroi, aroſe from a ſuſpicion that ſhe was ſo; for, knowing that her rival, when ſhe married the Marquis, was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to another lover, ſhe had ſcarcely ſcrupled to believe, that her honour had been ſacrificed, like her own, to an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted paſſion.</p>
                     <p>Of a crime, however, to which Emily had ſuſpected, from her phrenſied confeſſion of murder, that ſhe had been inſtrumental in the caſtle of Udolpho, Laurentini was innocent; and ſhe had herſelf been deceived, concerning the ſpectacle, that formerly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned her ſo much terror, and had ſince compelled her, for a while, to attribute the horrors of the nun to a conſciouſneſs of a murder committed in that caſtle.</p>
                     <p>It may be remembered, that, in a chamber of Udolpho, hung a black veil, whoſe ſingular ſituation had excited Emily's curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and which afterwards diſcloſed an object, that had overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:029378_0338_0FE088DA34CE5F20"/>
her with horror; for, on lifting it, there appeared, inſtead of the picture ſhe had expected, within a receſs of the wall, a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man figure of ghaſtly paleneſs ſtretched at its length, and dreſſed in the habiliments of the grave. What added to the horror of the ſpectacle, was, that the face appeared partly decayed and disfigured by worms, which were viſible on the features and hands. On ſuch an object, it will be readily believed, that no perſon could endure to look twice. Emily, it may be recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, had, after the firſt glance, let the veil drop, and her ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror had prevented her from ever after provoking a renewal of ſuch ſuffering, as ſhe had then experienced. Had ſhe dared to look again, her deluſion and her fears would have vaniſhed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and ſhe would have perceived, that the figure before her was not human, but formed of wax. The hiſtory of it is ſome what extraordinary, though not without example in the records of that fierce ſeverity, which monkiſh ſuperſtition has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times inflicted on mankind. A member of the houſe of Udol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho, having committed ſome offence againſt the prerogative of the church, had been condemned to the penance of contemplating, during certain hours of the day, a waxen image, made to reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a human body in the ſtate, to which it is reduced after death. This penance, ſerving as a memento of the condition at which he muſt himſelf arrive, had been deſigned to reprove the pride of the Marquis of Udolpho, which had formerly ſo much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated that of the Romiſh church; and he had not only ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitiouſly obſerved this penance himſelf, which he had believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was to obtain a pardon for all his ſins, but had made it a condition in his will, that his deſcendants ſhould preſerve the image, on pain of forfeiting to the church a certain part of his domain, that they alſo might profit by the humiliating moral it conveyed. The figure therefore, had been ſuffered to retain its ſtation in the wall of the chamber, but his deſcendants excuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves from obſerving the penance, to which he had been enjoined.</p>
                     <p>This image was ſo horribly natural, that it is not ſurpriſing Emily ſhould have miſtaken it for the object it reſembled, nor, ſince ſhe had heard ſuch an extraordinary account, concerning the diſappearing of the late lady of the caſtle, and had ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the character of Montoni, that ſhe ſhould have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved this to be the murdered body of the lady Laurentini, and that he had been the contriver of her death.</p>
                     <p>The ſituation, in which ſhe had diſcovered it, occaſioned her, at firſt, much ſurpriſe and perplexity; but the vigilance, with
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:029378_0339_0FE088DECC12E588"/>
which the doors of the chamber, where it was depoſited, were afterwards ſecured, had compelled her to believe, that Montoni, not daring to confide the ſecret of her death to any perſon, had ſuffered her remains to decay in this obſcure chamber. The cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emony of the veil, however, and the circumſtance of the doors having been left open, even for a moment, had occaſioned her much wonder and ſome doubts; but theſe were not ſufficient to overcome her ſuſpicion of Montoni; and it was the dread of his terrible, vengeance, that had ſealed her lips in ſilence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning what ſhe had ſeen in the weſt chamber.</p>
                     <p>Emily, in diſcovering the Marchioneſs de Villeroi to have been the ſiſter of Monſ. St. Aubert, was variouſly affected; but, amidſt the ſorrow, which ſhe ſuffered for her untimely death, ſhe was releaſed from an anxious and painful conjecture, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the raſh aſſertion of Signora Laurentini, concerning her birth and the honour of her parents. Her faith in St. Aubert's principles would ſcarcely allow her to ſuſpect that he had acted diſhonourably, and ſhe felt ſuch reluctance to believe herſelf the daughter of any other, than her, whom ſhe had always conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and loved as a mother, that ſhe would hardly admit ſuch a circumſtance to be poſſible; yet the likeneſs, which it had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently been affirmed ſhe bore to the late Marchioneſs, the former behaviour of Dorothee the old houſekeeper, the aſſertion of Laurentini, and the myſterious attachment, which St. Aubert had diſcovered, awakened doubts, as to his connection with the Marchioneſs, which her reaſon could neither vanquiſh, or confirm. From theſe, however, ſhe was now relieved, and all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of her father's conduct were fully explained; but her heart was oppreſſed by the melancholy cataſtrophe of her amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble relative, and by the awful leſſon, which the hiſtory of the nun exhibited, the in ulgence of whoſe paſſions had been the means of leading her gradually to the commiſſion of a crime, from the prophecy of which in her early years ſhe would have recoiled in horror, and exclaimed—that it could not be!—a crime, which whole years of repentance and of the ſevereſt pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance had not been able to obliterate from her conſcience.</p>

                     <p>AFTER the late diſcoveries, Emily was diſtinguiſhed at the chateau by the Count and his family, as a relative of the houſe of Villeroi, and received, if poſſible, more friendly attention, than had yet been ſhewn her.</p>
                     <p>Count De Villefort's ſurpriſe at the delay of an anſwer to his letter which had been directed to Valancourt, at Eſtuviere, was mingled with ſatiſfaction for the prudence, which had ſaved Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from a ſhare of the anxiety he now ſuffered, though, when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching nuptials of the Lady Blanche now divided his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with this ſubject of his anxiety, for the inhabitants of the chateau were already buſied in preparations for that event, and the arrival of Monſ. St. Foix, was daily expected. In the gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, which ſurrounded her, Emily vainly tried to participate, her ſpirits being depreſſed by the late diſcoveries, and by the anxiety concerning the fate of Valancourt, that had been occaſioned by the deſcription of his manner, when he had delivered the ring. She ſeemed to perceive in it the gloomy wildneſs of deſpair; and, when ſhe conſidered to what that deſpair might have urged him, her heart ſunk with terror and grief. The ſtate of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe, as to his ſafety, to which ſhe believed herſelf condemned, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Here, the faint roar of foaming waves, that beat below, and the ſullen murmur of the wind among the branches around, were circumſtances in uniſon with the temper of her mind; and ſhe would ſit on a cliff, or on the broken ſteps of her favourite watch tower, obſerving the changing colours of the evening clouds, and the gloom of twilight draw over the ſea, till the white <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ops of billows, riding towards the ſhore, could ſcarcely be diſcerned amidſt the darkened waters. The lines, engraved by Valancourt on this tower, ſhe frequently repeated with melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly enthuſiaſm, and then would endeavour to check the recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections

and the grief they occaſioned, and to turn her thoughts to indifferent ſubjects.</p>
                     <p>One evening, having wandered with her lute to this her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite ſpot, ſhe entered the ruined tower, and aſcended a winding ſtaircaſe, that led to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The ſun was now ſetting on that tract of the Pyrenees, which divides Languedoc from Rouſillon, and, placing herſelf oppoſite to a ſmall grated window, which, like the wood tops beneath, and the waves lower ſtill, gleamed with the red glow of the weſt, ſhe touched the chords of her lute in ſolemn ſymphony, and then accompanied it with her voice, in one of the ſimple and affecting airs, to which, in hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier days, Valancourt had often liſtened in rapture, and which ſhe now adapted to the following lines.</p>

                     <p>The ſoft tranquillity of the ſcene below, where the evening breeze ſcarcely curled the water, or ſwelled the paſſing ſail, that caught the laſt gleam of the ſun, and where, now and then, a dipping oar was all that diſturbed the trembling radiance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired with the tender melody of her lute to lull her mind into a ſtate of gentle ſadneſs, and ſhe ſung the mournful ſongs of paſt times, till the remembrances they awakened were too powerful for her heart, her tears fell upon the lute, over which ſhe droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and her voice trembled, and was unable to proceed.</p>
                     <p>Though the ſun had now ſunk behind the mountains, and even his reflected light was fading from their higheſt points, Emily did not leave the watch tower, but continued to indulge her melancholy reverie, till a footſtep, at a little diſtance, ſtartled her, and, on looking through the grate, ſhe obſerved a perſon walking below, whom however, ſoon perceiving to be Monſ. Bonnac, ſhe returned to the quiet thoughtfulneſs his ſtep had interrupted. After ſometime, ſhe again ſtruck her lute, and ſung her favourite air; but again a ſtep diſturbed her, and, as ſhe pauſed to liſten, ſhe heard it aſcending the ſtaircaſe of the tower. The gloom of the hour, perhaps, made her ſenſible to ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> which ſhe might not otherwiſe have felt; for, only a few minutes before, ſhe had ſeen Monſ. Bonnac paſs. The ſteps were quick and bounding, and, in the next moment, the door of the chamber opened, and a perſon entered, whoſe fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were veiled in the obſcurity of twilight; but his voice could not be concealed, for it was the voice of Valancourt!</p>
                     <p>At the ſound, never heard by Emily without emotion, ſhe ſtarted, in terror, aſtoniſhment and doubtful pleaſure, and had ſcarcely beheld him at her feet, when ſhe ſunk into a ſeat, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the various emotions, that contended at her heart, and almoſt inſenſible to that voice, whoſe earneſt and trembling calls ſeemed as if endeavouring to ſave her. Valancourt, as he hung over Emily, deplored his own raſh impatience, in having thus
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:029378_0341_0FE088F20F48FE90"/>
ſurpriſed: her for when he had arrived at the chateau, too anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious to await the return of the Count, who, he underſtood, was in the grounds, he went himſelf to ſeek him, when, as he paſſed the tower, he was ſtruck by the ſound of Emily's voice, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately aſcended.</p>
                     <p>It was a conſiderable time before ſhe revived, but, when her recollection returned, ſhe repulſed his attentions, with an air of reſerve, and inquired, with as much diſpleaſure as it was poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhe could feel in theſe firſt moments of his appearance, the occaſion of his viſit.</p>
                     <p>"Ah Emily!" ſaid Valancourt, "that air, thoſe words—alas! I have, then, little to hope—when you ceaſed to eſteem me, you ceaſed alſo to love me!"</p>
                     <p>"Moſt true, ſir," replied Emily, endeavouring to command her trembling voice; "and if you had valued my eſteem, you would not have given me this new occaſion for uneaſineſs."</p>
                     <p>Valancourt's countenance changed ſuddenly from the anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of doubt to an expreſſion of ſurpriſe and diſmay: he was ſilent a moment, and then ſaid, "I had been taught to hope for a very different reception! Is it, then, true, Emily, that I have loſt your regard, for ever? am I to believe, that, though your eſteem for me may return—your affection never can? Can ſhe Count have meditated the cruelty, which now tortures me with a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death?"</p>
                     <p>The voice in which he ſpoke this, alarmed Emily as much as his words ſurpriſed her, and, with trembling impatience, ſhe begged that he would explain them.</p>
                     <p>"Can any explanation be neceſſary?" ſaid Valancourt, "do you not know how cruelly my conduct has been miſrepreſented? that the actions of which you once believed me guilty (and, O Emily! how could you ſo degrade me in your opinion, even for a moment!) thoſe actions—I hold in as much contempt and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence as yourſelf? Are you, indeed, ignorant, that Count De Villefort has detected the ſlanders, that have robbed me of all I hold dear on earth, and has invited me hither to juſtify to you my former conduct? It is ſurely impoſſible you can be uninformed of theſe circumſtances, and I am again torturing myſelf with a falſe hope!"</p>
                     <p>The ſilence of Emily confirmed this ſuppoſition; for the deep twilight would not allow Valancourt to diſtinguiſh the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and doubting joy, that fixed her features. For a moment, ſhe continued unable to ſpeak; then a profound ſigh ſeemed to give ſome relief to her ſpirits, and ſhe ſaid,
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:029378_0341_0FE088F20F48FE90"/>
"Valancourt! I was, till this moment, ignorant of all the circumſtances you have mentioned; the emotion I now ſuffer may aſſure you the truth of this, and, that, though I had ceaſed to eſteem, I had not taught myſelf entirely to forger you."</p>
                     <p>"This moment," ſaid Valancourt, in a low voice, and lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſupport againſt the window—"this moment brings with it a conviction that overpowers me! I am dear to you then—ſtill dear to you, my Emily!"</p>
                     <p>"Is it neceſſary that I ſhould tell you ſo?" ſhe replied, "is it neceſſary that I ſhould ſay—theſe are the firſt moments of joy I have known ſince your departure, and that they repay me for all thoſe of pain I have ſuffered in the interval?"</p>
                     <p>Valancourt ſighed deeply, and was unable to reply; but, as he preſſed her hand to his lips, the tears, that fell over it ſpoke a language which could not be miſtaken, and to which words were inadequate.</p>
                     <p>Emily, ſomewhat tranquillized, propoſed returning to the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau, and then, for the firſt time, recollected that the Count had invited Valancourt thither to explain his conduct, and that no explanation had yet been given. But, while ſhe acknowledged this, her heart would not allow her to dwell, for a moment, on the poſſibility of his unworthineſs; his look, his voice, his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, all ſpoke the noble ſincerity, which had formerly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed him; and ſhe again permitted heſelf to indulge the emotions of a joy, more ſurpriſing and powerful, than ſhe had ever before experienced.</p>
                     <p>Neither Emily, or Valancourt, were conſcious how they reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the chateau, whither they might have been transferred by the ſpell of a fairy, for any thing they could remember; and it was not, till they had reached the great hall, that either of them recollected there were other perſons in the world beſides them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The Count then came forth with ſurpriſe, and with the joyfulneſs of pure benevolence, to welcome Valancourt, and to entreat his forgiveneſs of the injuſtice he had done him; ſoon after which, Monſ. Bonnac joined this happy group, in which he and Valancourt were mutually rejoiced to meet.</p>
                     <p>When the firſt congratulations were over, and the general joy became ſomewhat more tranquil, the Count withdrew with Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancourt to the library, where a long converſation paſſed between them, in which the latter ſo clearly juſtified himſelf of the crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inal parts of the conduct, imputed to him, and ſo candidly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed and ſo feelingly lamented the follies, which he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, that the Count was confirmed in the belief of all he had hoped; and, while he perceived ſo many noble virtues in Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:029378_0342_0FE088FE51064AA8"/>
and that experience had taught him to deteſt the follies, which before he had only not admired, he did not ſcruple to believe, that be would paſs through life with the dignity of a wiſe and good man, or to entruſt to his care the future happineſs of Emily St. Aubert, for whom he felt the ſolicitude of a parent. Of this he ſoon informed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, in a ſhort converſation, when Valancourt had left him. While Emily liſtened to a relation of the ſervices, that Valancourt had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Monſ. Bonnac. her eyes overflowed with tears of pleaſure, and the further converſation of Count De Villefort perfectly diſſipated every doubt, as to the paſt and future conduct of him, to whom ſhe now reſtored, without fear, the eſteem and affection, with which ſhe had formerly received him.</p>
                     <p>When they returned to the ſupper room, the Counteſs and Lady Blanche met Valancourt with ſincere congratulations; and Blanche, indeed, was ſo much rejoiced to ſee Emily returned to happineſs, as to forget for a while, that Monſ. St. Foix was not yet arrived at the chateau, though he had been expected for ſome hours; but her gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous ſympathy was, ſoon after, rewarded by his appearance. He was now perfectly recovered from the wounds, received, during his perilous adventure among the Pyrenees, the mention of which ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to heighten to the parties, who had been involved in it, the ſenſe of their preſent happineſs. New congratulations paſſed between them, and round the ſupper table appeared a group of faces, ſmiling with felicity, but with a felicity, which had in each a different char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter. The ſmile of Blanche was frank and gay, that of Emily ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and penſive; Valancourt's was rapturous, tender and gay alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately; Monſ. St. Foix's was joyous, and that of the Count, as he looked on the ſurrounding party, expreſſed the tempered complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of benevolence; while the features of the Counteſs. He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>, and Monſ. Bonnac, diſcovered fainter traces of animation. Poor Monſ. Du Pont did not, by his peſence, throw a ſhade of regret over the company; for, when he had diſcovered, that Valancourt was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the eſteem of Emily, he determined ſeriouſly to endeavour at the conqueſt of his own hopeleſs affection, and had immediately withdrawn from Chateau-la-Blanc—a conduct, which Emily now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, and rewarded with her admiration and pity.</p>
                     <p>The Count and his gueſts continued together till a late hour, yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the delights of ſocial gaiety, and to the ſweets of friendſhip. When Annette heard of the arrival of Valancourt, Ludovico had ſome difficulty to prevent her going into the ſupper room, to expreſs her joy, for ſhe declared, that ſhe had never been ſo rejoiced at any <hi>accident</hi> as this, ſince ſhe had found Ludovico himſelf.</p>

                     <p>THE marriages of the Lady Blanche and Emily St. Aubert were celebrated, on the ſame day, and with the ancient baronial magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, at Chateau-le-Blanc. The feaſts were held in the great hall of the caſtle, which, on this occaſion, was hung with ſuperb new ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtry; repreſenting the exploits of Charlemagne and his twelve peers; here, were ſeen the Saracens, with their horrible viſors, advancing to battle; and there, were diſplayed the wild ſolemnities of incantation, and the necromantic feats, exhibited by the magician Jarl before the Emperor. The ſumptuous banners of the family of Villeroi, which had long ſlept in duſt, were once more unfurled, to wave over the goth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic points of painted caſements; and muſic echoed, in many a lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering cloſe, through every winding gallery and colonnade of that vaſt edifice.</p>
                     <p>As Annette looked down from the corridor upon the hall, whoſe arches and windows were illuminated with brilliant feſtoons of lamps, and gazed on the ſplendid dreſſes of the dancers, the coſtly liveries of the attendants, the canopies of purple velvet and gold, and liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the gay ſtrains that floated along the vaulted roof, ſhe almoſt fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied herſelf in an inchanted palace, and declared, that ſhe had not met with any place, which charmed her ſo much, ſince ſhe read the fairy tales; nay, that the fairies themſelves, at their nightly revels in this old hall, could diſplay nothing finer; while old Dorothee, as ſhe ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed the ſcene, ſighed, and ſaid, the caſtle looked as it was wont to do in the time of her youth.</p>
                     <p>After gracing the feſtivities of Chateau-le-Blanc, for ſome days Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancourt and Emily took leave of their kind friends, and returned to La Vallee, where the faithful Thereſa received them with unfeigned joy, and the pleaſant ſhades welcomed them with a thouſand tender and affecting remembrances; and, while they wandered together over the ſcenes, ſo long inhabited by the late Monſ. and Madame St. Aubert, and Emily pointed out, with penſive affection, their favourite haunts, her preſent happineſs was heightened, by conſidering, that it would have been worthy of their approbation, could they have witneſſed it.</p>
                     <p>Valancourt led her to the plane tree on the terrace, where he had firſt ventured to declare his love, and where now the remembrance of the anxiety he had then ſuffered, and the retroſpect of all the dangers and misfortunes they had each encountered, ſince laſt they ſat together be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath its broad branches, exalted the ſenſe of their preſent felicity, which, on this ſpot, ſacred to ſhe memory of St. Aubert, they ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emnly vowed to deſerv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, as far as poſſible, by endeavouring to imitate his benevolence,—by remembering, that ſuperior attainments of every
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:029378_0343_0FE08904B7424D20"/>
fort bring with them duties of ſuperior exertion, and by affording to their fellow beings, together with that portion of ordinary comforts, which proſperity always owes to misfortune, the example of lives paſſed in happy thankfulneſs to GOD, and, therefore, in careful ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs to his creatures.</p>
                     <p>Soon after their return to La Vallee, the brother of Valancourt came to congratulate him on his marriage, and to pay his reſpects to Emily<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with whom he was ſo much pleaſed, as well as with the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of rational happineſs, which theſe nuptials offered to Valancourt, that he immediately reſigned to him a part of the rich domain, the whole of which, as he had no family, would of courſe deſcend to his brother, on his deceaſe.</p>
                     <p>The eſtates, at Tholouſe, were diſpoſed of, and Emily purchaſed of Monſ. Queſnel the ancient domain of her late father, where, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given Annette a marriage portion, ſhe ſettled her as the houſekeep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and Ludovico as the ſteward; but, ſince both Valancourt and her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf preferred the pleaſant and long loved ſhades of La Vallee to the magnificence of Epourville, they continued to reſide there, paſſing, however, a few months in the year at the birth place of St. Aubert, in tender reſpect to his memory.</p>
                     <p>The legacy, which had been bequeathed to Emily by Signora Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentini, ſhe begged Valancourt would allow her to reſign to Monſ. Bonnac; and Valancourt, when ſhe made the requeſt, felt all the value of the compliment it conveyed. The caſtle of Udolpho alſo, deſcended to the wife of Monſ. Bonnac, who was the neareſt ſurviv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing relation of the houſe of that name, and thus affluence reſtored his long oppreſſed ſpirits to peace, and his family to comfort.</p>
                     <p>O! how joyful it is to tell of happineſs, ſuch as that of Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court and Emily; to relate, that, after ſuffering under the oppreſſion of the vicious and the diſdain of the weak, they were, at length, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to each other—to the beloved landſcapes of their native coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try—to the ſecureſt felicity of this life that of aſpiring to moral and labouring for intellectual improvement—to the pleaſures of enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened ſociety, and to the exerciſe of the benevolence which had always animated their hearts; while the bowers of La Vallee become, once more, the retreat of goodneſs, wiſdom and domeſtic bleſſedneſs!</p>
                     <p>O! uſeful may it be to have ſhewn, that, though the vicious can ſometimes pour affliction upon the good, their power is tranſient and their puniſhment certain; and that innocence, though oppreſſed by injuſtice, ſhall, ſupported by patience, finally triumph over misfortune.</p>
                     <p>And if the weak hand, that has recorded this tale, has, by its ſcenes, beguiled the mourner of one hour of ſorrow, or, by its moral, taught him to ſuſtain it—the effort, however humble, has not been vain, nor is the writer unrewarded.</p>
