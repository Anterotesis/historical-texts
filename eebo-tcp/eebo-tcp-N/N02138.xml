            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To ſee Men merry and jocund, when God is angry, or to ſet light by his Corrections. Iſai. 22.12, 13, 14. <hi>And in that day did the Lord God of hoſts call to weeping, and to mourning, and to boldneſs, and to girding with ſackcloth; and behold joy and gladneſs, ſlaying Oxen, and killing Sheep eat-fleſh, and drinking wine; Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we ſhall die. And it was revealed in mine ears by the Lord of hoſts, ſurely this iniquity ſhall not be purged from you, till ye die ſaith the Lord God of hoſts.</hi> Surely, the diſpleaſure of God in Afflictions and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ought to be laid to Heart.

for the Lord. Mat. 11.12. <hi>From the days of John the Baptiſt, the kingdom of heaven had ſuffered violence, and the violent took it by force.</hi> Men were fond of hearing the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, the People deſired good preaching, <hi>the harveſt was plenteous, the fields were white to the harveſt,</hi> as our Saviour expreſſeth it in another place, <hi>John</hi> 4.35. But the miſery of it was, <hi>the Labourers were few.</hi> There were few that would faithfully deliver the mind of God; there were abundance of idle <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and <hi>Scribes,</hi> and <hi>Prieſts,</hi> that ſpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For what ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Health, and Life, and Vigour can there be in thoſe Souls, that are fed with Husks and Aſhes, inſtead of the <hi>Bread of Life.

back. The Teachers of the <hi>Jews</hi> had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be Shepherds, yet Chriſt ſaith, they had no Shepherds: For they were worſe than none, idol Shepherds, that led them away inſtead of reducing them, and fleec'd the Flock inſtead of feeding it. This moved the Bowels of Chriſt, his Heart yearned towards the People, when he ſaw the lamentable Condition they were in. And for the remedying it, he puts his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples on to pray for them. <hi>Pray ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord of the Harveſt, that he will ſend forth Labourers into is Harvest.</hi>

planted, daily preaching among you. He further was a means to build you up in faith and holineſs, but God increaſed, or gave the increaſe; God gave the power by which they brought forth fruit. The ſimilitude is drawn from Planters, either Husdandmen or Gardiners, they plant, they water, but the growing, the budding, the bringing forth flowers, or fruit by the plant, doth much more depend upon the Soil in which it ſtands, the influence of Heaven upon it, the beams of the Sun, and the drops of the Dew and Rain, and the internal vertue, which the God of nature hath created in the plant, than upon the hand of him, that planteth, or him who uſeth his watering-pot to water it. So it is with Souls, one Miniſter is uſed for Converſion, or the firſt changing of Souls; another is uſed for Edification or further building up of Souls; but both Converſion and Edification are infinitely more from the New Heart &amp; New Nature, which God giveth to the Soul from the influence of the Sun of Righteouſneſs by the Spirit of Grace, working in and upon the Soul, than from any Miniſter, who is God's Inſtrument in thoſe Works. So that look as it is in earthly Plantations, God hath the greateſt influence upon the growth

So it is in the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Plantation, God is the principal efficient Cauſe, we are little inſtrumental cauſes in his hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nothing in compariſon with God.

Their Power is not ſecular, but ſpiritual, their Authority is not legiſlative, but exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive. They are to govern not by their own Will &amp; Humour, but by the Laws of Chriſt, according to the Orders he hath appointed for the Edification of the Church, and the Preſervation of it, in Purity, Holineſs, and Obedience. This alſo is a laborious Work. All kind of Government is burdenſome. The Government of the Church is ſo in a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Manner, Heb. 12.15. <hi>Looking diligently lest any Man fail of the grace of God, leſt any root of bitterneſs ſpringing up trouble you, and ſo many be defiled.</hi> Rev. 2.2. <hi>I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou

Mat. 24.25. <hi>Who is that faithful and wiſe ſervant, whom his Lord hath made ruler over his houſhold to give them their meat in due ſeaſon.</hi> There is great need of Labour and Diligent ſtudy to prepare themſelves, for this Part of their Work, that they may know how to behave themſelves in <hi>the Church of the living God,</hi> which is the Pillar &amp; Ground of Truth.
