            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>REASONS, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WHEREAS I have been a profeſſor among the People called <hi>Shakers,</hi> and have zealouſly labored, both in public and private, (whereof many hundreds are witneſſes) to promote and build up the profeſſion; but have of late ſeparated myſelf from that people, it ſeemed to me not unreaſonable and no more than what might be juſtly expected, that I ſhould ſhew ſome reaſon or cauſe for ſo doing. In order for this I ſhall endeavor to give a ſhort account of my life and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences, from my youth up to this time, including my manner of faith before I heard of this people, the manner of my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering in among them, and the faith I received in hearing their teſtimony, and my perſeverence in it. Together with my tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als and tribulations which I have had of late, which has effected my ſeparation. Avoiding, if poſſible, every thing that may create or increaſe a ſpirit of hatred or envy againſt this people, for it is to be lamented there is a great deal too much already. But as it is my purpoſe and intention only ſimply to ſtate my reaſons, and ſubmit the matter to God the judge of all, I hope it may give no offence, neither to Jew nor Gentile, nor to the Church of God.</p>
            <p>To give a particular account of my life, and the exerciſes of my mind from the days of my infancy, would be a labor too tedious for me to endure at this time, as my health is much impaired by a continued ſeries of afflictions But I ſhall only ſay, that from the time I began to know between good and evil, till I was about eighteen years of age, a great part of the time my mind was exerciſed with fearful and awful apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of a future judgment; ſometimes to that degree, that I could wiſh myſelf a <hi>toad</hi> or a <hi>ſnake</hi> or any thing that had no ſoul to exiſt in futurity. At length I was brought to expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience a change of ſenſation, the particulars of which may not be neceſſary to relate now. but I was made to love God for what he was in himſelf: I had ſuch a ſenſe of the love of God, through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for the ſalvation and happineſs of his creatures, that I was no more afraid what he would do with me; but was determined to ſerve and obey God to the end of my days. Here I muſt obſerve one thing (as I mean to be an honeſt man) which I have made uſe of in ſupport of one principle of faith, which I afterwards received among this people called <hi>Shakers</hi>—the thing I mean is this, I had obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the courſe of my life that one of the greateſt things that operated upon the minds of young people, was a connection
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:038359_0003_1011C9AD7B269018"/>between <hi>male</hi> and <hi>female,</hi> the mode or manner in which it was carried on, (which is needleſs for me to relate) made it appear to me like an earthly ſenſual pleaſure, ſo that when my heart was full of love to God, and was reſolved to forſake all car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal enjoyments, for the ſervice of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, I though<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I could never get a wife without laying aſide my religion. This I obſerved to ſome of my friends at the time: But although I felt this fenſation for myſelf, yet I did not doubt but what it might be right for men and women to marry and propagate their ſpecies; but whether I was overmuch righteous or not, is a matter I chooſe to leave for the preſent, and proceed farther, as to the change of ſenſation which I received. Doubtleſs it was thought by profeſſed Chriſtians in general, to be the new birth, or real converſion, by which the foul is entitled to the kingdom of Heaven: But as for my own part I never pretended to ſay whether it was or was not; but my hope of everlaſting life was in loving the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and obeying his goſpel—believing that what was contained in the ſcriptures was a ſufficient rule to walk by, and by which I ſhould be judged at the laſt day.</p>
            <p>However, after ſome time, forgetting the commandments of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to watch and pray always, or, at leaſt, not attending to it, I became carnally minded, and loſt, in a great meaſure, my confidence towards God, and that life and comfort which I had before enjoyed. At length, in the ſpring of the year 1780 I heard a rumour of a ſtrange people at <hi>Niſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kauna,</hi> that was poſſeſſed of remarkable gifts and power, and held to ſtrange doctrines, ſuch as I had never heard before, one thing particular, which drew my attention, was the <hi>croſs</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the fleſh (as it is called,) or denying all matrimonial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection between <hi>male</hi> and <hi>female,</hi> &amp;c. This brought to my mind what I had felt before in myſelf; and I rather believed it muſt be of God, although I had never ſearched the ſcripture, to ſee if it was agreeable to the ſacred record: But as num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of my friends and acquaintance ſoon went to ſee them, and brought back very wonderful reports which increaſed my faith, ſo that I was reſolved to go and ſee them for myſelf; not doubting but what they were the people of God—at length, ſome time in July 1780, I went with a number of oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to ſee them, at <hi>Niſkauna,</hi> to hear and ſee for myſelf, and having an opportunity then, and from time to time, after I received the following principles of faith: viz. But firſt, I deſire to be underſtood, what I am going to relate as the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of my faith, is not what I ſuggeſted in myſelf, but what I really heard preached, either from the firſt miniſters, or from others that were authorized by them to preach: that is, That the <hi>great and laſt day</hi> had began—that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt had made his ſecond appearance in that perſon which
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:038359_0004_1011C9B0C3B956B0"/>was called the <hi>mother</hi>—hat ſhe was redeemed from all ſin, and ſtood without fault before the throne of God—that the fulneſs of the Godhead dwelt in her bodily, as really as it did in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in his firſt appearance, and as much greater as his ſecond appearance was to be greater than the firſt. I underſtood and believed that ſhe was the woman ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in the 12th chapter of Rev. and in Jeremiah 31ſt chap. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d verſe, that as the Lord Jeſus Chriſt was the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo ſhe was the ſecond <hi>Eve</hi>—that as the firſt <hi>Eve</hi> was firſt in the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion which effected the fall of the human race, ſo ſhe, as the ſecond <hi>Eve,</hi> had the firſt gift &amp; revelation of God, to effect com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely the reſtoration from the fall, which was to be redeemed and delivered wholly from the power, ſpirit, and nature, that produced natural generation, which was ſaid to be the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fruit that was in the midſt of the garden, that our firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents were forbidden to touch upon pain of death. I believed that regeneration ſignified the reſurrection from the dead, that Chriſt ſpoke of in Luke, 20th chapter, 35th and 36th verſes. where he ſays, "But they which ſhall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the reſurrection from the dead, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther marry nor are given in marriage, neither can they die any more, for they are equal unto the angels, and are the children of God, being the children of the reſurrection." I believed that the mother with ſome others which were with her, ſtood completely in the reſurrection, and were equal unto the angels, and were converſant and familiar with inviſible beings in a ſpiritual world, and that they were not ſubject to any natural diſorders or infirmities which were incident to the reſt of mankind—I believed that God had given them the ſpirit and power of judgment, to judge the world both quick and dead, and that their power and teſtimony would increaſe till it ſhould gather all Nations, and ſet them on the right hand or on the left, according to what is written in Mathew, 25th chapter and 31ſt verſe: and ſoon I believed the day and time had commenced which was prophecied of, in Iſaiah, 2d chapter and 2d verſe, &amp;c. and in Daniel 2d chapter and 44th verſe; and 7th chapter, 9th and 10th verſes; and in Iſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah 65th chapter, 17th verſe, and ſo on; and in Revelations, 20th and 21ſt chapters. Many more places might be mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed which purport the ſame thing, but perhaps it is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</p>
            <p>All this I ſay I believed, without the leaſt doubt, and my labor and concern was to come into poſſeſſion of that which I had faith in. In order for this I was taught, I muſt confeſs all my ſins: this I did willingly and honeſtly; believing myſelf to be before the bar of <hi>eternal juſtice,</hi> where the thoughts and intents of my heart were fully and clearly ſeen and known I was alſo taught, that I muſt take up my croſs againſt all ſin;
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:038359_0005_1011C9B3FB615EC8"/>but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n a ſpecial manner <hi>againſt the luſt of the fleſh,</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded not only all manner of uncleanneſs, contrary to the order of nature, and all natural feelings and actions between <hi>male</hi> and <hi>female;</hi> but comprehended all natural union between natural relations, as being the product and fruits of the fleſh: and alſo to labor for the power of God to deſtroy the very nature of the fleſh ſo as to become an <hi>Eunuch</hi> for the kingdom of heaven's ſake. This I underſtood to be a total deſtruction of the nature of generation, both as to the inclination of the ſpirit and the natural faculties of, the body. Although this is not held ſo now among the people; yet I am ſure it was ſo communicated by the firſt Miniſters, and ſo received and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by all the people. It was held that the ſeed ſpoken of by the Apoſtle John in his firſt epiſtle, 3d chapter and 9th verſe, was the natural ſeed of copulation: it was held that the marriage in Cana of Gallilee, ſpoken of in the 2d chapter of John, was nothing elſe but the union of Chriſt and his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: it was alſo abundantly taught, that what was contained in the <hi>ſcriptures</hi> was of no uſe to us, as it reſpected our <hi>travail,</hi> being all in a back diſpenſation; but that which was the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent gift of the Church muſt be received as the infallible word of God.</p>
            <p>All theſe things which I have mentioned, I had no more doubt of than I had of the being of an eternal God; but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bored accordingly, in full faith and hope of obtaining a full and complete redemption from the nature and root of all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, which I believed to be the luſt of the fleſh, as I have before obſerved, my faith was ſo firm that I do not remember ever at one time reading or ſearching the ſcriptures, for my own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation but only for the purpoſe of having wherewith to prove the truth of my profeſſion, and to convince gainſayets. At length, being found faithful and obedient, I received an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to labor, with others, and receive confeſſions; which I went forth in, according as I was taught, and received the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and bleſſing of the Church, and the work ſeemed to flouriſh and proſper, to my great encouragement, till ſome time in the ſummer of the year 1783, when an unhappy diſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion appeared in the Church, and as the matter could not be, or was not kept private, but did and has got abroad among the world, it may not be amiſs for me to give a ſketch of it; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is far from my purpoſe to be a ſlanderer, or to ſet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>It may be remembered that I before obſerved, it was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>, an Engliſhman. It was underſtood by all, from our firſt acquaintance with them, that William Leas ſtood next to the mother, and James Whittaker next to him. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in the ſummer of the year 1783, a ſtrife aroſe (or at leaſt it did not appear before to my knowledge) between them, which ſhould be firſt—the mother interfered to ſettle the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, and the contention was very unhappy, and proved the means, I believe, of ſeparating a number that appeared to be ſtrong believers; but it had no effect to ſhake my faith at all; although I was an eye witneſs to that, which would be really ſhocking to humanity. My faith was ſo ſtrong in the mother, believing ſhe had the ſole government of all ſouls, both quick and dead, and was actuated wholly by the power of the inviſible God, that if I had ſeen her ſmite a man dead I don't know as I ſhould have dared to give myſelf liberty to think it was wrong. But finally the diſpute terminated in the death of William Leas, in July, 1784. And by the death of the mother in September following, the miniſtration and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church revolved on James Whittaker; this to be ſure was a very trying time to believers; it being ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary from what was firſt expected; but elder James ſoon gath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered the greateſt part of the people to a comfortable faith in his miniſtration, ſignifying it was neceſſary for the mother to go away in order for a further increaſe of the goſpel—he prophecied abundantly of a great increaſe and ſpread of the goſpel, which was ſoon to take place.</p>
            <p>He finally ordered the people to ſell their poſſeſſions and give to the poor, and to go forth and preach the goſpel, in obedience to the gift: ſome actually ſold their poſſeſſions, others were preparing to do it; for my part I had nothing to ſell, but went to the Church to know what the gift was for me, &amp; ſpoke to Elder James, his words to me were theſe, <hi>"Go forth and circumciſe as many as you can."</hi> In obedience to his order, I went forth and took a journey down into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut, where for my teſtimony I was taken <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

However the order that was given for the people to ſell their poſſeſſions was taken off—they were told the time had not come, but that it was a gift to try their faith—ſo that they which had ſold, had to buy again, and ſo the matter reſted.</p>
            <p>As for me, after I got releaſed from priſon, and by the help of ſome of my friends, ſettled all my expences; I r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned again to Elder James where I had the privilege of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeveral journies with him, and as I had a peculiar faculty in ſinging, my gift was chiefly to labor in Songs. But the laſt journey I went with him, which was in the year 1787, the latter part of the winter—on returning home he was taken ſick ſo that he could g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This was a very trying ſcene with me, as well as many oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, for I think I can truly ſay I loved him as I did my own life. Notwithſtanding, I was not at all ſhaken in my faith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> but believed that God would carry on his own work—and as there was ſeveral men who ſeemed to be bleſſed with great abilities, which had labored in the miniſtry with Elder James, we were not left without hope; but that the goſpel would yet increaſe according to what had been ſpoken. At this time there was a very ſtrong labor among three men, who were the principal miniſters that were left, to know which of them ſhould have the firſt gift. At length the lot ſell upon Elder JOSEPH MEACHEM, a man greatly beloved and reſpected by all the people. His labor ſeemed to be to gather the ſenſation of the people to a farther increaſe, ſignifying the departure of Elder James was neceſſary for the further increaſe of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and that it was impoſſible to take place while he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the body. The manner of the increaſe here ſpoken of, I ſhall ende<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>vor to deſcribe in as few words as I can, ſo as to comprehend the ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>It was ſignified that the believers as a body were all in fleſhly relation, and that the time had come for a number to be gathered out of that relation into church relation, to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and purified from the fleſh, and be prepared to miniſter the goſpel to others. The firſt gathering took place at New-Lebanon in 1788, where there was a great number gathered, both <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ale and female; numbers of which were ſelected from all the different parts, among believers; ſome on account of their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar ingenuity and faculties in temporal things, to be helps in the temporal order of the Church; others (it was ſignified) were gathered for the more ſpecial purpoſe of being helps to other ſouls, in ſpriitual things; others were gathered merely, for the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r own protection and ſalvation; and others on account of their temporal property. Theſe were all under a daily miniſtration, for Elder Joſeph and ſome others, who were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants to him in the miniſtry; but the labors and exerciſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and ſpirit, which this people were exerciſed in under the daily miniſtration, is not eaſily conceived by any one who was not a witneſs of what I ſhall not undertake to be particular: but believe it will be ſufficient to ſay, that their chief labor was to deſtroy the whole order of nature, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to obtain the power of God, ſo as to wholly actuate and move the human frame, independent of any natural ſtrength. How much propriety there was in the undertaking, time has ſufficiently ſhewn; upon which I ſhall obſerve hereafter.</p>

Miniſters were ſent from the Church to other parts to kindle the ſame fire, and in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular manner to Hancock, the then place of my reſidence, where the flame burnt ſo exceedingly that it ſeemed as though nothing would remain but juſt faith; but that ſeemed to be as unſhaken as ever. At length, after two or three years of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remitting labors and tribulation, the time came for the people, in Hancock, to be gathered into Church relation; Elder CALVIN HARLOW, a very deſirable young man, and one who had the love and eſteem of all the peopie, was appointed as a Biſhop, for to gather the Church in Hancock, which took place in the firſt part of the year 1791. This ſeemed to be a time of comfort and ſatisfaction, hoping we ſhould now have a privilege to <hi>travail</hi> out of the fleſh, for we had underſtood that they which had a privilege in Church relation, could tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail farther out of the fleſh in one week than they which were in fleſhly relation could in a year; and as it was the moſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential principle of our faith, to find redemption from the fleſh, our hopes of ſalvation now inereaſed.</p>
            <p>But to proceed farther reſpecting the increaſe about or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this time, there was a further gift in the Church, at Leb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anon, which was called and is ſtill, the Mother Church; the gift was this, they were taught that they had got to find their order of relation to God, in the li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> of Church order; that is they had got to find who their Parents were, and who their Miniſters were, and who their Elders were, and alſo, their order of relation one to another, as brethren and fiſters; that is, to know who was 1ſt, 2d, 3d, &amp;c.—as to their parents it was doubtleſs without any difficulty they acknowledged Elder Joſeph to be their father in the Goſpel; but as to a mother, it was ſuch a new thing and ſo unexpected that there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a labor before the matter was finiſhed: as to the reſt, as it does not reſpect my preſent purpoſe, I ſhall omit ſaying any thing about it: but as the ſame line of order was prcaced to us in Hancock, and the perſons appointed and ſet before us, we had no difficulty in acknowledging them to be our Parents and received what they ſpoke to us as the oracle of God. Some time after we were called upon to labor, to know who our Elders were and find our relation to them—myſelf and one more male and two females were appointed, and called upon to labor for the lot of Elderſhip. We labored accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, believing what we were taught to be the infallible word of God.</p>
            <p>Now perhaps it may be enquired what was the work or buſineſs of theſe Elders, what was the purpoſe of their gift. It was this, they were to ſtand between their parents and the reſt of the family with whom they lived—they were to receive
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:038359_0009_1011C9BA74E23928"/>the word and counſel of God from their parents, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate the ſame to the reſt of the family—the family wera to look to the Elders, and to them only, for every gift of God they received; and likewiſe, the Elders to the parents: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it frequently happened that the parents ſpoke to individ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uals, and ſome times to all, as occaſion required. Now after we had labored ſome time, according to our firſt appointment, being called Elder brethren and Elder ſiſters, not knowing which was firſt or which was laſt; we were all told by our parents that there was but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ne Elder brother and one Elder ſiſter; there was one which was the oldeſt, and but one, and the family were all required to labor and manifeſt their faith who, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> one was, They accordingly labored, and all ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied their faith to be in me as their Elder brother, and that one who was a partner with me to be their Elder ſiſter This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ratified and confirmed by our parents as the gift of God, they all looked to me as their Elder, by which and through which they were to receive every gift of God that came to them. This brought me to a very ſolemn and weighty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, to diſcharge my duty in relation to my brethren and ſif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſo that they might receive comfort and conſolation, and I be acce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ted of God: but as I had full faith in my parents, and had liberty to aſk their counſel upon every needful occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, we ſeemed to enjoy in ſome meaſure, a comfortable <hi>travail,</hi> hoping yet to ſee the increaſe of the goſpel as had been prophecied. At length, Elder Calvin, whom we eſteemed as our father in the goſpeſ, was taken very ſick, ſo that he was not expected to continue in the body; his ſickneſs, however, (which rendered him unable, a great part of the time, to give much counſel or inſtruction in relation to the Church) did not immediately take him away; but he continued for more than a year, and departed this life the 21ſt of December, 1795.</p>
            <p>This was a time of much affliction and ſorrow; but yet my faith was unſhaken, and being encouraged by her whom we called and eſteemed to be our mother, that there would be an increaſe of the goſpel in a ſhort time, therefore we labored to take courage and hope in God. About this time I underſtood it was believed in the Church, at Lebanon, that the time was juſt at hand for the goſpel to be opened to the world, and about this time the gift of laboring for mortification came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to an end; it was found that we loſt our natural ſtrength faſte than we obtained the power of God to replace it, ſo that by this means a great many had gone into eternity, and a great many were very weak: by this time Elder Joſeph, the firſt Biſhop, who was believed in the Church to be the deſcendent of David that was to deſtroy Gog and Magog, became very much reduced and impaired in his health, though he ſeemed to labor very ſtrong for a further opening of the goſpel among
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:038359_0010_1011C9BDF9A11CE0"/>the world: yet he was obliged to ſubmit to the decrees of God, and bid adieu to time, which took place the 16th of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, 1796 This however, did not ſeem to be a matter of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement; but the forerunner of a farther increaſe, as it was ſupp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſed be had finiſhed his work that he had to do in this world, and that the gift for the farther opening of the goſpel was reſerved for HENRY CLOUGH, a young man who had labored in the miniſtry as an aſſiſtant to Elder Joſeph, though he was not firſt in the miniſtry, but was ſubject unto her whom he called his mother, which was the partner of Elder Joſeph; yet he was eſteemed to be a very wiſe man, and depended on as one who had a great work to do in relation to the farther opening and ſpread of the goſpel.</p>
            <p>Soon after Elder Joſeph's deceaſe, ſhe that was called our mother, in Hancock, was taken ſick, and continued a few weeks, and departed this life, which was on the 19th of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, 1796 Here began a ſcene of tribulation which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded all my former experience; although before th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

However, having been taught by our parents the order of our relation to God, and of ſome things that would be the gift after their deceaſe, which was not only ſpoke to me, but alſo to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the reſt. I was determined to labor according to the teaching we had received, hoping that God would open the way for our protection, and for the farther increaſe of the goſpel. About this time or not long after ſome things took place in relation to us, by the counſel or order of the Church at Lebanon, which was a matter of ſome trial, not to me only, but to the whole of the Church, as it appeared contradictory to what had been taught by our parents; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter giving myſelf an opportunity of being informed, it ſeemed to be made to appear that the matter was not inconſiſtent or contradictory to any thing which we had before received, but altogether neceffary for our increaſe.</p>
            <p>About this time there ſeemed to be a gift in the Church, at Lebanon, that the time had come for the goſpel to be opened to the world—miniſters were appointed and ſent forth under the direction of Henry Clough, or Elder Henry, as he was called; the gift was for them to go forth and preach the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to the world, and have them confeſs their ſins, &amp;c. and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:038359_0011_1011C9C3A2F69F60"/>remain where they were and not come to the Church. They went forth accordingly, time and again, and a great ſound there ſeemed to be, of abundance, of rain, as it were, which ſeemed to be a matter of great rejoicing: however, as there was not much brought to paſs, it was believed that they had not got the right gift, but that it was neceſſary to have another gift, which was this, they were to go forth and preach the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel and invite all to come to the Church: but this did not ſeem to have the deſired effect. Finally, it was thought that the lack was in the miniſters; they were ſuſpended and oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſent forth; but all to little or no purpoſe In the mean time Elder Henry, who was admired for his wiſdom and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, and depended on as one whom God had raiſed up for the defence and increaſe of the goſpel, was taken ſick and in a ſhort time left this world, which I think was about the firſt of March, 1798. Theſe things gave me much exerciſe of mind, it ſeemed as though God would deſtroy the hope of man ſure enough: yet I dared not give way to unbelie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> or to be diſcouraged; but labored to put as favorable conſtruction on every thing as I was able; but I was ready to ſay ſometimes to myſelf, "Merciful God, what is the matter, is all things right;" but would check myſelf, and ſhut it out, and labor to take courage: however, there were other things that increaſed my tribulation—one of which was this, there was ſome who were appointed by the mother Church, as miniſters to reſide <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

But, at length, in the increaſe, as it was called, there ſeemed to be that faith required of me, in relation to them, that I was not able to obtain, without further underſtanding, it appeared to me, as well as to a number of others that in order to believe and receive, what they told me I muſt reject, what we had been taught by our parents, and count them as decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and impoſters. This brought me under a great trial, and as I was not able to open my mind to my ſatisfaction, ſo as to find any help, I thought I would try one way more, and with the advice of ſome of my brethren, I ſet down and wrote a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty lengthy letter, wherein I ſtated my grievances and trials in as humble and Godly manner as I was able, deſiring to have ſome help in my mind if there was any for me in the Church.

I ſay I was in doubt whether we were not deceived in this foundation point of our faith, and if this was the caſe I was ſure that our building would all be in vain: therefore I was exerciſed in my mind with exceeding ſtrong labour to aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the matter; and having an opportunity with one who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed to be a miniſter and whom I looked to as my Elder, I aſked many queſtions in a very familiar manner, taking care not to diſcover myſelf full<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, but mentioned the feelings of ſome others in the family which indeed felt the ſame that I did; but by all that I could gather from him I found he was as dark as I was, and manifeſted that he himſelf was under trials, and ſaid he had a deſire ſometimes to aſk his mother ſome queſtions reſpecting the ſame matter; but was afraid of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accuſed of laboring out of his order, and be admoniſhed for it, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Here I found there was no light to be had, though he did not ſignify that be ſelf any unbelief reſpecting his profeſſion; but manifeſted darkneſs and ignorance.</p>
            <p>Now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>med as though there was but one alternative for me to take, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> I reſolved upon, which was this, to cry inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Before this time we had found by certain experience to a demonſtration, that one eſſential principle of our faith was no leſs that a gro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s abſurdity, which I ſhall endeavor to ſhew— the principle of our faith was this, we heard and believed that by confeſſing and forſaking our ſins, we ſhould be able by the power of God to labor completely out of the nature of the fleſh, that is to ſay, to wholly deſtroy that nature and faculty which is created in men and women for the purpoſe of propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating their ſpecie. This ſeemed to be the greateſt and moſt arduous work there was to be done; but receiving ſuch great encouragement, under ſtanding and believing that there was a number which had already attained to it, we undertook the work cheerfully, and labored all manner of ways that we could conceive would have any tendency to mortify the fleſh; but ſtill the fleſh lived, though ſome were ſo violent in their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, and brought their bodies under ſo much weakneſs that there was not much power of erection in the parts of genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but the ſolids being ſo relaxed and the retentive faculty ſo weakened, that they were more ſubject to involuntary evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations than they were before. However as there was abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:038359_0014_1011C9D0A448DD38"/>of means uſed to encourage us in the work, we perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with unremitting labors till the Church was gathered i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Lebanon. Then it ſeemed as though the fleſh would be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at once—the teſtimony againſt the fleſh increaſed—the labors and exerciſes of body were increaſed with great zeal and violence, ſo that in a ſhort time they who were the moſt zealous and faithful labored into that degree of mortification that the natural functions of the body were ſo impaired, and the power of retention ſo relax<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> that they were not able to keep themſelves from involuntary evacuations almoſt continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, which made ſome almoſt deſpair of ever being ſaved, as the natural ſeed of co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ulation was looked upon as the moſt unclean and hateful of any thing in the natural creation. However numbers labored out of the fleſh, that is to ſay, the blood ceaſed to circulate in the veins—the lungs ceaſed to do their office—the ſoul took its departure out of the fleſhly taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle. But the work was carried on with unremitting zeal, till a great number left the body and went into <hi>eternity,</hi> who, I have not the leaſt doubt but that they as really put an end to their own exiſtence in this world as though they had taken a doſe of poiſon or a raizor and cut their throats; but it was ſaid they gave up their lives for Chriſt's ſake: let that be as it may, I have no doubt they believed ſo.</p>
            <p>At length, after a while the gift ſeemed to abate about labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for mortification, till finally it came quite to an end. Phyſicians were appointed and ſet to labour to help the ſick and thoſe that were weak, to build up that which they had been deſtroying, though it had not been taught plainly to my knowledge that the idea was wholly given up, of totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying that nature in this world; yet what took place made it appear ſo.</p>
            <p>All theſe things I had obſerved and underſtood, and as I had the care of a conſiderable number that frequently opened their feelings and trials to me, and their unbelief in finding a total end to the fleſh in this world; I labored into the matter thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oughly, till I was fully ſatisfied for myſelf: I was informed, and that from good authority, that the firſt mother, whom we believed to be equal with the Angels, was ſubject to the ſame natural infirmities which were incident to other women, which, if true, as I had ſome underſtanding in the theory of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man machine, I was perſuaded ſhe was not delivered from the nature of generation, it being neceſſary for that purpoſe, and that only. Having underſtood all theſe things, and much more alſo, which I could mention were it neceſſary; I was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſuaded that it was as poſſible to ſtop the blood and juices from flowing into an arm or a leg, or to dry up the marrow in the bones, as to accompliſh what we had undertaken. Being fully ſatisfied I did not ſcruple to ſpeak my faith among my
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:038359_0015_1011C9D263D4C678"/>brethren; not for their diſcouragement but for their encouarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they might not be caſt down and diſcouraged if they felt the fleſh ever ſo ſtrong; knowing we had got it to fight to the end of our days: however I was exceedingly tried, as well as the reſt, to find we had been ſo deceived, not knowing but what we might be deceived in a great many other things as well as that; but being deſirous to know how the matter was held by them who were before us. I took an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity with the miniſter whom I looked to for counſel, and opened ſome of the brethren's feelings to him in relation to the matter. He at firſt ſeemed to intimate as though there was an evil ſpirit to work with them; but when I come to tell him frankly what my faith was in relation to the matter he gave the matter up, and joined with me, telling a number of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances to confirm it. But to return to the firſt principles of our faith, viz. The ſecond appearance of Chriſt in that woman which we called the mother. I have before obſerved, that ſhe was ſaid to be the woman ſpoken of in the 12th chap. of Rev. it was held that the man child ſhe brought forth was James Whittaker, and her going into the wilderneſs was her coming into America. Now when I came to read the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for myſelf, and remembered what I was taught and what I believed, I was aſtoniſhed with myſelf that ever I imbibed ſuch abſurd ideas; but the reaſon was, I never ſearched the ſcriptures to ſee if theſe things were ſo, but believed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived every thing I heard, without giving myſelf liberty to doubt the truth of it; but when I came to look and read for myſelf, the matter looks ſo plain and obvious that it ſeems as though I ſhould be guilty of impertinence to make any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon it, but ſhall leave every one to read and judge for themſelves.</p>
            <p>Now I ſhall leave this matter and obſerve ſome things which took place in the Church which gave me much affliction.</p>
            <p>We had ſome years before entered into covenant to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and ſupport a joint intereſt one with another, and agreed not to bring one another into debt for any ſervices or intereſt we ſhould beſtow to the joint intereſt of the Church. This was entered into in writtng, with our names ſubſcribed to it: but the meaning or intention of this thing as we underſtood it, was this, there had been a number that had left the people and come with great demands for wages, &amp;c.—Some of which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be very unjuſt, and brought diſtreſs upon the Church. This covenant therefore was intended to cut them off from making any demand, ſo that the Church might be able to do that which was juſt and equal in relation to them, without being brought into diſtreſs and ſo the matter was conducted for a number of years. When any one went away, the Deacons and Overſeers came to a ſettlement with them—paid them a
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:038359_0016_1011C9D5DA184088"/>certain ſum and took a final diſcharge: whether they did juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice or not. I do not pretend to ſay; but I had heard it inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated ſome time paſt, that the time would come when thoſe who went away from the Church would not be allowed any thing at all: however, I did not believe that ever I ſhould ſee that time come; it looked to me like ſuch barefaced injuſtice, that I could not think it would ever be preſumed upon. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was not a great while before the gift come ſure enough, and as it got among the Deacons before I had knowledge of it, it was divulged amongſt the family, which made no ſmall ſtir among them; and as they opened their trials to me in the matter, I labored to pacify them, telling them I did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it: however, I was determined to know the truth of it, and as I had an opportunity with the Miniſter, I opened what trials there was among the brethren, and deſired to know the truth of the matter. He was very free and open to diſcloſe the whole matter, and opened his faith freely—he ſaid he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that thoſe who went away and left the Church has no more right to receive any temporal property out of the Church as a compenſation for any labor or any intereſt they had bro't in, no more than Judas had a right to an inheritance with the Apoſtles after he had betrayed CHRIST. It was alledged that the intereſt or ſervice that was given, was given to God, and to take away that which was given to God would be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting <hi>ſacrilege.</hi> This indeed was pretty ſtrong meat for me, however, I thought I would not ſay any thing to bring myſelf into trouble: but being aſked the queſtion what my faith was in relation to the matter, I dared not be otherwiſe than an hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt man, ſo I opened my faith honeſtly. I told him I believed that if any one who had lived with us, and labored faithfully, and ſpent their ſtrength with us for a number of years, and finally, for ſome cauſe or other they choſe to go away and leave us, it was a righteous thing for us to give them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as a compenſation for their labour I told him if one who lived there with us that had a piece of land which he had given in to the joint intereſt, and afterwards ſaw fit to take himſelf away, I could not in conſcience feel any heart to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove that land, unleſs it was purchaſed of him, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the value of it. As to its being ſacrilege I could not conceive the matter to be ſo that what was given for Sacred Uſe and conſecrated to God for that purpoſe, to take it away might be called ſacrelege: But this ſeemed to me to be a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult thing: When we came together we brought what we had, and put it into the common ſtock, for the general benefit of all, not for others any more than for ourſelves, to be uſed equally, according to our daily needs, ſuch as eating, drinking, &amp;c. ſo that I could not ſee the propriety of ſaying it was all given up for Sacred uſe any more than our daily eating and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:038359_0017_1011C9D761A55F70"/>drinking, or any others temporal duty is ſacred. It was ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to me that the wicked did not deſerve any thing but judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which included all that were not of that profeſſion. It was told me they who went away from the Church to the world had what they went after; they had the fleſh and that was enough for them.</p>
            <p>In anſwer to what was ſaid of the wicked's not deſerving any thing, I ſaid, if a wicked man does me a day's work, it is as juſt and right for me to pay him, as though he had been a righteous man: alſo, I told them I did not know but the time might come when the people of God would have power to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute judgment, but I did not believe that the time had come yet, therefore, I queried thus; here is one of the brethren (mentioning his name) who has been here theſe 8 or 9 years, and has laboured faithfully—he has been a very ſtrong labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious young man and has done a great deal of good—by and by he gets diſcouraged, loſes his faith, or for ſome other cauſe, he chooſes to go away and leaves us. Well, we ſay, he har gone to the unclean and left the only means of his ſalvation and will have to ſuffer the judgment of God. Now, is not that enough for him to bear—do not we ought to feel ſorry for him, and pity him, or ſhall we try to make him as wretched and miſerable as we poſſibly can in this world, by depriving him of all the fruit of his labor which is neceſſary for his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance in this world? can this be right, or can any one who has a chriſtian ſpirit have a heart to do it?</p>
            <p>To repeat all the converſation we had upon this ſubject would be very lengthy and needleſs; but it coſt me a great deal of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction before I got through with it.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only further obſerve, that we compromiſed the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as well as we could. I admitted they that went away had no right to make any demand according to the covenant, and the matter ſeemed to be dropped as to its being ſin to give them any thing, and ſo we labored for union again. However, numbers not long after went away and left the Church, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, chiefly on that account; but they were ſettled with, and ſomething given to them for peace ſake, ſo as to get a final diſcharge from them, that would ſecure the Church from any controverſy in the law. This was a reſerve that was made that it might be right to ſacrifice ſomething, for peace ſake, rather than to enter into a controverſy that might bring the Church into trouble.</p>
            <p>Not far from this time (as I was continually exerciſed in tribulation which I was unable to keep undiſcovered, although the cauſe I labored to keep to myſelf; but doubtleſs it was obſerved that I did not preach up faith ſo ſtrong as I had done in times paſt, but labored to maintain union and reconciliation to the preſent gift and order that was for us,) being in company
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:038359_0018_1011C9DD5CF31648"/>with the Miniſters one evening, I was queſtioned reſpecting my faith. I was aſked whether I had a living witneſs in me, <hi>that this was the ſecond coming of</hi> CHRIST? I ſaid nay. I have not. My anſwer ſeemed to be very ſurpriſing and unexpected: however, they undertook to labor with me—I ſhewed my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in part; but the more they labored with me, the leſs ſaith I ſell, till I did not ſee but I ſhould looſe all I had got. The labor continued a day or two, till my tribulation was unutterable. I did not ſee but what I muſt give up my place as an Elder, for I always had a mortal averſion to hypocrites, and I did not ſee but what I had got to be one myſelf in ſome degree, although I was conſcious to myſelf that I had never done any intended wrong, not wilfully acted any thing that I knew was ſin, ſince the firſt of my profeſſion; but as I had not faith, without doubt, I was not able to preach faith to oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; however, viewing the conſequences that would naturally follow, I deſired to labour further, and accordingly went to the Miniſters and humbled myſelf, and begged their patience with me till I had labored for a further increaſe of faith. They ſeemed to be thankful for my reſolution and labored to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage me in it.</p>
            <p>But to return again to the labor I was in, to wit, in ſearching the ſcriptures to aſcertain whether the day and time had come, according to the teſtimony, of the ſecond appearing of Chriſt. I have already ſhewn that in ſome of the moſt eſſential points of our faith we were groſsly deceived, and there were many other things which I found to my ſatisfaction, were equally ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd. One thing I heard aſſerted not long ſince (by one who profeſſed to be my teacher) in the moſt poſitive terms that the Church was now in the new Jeruſalem ſtate. This appeared to me to be a deception, for in that ſtate it is plainly ſaid that God will wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there ſhall be no more death, neither ſorrow nor crying, neither ſhall there be any more pain, for the former things are paſſed away. The preſent ſtate of the Church ſeemed to me to be quite the reverſe from this, for there is both ſorrow, pain and death, and that to a greater degree than what there is among many other people; but this is called ſuffering with Chriſt: however it appears to me without all doubt that the ſole cauſe for the greateſt part of the ſufferings and deaths that have been among this people is intemperance. What propriety there is in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt has come in his glory with all the holy Angels with him, to reign as king upon Earth, and yet his Church be in a ſtate of ſufferings I do not pretend to ſay, but ſhall leave it for every one to judge for themſelves: but as I ſhall not have time to be particular in ſhewing my ideas on every paſſage of ſcripture which I have quoted, and have peruſed to my ſatisfaction. I ſhall only obſerve upon a
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:038359_0019_1011C9E190844198"/>few things which were ſpokon by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which I believe will be acknowledged to be the moſt ſure word of prophecy. In the 24th chapter of Matthew Chriſt gives a very particular account of what ſhould take place before his coming, and the manner of his coming; and in the 25th chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he tells what ſhould be after his coming—he ſignifies that before his coming there would be a great many ſounds and voices about religion; falſe prophets and falſe Chriſts ſhould ariſe and ſhew great ſigns and wonders &amp;c. Obſerve this was to be before his coming, not afterwards, "for (he ſays) as the light'ning cometh out of the Eaſt and ſhineth even unto the Weſt, ſo ſhall the coming of the ſon of man be;" there will be ſuch light and evidence manifeſted as will put the matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all controverſy, both with the juſt and unjuſt, for he ſays, "all the tribes of the Earth ſhall ſee him, &amp; ſhall mourn at hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> appearing. "Now it is held by ſome that the light'ning here ſpok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en of does not mean the <hi>electrical</hi> fire that come<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> out of the <hi>clouds,</hi> but the ſun that riſeth in the Eaſt, &amp; progreſſively increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es till it enlightens the whole Earth. Admitting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> be the caſe, it is no leſs evident that the ſecond coming of Chriſt will be with ſuch inconteſtible evidence, that all men will have to ſubmit to his government; for as the ſun riſes, the day appears, the darkneſs paſſes away, and every object that ſcarcely diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the night now appears clearly to be what it is; and as it is impoſſible for the ſun to riſe and not bring the day along with it, ſo it appears to be impoſſible, according to what is written, for the ſun of righteouſneſs to ariſe, and be ariſing more than f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ty years, and almoſt all the inhabitants of the Earth be entirely ignorant of it: but perhaps it may be ſaid it is poſſible for men to ſleep in the day, when the ſun does ſhine, and not know whether it be day or night; but Chriſt ſays, he ſhall ſend his Angels with a great ſound of a trumpet. This no doubt, will awaken every creature, for "all the tribes of the Earth ſhall mourn, and they ſhall ſee the ſon of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory." Perhaps it is needleſs for me to ſay that there never was more ſects and denominations of religion—and lo here! and lo there! than there is at this preſent time. This is a ſign that the day of Chriſt is at hand; but not that it has already come, and been come theſe fifty years.</p>
            <p>Now after Chriſt had ſpoken a conſiderable time in relation to his coming, and the manner of it, he tells us how it ſhould be after he had come; beginning at Matthew, 25th chapter and 31ſt verſe, where he ſays, "when the ſon of man ſhall come in his glory, and all the holy Angels with him, then ſhall he ſet upon the throne of his glory, and before him ſhall be gathered all nations, and he ſhall ſeparate them one from another, as a ſhhepherd divideth his ſheep from the goats, and he ſhall ſet
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:038359_0020_1011C9E7843554E0"/>ſheep on the right, but the goats on the left; then, ſhall the king ſay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o them on his right hand, come ye bleſſed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, for I was an hungred and ye gave me meat, &amp;c."</p>
            <p>This paragraph, or paſſage of ſcripture, came into my mind ſome days before I left the people in Hancock. I was under exceeding tribulation in my mind with reſpect to theſe things that I had been laboring in. I walked out into the garden to amuſe my mind ſome, with the natural creation; while I was walking in the garden it ſeemed to break forth into my mind, as though it was ſent by the inviſible power of him that ſpoke it firſt; the reaſon that was aſſigned for pronouncing the bleſſing was the matter that operated more eſſentially in my mind, "for I was a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> hungred and ye gave me meat:" it was not becauſe they were Shakers, or Quakers, or any one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſect or denomination; it was not becauſe they gave alms and ſounded a trumpet ſo as to have the praiſe of men; it was not becauſe they attended to a great many orders and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, for fear of puniſhment, expecting thereby to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a righteouſneſs. Nay, it was not all this. But what was it? It was becauſe they had received the ſpirit of the Lord Jeſus, which made them love to to good to their fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; it was becauſe they loved righteouſneſs, for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſake; it was becauſe they loved thoſe that hated them, and bleſſed thoſe that curſed them; and when they had done all, they could feel themſelves unprofitable ſervants, as it ſeems was the tenor of their language. They were ready to cry out, Lord where did we do ſuch and ſuch things? They felt as if they had done nothing that was ſufficient to make them worthy of any favor; but what they had done they did out of love to God, and therefore had made no account of it.</p>
            <p>Theſe meditations and contemplations ſeemed to carry me quite beyond the limits of my order. I forgot all my trouble, and almoſt forgot I was a Shaker; however, recollecting where and what I was, my trouble ſoon come on again; and as there was ſome things about that time that come forth as order, which I had not much faith in, ſo that I could not ſpeak it to the reſt as a matter of my own faith, which I was required to do, without wronging my conſcience. I came to a reſolution to relign my office, and not be a hypocrite any longer, let the event be as it would, though I was not determined to come away till I was further ſatisfied: I accordingly carried my my reſolution into effect and gave up my place as the Elder Brother, June 30th, and deſired no one to look to me for any help or any counſel as they had done, but to labor for my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf only, and be eſteemed as one of the leaſt of all. This I ſpoke to the family, and told them I felt myſelf quite come to
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:038359_0021_1011C9EB22FCA658"/>an end. and unable to be any further help to them; but did not tell the cauſe, in particular, for I was not allowed by any means to open my weakneſs or unbelief to the reft, reſpecting the foundation of our profeſſion. But the circumſtance of my religning my place ſeemed to be very ſhocking, and cauſed great agitations and anxiety of mind throughout the Church. My tribulation alſo was not at all leſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

            <p>However, as there was one appointed to ſupply the place which I had left, there was immediately great labor and pains taken to ſeperate the feelings of the Church from me, both by the Miniſters and Elders; and as this could not eaſily be done without finding ſomething againſt me, whereby it might be made to appear that I had been wicked, and gone contrary to the order of the Church. There was no pains ſpared in labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſearching to find ſome iniquity, both by examining me and many others, till finally it was thought they had found ſome thing worthy of admonition. I was labored with and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely admoniſhed, even for that which they themſelves would have juſtified. A few months before I was told I had got to come to ſuch and ſuch things or go to the world, &amp;c. I received the communication without making much reply, and told them I ſhould conſider of it I but notwithſtanding, I had felt many times as though I could go away and leave them with as much peace of conſcience as ever I lay down to ſleep as to any faith I had that bound me there; yet, when I come to bring the matter near and realize it, to forſake the people which I ſo loved, and had ſo long maintained ſuch a near re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and intimate union with, and with whom I had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable ſubſiſtance, with reſpect to temporal things, and ſeek me a place among ſtrangers, it ſeemed as though I had rather give up my life and go into eternity; for my natural relations were as much ſtrangers to me at the reſt of mankind, for from the firſt of my faith, there was no one to my knowledge that labored more effectually to reject and ſhut out their natural relations than myſelf: and having been very bold and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous to teſtily many things to them, which I had good reaſon to believe were dictated by the ſpirit of <hi>error,</hi> and that which I ſhould have to acknowledge was falſe and abſurd; and alſo in treating them with ſuch unnatural contempt. that I felt as though I ſhould never have confidence to aſk of them any favor.</p>
            <p>In conſideration of theſe things and feeling my heart and affections ſo bound up in the family whore I lived, that I
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:038359_0022_1011C9EEF3E412A8"/>choſe to ſubmit to any thing that was required of me, as far as I was able and not ſin againſt my own conſcience, not ſeeing any thing but what I muſt ſoon leave this world, for my appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite to food was all gone, ſo that I was able to take very out lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle for my nouriſhment; and there was ſuch a pain in my heart, almoſt continually, that it ſeemed ſome times as though it would burſt aſunder; and all the remedy I could find was weeping and crying to God—and this was ſo troubleſome to the Miniſters and Elders (it having ſuch an effect upon thoſe that had tender feelings) that I was diſallowed weeping before the family, or indeed, any where elſe; however I was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to refrrin all the time; but when my heart was in ſuch pain that I could endure it no longer. I would take myſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone and weep and pray to God till I was in ſome meaſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed; but my tribulation ſtill continued as conſtant as my breath, though the family was exceeding kind and tender to me, and were willing to help me to every thing I needed as to temporal ſupport, and would often try to comfort me in my ſpirit, but it was all in vain—alſo the Miniſters and Elders frequently labored with me, to help my faith; but that was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually in vain; for the more they labored with me, the more I was ſatisfied we were all upon a wrong foundation, and ſhould at laſt be found falſe witneſſes before God. It appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed evident to me that my feelings to the people and family where I lived was partial, and that which was acquired by a long habit of intimacy, more than by the true love of God, which is univerſal to all that believe in Chriſt. Viewing things to be ſo I was unwilling to ſtay there and die, for death appeared to me not far diſtant, as my body was reduced almoſt to a ſkeliton, and my natural ſtrength almoſt exhauſted; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I believed it was my duty to change my condition by coming away and leaving them, and renouncing that which I believed was error: but the croſs I had to take up for that purpoſe I believe was ſeven fold greater than it was to forſake my father's houſe and join that people at firſt—however I gathered up as much reſolution as I could, and accompliſhed my purpoſe the 24th of July, 1799, by bidding them farewell, and leaving the place. As to my feelings ſince that time, I ſhall only obſerve, that notwithſtanding I was at a loſs for ſome time whether I ſhould live or die, my health was ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired. I have not ſeen one moment that I was ſorry I came away, let it be to my honor or diſhonor; but I am fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that I have been under the power of deception and was led by he ſpirit of error, as to the main principles of faith that I ſet out upon: but my preſent feeling and determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to turn to the good and the right way, which is the new and living way, pointed out by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and make it the rule of my liſe and conduct.</p>

               </gap>o addreſs myſelf in a few words, to thoſe who have or may hereafter come away from the people called Shakers. There has been numbers who have left that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whoſe conduct, I am ſorry to ſay, has been more wicked &amp; prophane than the reſt of mankind in general. This is made uſe of by the Shakers (as ſome of you well know) as an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that they are the only people of God; applying that ſcripture in Matthew 12th, 43d, &amp;c. where it ſpeaks of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean ſpirit going out of a man, and afterwards he takes ſeven other ſpirits more wicked than himſelf, &amp;c. This is applied to all that leave them. They ſuppoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that they are going to be ſeven times more wicked than ever they were before; or, at leaſt, all that leave them and deny any faith in them: but for my part I do not feel under any obligation to be wicked, becauſe they think it muſt be ſo: neither do I feel any lack of the protection of God from the power of evil any more than ever I did; but I feel as fully determined, by the help of God, to do juſtice, love mercy, and walk humbly with God, as ever I did in any part of my life—and as there are numbers of you that have lived with me, and have heard me ſpeak a great deal againſt the fleſh, &amp;c. and likely would be glad to hear from me now, in relation to the matter, I would juſt let you know that I feel as much againſt the works of the fleſh, which is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the ſcriptures, as ever I did: but the ordinance and convenant of marriage, between male and female, which was ordained of God, in the garden of Eden before the fall; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it is the gift of God now as really as ever it was; but as I have not time to be particular in this matter, I would refer you to a book, written by my ingenious friend, DANIEL RATHBONE, which was publiſhed ſome years ago, where the matter is fairly and ingeniouſly laid open. But there is anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er thing which I deſire to be a little particular in, reſpecting ſome that have left the Shakers, and have diſhonored themſelves by bad behaviour Although wickedneſs is inexcuſable when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over it is found, yet ſometimes by knowing what the cauſe is, we may be able to make ſome allowance for the effect. Now in the beginning of our faith there was a great many young children among the believers, which lived chiefly with their parents for a number of years, and the chief part of the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they had was to ſing and dance and labor for mortification. Finally there was a great number gathered to the Church, where they were put under the care of a Miniſter, appointed for that purpoſe They were diſallowed to have any books that was proper to inſtruct the mind into the principles of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Their teaching was ſuch as might be expected from thoſe who rejected the ſcriptures, reaſon, and common ſenſe, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repugnant to the Goſpel. They were, doubtleſs, ſome of them very vicious in their natures, and ungovernable, therefore
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:038359_0024_1011C9F7D5CCDB38"/>it ſeemed neceſſary to uſe violent means to ſubject them to obedience. This appeared barbarous and cruel, and only ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated their feelings to greater oppoſition. Finally they broke out of their bondage, and went off to the world one after another. Now being taught from their infancy that their was no other people that ſerved God but the Shakers, and not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any opportunity to learn any thing to the contrary, they did not know but it was ſo; and not being able to endure the diſcipline in the Church, they renounced that religion; togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with all the reſt upon Earth, determining to take their own way, without fearing God or regarding man. Being bred up ſo entirely ignorant of all the principles of morality, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come eaſy victims to all manner of evil.—Others there are, who had arrived to the years of underſtanding before they joined the Shakers, and have ſince left them, and made a ſad figure in the world. Thoſe I apprehend are ſuch as never had any principles of righteouſneſs in them, but joined the people out of ſome ſelfiſh motives; and not finding their purpoſe anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, return back to their old courſe with an increaſe of evil. Now, my friends, as we have made a very extraordinary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and exalted ourſelves above the reſt of mankind, and have found ourſelves deceived; do not let us be diſcouraged of trying to ſerve God at all; but let us remember that the day will come when we ſhall all receive a reward according to our works.</p>
            <p>Now a few words to thoſe whom I have called my brethren and ſiſters, to wit, the Church in Hancock, called Shakers; although I do not expect you will be allowed by your miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to read what I have here written, yet it may be poſſible that ſome of you may chance to ſee it, which if you do, you will find the real cauſe of my coming away from you; for as I was not allowed to open my mind to any one but thoſe who labord with me, it was impoſſible for you to know the cauſe of my affliction fully or the reaſon of my leaving you: but thanks be to God, I am now where I have liberty to open my mind without fearing the diſpleaſure of mortals; but as I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the common proceeding among you in relation to thoſe that come away from you, I ſhall not be diſappointed to find myſelf exceedingly hated b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now theſe things I ſpeak not to reproach you; but my deſire is that you might ſee the ſpirit of <hi>error</hi> by which you are led and renounce it, and embrace the ſimple doctrines which w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> taught by Chriſt and the Apoſtles. But there is one thing which hath come to my ears that I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand came from ſome of you, to which, it appears to me, I cannot do juſtice to myſelf without making ſome reply.</p>
            <p>I have underſtood it has been intimated that while I lived in the Church and profeſſed to be ſtrong in faith, that I lived in unlawful connexion with a certain woman, which is ſince my wife Now this appears to me to be mean and ill uſage, and beneath the Church of Chriſt, even if it was true. You may remember, doubtleſs, ſome of you, what I ſpoke to you a few days before I come away—I told you if any of you had any thing againſt me, or knew any wickedneſs of me to tell me of it before I came away, ſo that I might confeſs it and leave it with you, and not ſerve me as you did the reſt, as ſoon as they were gone, then to try to rake up every thing you could againſt them. Now why was you not ſo kind, if you knew theſe things, as to tell me of it while I was there, for I preſume you knew as much about it then as you do now. However I will tell you the ſimple truth, as I expect to anſwer in to God my creator. From the time that I firſt profeſſed chriſtianity (which was a year or two before I heard of the people called Shakers) to this day, I never have had any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful connexion with any wom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n, nor never in the courſe of my life did I ever defile myſelf with ſtrange fleſh; and from the time I firſt knew the Shakers to this time, I never defiled myſelf with what is called among you <hi>effeminacy;</hi> neither did I ever know by any certain knowledge, while I lived with you, that there was any females in the Church or any where elſe, except it was at the time when there was ſuch a gift for men and women to ſtrip naked and go into the water together, &amp;c. I was ſome times a ſpectator, and perhaps might obſerve the difference; but as to the wom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n which is now my wife, I
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:038359_0026_1011C9FDD40503E8"/>never knew whether ſhe was male or female till after I was le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally married to her; and as to my making any agreement with her to come away from the Church, I never did, firſt nor laſt, for I never ſpoke a ſingle word to her about one thing or another, after I was determined to come away, till a few min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utes before I came away; then I ſpoke with her and gave her the offer of my friendſhip and protection, if God ſpared my life, if it was her choice to follow me.</p>
            <p>Now there are ſome things which I have hinted that many of you are ignorant of, which I feel it my duty to open more plainly. It is well known to you that the foundation of our hope was built upon our faith in the firſt Mother, William Leas and James Whittaker, believing that they were redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from all ſin and were equal unto the Angels of God. I have hinted ſomething about the contention there was among them; now I will tell you what I ſaw with my own eyes, I was at <hi>Niſkauna</hi> with the Mother and the Elders. At length there was a contention broke out, which ſeemed chiefly to be between the Mother and William Leas; it kept increaſing till there was nothing but clamor and confuſion. Finally the Mother fell to beating William Leas—ſmiting of him in the face—he tried to defend off her blows, threatening to ſmite her if ſhe did not let him alone. There was a number of people preſent, who, moſt of them, ſeemed to join with the Mother, and labored to keep William Leas from hurting her, for there was awful threatning on both ſides; however the mother would not let him alone, but notwithſtanding his activity in defending himſelf would very often get a blow at him, till his face was in a gore of blood: at length, as he could endure it no longer, he ſmote her with his fiſt, and being a very ſtrong man I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that he hurt her very much, but ſhe did not fall quite to the floor, if I remember right, the people being ſo thick held her up. I ſtood the chief part of time not more than five or ſix feet from them, and ſaw the whole of what I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, and I think I have not exaggerated it one mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>l, but have rather come ſhort; for as I have had conſiderable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity in the courſe of my life both in the army among ſoldiers and elſewhere, I never ſaw any contention that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared more contrary to the Goſpel: notwithſtanding, at that time, my faith and imagination w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> ſuch, that I dared not judge there was any thing in the Mother that was wrong: but ſince I have found by inconteſtible evidence that I have been deceived, and have given myſelf liberty to exerciſe the rational faculties that God has created in me, it appears to me that the Mother, at that time, was very much overcome with ſtrong liquor, and was under the influence and power of Satan; and there is ſome among you now, or at leaſt was the laſt I heard from them, that can ſay, if they would be honeſt, that I have
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:038359_0027_1011CA02C602F0C0"/>ſpoke but a little part of what they ſee and heard from time to time, as they had more opportunity than I There is one among you, or was when I came away, that told me a few months ago that he was there at the time I was and lived there ſome time after: he ſignified they were in contention almoſt continually; ſometimes between the Mother and William Leas, and ſometime between the Mother and James Whittaker —he told as to their language, there never was a ſailor ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped on board a ſhip that exceeded them—he told me the Mother charged Whittaker with committing whoredom with a certain woman; Whittaker declared his innocence, &amp;c— This man that told me this I ſuppoſe is now among you and means to ſtay, for aught that I know; but you yourſelves, ſome of you, believe, or at leaſt have believed, that there is ſome among you who are in Authority, that are no more Shakers in heart and principle than the reſt of the world, but ſtay among you out of ſelfiſh motives.</p>
            <p>There is many things I ſhould be glad to ſay to you, but as I expect it is unlikely many of you will ever ſee what I have wrote ſo long as you remain in your bondage, I ſhall cloſe my matter by juſt obſerving, that my experience among the Shakers appears to me like a man that has been following an <hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> which is ſomething which he ſuppoſes to be light, and ſets out to go to it, but never gets any nearer to it, but follows it till he is led into a diſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>al wilderneſs of darkneſs, and then it diſappears; ſo it ſeems has been the caſe with me. It appears to me that I turned my eyes off from that light which God had appointed for ſouls to look to, and thought I ſee a light ſome where elſe, but in following after it I found it was always out vonder, till finally it led me into a diſmal ſwamp, and then diſappeared, where I had to get out as well as I could; but I am thankful to God that I have ſo far got out that I hope I am able, in ſome meaſure, to diſcover things as they be; and may God grant that you all may receive the ſame help and grace of God to bring you out of your darkneſs into the true light of the glorious Goſpel of the Son of God, ſo that you may be happy in this world and that which is to come, which is the ſincere deſire of</p>
