            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WE have numbered more than twenty-ſeven years ſince your oppoſition to a foreign ſyſtem of heavy oppreſſion began. The year 1764 has been rendered memorable, on the one ſide by the folly and injuſtice of a hated ſtamp-act, and, on the other, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting energy of the patriot ſons of Freedom. From that period, the genius of American liberty, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating diſtreſs, miſery, and hoſts of enemies, waxed ſtrong in her own defence, and hath crowned more than THREE MILLIONS of mankind with national in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence.—Inſtructed in the ſchool of Freedom, the inhabitants of theſe confederate States combined their ſtrength in the protection of the rights of men. THEY KNEW AND THEY FELT THAT FREEMEN WILL BE FREE. By their exertions, under the favour of a righteous providence, they have eſtabliſhed a wiſe conſtitution of federal government: they have reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:023358_0004_0FBF3D6AA237EEF8"/>
the conſummation of every patriot's wiſh, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and felicity of their country; and now enjoy a free ſyſtem of political happineſs, ſuch as gives plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and even tranſport, to the enlightened patriots of many nations; and has made, perhaps, no ſmall advancement of joy among the benevolent hoſts of Heaven: for, to every benevolent and virtuous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the freedom and happineſs of the human race is a moſt pleaſing conſideration.—But there are ſome men, with the means of public proſperity in their poſſeſſion, who do not realize the value of Freedom: they partake of the common bleſſings of a free peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and yet are not conſcious of national felicity.—This, however, does not leſſen the real worth of Lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty; for in every ſituation of life, it is the richeſt inheritance. In true Liberty is included, Freedom, both moral and civil; it has nothing in contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but the happineſs of mankind, and therefore it is the principal glory of man; and, in this world, there can be nothing more dignified, or more exalted. Without civil and religious Liberty, man is indeed a poor, enſlaved, wretched, miſerable creature; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his life, nor his property, nor the uſe of his conſcience, is ſecured to him; but he is ſubjected to ſome inhuman tyrant, whoſe will is his law, and who <hi>preſumes to govern men without their conſent.</hi>—But let not this gale of honeſt zeal carry us beyond the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection of our text.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:023358_0005_0FBF3D7060F29200"/>
IN the diſcuſſion of the text, it may be obſerved, that the word LIBERTY, in this place, does princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally imply a freedom from the injunctions of the ceremonial law. This freedom our Saviour purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for all Chriſtians; and in this freedom the apoſtle Paul exhorted the Galatians, and all the followers of Chriſt, to <hi>ſtand faſt.</hi> When we conſider the age, and ſtate of the world, in which the Jews lived, and their fondneſs of ſhow, idolatry, and ſuperſtition, we ſhall find that their religion was well ſuited to their genius and temper. The religion of the Jews had a very pointed alluſion to the character and office of the Meſſiah, and was therefore wiſely enjoined. But thoſe typical and ritual ſervices, after the coming of Chriſt, having fulfilled their deſign, became unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. "Theſe, ſaid the apoſtle Paul, were a ſhadow of things to come; but the body is of Chriſt, who hath aboliſhed the law of commandments contained in ordinances." Without the external pomp and ſhow of the Jewiſh religion, the goſpel recommends the worſhip of God in ſpirit and truth. The doctrines of the goſpel are calculated to promote good will and liberty among men; and where their genuine influence has been extended, mankind have been ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered more happy: they have been inſtructed, civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized, humanized, and made free. "The wiſdom that is from above is firſt pure, then peaceable, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:023358_0006_0FBF3D71C7E42828"/>
and eaſy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocriſy."—<hi>The true ſpirit of the Goſpel contains the true ſpirit of Liberty.</hi> We may be aſſured, that under this benev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent inſtitution, uſeful liberty of every kind is rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ommended by the ſpirit of our text.</p>
            <p>ALTHO my text, in the original meaning, did not reſpect civil ſo much as religious liberty, yet I hope I ſhall not ſeem to miſuſe it by making it the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a diſcourſe on Liberty in general.</p>
            <p>A FEW obſervations on the nature of religious Liberty, ſhall conſtitute the <hi>firſt</hi> part of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
            <p>I. RELIGIOUS Liberty is a divine right, immediately derived from the Supreme Being, without the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of any created authority. It is the natural privilege of worſhipping God in that manner which, according to the judgment of men, is moſt agreeable and pleaſing to the divine character. As the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of man is the image and repreſentative of God in the human ſoul; ſo to him alone it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſible. In juſtice, therefore, the feelings and ſentiments of conſcience, and the moral practice of religion, muſt be independent of all finite beings. Nor hath the all-wiſe Creator inveſted any order of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:023358_0007_0FBF3D73431B41F0"/>
men with the right of judging for their fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the great concerns of religion. Truth and religion are ſubjects of determination entruſted to all men; and it is a privilege of all men to judge and determine for themſelves.</p>
            <p>RELIGIOUS Liberty ſecures every man, both in his perſon and property, from ſuffering on account of his peculiar ſentiments in religion; and no practice which flows purely from this fountain of natural right can juſtly be puniſhed. But when a man adopts ſuch notions as, in their practice, counteract the peace and good order of ſociety, be then perverts and abuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the original Liberty of man; and were he to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for thus diſturbing the peace of the community, and injuring his fellow-citizens, his puniſhment would be inflicted not for the exerciſe of a virtuous principle of conſcience, but for violating that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal law of rectitude and benevolence which was intended to prevent one man from injuring another. To puniſh men for entertaining various religious ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, is to aſſume a power to puniſh them for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what God gave them an unalienable right to do. For neither the principles of reaſon, nor the doctrines of the goſpel, which are the perfection of reaſon, have empowered any man to judge for himſelf and for another man alſo: this is religious tyranny; this
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:023358_0008_0FBF3D7BE3F48B48"/>
is to controul another man's conſcience: and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul any man's conſcience is to contradict that true principle of eternal juſtice which Jeſus Chriſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed to the world: <hi>Therefore, all things whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SUFFER me a little to illuſtrate this maxim of primitive juſtice. We will ſuppoſe, that ſome man ſhould endeavour to prove, that he had a right to determine what our religious principles and ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ought to be; but ¿how would he be pleaſed when his own arguments ſhould be turned againſt himſelf? Should this man, who was unwilling to allow us the free exerciſe of rational, accountable creatures, be forced, in the change of human affairs, to reſide among a people very different from him in matters of religion; he however behaving himſelf as an honeſt and peaceable man, and, as a good ſubject of civil ſociety, ſerving the intereſt of the country; ¿ would he not think it very unjuſt and tyrannical to be perſecuted for his religious opinions—impriſoned, deprived of his property, and finally condemned to die, only becauſe he could not with a clear conſcience worſhip as they did? Only the Supreme Governour of mankind has a perfect right to receive the homage of the human mind; it is his peculiar prerogative to controul the conſciences of men by his infinitely
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:023358_0009_0FBF3D7D0A072B50"/>
wiſe and equitable laws. True religion muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be founded in the inward perſuaſion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the mind; for without this it cannot be that <hi>reaſonable ſervice</hi> which is pleaſing to God. The human underſtanding cannot be convinced by exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal violence of any kind; nor can the immaterial ſpirit be influenced by the laws of men, unleſs they correſpond with the goodneſs, juſtice, and mercy, of our bleſſed Creator, our moſt bountiful Benefactor, and our all wiſe and righteous Judge.—Here joy and gratitude prompt me to ſay, Oh happy people, who live in this land and in this age of religious Lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty! here every man has equally the freedom of chooſing his religion; and may <hi>ſit every man under his vine, and under his figtree; and,</hi> on the account of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, <hi>none ſhall make them afraid.</hi> Let us, my friends and fellow-citizens, <hi>Stand faſt, therefore, in the</hi> relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious <hi>Liberty wherewith</hi> God and <hi>Chriſt hath made us free.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. WITH ſubmiſſion to the profeſſional knowledge of my political Fathers, I will now venture to make ſome obſervations on the nature and principles of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Liberty. Theſe obſervations ſhall be included within the following particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. IN this happy land of light and liberty, it is a truth fully eſtabliſhed, that all men are by nature
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:023358_0010_0FBF3D7F66A923F8"/>
equally free. From this principle of natural Liberty we derive an indefeaſible right of being governed by our own civil conſtitutions. WE THE PEOPLE are the ſource of all legiſlative authority. Upon this juſt, benevolent, pleaſing, and even delightful prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, the conſtitutions, the laws, and the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of theſe federal States, will <hi>ſtand faſt.</hi> All men who underſtand the nature, and feel the ſpirit, of ſuch principles, are ſelf-inſtructed to be their own Legiſlators, either in one collected body, or by rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſentation. When all the people can aſſemble, and perſonally contribute their aid in framing conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and laws for the government of themſelves, then their liberty is moſt natural and moſt perfect. But ſince great loſs of time, much expenſe, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inconveniences, would attend this mode of legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, the people have agreed, in free States, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect from the whole body, ſome of their brethren, whom they inveſt with legiſlative power. What ſhall be tranſacted by theſe delegates or repreſentatives, conſiſtently with the conſtitution of the people, muſt be acknowledged as the act of the people. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to this plan, the people keep as near the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of natural Liberty, as is convenient and real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſeful; and while they are truly virtuous, they will enjoy as much perfect Liberty as is neceſſary to preſerve peace, eſtabliſh juſtice, and ſecure political
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:023358_0011_0FBF3D818A45F588"/>
happineſs.—I ſhall only add further, under this particular, that when a free people have, according to their conſtitution, determined to legiſlate by rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſentatives, they ſhould take great care that the rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſentation may be fully adequate to the importance and welfare of the people; the elections ſhould alſo be perfectly free, and ſufficiently frequent.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE elections ſhould be conducted agreeably to the principles of juſtice and honour. The privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of electing freely, or being freely elected, is one of the faireſt features in the pure image of natural Liberty. A free and unbiaſſed election of the beſt and the wiſeſt men, is a certain evidence of the flour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing ſtate of Liberty.—On the other hand, when elections are under diſhoneſt influence, and men can be ſold and bought, it is a moſt lamentable ſign that Liberty is either in a deep ſleep, or in a dangerous decay. When this <hi>birth-right</hi> of the people is bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered for ſomething as mean as a meſs of <hi>pottage</hi>—when they neglect and deſpiſe this natural and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional right—they then loſe their ſhare and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in that government of which they were the orig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inal foundation. Having neglected that ſecurity which at firſt exiſted in themſelves, and having coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teracted the very deſign of that ſocial compact which was intended to ſecure them from every ſpecies of political injury, they turn TRAITORS to their God
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:023358_0012_0FBF3D874E444C48"/>
who made them free; and for want of exerciſing that natural power which their Creator gave them, their <hi>glory will depart:</hi> and, having the hearts of ſlaves, they will wear the livery and endure the miſery of ſlaves.—But I am not willing to ſpend time in repreſenting this horrible image of ſlaviſh miſery. This aſſembly is the image and repreſentation of a free ſtate. I have the honour, I have the felicity, of ſpeaking before men who are too well acquainted with the bleſſings of Liberty to neglect or deſpiſe any of the natural or conſtitutional rights of freemen.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE public happineſs of a people is promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not only by the freedom of elections, but alſo by the wiſdom and goodneſs of the laws. A wiſe and a good repreſentation will produce good laws. Good and wiſe men, who are clothed with the natural power of their conſtituents, will ſtudy to unite cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the intereſt of the country and the power of the laws; and where the repreſentation is good, the laws will appear to carry with them the voice and common conſent of the people. The laws made after this manner, are the laws of the people, and prove that they are free, and that they virtually legiſlate for themſelves.—I leave this particular, after ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, that the public happineſs ſhould be the firſt duty and the prime object of all legiſlators; and that, in every free and virtuous ſtate, this is the pole-ſtar of legiſlation.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:023358_0013_0FBF3D8847796FD8"/>
4. IT is the duty of the people, in conformity to the principles of Liberty, to chooſe men to ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the executive department of the nation: for no man, in a free ſtate, can juſtly claim the authority of an executive magiſtrate, without the voice and conſent of the people. In the exerciſe of their own natural power, by their conſtitution, they muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point their chief magiſtrate to this place of honour and truſt. In this reſpect, it may be ſaid, that the people do not only make their laws, but they alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute them, and govern themſelves. Theſe conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations ſhould have a tendency to diſcourage all offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of government from feeling themſelves inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of their brethren, THE PEOPLE. With theſe proper views, they will be more likely to pay that attention to the wants and feelings of the people, which is neceſſary to increaſe the public happineſs. When, therefore, the moſt exalted characters in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority feel themſelves connected to the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity by a brotherly, benevolent attachment; then the lives and the eſtates of the nation are moſt ſecure. In addition to this, it may alſo be ſaid, that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of men in power will then be the moſt uſeful and honourable, when the affairs of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are conducted with moderation and juſtice: for the people have not appointed men to inſult and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure them, but to promote their beſt intereſt. Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:023358_0014_0FBF3D8A9A194640"/>
&amp; compulſion will never advance the happineſs of freemen. They will know when they are govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed agreeably to their conſtitutions and laws: they will know when they enjoy a portion of that civil proſperity which they are entitled to by their rights and privileges: and they will eaſily know when they are treated with civility and kindneſs. The people ſhould have reaſon to believe, that men in office have nothing more at heart than the felicity of the nation.</p>
            <p n="5">5. THE beſt meaſures ſhould be adopted to eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh eſteem and confidence between the people and their rulers; for without this favourable impreſſion, there will be but little peace and ſatisfaction in the public mind. Great care ſhould be taken not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb and irritate the temper of the people; their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience ſhould never be tortured; but they ſhould have as many reaſons to be pleaſed with the tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of government, as poſſible, conſiſtent with the public welfare: for good humour and ſatisfaction greatly contribute to the peace and happineſs of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and mankind. When the people have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſatisfaction and reſt of mind, they will be more induſtrious, and conſequently more virtuous: the produce of the land will be more plentiful; and the ſtrength and reſources of the nation will be in proportion to the pleaſure and encouragement of the mind. A free, willing, induſtrious, and virtuous
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:023358_0015_0FBF3D8CCA8705C8"/>
people, well united and well pleaſed, are the ſtrength of a nation; while the great wealth of a few lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urious, idle drones, are the great bane of Liberty.—A people with that happy temper of mind which I have deſcribed, will be cheerfully obedient to their laws; they will reſpect and eſteem all their good civ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>il officers; and peace and harmony will be pleaſant and laſting.—The man, whom every benevolent, free and virtuous citizen reſpects and loves, ſuffer me to adorn my humble page with the name of WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON, hath declared, that, THE BEST WAY TO PRESERVE THE CONFIDENCE OF THE PEOPLE DURABLY IS TO PROMOTE THEIR TRUEST INTEREST.</p>
            <p n="6">6. THE principles of a free people are directly oppoſed to taxation without their own conſent by rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſentation. Money ſhould never be extorted by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, but received as the gifts and free will offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or contributions of the people, to pay for the ſecurity of their perſons and property. Let them be convinced, that the public demands are reaſonable and neceſſary, not merely for the benefit of civil offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, but for the general advantage of the nation; and then as a free, enlightened, generous, virtuous people, they will take pleaſure cheerfully to defray the neceſſary expenſes of government. They will be pleaſed when they recollect, that for a very ſmall portion of their property they can be ſecured in the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:023358_0016_0FBF3D944751AC28"/>
real poſſeſſion of all the bleſſings of true Liberty.—But how will their pleaſure riſe ſtill higher, when they conſider, that by doing juſtice to their brethren, to whom they have committed the toils and dangers of public buſineſs; when they conſider, I ſay, that by their contributions they advance not only the great proſperity of the nation, but include alſo their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity in the general happineſs. But here let it be obſerved, that no requiſitions ſhould be made but ſuch as are really and abſolutely neceſſary for the ſupport and contingencies of government; and of the expenditure of money the people ſhould have an account. Much the greater part of mankind toil ſeverely for what property they acquire: it would therefore be very unjuſt and cruel to uſe it for the gratification of pampered pride and luxury. In a word, that government which improves the intereſt and happineſs of the people, and manages their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic affairs conſiſtently with the principles of a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous oeconomy, as well as a juſt and <hi>magnanimous policy,</hi> free from a prodigal and diſhoneſt waſte of the public wealth; ſuch a government will furniſh the moſt reaſonable ſatisfaction, and will be the moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued and the moſt bravely defended.</p>
            <p>III. UNDER this head of diſcourſe, I will endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to ſhew when it may be ſaid that a people <hi>ſtand faſt in the Liberty wherewith</hi> they are <hi>free.</hi> With the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:023358_0017_0FBF3D95CC541CD8"/>
proſecution of this deſign, I will attempt to intermix the ſpirit and freedom of an APPLICATION.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE people are in the habit and exerciſe of Liberty, when they reſort to the firſt principles of government, and trace their rights up to God the Creator: when they exerciſe their natural power of framing any ſocial compact conducive to the common intereſt: feel independent of all human power but that which flows from themſelves: diſdain the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of their conſciences to any authority but the will of God: refuſe to be controuled by the will of any man who claims an independent power of diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their lives and eſtates: recollect that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into ſociety to have their natural rights, which are the baſis of civil rights, ſecured. To maintain ſuch principles of original juſtice, is to <hi>ſtand faſt</hi> in the righteous Liberty of man. True Liberty ſuffers no man to be injured in his perſon, eſtate, or charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: it encourages and enables him to improve hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> happineſs; and, within the limits of the public good, inſures to him every bleſſing to which imperfect hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature can attain. All the toils, ſufferings, treaſure and blood of men, are not loſt, when they are the price and purchaſe of Liberty. Without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and civil Liberty, we can have no ſecurity of life, or of any of the good things of God: we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not practice the ſentiments of our conſciences:—
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:023358_0018_0FBF3D97557CA7F8"/>
but where the rights of man are equally ſecured in the greateſt degree, there is the greateſt happineſs—AND THAT IS OUR COUNTRY.</p>
            <p n="2">2. WHEN you carefully regard the election of your repreſentatives and officers of government, you will <hi>ſtand faſt</hi> in your Liberty. It is a darling priv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilege of all freemen to elect the beſt qualified men to repreſent them in a State or National Aſſembly. But ¿do a people <hi>ſtand faſt</hi> in the diſcharge of their duty—are they in the exerciſe of their civil rights, when they neglect to chooſe men of eſtabliſhed principles of Virtue and Liberty? ¿ Do they wiſh to have good laws, and yet neglect to chooſe men who have proved themſelves friends to the rights of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren? ¿Can they reaſonably expect that good laws will proceed from men who <hi>fear not God nor regard man?</hi> ¿ Will men, who feel no obligations of love and duty to their Creator, be good examples to their conſtituents? ¿Will they add any weight to the laws they aſſiſted to make, when they are ſo prompt to violate them? ¿Do they not, as far as their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence will reach, defeat the very laws they voted for? ¿Will a public and patriotic ſpirit originate from vicious principles? ¿Is it natural for noble and generous ſentiments to flow from vice? ¿Do not bad principles make men ſelfiſh, narrow the mind, and baniſh all benevolent propenſities of doing
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:023358_0019_0FBF3D9F07627120"/>
good to men? ¿Will not the very knowledge which unprincipled men may have, degenerate into ſelfiſh low cunning, and ſerve only to embarraſs and perplex the honeſty and good common ſenſe of men who are able and willing to promote the intereſt of ſociety?—I need not tell you, that men under the influence of ſelfiſh paſſions, will ſacrifice the beſt intereſt of their country, whenever they can greatly advance their own importance; and, like a Dean and an Arnold, by the moſt infamous and horrible treaſon, betray that Liberty which they once pretended to defend.—Do any of the people aſk me, as one of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ¿ Who are the men we muſt chooſe, in order to <hi>ſtand faſt</hi> in our Liberty? Firſt, ſeparate, in your minds, the moſt wicked and unprincipled men, from being objects of your choice; and then, out of the reſt, ſelect men of underſtanding, for of ſuch there will enough remain, who are actuated by principles of love and obedience to God, and animated by a generous benevolence to mankind; who really love to ſee their brethren free and happy: for in this ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery benevolent man muſt take pleaſure. Benevolent principles will produce the nobleſt acts of public and patriotic good; they will enable men to diſcern eaſily the advantage of the people. "For when private intereſt and private views are removed, it will be eaſy to know what is the public good."—Let me beſeech
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:023358_0020_0FBF3DA0479FD3F8"/>
all the people to remember, that their ſafety and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in ſociety depends upon the election of good and wiſe repreſentatives. Under the ſmiles of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, the proſperity of a free people is in their own hands; for they have knowledge enough, if well improved, to advance and ſecure their welfare. In a few words, chooſe the men to manage your pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic affairs, to whom you would not fear to entruſt the moſt important concerns of a private nature.—This is the way to <hi>ſtand faſt</hi> in your Liberty.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE example of civil officers has great influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on the minds of mankind. They ought to be punctual in their obſervation of the laws of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. As public men, or private citizens, they ſhould be uniform in the practice of virtue, and the defence of Liberty. The people call them FATHERS: we are willing to be their political children, as long as they are good parents. But, ¿ Should not fathers be examples of goodneſs to their children? ¿Will children do well, if the parents are wicked and do wrong? ¿Will the children be obedient to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic laws, if the parents violate them? ¿Will the children love Freedom, if the parents diſregard it? ¿Will the children cultivate a public ſpirit, if the parents are ſelfiſh? ¿Do fathers love their children, and not ſtrive in all reſpects to promote their felicity? It is moſt reaſonable, therefore, to conclude, that it
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:023358_0021_0FBF3DA1CC4DA0B0"/>
is the great and indiſpenſible duty of rulers to encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age the practice of religion by their own influence and example: and I venture to declare, that no civil officer does the half of his duty, unleſs he endeavours to ſuppreſs vice and diſorder, and ſo prevent the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of puniſhment. Mankind very quickly and juſtly exclaim againſt the abſurdity of allowing thoſe men to be teachers of religion, who live in the habit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual practice of vice and wickedneſs: ¿Shall we not, with equal juſtice, condemn the practice of thoſe men who break through thoſe reſtraints which were intended to ſuppreſs vice, and conſequently encourage virtue? ¿Should they not be <hi>miniſters of God for good</hi> to the people, in every poſſible way? Every man of common ſenſe acknowledges, that religion is very uſeful to mankind; and eſpecially the precepts and truths of the goſpel. It is alſo allowed, that public worſhip is of particular and national advantage. To favour and practice virtue is therefore to increaſe the public happineſs, and to anſwer the intention of gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment: and by theſe means their own importance and authority will be increaſed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. WHEN the people are ſubmiſſive to their laws and rulers, upon the principles already mentioned, their Liberties will be permanent. Where the true ſpirit of religion is united to the free and generous ſpirit of Liberty, obedience will be a pleaſing duty.
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:023358_0022_0FBF3DA8751A6028"/>
The author of our benevolent religion hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to <hi>render unto Coeſar the things which are Coeſar's; and unto God, the things that are God's.</hi> The apoſtles alſo ſay, <hi>Submit yourſelves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's ſake. Render to all, their dues: trib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ute, to whom tribute is due; cuſtom, to whom cuſtom; fear, to whom fear; honour, to whom honour.</hi> Men who are under the influence of reaſon and religion, will not blame the neceſſary meaſures of government. They will not be factious and turbulent, but of a reaſonable and complying diſpoſition. They will be influenced by ſuch generous ſentiments as the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>Look not every man on his own things, but every man alſo on the things of others.</hi> We muſt endeavour to render ourſelves extenſively uſeful, and promote the good of our country; in which, not only our own happineſs, but the happineſs of millions, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>
            <p n="5">5. THE Liberties of a people cannot be laſting without knowledge. The human mind is capable of great cultivation. Knowledge is not only uſeful, but it adds dignity to man. When the minds of men are improved, they can better underſtand their rights—they can know what part they are to act, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to the welfare of the nation. Freemen ſhould always acquire knowledge; this is a privilege and pleaſure unknown to ſlaves; this elevates the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:023358_0023_0FBF3DAB57600A10"/>
mind of; man; this creates a conſcious dignity of his importance as a rational creature, and a free agent. The happineſs of mankind has been much advanced by the arts and ſciences; and they have flouriſhed the moſt among freemen. Slavery blots the image of the Creator, which was at firſt impreſſed upon man: it baniſhes knowledge, and courts miſery. But men, enlightened, purſue with ardour the knowledge and recovery of their rights. Liberty is enlightened by knowledge; and knowledge is nurtured by Liberty. Where there is wiſdom, virtue, and Liberty, there mankind are MEN—In all the dark ages of the world, tyranny has been eſtabliſhed upon the ſlaviſh igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of mankind. Tyrants, in time paſt, ſecured their domination by darkening the minds of their ſubjects. In the preſent day, they tremble at the approaching light of knowledge and Liberty. They turn indignant from the glorious illuminations of America and France. They hear with horrour the ſound of Freedom and the rights of men. They would ſtill imbrute the human race, and make man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind forget that they are men:—Be aſſured, my dear countrymen, knowledge is abſolutely neceſſary to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the bleſſings of Freedom. If you wiſh to ſee your country not only free in your day, but alſo to feaſt your imaginations with the pleaſing proſpect of a free poſterity for many ages to come; let me en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:023358_0024_0FBF3DAC483FA9F0"/>
treat you, to encourage and promote that knowledge which will enable the people ſucceſsfully to watch all the enemies of Liberty, and guard againſt the deſigns of intriguing men. Unleſs the people have knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge, they may be impoſed upon by men who are always lying in wait to diſturb the peace of ſociety, create diſorder and confuſion, and, in the tumult, overturn the Liberties of the country. Be always awake to your own intereſt, and you will have noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to fear: but if you ſleep, the enemies of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will awake:—ſleep, and by your death-like ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers you will give them life: for Liberty has never yet appeared upon the face of the earth without meeting enemies to contend with.—There have been men in America, who have reprobated what they were pleaſed to call the inquiſitive ſaucineſs of the people, when they wiſhed to know how the public affairs of the country were conducted, and how Juſtice and Liberty might be ſecured. Nay, ſome men, ſtill more unjuſt and tyrannical, have ventured to ſay—bluſh! ye degenerate ſons of free parents!—that the people, when in the poſſeſſion of Liberty, are unable to uſe it for their own advantage, and therefore they ought to be governed againſt their wills, and without their choice, by men, to be ſure, much wiſer than themſelves, and more diſpoſed to do them good. This is as much as to ſay, that the people ought to be
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:023358_0025_0FBF3DB028B25D90"/>
robbed of their natural rights for their own advantage and happineſs. But whoever is acquainted with the hiſtory of deſpotic power, need not be informed, that a free people will always uſe their Freedom more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently with the principles of juſtice and reaſon, than any men with uncontrouled power. It is a truth, and it is now too late to deny it, that no man, or body of men, are ſit to be entruſted with unlimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted power. This power they would moſt certainly abuſe, whenever their unjuſt wills were in the leaſt oppoſed. Let the youth be well educated in wiſdom and virtue; let them be inſtructed in the true princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Freedom, and they will improve their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty moſt agreeably to the rational happineſs of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. In this free country, knowledge is peculiarly neceſſary, where no other qualifications are requiſite, for the moſt important offices of government, but virtue and ability. I again ſay, let the children and youth be well educated. In the earlieſt ſtages of life, let a free and public ſpirit be infuſed into the youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful mind. This is the way to exclude from their young breaſts all oppreſſing and cruel paſſions.—Unleſs the doors of education are open to all the youth of the country equally, advantages may be taken by ſome men of cunning, to tyrannize over the reſt, and become maſters of their property. Ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery parent, and every friend to the Freedom of his
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:023358_0026_0FBF3DB5F055B7E0"/>
country, ought to be ſolicitous for the improvement of our youth in the principles of Freedom and good government, and then the people will <hi>ſtand faſt</hi> in their Liberty for a long time; yes, as long as ſuch principles are in their true exerciſe; and, with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the divine will, as long as they pleaſe.—But what! ¿Shall I doubt the attention and exertions of my fellow-citizens to this all-important cauſe of public proſperity? ¿Shall the children and youth of a free people be ſuffered to grow up ignorant of the value of thoſe Liberties you intend to commit to their truſt? ¿Shall they be unfit to take care of thoſe political bleſſings which have been ſecured for them at the great expenſe of much toil, treaſure, and precious blood? Oh! Liberty, thou friend to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, forbid it; juſtice, thou guardian of the rights of men, forbid it; ye patriots and fathers of your country, forbid it: but rather let me ſay, Oh! thou bleſſed God, who takeſt no pleaſure in the miſery of thy children, forbid it, for the ſake of him who <hi>hath made us free.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. THE principles and practice of our peaceable and benevolent religion, are the foundation on which all the bleſſings of life and Liberty muſt <hi>ſtand faſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Righteouſneſs exalteth a nation.</hi> True religion will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline a people to love and honour the MOST HIGH who <hi>ruleth among the children of men.</hi>

The influence and importance of religion ſhould be felt by men both in their family and national connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Without it, they can neither be happy in this world nor in a future ſtate.—May the benevolent ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of all public teachers of true religion, be unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the affectionate influence of parents, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the perſonal and national welfare of our country. By inſtilling good ſentiments into the tender minds of children and youth, you will teach them to <hi>ſtand faſt</hi> in their Liberty. Good impreſſions, made in early life, are very frequently of laſting benefit both to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals and the public. <hi>Train up a child in the way he ſhould go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.</hi> But, in addition to all your pious exertions, let me entreat you, never to forget to beſeech the Father of mercies and the God of all grace, to implant in the hearts of our youth, by the divine Spirit, the true principles of holineſs.</p>
            <p>I HOPE it has been evident, that, in the whole body of this diſcourſe, I have endeavoured to interweave ſentiments of religion and virtue. I cannot, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſuppoſe it neceſſary at preſent, to proſecute this

particular article any farther. Permit me, however, to aſſure you, that I have not ventured nor wiſhed to recommend Liberty without Virtue; for this would have been a recommendation of <hi>licentiouſneſs.</hi> True Liberty may be ſummed up in this declaration: that we have a right to do all the good we can; but have no right to injure our fellow-men: we have a right to be as happy as we can; but no right to leſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the happineſs of mankind.</p>

            <p>FATHERS, brethren, and fellow-citizens, with the happy feelings of a brother freeman, I congratulate you on the enjoyment of that Liberty which I have been deſcribing: it involves in it every thing moſt conducive to your peace and proſperity on earth:—claſp it to your boſoms, and religiouſly ſwear, that you will live freemen, or die bravely. I rejoice, that it is in your power, under God, to <hi>ſtand faſt</hi> in your Liberty.—¿Shall I contraſt your preſent ſituation with the deplorable ſtate of man in ages paſt? ¿Would not this draw a cloud of grief over the bright ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine of your happy feelings? We rejoice, that the earth hath been delivered from the hands of thoſe

inhuman butchers, whoſe unrelenting murders have filled ſo many bloody pages of hiſtory; who ſlaught<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered millions of the human race, for no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe but to extend their cruel and ambitious power, and oppreſs and lay waſte the world. Tyrants, who, inſtead of being tranſmitted down to us with illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous names, for being the moſt ſucceſsful deſtroyers of their fellow creatures, ſhould be named after the moſt furious beaſts of prey; and, on account of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief they have done to mankind, be claſſed with tempeſts, earthquakes, and plagues. We rejoice, with thankful hearts, that we are not under the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ſuch plagues of the human race, who wage war with the peace and happineſs of mankind; who think it an act of heroiſm to depopulate whole countries to gratify private revenge. We now ſee that the patriotic reſolutions of our countrymen have not been in vain: we now ſee that the treaſures ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in the defence of Liberty, have realized a national intereſt of more value than ten thouſand percent: we now ſee that the inexpreſſible trials and ſufferings of a patriot army, have been productive of the richeſt fruits; and that the blood of our heroes has been the ſeed of Liberty.—But, we commiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the deplorable condition of many of our fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who now groan under the heavy chains of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm: we wiſh the rights of men may be ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to them.—</p>

BUT I return from this digreſſion. I find political happineſs not abroad, but at home. Happy age and country in which we live! We remember no aera ſince the creation of the world, ſo favourable to the rights of mankind as the preſent. The hiſtories of mankind, with only a few exceptions, are the records of human guilt, oppreſſion, and miſery. Although ſome ſhadow of rude Liberty was contended for by a few ſmall uncivilized tribes of men, yet they were ſubjected by thoſe nations who were more powerful. At the beginning of the Chriſtian aera, almoſt two thirds of mankind were in the moſt abject and cruel ſlavery. The Grecian and Roman nations, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their boaſted love of Liberty, were not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the true principles of original, equal, and ſentimental Liberty. Though an imperfect civ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilization had made ſome progreſs among them, yet they neither underſtood the nature, nor practiſed the duties, of humanity. They who are acquainted with the true hiſtory of Greece and Rome, need not be informed, that the cruelty they exerciſed upon their ſlaves, and thoſe taken in war, is almoſt beyond the power of credibility. The proud and ſelfiſh paſſions have always endeavoured to ſuppreſs the ſpirit of Freedom. Even Rome herſelf, while ſhe pretended to glory in being free, endeavoured to ſubject and enſlave the reſt of mankind.—But no longer ſhall

we look to antient hiſtories for principles and ſyſtems of pure Freedom. The cloſe of the eighteenth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, in which we live, ſhall teach mankind to be truly free. The Freedom of America and France, ſhall make this age memorable. From this time forth, men ſhall be taught, that true greatneſs conſiſts not in deſtroying, but in ſaving, the lives of men; not in conquering, but making them free; not in making war, but making peace; not in making men ignorant, but making them wiſe; not in fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ing them with brutal rage, but in making them humane; not in being ambitious, but in being good, juſt, and virtuous. Of France, it may be ſaid, in the language of Scripture, <hi>¿Who hath heard ſuch a thing? ¿Who hath ſeen ſuch things? ¿Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? Or, ¿Shall a nation be born at once?</hi> Behold a nation of freemen, riſing out of a nation of ſlaves! This gratifies the feelings of humanity and benevolence. We wiſh to ſee all men independent of all things but the laws of God, and the juſt laws of their country. And will any man blame me for ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that, in America, every friend to juſtice and the rights of men wiſhes proſperity to that generous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who are allied to theſe United States, and who ſo powerfully aided them in ſecuring their independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and peace. In the name of the Lord of hoſts, let us pray, that <hi>no weapon that is formed againſt</hi> their Freedom, <hi>ſhall proſper.</hi>

I ONCE more invite you to join me in gratitude to that beſt of Beings, by whoſe providential goodneſs and power <hi>the lines are fallen unto us in pleaſant places; yea,</hi> we <hi>have a goodly heritage.</hi> Here harveſts grow for the free and cheerful huſbandman: here, neither awed by lordly and rapacious injuſtice, nor dejected by beholding idleneſs high fed and fattened on the labours of other men, they reap and enjoy the pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fruits of their honeſt induſtry. <hi>Ye ſhall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land of ſafety.</hi> Here the people dwell together as brethren; peace, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, induſtry, and health, unite their various gifts to make this life a bleſſing: here poor human nature, in other parts of the world long depreſſed by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and enſlaving power, ſeems to reclaim the primitive bleſſings of creation, and to rejoice that it was made <hi>in the image of</hi> GOD: here conſcience aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes her firſt authority; religion is no longer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved to the wills and laws of men; public and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate happineſs are guarded by the laws and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the people.—<hi>Stand faſt, therefore, in the Lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty wherewith Chriſt hath made us free, and be not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled again with the yoke of bondage.</hi> Let us determine to be free from the unjuſt power of men, and free from the ſlavery and tyranny of ſin, and we ſhall then be truly free. <hi>If the Son, therefore, ſhall make you free, ye ſhall be free indeed.</hi>

WITH the words of a celebrated French writer, this diſcourſe will be concluded.</p>
            <p>"YE people of Northamerica, let the example of all nations who have gone before you, and above all that of Greatbritain, ſerve you for inſtruction. Fear the affluence of gold, which brings with luxury the corruption of manners, the contempt of laws. Fear a too unequal diſtribution of riches, which exhibits a ſmall number of citizens in opulence, and a great multitude of citizens in extreme poverty; whence ſprings the inſolence of the former, and the debaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the latter. Secure yourſelves againſt the ſpirit of conqueſt. The tranquillity of an empire dimin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhes in proportion to its extenſion. Have arms for your defence; have none for offence. Seek compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency and health in labour; proſperity in the culture of lands, and the workſhops of induſtry; power in manners and virtue. Cauſe arts and ſciences, which diſtinguiſh the civilized from a ſavage man, to flouriſh and abound. Above all, watch carefully over the education of your children. It is from public ſchools, be aſſured, that come the wiſe magiſtrates, the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and courageous ſoldiers, the good fathers, the good huſbands, the good brothers, the good friends, the good men. Wherever the youth are ſeen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, the nation is on the decline. Let Liberty have an immoveable foundation in the wiſdom of
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:023358_0035_0FBF3DD56FFE9B18"/>
your laws, and let it be the indeſtructible cement to bind your States together. Eſtabliſh no legal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference amongſt the different forms of worſhip. Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition is innocent, wherever it is neither perſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nor protected; and may your duration, if it be poſſible, equal the duration of the world!</p>
