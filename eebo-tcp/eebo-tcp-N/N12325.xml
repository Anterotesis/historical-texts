            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <bibl>REVELATIONS iii, 22.</bibl>
               <q>He that hath an ear, let him bear what the Spirit ſaith unto the Churches.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS book is the revelation, which God gave unto his Son, and which he ſent and ſignified by his angel unto his ſervant John, in the iſland of Patmos, to which, for the word of God and the teſtimony of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, he was baniſhed by Domitian, which is ſuppoſed to have been about the year 96.</p>
            <p>This book contains a wounderful viſion that St. John had, which opened to him while he was in the ſpirit on the Lord's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ay: It opened with a great voice, as of a trumpet, and with a moſt magnificient appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of our bleſſed Lord, holding ſeven ſtars in his right hand, and walking in the midſt of ſeven golden candleſticks, which being too much for mortal eye to endure, John fell at his feet as dead; but our Lord recovered him, and bid him write the things that he revealed.</p>
            <p>And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> we have ſeven meſſengers to the ſeven Churches in Aſia.</p>
            <p>Theſe epiſtles agree much in their general form, but in the matter of addreſs vary according as the ſtate of the churches varied, to whom they were inſcribed; and yet often what was ſaid to one church agreed to others.</p>
            <p>In each epiſtle he, who walks amidſt the golden candleſticks, aſſures the churches that he knows their works. Our Lord commends every church except that of the Laodiceans, for ſomething he found good among them; and reproved every church, except that in Philadelphia, for what he found had among them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:015555_0003_0F99876307A8C508"/>
By the moſt awful threatenings he warns the remiſs; and by the moſt glorious promiſes he encourages the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. The wonderful titles of our Lord, in theſe epiſtles ſeem to agree to the particular ſtate of the churches to which they were ſent. Each epiſtle was directed to the angel of the church, that is, to the miniſter, who ſeems to be conſidered as a repreſetative of the whole church; and yet ſome things in theſe epiſtles might be peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applicable to the miniſter himſelf. In the cloſe of each epiſtle we have the ſolemn injunction in our text: He that hath an ear, let him hear what the ſpirit faith unto the churches.</p>
            <p>That is, let him hear with all attention; God plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ear for this purpoſe and he that does not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it in this manner will ſoon wiſh that he never had an ear. Let him hear what the glorious Immanual, the prince of life ſaith; this is he which liveth and was dead and is alive forever more, and hath the keys of hell and death; this is alſo he which hath the ſharp ſword with two edges; let him hear what he ſaith; his voice is as the ſound of many waters; let him hear what he faith in his providences—what he faith by his ſpirit in his word, and let him hear what he faith in theſe epiſtles to the ſeven churches in Aſia; let him hear with the ear, underſtand with the heart, and make religion the life of his ſoul. But as the contents of theſe epiſtles are of general concernment to all churches to the end of the world; let him, let her, let every one that hath an ear hear what the ſpirit faith to the churches in the preſent day; what he faith by way of commendation, by way of reproof, by way of counſel, by way of threatening, and by way of encouragement to the faithful.</p>
            <p>I. By way of commendation.</p>
            <p>Are there any miniſters, churches or private chriſtians that have borne, that have patience, and for Chriſt's name ſake, have laboured and have not fainted; who cannot bear them which are evil, who have tried them which ſay they are apoſtles and are not, and who hate the corrupt deeds of the Nicholaitans, and the doctrines
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:015555_0004_0F998763A18C5548"/>
Balaam; to you he faith, I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience,</p>
            <p>Are there any endowed with true poverty of ſpirit, and it may be poor in this world's goods, to you he faith, but thou art rich. Are there thoſe who have followed Chriſt, where Chriſt and the world have part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo have not denied his name; to you he faith, becauſe thou haſt kept the word of my truth, I alſo will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which ſhall come upon all the world, to try them which dwell upon the earth.</p>
            <p>II. Let us hear what the ſpirit faith to the churches in this land, by way of reproof and counſel.</p>
            <p>If we conſider our awful declenſions in religion; if we conſider the righteous frowns of heaven upon us, we ſhall apprehend that we hear our Lord ſpeaking to us as he did to the church of Epheſus; I have ſomewhat againſt thee, becauſe thou haſt left thy firſt love; remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent, and do the firſt works. Let all declining chriſtians look back and ſee the abatement of their former love and zeal for the glorious Immanuel; let them compare their preſent ſtate with the former, and ſay how much more comfortable it was with them then than now; let them inwardly grieve and mourn before God, and go back ſtep by ſtep, till they have gained the ground they have loſt, and do the firſt works again. Let them watch and pray and ſtrive to keep their heart with all diligence, as much as they did before.</p>
            <p>Let many proteſtant churches remember from whence they have fallen within a century paſt; for the proof of this compare the ſpirit of their latter and former writings. Let particular churches in this land remember their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenſions ſince they were firſt planted, and even within thirty years paſt, when the unclean ſpirit ſeemed, for a ſeaſon, to be going out of the land; but now he hath taken to himſelf ſeven ſpirits more wicked than the firſt, who enter in and dwell among us. Yea, let us look back to the churches in the apoſtles days, conſider
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:015555_0005_0F99876423A11FD0"/>
their love, zeal and purity, and comparing our preſent ſtate with theirs, let us remember how grievouſly we have fallen, and repent and do the firſt works. Then were fewer Hypocrites in the churches; profeſſors had reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion at heart; Chriſt dwelt among them, and additions were made to them daily of ſuch as ſhould be ſaved. Then how holy! How humble! How meek! How patient! How prayerful! How heavenly minded were chriſtians! But alas, even in John's time, many began to decline, as appears by our Lord's rebukes in theſe ſeven epiſtles. And though there have been ſeveral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivals in the church ſince, yet alas, how have we fallen from the premitive purity! How cold is our love to Chriſt and to ſouls! How dull our devotions! How languid our zeal! What pride, malice and hypocriſy prevail among us! While many have been careful to tithe mint, aniſe and cummin, we have omitted weighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er matters. How is the gold become dim, and the moſt fine gold is changed!</p>
            <p>For theſe things, for our woeful and amazing ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the ſon of God the glorions Immanual is grieved, and hath of late in an awful degree withdrawn his holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit from us, as appears—from the general decay of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly zeal in miniſters and churches—from the awful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement of ſpiritual life and power in the holy ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances—and from the growing prevalency of all kinds of ſin and iniquity, even under the tremendous frowns of Jehovah.</p>
            <p>O let us remember Jeruſalem; what diſtreſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation came upon them for grieving away the infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glorious Immanual! What ſword! What ſickneſs! What famine raged among them, till they were almoſt extirpated from the earth!</p>
            <p>And verily we have had ſome of the ſame ſigns that preceeded their deſtruction. They had calls, but deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed them; ſo have we. They were corrected, but hardened under the rod; ſo are we. They bit and devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one another, making the ſheckel great and the ephah ſmall; and inſtead of ſelling that which was good, they
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:015555_0006_0F998764E28B46E8"/>
ſold the refuſe of their wheat; their commodities were corrupt and adulterated;—added to theſe, they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned God's Heralds.</p>
            <p>They had alſo, as Joſephus relates, ſigns in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, ſtrange appearances, and particularly a "comet that hung over Jeruſalem, for a year together, in the form of a ſword." And we, for more than fifty years paſt, have been often warned by prodigies in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, particularly that called the <hi>aurora borealis,</hi> or a light in the north, which has ſometimes appeared exceeding awful, like ſtreaks of blood and fire, ſtreaming from the hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon almoſt or quite to the zenith: And after what philoſophers ſay concerning the natural cauſe, it ſtill remains a prodigy to all; and is commonly ſaid to be the fore-runner of a ſtorm. We are ſtill hardened, nor can it be expected that any prodigies will reform us, while we hear not Moſes and the prophets. And if our ſins bring on us diſtreſs ſimilar to that on the Jews, then no marvel that we ſee the ſame ſigns preceeding it.</p>
            <p>But before the decree be gone forth; before the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Lord, to make his final departure, go up from the midſt of us, let us repent and earneſtly beſeech Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manual to return and dwell among us. Then ſhould we ſee happy days again, as we have ſeen before.</p>
            <p>III. Let us hear what the ſpirit faith to the churches in this land, by way of threatning.</p>
            <p>He, who is the Amen, the faithful and true witneſs, the beginning of the creation of God, whoſe eyes are as a flame of fire, and his feet like unto fine braſs as if they did burn in a furnace, whoſe voice is as the ſound of many waters, and out of whoſe mouth proceedeth a ſharp two edged ſword; he ſpeaks to the church in this land, in accents louder than thunder; he ſays, repent, or I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candleſtick out of his place. That is, I will unchurch you, ye ſhall have no miniſters nor ordinances, and the places of worſhip ye reſorted to, ſhall enjoy their ſilent ſabbaths; and this he threatens to do quickly.</p>
            <p>Again he ſays, repent, or elſe I will come unto thee
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:015555_0007_0F99876643029970"/>
quickly, and will fight againſt them with the ſword of my mouth; that is I will pronounce terrible woes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, and will execute all the threatenings in my word upon thee, except thou repent.</p>
            <p>Again he ſays, becauſe thou art luke warm, and art neither cold nor hot, I will ſpew thee out of my mouth. Now remember theſe Aſian churches: They, and many others, have long ſince felt the frowns of the Lamb. But perhaps ſome will be ready to ſay, ah! Immanuel is bent on our ruin; he would deſtroy us of choice. But no, judgment is his ſtrange work; he doth not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict willingly, nor grieve the children of men; he hath ſworn by an oath, as I live faith the Lord God, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live. And as he ſaid to the church in Laodicea, he ſays to his corrupt church in this land. As many as I love I rebuke and chaſten<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be zealous therefore and repeat.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding we have moſt ſhamefully left our firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; notwithſtanding the blaſphemy of ſome, the corruption of many, the luke warmneſs of moſt, yet he, the glorious Immanuel, is now drawing near and waiting for our return.</p>
            <p>He ſays, behold I ſtand at the door and knock; If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him, and will ſup with him, and he with me. O how gentle! How w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ing! How condeſcending! How a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing this! Verily he muſt be deafer than a ſtone, and his heart harder than adement, who is not moved with it. Again and for encouragement, he faith, to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midſt of the paradiſe of God. That is, they ſhall partake of the full joy of heaven above; and as the tree of life is in Eden would have been to Adam a ſacrament of confirmation, in caſe he had ſtood till the end of his trial, ſo they, in the more glorious paradiſe above, ſhall forever enjoy the ſureſt pledges of their confirmation in eternal bliſs.</p>
            <p>Nor let any ſay, becauſe we are out of the church,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:015555_0008_0F998766A099B400"/>
the ſpirit faith nothing to us. Whether you are in the church or out of it, if you are ungodly there is a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for you in the ſacred word.</p>

If you aſk the import of theſe words, which I fear ſome have as little idea of as a blind man of colours, I anſwer, eternity can give their awful import!

                  <p>In the time of the Apoſtles a chriſtian church conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the people, their leaders and deacons; and every church had authority to govern itſelf according to the word of God, and was ſubject, as a church, to the controul of no power under Chriſt. Hence St. Paul bids the church of Corinth to put away from among themſelves that wicked perſon. See 1 Cor. v. 13.</p>
                  <p>They had the power of excommunication in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and it ſeems that even the apoſtles did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in matters of importance without the conſent of the brotherhood, as in Acts. xv. 22—3. Then pleaſed

it the Apoſtles and Elders, with the whole church, to ſend choſen men of their own company to Antioch. See alſo Acts i. 15 to the end—and Acts vi. 3. And while love like the ſpirit in the living creatures animated the Apoſtles, Elders and Brethren, they each went ſtraight forward. Then they were ſtrong; nor did they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend any need of leaning upon others.</p>
                  <p>But ſome time after their love and zeal were abated, all authority was reſigned to the eccleſiaſticks, and the Pope tyran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eadful ſway; and now the Church groaned under bondage in Babylon for ſeveral ages. Thus, what the Lord Chriſt gave to his chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, to uſe for their peace and edification, they tamely reſigned, and the Pope proudly aſſumed. But the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation led the Church partly out of this bondage: The Proteſtants have recovered this power out of the hands of the Pope. The Epiſcopalians lodged it in the hands of Biſhops: But the Preſbyterians went further; they retrieved the power out of the hands of the Pope and lodged it in the hands of the Clergy and a number of Elders choſen out of the Brotherhood to aſſiſt in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning. In this ſtage of the Reformation they did much better than in the former.</p>
                  <p>But after this, the Diſſenters in England retrieved the authority from the Biſhops ſolely, and acknowledged it to be in the hands of the church officers, and of every private brother, and that none under Chriſt ſhould controul them.</p>
                  <p>Thus, after long antichriſtian tyranny, the power came home again to the church, and was lodged nearer where Chriſt left it than it had been for many ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. This Authority went out in the decreaſe of love, and in the increaſe of love it returned.</p>
                  <p>But, O New-England churches! you have gone backward and not forward; you have abated of your love, zeal and fervency in religion, and inſtead of lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Lord Chriſt, as once, calling no man fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon earth, you truſt in an arm of fleſh. Inſtead of going to God for light and ſtrength to judge and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine

your own matters, we go to councils, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Chriſt, his cauſe, or his people into their hands. This privilege, the Church's power, is not to be ſold as Eſau ſold his birthright.</p>
                  <p>Our pious forefathers contended warmly for it in Old England;—the Lord Chriſt gave it them, and ſent them over to this land that they might enjoy it without moleſtation; and now will you bury the talent which you once prayed ſo earneſtly you might poſſeſs, will you bury it in the hands of councils, and then ſay to the Lord, Lo, there thou haſt that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>O New-England Churches, your crime in going back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, after ſuch marvellous deliverances, is much greater than if you had never come thus far. Iſrael were about <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Now, repent and turn again ſpeedily to the Lord; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn in the way of love, faith, and a holy zeal—and then light, courage and ſtrength will return to you. Then you will have leſs inclination to commit this ſacred right to councils, and they will leſs deſire it; and I believe that ſuch a reformation is as laudable as it was for the Jews to return from Babylon to rebuild Jeruſalem. This would embolden you to look to God for that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection in an approaching ſtorm which he afforded to our forefathers. Would you enjoy their bleſſing, then prove yourſelves their children by following them as they followed Chriſt and his primitive churches.</p>

                  <p>And you who are ſo wiſe as to keep the word of Chriſt's patience, he will keep from the hour of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which will come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth. Revel. iii. 10. Now I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that they who conduct neareſt to the above line beſt deſerve the name of chriſtians of any in New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. And neither would I profeſs to be Preſbyterian, or a Congregationaliſt or any other name, but by the grace of God to be a Chriſtian.
