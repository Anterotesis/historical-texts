            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p>A GREAT fundamental principle of action, applying to national intercourſe and tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of every kind, whether commercial or not, is, that one nation ſhould not injure another: that national conduct ſhould, upon all occaſions, be frank and ſincere; or that whatever might be the relative power, there ſhould be no aim to over-reach, or to obtain unequal or improper advantages. The writers upon the law of nations agree in this great principle, as ſpringing from the law of nature. From whence they infer, that treaties made, and to be kept, ſhould have equality for their baſis, let what may be the ſtate and condition of the contracting parties; for as ſuperiority of power creates no obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, or right, "ſo power or weakneſs," ſays Vat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, "does not, in this reſpect, produce any differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence." <note n="*" place="bottom">Vattel, book 1. chap. 1. page 18.</note> Equal treaties then, founded on equal rights, and conferring equal benefits, are alone obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory by the law of nations. "Treaties equal," ſays Vattel, "are thoſe in which the contracting par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties promiſe the ſame things, or things that are equiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alent;
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:031857_0005_0FEF21A094FC5C38"/>
or, in ſhort, that are equitably proportioned, ſo that their condition is equal. Equal treaties may be ſubdivided into as many kinds as the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns have different tranſactions between them. Thus they treat of the conditions of commerce,"<note n="*" place="bottom">Vattel, book 2. chap. 12. ſect. 172.</note> &amp;c. "Nations not being leſs obliged than individuals, to have regard for equity, they ought, as much as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to preſerve equality in their treaties; when, therefore, the parties are in ſuch a ſtate, as to obtain the <hi>ſame reciprocal advantages,</hi> the law of nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires their treaties ſhould be equal, at leaſt, if there is not ſome particular reaſon to deviate from that equality, ſuch as gratitude for a former benefit,"<note n="†" place="bottom">Vattel, book 11. chap. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> &amp;c. Unequal treaties, ſays the ſame author, are thoſe in which the allies do not promiſe the ſame things, and where the conditions of commerce, or whatever may the objects of the treaty, are unequal.</p>
            <p>To apply the foregoing obſervations, drawn from the law of nations, to a particular article of the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh treaty, to determine its meaning and conſtruction, it may not be improper, in the firſt place, to recite the 14th article of the treaty at large, and then to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, whether there is not ſufficient latitude, in its conſtruction, to juſtify ſuch additional regulations of commerce, as ſhall give that protection and ſupport to the commerce and navigation of the United States, which reciprocity demands.</p>

            <p>If the ſtipulation of a reciprocal and perfect liberty of commerce and navigation herein made, as well as the protection and ſecurity promiſed to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and traders on each ſide, is not ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit, when it is declared, as to what reſpects the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, to be always ſubject to the laws and ſtatutes of the two countries reſpectively; ſhould it be made a queſtion, whether a general ſtipulation, under as gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral an exception, as to the laws and ſtatutes of the two countries, ſhall be conſtrued to preclude the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature from making laws and ſtatutes, which are neceſſary to procure the reciprocity guarantied, or ſuch laws and ſtatutes as are founded in reciprocity and equality; and in the policy and practice of one of the contracting parties, the Britiſh? or whether it ought to be ſuppoſed, that the other contracting party (the United States) ſhould be tied down under the general ſtipulation, and not allowed to protect its citizens and commerce againſt foreign interference? or whether a perfect liberty of commerce and naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ought to be granted on one ſide, againſt a very imperfect one on the other? or, in other words, whether the affected perfect liberty conferred by the treaty, marred by reſtrictions and prohibitions, ought to reciprocate few, or no advantages on the one hand, whilſt the moſt perfect liberty, common to every cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izen of the United States, is allowed on the other, with the exception of an extra tonnage duty upon foreign veſſels, and an addition of one tenth to the amount of the impoſt accruing upon their cargoes?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:031857_0007_0FEE935263F45498"/>If ſuch a conſtruction is admitted, there is no room left on which legiſlation can exerciſe its powers; all future laws and ſtatutes of the two countries being neceſſarily contravened. And although Britiſh mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and traders might introduce practices injurious to the rights and intereſts of the merchants and citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of the United States, they would not be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to laws made poſterior to the treaty; and of courſe there might be a ſet of foreigners, under the privileges of a general protection, committing inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to the commerce of the country beyond the reach of legiſlative remedy.</p>
            <p>If this conſtruction was the one deſigned, why was the exception made as to the laws and ſtatutes of the two countries? Was it to ratify and confirm Britiſh navigation acts, and the reſtrictions and prohibitions of Britiſh ſtatutes on the one ſide, and to leave no means to reciprocate ſuch diſadvantages on the other?</p>
            <p>If this was intended, why was it not declared; and that no future laws or ſtatutes ſhould be made to limit or reſtrain the liberty therein given; in which caſe, with what view, or to what purpoſe, was the ſucceeding, the 15th article, made?</p>
            <p>The 15th article appears to be but an exception or a proviſo to the 14th; or if it is not, it has neither meaning nor ſignification: For if the legiſlative power was to be controled, in future, by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of the preceding article, of what conſequence was it to ſtipulate, that "no other or higher duties <hi>ſhall</hi> be paid by the ſhips and merchandizes of the one party, in the ports of the other, than ſuch as are paid, by the like veſſels, on merchandize of all other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions"? or that "no other, or higher duty, ſhould be impoſed in one country, on the importation of any articles of the growth, produce or manufacture of the other, than are, or <hi>ſhall be payable</hi> (mark this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion) on the importation of the like articles, being of the growth, produce or manufacture of any other foreign nation"? Or of what import are the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:031857_0008_0FEF21AA70C95588"/>
words? <q>Nor <hi>ſhall</hi> any prohibition be impoſed on the exportation or importation of any article, to or from the territories of the two parties reſpectively, which <hi>ſhall</hi> not equally extend to all other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</q> The reply is, that the 15th article muſt become nugatory, and be without meaning or ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, if the unnatural conſtruction aforementioned is admitted. The ſtipulation of the 14th article ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to guaranty a reciprocal liberty of commerce, and navigation, with protection and ſecurity to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and traders; but ſubject to the laws and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of the two countries reſpectively; provided ſuch laws and ſtatutes ſhall conform to the proviſions and limitations of the 15th article. Taking the two articles together, the conſtructions harmonize, and the legiſlatures of the two countries are left only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the reſtraints of reciprocity, as to commerce and navigation; that in caſe either party ſhould think it neceſſary to reciprocate what it ſhould deem unequal, or diſadvantageous, the regulations neceſſary therefor muſt extend to every other nation. This conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion gives to the treaty its true meaning, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms to the law of nations, which exacts juſtice and equality, as the baſis of commercial and political tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions. It is preſumed then, that the United States have a clear, obvious right to paſs ſuch laws and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes as are neceſſary to equalize commercial advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, and to give protection and ſecurity to their cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izens againſt foreign interference.</p>
            <p>Admitting the foregoing reaſoning to be juſt, the next inquiry which ariſes out of our ſubject, is, What regulations does reciprocity require, on our part, to place the commerce of the two countries upon that footing of equality which wiſdom on the one ſide, and a liberal policy on the other, ought to demand?</p>
            <p>To permit commercial intercourſe to take off the ſurplus productions, beyond what are neceſſary for home conſumption, is a duty that nations owe to the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:031857_0009_0FEF21ADD448E6D0"/>
welfare and happineſs of each other; and the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is no leſs ſtrong, that the exchanges ſhould be founded in juſtice and equity; for the moral princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of nations does not permit unequal regulations of commerce; or, at leaſt, if they are aſſumed, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured through artifice or intrigue by the one party, it is made the duty of the other, by the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to reſiſt and to oppoſe them. In order then to examine the ſubject before us with clearneſs and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, it is neceſſary to inquire,
<list>
                  <item>1. What is the relative ſituation, in reſpect to commerce and navigation, ariſing out of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting laws and ſtatutes of the two countries re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively? And</item>
                  <item>2. To ſuggeſt what meaſures are probably neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to place their commerce and navigation upon the footing of reciprocal and mutual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>In treating the important ſubject herein undertaken, it is proper to premiſe, that what is aimed to be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed, reſts as much upon facts, as deductions; upon commercial ſtatements, as political inferences. The facts depended on, are the cuſtom-houſe ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Great-Britain, and thoſe official documents, and other references, which were thought ſufficient data, on which to ground that ſyſtem of rules and regulations, by which Great-Britain is, and has been guided in her commerce with this country. A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence to the ſame facts and authorities, which, it is conceived, are the beſt the ſubject admits, cannot be deemed unfair, to ſhew the inequality and danger of the United States from ſuch regulations, and the neceſſity of reſiſting and oppoſing them by counter regulations.</p>

            <p>With reſpect to the regulations above recited, it is to be obſerved, that they were repeated the Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber following, and have been, from time to time, ſince continued, with little alteration in their principle, by acts which have paſſed, at every ſeſſion of Parliament, authorizing his Majeſty to make them; and they are now confirmed, with the approbation of the United States, in the ratification of the late treaty with Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ain,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:031857_0012_0FEF21B8CBF94AD8"/>
viz. in the 14th article aforementioned, which ſubjects the liberty of commerce, therein given, "to the laws and ſtatutes of the two countries reſpectively." It is but juſtice to the treaty, however, to ſay, that the proviſions of the 12th article, which were refuſed ratification by the United States, were intended as a mitigation to the injuries and inequalities of theſe reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulations. The conceſſions therein made, by the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh government, although unequal to the ſacrifices, by the United States, in other parts of the treaty, might have been of ſome commercial advantage; but they were accompanied with ſuch indignities to the freedom and independence of the country, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to productions from the dominions of other ſtates, that they could not be accepted.</p>
            <p>But before I proceed to obſerve upon the detail, it will be proper to make a few obſervations upon the principle of the foregoing regulations.</p>
            <p>They hold up an important diſtinction between the European and the other dominions of Great-Britain, in the allowance of commerce with the United States. If this diſtinction was proper, why did it not go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and extend the ſame reſtriction to Ireland, which is no more than a Britiſh colony; or to Scotland or Wales, or to all of them; for there would have been equal propriety in extending the reſtrictions further, even to all the Britiſh dominions, whether in Europe or elſewhere, which, it is believed, would have been moſt for the intereſt of the United States, as to have limited the reſtrictions to the Engliſh colonies only? In ſuch caſe, the United States would have ſeen through the equity of the regulations, and governed themſelves accordingly. As well might the United States ſay, that liberty of commerce ſhould be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſubjects of Great-Britain, except with Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, South-Carolina and Georgia, and with them, ſo far as to permit the citizens of the United States to tranſport tobacco, rice, and naval ſtores to Great-Britain, if ſhipped in American bottoms, with liberty
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:031857_0013_0FEF21BA51208968"/>
to import into thoſe ſtates, in like bottoms, Engliſh manufactures, with the exception of woolen cloths, cottons, and ſome other principal Britiſh merchandiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, which ſhould be totally prohibited.</p>
            <p>Whenever a nation ſets up a principle of action, as a rule of commercial or political conduct, which is to operate upon the commerce or policy of other nations, it is becoming, that it ſhould regard juſtice and equity, in relation to ſuch nations with which ſhe has political or commercial tranſactions. It is not ſufficient for a nation to ſay, that ſhe has colonies, which, becauſe ſhe has planted, ſhe will wantonly exclude from other nations, and monopolize to herſelf their commerce and labour: nor is it ſufficient, that this principle be fortified by the uſages and practices of nations; or that Grotius, Puffendorf, Burlamaqui, and Vattel, implicitly or explicitly juſtify it. Two conſiderations, in their nature previous to the adoption of ſuch a rule, enter into its exerciſe, and ought to make its principle; the firſt is, whether it is for the beſt intereſt of the parent ſtate as connected with the leaſt injury to the inhabitants of her colonies: and the ſecond, whether it is for her beſt intereſt as connected with thoſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages ſhe derives from the commerce of other ſtates. Admitting the right of monopoly over colonies, in the moſt extenſive ſenſe that protection and power can give it, it does not follow, that the inhabitants of colonies have no claim upon the parent ſtate, from ſituation and humanity, from circumſtances and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients, in procuring their own welfare, with the objects of their eſtabliſhment: although the parent ſtate is ſovereign, and colonies ſhould be ſubordinate; and ſhould produce, ſay indefeaſible right, on the one ſide; and abſolute ſubmiſſion on the other; yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary and cruel deprivations cannot be juſtified under ſuch a claim. Their circumſtances and ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, their internal and external relations, muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a choice of means, which muſt deſignate the wiſdom, juſtice and policy of the meaſures purſued.
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:031857_0014_0FEF21BD9C443C90"/>
To ſay then, that colonies have no rights, but ſuch as are abſorbed in the mere will of the metropolitan ſtate, is abſurd: nor leſs ſo, would it be to ſay, that it would be always for the intereſt of the metropolitan ſtate to exclude foreigners from a participation in its colonial commerce; for ſuch a regulation ſhould ariſe rather from policy than right, and muſt depend upon the liquidation of advantages and diſadvantages, in its commerce with other ſtates: if the right is aſſumed, the policy may be denied, and the metropolitan ſtate may become the loſer from its aſſumption. In ſuch caſe, it had been better to have adhered to the policy, rather than the right. The concurrence, then, of both the one, and the other, muſt be brought into view, to determine the fitneſs and propriety of ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial regulations. The right then reſts preciſely upon the ſame footing, which every independent country poſſeſſes, of regulating its own commerce, to extend, to limit, or totally to prohibit it, with foreign nations, leaving the ſame right to the nation affected by ſuch regulations, which muſt, of neceſſity, at length reduce the right to a mere queſtion of policy.</p>
            <p>Let us examine then, whether right and policy concur, in the preſent caſe, to juſtify Great-Britain in excluding the citizens of the United States from a participation in the commerce and navigation of her Weſt-India iſlands, admitting the right and power of retaliation in the United States, which ſhall hereafter be ſhewn.</p>
            <p>Whenever we reflect upon what was the relative ſituation of the United States and the Engliſh Weſt-India colonies, that we were the offspring of the ſame parent, eſtabliſhed and protected by the ſame power, and nouriſhed and cheriſhed for the ſame purpoſe, viz. the aggrandizement of the Britiſh empire; without entering into the diſputes which brought on the American revolution; ſuffice it to ſay, that there was, before the revolution, a cloſe, intimate and beneficial commercial connection, which ſubſiſted between the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:031857_0015_0FEF21BF21F7D8B8"/>
Engliſh Weſt-India iſlands and the now United States. Mutual wants and conveniences were its foundation, which contributed not leſs to the growth and proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the then reſpective colonies, than to the opulence and grandeur of the mother country.</p>
            <p>To ſever and cut off a commercial intercourſe, ſpringing from ſituation, interwoven by habit, and cemented by ſo many ties of intereſt and convenience, ought to be juſtified by arguments of more ſolidity than the independence of the United States, or the mere right of monopoly over the trade and produce of colonies.</p>
            <p>It is admitted, that the citizens of the two coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, by the ſovereignty and independence of the United States, became aliens to each other, and that each country poſſeſſed, in a ſenſe, the right of limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reſtricting, or prohibiting its commerce, as it might deem beſt; yet, when a narrow, illiberal pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icy, bottomed upon reſentment and diſappointment, rather than its real intereſt, or the convenience or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of its colonies, became adopted into a ſyſtem of commercial regulations, ſuch a conduct, if proved, muſt deſerve reprobation and reproach, and in the end will produce defenſory meaſures, which ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite their injuſtice. Several of the ſtates, in the year 1784, in their individual capacities, as well as the Engliſh Weſt-India merchants and planters, made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual efforts to procure the repeal of theſe offenſive regulations. The latter, that is, the Engliſh mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and planters, petitioned the Engliſh parliament, pointing out the injurious conſequences of the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of commerce to the Weſt-India iſlands; that they were founded in ill policy and reſentment, and would induce a retaliation on the part of the United States. The ſtates of Virginia, New-York, New-Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey, and Maryland, paſſed reſolutions upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, conſidering them as aggreſſions upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of the ſtates, and ſtrongly recommending countervailing reſtrictions. The ſtate of Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:031857_0016_0FEF21C49F668B30"/>
paſſed a navigation act, with an expectation it would have been followed by ſimilar acts from the other ſtates, which was to have been in force until Congreſs ſhould have been empowered to regulate trade: but it not being ſeconded by any other ſtate than Rhode-Iſland, it was repealed, for the want of a more general concurrence. Thus ended the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of retaliation by Engliſh writers, and Weſt-India planters; and thus became fruitleſs, the individual attempts of ſeveral of the ſtates to remedy the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and cruelties of theſe pernicious regulations of commerce.</p>
            <p>Mankind don't adminiſter to the rights of others ſo much from duty as from fear; it is by retaliation, that nations muſt make their rights and intereſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, when they are infringed. The United States, untaught by experience, and not having provided againſt the evils, which awaited their independence, for ſix years were laid under Britiſh commercial bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and patiently ſuffered their navigation, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and manufactures, to be almoſt cut up by the roots, for the want of thoſe defenſory reſtrictions, which were neceſſary to their protection. Theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, ſenſibly as they were felt, had their attendant benefits; they afforded an inſtructive leſſon to the honeſt unſuſpecting politics of our country. Great-Britain, under the deceitful appearance of tendering to us the liberal hand of friendſhip and reconciliation, at the eſtabliſhment of peace, diſarmed us of our pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and, by her commercial arrangements, even put to hazard the very independence for which we had contended, and achieved. The ſeveral ſtates ſaw the evil, which was ſapping their beſt intereſts, jealous of their ſovereignties, and diſtracted by oppoſing ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, from the defect of the old organization of Congreſs; and from the neceſſity of a power to reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulate commerce, the great actuating motive for the adoption of a Federal Conſtitution, the now Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the United States became accepted, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:031857_0017_0FEF21C9DD2E69C8"/>
by the people, truſting, that its reſult would produce a conduct from Great-Britain more conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to equity, and to thoſe advantages ſhe was daily deriving from the commerce of the United States. But Engliſh miniſters, hitherto knowing the influence of language, habits, manners, faſhions, and credits; knowing the difficulties and embarraſſments attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant on the altering of old channels of commerce; knowing her power to circumſcribe her own mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, whilſt ours were open to her manufactures; knowing the prejudicies and jealouſies ſubſiſting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſeveral ſtates, ſhe has even procured a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in our own ports, through her merchants and factors, for the employment of her ſhips and veſſels, to thoſe of the United States: and the United States, for ſeveral years, exhibited a ſituation as novel as it was abſurd; foreign ſhips and veſſels finding in our ports ample and ready freights, whilſt thoſe of the United States, circumvented by Britiſh reſtrictions, were rotting at our wharves, for want of employ.</p>
            <p>It is by the ſettled tendency of meaſures, rather than by profeſſions and declarations, that we muſt judge of the friendſhip or enmity of nations: we need not recur, for inſtance, to the hiſtories of either France or England, to know their enmity and hatred to each other: a recurrence to their laws, and to their rules of commerce, will ſufficiently diſcover their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and reſentments, perhaps more ſtrongly than the hiſtory of their battles. Accident, miſtake, or occurrences, from a thouſand circumſtances, might produce temporary hoſtilities; but in the ſettled rules and regulations of their general and commercial pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icy, their hatred, their malice, and their rivalries, will be more fully deſignated: in like manner, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to the Engliſh regulations of commerce, adopted towards this country, in the face of the petitions and remonſtrances of the moſt reſpectable Engliſh merchants and Weſt-India planters, to point to their leading motives, <hi>we cannot doubt, that extreme ſelfiſhneſs,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:031857_0018_0FEF21CB7922D8A8"/>
and a marked reſentment againſt the United States general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the New-England ſtates in particular, for their manly conduct in the revolution, were the chief objects and end of their policy.</hi> Circumſtanced and ſituated as the New-England States particularly were, at the cloſe of the war, can the narrow, ſelfiſh, bigoted policy of a Britiſh miniſter be juſtified in denouncing their navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, fiſheries, and commerce, by the moſt ſudden, cruel and oppreſſive regulations? Is it poſſible, that the New-England ſtates can have witneſſed the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of ſuch meaſures, and obſerve them continued and perſiſted in, and yet be taught, as ſome amongſt us affect to inſtruct us, that an Engliſh alliance ought to be courted and preferred to all others? if alliances with reſtrictions and prohibitions ought to be court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; if they are marks of friendſhip, a New-England<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man might well aſk, what are indications of enmity, ſhort of open hoſtility? whilſt he will apoſtrophize and ſay, From ſuch friendſhip, and ſuch regulations of commerce, good Lord deliver us!</p>
            <p>But as it would be unwarrantable, and it is not my intention, to miſrepreſent, either the deſigns or the policy of the Britiſh government, it is fitting that the facts and ſtatements, on which the foregoing ſuggeſtions are grounded, ſhould be laid before the public.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The citizens of the United States and their veſſels were excluded commercial intercourſe with the Britiſh Weſt-India iſlands, whereby the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of above thirty thouſand tons of American ſhipping was totally interdicted, beſides the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of a great diminution, both in the vent of Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ican productions, and in the ſupply of thoſe of the Weſt-Indies, which aroſe from confining the carrying trade, in both directions, to Engliſh veſſels.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The following important articles of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of the United States, particularly thoſe of the New-England ſtates, were totally prohibited to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into the Engliſh Weſt-India colonies, either in
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:031857_0019_0FEF21CD08B631B0"/>
Britiſh or American bottoms, viz. beef, pork, ſalted fiſh, whale oil, ſpermaceti candles, &amp;c. whereby the New-England ſtates ſuſtained an annual loſs of vent or market for upwards of <q>fifteen thouſand barrels of beef and pork, two hundred and thirty thouſand quintals of fiſh, about five hundred tons of whale oil,</q> which, with the other articles of the growth and produce of the United States annually ſhipped to the Engliſh Weſt-Indies, amounted, by the Britiſh ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, to not leſs than a million ſterling, which not only ſupplied them with the produce of the Engliſh iſlands, viz. with <q>three million ſix hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand gallons of Weſt-India rum, three thouſand hogſheads, fifteen hundred tierces and four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand barrels of ſugar, one hundred and fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand gallons of molaſſes, with coffee to the amount of £50,000 ſterling; cocoa, mahogany plank, pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta, ginger, cotton wool, fuſtick, logwood, and lignum-vitae, to the amount of £. 60,000 ſterling, beſides a balance in caſh of £.240,000 ſterling.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Brian Edwards's pamphlet, reſpecting the trade of the Weſt-India iſlands with the United States.</note>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It was natural for the unſuſpecting politics of the United States to ſuppoſe that Great-Britain had ſo much to gain, by permitting their commerce to take its old channels, and in the end, ſo much to loſe, if they would not permit it, that the general balance of the whole trade was ſo much to the advantage of Great-Britain, by receiving an annual balance from the United States of above ſix hundred thouſand pounds ſterling, beſides the immenſe advantage ariſing from the freightage of the produce of the United States, that ſhe would not, under ſuch circumſtances, aim to proſcribe her markets to American veſſels; nor to carry into effect againſt them, her illiberal ſyſtem of reſtrictions and prohibitions upon foreigners, and foreign veſſels, to the diſadvantage of any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar part of the commerce of the United States, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the New-England ſtates: but in this, the United
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:031857_0020_0FEF21CE8F5402E0"/>
States have found themſelves deceived, and Great-Britain has hitherto been able to ſupport her narrow, ſelfiſh ſyſtem of commercial regulations, unretaliated by the United States, through her machinations and intrigues, in the government of the United States.</p>
            <p>But the neceſſity of reviſing the commercial ſyſtem of the United States does not reſt, merely, upon the Engliſh colonial arrangements, but muſt be conſidered in connection with her European ſyſtem of commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial policy; and in relation to the diſtinctions and diſabilities, which the laws of England impoſe, between foreigners and Britiſh ſubjects.</p>
            <p>Although merchant ſtrangers enjoy important priv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ileges in England, compared with thoſe of ſome other countries of Europe, except Holland; that when friends, they have a conſtitutional right of reſidence, and a legal protection to their perſons and properties, extending even to the right of holding real eſtate, when not to their own uſe, they are ſtill under nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous diſabilities, and ſubject to peculiar impoſitions, which, although leſſening, ſays Judge Blackſtone, "from the commercial intereſt and policy of the nation," yet they create important diſtinctions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween natives and foreigners, to the benefit of the one, and to the prejudice of the other. To theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, numerous as they are, ſay Britiſh miniſters, the citizens of the United States became ſubject from their independence! and what rendered them the more injurious, was, that they had been the ground, and reaſon, on which the commerce of the United States had, in many caſes, been predicated. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous example of the fact herein ſtated, well known to the people of New-England, is the alien duty of £.18-3 ſterling per ton on foreign train oil, original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intended, as it now continues to be, a prohibition upon its importation into England; whereby the employment of one hundred and thirty ſail of our veſſels, or thirteen thouſand tons of ſhipping, in our whale fiſhery, was laid under ſuch embarraſſments,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:031857_0021_0FEF21D660685360"/>
that it became nearly ruined before other channels of vent could be found <note n="*" place="bottom">To preſerve the whale fiſhery of Maſſachuſetts from total ruin, the ſtate of Maſſachuſetts, in the year 1785, was obliged to grant the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bounties upon whale oil, viz. on white ſpermaceti oil, five pounds per ton; yellow ditto, three pounds; and common whale oil, 40 ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings per ton; which were continued until the 1ſt of December, 1787: and on which were paid £. 10,293-3-10 Maſſachuſetts currency.</note>; and it has not, even at this period, arrived at its uſual ſtate of proſperity; not now employing more than forty ſhips of two hundred tons, or eight thouſand tons of ſhipping; in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which, a remittance of one hundred and fifty thouſand pounds ſterling in train oil, to pay for Britiſh manufactures, allowed <hi>free entry,</hi> was at once interdicted, and the country reduced to the neceſſity of finding therefor other means of payment.</p>
            <p>Upon the ſame principle, American built ſhips were prohibited ſale in Britiſh ports; or, what was the ſame thing, the prohibitions and reſtrictions of the Engliſh navigation act deſtroyed the Engliſh market for the ſale of American built veſſels, which, before the revolution, Great-Britain had been in the habit of purchaſing, deriving, at leaſt, two fifths of her ſhips and veſſels from the built of America, amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to about two hundred and ten thouſand tons, which, if renewed every ſeven years, the time allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by Britiſh accounts, for the duration of American built veſſels, an annual vent for thirty thouſand tons of ſhipping became loſt to the United States; which, if calculated at ſix pounds ſterling per ton, including their ſails and rigging, without reckoning their freight to England, amounted to one hundred and eighty thouſand pounds ſterling. If we add to theſe injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſtinctions, the numerous reſtraints upon aliens, who may reſide in England, for the purpoſe of carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on commerce, (the particulars of which may be ſeen by recurring to the Engliſh rate books), we ſhall find, that the privileges granted, by the 14th article of the Britiſh treaty, to the citizens of the United States, unleſs counter reſtrictions and prohibitions are

            <p>In ſhort, to enumerate the invidious diſtinctions between Engliſh ſubjects and foreigners, in relation to commercial advantages in Great-Britain, would be to tranſcribe ſome pages, at leaſt, from their Engliſh rate books; and to take up more time and attention than is neceſſary for the preſent purpoſe: ſufficient is it to ſay, that the acts and ſtatutes of the Engliſh Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament are well calculated to procure to the Engliſh merchants, the factorage upon foreign merchandizes, to exclude foreigners from participation in any of the advantages of her internal commerce, and to ſecure her markets, excluſively, to her own citizens, againſt foreign interference, by prohibiting ſuch articles of foreign growth or manufacture, which interferes with her own. It is by recurring to the principles of theſe laws, and by carrying them into practice, that the United States will be able to obtain, promote, and ſecure their own proſperity, and at the ſame time, to retaliate the diſadvantages they experience, from the ſelfiſh, commercial policy of Great-Britain.</p>
            <p>If what has been already ſuggeſted, does not fully ſtate the principles of the Engliſh regulations of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce;

if the details produced, do not corroborate thoſe principles, nor ſatisfactorily evince their injuſtice, and inequality, the annual balance of trade, in favour of Great-Britain, will give force to their tendency, and muſt convince every unprejudiced mind, that means more effectual, than thoſe already deviſed, are neceſſary to place the commerce of the two countries upon a more equal footing than the one on which it now ſtands.</p>
            <p>If there is a principle of commercial intercourſe, which can neither be controverted by argument, nor denied with reaſon; if there is a predominating maxim, diſtinguiſhed as a juſt rule of commercial tranſaction; it is, <hi>that a commerce is beneficial, or perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, in proportion to the balances paid and received by the reſpective countries carrying it on.</hi> The commercial intercourſe between England and Ruſſia, for example, has been the theme of much Engliſh Parliamentary diſcuſſion, if not of political lamentation and grief, in conſequence of the annual balance of half a million ſterling, paid in favour of Ruſſia,<note n="*" place="bottom">

interchange of the products of one country, for thoſe of another; the advantages are reciprocal, when the one receives as much of the other, as it gives of its own products in exchange; but if the exchanges are unequal, in proportion to their exceſs, they become beneficial to the one, and injurious to the other.

It appears, by the Engliſh ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of imports and exports for the year 1773, that there was paid, by the United States to Great-Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ain, a balance of £.610,184-12-5 ſterling; viz.</p>

But when we have had ſo unfavourable a balance, ſo immenſe in its amount, when applied to Great-Britain, that the demand for Britiſh manufactures, inſtead of relaxing, has acquired force, from our commercial policy: that the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, which had grown up under the reſtrictions and prohibitions of the ſeveral ſtates, had been grad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually expiring; whereby the intermediate relations between huſbandmen and merchants have almoſt wholly ſubſided: that what had been called protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duties, whether ariſing from inſufficiency in their

execution, or inadequacy in their proviſion, had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded neither ſecurity nor protection; or from what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever cauſe, a plain, obvious fact is manifeſt; <hi>that the manufactures of the United States are now reduced to a lower ſtate, than they have been at any former period.</hi> No doubt, ſome of thoſe inconveniences are to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the war in Europe; but it muſt be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, that the inconvenience, attendant on the paper ſyſtem of the United States, from the nature of it, was to reduce the value of ſpecie, by cauſing an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial repletion; the effect of which, was to raiſe the price of labour, and of the neceſſaries of life, and of courſe to diſcourage our own manufactures, by render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their competition more favourable to foreigners.</p>
            <p>The fitneſs and propriety of commercial intercourſe depends on calculation, and minute inveſtigation of advantages and diſadvantages: To ſuppoſe that an object of ſuch importance ought to reſt merely on the caſual, tranſient information of the members of a Legiſlature, would ſeem improper; or, at leaſt, it has been deemed ſo, by the Britiſh nation, as long ago as Cromwell's time, (1665), when a board of commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners of trade and plantations was eſtabliſhed; which, although afterwards laid down for a time, was revived in the year 1696, under the adminiſtration of King William. To this board, the Britiſh nation owes its principal commercial proſperity: its buſineſs has been, from time to time, to recommend altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the trade laws; to ſtate "favourable, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favourable balances of trade, with foreign nations; and to receive propoſals for the caſe and improvement of navigation, manufactures, and commerce." By the conſtitution of the board, it was to conſiſt of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, having a "<hi>thorough knowledge of the general ſtate, hiſtory, and intereſts of commerce.</hi> How far an eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment of this ſort, would be worth the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our government, is not the preſent inquiry, any further than to ſhew, that the navigation, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ufactures, and commerce of a country, and the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:031857_0029_0FEF21F2CADB76F8"/>
them in a juſt relation to each other, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign nations, are objects of the higheſt importance, demanding the attention of government, particularly in relation to the policy of ſuch nations, with which we have unfavourable balances.</p>
            <p>There are writers, among whom is Mr. Hume,<note n="*" place="bottom">See 5th eſſay, vol. 2.</note> who have ſuppoſed, that the received, if not eſtabliſhed opinions, in reſpect to balances of trade, were errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and without foundation; and that ſuch balances would find their own level: that the precious metals were no other than merchandize, which would have a value with regard to commodities, or other proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in proportion to their plenty or ſcarcity: that if money was more plenty than other property, it would be of a leſs comparative value; and that if commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or other property, were plentier than money, that it would be of a comparative greater: that if a country had accidentally loft the greater part of its circulating medium, that the remaining quantity would ſtill be a mean of transferring property, at a proportionably leſs price: and that, therefore, a nation had nothing to do, but to attend to its induſtry, and that trade would balance itſelf. However plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſolacing this theory is, and however well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it may have been, for the people and times in which it was ſuggeſted, the government of England never thought the principle worthy of their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but aims at preſerving a general balance in its favour; and conſiders every trade pernicious, which carries a balance againſt her; and the more ſo, in proportion to the increaſe of ſuch balance. Profeſſor Smith concurs, in ſome points, with Mr. Hume, in regard to balances of trade; but confeſſes, that there is a balance of <q>produce, and conſumption, which, as it happens to be either favourable or unfavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, neceſſarily occaſions the proſperity or decay of a nation;" "if the exchangeable value of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual produce," ſays this excellent writer, "falls ſhort of the annual conſumption, the capital of the
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:031857_0030_0FEF21FA44A88910"/>
ſociety muſt annually decay in proportion to this deficiency. <note n="*" place="bottom">Smith on the wealth of nations, vol. 2. chap. 3d. part 2d. page 208.</note>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But admitting Mr. Hume's poſition to be true, in an abſtract view, it does not follow, that trade ought to be left to itſelf, and to the commercial impoſitions, that other nations may put upon it; for a commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial law extends beyond the juriſdiction of the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment making it: it may go to the denying, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailing, or extending the privileges of other nations; even to the giving a preference of one nation to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. In proportion as ſuch a law limits, reſtricts, or denies commercial intercourſe to other nations, the aſſumed juriſdiction, if unretaliated, becomes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious and injurious. In this caſe, a commercial, may have the effect of a political law, operating either upon other nations generally, or to extend the power of one ſtate, whilſt it may be a mean of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing that of another: it may give advantages, with or without receiving equivalents; it may deny benefits, when more than equivalents are beſtowed, if the nation receiving the diſadvantages, will permit them: but if the reſtrictive operation of the law ſhould be retaliated, as it ought to be, the commercial inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe might diminiſh, or be ſuſpended for a time, until both parties ſhould find it convenient to make mutual conceſſions. Since, by regulating trade then, it may be ſo contrived, as to produce favourable or unfavourable balances, ſo a nation, for the moſt part, paying an unfavourable balance, may moſt commonly conclude, that in caſe of its taking place, it ariſes from unjuſt and ſelfiſh trade laws in other nations, which require, and ought to be retaliated. For one of three things muſt neceſſarily reſult from an unfavourable balance of trade, when the commodities imported are conſumed, and are not re-exported. 1. The ſpecie muſt either be exported, to pay the unfavourable bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance:—or, 2. it muſt be made up from the exceſs, in the commerce with other ſtates;—or, 3. it muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a debt againſt the country.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:031857_0031_0FEF21FBC8CFD048"/>With reſpect to the firſt, whatever may have been ſaid by Mr. Hume, that a circulating medium will regulate itſelf, and that no country need be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive from its exports, whilſt it has population, and the means of induſtry; yet every ſtate muſt feel appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive for its ſafety and welfare, from depreciating the value of property, in relation to the precious met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, when ſuch changes are known to lay the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of injuſtice, and to produce diſtruſt, diſorder, and confuſion in every country. For example, we need but to retrace events a few years back, in our own country, to know the cauſe and effect of the loſs of our circulating medium. The heavy balances due to Great-Britain, from cutting off our uſual remittances, by her commercial regulations, produced the uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, diſtruſts, and confuſions of the year 1786. The people, who had contracted debts, and made promiſes of ſpecie at one rate of value, found themſelves utterly unable, from its undue exportation, to fulfil them at another, i. e. an enhanced one, ariſing out of its ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city;—for inſtance, he who had bought a hundred buſhels of grain, and gave his note for it, at a given price, payable at an advanced period, ſay twelve months, found that it would require more than double the quantity of grain to diſcharge his note. In ſhort, ſuch were the diſorders introduced into the money tranſactions of the country, through this fertile ſource of public calamity, that public and private credit were for a long time ſuſpended, and confuſion and diſaffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to government, in ſome inſtances, grew out of the unfavourable balances of trade, grounded on Britiſh regulations of commerce.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the liquidating an unfavourable balance of trade with one country by a favourable one with another, it muſt be conſidered as a mean too precarious and uncertain to be calculated upon, in a ſyſtem of commercial regulations; for it cannot be expected to continue longer than until the nations, with which we have favourable balances, ſhall become
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:031857_0032_0FEF21FD53CC6F88"/>
apprized of their ſituation and intereſt. For inſtance; Can it rationally be expected, that France, with which we have had, before the preſent European war, a more favourable balance of trade than with any other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, amounting to 2,068,348 dollars, will not put further reſtrictions upon our commerce, or demand an equivalent, in ſome form or other; eſpecially when ſhe finds, that the balance ſhe pays to the United States, goes to feed and to nouriſh the commerce and power of her enemy? Every nation ought, then, to expect an unequal commerce will be retaliated, and that it will be reſtricted and retrenched, as times and opportunity preſent.</p>
            <p>Although there was a balance of trade of 235,975 dollars, in the year 1790, againſt the United States, yet it has been ſaid, that it has been ſometimes in their favour; but a little reflection upon what took place, prior to the preſent European war, will not only ſhew the ſuggeſtion unfounded; but will ſufficiently prove, that unleſs additional protection had been given to the commerce of the United States, what with the old debts due to Great-Britain, and thoſe which were daily accruing, there was much reaſon to fear, that the Engliſh commerce would, in a few years, have abſorbed the greater part, or all, of the perſonal property of the country; as the inſufficiency of the exports was made up, for ſeveral years, out of the public ſecurities, bank ſtocks, and an extenſive ſale of our wild lands in England; and although theſe operated as remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances to a vaſt amount, comprehending, as it has been ſuppoſed, one half of the national bank ſtocks, and one third, at leaſt, of the public debt of the United States; yet the concurrence of theſe circumſtances was not ſufficient to reduce the price of bills of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change. If theſe then are facts, and that they are, a reference to people in trade, and to the rates of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, until the beginning of the preſent European war, will fully evince;—muſt it not, then, be a ſerious cauſe of alarm, to ſee the ſame pernicious commercial
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:031857_0033_0FEF21FEDC41EAD0"/>
ſyſtem perſiſted in, almoſt without a ſuggeſtion, or an attempt, to retaliate the commercial policy of England? Well might the Britiſh miniſter exult, as he did, in the year 1790, that the independence of the United States had coſt nothing to Great-Britain; that ſo far from its proving an injury, it had ſaved the heavy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe of their protection; whilſt Great-Britain had derived greater commercial benefits, from the United States, than when they were colonies: or, in other words, that the American independence had been, and would continue, but a name, whilſt a phyſical depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence could be retained by commerce.</p>
            <p>If the power of regulating commerce, given to the United States, implies an obligation, it muſt have been intended, that the commerce ſhould be ſo man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged, that the annual imports ſhould not exceed the exports; or that the productions of foreign countries ſhould not be conſumed out of proportion to the means of paying for them, by the productions of the United States; for any thing ſhort of this, is not the regulation, but the miſmanagement of commerce; for the term regulation carries with it, the idea of a juſt and proper method of management, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the caſe, if this principle is unattended to.</p>
            <p>Baron Monteſquieu obſerves,<note n="*" place="bottom">Monteſquieu, book 20, chap. 12 and 13.</note> that the liberty of commerce depends upon its reſtraints; that it does not conſiſt, on the one hand, in an unbridled freedom to traders; nor yet in unjuſt impoſitions for the ſake of revenue, on the other: that government ſhould ſtand neuter between its commerce and revenues, and not ſuffer the intereſts of the latter to encroach upon the rights of the former.

<pb n="37" facs="unknown:031857_0034_0FEF2206B19E9B30"/>
that the public income ſhould not exceed the public expenditure:—In this caſe, the annual exports are the income, and the annual imports the expenditure; which, if the regulations of commerce do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol, ſo that the latter ſhould not exceed the former, it is a ſure mark, that the commerce is not ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſtrained. The impoſt laws of the United States allow the importation of every thing from abroad, whether wanted or not, on payment of the ſtipulated duties; but to allow the importation of ſuch articles, which we do not want, or can procure amongſt our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, muſt leſſen the capacity to obtain what we actually ſtand in need of. If we expend equally in what we do, and do not want, we muſt have a redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced quantity of what we do want, by the amount of the expenditure in what we do not want. To leſſen foreign importations, then, it is neceſſary to prohibit entry to ſuch articles as we can raiſe or manufacture amongſt ourſelves in ſufficient quantities, to ſupply the demand. High duties, by ſome called protecting duties, are ſeldom collected, or very imperfectly ſo, <hi>in countries even leſs ſuited to conceal ſmuggling than the United States;</hi> from whence it may be inferred, that prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions will afford greater ſecurity to American manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, than what are called protecting duties, which offer temptation to ſmuggling, produce little or no revenue, and juſtify the ſale, uſe, and conſumption of ſuch manufactures, which merit an excluſion. Sure it is, that means more effectual, than thoſe which have been hitherto deviſed, are neceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the ruinous and growing balance of trade, againſt the United States, in favour of Great-Britain. The ſtate of Maſſachuſetts prohibited the importation from abroad, of many articles of home produce, and manufacture, in the year 1786, which had a benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial effect, as to ſeveral of the articles; for whilſt the prohibition ſhut out foreign importation, ſuch was the competition produced in their manufacture, that many of the articles were ſupplied at a leſs price than
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:031857_0035_0FEF220A723E7128"/>
before their importation was prohibited. The article of nails, particularly, fell from ſeven and ſix pence, Maſſachuſetts currency, to five and four pence per thouſand; and the other articles of iron ware in a like proportion; whilſt the general prices of all were not enhanced by the prohibition. The articles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by Maſſachuſetts were as follows, viz. <note n="†" place="bottom">See Maſſachuſetts impoſt act, paſſed in the year 1786.</note>

               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:031857_0036_0FEF220C00E7D790"/>There is little doubt but moſt, if not all the foregoing articles, as well as many others, might be ſupplied, in ſufficient quantities, to anſwer the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the citizens of the United States, without foreign importation. Admitting this to be the caſe, ought not ſuch articles to be prohibited? ought not the citizens of the United States, who are taxed by, and ſubmit to the federal and ſtate governments, to be protected in their profeſſions and callings, againſt foreign interference? is it not bad economy for a government, acting in its perſonal capacity, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe what it does not want, or what its citizens do, or may procure of themſelves? is it not as reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to permit ſuch importations, as it would be for a farmer to allow himſelf to purchaſe wheat or corn, when he had the moſt ample means to procure a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of both? Abſolute prohibitions, therefore, upon all articles of foreign importation, interfering with our own manufactures, when their demand can be ſupplied; increaſing duties upon articles imported, which are of our own manufacture, until extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by prohibitions; heavy duties upon ſuch articles as we ought, and do not manufacture, as an encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement to their being undertaken, are the meaſures purſued by Great-Britain; and the means the moſt likely to promote manufactures, and to procure a more favourable balance of trade. But ſhould the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:031857_0037_0FEF220F0D0F6DF8"/>
preſent pernicious ſyſtem of commercial regulations be unalterably adhered to, and the produce and manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the United States meet no farther protection againſt foreign interference, would not the ſeparate ſtates be juſtified in levying an exciſe upon ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported articles, which produce an injurious effect upon their reſpective manufactures? for example, why ſhould not the farmers of the United States be entit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the excluſive ſale of their productions, eſpecially when they already ſuffer ſo many inconveniencies for the want of eſtabliſhed markets? why then ſhould not the articles of beef, cheeſe, porter, beer, and other articles, which appertain to the produce of the ſoil, be prohibited? do the protecting duties, as they are termed, exclude their conſumption? on the contrary, are not large ſums annually expended upon ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported articles? do they not produce a much greater injury from their importation, than the revenue, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from them, is a benefit? may it not be aſked, why theſe articles are not permitted entry into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land? and whether the policy of protecting the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of agriculture and manufactures, in its principle, does not apply as ſtrongly to the United States, as to Great-Britain? The beſt vent for the productions of every country, is that of its richeſt citizens, who, if ſupplied with what they uſe, through foreign nations, muſt proſtrate all efforts to improvement, and leave to the native farmers and artiſans, the ſupply of the poorer citizens only, who are unable to purchaſe, but of the inferior kinds. It is by prohibitions, and in the expenditures of the richer citizens, that the poorer are to be maintained, and the requiſite improvements in arts and manufactures are to be expected: and ſhall government, for the ſake of retaining duties, imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly collected, indulge luxury, pride, and vanity, at the expenſe of the public welfare? Are the ſums col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in this way, to be put in competition with the intereſts of the great body of huſbandmen and artiſans of the United States? Are they to be put in oppoſition
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:031857_0038_0FEF22126B04D528"/>
to the habits, manners, and independence of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try? If laws are intended to prevent public evils; if the impoſt laws, particularly, can be ſo conſtructed, as to leſſen luxury, to influence manners, and to induce habits of induſtry, economy, and moderation, ought not conſiderations of this ſort to have weight in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican government? Nations, like individuals, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer more from example, than by the natural progreſs of corruption. Every one, therefore, muſt wiſh, that if the American character ſhall be contaminated, it ſhould reſult from the ſlow progreſs of luxury, through its own improvements, rather than from the corrupt ſources of the tinſeled ſineries of Europe.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>
                     <q>The importer of foreign luxuries and fineries finds it greatly for his own profit to encourage a ſpirit of diſſipation and extravagance amongſt all ranks of people; for he not only reaps profit on them, but, in the mean time, he knows that what were accounted mere ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities at firſt, ſoon become neceſſaries of life, ſo that this trade will increaſe with the increaſing demand for them: It is his intereſt, therefore, and will be his ſtudy, to promote, as far as he can, that general ſpirit of extravagance and diſſipation, which is the moſt effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual bar to ſober induſtry, and the moſt certain means of deſtroying the internal felicity of every individual of the ſtate. In conſequence of this ſyſtem, the people ſoon become poor, and the profits of the dealer increaſe with their poverty; how abſurd then is it in mankind, to eſtimate the degree of improvement of a country by the richneſs of its merchants!</q>

            <p>Another object, perhaps of no leſs importance than what has been before intimated, to reduce an unfav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable balance of trade, may not be improper here to ſuggeſt: it is a meaſure of no leſs conſequence than to ſecure the commiſſions, or factorage, upon the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of our own markets with the productions and merchandizes of foreign countries: and it is conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that no better ſuggeſtion, for the purpoſe, can be readily offered, <hi>than an alien duty upon goods, wares, or productions of foreign countries, ſhipped for, or conſigned to
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:031857_0039_0FEF2217584C8520"/>
any other, than an American citizen; and that no draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back ſhould be allowed upon the exportation of articles, oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erwiſe ſhipped or conſigned, which had previouſly paid duty upon importation:</hi> By a meaſure of this ſort, the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States might calculate a ſaving, at leaſt, of two millions of dollars annually, which the commiſſions upon importation and exportation, calculated at 5 per cent. with incidental charges, would at leaſt amount to.</p>
            <p>American merchants, conſidered as ſuch, in relation to their country, ſtand in an important point of view; they are to be regarded as the inſtruments of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with foreign countries, of exciting do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic induſtry, of diffuſing proſperity and wealth, and of holding the capitals of the country, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to, in caſes of exigence or neceſſity. To ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that perſons, of this reſpectable claſs, ought not to find protection, in preference to thoſe of foreign nations, is to conſider that foreign merchants are not bound by ties and connections, which attach them to their native country; and that their opinions and ſentiments are diveſted of thoſe partialities, which commonly actuate the human heart. So fully do the Engliſh laws recognize this principle of attachment to their native country, that they ſuppoſe, if a merchant ſhall even aſſume a foreign allegiance, that it is only <hi>"local and temporary,"</hi> and that his natural allegiance is a perpetual, actuating principle, from which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be withdrawn without the "concurrent act of the government to which it was firſt due." <note n="*" place="bottom">See Blackſtone, book 1. chap. 10. p. 370.</note> This principle of the Engliſh law is likewiſe concurrent to another, quite as generally received, and better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, which is, <hi>that the profits obtained in commerce, if carried on by foreigners, will be expended out of the country, in which they were procured.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When we reflect upon the numerous evils, ariſing from the profits of labour, (which moſt commonly center in commerce), being expended out of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:031857_0040_0FEF2218E29057C8"/>
to which they properly belong; that a gradual poverty, and an accumulating miſery, are its never failing conſequence, as may be exemplified in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Scotland and Ireland, particularly the latter, where their wealth, being principally expended in England, inſtead of nouriſhing the ſources, from whence it is derived, has reduced the inhabitants to the loweſt ſtate of beggary and wretchedneſs. In proportion, therefore, as a country ſuffers its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce to be carried on by foreigners, will its citizens become depreſſed and impoveriſhed. Virginia, the two Carolinas, and Georgia, afford an additional ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in point, where Engliſh and Scotch merchants and factors carry on the commerce, and retire to their native country, with the wealth which they thereby acquire, to the injury of thoſe ſtates. To ſuppoſe, then, that a diſtinction ought not to be made, between American merchants and thoſe of other countries; and that the diſabilities of foreign merchants ought not to be increaſed in the United States, when ſo many inconveniencies muſt ariſe from the eſtabliſhing of a foreign influence, from the transferring the profits of commerce to a foreign country, and from withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the credits and capitals from the country, at a time of exigence, or of war, when they may be moſt needed, is, in every point of view, a proſtration, both of national and commercial policy. For this purpoſe, additional and ſpecial impediments ſhould be thrown in the way of naturalizing merchant ſtrangers, in order to procure the preferences and advantages herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated. When we conſider the numerous diſabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of foreigners, carrying on trade in Great-Britain, the commercial impoſitions to which they are ſubject, and the reſtraints which meet them in every direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:—that reſidence procures no remiſſion to thoſe reſtraints, except in the Britiſh plantations<note n="*" place="bottom">

<pb n="44" facs="unknown:031857_0041_0FEF221C0308DEE8"/>

            <p>Although the acts, from which the foregoing clauſes are tranſcribed, paſſed in the 12th and 15th years of the reign of Charles 2d. and the 26th and 27th of George 3d. yet the firſt act was produced during Cromwell's protectorſhip, at the inſtigation of Mr. St. John, who, through reſentment, from an unſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful negotiation with which he had been charged to the ſtates of Holland, procured its adoption. The policy of theſe acts, the pride and boaſt of Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,

and to which they ſhew an enthuſiaſtic, if not a bigoted attachment, has been, and is ſtill conſidered as the foundation of the maritime importance of England. Lord Hawkeſborough, in his diſcourſe with regard to neutral nations, calls Cromwell's act <q>A NOBLE STRAIN OF COMMERCIAL POLICY, which hath proved the fertile ſource of all the naval pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which hath operated inſenſibly to the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and hath been the ſpring from whence hath flowed, the wealth and greatneſs of England.</q>
            </p>
            <p>How far <hi>this noble ſtrain of commercial policy</hi> ought to be reſiſted, or harmonized with; and whether, in the poetic language of the noble Lord, the United States ought to echo to the ſong, and in notes reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, bear up its lengthened ſound, let it be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the following obſervations to examine.</p>
            <p>Admitting the advantages of navigation, and of a carrying trade, to be unqueſtionable, as a mean of wealth and defence, which will ſcarcely be denied;— a commercial intercourſe ought equally, as has been already ſuggeſted, to reciprocate ſuch advantages;— and the benefits received ſhould equal thoſe which are beſtowed: But the inquiry recurs, What is the ſtate of the caſe, as it reſpects the important ſubject in diſcuſſion? It is, in fact, that in the year end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the 1ſt of October, 1790, the United States al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to the veſſels of Great-Britain, five times the direct freightage that they received; and of courſe, our carrying trade contributed to the wealth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Great-Britain in the proportion of four parts in five, at leaſt, of what it did to the advantage and benefit of the United States!!</p>
            <p>The whole tonnage of veſſels, on which duty was paid in the United States, in the aforementioned year, was 761,710 tons, of which there were belonging to the United States 492,100 tons, to other nations 269, 610 tons, of which Great-Britain had 226,953 tons<note n="*" place="bottom">See Mr. Jefferſon's ſtatement to Congreſs in December, 1793.

whereby Great-Britain drew for the freightage, calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating but one trip, or two paſſages to the veſſels, at the mean rate of fifty ſhillings ſterling per ton, on each paſſage, 1,134,765 pounds ſterling, which ſum, if rendered into dollars, amounts to 5,043,400 dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, or about one quarter part of the value of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of the United States, by the employment of eleven hundred and thirty-four ſhips, of two hundred tons each; which, if calculated to carry twelve men to each veſſel, employed 13,608 ſeamen; whilſt the direct freightage of American veſſels, to and from the Britiſh dominions, employed no more than 43,580<note n="*" place="bottom">See Mr. Jefferſon's ſtatement.</note> tons of ſhipping, leaving the immenſe balance of 183,370 tons in favour of the ſhipping of Great-Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ain:—ſo that he relative advantages, on the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the reſpective ſhips and ſeamen of the two countries, ſtood in the proportion of two hundred and eighteen ſhips to eleven hundred and thirty-four: in ſeamen, of 2,616 to 13,608—and in the value of freightage, 968,444 dollars to 5,043,400, without taking into view the advantage of freightage from port to port, permitted to Engliſh veſſels in the United States, and not allowed to American veſſels in the Britiſh dominions, which muſt add much to the already too glaring diſparity.</p>

                              <q>The value of the exports of the two years 1794 and 1795 was 80,000,000 of dollars, and of the two years 1791 and 1792 did not amount to 40 millions. That prodigious augmentation cannot be viewed as permanent, unleſs owing to the increaſe of the quantity of articles of our own growth, or manufacture, that were exported. But it has already been ſtated, that that quantity has received but a trifling addition, if any, ſince the former period. That increaſe is due to mere temporary cauſes; the firſt ariſing from an advanced price, of perhaps forty per cent. upon the total amount of our exports, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their uſual value; the ſecond, from our having become the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers of a large proportion of the produce of ſome of the Weſt-India iſlands. Thoſe two items, both of which are owing to the preſent European war, conſtitute nearly one half of the value of our exports for the two laſt years.</q>

            <p>See Tench Coxe's ſtatement of exports, in his view of the United States.</p>
            <p>Obſerve, that the above ſtatement does not include the imports or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports to and from the Britiſh colonies.</p>
            <p>If the foregoing ſtatements are founded upon facts; (for it is by facts and ſtatements of this ſort that the commercial policy of a country muſt be adjudged);— if they juſtly point out the relative advantages, ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the commerce and navigation of the two countries, can there be a doubt remaining, as to the ill policy of our exiſting regulations of commerce?
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:031857_0054_0FEF2249B9AAF468"/>
and is it not obvious, that a balance of trade, ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe in its amount, and ſo ruinous in its conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, threatning both public and private credit with ſhipwreck, ought, by ſome means or other, to be remedied? and to what meaſure, concurrent to thoſe already ſuggeſted, can we better recur, than to an American navigation act, ſimilar to that of Great-Britain? It is a meaſure of juſtice to ourſelves, of protection to our citizens, and of reciprocity to Great-Britain. Tench Coxe, in his view of the United States, obſerves upon it, <q>That the article of the Britiſh trade laws, which confines the importation of foreign goods to the bottoms of the country producing them, and of their own citizens, appears applicable to our ſituation. By means of thoſe two flags, we ſhould be certain of the neceſſary importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and we ſhould throw out of each department of the carrying trade, every competitor, except the ſhips of the nation by which the goods were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced or manufactured. All trade with ſeveral countries, ſuch as China and India, whoſe veſſels ſeldom or never make foreign voyages, would be ſecured in our own hands. It will be found, that a modified application of this regulation, in practice, will be attended with no difficulties or inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; and beſides the immediate benefits already mentioned, our merchants will be led <hi>directly</hi> to the <hi>original</hi> market for the ſupplies of which we ſtand in need. Inſtead of purchaſing goods of Ruſſia, or the Eaſt-Indies, in England, France, or Holland, our own ſhips will ſail directly to the fountain, from whence they have hitherto flowed to us through foreign channels. The credits given to us in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, after the peace, kept us in the practice of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a very few places, for all our importations. But they have truſted us, in many inſtances, at a dear rate indeed; and however uſeful credit may be, as a ſupplement to our means of trade, in this young country, it is very certain that we ſhould

firſt lay out to the beſt advantage, our funds in hand.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Leſt it may be objected, that the reforms herein ſuggeſted, in the commercial ſyſtem of the United States, might impugn the revenue, and thereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce miſchief and diſorder in the public finances;— but as this is neither intended, nor expected; and with a view to prevent ſuch a ſuggeſtion, as well as to avoid unneceſſary amplification, it may not be improp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſuggeſt the following queries.</p>
            <p>Query 1. Whether the revenue upon goods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, ought to be calculated upon, beyond the value of the goods or produce exported?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether an increaſe of revenue, ariſing from an undue importation in one year, muſt not be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by a reduced revenue in ſucceeding years; and if the exceſs be repeated, (the imports exceeding the exports), whether the revenue, grounded upon ſuch importations, will not be ſubjected to a gradual reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if not a final extinction?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whether the amount of the importations would in fact be diminiſhed by particular prohibitions, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeveral years together; and whether the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of articles, unneceſſary and luxurious, would not produce the ſame revenue, by the increaſe of ſuch ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles as were uſeful and convenient?</p>
            <p n="4">4. And, laſtly, Whether a diminution in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue from a partial excluſion of foreign tonnage, by an American navigation act, might not readily be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnified by an increaſed duty upon the domeſtic?</p>
            <p>Before the preſent ſubject is concluded, it may not be improper to make a few additional obſervations.</p>
            <p>An American navigation act, it is conceived, muſt operate not leſs beneficially to the agricultural, than to the commercial ſtates, by giving ſecurity to the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of their produce to foreign markets at all times, and eſpecially in times of war; and ſhould it be ſound, that the competition, in the ſupply of veſſels, ſhould not at firſt be ſufficient to furniſh the freight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:031857_0056_0FEF224EEBEA66B0"/>
at the loweſt rates, (which muſt ſoon be the caſe,) the agricultural ſtates, under ſuch circumſtances, would be wanting in a juſt view of their true intereſts, not to co-operate in the meaſures neceſſary to produce it: In proof of which, it may be aſked, what would have been the probable ſituation of the ſouthern ſtates, from the preſent European war, if the United States had been without navigation? Their produce muſt, in all probability, have periſhed upon their hands, or have been tranſported to market at ſo heavy an expenſe, as to have left little to the profit of their lands: whereas they have found immenſe prices for their productions, whilſt our ſhips and veſſels have had ample and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous freights for their tranſportation. The union of the commercial and agricultural intereſt in this, as in moſt other caſes, has been found contributive to the general welfare; and perhaps no meaſure of more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral policy, or particular advantage, applying to the northern and ſouthern ſtates, could be readily deviſed for the mutual benefit of agriculture and commerce, than an American navigation act, upon the principles herein propoſed.</p>
            <p>But when we conſider the encouragement of navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation as contributive to the general defence, without going far into the hiſtory of ancient or modern na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, there are few or no inſtances of a country hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extenſive colonies or poſſeſſions abroad, or of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying power or reſpectability at home, or among the neighbouring ſtates, without the aid of a maritime force. Navigation, as a nurſery of ſeamen, and as a mean of beſtowing wealth and power, is found, by experience, to be among the firſt objects of national policy. The Carthagenians maintained their indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and were ſucceſsful rivals to the Roman power, as long as they preſerved their naval ſuperiority:— The moſt brilliant achievements of the Athenians were through the means of their fleets:—<q>The anſwer giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by the oracle of Delphi to the Athenians, to fortify their city with wooden walls againſt the invaſion of
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:031857_0057_0FEF225537E7EF78"/>
Xerxes, is an advice which has been ſucceſsfully adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the French and Engliſh,<note n="*" place="bottom">Poſtlethwaite</note>
               </q> and ought to be operative upon the citizens and government of the United States.</p>
            <p>France, by the eſtabliſhment of diſtant colonies, and by laying a duty, amounting to a prohibition, upon foreign ſhipping, in the time of Lewis 14th, gained ſuch an aſcendency upon the ocean, that her fleets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came formidable to thoſe of England, Holland, and Spain: England, although always known as a mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time power, yet from the time of King Edgar, to that of Queen Elizabeth, made no great figure upon the ocean:—Her colonies, principally Virginia, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Carolinas, added to the wiſe proviſions and prohibitions of her navigation acts, firſt laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and afterwards eſtabliſhed her maritime im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.</p>
            <p>To the policy of theſe acts ought the citizens of the United States to have recourſe, as a mean of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing their country's proſperity and power, as a meaſure of ſecurity againſt foreign invaſion;—to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy and to protect their commerce, to aſſure to them the juſt reward of their labour, and to protect it againſt foreign interference:—as a defenſive meaſure, to equalize the advantages of commerce with foreign nations; to place prohibitions againſt prohibitions, and generally to ſecure thoſe benefits, to which their ſituation, productions and good policy ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title them.</p>
            <p>To conclude:—Fellow-Citizens of the United States! let not <hi>"partial views, or local prejudices,"</hi> deter you from a due conſideration of the meaſures herein recommended: weigh well your commercial and political ſituation with Great-Britain! Let unity of action and deſign (the chief characteriſtics of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) mark your meaſures and councils!—Weak— timid—yielding politics never yet achieved any thing of importance!—It is for you to ſay, whether you
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:031857_0058_0FEF2256C0163398"/>
will be a great, independent, enterpriſing and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding people;—or a weak—dependent—timid— and degraded one!—Speak the word, infuſe your influence into your government; and thoſe acts and meaſures will ſoon be purſued, which will not only ſecure you againſt the impending evils, which threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en you, but will waft to your favoured ſhores, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive wealth, proſperity, and power.</p>
