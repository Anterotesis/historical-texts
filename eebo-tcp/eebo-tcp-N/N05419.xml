            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>We give Thanks to almighty GOD for the Preſervation of you and us, and giving us this Opportunity of ſeeing each other in Health.</p>
                     <p>We hope you appear fully impowered on your Part to go upon the Buſineſs we are met upon.</p>
                     <p>However, Before we proceed, we can't but take Notice of the unfriendly Behaviour of the <hi>Norridgawocks</hi>; who, after ſome of their Tribe were kindly receiv'd and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd at <hi>Boſton,</hi> return'd and repeatedly came upon our Frontiers; kill'd divers of our People, and carried others into Captivity, and alſo deſtroyed their Cattle: And, beſides this, one of their People return'd the Treaty made at <hi>Falmouth</hi> in 1749, deliver'd it to Capt. <hi>Lithgow</hi> at <hi>Richmond</hi>; which looks as if they made no Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it; Therefore we expect they will let us know, whether this latter was the Act of their Tribe, or done only by a particular Indian, without their Order and Conſent.</p>
                     <p>The Engliſh are diſpoſed for the Continuance of Peace; and as a Proof thereof, the Government have directed us to aſſure you, That upon the Renewal of your Friendſhip with them, and ſo long as you (and the other Tribes of Eaſtern Indians) ſhall continue in Amity with the Engliſh, and keep firm and inviolable the Peace made; they may depend upon receiving from the Government, in the Month of <hi>October</hi> annually, a ſuitable Preſent in Token of the Friendſhip ſubſiſting between them and this Government; which we, in the Name of the Government, accordingly now do.</p>

                     <p>YOU were pleas'd Yeſterday to tell us, We were but few in Number, which was true; but yet, if we were but Four, it is the ſame, as if all the Tribe was preſent.</p>
                     <p>There is a Number of the <hi>Norridgawock</hi> Tribe and two of the St. <hi>John's</hi> Tribe here; you will hear what they have to ſay to you.</p>
                     <p>There has of late Miſchief been done among us; but now we are all come to bury it: In order whereto, we are for proceeding upon Governour DUMMER's Treaty, by which it was concluded, That the Engliſh ſhould inhabit the Lands as far as the Salt-Water flowed, and no further; and that the Indians ſhould poſſeſs the reſt. Now,</p>
                     <p>Brethren,</p>
                     <p>We deſire that both you and we ſhould endeavour, to the beſt we can, to obſerve this Treaty; which if we do will end in Peace.</p>
                     <p>We again ſay, That we will follow Mr. DUMMER's Treaty; and either of us that act contrary to it, let him be puniſh'd; and, if either Party have acted contrary hereunto, let it now be ſetled, and not go any further, leaſt it lay the Foundation of a War between us.</p>
                     <p>All the Tribes of Indians knew that there was to be a Treaty here, and have conſented to it.</p>
                     <p>Brethren,</p>
                     <p>As I ſaid before, ſo I now ſay, That the Lands we own, let us enjoy; and let no Body take them from us. We ſaid the ſame to thoſe of our own Religion, the <hi>French.</hi> Altho' we are a Black People, yet GOD hath planted us here: GOD gave us this Land, and we will keep it. GOD decreed all Things; He decreed this Land to us; therefore neither ſhall the <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Engliſh</hi> poſſeſs it, but we will. This is agreeable both to King GEORGE and the <hi>French</hi> King; they wou'd have neither the <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>French</hi> diſturb us in our Right; which if they ſhould, would ſet all theſe Lands on Fire.</p>

Altho' our Beaver fetches a great Sum, it will purchaſe but a ſmall Matter of your Goods.

                     <p>Brethren,</p>
                     <p>Lay theſe Things up in-your Hearts, and carry them Home with you.</p>

                  <p>What is doing there, is by private Perſons who imagine they have an undoubted Right to thoſe Lands; and that if the Title of thoſe Perſons ſhou'd be good, it is not agreable to the Conſtitution of our Government to diſpoſſeſs Men of their Right: However, You may depend upon it, that the Government will examine into their Title to thoſe Lands, and endeavour to give you Satisfaction in this Point when you receive your Preſents the next Year.</p>

                        <p>IN the Morning you mentioned to us the Article of Trade; which you deſire may be agreeable to Covernour DUMMER's Treaty, inaſmuch as the Beaver you bring in, (tho' it ſells for a great Sum yet) fetches but little of our Goods. To which we reply, That if it be more agreable to you, to ſix your Furrs at the Prices they were at in Governour DUMMER's Time; we are ready to agree that you ſhall have our Goods at that Price alſo: But would endeavour to convince you, that as the Trade is now carried on, it is more to your Advantage; that is, you get more 
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:006861_0010_102A7E8D4A40B5C8"/>
Profit now, than you did in Governour DUMMER's Day: And here we will give you one Inſtance; Then you gave us Five Pounds of Spring Beaver for Eight Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons of Rum; but now you give us but Four Pounds for that Quantity; and ſo it is as to moſt of the other Articles, both of Furrs and Goods. We are perſwaded you muſt be miſtaken as to your Furrs ſelling better at <hi>Albany</hi> than here, inaſmuch as the Merchants who purchaſe your Beaver there, ſend it to <hi>Boſton</hi> for a Market; which they would never do, if they did not buy it at ſuch a Rate as to give them ſome Profit.</p>
                        <p>However, You may depend on Juſtice being done you, both as to the Prices of our Goods, as well as of your Furs.</p>
