         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHereas the Proprietors of <hi>Eaſt-New-Jarſey</hi> have been very preſſing with the Right Honourable, the Lords Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners for Trade and Plantations, to have the Priviledge of a Port at <hi>Perth-Amboy</hi> within the ſaid Collony of <hi>New-Jarſey,</hi> aſſertaining that they have a Right thereunto by virtue of a Grant they obtained from the late King <hi>James,</hi> dated the 14th of <hi>March,</hi> 1682. though in reality he was then only <hi>Duke of York,</hi> and derived his Title thereunto from a preceeding Grant from his Royal Brother King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond; and have thereupon complained, that their Rights and Properties have been invaded by the Government of <hi>New-York,</hi> in compelling their Ships to go up to <hi>New-York,</hi> and d<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ing of them the benefit of a Port at <hi>Perth-Amboy.</hi> Which Complaint having been taken into the Conſideration of the ſaid Right Honourable, the Lords Commiſſioners for Trade and Plantations, who, with the Advice of his Majeſties Attorney and Sollicitor General, gave unto His Majeſty their humble Opinion, That by an Act of Parliament made in the 2<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th Year of King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond, cap. 7. entituled, <hi>An Act for the better ſecuring the Plantation Trade,</hi> That all Ports are to be appointed in the Plantations by the Commiſſioners of the Cuſtoms of <hi>England,</hi> by and under the Authority and Direction of the Lord Treaſurer, or Commiſſioners of the Treaſury in the reſpective Plantations, for the collecting ſuch Cuſtoms as are due to his Majeſty in theſe Plantations. And that the aforeſaid Power of appointing Ports, granted to the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners of the Cuſtoms by the ſaid Act, was not granted to the <hi>Duke of York</hi> by the ſaid Letters Patents; and alſo the ſaid <hi>Duke of York</hi>'s Grant to the Lord <hi>Berkley</hi> and Sir <hi>George Carteret</hi> could not convey any ſuch Power, becauſe he had no ſuch power granted to him by the Crown. Whereupon it appeareth evident, That the ſaid Proprietors have no manner of Right or Power to conſtitute Ports either in <hi>Eaſt</hi> or <hi>Weſt New Jarſey,</hi> from the late King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond, the then <hi>Duke of York,</hi> or any other Perſon deriving Authority from either of them, but that a Power of conſtituting ſuch Ports in any of his Majeſties Plantations, is veſted by Act of Parliament in the Commiſſioners of his Majeſties Cuſtoms, under the Directions of the Lords Commiſſioners of his Majeſty's Treaſury.</p>
            <p>And the ſaid Right Honourable, the Lords Commiſſioners of Trade and Plantations were further humbly of Opinion, That all Priviledges ſhould, as much as poſſible, be preſerved unto the Province of <hi>New-York.</hi> Which his Majeſty was most graciouſly pleaſed to Approve; and thereupon was pleaſed to diſmiſs the ſaid Petition of the Proprietors of <hi>Eaſt New-Jarſey</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to order, That there be not any Innovation within the River of <hi>New-York,</hi> nor any Goods to paſs up the ſame, but what ſhall have paid the Duties at <hi>New York,</hi> to the end the benefit of that Trade may be preſerved to the Inhabitants and Traders of <hi>New York</hi> and <hi>Albany,</hi> the ſame being agreeable to the Laws of his Majeſties ſaid Province, and to former Practice as well as neceſſary for the collecting of thoſe Cuſtoms and other Duties which are to be raiſed for the ſupport of His Majeſties Government in his ſaid Province.</p>
            <p>And whereas I am Informed, That notwithſtanding of the Declaration of His Majeſties Royal Will and pleaſure in the Premiſes, the Proprietors and other the Inhabitants of the ſaid <hi>Eaſt New-Jarſey,</hi> do contrary thereunto, endeavour to ſettle and eſtabliſh a Port at <hi>Perth-Amboy,</hi> to the great Obſtruction and Decay of the Trade and Revenue of this His Majeſties Province. I have therefore thought fit, by and with the Advice and Conſent of His Majeſties Council, ſtrictly to charge and command his Majeſties Collector and Receiver General of this His Majeſties Province of <hi>New-York,</hi> and all Cuſtom Houſe-Officers under him, and all other perſon and Perſons whom theſe Preſents may or can concern, that all and every of them in their reſpective Places and Circumſtances, do take effectual care that no Ship or Veſſel be ſuffered or permitted to go unto <hi>Perth-Amboy,</hi> or unto any other Port or Place within the ſaid <hi>Eaſt-New-Jarſey</hi> with any Goods or Merchandize whereon any Duties or Cuſtoms do ariſe by virtue of the Laws of <hi>England</hi> and this Province, without their firſt coming and entring the ſame in his Majeſties Cuſtom-Houſe at New York, and paying there the aforeſaid Duties eſtabliſhed by the Laws, as aforeſaid. And if any Ship or Veſſel ſhall, contrary hereunto, go into any Port or Harbour in the ſaid <hi>New-Jarſey,</hi> then his Majeſties Collector and Receiver General, or any Officer appointed by him, ſhall ſeize and ſtop the ſame un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcharged by due courſe of Law. And all Perſons are hereby ſtrictly Charged and Commanded to take Notice hereof accordingly, as they will anſwer the contrary at their Peril.</p>
