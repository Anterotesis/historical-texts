            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The following relation being large, I shall endeavour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

When these <hi>Man-eaters</hi> fury was at height, their knives in one hand, and the poor Shipwrakt People's heads in the other; their knees upon the others shoulders, and their looks dismal; on a suddain; the <hi>Sava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> were struck dumb, and their countenances changed, that

they looked like another People; the <hi>Casseekey</hi> (or <hi>King</hi>) becoming as a safegard to the distressed, from the injuries of his own men: Nay, such confidence put he in them, that he would trust them to remove the mony, he had taken from themselves, before he would trust his own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When they were got from these to another place, where they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> God prevented any further mischief, than the stripping them of those poor rags the others had left them, and some other abuses, which by that time were grown familiar to them, and were looked upon as <hi>light afflictions.</hi> The <hi>Cassee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky's</hi> Wife being made an instrument for their delivery, she and some others having some thing of tenderness of heart in them, though amongst such an inhumane crew.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Many were the particular deliverances upon occasion of injuries offered. Once, an <hi>Arrow</hi> shot at them narrowly escaped them. Another time, some going to shoot Arrows at them, certain of their own company caught hold of their Bows and arms; Nay, though some of them shot, yet their arrows mist. Not to mention the frequent dangers they were in, upon every slight suspicion of their being <hi>English</hi>

Neither is it so wonderfull that they are thus cruel to strangers, since they are unnatural to their own aged People; they having no more compassion on them, than to make them Slaves to the younger. Yet are these <hi>Man-eaters</hi> as cowardly as cruel; when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> came up, the sight of a rusty musket presented towards them, would make severall of them flie.</p>

Another time, by reason of a great Flood, they were forced to remove their lodgings several times, and for divers daies, were in a continual apprehension of being drowned, at length were preserved upon an <hi>Oyster-hill.</hi> Not to mention the frequent dangers they were in, by reason of the extream cold, too tedious to touch at here. Wherein this however is remarkable; that God can both administer strength in the midst of weakness, and also take away strength, and cause weakness to seize, whenever he pleases: Here was an old man, a Woman with a sucking child, and another with child Persons, seemingly, very unlikely to encounter such hardships, all escaped, and divers <hi>Negro's,</hi> used to more hardiness, perished.</p>

            <p>'This man of God, whose habitation was in one of the Northern Counties of <hi>England,</hi> was early convinced of the blessed truth of God, professed by the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi>
               <pb facs="unknown:000863_0006_0FAC039FD67B0528"/>
and soon after had <hi>a dispensation of the Gospel committed</hi> to him. He lived in his Native Country, in esteem amongst his Neighbours, for his godly conversation, and honoured in the Church of God, as an Elder vvho had abode faithfull in his testimony, both in preaching the Gospel, suffering <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>That he had rather immediately have laid down his natural life there, if by so doing he could have kept his peace with God, than to have crossed the Seas to America.</q>
Well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hither he came, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

How he behaved himself under them, is therein expressed, with what patience he was carried through them, with what faith he overcame, even the very worst of men, so that it may be said, He was <hi>more than a Conquerour</hi> over those blood thirsty <hi>Canibals, looking to Him Who was invisible,</hi> and by his grace seeing beyond them and their cruelty; by Prayer <hi>wrest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And doubtles, he was made a strength and a comfort, to his companions in affliction, whose remembrance will not be easily blotted out of their minds.</p>

Thus striving in a deep Exercise of Body and Mind We travelled on, admiring Gods goodness in preserving us thus farr through so many eminent Dangers. In the sence of which a secret hope would arise, (though involved with human doubts and fear) thar the Lord would yet preserve us. I took my Child from the Negroe and carried him.

the Bank. This increased my Wife, a sorrow; and she began to doubt she should not be able to travell much further: But I endeavoured to incourage her not to leave striving as long as any ability was left. All our People were out of sight exept Four, and those We had gained upon. I sent my Negroe to overtake them, and to disire them to slacken their pace till we gott up with them; being in hopes that gaining their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany would to cheere up my Wife: But they would not; so the Negroe stopt for us.

The Sun was nigh Setting; and we began to look out for the sentinalls Post; and my Negroe at times gott upon severall of the highest Sand-hills to look out, but could not see any house, nor the smoak of Fire: This was terrible to us all, for the day being so cold, the night much more, and we not able to travell without rest, being a starved People both within our bodies and without, and if we ceased from travelling, we should instantly be nummed and move no further.
