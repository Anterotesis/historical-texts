            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </hi> on that Occaſion, with all poſſible Modeſty moved, that the King ſhould be Humbly Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd for the Liberty of an Aſſembly, they were Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Priſon for an <hi>High Miſdemeanour,</hi> and were Denied an <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> &amp; Drag'd many Miles out of their own County to Anſwer it at a Court in <hi>Boſton,</hi> where <hi>Jurors</hi> were pickt for the Turn, that were neither <hi>Free-holders,</hi> nor ſo much as <hi>Inhabitants.</hi> They were all Fined ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and laid under great Bonds for their <hi>Good Behaviour;</hi> beſides which, the Hungry Officers Extorted Fees of near Two Hundred Pounds, where they would not have riſen to Ten Pounds, had any Law of <hi>England,</hi> or Juſtice been Obſerved. The Townſmen of many other Places were ſerved in the like Faſhion; and our Judge <hi>Dudley</hi> was a Principal Actor in all this Wickedneſs. It was now denyed that any Man was owner of a Foot of Land in all the Colony. Judge <hi>Dudley</hi> gave it as his Judgment un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Hand. <hi>Writs of Intruſion</hi> were preſently ſerved upon the Chief Gentlemen in the Country, to Compel them, and others by the Terror of their Example, to take <hi>Patents</hi> for the Lands which they had quietly poſſeſſed for Fifty or Sixty Years together. For theſe <hi>Patents</hi> there were ſuch Exorbitant Prices demanded, that Fifty Pounds would not purchaſe for its owner, an Eſtate not worth Two Hundred; nor could all the Money and Moveables in the Territory, have defrayed the Charges of Pattenting the Lands.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Harpies</hi> were at any Time a little out of Money, they Invented Pretences to Impriſon the Beſt Men in the Country, and tho' there Appeared not the leaſt Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any Crime againſt them, yet they were put unto intollerable Expences, and the Benefit of the <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> was denied unto them. Judge <hi>Dudley</hi> knows this, and we ſuppoſe he has not forgotten either Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell <hi>Saltonstal,</hi> or Major <hi>Appleton.</hi> Pickt <hi>Juries</hi> were commonly uſed, for the Trouble of Honeſt and Worthy
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002214_0008_0FDACEF4D2E3B180"/>Men, and they were hurried out of their own Counties to be tryed, where Juries for their Turn were not likely to be found there. Judge <hi>Dudley</hi> knows this; and we ſuppoſe he remembers the famous Mr. <hi>Morton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In ſhort, all things were going to Wreck, but yet Col. <hi>Dudley</hi> was like to enrich himſelf and his Family in the general Ship-wreck. There lies the Myſtery!</p>
               <p>Theſe things, and many more ſuch things, are aſſerted in the Book aforeſaid, not only by the Oaths of many honeſt Gentlemen, but alſo by a Declaratian Signed by the Honourable Hands of Judge <hi>Stoughton,</hi> and Major General <hi>Winthrop,</hi> and Collonel <hi>Shrimpton,</hi> and other Members of the Council.</p>
               <p>The World has heard how narrowly Col. <hi>Dudley</hi> eſcaped a <hi>De-Witting</hi> for theſe his Follies, from the inraged Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the <hi>Revolution.</hi> Being then ſent over a Priſouer to <hi>England,</hi> he with the reſt, were here ſet at Liberty. He returned, with a Commiſſion for the Place of <hi>Chief Judge</hi> in the Province of <hi>New-York,</hi> where his firſt Work, after his Arrival was, to Condemn to Death, the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Governour of the Province, and another Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, for not ſurrendring the Government before Governour <hi>Slaughter</hi> arriv'd with his Commiſſion. The Condemnation and Execution of theſe two Gentlemen, was a Bloody Buſineſs: It was afterwards Examined in Parliament, where Colonel <hi>Dudley</hi> underwent a Confuſion which will never be worn off; and Mr. <hi>Conſtantine Phips,</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted the Matter with ſo much Demonſtration, that Eminent Perſons in both Houſes, declared it, <hi>A Barbarous Murder;</hi> King, Lords, and Commons, did as good as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it ſo, and by an <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> Revoked the <hi>Attainder</hi> of the Murdered Gentlemen.

                           </head>
                           <p n="1">I. ONE Principal Grievance, which Comprehends many under it, is, The Courſe of <hi>Bribery,</hi> which runs thro' the Governours Adminiſtration, whereby the Queen's Government is greatly Expoſed in a Country where <hi>Bribery</hi> has rarely, if ever before this, been known to be Practiſed. The Governour having brought in his Son to be Attorney General, this Corruption is the more effectually carried on between them, unto the great Oppreſſion of the People.</p>
                           <p>Only two Inſtances, among many, ſhall be reported in this Memorial.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Certain People having purchaſed Land at a New Plantation called <hi>Naſhoba,</hi> and wanting a Confirmation of their Title, by an Act of the General Aſſembly, as is Uſual in ſuch Caſes) they could not have the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour's Aſſent unto the Act, without a <hi>Bribe</hi> of a Thouſand Acres of the beſt Land, and in the Center of the Plantation, and to the Ruin of the reſt.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Alſo, a Tract of Land at <hi>Nipmuck,</hi> belonging to
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002214_0010_0FDACEF7D2CEF4E8"/>Nine or Ten Partners, when both Houſes in the General Aſſembly had paſſed the <hi>Bill,</hi> to Allow their Title, (as was Requiſite by an Old Law of the Country) the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour would not Sign the Act, until he had a Bribe of Twenty Pounds, and one whole Share of the Land, which was valued at One Hundred and Fifty Pounds more.</p>
                           <p>But, if a <hi>Commiſſion of Enquiry</hi> could be Obtained, there would be ſuch Practices of this Nature Diſcovered as are hardly to be P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>rrallel'd.</p>
                           <p n="2">II. The Governour, meerly to gratify his own Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Will and Pleaſure did for ſome while Refuſe to fill up the neceſſary Number of Judges; by which Means, the <hi>Courts</hi> dropt, and the <hi>Courſe of Juſtice</hi> was Obſtructed; and the oppreſſed People were Defeated in their Suits, to the Damage of many Hundreds of Pounds.</p>
                           <p n="3">III. There have been odd <hi>Colluſions</hi> with the Pirates of <hi>Quelch's</hi> Company, of which one Inſtance is, That there was extorted the Sum of about Thirty Pounds from ſome of the Crue, for Liberty to walk at certain times in the Priſon Yard; and this Liberty having been allow'd for Two or Three Days unto them, they were again confined to their former wretched Circumſtances.</p>
                           <p n="4">IV. An Army of Volunteers went out, and did Good Service upon the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indian</hi> Enemy at <hi>Acady.</hi> They were encouraged by an Act of the Governour and General Aſſembly, which promiſed the Soldiers a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Share of the Plunder. When the Soldiers returned, ſome Officers, without their Conſent or Knowledge, and before the Diviſion of the Plunder, made the Governour a conſiderable Preſent out of it; whereupon he ſo managed the Matter with the ſaid Officers, as to cheat and cut on the Soldiers of near one Half that the Act <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                              </gap> the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly had promiſed them! When the Houſe of Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives applied themſelves to the Governour on this Occaſion, they could get nothing from him. <hi>By this means, no more Volunteers are like to appear in her Majeſty's Service.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>

The Governour's manner is, to trample on the Aſſembly with groſs Indignities; and ſuch as they have never received from former Governours. Nor can they have any Redreſs of Grievances, tho' many have been from time to time repreſented.</p>
                           <p>And when Bills for the Payment of the juſt Debts of the Province, are preſented to him to be ſigned, he has declared, he would not ſign them, except he were himſelf gratified with Sums demanded of them.</p>
                           <p>On theſe, and many more ſuch Accounts, it is humbly conceived that it would be much for her Majeſty's In tereſt, if a more acceptable Governour were placed over that Province.</p>

Hereupon the Flexible Honeſt Men, perfectly Worried, and Wearied our of their Lives, by Three Weeks Alterations, did ſo many go over, as to make a ſort of a Vote of it. But the Concluſion of their Letters to Sir <hi>Henry Aſhburst,</hi> (a Gentleman whom <hi>New England</hi> can never ſufficiently Requite) is, <hi>Your ſelf, and all Perſons may Judge; how far the Vote of this Houſe doth extend to the Vindicating his Excellency from being a Countenancer of Trade with the Queen's Enemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have already intimated, how the Governour comes to have ſo many Friends in the Houſe; that are ſo ſet upon doing him Juſtice, right or wrong. Beſides the Careſſes of the Table, which are enough to dazzle an Honeſt Countryman, who thinks every Body Means what he Speaks; the Influence which Preferments and Commiſſions have upon little Men, is innexpreſſible. It muſt needs be a Mortal Sin, to diſoblidge a Governour, that has enabled a Man to command a <hi>whole Country Town,</hi> and to ſtrut among his Neighbours, with the Illuſtrious Titles of, <hi>Our Major,</hi> and <hi>The Captain,</hi> or <hi>His Worſhip.</hi> Such magnificent Grandeurs make many to ſtagger Egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly! If it be but propoſed in the Aſſembly, that any Miſmanagements of the Governour be Enquired into, we are informed, that ſome of thoſe Officers have been ſo inſolent, as to move, <hi>That he who made the Propoſal ſhould be ſet in the Pillory.</hi> We perceive, the well-affected part of the Aſſembly take much Notice of this. And it ſeems, there was in this Aſſembly, one Occaſion Odder than the reſt, to take Notice of it.</p>
               <p>There was a Pepreſentative of <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> who formerly failing in with the Intereſts of the Country, ſo provoked Col. <hi>Dudley,</hi> that in a Printed Pamphlet, publiſhed by him, (or the Perſon who wrote for him, ſo as to make it He) he reproached the Country, That ſuch a Figure
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002214_0024_0FDACF0CD6DC3FC8"/>ſhould be made in the Aſſembly, by one who was then a practiſing <hi>Sow-Gelder.</hi> This practiſing <hi>Sow-Gelder,</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Dudley</hi> calls him) was a Member of this Aſſembly, and unto the Surprize of the whole Houſe, tack'd about, and went over to Col. <hi>Dudley's</hi> Intereſts; tho' 'tis not many Months ago, that we have (now in <hi>London</hi>) his Hand with others, unto an Honeſt Letter to that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Perſon, Sir <hi>Henry Aſhburſt,</hi> to ſollicit his Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to deliver the Country from a Plot againſt the Charter, and all the Courts of Juſtice in it, with a Sham Court of Chancery, (or rather of Bribery) which Gov. <hi>Dudley</hi> was then purſuing. We are told, he has (for we know not what Reaſons) a Number in the Houſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who reſign themſelves up to him, for him to do almoſt what he will with them; they follow <hi>his</hi> Dictates. The main things that have been carried in the late Aſſembly at <hi>Boſton,</hi> otherwiſe than they ſhould have been, are owing to his Dexterous Operations. Every Body ſaid, <hi>This Man has in his Eye a</hi> Bribe, <hi>as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his Apostacy.</hi> He'll certainly be made a <hi>Justice,</hi> as ſoon as his Drudgery in gaining the <hi>Vote</hi> aforeſaid, is over! It came to paſs;—As ſoon as the <hi>Sham Vote,</hi> which has abuſed the World in your Fooliſh News Letter yonder, was Gained, the Governour draws the Council in, to Conſent, unto their own Immortal Honour, that this Gentleman <hi>Sow-Gelder</hi> ſhould be made a <hi>Justice of the Peace!</hi> Fy Gentlemen, What d'ye do? — And ſo the <hi>Worſhipful</hi> of the County of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> have the practiſing <hi>Sow-Gelder</hi> aforeſaid, (it was Mr. <hi>Dudley</hi> who taught us to call him ſo!) ſit on the Bench with them. Whether the <hi>Cattel</hi> are in leſs Danger, or the <hi>People</hi> in more, ſince this Promotion, we who are Strangers to the Man, except by hearſay, know not; we ſuppoſe there never was a <hi>Sow-Gelder</hi> made a Juſtice, except in <hi>New-England,</hi> and that not till <hi>Dudley</hi> was their Governour.</p>
               <p>But, it were good Advice for the People of <hi>Ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THE Houſe of Repreſentatives then <hi>Firmly Believe, and are of Opinion,</hi> That their Governour was not Concerned in Trading with <hi>Vetch, Borland,</hi> and <hi>Lawſon.</hi> Others do Firmly Believe the contrary. Becauſe, divers Traders have own'd, and ſaid before many Witneſſes, that their Governour did know, and allow of what they did; <hi>Vetch</hi> doth himſelf Confeſs it, in his Petition to the Queen. And when one of them ſwears in the Governour's Vindication, he only means, that the Gov. was not concern'd as a Merchant or Partner with them. He Ship'd nothing; there was nothing Ship'd on his Account. All this is nothing to the Purpoſe. And tho' Col. <hi>Dudley</hi> ſhould be Clear of having any thing to do with theſe Three Grateful Merchants, yet there is another who is able to make diſcoveries.</p>
               <p>In the ſame Condemnation with the Three aforeſaid, there was at this Time, under Impriſonment, by Vertue of the Sentence which the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> had illegally, (and it now appears Oppreſſively) paſſed upon him, for a part in an unlawful Trade, one Captain <hi>Rouſe.</hi> The laſt General Aſſembly growing ſenſible of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, Voted his being let out upon Bail, that he might enjoy his Liberty. But for a Reaſon, which he will tell in due Time, the Vote was in a great Meaſure Eluded.</p>
               <p>It is Reported by ſome now in <hi>London.</hi> That the Aſſembly's Vote to ſet <hi>Rouſe</hi> at Liberty, was made very Inſignificant, by the means of one ſaid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We hear that they have ſung the <hi>Gloria Patri</hi> in their Colledge-Hall already, and that ſeveral of their Clergy ſtood up at it. An Auſpicious beginning under their Lawyer Preſident, who, we alſo hear, was Choſen a Lieutenant of their Artillery Company at <hi>Boston,</hi> the laſt Summer. Such Reports as theſe, make their Friends here, think that the People in <hi>New-England</hi> are running Mad.</p>
               <p>But to proceed with Capt. <hi>Rouſe.</hi> Several of his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are come to <hi>London,</hi> by which we Underſtand,
<q>That he having been ſent unto <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> on a Service for the Publick, in which he did Good Service, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Home under a Languiſhing Sickneſs. A way being by this firſt Voyage open'd for a Private Trade between <hi>Port-Royal</hi> and <hi>Boston,</hi> he was Invited into a new Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Voyage; being told, <hi>He had Eaten the Sowre, he ſhould now eat the Sweet.</hi> Governour <hi>Dudley</hi> told him, <hi>His main Buſineſs was to Steer clear of the Officers of the Cuſtom-Houſe.</hi> And the matter was propoſed ſo Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageouſly, that <hi>ſome Body</hi> preſſed him to make the Governour a Preſent of an Hundred Pounds, for the Liberty and Advantage which was to be allow'd him. Becauſe he lay Sick, he <hi>had</hi> nothing, and <hi>ſaw</hi> nothing aboard, but what had been Ship'd by others Concerned in the Voyage. He went and made the beſt of his Goods; and for <hi>this,</hi> and nothing but <hi>this,</hi> he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went a Fine of <hi>Twelve Hundred Pounds.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Divers Perſons, and eſpecially a certain Lady, came to him ſeveral times in the Priſon, before his Tryal; and this as from the Governour, to perſwade him and the reſt, to Petition the Aſſembly to take the <hi>Tryal</hi> into their own Hands; (which the Governour had himſelf pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed unto the Aſſembly) with many fair Promiſes, that in a Week's time, or very quickly, the Governour would ſo manage the Aſſembly, as to bring them abroad again, without any further Trouble. Continual Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:002214_0027_0FDACF1152C14500"/>paſſed between <hi>Roxbury</hi> and the Priſon; and thoſe good Offices were done, for which <hi>Paul Dudley,</hi> the Governour's Son, received of <hi>Borland</hi> and <hi>Lawſon</hi> (as they have affirmed) at one time, a Preſent of <hi>Eighteen Pounds.</hi> They came with frequent Meſſages, to keep Captain <hi>Rouſe</hi> in a good, pliant, ſilent Humour, and prevent his telling of Tales. Juſt before his Trial, a Meſſenger came from the Governour to him, to Deſire him, <hi>That if the Governour ſhould ſay any Sharp Things to him, he would not Retort any thing, or Miſconstrue it; for he might aſſure himſelf he was his hearty Friend.</hi> He would carry on the General Aſſembly as far as was Convenient, but then, at laſt, bring off the Matter, and prevent their doing any Harm. Capt. <hi>Rouſe</hi> according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept Counſel; the Tryal went on, and the Fine anon, proves as we told ye, <hi>Twelve Hundred Pounds.</hi> The Governour's Son, could not demand of <hi>Rouſe,</hi> as he did of <hi>Cauphin,</hi> a Preſent of Twenty Pounds to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, for bringing his Fine ſo low.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>After this, Capt. <hi>Rouſe</hi> is frequently Sollicited to make the Governour a Preſent of <hi>Five or Six Hundred Pounds;</hi> with Aſſurances, that the Governour would find a way for his Liberty, tho' he were now Impriſon'd by an Act of the Aſſembly. He ſtill Refuſed it; reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to wait for Her Majeſty's Diſſallowance of that Illegal Act. He wrote Letters to the Governour, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating him to procure a Mittigation of his Hard Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, becauſe he had done nothing, but with Countenance from his <hi>Excellency.</hi> The Governour told the Meſſenger, that <hi>Rouſe</hi> muſt Write another Sort of Letter to him; which the Meſſenger Explained, with telling him, that he muſt Write, <hi>That the Governour had no Concern with what was done.</hi> But this he would never do. We hear that he continues Waiting for an Opportunity, to bring more fully to Light, many other things, beſides thoſe that have been Mentioned.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe being the main Strokes of what Captain <hi>Rouſe</hi> has thought ſit as yet to Declare of his Caſe; we don't Wonder that the Practiſing <hi>Sow-Gelder</hi> thought fit to
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:002214_0028_0FDACF12D42A1C00"/>Caſtrate the Vindicating Vote of <hi>Rouſe</hi>'s Name: But we may well Wonder, that the Houſe would be drawn into a Vote, that was deſign'd for a Blind, and a Sham, to Impoſe on People at a Diſtance; and yet, at ſuch a Diſtance as we are, we can ſee through it! At the ſame time, the Counſellors and Repreſentavies, even the moſt Ancient <hi>Blanchers</hi> among them, would (as we are aſſured) freely ſay to the Expoſtulators of their Conduct, which they every where met withal, <hi>That if the Governour had put them upon clearing him from groſs Briberies and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, they could not have cleared him.</hi> Well, but why dont they ſearch into thoſe things? For they have a Tendency to Debauch and Ruine the Country, and make it a vile, and a Forlorn Country. We are told, their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is, 'Tis <hi>too Big a Thing</hi> for them to Manage: They Wiſh the Queen would grant a <hi>Commiſſion of Enquiry.</hi> And People have been afraid to tell what they know; for the Governour and his Son, between them, have (thought they) Numberleſs Ways to come up with 'em, and, it may be, they will Preſs their Sons to the <hi>Caſtle,</hi> or elſewhere; from whence they ſhall be ſold unto Merchant Ships, and ſent out of the Country. Or, they may ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have ſome Cauſe in Court, where the Queen's Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney (the Governour's Son) Reigns <hi>Lord and King;</hi> and will take Effectual Care that the Cauſe go againſt them. Others go on, <hi>That theſe are little things; they do ſo in</hi> England; <hi>ſuch things muſt be born with!</hi> Which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, a Cruel Reproach to the Queens Government. And laſtly, the Sharpeſt of all will tell ye, <hi>Oh! the Governour is our Father; we muſt not be ſuch Sons of</hi> Cham, <hi>as to uncover the nakedneſs of our Father.</hi> And thus until the New Governour arrive, who being a Man of Integrity, will Honour himſelf by a Strict Enquiry into ſuch things, there is like to be no Diſtinct Account brought in to Infor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Before we we proceed to give an Account of the late Shameful Expedition of the <hi>New-Englanders</hi> againſt <hi>Port Royal,</hi> we ſhall take ſome farther Notice of what Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen worthy of Credit do aſſure us. One writes, that a Gentleman in <hi>New-England,</hi> when he firſt heard, that Col. <hi>Dudley</hi> had obtained a Commiſſion to be Governour there, ſaid, <hi>That he could not believe, that a Man who had been a Traytor to his Country; and an Apoſtate from the Religion in which he had been Educated, and had Murder'd two Men at</hi> New-York, <hi>better, and more Righteous than himſelf, would prove a good Governour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another Letter ſays, That the Miſery of that People
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:002214_0032_0FDACF18D375DF60"/>of late, has been in their <hi>Councellors,</hi> as well (tho' not ſo much) as in their Governour. The Priviledges which they enjoy by their preſent <hi>Charter,</hi> are Great and Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: For, no Man, but ſuch as the People ſhall nominate by their Repreſentatives, can be of the Governour's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. Nor, may there be any <hi>Judge,</hi> or <hi>Juſtice of the Peace,</hi> but what the Council thus choſen by the Repreſentatives of the People ſhall Conſent unto. So that they may, and ought to be <hi>Shields</hi> unto the People, by keeping ill Men from being in Places of Power. Yet we hear, that their Governour has made a Number of very unfit Men to be their <hi>Juſtices;</hi> and this with the Conſent of his Council, without which he could make none. So that it ſeems, theſe Great Priviledges ſignify but very little, thro' the Buſillanimity, and Unfaithfulneſs of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour's <hi>Counſellors,</hi> who will, too many of them, conſent to almoſt any thing that he would have them. Witneſs, beſides the things already mentioned, among other innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Inſtances, ſo many of them conſenting to have a Fort built at <hi>Pemaquid,</hi> and a ſtated Salary ſettled upon the Governour, and other Officers, by which they had like to have enſlaved their Country at once.</p>
               <p>The Repreſentatives are alſo to be blamed, in that they do not <hi>Change their Counſellors.</hi> We know that they want Men fit for Government. Nevertheleſs, we doubt not but in the large Province of <hi>Maſſachuſett's,</hi> there may be found an Hundred Men, as fit for Counſellors, as <hi>S. S.</hi> or <hi>J. C.</hi> or <hi>P. T.</hi> [we deal more tenderly with them, in giving but the Firſt Letters of their Names, than they have dealt with the Honourable <hi>Nathanael Higginſon,</hi> whom they have, by Name at large vilified, as a <hi>Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and Wicked Accuſer.</hi>] And others, who by their Obſequiouſneſs to <hi>Dudley</hi> have juſtly forfeited the Love of the People.</p>
               <p>Had their Repreſentative the Wiſdom frequently to Change their Counſellors, it would make them more Careful to ſtudy the Intereſt of their People, and not that ſo they may pleaſe their Governour, and Stigmatize better Men than themſelves, in their <hi>Boston</hi> News Letter, only becauſe they <hi>Slandered</hi> Dudley <hi>in a Matter of Truth.</hi>

We have pretty <hi>Broad Hints</hi> of an <hi>Unlawful Trade</hi> carried on with the Fort at <hi>Port-Royal.</hi> And beſides the things already mentioned, it is well known, that
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:002214_0034_0FDACF1BD57A13D0"/>
                  <hi>Flags of Truce</hi> paſſed between <hi>Port-Royal</hi> and <hi>Boſton,</hi> the Officers of the Cuſtom-Houſe at <hi>Boſton,</hi> were Obſtructed from going aboard thoſe Flags of Truce, that ſo the Trade carried on with the Enemy, might be Concealed. And when Goods have been Siezed on Board the Flags of Truce, they have been again taken out of the Hands of the Officers. But we muſt now proceed to a Sadder Story. The Short of the Story is this. But the <hi>Dark Deſigns</hi> muſt be left for another Judgment.</p>
               <p>When the War firſt broke out, the People of <hi>New-England,</hi> eſpecially the Trading part of the Country, and thoſe that were more immediately concern'd in the Fiſhery, were very Uneaſy to ſee <hi>Port Royal,</hi> which was then of no conſiderable Strength, advancing into a Capacity of Diſtreſſing, if not ruining the Province. It is ſo near, and ſo ſeated, as to have all immaginable Advantage to Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and Supply the <hi>Indians,</hi> by <hi>Land;</hi> and by <hi>Sea,</hi> with <hi>Privateers,</hi> to Deſtroy their Fiſhery, and Ruin all their other Trade, by intercepting, and taking their Veſſels, both Outward and Inward Bound. Their <hi>Fort</hi> was but an <hi>Embryo,</hi> and it was thought they might have been eaſily Suppreſſed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>New-Englanders</hi> underſtood by a <hi>Port-Royaller</hi> fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into their Hands, that at <hi>Port-Royal</hi> they had not yet Heard of the War broken out. Whereupon Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <hi>Dudley</hi> was earneſtly Sollicited, and his Leave In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated by ſome, to go and Deſtroy that Neſt of <hi>Hornets,</hi> which was like to be ſo grievous a growing Plague to the Country; with Offers to raiſe Volunteers ſufficient for that Purpoſe; But the Propoſal was rejected; which made People ſuſpect ſome <hi>Dark Deſigns,</hi> and that <hi>Port-Royal</hi> was reſerved for ſome ſpecial Advantages not Obvious to the Vulgar.</p>
               <p>Afterwards, when the Governour could no longer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Cry of the Country, Col. <hi>Church</hi> was allow'd to go. The Aſſembly procured a Mortar Piece, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Bombs, and other things convenient, and had ſome Eye upon the Fort, which was then finiſh'd. Yet the ſaid <hi>Church</hi> not only had the Taking of the <hi>Fort</hi> left out
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:002214_0035_0FDACF1D53539DD8"/>of his Orders, but was poſitively <hi>Forbidden</hi> to Meddle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it. And he hath ſince affirm'd to many Gentlemen, that he could with all the Eaſe imaginable have Taken the Fort, but that he had been ſo ſtrictly and menacingly <hi>Forbidden</hi> to meddle with it, that he durſt not; but only ravaged the Naked Country. <hi>Church</hi>'s Soldiers were all <hi>Volunteers,</hi> and an <hi>Ast of the Aſſembly</hi> had promiſed them a certain Share of the Plunder: But the Chief Commanders firſt made a large Preſent out of it to the Governour; and then <hi>Hs,</hi> joyning with them, cut off the Army of Half that the <hi>Publick Faith</hi> had Engaged them; which it was feared, would have proved a laſting Diſcouragement to all <hi>Volunteers</hi> for the Service of the Crown and the Country: And the Houſe of Repreſentatives Remonſtrated unto the Governour, this among other Grievances; but were rejected with Obſtinate Contempt.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon pretended by the Governour, for prohibiting <hi>Church's</hi> meddling with the Fort, was, <hi>That he had laid the Matter before the Queen, and had yet received no Orders about it.</hi> Tho' the ſame Objection ſtill continued, yet the People being extreamly deſirous that a Period might be put to their Miſeries from <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> and a way open'd for the Deliverance of ſo many Scores of poor <hi>Engliſh</hi> Captives, likely to Languiſh for ever in the <hi>Indian Wigwams,</hi> moved for another Expedition above a Year ago. The Governour now gives a Commiſſion for Taking the Fort; but whether with any <hi>Dark Deſigns,</hi> we are yet <hi>in the Dark.</hi> After the Inſtructions were drawn up, there was a Clauſe Tack'd at the End of them, which gave the Army leave to come off when they would, if they ſhould imagine, they could not preſently Finiſh their Buſineſs to their Minds. It was the Tacking this unobſerved Clauſe at laſt, that confounded all, and brought on a Story, which all the Letters from <hi>New-England</hi> we have yet ſeen, ſay, <hi>They Bluſh to Write it.</hi> And that is the Reaſon why we can give but a Short Account of it. In ſhort, there was an Army of as likely Men as can be imagined, the beſt part of Two Thouſand of them; and as well provided with Ammunition, Proviſion, and all things
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:002214_0036_0FDACF1ED2870EA8"/>Neceſſary, as a Willing Country could afford. But, when it comes to Execution, quite Contrary to the beſt Advice of them who knew the Place, the landed ſeveral Mil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

However, Land they did; and Drove the Enemy before them, and Chaſed them into the Fort with much Courage, and all the Encouragement that could be.

               <p>The Governour's Youngeſt Son, <hi>William Dudley,</hi> was there too, in the Quality of a Secretary of War; and tho' he were little more than a <hi>Boy,</hi> yet he was a <hi>Son,</hi> and the Army ſoon Cry'd out of being <hi>Boy-ridden.</hi> The General, a Man of no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, having Signaliz'd ſomething of a <hi>Belluine</hi> Courage in ſome <hi>Indian</hi> Encounters, the <hi>Mob</hi> ('tis ſaid) was ſet upon having him to be a Commander. They landed as we ſaid; but then they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made a <hi>Formal Demand</hi> of the Fort; they never carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore a <hi>Mortar</hi> or a <hi>Field Piece;</hi> they never threw up a <hi>Shovel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> of Earth. The Buſineſs was ſo managed, between certain Perſons, that altho' at a <hi>Council of War,</hi> one Day it was Voted. That the <hi>Fort</hi> ſhould be attack'd, it was by'nd by, Unvoted again. The Engineer had wrought upon ſundry Captains, to make 'em Believe, <hi>That the taking of the Fort was Impracticable.</hi> They moſt of them gave it under their Hands to their Wiſe General, <hi>That it was their Opinion, it was beſt for them to Draw off.</hi> The Soldiers began alſo to be Diſpirited, for ſome had Blabb'd among them a Secret, which, when it came to be known, made them out of their Witts. Tho' it was known and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed here in <hi>London,</hi> before the Fleet was Returned from <hi>Port-Royal.</hi> The General Aſſembly had Agreed and Engaged, That if the Fort were taken, it ſhould immediately be Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed; and without this Aſſurance the Army would never have proceeded.

But in three or Four Days after the ſailing of the Packet, and before it was Poſſible for them to hear from <hi>Boſton,</hi> they drew off in great Confuſion, and Weigh'd Anchor, and came away. But as they were in the midſt of their Diſperſion, there came Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to ſtop as many of them, as were together at <hi>Caſco-Bay.</hi> From thence they ſent three Perſons to acquaint the Governour with the Miſerable Affair; whereof one was the <hi>Engineer</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. They had a very melancholly, and almoſt a tumultuous Reception by the People; and when they were, at their firſt Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upbraided with Cowardice, their Anſwer ſtill was, <hi>That the Fault was at Home; and they had gone as far as their Orders would bear them out;</hi> with ſundry ſuch Reflections, which bore hard upon the Government. The Council were informed of this Diſcourſe; But there was no Notice taken of it. And tho' they were Chidden by the Governour, in the Council Chamber, yet we underſtand, they were Hugg'd and Careſs'd by him below Stairs, to the great Scandal of the People. The People were now in a mighty Ferment. It was the Univerſal Opinion, that if the Army had only ſtaid, and Play'd at <hi>Coits</hi> in their Camp (far enough from the Fort) at <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> the Fort would have been within a few Days ſurrendred to them. The Soldiers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were Mutinous to the laſt Degree; Deſerters daily came over. Proviſions would have grown Scanty in a little Time. [Tho' the Lodgings of their Men were not now thatch'd; (the Reaſon why we told you before) yet a red-hot Bullet or two ſlung into the Fort, might have ſet them all on Fire.] Ten thouſand things might have happened. But, like Men afraid of having the Fort fall into their Hands, they ran back to <hi>New-England</hi> as faſt as their <hi>Canyas</hi> Sails could carry them.</p>
               <p>The Good <hi>Women</hi> in <hi>Boſton,</hi> could not forbear their Out-cries, when they met in the Streets, on this Occaſion.

The Way pitch'd upon was, to make a Pretended <hi>Court-Martial,</hi> to Enquire into the Cauſe of the Miſmanage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at <hi>Port-Royal.</hi> This Court was the Ridicule of Town and Country. No Body was Try'd at it, or ſo much as Accuſed. All was carried on in <hi>Hugger-Mugger.</hi> We can Hear of Nothing done; but the Preſenting of the Secretary of War, <hi>Will. Dudley,</hi> with all the Plunder that was taken, and amounted to between One and Two Hundred Pounds, and then leave to go Home! It is plain, the General was not to be Impeached there; 'tis well, if it has not Ruined the Governour, as well as the Diſtreſſed Country, yet we hear the Governour, before the Sitting of the ſaid Court, gave him an Order for an Advantagious Poſt at the <hi>Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> to Build a Fort at <hi>Saco,</hi> becauſe he would not Take one at <hi>Port-Royal;</hi> as High and rich a Poſt, as he was ever capable of.</p>
               <p>And ſo much for <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> until the <hi>Dark Deſigns</hi> come into further Light. And then it will be known whether Governour <hi>Dudley</hi> when he ſaw the Country was Violently ſet upon going, and ſo Interrupting his Trade with the <hi>French,</hi> had not a Secret De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, that the Fort at <hi>Port-Royal</hi> ſhould have been made (as the Fort at <hi>Pemaquid</hi> would have been) a Convenient Place for the <hi>Fur-Trade</hi> with the <hi>Indians,</hi> whereby himſelf, and ſome Friends of his here, in <hi>Britain,</hi> would have got no little Riches. In the mean time, under his Admirable Conduct, an Impoveriſh'd Country has, (as we are credibly informed) been put to above Two and Twenty Thouſand Pounds Charge, only to be Laughed at by their Enemies, and Pitied by their Friends.</p>
