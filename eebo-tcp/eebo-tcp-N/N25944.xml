            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE <hi>HISTORY</hi> OF THE DAVENPORT FAMILY.</head>
            <p>IN the North of England lived a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and lady of the name of Davenport; they had two boys and two girls. Mrs. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venport took care herſelf of the education of her daughters, whilſt her huſband attended to that of the boys. Theſe children were very good and dutiful to their parents; and, indeed, it would have been a ſhame had they been otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Their names were,

            </p>
            <p>Though their houſe was ſeveral miles diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant from any town, yet it had the advantage of a very good neighborhood; this, however, did not laſt all the year, as moſt of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies who lived thereabout, ſpent the winter in London: yet, during this dreary ſeaſon, our little family wiſhed not for more ſociety than was to be found under their own roof; they were always happy and cheerful within themſelves. Mrs. Davenport had a brother, who was a widower, with two daughters: Sophia and Amelia Eaſy. Having occaſion to viſit the continent, he begged the favor of his brother and ſiſter to take care of them during their abſence from ſchool at Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas. This requeſt was readily complied with; and, accordingly, when the holidays were nearly arrived, Mr. Davenport ſet off for London, to convey theſe young ladies from thence down to his own houſe. Mary and Caroline expected the arrival of their couſins
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:034505_0005_0FFE09BD27245320"/>with a deal of pleaſure. During the week that Mr. Davenport was abſent, their leiſure hours were employed in making up new clothes for their dolls, and getting all their playthings in order. At length, the happy day arrived, their papa returned, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced Sophia and Amelia to them; hoping that they would be good friends, and love one another as ſiſters.</p>
            <p>Sophia Eaſy was fourteen years old, Amelia was twelve. They had the misfortune to loſe their mother when they were very young, and having been from that time brought up at one of the firſt ſchools, great attention had been paid to their French, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic, and other accompliſhments, but they were girls of very perverſe and wayward diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions. Sophia was very proud and unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to take any advice, haughty to ſervants, and impertinent to her ſuperiors; at ſchool ſhe had connected herſelf with a ſet of thoſe ſilly girls who laughed at every one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>diculous ſchemes. Amelia was vain and conceited; ſhe never let ſlip an opportunity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> admiring herſelf in a looking glaſs, and, had the time been allowed her, would with pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure have ſpent the whole morning at her toi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let. Beſides theſe foibles, they had each of them contracted a habit of telling falſehoods. Such were the Miſs Eaſys, and from what I have ſaid of the little Davenports, my young readers will readily ſuppoſe that they were not much pleaſed with their viſitors.</p>
            <p>Mr. Davenport read ſhort prayers to the whole family every night, which were always over by nine o'clock, when the children went to bed. They roſe at ſix in ſummer, and at eight in winter; though uſed to earlier hours at ſchool, Sophia and Amelia did not chuſe to get out of bed till paſt eleven. Mrs. Davenport took no notice of this the firſt morning, thinking that the journey had fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued them; but the next day when the clock ſtruck eleven, and they had not made their appearance, ſhe went up ſtairs and gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproved them, adding, that ſhe hoped

"This is a very late hour for breakfaſt," ſaid Mrs. Davenport, as they entered the room; we are a regular family, and it muſt not "happen again." "What," ſaid Sophia, "are we to get up by <hi>four?</hi>" "I did not ſay <hi>four,</hi>" replied Mrs. Davenport, rather diſpleaſed at her pertneſs; "but nine is our breakfaſt hour, and thoſe who are not down by that tim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

"Study, do you call it?" ſaid Mary; "well you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine how we all like it, for papa teaches us; and we find it very entertaining; however, if you do not like it, we will find out ſome other amuſement; will you go up ſtairs and play with our dolls?"

<pb n="15" facs="unknown:034505_0015_0FFE09C9CD216788"/>every thing that was proper; but he, like a fooliſh boy, would never take their advice. His papa one day bought a horſe that was rather unruly, and ſtrictly charged his groom never to let Harry ride it. Harry, however, ſoon found an opportunity for ſo doing; for one day when his papa was out, he went into the ſtables, and finding no groom there, he quickly ſaddled the horſe, and was juſt preparing to mount, when his father returned. "What are you doing there, Sir?" ſaid he.—"Only going to ride Crop, papa."—"Then," replied Mr. Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong, "you are <hi>only</hi> going to do what I have expreſsly forbid; ſo pray put off your ride for the preſent; go into the houſe, and let me not ſee your face again to day." The next morning, at breakfaſt, Mr. Headſtrong was ſo good as not to take any notice of what had happened the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding day: but this indulgence, far from having the proper effect, only ſerved to make Harry worſe. His father and mother being obliged to go on a viſit for ſome days, where they could not conveniently take him with
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:034505_0016_0FFE0988301839B0"/>them, Mr. Headſtrong, before his departure, gave him ſome very good advice, and above all, deſired him upon no account to get upon Crop's back. Harry aſſured him he would not, but no ſooner was his father gone, than he went to Dick the groom, and contrived to ſend him out of the way upon ſome meſſage or other. In the mean time, he mounted Crop, and the moment he was out of the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble yard, ſet off on a gallop. When he had got about a quarter of a mile from the houſe, he wiſhed to turn back again, but he checked the bridle in vain—<hi>on</hi> Crop went, with ſuch impetuoſity, that Harry could no longer keep his ſeat.</p>
                        <p>Luckily, however, before he quite loſt it, he had time to diſengage his feet from the ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rups, otherwiſe he muſt have been dragged a conſiderable way; which circumſtance would, moſt likely, have proved fatal to him, as the road was very uneven and flinty. His fall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived him of his ſenſes, and he lay ſome time on the ground before any one paſſed by. At laſt a countryman came that way, and placing
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:034505_0017_0FFE09CC95BB89A0"/>him upon ſome hay in his cart, carried him to his own cottage. As ſoon as his wife ſaw Harry, "Good lack a day!" quoth ſhe, "if this is not 'ſquire Headſtrong's own ſon and heir! goodneſs me! if he ſhould die!—do, there's a good man," ſaid ſhe to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, "take Ball, and ride to tow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Tomkin thought Joan's advice was good, ſo getting on Ball, he trotted away to the next town. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his abſence, Harry came to himſelf, but was ſo bruiſed, that he could not move. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Joan was a good ſort of a woman enough, but was rather inquiſitive, and not a little talkative. She make Harry relate the whole adventure, and interrupted him every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with ſome remark or other. At laſt, when he had finiſhed, ſhe exclaimed, <q>Good gemini! how could you be ſo ventureſome!

"Oh," ſays Joan, <q>you muſt not be in ſuch low ſpirits neither.</q> She then ran out of the room, and quickly returned with a cup of elder wine made hot with ſpices. It was lucky for Harry that the ſurgeon arrived juſt time enough to prevent the doſe, for had he taken it, it would have increaſed his fever much, which was already at an alarming height. Mr. Hopkin ſaid, that none of his bones were broke, but gave it as his opinion, that he ought to be removed to his father's houſe. This was agreed to, and for three weeks he kept his bed, dangerouſly ill. When his father and mother heard of the misfortune, they haſtened back; ſo that, inſtead of ſtaying from home a fortnight, as they had originally intended, they were abſent but one day.</p>

<pb n="19" facs="unknown:034505_0019_0FFE09CF60157C58"/>as bad as ever. At laſt he grew ſo miſchievous, that no gentlemen would ſuffer their ſons to keep company with him, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they ſhould follow his bad example. His father kept piſtols in his bed chamber, and they were generally lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

One day, however, when Mr. and Mrs. Headſtrong, were gone out to dinner, he ſtole in unperceived by the ſervants, and getting one of them down, he pulled the trigger and diſcharged it. Unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily the piſtol had not been looked at for ſome time, and was in ſo bad a condition that it burſt. The conſequence was, that his hand was ſhattered in ſo terrible a manner that he was forced to have it cut off. The excrutiat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pain he then underwent, made him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect ſeriouſly on his diſobedience. Oh! (thought he to himſelf) if I had but minded what my father ſaid to me, I ſhould never have ſuffered thus! In fine, this laſt accident
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:034505_0020_0FFE09905FF23CE8"/>had ſo good an effect upon him, that for the future he did every thing his parents deſired him to do, and conſequently became a very good boy.</p>

This lady, being deſirous of making the holidays of Sophia and Amelia paſs as pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly as poſſible, invited ſome young people, intending to have a dance, and Harry Lively's father was prevailed upon to let him ſtay at Mr. Davenport's till it was over.

It to theſe we add Harry Lively, the Dav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enport, and their couſins, we ſhall find juſt enough to make nine couple. They began dancing at ſix o'clock, and would willingly have continued their ſport till midnight, if Mrs. Davenport had thought proper; but that lady judged ten a better hour for ſupper, as none of them were above fourteen years old. Though the ball had been purpoſely made for the entertainment of Sophia and her ſiſter, they were ſo ungrateful as to pout, and give themſelves airs, becauſe they could not dance any longer. Mrs. Davenport, however, choſe to be obeyed, and all but her neices went to bed in perfect good humour. The next day there arrived a packet of letters from France. Mr. Eaſy's letter to his eldeſt daughter was as follows:</p>

            <p>Though Sophia and Amelia were very glad to hear from their father, they were not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together pleaſed to find that he differed from them in thinking that they were to pay obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Mrs. Davenport. They were ſo fooliſh as to imagine that ſhe only reproved them for the ſake of finding fault, and were inwardly determined to pay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> more atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to her than they had hitherto done. They kept their reſolution; and though Mrs. Dav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enport was always propoſing ſome party of
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:034505_0029_0FFE09DDD11A0188"/>pleaſure for them, they took no pains to pleaſe her in return.</p>
            <p>As to their getting up early in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though their aunt was continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting to them how unwholeſome it is to ſpend ſo many hours in bed, they did not heed her, till Mrs. Davenport put her threat in execution of letting them go without their beakfaſt, if they were not down by nine o'clock. She was ſorry to be obliged to have recourſe to ſo harſh a method, but finding that a milder one had no effect upon them, thought it her duty to do all ſhe could, to make them follow a cuſtom ſo beneficial to their health. Twelfth Night now came on, and Mrs. Davenport, ſtill indulgent, again invited the young people who were at the dance. Her own maid ſupplied the place of a paſtry-cook, and inſtead of ſugar figures, which generally conſtitute the prizes on this occaſion, Mr. Davenport made up ſeveral parcels containing toys, &amp;c. with names pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon them to anſwer to thoſe which they

            <p>The young people were all much pleaſed with their preſents, and ſpent the evening very happily in examining them and playing at different games till their ſeparate carriages arrived. The next morning Mrs. Daven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port took her nieces and daughters to the cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages in the neighborhood, which ſhe had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways made a practice of doing, wiſhing to ſee herſelf how the poor people fared, and to relieve their poverty as much as lay in her power. They were rejoiced to ſee her, for they all loved and reſpected her greatly, as
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:034505_0032_0FFE099FF1BEAE20"/>ſhe never quitted them without leaving marks of her bounty behind her. It was not for theſe viſits alone that they were indebted to her, for ſhe frequently <hi>ſent</hi> them clothes, butcher's meat, &amp;c. &amp;c. and in winter they came every other day for ſoup, which Mrs. Davenport cauſed her ſervants to diſtribute in quantities according to the number of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent families. Mary and Caroline, too, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten begged of their mama to let them make ſome clothes for the younger children, which requeſt Mrs. Davenport was ever ready to agree to; and ſuch great pleaſure did they find in this employment, that when they had done any thing worthy of a reward, Mrs. Davenport gave them m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>erials for making a petticoat, gown, &amp;c. for ſome little peaſant girl or other. Mary was this day provided with a gown for Madge, their late gardener's daughter, and Caroline with a petticoat; as they had obſerved, the laſt time they paid the little girl a viſit, that ſhe was in great want of both theſe articles. Now, as I think it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry likely that my young readers wiſh to know
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:034505_0033_0FFE09E3D98FF200"/>how Mary and Caroline had purchaſed this indulgence, I ſhall inform them, that they had been particularly attentive to their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent exerciſes for a month paſt, and this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention their kind mama never failed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>When they had all ſtepped into the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, the ſervant put in a bundle containing little Madge's gown and petticoat. "What's this," ſaid Sophia; "what are you put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this in for?"—"Oh," ſays Caroline, that bundle belongs to me and my ſiſter; it muſt not be left behind upon any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count"—<hi>"Indeed but it ſhall,"</hi> returned So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, "if it is to be placed againſt my feet in this manner."—"Well then." ſaid Caroline, I will take it up in my lap; pray don't quarrel about it." "Pray, miſs Caroline," ſaid Amelia (who ſat upon the ſame ſide), "don't think I'll permit the naſty bundle to crowd <hi>me</hi> up; is not the coach full enough already, without <hi>bundles?</hi>" Mrs. Davenport caſt an angry look at her nieces,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:034505_0034_0FFE09A2D5070A98"/>and without ſaying any thing to them, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed "the poſtillions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>

Ah! your brother Henry, he uſed to love me dearly—I remember he had a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle garden of his own—I marked it out for him—a pretty little fellow he was, with his little roſy cheeks and hazle eyes; I think I ſee him now running towards me, with his brown hair blowing about; "Here Joſeph, Joſeph," cried he, "my papa has been ſo kind, he has given me leave to have a piece of ground to <hi>myſelf,</hi> if <hi>you</hi> will give it me, in one of the kitchen gardens, or any where you pleaſe out of ſight; for my papa ſays, he ſuppoſes I ſhall make fine work of it; and as you like to keep the pleaſure-arounds ſo neat, he thought you would not wiſh me to have it thereabouts." Then away we both trotted as faſt as we could, <hi>he</hi> pulling along. When we got to the place, I marked out the ground, and weeded it for him. "Now," ſays he, "you muſt, dear Joſeph, give me ſome flower roots, for I ſhould

            <p>Mrs. Davenport made the old man very happy, by informing him that ſhe expected her brother every week: Joſeph had not ſeen him for near four years; for when Mr. Eaſy was laſt at Thorne Park, he (the old man) was gone into Wales, to tranſact ſome buſineſs for his landlord, Mr. Davenport. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia and Amelia liſtened with great atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the above account of their father, and when their annt reminded them, that ſhe had other cottages to viſit, took their leave with ſome reluctance.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Davenport, upon quitting the houſe, inquired of Joan, whether there was any thing they wanted; adding that till ſhe had an opportunity of calling again, ſhe ſhould

Joſeph's wife returned her many thanks, ſaid, they wanted nothing at preſent, and that if Mr. Eaſy would honor them with a viſit, it would give great pleaſure to her poor huſband; but, as the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe might be too much for him in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent weak ſtate, begged of Mrs. Davenport to let them know an hour or two beforehand.

<pb n="52" facs="unknown:034505_0052_0FFDC67F1847A708"/>the young ladies will walk in, there is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good fire, and the room is quite tidy."— Ah! that it is," cried little Doll; "for I and my ſiſter have juſt now been ſweep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and the fire is as bright as the ſun; and all comfortable againſt mother and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ſiſter Hetty come home." Mrs. Davenport ſmiled at the little girl's vivacity and taking her and the youngeſt by the hand, walked on; upon which the eldeſt cried out, "Pray, Dolly, do not go nigh the lady with thoſe <hi>dirty</hi> hands, and that <hi>dirty apron.</hi>"— "Very true," ſaid Dolly, "I quite forgot <hi>that,</hi> but I hope I have not done any harm <hi>yet,</hi> and I'll run directly to the pump and waſh my hands, and take off my apron, and be back in a trice!" and away ſhe ran. Mrs. Davenport and the reſt ſat round the fire, and the following dialogue paſſed between them.</p>

                        <p>THERE was once a poor man who had two daughters: Jenny was the eldeſt, and Martha the youngeſt. Their father was taken ill and died. On his death bed, he called them both to him, and thus addreſſed them: <q>My dear
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:034505_0056_0FFE0A02AC78E728"/>girls, you will ſoon be turned into the wide world, I have worked as much as I have been able, but all my endeavours to leave you a little money have been fruitleſs; and all I can do is to give you a little advice. You muſt both work hard for your living, as you muſt be ſenſible there is not a ſingle perſon from whom you can expect any aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. That you Jenny will be induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, I have not the leaſt doubt: I wiſh I could be as confident, Martha, with reſpect to you; but as you have always loved me tenderly, I have ſome hope that my death bed advice will not be thrown away. You will be both left to yourſelves, without a ſoul to direct you; but ſtill you may ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, if you will be but good and induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious. To be <hi>happy</hi> one muſt be <hi>good,</hi> in all ſtations of life. To thoſe who live in affluence, it is a neceſſary qualification as well as to the cottager<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In the former caſe, it directs the minds to a proper uſe of riches, it teaches the <hi>only</hi> way of enjoying
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:034505_0057_0FFE0A468E6418E8"/>them: without it, though rolling in riches, men are miſerable. How indiſpenſably neceſſary is it then to the poor; whilſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoing the ſharp pains of hunger, they have need of conſolation, and what can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford them more than a good conſcience!— never commit a bad action upon any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration whatever; though it were to procure you all the comforts and elegan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of life, you would ſtill be miſerable.

            <p>Jenny and Martha received their father's advice with heartfelt gratitude. They prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſed to follow it, and, weeping bitterly, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his bleſſing. He gave it them with great earneſtneſs, and expired.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Davenport commended Molly's read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and was making ſome remarks upon the ſtory, when Dolly returned, with intelligence that "ſhe ſpied her mother coming down the hill;" adding, "that, ſhe had been hunting

They have <hi>all</hi> been very civil to me, but this young lady (pointing to Mary) made me four nice bibs and aprons—ſo I think, miſs, I <hi>muſt</hi> give them to you (that is, if you will take them) for I know you have very fine flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers indeed at home—ſuch as I ſeldom <hi>ſee,</hi> but you look ſo ſmiling and good natured, that I am ſure—yes, I am quite ſure, you will accept them."—Mary returned the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with a kiſs, and told the little girl, that if ſhe had but drawn up the flowers by the roots, ſhe would have taken them home and planted them.—"Oh, if that's all," replied Dolly, "I can ſoon get you ſome ſnow drop roots, though they are not in flower!"—and away ſhe ran into the garden. The mother now entered the room, and teſtified her acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edgements for Mrs. Davenport's kind viſit,

I want nothing at preſent, for I and my daughter have had plenty of good work lately, which (with my huſband's and ſon's wages) has brought us in a good deal. I have now nine ſhillings and ſixpence by me, which will laſt ſome time; and I have a proſpect of work for three weeks longer. I know your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſo well, that you will never let a family periſh for want of a little aſſiſtance: This madam is a great comfort to us all, but while we can work we will never come upon you.</p>

            <p>The little girls and their mother accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied Mrs. Davenport and the young ladies to the carriage door, and courteſyed reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully as they drove away. <q>What a charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thing is induſtry!</q> cried Mrs. Daven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, ſtill looking at the cottage; <q>thoſe poor people maintain themſelves entirely by it.

            <p>The converſation now turned upon old Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph: "I wiſh," ſaid Mary, <q>my uncle may come ſoon; not only becauſe I long to ſee him, but that his arrival will make old Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph ſo happy.</q>—"I know," returned Mrs. Davenport, <q>that the interview will be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſing to my brother; he had always a great reſpect for the old man, and regret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted much his being in Wales when he viſited us laſt."—"How affectionately the poor man ſpoke about him," cried Sophia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—that is becauſe he always treated him well,</q> ſaid Mrs. Davenport; <q>he never thought worſe of him for his poverty, he was well aſſured of his honeſty; and though ſo much his ſuperior in life, paid him as much at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention as if he had been the firſt man in the kingdom, becauſe he knew him to be a man of integrity.</q>

As ſoon as they got home, Mary put her ſnow-drop roots into ſome water, not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time to plant them immediately. Mr. Davenport had that morning received from his bookſeller at York a great many new pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lications, ſome of which were deſigned for young people. After tea, when they were all aſſembled in the library, he went to a large packing caſe, and taking out a ſmall volume, aſked the children if they had a mind to hear a fairy tale; "A fairy tale!" they all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, "Oh, pray, Sir, let us hear it."—"With all my heart," ſaid Mr. Davenport; "but then Charles muſt read it to you."—"Oh, that I will, with pleaſure," cried he; and taking the book from his father, began reading.</p>

                        <p>THE king and queen of Roſyland had an only daughter, whoſe name was Melpomene. She was extremely beautiful, but of ſo bad a temper, that no ſtranger could ſit an hour in

She perceived that this predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion gave them great pain, and in ſome meaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure to mitigate it, propoſed her own habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as a proper aſylum for Melpomene, till ſuch time as her magical books ſhould inform her that ſhe might live with her father and mother. The queen acknowledged herſelf much obliged to Benevolenta for this offer, but inwardly determined not to profit by it, as ſhe could not imagine where a daughter could be ſo well ſituated as under a father's roof. The king was of the ſame opinion with his royal conſort; he had long wiſhed for a child, and now when he had got one,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:034505_0064_0FFE0A0DE8B259A8"/>was in no great hurry to part with it. When Melpomene was a month old, the queen was carried round the city in a car made of ivory and gold, drawn by white horſes, harneſſed with white and ſilver ribbon, and led by little boys, dreſſed in white, and garlands of roſes. Four and twenty g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

She then waved her wand, and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a car appeared in the heavens, drawn by four doves; it deſcended, and mounting it, ſhe was preſently out of ſight.</p>
                        <p>Two years ſoon paſſed away: Benevolenta appeared in Roſyland, and conjured Aſteria to confide the princeſs to her care. But the queen was inexorable; neither threats or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties could prevail upon her to part with her darling. The king was equally obſtinate, and Benevolenta departed with infinite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret. Her enxiety for the fate of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and natural goodneſs of heart, prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to take a long and very dangerous journey, in order to conſult a ſuperior gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius, reſpecting the poſſibility of ſoftening the rigor of her deſtiny. From him ſhe received the following anſwer:</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>If Melpomene had quitted Roſyland at the age of TWO YEARS, her days would have been crowned with bliſs. Her ill-judging parents, by their folly, have doom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:034505_0066_0FFE0A10D116AA10"/>her to future miſery. But as our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved fairy, Benevolenta, has intereſted herſelf in the fate of the child, it is decreed that her miſery will not be ENDLESS.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The fairy was overjoyed upon hearing this decree; and immediately ſet out for Roſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Upon entering the palace, ſhe obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the attendants countenances filled with diſmay. She eagerly inquired the cauſe, and was told by one of them, that the princeſs had that morning been ſtolen away by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible hand. She was making farther inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries reſpecting the truth of this intelligence, when ſhe perceived Aſteria approaching. She appeared half diſtracted, ſtaring wildly about her, and calling upon the princeſs. Benevolenta haſtily went to meet and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace her, but the queen ſtarting back, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, <q>It is not <hi>ſhe!</hi> Why did you tell me ſhe was found! You all take pleaſure in deceiving me, but I do not care—Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenta will ſoon be here, and ſhe will tell me news of her. <hi>She</hi> will not be ſo cruel.</q>

                           <hi>Queen.</hi> YOU Benevolenta!—No, no! do not think I will believe it. Do you imagine I do not know Benevolenta when I ſee her? Benevolenta is by far more kind than you.</p>
                        <p>The fairy finding it was impoſſible to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter conſolation to the queen in her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of mind, conſigned her to the care of her domeſtics ſtrictly charging them not to loſe ſight of her for one moment. She herſelf repaired to the king's apartments, where ſhe found him in all the agonies of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. "Oh! my friend," ſaid he, <q>in what a ſituation do you find me! To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe was a child granted to my prayers, if I was to be bereft of it ſo ſoon?</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>"Stop!" cried Benevolenta, <q>when the ſuperior Powers bleſſed thee with a daughter, they conditioned that ſhe was to
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:034505_0068_0FFE0A13A096D1B8"/>quit thy roof at the age of two years, and not to return for a certain ſpace of time. You have dared to counteract their deſigns: you have been told of the conſequences that would enſue. This misfortune is but the beginning of the miſery you have prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for her. It is your own work; do not arraign the juſtice of the higher powers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you have been preſumptuous enough to draw down their anger by diſobedience to their commands.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>"Oh!" replied the king <q>do not add to my miſery by theſe juſt reproaches. I have been greatly to blame; and I now, with ſufficient weight, feel the puniſhment of my errors. But I have ſtill a ſmall ray of hope left:—From you I expect ſuccour— intercede for me, and</q>—</p>
                        <p>"It is already done," replied the fairy; <q>I have obtained from the great ALMANZO-ROASTER a promiſe, that ſhe will not <hi>always</hi> be unhappy, THAT HER MISERY WILL NOT BE ENDLESS.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="69" facs="unknown:034505_0069_0FFE0A57AA2A3C38"/>
The king, upon hearing theſe laſt words, threw himſelf at the fairy's feet, and caught hold of her robe. "Benevolenta," ſaid he; <q>you have reſtored me to life; you have laid me under eternal obligations. Then you <hi>can</hi> give me hopes of my daughter; I ſhall again have her in my arms, again embrace her! what joy!—But while I thus anticipate my delights, what may ſhe be enduring! How can I tell but what ſome evil genius has got her in his poſſeſſion— cruel thought!—Oh, Benevolenta! releaſe me from my torture—tell where ſhe is.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Theſe interrogations troubled the fairy. She well knew his conjectures were very well founded; but, fearing to increaſe his anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, totally diſcouraged them: adding, that ſhe had not the leaſt doubt but that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs would ſoon be reſtored to him and his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved conſort; and, aſſuring him of her ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt aſſiſtance, vaniſhed from his ſight, and the inſtant ſhe found herſelf in her own pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:034505_0070_0FFE0A5BB1678D70"/>ſet about preparing a charm for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of Melpomene.—</p>

            <p>The children were all liſtening with great attention, when a ſervant, who had been ſent that morning to the next poſt town, returned with a packet of letters, and it afforded no little joy to the circle to find that among the reſt there was a long one from France. The children crowded with eagerneſs round Mr. Davenport, whilſt his amiable wife, hanging on the back of his chair, ſhared in the pleaſure they all received upon being acquainted with the contents.</p>

               <q>My dear friends at Thorne Park will be very happy to hear, that, by the time they receive this, I ſhall be but a few miles from them. If the wind proves but favorable, it is moſt probable I ſhall have it in my power to embrace them on the fifteenth.</q>

            <p>"The fifteenth!" they all exclaimed, <q>why that's tomorrow! No—ſurely—is it?

            <head>THE <hi>HISTORY</hi> OF THE DAVENPORT FAMILY.</head>
            <p>THE next morning as they were ſitting at breakfaſt, they heard the ſound of a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage driving up the avenue: They all jump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up from the table, and running to the window, with one voice exclaimed, "Here "he is! Here he is!" In an inſtant the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour door flew open, and Mr. Eaſy entered. I ſhould have much to ſay, were I to repeat all that was ſaid on both ſides upon this happy meeting; thoſe who have affectionate fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, uncles, and brothers, can eaſily picture to themſelves what paſſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="unknown:034505_0076_0FFE0A1C2091C0D8"/>
Mr. Eaſy was a valuable acquiſition to this little ſociety; to a good heart, he joined an excellent underſtanding, an improved mind, and elegant manners. He and Mr. Davenport were educated at the ſame ſchool, travelled together, and their diſpoſitions being alike, they formed a friendſhip, which increaſed with their years, and which was afterwards ſtrongly cemented by the union of Mr. Eaſy's ſiſter with Mr. Davenport.</p>
            <p>Mr. Eaſy alſo married, but unfortunately loſt his wife two months after the birth of his youngeſt daughter, who, being a very ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly child, did not ſurvive her mother many weeks.</p>
            <p>Sophia and Amelia were very fond of their father, and, indeed, it would have been ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular if they had not, as he ever treated them with true paternal tenderneſs. 'Tis true, they enjoyed but little of his ſociety, as they never ſaw him, but when he paid them occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional viſits at ſchool; but then he always teſtified ſo much pleaſure in being with them, and ſo affectionately attended to all their little
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:034505_0077_0FFE0A6700D0A610"/>requeſts, that he was as dear to them as if they had always lived together.</p>
            <p>After the deſcription I formerly gave of theſe two ſiſters, the above may ſeem extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, but then my readers muſt conſider, that their diſpoſitions were ſuch as could not hear contradiction, and therefore, while Mr. Eaſy had no opportunity of thwarting their inclinations, they behaved properly towards him: but it will ſoon appear, that, from the moment he had occaſion to exert his parental authority, they were no longer the ſame af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate children.</p>
            <p>This little family had ſo many intereſting ſubjects for converſation, that when the din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner bell rang, they were quite ſurpriſed to find it ſo late. The evening ſtole off impercepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and they all went to bed in high good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</p>
            <p>The next morning, early, Charles and George took a walk to old Joſeph's cottage, in order to prepare him for a viſit from their uncle in the courſe of the day. The good couple were delighted with this intelligence the old man in particular, who declared he
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:034505_0078_0FFE0A1EEF33B998"/>felt himſelf younger for it by four or five years. Before the boys had got half way home, they met Mr. Eaſy, who could not reſtrain his impatience to ſee his old friend; they join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and were witneſſes to a very affecting ſcene upon their arrival at the cottage, where they ſtaid above an hour, and upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home, found breakfaſt almoſt over. Mr. Eaſy acknowledged himſelf much obliged to his brother and ſiſter for their attention to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his old friend, adding, that he knew no body more deſerving of their charity.</p>
            <p>"Pray, Sir," ſaid Sophia, <q>why are you ſo particularly fond of old Joſeph? I know he is a very good man, but he was but a common ſervant.</q>
            </p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Eaſy.</speaker>
               <p>"A common ſervant, my dear Sophia! and is that any reaſon why I ſhould not reſpect his virtues?"</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sophia.</speaker>
               <p>No, papa, but I think there is no occaſion to go and ſit whole hours with a gardener.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Eaſy.</speaker>
               <p>I am ſorry you are of that opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, I ſhould by no mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> wiſh my children to paſs their time in the ſervant's hall, or to make confidential friends of them; but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:034505_0079_0FFE0A6888ADB1E8"/>not conceive I let myſelf down in the leaſt, when I keep company with a poor old man, who ſerved my father faithfully many years; I conſider him as my relation, and his age and infirmities demand my utmoſt atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But, my dear Sophia, where did you get theſe ſtrange notions? I am ſure your couſins think very differently; I wiſh you would learn from them, that when the lower ſort of people fulfil their duty, it is incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon their ſuperiors to treat them at all times with affability, and in ſuch a caſe as this with reſpect.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sophia.</speaker>
               <p>With <hi>reſpect,</hi> papa!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Eaſy.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, Sophia, with <hi>reſpect;</hi> I owe it to Joſeph as being ſo much older, and conſequently, more experienced than myſelf; and I don't know a man upon earth more hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and faithful than he is. To be ſure, he has neither birth or riches to boaſt of, but that does not in the leaſt leſſen his title to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in my opinion.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Mr. Eaſy being very deſirous of going to ſee ſome improvements that had been lately made on his eſtate, which joined to Mr. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venport's, and as he wiſhed his brother and
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:034505_0080_0FFE0A21B5D89F48"/>ſiſter to give him their opinion upon ſome others he had in meditation, the chaiſe was ordered, and being now at the door, they ſat off, meaning to be back by dinner.</p>
            <p>Mary, Caroline, Sophia, and Amelia now went to take a walk in the garden, where the following dialogue paſſed between them.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sophia aſide to her ſiſter.</speaker>
               <p>I think papa has caught the infection of my aunt; you ſee he is beginning to be as croſs as Old Nick.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Amelia.</speaker>
               <p>Lud, I'm Sure I ſhall rejoice when we ſet off for London; I wiſh, with all my heart, we had ſtaid in Q—S—; ſuch ſtupid holidays did I never ſpend before.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sophia.</speaker>
               <p>Well, I ſuppoſe we ſhall go now in leſs than a fortnight. I long for ſome fun again—there is no having any here but at the expenſe of receiving a long lecture.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Amelia.</speaker>
               <p>Aye, I long to be at Miſs Leroux again—Lord, how I'll plague her this time! then the poor dear will write to her ma—ma—and tell—her—what—a naughty girl—Miſs—Amelia Eaſy is! <stage>[Affecting to ſob.]</stage> hah! hah!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sophia.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, yes, that you may depend upon — <hi>a great clumſy ſhouldered thing</hi>—I hate her —ſhe's ſuch a whiny-piny thing.</p>

Mary and Caroline perceiving their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins had no inclination to talk with them, took the firſt opportunity of turning down another walk.</p>
            <p>"I wiſh," ſaid Mary, "my couſins were a <q>little better tempered; I thought we ſhould have been very happy together, but they will hardly take any notice of us, and then whenever mama gives them any little piece of advice, they only ſneer and look at each other as if they were determined not to profit by it.</q>
            </p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Caroline.</speaker>
               <p>I am ſure mama is very good to take that trouble with them; it is more than they deſerve.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mary.</speaker>
               <p>Mama ſees they ſtand much in need of advice, and ſhe is ſo good, that ſhe cannot bear to neglect any opportunity of being of ſervice to them; but I own I ſhall not be at all ſorry when they leave us.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>"That we know very well," cried out So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia (bouncing from behind an evergreen hedge, which ran along the ſide of the walk, where Mary and Caroline were) <q>and I promiſe you, we ſhall not cry when the time comes; for I think you are all ſuch diſagreeable people to live with, that I'm
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:034505_0082_0FFE0A24845F81C0"/>I don't care how ſoon we leave you; and then, when we are gone, you may have as much advice preached as you pleaſe, without fear of our <hi>ſneering,</hi> ha! ha!</q>
            </p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mary.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed, Sophia, I did not think you had been half ſo ill natured as I find you are; I'm ſure my ſiſter and I would like to be friends with you of all things, but that is quite impoſſible, whilſt you continue to ſpeak ſo diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectfully of mama, who loves us all dearly, and who does you much honor when ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcends to tell you of any of your faults.</p>

               <p>For ſhame, for ſhame, Amelia! when you are in a paſſion, you don't care what you ſay, or whom you abuſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Amelia.</speaker>
               <p>And pray, Ma'am, who told you I was in a paſſion; and if I were, what is it to you, you little ſaucy thing, what buſineſs have you to interfere?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sophia.</speaker>
               <p>What <hi>ſweet, amiable, wiſe children</hi> theſe are, ſiſter! Law—why do you ſtay to talk with them? There <hi>my dears, go and play
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:034505_0083_0FFE0A6E35DD1000"/>with your dolls;</hi> flounce away! that's right. Sweet Mary! Sweet Caroline! <hi>angelic little dears!</hi> Adieu!</p>
            </sp>
            <p>The two little Davenports quitted the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, highly diſguſted with the behaviour of their viſitors; but being conſcious that they had nothing to reproach themſelves with, they ſoon forgot their anger. Mary had gath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered a crocus which ſhe ſat down quietly to copy in water colours, and Caroline took ſome ribbon out of her work bag, with which ſhe began to make a watch chain for her brother George, who, together with Charles, had accompanied the chaiſe on horſeback.</p>
            <p>There were large wooden ſhutters on the outſide of the windows belonging to the room where Mary and Caroline were ſitting: So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia and Amelia perceiving theſe, agreed to cloſe them all on a ſudden, and by that means prevent their couſins from purſuing their amuſements in that apartment. They put their ſcheme in execution, and Mary and Caroline were forced to retire to their own room above flairs. Theſe childiſh ill-natured ſiſters then began to throw ſnow balls at the windows, nor would they deſiſt, till they had
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:034505_0084_0FFE0A274D57EC90"/>cracked three or four panes of glaſs: this, however, put an end to their pelting, and they ran into the houſe with their dirty clogs on, up the beſt ſtairs, and bouncing againſt their couſins' door, demanded entrance. Receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no anſwer, they called them every abuſive name they could think of, and thumped and kicked as if they had been breaking through the door.</p>
            <p>Mary now rang the bell, which communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with the houſekeeper's room, where Mrs. Davenport's own maid generally ſat. Mrs. Anne upon coming up, found the Miſs Eaſys had brought chairs and tables out of their own bed chambers, and piled them up in ſuch a manner, that if the little priſoners had unlocked the door (which opened in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly) they would all have tumbled upon them and probably have hurt them much. She attempted to take them down, which irritat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Amelia to ſo great a degree, that ſhe flew at her, and began pinching and thumping her in a threatening tone, commanding her to deſiſt.</p>
            <p>Anne was a good tempered young woman, but had no notion of receiving a blow from any one, eſpecially when ſhe was conſcious
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:034505_0085_0FFE0A7106B51E08"/>ſhe had given no juſt provocation. She there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made not the leaſt ſcruple of returning it. Upon which Sophia, who had all along been encouraging her ſiſter, ran now to her aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. The poor maid ſeeing that ſhe was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to come off the worſt, diſengaged herſelf from her antagoniſts, and made all the haſte ſhe could down ſtairs. Sophia and Amelia were purſuing her, when they heard Mrs. Davenport's voice in the hall, who was that moment come home. They turned ſhort, went up ſtairs (three ſteps at a time) into their own room, and locked themſelves in.</p>
            <p>Anne immediately informed her lady of what had happened, making an apology for the lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty ſhe had taken in ſtriking Miſs Amelia, but that ſhe really had done it in her own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Mrs. Davenport replied, <q>it was a pity ſhe had been forced to go ſuch lengths, but ſhe could not blame her for what ſhe had done.</q> She then deſired her to remove the chairs, &amp;c. and ſend Mary and Caroline down to her in the library. The little girls obeyed, and were ordered to relate the circumſtances of the affray, which they did immediately, but without either juſtifying their own conduct, or
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:034505_0086_0FFE0A28D55C9508"/>condemning that of their couſins. Their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma had never had any reaſon to doubt their veracity; ſhe approved very much of their behaviour, and undertook herſelf to ſettle the quarrel.</p>
            <p>When dinner was ſerved, Mrs. Davenport ſent Mary to tell them, that both dinner bells had rang; but they told her (through the door) that they were not hungry, and did not chooſe to come down. Mary whiſpered this to her mama, upon which Mrs. Daven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port repeated it to her huſband and brother, who were very deſirous to know what had been the matter which ſhe promiſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them of, when the ſervants had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn.</p>
            <p>According to her promiſe, as ſoon as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert was upon the table, ſhe related the whole affair, and concluded with ſaying, that ſhe ſhould take no notice of them, and that ſhe ſuppoſed when they were tired of being alone they would come down. "Upon my word," ſaid Mr. Eaſy, <q>they give themſelves great airs; but I'm quite of your opinion, the
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:034505_0087_0FFE0A73D114F490"/>leſs notice we take of them the better; they mortify <hi>themſelves,</hi> not <hi>us.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>"Certainly," ſaid his brother, <q>if we ſend up to them, it will directly confirm them in the opinion they entertain of their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It was therefore ſettled, that nobody was to go to them, not even a maid to help them to undreſs, or to take them any refreſhment.</p>
            <p>Tea came up, but ſtill the Miſs Eaſys did not make their appearance.</p>
            <p>The following morning, when Ann went up to Mary and Caroline, they inquired if ſhe had ſeen Sophia and Amelia?</p>
            <p>"Oh, yes," Ma'am, ſaid ſhe, <q>they were down before it was light, teaſing the ſcul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion (the only ſervant up) for ſomething to eat; but Bridget, who is not over civil, told them they muſt wait with patience till Mrs. Davies was <hi>ſtirring,</hi> as ſhe had ſhut up the larder over night: then they went up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and began making a monſtrous noiſe. At ſeven Mrs. Davies gave them ſome bread and butter, but they abuſed her, becauſe there was no water boiling to make them tea, though ſhe told the dairy maid to give them
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:034505_0088_0FFE0A2E289ED590"/>ſome milk, warm from the cow; they are now ſitting in the breakfaſt parlour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fire, with their feet on the ſender, talking againſt every body in the houſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt not here omit a good natured action performed by Mary and Caroline.</p>
            <p>When they quitted their room, they ſaw their couſins' door open, upon which they went in, and found the carpet rolled up in a heap, the bed curtains twiſted round the poſts, the pictures turned with their faces to the wall, and the whole apartment in confuſion.</p>
            <p>They knew this would make their mama very angry, and though they had ſo much reaſon to be offended with their couſins, they immediately began putting every thing in order, to prevent them from getting into far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trouble. This took a great deal of time to accompliſh, and though they made as much haſte as poſſible, the clock ſtruck nine before they had quite finiſhed—they were therefore forced to neglect their morning's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, which Mrs. Davenport generally look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over, immediately after breakfaſt. They were now in a great dilemma; they wiſhed much to ſcreen Sophia and Amelia from their
<pb facs="unknown:034505_0089_0FFE0A769B6C2C10"/>
               <figure/>
               <pb n="90" facs="unknown:034505_0090_0FFE0A2FAF1617A8"/>mama's anger; but it could not now be done, but at the expenſe of their own veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as Mrs. Davenport would not fail to aſk how they had been employing themſelves.</p>
            <p>They had never deceived their mama in the moſt trivial affair, and therefore reſolved to declare the whole truth, and rely upon her indulgence in pardoning the offenders.</p>
            <p>They accordingly met her upon the ſtairs, and begged her, as an indulgence to <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> not to ſay any thing about what had paſſed to their couſins.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Davenport embraced them, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending them for their good nature, promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to attend to their requeſt, and all three en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the breakfaſt room together.</p>
            <p>"Here they come," ſaid the eldeſt, as they opened the door, "now for a ſermon!"</p>
            <p>Though Mrs. Davenport diſtinctly heard this impertinent ſpeech, ſhe did not chuſe to notice it, but ſat down to the table, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeaking a word to her nieces, ordered Caroline to wring for the tea kettle. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia did not offer to move, though ſhe ſat cloſe to the bell; Caroline endeavoured to reach it over her couſin's chair, but finding that
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:034505_0091_0FFE0A7969EF1F68"/>impracticable, ſhe whiſpered, <q>Pray Sophia, move a little;</q> upon which Sophia with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out riſing, took hold of her chair with both her hands, and bounced herſelf away with ſuch violence, that ſhe overthrew a ſcreen that ſtood behind her. Amelia burſt into a loud laugh, but ſtill her aunt took no notice. The hot water was brought in, and Mrs. Dav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enport made tea. She gave a cup to each of the girls, but Sophia and Amelia refuſed it, ſaying, "they choſe coffee."</p>

As ſoon as breakfaſt was over, Mr. Eaſy, addreſſing himſelf to his two daughters, told them, <q>he was going to write to Mrs. **** their governeſs, and acquaint her that they would be in Q—e S—e the following Monday.</q>

               <speaker>Mr. Eaſy.</speaker>
               <p>No, I ſhall go with you as far as —, where one of Mrs. D's aſſiſtants will meet, and conduct you to town.</p>

               <stage>(whiſpering her ſiſter.)</stage>
               <p>And a charming journey we ſhall have!</p>
            </sp>
            <p>"Come," ſaid Mr. Eaſy, <q>you had better both leave the room; I ſee you are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to behave ill, and whilſt you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in this perverſe humour, the leſs we have of your company the better.</q>
            </p>
            <p>His daughters took the hint, and flapping the door after them, went grumbling and muttering into the next room.</p>
            <p>"I do not know what to do with thoſe girls," continued Mr. Eaſy, <q>their ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude ſhocks me. I had no idea their diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions were ſo untractable, or I ſhould never have thought of troubling you with them ſo many weeks.</q>
            </p>
            <p>"I am ſure," replied Mr. Davenport, <q>we have not conſidered it as any trouble, but they certainly are not pleaſant girls to have in the houſe.</q>
            </p>
            <sp>
               <pb n="94" facs="unknown:034505_0094_0FFE0A342937C9D0"/>
               <speaker>Mr. Eaſy.</speaker>
               <p>I wiſh you would adviſe me what method to purſue. I ſometimes think of taking a houſe in town, and providing a good governeſs, for I am convinced that ſchool is not the place for them: It is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Mrs. — can attend to all; a hundred little things muſt paſs unnoticed; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, a governeſs at home has nothing to do but to attend to them alone, and if ſhe is a ſenſible woman, ſhe will know how to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect their faults, and at the ſame time en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage their affections.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Mr. Davenport approved this plan, but thought it a dangerous one to carry into exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, as ſo much depended upon their choice of the perſon. They talked a long while up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſubject: at length, in conſequence of a propoſal made by Mr. Davenport, it was ſettled in the following manner: viz. as Mr. Davenport meant in future to ſpend the firſt part of every year in town, for the ſake of having proper maſters for his children, there could be no reaſon why Sophia and Amelia ſhould not then leave ſchool, and live entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with them: by theſe means they would have proper attention paid to their educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:034505_0095_0FFE0A7F05DC2EE0"/>without running any hazard whatſoever.</p>
            <p>This ſcheme was highly pleaſing to Mr. Eaſy, it rid him at once of all his anxiety, and he felt himſelf infinitely obliged to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ſiſter for this great proof of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of their friendſhip.</p>
            <p>At dinner Sophia and Amelia ſaid little. Mr. Davenport generally aſked the former to drink a glaſs of wine with him, he omitted the compliment that day, but Sophia helped herſelf out of the decanter that ſtood between her and her ſiſter, who immediately followed her example.</p>
            <p>When Mrs. Davenport roſe from table, George followed her out of the room, and aſked leave to have the concluſion of the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tale read out before his couſins went away: his mama told him he might read it to them and his ſiſters that afternoon: he thanked her for this indulgence, and ran im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to fetch the book. Having called his brother, and found out the place where they had left off, he began as follows:</p>
            <p>She, (that is, Benevolenta,) ſoon found out that Melpomene was in the palace of Horridona, a fairy, who made a common
<pb facs="unknown:034505_0096_0FFE0A39903E7280"/>practice of ſtealing away children with the cruel deſign of returning them to their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents with perverted minds and unhappy tempers. With this view ſhe indulged them in every wiſh, whether innocent or wicked: ſhe threw all ſorts of temptations in their way, and at the ſame time, by her example and advice, eradicated every good principle that might ſerve to reſiſt them.</p>
            <p>Benevolenta was ſhocked to find this poor little princeſs in ſo terrible a ſituation, and was reſolved to uſe all poſſible means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve her. She immediately ſummoned the powerful genii Boccadindo, and intreated him to aſſiſt her. Boccadindo brought with him the little Fidelio: this amiable little creature had been brought up with the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt care and attention by a fairy aunt. To a beautiful figure was added the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging diſpoſition, and the moſt benevolent heart. Hearing from the fairy the ſituation of the princeſs, he begged her to permit him to exert himſelf for her relief "Alas! my child," ſaid Benevolenta, "her mind, I fear, is already perverted."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="unknown:034505_0097_0FFE0A81CF3F36A8"/>
"Let us hope not," ſaid Boccadindo; <q>ſhe muſt not be loſt; and if the power of example can be of any ſervice to her, ſhe cannot have a better pattern of goodneſs than Fidelio.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Fidelio returned the genii thanks for the good opinion he entertained of him, and kiſſing the fairy's hand, conjured her to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy him in the undertaking.</p>
            <p>Benevolenta expreſſed the fears ſhe enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for his own ſafety, and promiſed to yield to his intreaties, provided the genii would give him a taliſman ſufficiently pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful to repel any rude attacks, the evil coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of Horridona might make upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of his heart.</p>
            <p>"Never fear, Madam," replied Boccadin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, <q>he has no need of taliſmans to preſerve him free from guilt; ſuch precautions are needleſs, his own heart, and the edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation he has received, are taliſmans of much greater power than any he can be furniſhed with.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The fairy now no longer heſitated, ſhe gave her conſent to the undertaking, and the
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:034505_0098_0FFE0A3E16892E28"/>genii preſented Fidelio with a ſlipper, which, upon putting on his foot, would immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly procure what money, clothes, &amp;c. he might want for his journey.</p>
            <p>Fidelio was now tranſported with joy: it had been foretold he would one time or other have it in his power to redeem a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs from captivity, and by the force of his example to reclaim her from the paths of vice. His generous heart exulted at the idea that the time for the accompliſhment of the prophecy was come, and the eagerneſs he teſtified, proceeded purely from the deſire of doing good, and not from any ſelfiſh views with regard to his own intereſt.</p>
            <p>Boccadindo now took his leave; Fidelio put on the enchanted ſlipper, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately the ground opened beneath him, and a little white horſe appeared, ready bridled and ſadled. The young prince mounted him, and was preſently out of ſight.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the king and queen of Roſyland had iſſued a proclamation, prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſing honours and riches to that perſon who ſhould bring the princeſs ſafe to their arms. Many were induced to undertake this cauſe,
<pb facs="unknown:034505_0099_0FFE0A3B17CBB490"/>
               <figure/>
               <pb n="100" facs="unknown:034505_0100_0FFE0A8497E02AD8"/>by the flattering proſpects before them, but they all returned without any ſucceſs, not having patience enough to follow the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as they were wholly unacquainted with the abode of Horridona.</p>
            <p>Fidelio was equally ignorant of the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her palace, but by his unceaſing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions, and unrelenting fortitude, ſucceeded at laſt in the diſcovery. He travelled nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days through unfrequented deſerts and dreary woods; on the 20th, juſt before ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, he found himſelf in a large plain, at the farther end of which he perceived the palace of Delights, as it was erroneouſly ſtiled by the owner. The walls were ebony, the porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos of ſolid gold, the window frames and roof of the ſame metal. The weſtern ſun ſhone full upon it, and made it, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſted with the dark gloom of ſome lofty pines that grew on each ſide, a moſt beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful object. Fidelio was delighted to behold the end of his journey, and immediately gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loped towards it. Upon his arrival at the grand entrance, he diſmounted, and taking the ſlipper from one of his ſaddle bags, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully depoſited it in his boſom, and telling
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:034505_0101_0FFE0AC573F139D8"/>his little horſe he had no preſent uſe for him, it immediately diſappeared. He aſcended a flight of ebony ſteps, with gold balluſtrades, and entered a lofty hall, ſurrounded with a colonnade of ebony pillars, the baſes and chapiters ornamented with gold, and wreaths of gold flowers twiſted round the columns. The dome wore the appearance of the ſtarry firmament on a froſty night. Oppoſite the great door was an arch, which ſerved as an entrance to the bottom of a grand ſtaircaſe of ſolid gold, which led up to a long gallery of white marble, whoſe walls were inlaid and the floor of different coloured marble; this opened into a ſuite of apartments, whoſe elegance was equal to their magnificence. He had already paſſed through twenty-nine rooms, every one varying from the other; he at length came into an octagon one of pea green marble, hung all round with large feſtoons of white and red roſes, whoſe frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancy perfumed the apartment—a ſmall fountain of ſcented water roſe in the middle.
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:034505_0102_0FFE0A8763366398"/>There were ſix niches, in which were placed alabaſter ſtatues of exquiſite workmanſhip. On the oppoſite ſide of the room to that by which he had entered, was a green ſilk cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; upon drawing this aſide, he found himſelf in a portico of white marble, which commanded a view of the park and gardens belonging to this beautiful palace. On the north the proſpect was bounded by moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, whoſe tops were covered with ſnow; theſe however, were at ſo great a diſtance, and the intervening country ſo beautiful, that, far from affording a dreary aſpect, they added new charms to the ſcene. The palace ſtood upon a lawn of the fineſt verdure, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by a wide river that meandered through the adjacent country, and at length emptied itſelf into the ſea, which terminated the view on the ſouth. The flower garden, which was of great extent, was bounded by a colonnade of white marble; this was hollow and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, ſo that at night, lamps were lighted in the inſide, and altogether it had a very pleaſing effect. A delightful concert was heard on the water, on which a number of boats were ſailing. A magnificent bridge
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:034505_0103_0FFE0AC8432B7A48"/>was thrown over it, and the whole proſpect together was ſo enchanting, that Fidelio for a moment forgot the princeſs, and ſtood wrapt in aſtoniſhment. Whilſt he was gaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round with admiring eyes, he obſerved a party of young men and women below, who were making ſigns to him to come down: he immediately recollected himſelf, and haſtened to join them. They paid him a thouſand compliments, and offered their ſervices in ſhewing him the beauties of the place. He thanked them for their polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and told them he only wiſhed to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced to the fairy. "You may have that pleaſure," they replied, "in a few min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utes. She preſides at our table, and we are in momentary expectation of a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to attend her. You will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly charmed with her; the beauties of her perſon are only rivalled by the brill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iancy of her wit; and when once you have paſſed a few minutes with her, you will never have reſolution enough to quit her palace."</p>
            <p>While they were yet ſpeaking, a band of martial muſic ſtruck up, immediately num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:034505_0104_0FFE0A8A33789AF0"/>of people iſſued from all parts of the garden; thoſe who were on the water land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in great haſte, and the whole multitude eagerly crowded towards a large building that had, till then, eſcaped Fidelio's obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thoſe with whom he had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing joined the reſt, and by the force of others puſhing forward, he at laſt entered an immenſe banquetting houſe, lighted up with a profuſion of lamps; it was, however, kept very cool, the windows being all open and ſhaded with green ſilk curtains. In the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle was a table that could be enlarged or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted at pleaſure, ſo that of whatever num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the company conſiſted, it always appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed full. The entertainment was magnificent; the moſt exquiſite viands were ſerved in great abundance in maſſy gold. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany being all aſſembled, a large folding door was thrown open, and twenty beautiful young girls entered the hall, dancing to the ſound of the muſic above mentioned; they each of them held a large wreath of flowers, with which they formed a ſort of triumphal arch for the fairy to paſs through. Soft muſic was now heard, and Horridona entered, her
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:034505_0105_0FFE0ACB0EA8CEC0"/>train born by a page, whoſe dreſs entirely conſiſted of precious ſtones.</p>
            <p>Fidelio was now preſented to the fairy, who aſked him in an affable tone of voice, "What had led him to her palace?" Total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unuſed to deceit, he found it difficult to conceal the true motive of his journey; but knowing how fatal ſuch an avowal muſt prove to the ſucceſs of his cauſe, he replied with heſitation, that it was "curioſity." Horridona expecting him to have launched out in praiſe of the edifice and its owner, was not a little diſappointed at his anſwer. She ſmiled at his confuſion, and turning to his companions, "You muſt inſpire this young man," ſaid ſhe "with a little more courage; our magnificence confounds him; he will like us better when he knows more of us; in the mean time you muſt give him confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; he is by far too baſhful." To ſay the truth, Fidelio hung down his head, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to great diſadvantage, but he had ſufficient cauſe to be diſconcerted. The fairy appeared to him the moſt hideous figure he had ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held: independent of the frightfulneſs of her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it required but a ſmall degree of phyſiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:034505_0106_0FFE0A8D015ED098"/>to diſcover in her face that her mind was equally horrible. But now ſhe gave the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal for the commencement of feſtivity. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delio ſuffered himſelf to be led to the table; but although the greateſt dainties were offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him by his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ompanions, he could not be prevailed upon to caſte a ſingle morſel. His fright had taken away his appetite; he ſtill continued to hang his head, now and then ſtealing a look at thoſe who ſat next him, many of whom he ſhortly perceived were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining themſelves with ridiculing his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed air. Melpomene inſtantly ruſhed into his mind; he quickly recovered himſelf, and caſting a look of eager inquiry all around him, endeavoured, but in vain, to ſee the princeſs. His prudence now ſuggeſted to him, that the only way to get intelligence of her, was to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend himſelf to the perſon in whoſe power ſhe was, by conforming in ſome degree to the manners of her court.</p>
            <p>Clovis and Lydia, who ſat on each ſide of him, congratulated him on the return of his ſpirits. Young and giddy they had no idea of pleaſure exiſting any where but in Horridona's palace. It is true, when firſt
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:034505_0107_0FFE0ACDD7394830"/>they were introduced to her, they were, like Fidelio, ſtartled at her figure; but as they were then but children, and their principles unfixed, they were ſoon reconciled to her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and being deceived by the falſe glare of happineſs that ſhone in the feaſts and balls with which ſhe daily entertained them, this horror gradually wore off, and they now conſidered her in the ſame light as they had deſcribed her to Fidelio.</p>
            <p>This young prince, no longer embarraſſed, gave attention to all that was paſſing. The converſation (interrupted by loud burſts of laughter) was ſuch as I am purſuaded would afford no amuſement to my readers, were it to be repeated. Fidelio could join but little in it: he was even ſometimes almoſt tempted to ſtop his ears.</p>
            <p>The meats being removed, a magnificent deſert, with the moſt curious wines, was plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the table. In the middle was a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple made of little diamond men and women, carrying baſkets of ſweetmeats; they march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to the top of the table, knelt to the queen, and then dividing into two parties,
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:034505_0108_0FFE0A8FEB59B7A0"/>preſented each of the company with a baſket; meeting at the bottom, they joined hands, and danced back to the temple to the ſound of a harp, which was played by a diamond boy ſitting on the dome of the temple. None of the figures in this curious piece of mechan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm were more than ſeven inches high. It was near midnight when they quitted the banquetting-room: intoxicated with the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors they had been drinking, they reeled after the queen into a large myrtle bower, where they were each preſented with a goblet filled from a fountain whoſe water had the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of recovering thoſe who drank it from the effects of intemperance. Here the party ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; ſome returned to the palace, and ſpent the remainder of the night in gaming, others again ſat down to drink; dances were made in different parts of the gardens, but they were conducted without the leaſt deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, and all was riot and confuſion. In the mean time Fidelio, who had left the table at an early hour, had made a diſcovery that gave him no little joy. Fatigued with the noiſe and nonſenſe that prevailed among the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in the hall, he ſtole away unperceived,
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:034505_0109_0FFE0AD09FC842D0"/>and going into the park which was already il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated, rambled about for ſome time: at laſt he croſſed the river, and directed his courſe towards the wood that fronted the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ace. Here he was preparing to reſt himſelf from the fatigues he had lately undergone, when the voices of ſome children caught his ear; he immediately haſtened towards the place from whence they ſeemed to proceed. He perceived a ſmall palace of white marble: the portico was lighted up, and the doors being open he entered a hall, where a number of beautiful children were running and jumping about.</p>
            <p>Upon ſeeing Fidelio, they immediately ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded him, and began pulling off the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond fringe with which his mantle was trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, others ran away with his ſword-knot and ſhoe-roſes; but as there was not finery enough for them all, what little there was, quickly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came an object of contention. Words were ſoon ſucceeded by blows, and all the meaſures Fidelie took to pacify them were of no effect. Amidſt the confuſion of voices, he frequently heard the name of Melpomene pronounced: he ſoon diſcovered her to be one of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in the battle. Her little face was diſtort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with fury, the ſtowers which had ornament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:034505_0110_0FFE0A92B3560378"/>her dreſs, were torn to pieces; roaring and ſtamping with vehemence, ſhe pleaded her birth as a diſtinction that entitled her to the jewels.</p>
            <p>The uproar ſtill increaſing, at laſt brought ſome of their nurſes, who, upon ſeeing the manner in which they were engaged, ran back and immediately returned with a quantity of toys and ſweetmeats to quiet them. Our young prince now ſtept forward, and apologiſed for the trouble he had occaſioned. They replied, <q>it was a pity he had come at all, the children were all of the ſweeteſt diſpoſitions in the world, and he was highly blameable in not providing himſelf with jewels enough for them all.</q> It was in vain that Fidelio urged as an excuſe, his accidentally coming near the place; they would not liſten to him, and it was not without a great deal of grumbling, and upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that he brought ſomething for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that they gave him permiſſion to call again.</p>
            <p>"Fortunate Fidelio!" ſaid the young fairy to himſelf as he retired from the wood, <q>you have found the object of your ſearch.</q> But this joy was of ſhort continuance; for when he reflected on the ſituation of the unfortunate Melpomene, the proſpect of her deliverance appeared to him at a greater diſtance than ever. "Alas!" exclaimed the almoſt deſperate Fid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elio,
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:034505_0111_0FFE0AD38BDCAEA0"/>
               <q>of what preſumption have I not been guilty, in offering my ſervice to the queen of Roſyland, towards the recovery of her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter! Were ſhe inſtantly removed to the palace of ALMANZOROASTER, and placed under the guidance and protection of the beſt and the moſt powerful of the genii, even there it would require the labour of years to eradicate from her boſom thoſe ſeeds of vice which Horridona has plentifully ſown, and diligently cultivated. And ſhall I, who am myſelf a child, pretend to combat and to overcome obſtacles which would impede the progreſs of Almanzoroaſter, and that too in the habitation of Horridona, in the midſt of dangerous inſtructions, and equally danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous examples? Can my weak eloquence per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade her to virtue, when every other hand preſents a new allurement to pleaſure, and every other tongue a freſh incitement to vice? Detained by the united powers of ſin, folly, and Horridona, what preſumption muſt it be in a child to pretend to break her chains? No, the freedom of Melpomene muſt be effected by a ſtronger arm than that of the inexperienced Fidelio. And yet,</q> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a moments recollection within himſelf, <q>with what face can I meet the fairy Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenta,
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:034505_0112_0FFE0A9580CFBBB0"/>and tell her that I had entered the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ace of Pleaſure, but had returned without Melpomene? That I had diſcovered the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, but had not the courage, the generoſity to attempt her deliverance? How can I tell her that I am a coward, unworthy of her confidence, and the good opinion of the genii Boceadindo! It muſt not be; the prophecy <hi>ſhall</hi> be fulfilled. I ſwear by the enchanted wand of the mighty Almanzoroaſter, that I will not relinquiſh the palace of Horridona till the deliverance is effected by nature or Fidelio.</q>
            </p>
            <p>George was here interrupted by the arrival of ſome company to tea, which unluckily prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the concluſion of the fairy tale from being read that evening. I ſay unluckily, as the book then diſappeared, and though ſearched for the next day in every corner of the houſe, was no where to be found. Many were the conject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures formed upon this occaſion by the little Dave ports: their mama could eaſily have ſet them right, as ſhe was privy to the affair.</p>
            <p>She had ſeen Sophia ſteal behind George's chair, and (as ſhe thought unobſerved) ſnatch up the book and put it in her pocket. When inquiries after it were made the next day by the children, this good lady was ſurpriſed to
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:034505_0113_0FFE0AD794B9F438"/>ſee with what <hi>ſang-froid</hi> Sophia perſiſted in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying any knowledge of the tranſaction. Shocked to the laſt degree, ſhe forbad any thing farther being ſaid on the ſubject, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted their attention by the introduction of another book, equally entertaining and more inſtructive. Mrs. Davenport was unwilling to pain her brother by the knowledge of his daughter's behaviour, and therefore declined taking any notice of it at that time; but no ſooner did ſhe retire to her own dreſſing room, than ſhe wrote a letter to her governeſs, in which ſhe intreated her in the ſtrongeſt terms to watch over her pupil during the time ſhe was to remain in Q—S—e, and to do her utmoſt to eradicate the hateful vice ſhe had contracted.</p>
            <p>This letter produced much mortification to Sophia, after her return to ſchool; for Mrs. S. affiſted by the hint ſhe had received, convicted her in many untruths, for all of which ſhe was puniſhed with the greateſt ſeverity.</p>
            <p>The following day, as the young people were ſitting together after breakfaſt, Harry Lively came in, and informed the Miſs Eaſys, that he was going to ride with his papa to the next town, and that knowing they were to ſet off the next morning for ſchool, he came to
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:034505_0114_0FFE0A984A7E9D70"/>inquire if he could execute any commiſſions for them. "O yes," ſaid Sophia, "I want a hundred things, but I ſuppoſe there is no get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them in this naſty Yorkſhire."—"Why not, couſins?" ſaid Charles; "I wiſh you had told me what you wanted, and I think I could have contrived to have got them ſome way or other. You may get any thing at York."—"Yes, indeed fifty miles off; you are none of you ſo kind as to ſend ſo far for any body but yourſelves."—"Yes," ſaid Charles, <q>they could have come very well with papa's books the other day; but I dare ſay, if you will write down what you want, Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry will get them for you if they are to be had in the town of—.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Sophia now taking out her pencil, with the aſſiſtance of Amelia, wrote a long lift of articles, which they deſired Harry Lively not to ſhow to any body, nor would they permit him to read it out.—"But," ſaid the poor boy (whilſt they were cramming the paper into his waiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat pocket,) "I don't know at what ſhops theſe things are ſold."—"Poh," cried Sophia, <q>can't you remember when I tell you, the three firſt are to be had at the haberdaſhers, the two next at the grocers, the two that come afterwards at the toy ſhop, the three next at the ſtationers, and the five laſt at the

                  <pb n="116" facs="unknown:034505_0116_0FFE0A9B19DCC9E0"/>paſtrycooks. There, that's all, now go, my dear; make haſte, I dare ſay your papa is waiting; but do you hear, you need not go ſending all theſe things here to-night—that will be quite fooliſh of you—I ſhould not wiſh to have them before to-morrow; ſo you need not put yourſelf out of the way by call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here in your way back. Good bye, I'm ſory to give you ſo much trouble—and then, if you ſhould not be able to meet with any of theſe articles,—</q>
            </p>
            <p>"I'll let you know," replied Harry.— <q>No, no, not for the world—no, I don't want to hear—if you get them, why, then you'll ſend them to-morrow, if not, it can't be help't.</q>
            </p>
            <p>A ſervant now informed Maſter Lively, that his papa had called for him, upon which Harry took his leave, not very well pleaſed with the ſucceſs of his viſit; for though his meaning was ſincere, when he offered his ſervices, he had no idea of receiving ſuch a multiplicity of commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as he was gone, "pray, couſins," ſaid Charles, <q>will you accept of a trifle which my brother and I have been making for you?</q>
            </p>
            <sp>

               <p>Yes; the plate is made out of an old doll's tea-board that belonged to Mary; ſo we covered it with paper, painted the circles, and varniſhed it with thick gum-water. The ſun is made of clay, and ſo indeed are the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets; but then we ſtuck gold leaf on the ſun to make it look like braſs, becauſe the ſun in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa's planetarium is made of braſs.</p>

               <p>"The Copernican ſyſtem conſiſts of the ſun, ſeven primary, twelve ſecondary planets, and the comets. The ſeven planets, Mercury, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, the Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the Georgium Sidus, move round the ſun in orbits, included one within the other, and in the order here uſed in mentioning their names; Mercury being that which is neareſt the ſun. Theſe ſeven, which revolve round the ſun as their center, are called primary planets: the
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:034505_0119_0FFE0ADEADB6BA70"/>twelve ſmall planets revolve round the primary ones as their center, and are at the ſame time carried round the ſun with them; they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called ſecondary planets, moons, or ſatel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites. The Georgium Sidus is attended by two moons, Saturn by five, Jupiter by four, and the Earth by one. All of theſe, except the laſt, are inviſible to our naked eye, on account of the ſmallneſs of their ſize, and the greatneſs of their diſtance from us."</p>

               <p>So, this is the Copernican ſyſtem. I wonder why it is called ſo.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Amelia.</speaker>

               <p>This new proof of Amelia's ſelf-conceit and ignorance was ſo perfectly ridiculous, that the little Davenports could not refrain from laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Amelia was highly affronted, and, in an angry tone of voice, inſiſted on knowing what was the occaſion of their merriment. Mary apologized for her rudeneſs, but owned that it was impoſſible to help it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
               <p>To be ſure, it was rude to laugh, but you made ſuch a droll miſtake! I wonder you ſhould be ignorant that it was ſo called from Copernicus, a Dane, who lived, if I am not miſtaken, in the fifteenth century. The
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:034505_0120_0FFE0AA1F190F318"/>ancients believed that the ſun was the center of the ſyſtem; but Ptolemy, an Egyptian philoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opher, treated this notion as a falſe one, and ſuppoſed the earth as the center, and the ſun and planets deſcribing their orbits round it. But this opinion was totally rejected by Coper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus, who revived the old ſyſtem, and eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed it upon firm and indiſputable proofs.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>The converſation now turned upon another ſubject, and they remained without any more diſputes till they went up to dreſs for dinner. Mrs. Davenport was far from wiſhing her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to give up much of their time to the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their perſons, but the always inſiſted upon their being very clean and neat. Mary and Caroline had the care of their own clothes, and their mama looked them over from time to time, to ſee that they kept them in proper order.</p>
            <p>As they were ſitting at table, during dinner, one of the ſervants delivered a note to Sophia, which, upon opening, ſhe found was from Harry Lively; ſhe immediately gueſſed the contents, and colouring, crumpled it up, and put it in her pocket.

               <speaker>Mr. Eaſy.</speaker>
               <p>I ſhould rather ſuſpect the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, as you bluſhed exceedingly when you looked at it, and ſeemed fearful of being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by any one. I ſhall think you extremly blameable if you do not ſhew it of your own accord to your aunt, as you ought certainly to keep no ſecret from her; and I'm certain that if you have got into any difficulty, ſhe will, with her uſual indulgence, do all in her pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to aſſiſt you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sophia.</speaker>
               <p>No, Sir, I'd rather not ſhew it; it can be of no ſort of conſequence to my aunt.</p>

               <p>I ſhould wiſh you volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to make a friend of me upon all occaſions. Mary and Caroline would not, I am convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, keep a ſecret from me upon any account; and why ſhould you behave differently?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sophia.</speaker>
               <p>I don't ſee any harm, Ma'am, in not ſhewing you every letter I receive, I aſſure you, Ma'am, there is nothing about <hi>you</hi> in it.</p>

               <speaker>Mrs. Davenport.</speaker>
               <p>Nothing about me! Do you then ſuppoſe that it is from a motive of curioſity that I wiſh to ſee your note?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sophia.</speaker>
               <p>I don't know what it can be elſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Eaſy.</speaker>
               <p>For ſhame! for ſhame, Sophia! You judge of others by yourſelf. But to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:034505_0122_0FFE0AA378FB5760"/>the matter at once; I do not chuſe you to receive any letter whatever without acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your uncle, aunt, or myſelf with its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents; I inſiſt therefore upon your ſhewing it immediately.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>"Well, then, there it is," ſaid Sophia, toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it into the middle of the table,—"there's more fuſs made about it than it is worth."</p>
            <p>Amelia caſt her eye upon it as it lay, and perceiving Harry Lively's name, eagerly ſnatched it up, and threw it under the table, as ſhe was as unwilling as her ſiſter that it ſhould be ſeen, knowing that it muſt infallibly bring them both into a ſcrape.</p>
            <p>Mr. Eaſy immediately deſired her to pick it up; he was vexed at their behaviour, and was determined not to give way to them.</p>
            <p>Amelia at firſt heſitated whether or no ſhe ſhould obey her father; but upon his repeating this command, in a raiſed tone of voice, ſhe thought it better to comply, and accordingly, with an unwilling hand, delivered it to him.</p>
            <p>Mr. Eaſy juſt looked it over, and then read as follows: "Harry Lively preſents his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments to the Miſs Eaſys; when he offered his ſervices this morning, he really meant to be of uſe to them; but if they had conſidered his offer as a mere compliment, they could not have treated him worſe. He returns the liſt
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:034505_0123_0FFE0AE582968D48"/>they furniſhed him with, and as he underſtands Mr. Eaſy is to accompany them, hopes they will have a ſafe and pleaſant journey to town."</p>
            <p>The contents of the paper that was incloſed greatly vexed and ſurpriſed Mr. Eaſy: it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a pack of unintelligible names, all calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to raiſe a laugh againſt poor Harry.</p>
            <p>Mr. Eaſy ſeverely reprimanded his daughters for this piece of miſchief: it was a proof, he ſaid, both of their ingratitude and ill-breeding; he was now convinced that their diſpoſitions would not bear indulgence, and that, for the future, they muſt expect none from him, as he was determined to try what effect ſeverity would have upon them. He accordingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired them to go up into their own apartment immediately, and upon no account, to make their appearance till the horſes were ready the following morning. Sophia and her ſiſter ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw their father ſo angry before; they had no excuſe to make for their behaviour, and not wiſhing to be farther expoſed before their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins, they inſtantly obeyed his commands. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtairs they found Ann packing up their clothes; the planetarium lay upon the table, and ſhe was juſt going to put it in their trunk, when So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia ſnatching it from her, threw it to the other end of the room. "What a fool you
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:034505_0124_0FFE0AA6587A9A00"/>are to let it lie there," ſaid Amelia. "Mrs. Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to-rights," meaning Mrs. Davenport, "will ſpy it out, and make miſchief of it; you had better put it out of the window at once."</p>
            <p>"A good thought! returned Sophia, open the window, and out it ſhall go! plannatum, or foolatum, or whatever it is called."</p>
            <p>While this ſcene was paſſing above, Mr. Eaſy was lamenting the neceſſity there was of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his daughters with the utmoſt rigour: he <hi>had</hi> hoped to have made companions and friends of them very early in life, but they had, by their late behaviour, deſtroyed his hopes, and he looked forward to nothing but oppoſition to the plans he had formed.</p>
            <p>Amelia and Sophia, contrary to their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's expectation, were punctual to the time appointed for their departure. They were very ſulky all breakfaſt time; and when they heard that the horſes were put to, roſe up with an eagerneſs by no means conſiſtent either with gratitude or common politeneſs, as it plainly evinced their impatience to leave thoſe rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions who had ſhewed ſo much true kindneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. Mrs. Davenport deſired they would write to her as ſoon as they had reached Q—S—e, that ſhe might know if they had got ſafe to the end of their journey. They
<pb facs="unknown:034505_0125_0FFE0AE70B105238"/>
               <figure/>
               <pb n="126" facs="unknown:034505_0126_0FFE0AA925A659F8"/>promiſed to comply with her requeſt, but did not think it neceſſary to thank her for the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt ſhe took in their welfare. They jumped into the chaiſe, hardly taking any leave of their couſins, who ſtood amazed at their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour. Mr. Eaſy promiſed to return in a few days, and tenderly embracing his ſiſter and nieces, followed his unpromiſing daughters into the carriage, which drove away immedately.</p>
            <p>Mr. Davenport and his ſons mounted their horſes at the ſame time, meaning to accompany them for a few miles.</p>
            <p>When they were all out of ſight, Mrs. Daven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, who had been watching them down the avenue, turned to Mary and Caroline, and kiſſing them, ſaid, "my dear little girls will, I hope, make a proper uſe of the ſcenes they have been witneſſes to, and carefully avoid the many errors which their couſins, for want of proper advice, have fallen into."</p>
            <p>Mary and Caroline promiſed their mama they would be more attentive than ever to the advice ſhe was ſo kind as to give them from time to time, and Mary expreſſed her happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at the proſpect there was of her couſins amendment, when they ſhould all live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as Mrs. Davenport could then pay the ſame attention to their morals, as ſhe had done to thoſe of her own children.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="unknown:034505_0127_0FFDC679A5F77B80"/>
"At preſent, my dears, "ſaid Mrs. Daven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port," they ſeem but little inclined to liſten to any thing for their good. I have endeavoured to be of uſe to them, but all to no purpoſe: yet I cannot bring myſelf to think that their hearts are bad: I rather wiſh to ſuppoſe the impropriety of their behaviour proceeds from a childiſh heedleſſneſs that has grown to an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larming height, by keeping company with girls more fooliſh than themſelves. However, when we all live together, I ſhall labour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing to correct their faults, and hope one day or other to make them worthy of their father's affection."</p>
            <p>Mrs. Davenport then deſired her daughters to put on their hats, and come with her into the grounds. They paſſed through that part of the garden directly under the windows of the bed-room which the Miſs Eaſys had occupied. Caroline perceived ſomething laying on the graſs, and running to ſee what it was, felt mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified and ſurpriſed to find the little planeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium entirely ſpoilt. She picked it up, and with tears in her eyes, "ſee, mama," ſaid ſhe, "what theſe ill-natured girls have done. My brothers were ſo happy whilſt they were mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it for them, and now ſee what it is come to!"—"Poor Charles," ſaid Mary, "how ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry he and his brother will be!"—"This is
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:034505_0128_0FFE0AAD2F087F30"/>of a piece," replied Mrs. Davenport, "with their behaviour to Harry Lively; this almoſt makes me deſpair of their amendment. I look upon ingratitude as a great crime, and when carried to this height, it fills me with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion for their future conduct. But do not let your brothers ſee this, as I know it will give them pain, and their good nature deſerves a better return."—"I'll take it into my own room, directly, mama," returned Caroline; "to be ſure it is now of no uſe, but yet it would be a pity to throw it away, ſo I'll keep it for my brothers' ſake, and whenever I look on it, I ſhall think of their good nature, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how ungrateful my couſins were about it."—"I would wiſh you, my dear girl," ſaid her mama, "to make uſe of every circumſtance that may ſtrenghten your affection for Charles and George, but I ſhould rather wiſh you to throw the planetarium away, than that it ſhould ſerve to remind you of any unfavourable opinions you may have formed of your couſins."</p>
            <p>"Why, mama," ſaid Caroline, "to tell you the truth, I was very glad to ſee my couſins at firſt, and I expected to paſs many happy days with them; but they turned out to be ſuch ill natured girls, and ſo different from what I and my ſiſter wiſhed them to be, that I really don't care if I never ſee them again."</p>

               <speaker>Mrs. Davenport.</speaker>
               <p>You muſt remember whoſe children they are, and confider how nearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated they are to you. Remember too, you will in future all live together, and if you don't agree then,—</p>

               <speaker>Mrs. Davenport.</speaker>
               <p>If, Indeed, their friendſhip is only to be purchaſed at that price, I do not deſire it to ſubſiſt between you. No, my dear girls, it muſt be your part to ſet them a good example; and the happineſs you enjoy from a conſciouſneſs of doing right, muſt unavoidably prove, in the end, an inducement to them to imitate you.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Depend upon it, they will then alter their behaviour: they conſidered themſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Yes, my dear, you will have much more buſineſs on your hands than you have now. You will likewiſe have a muſic maſter, and the year after you will learn draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Italian.</p>

               <speaker>Mrs. Davenport.</speaker>
               <p>He did, my dear: I hope the poor old man is better this morning: he was very bad yeſterday.</p>

               <p>Yes, mama, George told me he never ſaw him look ſo ill before: the weather has been ſo bad lately.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. Davenport.</speaker>
               <p>He is ſo infirm, that every change affects him.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>They now entered the houſe, and the two little girls went to their ſtudies.</p>
            <p>About the uſual dinner time, a ſervant arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſent by Mr. Davenport, to let his family
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:034505_0132_0FFE0AB1A1D2D040"/>know he ſhould not return that night, as old Joſeph was at the point of death, and he could not leave him in that ſtate. George and Charles likewiſe remained at the cottage. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on making ſome inquiries, Mrs. Davenport found that when her brother ſtopped there in his way to town, Joſeph was very ill, and as he was to paſs through the town where the phyſician lived, he immediately went forward with all diligence, and meant to continue his journey with the ſame ſpeed, that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn as ſoon as poſſible to his old friend. The ſervant added, the phyſician had ſince arrived, and found his patient in a worſe ſtate than either his maſter or Mr. Eaſy had ſuſpected him to be; in ſhort, he had declared it to be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible he ſhould ſurvive that night.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Davenport and her two little girls were ſenſibly affected with this news: they had no appetite for their dinner, and though they ſat at table, hardly eat any thing.</p>
            <p>There was a large medicine cheſt in the houſekeeper's-room, the phyſician was acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with its contents, and had deſired a few of the articles to be ſent to him at old Joſeph's cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Mrs. Davenport likewiſe ſent her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band a large wrapping gown, and a great coat to each of her ſons, as it was very cold weath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſit up all night. In the courſe of the
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:034505_0133_0FFE0AF231028A10"/>night old Joſeph breathed his laſt. Upon Mr. Eaſy's return, he ſettled a ſmall annuity upon the widow and her grand-daughter, and Mr. Davenport placed them in a ſmall cottage with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his domains. The Midſummer holidays Miſs Eaſys ſpent at ſchool; Mrs. Davenport's requeſt of a letter from them was never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with, a circumſtance which gave her no little pain.</p>
            <p>Much as ſhe wiſhed'to produce a reformation in theſe wayward girls, yet ſhe could not help anticipating a little of the anxiety which would attend the execution of her plan; theſe reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would ſometimes throw a damp over that mild cheerfulneſs for which ſhe was ſo much admired. But now the time arrived for their long-projected journey, the houſe was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready taken in Berkley Square; ſome of the ſervants were on their way to town, and the day was fixed for the departure of the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the family. Upon their arrival in town, they ſent to inform Mrs. S. the governeſs.</p>
            <p>Sophia and Amelia, who were not acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Mr. Davenport's intention of paſſing a few months of the winter in town, were not a little ſurpriſed at the ſummons to leave ſchool. Mrs. Davenport received them with that affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which, though ſo ill merited on their part,
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:034505_0134_0FFE0AB46E0BF6C0"/>ſhe could not withhold from the children of a brother ſhe ſo tenderly loved.</p>
            <p>Mr. Eaſy ſeldom reſided any length of time together in London, when he did, he had lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in St. James's ſtreet, but as his brother was now in town, apartments were prepared for him in Berkley ſquare.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Devenport's arrival in town was ſoon known by her numerous acquaintance, who were all eager to pay their reſpect to her; her time was ſo fully employed in receiving and paying viſits, that ſhe found herſelf totally una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to purſue her uſual domeſtic employments. She therefore intimated to them, that as ſhe came to London ſolely for the purpoſe of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing maſters for her children, it was not her intention to launch out into all the diſſipations of a gay life. Theſe hints had a deſired effect, and Mrs. Davenport ſoon began to find her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed pleaſure in inſpecting the education of her children. She had engaged a governeſs for them, and had taken no ſmall pains and trouble to procure one in whom ſhe could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide.</p>
            <p>This was a mortifying ſtroke to Sophia and Amelia; they had at firſt thought their aunt meant to take the care of their education en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely upon herſelf, without the aſſiſtance of a governeſs. This idea had given them much
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:034505_0135_0FFE0AF3C3343C78"/>pleaſure, as they concluded that in London ſhe would find but little time to attend to them.</p>
            <p>But how were they undeceived when Mrs. Davenport told them ſhe had engaged Mrs. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win to be always with them, and to ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their leſſons when ſhe was forced to abſent herſelf from home. Still, however, they were not without hope, this governeſs might prove more ignorant than themſelves, or if this were not the caſe, perhaps they ſhould be able to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon her, coax her into compliance with their idle fits, or elſe lead her ſuch a life as would induce her to leave the ſituation. But when this lady came, before ſhe had been one week in the houſe, they found that none of theſe ſchemes were likely to ſucceed.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Elwin proved to be a perſon every way qualified for the charge ſhe had undertaken. Having had much experience in the education of young people, ſhe had acquirrd a degree of penetration that enabled her to diſcover the ſource of all their actions; and as ſhe never ſuffered a bad trait to paſs unnoticed, Sophia and Amelia, notwithſtanding the plans they had concerted together, began to find it neceſſary to attend a little to their behaviour.</p>
            <p>Their ſchool began in the morning at ſeven; eight was their breakfaſt hour; from that time till ten, the muſic maſter attended Sophia and
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:034505_0136_0FFE0AB88073EBC8"/>Amelia on Mondays, Wedneſdays and Fridays; Mary and Caroline on the intervening days; on Tueſdays, Thurſdays, and Saturdays, whilſt their couſins were employed with their muſic maſter, Sophia and Amelia took leſſons in drawing.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Davenport joined them at ten, when Mrs. Elwin aſſiſted her in inſtructing them in hiſtory and geography. At one, the carriage was always ready to ſet them down in Hyde Park, or if the ground was very damp, to take them airing. At three they returned home to practiſe on the harpſichord, and dreſs for din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which was ſerved at four o'clock to Mrs. Elwin and her four pupils. After dinner they read French and Italian, and learnt to dance. At eight they left their governeſs, and went to drink tea with the reſt of the family with whom they ſtaid till ten, when (after prayers) they went to bed.</p>
            <p>Sophia and Amelia were by no means pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this arrangement of their time; it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired too much application to ſtudy to meet with their approbation, and the opinion they entertained of their new governeſs, may be gathered from the following anecdote:</p>
            <p>When this lady had been with them about a fortnight, Mrs. Davenport went out of town for a few days; it was during her abſence that Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:034505_0137_0FFE0AF913A1C1C0"/>was one night kept awake by a violent tooth-ache. Upon examining her mouth, Mrs. Elwin found it neceſſary to have immediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to a dentiſt; ſhe accordingly ordered the carriage, leaving Mary and the two Miſs Eaſys ſome French hiſtory to get by heart. In about two hours ſhe returned with Caroline in high ſpirits, having, upon the loſs of her tooth, found herſelf entirely freed from pain. Mary immediately ſaid her leſſon perfectly, but her couſins had only learnt a few lines, and thoſe very imperfectly.</p>
            <p>Upon inquiry, Mrs. Elwin found that they had been out of the ſchool-room moſt of the time ſhe was abſent, and as this was ſtrictly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, ſhe thought it requiſite to know what they had been about. Obſerving ink upon Sophia's fingers, ſhe knew they muſt have been writing, and in order to diſcover what, and to whom, ſhe queſtioned them very cloſely; but they both affirmed they had not had a pen in their 05 hands. At this moment one of the houſemaids entered the room with a letter in her hand, which ſhe gave to Sophia, ſaying at the ſame time, "John ſays, Ma'am, that the man at the poſt-office ſays that the letter is above weight, and John wants to know if he is to pay for it."</p>
            <p>Mrs. Elwin told the maid ſhe need not wait,
<pb facs="unknown:034505_0138_0FFE0ABA0827EFB8"/>
               <figure/>
               <pb n="139" facs="unknown:034505_0139_0FFE0AFA99BE8F98"/>and taking the paper from Sophia, broke it open: it was addreſſed to a young lady who had been her great friend at ſchool, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the following lines:</p>
            <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
               <body>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>"Dear T—,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>"After my promiſe to correſpond with you, you have been, no doubt, much ſurpriſed at my never having written; but you muſt know I am ſo watched, that I have found it impoſſible till this moment, when one of my Arguſſes is in the country, the other attending one of my <hi>ſweet little couſins</hi> to have a tooth pulled out."</p>
                  <p>"You know when I left the den at Q—e S—e, I expected to be a little more at lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, but lo, and <hi>behold,</hi> three days after our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival at the Hanover Square manſion, and odd kind of a ſtiff quizzical looking creature was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to us upon our return home from a walk, as our governeſs.—<hi>Governeſs,</hi> thought I; why, ſurely, our good Mrs. Davenport is ſufficiently vigilent without the aſſiſtance of another Duen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na; but my thoughts were little to the purpoſe; one ſpy, it ſeems, is not enough, and another we have. But this is not all, this Mrs. Elwin has introduced many deteſtable practices, ſuch as confining her pupils on back-boards, collars, ſtocks, &amp;c. As for me, it ſurpriſed me not a little to be meaſured for a back-board. You
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:034505_0140_0FFE0ABBA3F4DD50"/>know I leſt mine in Q—e S—e, where I and Mrs. S. have had many a good battle about it; but to be meaſured for a new one!— I'll be hang'd if I had not a great mind to knock her brains out with it when it came home. I did contrive to flounce it down on the hearth the ſecond day, and nearly broke her toes; for ſhe ſits cloſe to the fire, though we are to keep on the oppoſite ſide of the room, the <hi>ſweet couſins</hi> and all, <hi>who like it of all things.</hi> Upon my word, it would poſitively make you ſick to ſee us in our ſchool, as the Duennas are pleaſed to call it. Cloſe to the fender ſits kind Mrs. Elwin oppoſite to her, our tender hearted aunt; then comes a huge table loaded with French, Italian and Engliſh grammars, delightful trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes on geography, hiſtory, and <hi>I don't know what all;</hi> then, on four high ſtools, Amelia, myſelf, <hi>ſleek ſenſible Mary,</hi> and <hi>elegant little Caroline,</hi> ſit perched like the four candles on the ball-room chimney piece in Q—e S—e. But this does not laſt long, for we have little to learn by heart, but a good deal of <hi>deſk-work</hi> (as you call it) ſuch as making extracts from hiſtory, copying maps, writing down the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and longitude of places I never heard of before, and never wiſh to do again; then we tranſlate French and Italian, and the duce knows what all. By the bye, I return you your
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:034505_0141_0FFE0AFC2255E2F0"/>paper of riddles, for I do believe riddles would be a prophanation in this houſe, where we are all ſo mighty learned. Would you believe it, I had a half an hour's lecture for tying up my garters the other day while we were kneeling at prayers in the ſchool-room? For my part I thought it a mighty good opportunity, but our good governeſs thought otherwiſe, and talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much about what my <hi>duty</hi> was, and how much I ought at thoſe times to think of what I was about, that ſhe poſitively made me ſick.</p>
                  <p>"Amelia deſires me to tell you to give the incloſed letter to her croney, Lady Suſan T—, when you ſee her, and deſire her not to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it.</p>
                  <p>I wiſh I were in your caſe; you have left ſchool, and are to <hi>come out</hi> next year; as for me, 'tis true I am younger, but I don't ſee why I am not to <hi>come out</hi> at ſixteen as well as you; inſtead of that, I am to be immured up with theſe naſty Davenports till nineteen, when I promiſe you I will play ſine pranks in ſpite of paſt lectures. Did you ever ſee dumb-bells? They are great lumps of lead incloſed in leath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which we poor nuns are made to hold in our hands, and ſwing backwards and forwards, to open the cheſt, as they ſay; and this ſlaviſh
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:034505_0142_0FFE0AC0EFAB7DC0"/>taſk is ſet us when any of our maſters don't come to their hour. I can tell you, 'tis well for all their ſkulls that theſe weights are faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to my wriſts. They ſay they do it leſt they ſhould fall on my toes; but I'll be hanged if they don't ſuſpect me. A propos of maſters, that old quiz ******, is ſtill our dancing maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; he is the moſt ridiculous, provoking, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied animal I ever knew, except ſome peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whoſe names you may gueſs. But I ſhall not have time to ſeal my letter before Cerberus comes home, if I do not now ſign myſelf</p>

            <p>The letter incloſed in the above was much in the ſame ſtrain. Mrs. Elwin read them over cooly. The ſarcaſms thrown out againſt her gave her much leſs pain than the principles from which they proceeded. When ſhe had finiſhed the peruſal of them, ſhe leiſurely folded them up, and put them in her pocket, deſiring Sophia and Amelia to finiſh their leſſons, and forbidding Mary or Caroline to hold any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with their couſins till Mrs. Davenport returned, to whom ſhe intended to refer the matter. Sophia and Amelia looked mighty ſilly upon this diſcovery being made of their ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſtill more ſo, when their aunt came
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:034505_0143_0FFE0B0031EFE7B0"/>home the next day. As they had committed an unpardonable fault in writing letters unknown to Mrs. Elwin, this affair was not to be paſſed over with ſlight admonition; eſpecially as Mrs. Davenport had long obſerved that their diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions could be wrought on more by ſeverity than gentle means.</p>
            <p>They were accordingly ſentenced to be ſhut up for a fortnight in ſeparate rooms, in all which time they were only to be ſeen or ſpoken to by their governeſs: nor were they to be idle during this confinement; they read to Mrs. Elwin, and had ſuch extracts to get by heart, as were calculated to convince them of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety of their conduct.</p>
            <p>Upon the expiration of a fortnight, their annt gave each of them a letter, in anſwer to the two that had been intercepted. In theſe epiſtles (written by Mr. Davenport) arguments were offered that tended to ſhow the ingratitude and folly of turning into ridicule methods taken for our improvement by thoſe who are kind en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough to intereſt themſelves in our welfare.</p>
            <p>Sophia and Amelia were much ſtruck with theſe arguments, and I feel peculiar ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in aſſuring my readers their relations had never again any great cauſe to be diſpleaſed
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:034505_0144_0FFE0AC276177538"/>with them. They were not incorrigible, their hearts were at the bottom good, and the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of eradicating thoſe weeds that had ſo long choaked up their nobler ſentiments, fell to the lot of Mrs. Davenport, who well deſerved this reward for her care and attention.</p>
