            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE entrance of Emmanuel into our world was firſt announc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an angel to ſome humble ſhepherds. "I bring you," ſaid the heavenly herald, "good tidings of great joy, which ſhall be to all people. For this day is born, in the city of David, a Saviour which is Chriſt the Lord—And ſuddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly hoſt, praiſing God, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Glory to God in the higheſt, and on earth peace, good will tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards men</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>When this ſermon was preached at New-Haven, the general diſtribution of the ſubject was thus introduced: "The ſubſtance of what will he offered to your conſideration, was delivered a few days ſince to an</hi> epiſcopal <hi>congregation, on occaſion of the celebration of the nativity of Chriſt. But it is equally applicable to the preſent occaſion</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>The holy COMMUNION.</hi>
                  </note>, <hi>and to profeſſor of all denominations.</hi>
               </note>."</p>
            <p>We will conſider, FIRST, the ſubject matter of this acclamation of the heavenly hoſt.</p>
            <p>SECONDLY, The foundation laid by the advent of the Saviour for the united acknowledgments of men and angels.</p>
            <p>THIRDLY, Recommend the ſpirit of his religion, the prevalence of which would be moſt happy for mankind on earth, and bring glory to God on high.</p>
            <p>FIRST, Of the ſubject matter of this acclamation.</p>
            <p>Here we may take a general ſurvey of the Chriſtian inſtitution, as a promulgation of peace to mankind in a ſtate of apoſtacy. They are repreſented as <hi>alienated, and enemies in their mind, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtrength, children of diſobedience,</hi> and conſequently <hi>of wrath.</hi> They therefore need reconciliation to God.—Nor leſs to one another. For unrenewed nature is thus deſcribed: <hi>Living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another; full of all unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, malignity, and deceit.</hi> The old man, in diſtinction from ſuch as are renewed in the ſpirit of their mind, is known by pride, jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:021783_0004_0FB74300ED38C840"/>
malice, revenge, and other unfriendly paſſions, the bane of ſociety, the ſource of private animoſities and national wars. And even thoſe who have put off the old, and put on the new man, having remains of human depravity, experience and manifeſt more or leſs of the carnal mind, which is enmity. "All have gone out of the way. There is not a juſt man who doth good, and ſinneth not."</p>
            <p>THE exiſtence of the above alienation hath been, and is manifeſt over all the earth: It is ſuppoſed in all thoſe ſcriptures which ſpeak of <hi>reconciliation for iniquity,</hi> and repreſent Jeſus Chriſt as <hi>our peace,</hi> coming into the world, and enduring the croſs to reſtore peace on earth. God made man upright. He hath fallen from original rectitude. His glory is departed from him.</p>
            <p>THE peace celebrated by angels, as in the text, denotes, firſt, peace with GOD. He is reconciling the world to himſelf, not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting their treſſpaſſes. He proclaimeth peace through Jeſus Chriſt, who knew no ſin, and whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation for it, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him. It is to the glory of God's <hi>grace,</hi> that he maketh us accepted in the beloved. He firſt loved us, or no mediator would have been provided. Hence the ranſom Jeſus paid is the <hi>effect,</hi> not the <hi>cauſe</hi> of the love of God. In this greateſt gift of the Father's love, grace ſuperabounds where ſin abounded.</p>
            <p>IN the parable of the prodigal ſon, the father met the profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate while a great way off; fell on his neck, and kiſſed him; put the beſt robe on him, and a ring on his finger, and ſhoes on his feet, receiving him with every mark of paternal affection and joy. <hi>Such</hi> is the divine condeſcenſion and compaſſion to wandering, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing ſinners. "He that ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things?" Let the glory of his grace be celebrated by heaven and earth. For if God be for us, who ſhall be againſt us? No tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation can happen to us above that we are able. All things ſhall work together for good. Should any injure us in our outward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, it will not be in their power to deprive us of the ſpecial
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:021783_0005_0FB74304457212D0"/>
protection and ſmiles of a reconciled God. If not reconciled to him, what power can deliver us from his hand who is able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy ſoul and body? Whom then would you fear? with whom would you be at peace?</p>
            <p>FURTHER: The ſacrifice of Jeſus was a <hi>voluntary</hi> one. The Meſſiah, having a body prepared for him, "gave himſelf an offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſacrifice to God, and put away ſin by the ſacrifice of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Lo, I come—I delight to do thy will, O my God. There is one Mediator between God and men, the man Chriſt Jeſus, who gave himſelf a ranſom for all." How wonderful his friendſhip! "Though he was rich, for our ſakes he became poor, that we through his poverty might be rich. Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his <hi>friends.</hi> But "when we were <hi>enemies,</hi> we were reconciled to God by the death of his ſon."</p>
            <p>CONSIDER how great HE was who undertook our redemption, and you cannot doubt but he was able to heal the breach the apoſtacy had made. Call to mind on this occaſion the character given of him in prophecy. "Unto us a child is born, unto us a ſon is given, and the government ſhall be upon his ſhoulders: And his name ſhall be called, WONDERFUL, COUNSELLER, THE MIGHTY GOD, THE EVERLASTING FATHER, THE PRINCE OF PEACE." He who was "ſet up from everlaſting, by whom all things were made and conſiſt," whoſe "glory was that of the only begotten of the Father, HE was made fleſh. The word, who was God," became incarnate: <hi>God was manifeſt in the fleſh</hi>—This is a plain declaration of his divinity and humanity. Thus the prophet who foretold his miraculous conception: "Behold, a virgin ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and bear a ſon, and ſhall call his name EMMANUEL." If ſuch is the character of our redeemer, who will queſtion but he is <hi>mighty to ſave?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FURTHER: The peace here proclaimed includes peace and good will among <hi>men.</hi> The example of our heavenly Father inſtructs us to love our enemies, bleſs them that curſe us, and do good to them that hate us. Our own forgiveneſs is expreſsly ſuſpended
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:021783_0006_0FB743056B621058"/>
on our imitation of the divine example. As a motive to ſuch imitation, a compariſon is made of our offences againſt God with thoſe of our fellow-men againſt us. The former are ſaid to be to the latter as ten thouſand talents to an hundred pence. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the author of our faith is a further motive to the exerciſe of forgiveneſs. Theſe are examples which can never be paralleled. Were we "followers of God as dear children;" did we "walk in love as Chriſt hath loved us," we ſhould "put away all bitterneſs, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil-ſpeaking, with all malice, and be kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another." The peculiar characteriſtics of <hi>the wiſdom from above</hi> are theſe: "Firſt, pure, then peaceable, gentle, and eaſy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocriſy." Thoſe whom the Saviour pronounceth bleſſed, are, <hi>the poor in ſpirit, the meek, the merciful, the peace-makers,</hi> ſuch as can bear to be <hi>reviled and perſecuted for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs' ſake;</hi> ſuch as forgive injuries to <hi>ſeventy times ſeven;</hi>—who do not wait till the injurious aſk reconciliation, but prevent them by unſolicited propoſals of it, in imitation of the divine example. Did the principles and maxims of benevolence, inculcated by our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, rule in men's hearts, all unworthy emulations, all animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and bitterneſs would ceaſe. The members of a family, neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, civil or religious community would be <hi>of one heart and ſoul.</hi> The ſpirit of Chriſtianity "beareth, hopeth, believeth all things, thinketh no evil, ſeeketh not her own, envieth not, vaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not itſelf, is not puffed up." It worketh no ill to its neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; doth good to all as it hath opportunity; and, if poſſible, lives peaceably with all men.</p>
            <p>This may be <hi>impoſſible.</hi> For ſome men would wreſt from others the liberty of judging and acting for themſelves, in a matter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in every one muſt ſtand or fall to his own maſter, being account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able only to the ſearcher of hearts. When men make their own ſentiments the terms of ſalvation, it may be impoſſible to be on good terms with them, and yet have peace with God and their own conſciences.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:021783_0007_0FB74306E352E860"/>
THERE doubtleſs are real Chriſtians in all communions, whether different communions acknowledge it, or not. In the exercſe of Chriſtian charity the queſtion is not to what claſs of profeſſors a perſon belongs, but whether he is a real member of that kingdom which is righteouſneſs and peace. Profeſſors may agree by love to ſerve one another, and unite their intereſt for the advancement of the kingdom of their common maſter, while they are beſt edified by a diverſity of forms, have different views of ſome revealed truths, and different apprehenſions as to ſome of the ways whereby Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity may be beſt advanced. If, on account of ſuch differences, or any of a like nature, they ſeparate each other from the body of Chriſt, they <hi>know not what they do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE church of Chriſt, in its extenſive boundaries, needs the gifts of all the parts into which it is divided, and of every individ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual of each denomination, as the natural body needs the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of all its members, in order to its beauty, health and growth. "For as the body is one, and hath many mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and all members have not the ſame office, <hi>ſo alſo is Chriſt.</hi>" Hence it ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes any denomination of Chriſtians to aſſume the whole honour of ſupporting Chriſtianity, or the reformation, even ſuppoſe they may be viewed as eminent defenders of both. And it would as ill become any denomination to ſuppoſe their own weight and influence ſo inconſiderable, that it is of little conſequence how they demean themſelves. Various denominations ſhould conſider themſelves, and treat each other, as ſeverally and jointly ſubſervient to the cauſe of the ſame Lord. They ſhould excite each other to a laudable emulation, that through their united influence the goſpel may have free courſe.</p>
            <p>"LET every man be fully perſuaded in his own mind. Why doſt thou judge thy brother?" Had this advice been followed, the religion of the prince of peace would never have been improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as an inſtrument of diſcord and war. This was a conſequence, an undeſigned conſequence, of its eſtabliſhment. As its author

foretold, it ſeparated neareſt friends, and proved an occaſion of the ſharpeſt conteſts. This came to paſs, however, through the ignorance, prejudices and luſts of men: It was not the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of a right underſtanding of the goſpel, or of men's having the ſpirit it inculcates; but the reverſe. Peace on earth, good will among men, are the legitimate fruits of this religion. Under its influence the ſtate of this world would be that which we are taught to expect when "the knowledge of the Lord ſhall fill the earth: They ſhall not hurt nor deſtroy in all God's holy moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain."</p>
            <p>RELIGION muſt be maintained under ſome form. This is indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible to the welfare of communities. In this view it will be the care of the magiſtrate who ſeeks the good of his people: At the ſame time it is the unalienable right of every individual to chuſe his own way of worſhip. Particular forms do not open the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven to men, nor ſhut that kingdom againſt them. "If any man have not the ſpirit of Chriſt, he is none of his." Whoever hath this ſpirit, is an heir of ſalvation. Shame to the charity of ſuch as will not allow it!—</p>
            <p>WE have but one rule by which to judge whether men are Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>by their fruits.</hi> And the fruits of Chriſtianity are "love joy, peace, long-ſuffering gentleneſs, goodneſs, faith, meekneſs, temperance." Perfect unity in <hi>ſentiment</hi> among the profeſſors of the ſame religion is impoſſible. They may yet be one in <hi>affection</hi>—may "keep the unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace," as the diſciples of <hi>one Lord,</hi> who <hi>are called in one hope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THOSE who have ſuch confidence in their own conſtruction of the ſcriptures as to make it neceſſary to all Chriſtians, have much occaſion to conſider our Lord's words reſpecting ſuch as ſaid, "Lo, here is Chriſt; or lo, he is there;" that is, here or there only. Our Lord ſaid, "Go not after them; nor follow them." Hence we infer, either that they had not his preſence with them; or if they had, they yet knew not what ſpirit they were of in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:021783_0009_0FB742E757861840"/>
his preſence to be with others: Herein at leaſt they may not be imitated. This is a diſtinguiſhing mark of the Romiſh church; and it is doubtful whether infallibility itſelf can ſupport the excluſive claim. For if her infallibility be not proved and known to <hi>others</hi> as well as <hi>herſelf,</hi> are others obliged to admit her faith? What effect hath it on that peace and good will which Chriſtianity inculcates? on brotherly kindneſs and charity? Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare Saul of Tarſus, making havoc of the church, with Paul the meek and humble apoſtle of Jeſus, going every where in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the bleſſing of the goſpel of peace. Thus the goſpel, thro' divine operation, takes from men the ſpirit of ſelf-ſufficiency, and gives them a better mind.</p>
            <p>OUR Lord rebuked the ſpirit of the diſciples who would have called for fire from heaven on the Samaritan village. The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans would not receive him, becauſe he was going to Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem. The diſciples wiſhed that the Samaritans might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly conſumed. In both there was doubtleſs a mixture of an old national enmity. But Jeſus came not to <hi>deſtroy,</hi> but to <hi>ſave.</hi> Nor may his diſciples conſign one another over to the divine wrath, becauſe they have not attained to think alike. By ſentiments of mutual reſpect, by imitating the virtues of their maſter, they would adorn the <hi>doctrine</hi> of our Saviour.</p>
            <p>IT muſt give one who hath the ſpirit of Chriſtianity an exalted pleaſure to be able to reflect, that his beſt endeavours have been uſed to promote the great end of the incarnation of Chriſt. Compare the pleaſures of Chriſtian benevolence, which thinks and hopes the beſt of all men, is kindly affectioned, and, with brotherly love, in honor preferreth others, while all within its reach are the better for it—compare the ſatisfaction ſuch an one hath in himſelf, with the ſpirit of bigotry and ſuſpicion—the ſpirit which abſolves or retains men's ſins according as they do or do not conform to us—the ſpirit which loves, and doth good to thoſe only of <hi>one</hi> deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. The former are <hi>perfect as our Father in Heaven.</hi> The

            <p>LASTLY, the peace our ſubject mentions includes peace in our <hi>conſciences.</hi> The diſciple of Jeſus hath "joy and peace in believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and abounded in hope by the power of the Holy Ghoſt." This is called "the love of God ſhed abroad in the heart"—"the witneſs of the ſpirit of God with theirs, that they the are children of God"—"the earneſt of the ſpirit in their hearts." Hence their "fellowſhip is with the Father and Son." This "peace which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth underſtanding," is doubtleſs comprehended in the peace for which the angelic hoſts celebrated the praiſe of the MOST HIGH at the nativity of Chriſt. "Becauſe ye are ſons, God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father." To accompliſh the end of his death, Jeſus ſent the Spirit after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to heaven, for the conviction and converſion of unbelievers, and the confirmation and joy of believers unto life, that they might <hi>go on to perfection.</hi> The deſign of the diſpenſation of grace thro' a Mediator is thus expreſſed: "The loftineſs of man ſhall be bowed down, and the haughtineſs of men ſhall be made low: and the Lord alone ſhall be exalted in that day." When this deſign is effected, through the power of the Spirit with the word, the alien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the ſinner is deſtroyed. He commenceth an object of the ſpecial love of God, an heir of ſalvation. He "hath put off the old, and put on the new man." In the eternal counſel of peace it pleaſed the Father to reconcile all things to himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt. The covenant of peace was between them. The chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our peace was upon him. God now cond<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>nds to beſeech ſinners to accept reconciliation in Chriſt. The ſum of our miniſtry is this: "Be ye reconciled to God." Angels miniſter
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:021783_0011_0FB74317E76A9F38"/>
to men for this end. And the eternal Spirit operates with the means of grace. Hence "the weapons of our warfare are mighty to the pulling down of ſtrong holds." Not by human exertions; "but by my Spirit, ſaith the Lord." The excellency of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is of God, that no fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence. What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the ſon of man, that thou viſiteſt him?"</p>
            <p>WE proceed to remark, SECONDLY, the foundation laid, by the advent of a Saviour, for the united acknowledgments of men and angels.</p>
            <p>THE ſubject of the united adoration and gratitude of the heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enly hoſt at the nativity of Chriſt was this: <hi>Glory to God in the higheſt, and on earth peace, good will towards men.</hi> Let earth join with heaven in this acclamation. Join in it this day, ye who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the preſent ſolemnity in commemoration of the birth of Chriſt. Ye who believe it to be the birth-day of your eternal hopes. So illuſtrious a perſonage was never born into our world—one ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be remembered—one whom all men are commanded to honour, even as they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Father.</p>
            <p>WHETHER other worlds have fallen, and had a Redeemer provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? or how far the angelic hoſt, who here celebrate the birth of the Redeemer of mankind, are intereſted in his redemption? are queſtions which do not affect the preſent ſubject, nor do at all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to us. It is ſufficient that we know there is peace on earth through the interpoſition of the Saviour, Chriſt the Lord—that ſuperior intelligences give glory to God in the higheſt for this, and intereſt themſelves in what ſo nearly concerns us. They were never alienated from God. They have always done his will with alacrity and zeal. Perfect harmony and love have reigned among them. They rejoice that peace is proclaimed to our fallen race, and deſire to look into the ſcheme of man's redemption: It is the ſubject of their adoration. There is joy among theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent ſpirits at the converſion of every ſinner on earth. They
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:021783_0012_0FB743220F990EA8"/>
cheerfully miniſter for this purpoſe, that rebels may be reclaimed, and recovered ſinners trained up to join them in the exerciſes and enjoyments of the world of perfect purity and love.</p>
            <p>SHALL heaven be full of joy and praiſe, that God hath ſent his Son to our redemption? and ſhall rebels and apoſtates be indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the proclamation of pardon, peace and glory? Is God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious? Will he accept repentance? Has he laid help on one that is mighty? Are the glad tidings publiſhed to us? Doth the offended majeſty of heaven offer us full pardon unſolicited; and even intreat us to lay down our weapons of rebellion? Is he long-ſuffering, not willing that any ſhould periſh? Is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of peace unlimited, ſo that whoſoever will may ſhare in it? What ſhall we ſay? "Bleſs the Lord, O our ſouls! and all that is within us, bleſs his holy name." For he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered us in our low eſtate. "The day ſpring from on high hath viſited us, and the ſun of righteouſneſs riſen upon us, to guide our feet in the way of peace. Sing, O ye heavens, for the Lord hath done it; ſhout ye lower parts of the earth: break forth into ſinging ye mountains, O foreſt, and every tree therein: for the Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and glorified himſelf in Iſrael, Bleſſed are the people who know the joyful ſound: They ſhall walk, O Lord, in the light of thy countenance. In thy name ſhall they rejoice all the day; and in thy righteouſneſs ſhall they be exalted."</p>
            <p>BUT redemption ſhould be imprinted on our <hi>hearts,</hi> as well as celebrated with our tongues. What would be our obligations for deliverance from formidable outward enemies; from ſlavery, priſon and death; and reſtoration to freedom and eligible circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances? From the abundance of our hearts we ſhould ſeek op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to teſtify our gratitude to our deliverer, and endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, by every means to ſecure his friendſhip. Are our obligations leſs for deliverance from the ſlavery of ſin, from the hoſts and priſon of hell; reſtoration to the glorious liberty of the ſons of God? Are our obligations leſs for eternal redemption? Had

not meſſages of ſalvation been brought from heaven to earth by the Son of God in our nature, muſt we not have joined with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning angels, "Fartheſt from God is beſt." How beautiful, then, upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publiſheth peace, that bringeth good tidings of good, that publiſheth ſalvation, that faith upon Zion, thy God reigneth."</p>
            <p>IF it be aſked, What evidence have we that there was ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as Jeſus born in the city of David, at the time we ſuppoſe; who taught lived, and performed ſuch works as never man did, died on the croſs, and rose to immortal life? Our anſwer is the ſame evidence as we have for the exiſtence of any conſpicuous charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in antient hiſtory. Yea, more, if poſſible: For beſides the teſtimonies of Chriſtian, Jewiſh and Pagan hiſtorians to the life of Jeſus, the accompliſhment of his prophecies in all ages ſince, and before the face of all people, undeniably proves, not only that there was ſuch an illuſtrious character at that time, but alſo that he was <hi>ſent of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE temple and city of Jeruſalem were laid in ruins about ſeventeen hundred years ago, and have never been rebuilt, though Jews and heathen have united their efforts to defeat the prophecy of this deſolation. The choſen people have ever ſince been ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered over the face of the earth, and yet preſerved as a diſtinct people; alike diſtinguiſhed by univerſal approbrium, and by their malignity to the author of Chriſtianity. Conſider their ſtate at preſent, and ever ſince their deſolation. Were theſe things fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, and have they come to paſs, without the determinate counſel and providence of God? Hath this unexampled chaſtiſement befallen them, becauſe they added to their other crimes this above all, that they crucified the LORD OF GLORY? Let ſuch in the preſent age as deny the Lord that bought them, be warned. Let them ſeek refuge in that Saviour whom they have pierced by their infidelity and other crimes. For <hi>there is no more ſacrifice for ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF the whole hiſtory of Jeſus is denied, let them ſhew in what

               <hi>age,</hi> in what <hi>country,</hi> and by <hi>whom</hi> his religion was firſt introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—and by what <hi>means</hi> it was eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>THIRDLY, It was propoſed to recommend the benevolent ſpirit of Chriſtianity, the prevalence of which would be moſt happy for mankind on earth, and bring glory to God on high.</p>
            <p>ST. PAUL inculcates Chriſtian union on the primitive converts by ſuch conſiderations as theſe<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. XIV. <hi>paſſim,</hi> and chap. XV. 1—7.</note>. All profeſſions are alike entitled to, and bound to exerciſe, private judgement. Thoſe who have the moſt improved knowledge in Chriſtianity ſhould bear with the prejudices of ſuch as are leſs informed, and not pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. All being accountable at the tribunal of God, all ſhould beware left they invade his prerogative, by excluding their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-diſciplies from his mercy, becauſe of different opinions on unimportant points. A convention for forms ſhould never be ſo maintained as to bring into neglect and reproach things commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and even eſſential to all chriſtians. For the moſt ſpecious profeſſors are nothing, if they have not charity, Hence a regard to the common cauſe of Chriſtianity, the purity and extenſion of it, the union and edification of its diſciples, ſhould govern all who aſſume the profeſſion. For <hi>no man liveth to himſelf.</hi> By ſuch conſiderations as theſe doth the apoſtle exhort to brotherly love—to peace with all men, and holineſs. On what other terms can we enjoy the God of peace, or the ſociety above who are made <hi>perfect in love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE unexampled inſtance of humility and charity exhibited by the Lord of glory, when he took our nature upon him, inculcates on all his followers the moſt unſeigned and fervent love to one another, and to mankind of every nation. This ſpirit renders <hi>the righteous man more excellent than his neighbour.</hi> Thoſe eſpecially have engaged to cultivate and diſplay it, who have <hi>fellowſhip in breaking of bread and prayer,</hi> in that inſtitution which is the body and blood of Chriſt. Different denominations of profeſſors, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the influence of this ſpirit, will unite their endeavours for the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:021783_0015_0FB7433295E4EB60"/>
purity and extenſion of the Chriſtian religion, rejoicing in each other's gifts, and in the peace of the church.</p>
            <p>IS this mind in us? Then our good wiſhes and earneſt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers embrace men of every communion, nation and character; at the ſame time we feel a peculiar complacence in ſuch as appear to have the ſpirit of Chriſt, whether they are of our perſuaſion or not; whether near or remote; our own countrymen or foreigners. With all ſuch we ſhall moſt cheerfully unite in the propagation of the goſpel.</p>
            <p>St. Paul has given us a particular deſcription of charity, 1 Cor. XIII. This is <hi>the more excellent way</hi> mentioned at the concluſion of chapter XII. Whoever compares the two chapters will plainly ſee, that <hi>ſchiſm</hi> is the oppoſite to charity. The ſchiſmatic div<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ides the body of Chriſt: The ſpirit of charity unites it. Schiſm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atics eſtabliſh this rule for the exciſion of members:—We our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are <hi>always</hi> right: They who <hi>differ</hi> from us are <hi>wrong;</hi> and therefore to be excluded from the communion of ſaints.</p>
            <p>OUR Lord forewarned his diſciples, that they would meet with like treatment as he had, and by his own behaviour taught them a proper temper under it. "Who did no ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth: Who when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he ſuffered, he threatened not; but committed himſelf to him that judgeth righteouſly. Leaving us an example, that ye ſhould follow his ſteps. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own; but becauſe ye are not of the world, therefore the world hateth you," The Chriſtian therefore muſt lay his account to ſuffer wrongfully from the world. He forfeits his character, if he doth not arm himſelf with the ſame mind as was in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>who endured the contradiction of ſinners.</hi> A true diſciple will ſhew much condeſcenſion for <hi>the goſpel's ſake,</hi> that oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers may partake of its bleſſings with him. He will be patient in tribulation. He will walk in wiſdom towards them that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. He will take care that there be no occaſion of ſtumbling in
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:021783_0016_0FB74333DDEE2F88"/>
him. Is this attended to by thoſe who are pertinacious and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate about <hi>meat and drink</hi>—the peculiarities of any one denomination; while <hi>righteouſneſs and peace,</hi> the eſſentials of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, are ſacrificed?</p>
            <p>THE Chriſtian will indeed obey God rather than men, though men ſhould perſecute him for obeying the dictates of his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. At the ſame time he will endeavour to recommend his profeſſion to all men, by ſhewing them, that LOVE, divine and ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, is more than whole burnt-offerings and ſacrifices—that <hi>faith worketh by love.</hi> Under the commanding influence of this ſpirit, a fondneſs for diſcriminating terms would be forgotten in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon concern for Chriſtianity, and a common exertion againſt its foes. Thus our Lord prayed for his diſciples. "That they all may be one, as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee; that they alſo may be one in us: <hi>that the world may believe that thou haſt ſent me.</hi>" There would be no jar in families, no ſchiſm in churches, no tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults in the ſtate, were the ſpirit of Chriſtianity imbibed. Dom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtic tranquility and love would bleſs every houſe, alleviating ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery care, conſoling under every ſorrow, giving a reliſh to every en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment. Kindred would be knit together, as David and Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than. Neighbours would be as brethren. It would be with king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms as in the natural body, in which "the members have the ſame care one of another." Numerous as they are, and however various their office, "the eye doth not ſay to the hand, I have no need of thee; nor the head to the feet, I have no need of you. Thoſe members which ſeem to be more feeble are neceſſary." Under the influence of this ſpirit, nations would <hi>learn war no more.</hi> All would be content with their own rights, and fulfil their duty to others. Whatever different apprehenſions there might be, any ill effects therefrom would be prevented. Yea, theſe would but diſplay the Chriſtian ſpirit to better advantage. The earth would be like heaven. What glory would be brought to God on high from the univerſal prevalence of this ſpirit! What ſhall we ſay more to recommend it?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:021783_0017_0FB7433EC5482470"/>
How much then is it to be lamented, that the ſpirit of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity has been departed from in all times and places, by thoſe who have profeſſed a zeal for it? What cauſe have we to lay our hand upon our heart, and be deeply humbled that we are ſo prone to animadvert with ſeverity on every miſtake and treſpaſs of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; while God in Chriſt is ever ready to bury in eternal oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our numberleſs and aggravated offences, and proclaimeth peace to all mankind? Dare we indulge hatred againſt another, while we glory in this, that the Son of the bleſſed was born into our world, and endured the croſs, to make reconciliation for our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities? Shall we look for mercy from God, and yet ſuffer one ſun after another to go down upon our wrath againſt our brother? yea, one year after another to roll over, and our reſentment to continue unabated? Thoſe of whom this may be ſaid, do not ſurely give the beſt evidence that they themſelves are reconciled to God. In the day of judgment we ſhall all have infinite need of mercy. Our hope that we ſhall then find it, depends much on our loving mercy. <hi>The merciful ſhall obtain mercy.</hi> Why then has peace been taken from the church and world, under pretence of <hi>contending for the faith?</hi> The conſequence of obedience to the faith would be, as we have ſeen, peace on earth, and good will among men. To this end Chriſt was born and came into the world. To this end he both died and revived.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Many</hi> rejoiced at the birth of John, becauſe he prepared the way of the Lord. But the birth of Chriſt is matter of higheſt joy to <hi>all people.</hi> For all the bleſſings of time and eternity are the purchaſe of his being made fleſh, and placing his delights with the ſons of men. "Bleſs the Lord, ye his angels, that excel in ſtrength; ye miniſters of his that do his pleaſure"—But why call on the <hi>angels?</hi> They ceaſe not day and night from celebrating the Redeemer. Unto you, therefore, O <hi>men!</hi> I call; and my voice is unto the ſons of men. With God there is plenteous red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption

He that is mighty hath done great things for our ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed race. He hath not withheld his own Son from us. The Son of the bleſſed "is our peace, having reconciled Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles unto God by the croſs, having ſlain the enmity thereby. Through him we have acceſs by one Spirit unto the Father." Joy to the world that Jeſus reigns! May each of our hearts be his throne.

            <p>EVERY intelligent and ſerious Chriſtian will diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a religious commemoration of the birth of Chriſt, and ſuch exceſſes as have been common on this occaſion. The Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian's joy in outward things is regulated by the rules of moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and the ſuperior rules of ſobriety and heavenly-mindedneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated by the precepts and life of Jeſus. He hath not forbid us to rejoice with our friends—to take our portion. But to rejoice in his ſalvation is to ſee our own neceſſities and his fulneſs; and to come to him as he inviteth all that labour and are heavy-laden, that we may find reſt to our ſouls. In him we ſhall have peace, if we take his yoke upon us and learn of him. May no light or extavagant joy ſtain the joy of this day.</p>
            <p>WERE his religion well underſtood and univerſally practiſed, all nations would be bleſſed in abundance of peace. Would we be uſeful to ſociety or ornaments in the church, would we enjoy our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and have peace with God, let us cordially embrace the faith of Chriſt, and live by it. So ſhall we rejoice and be glad all our days. It comes recommended to all ages, and to all orders. It is alike adapted to public and private ſtations, to high and low, rich and poor. Under its influence men will be faithful in little, and much; will poſſeſs the confidence of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the approbation of their own minds, and of him with whom they have to do. It ends in glory honor and immorality. Would to God that ſuch ſentiments, and correſpondent reſolutions, might be taken up on the preſent occaſion by old and young, and middleaged.</p>

            <p>INSTEAD of preſuming on years to come, let us determine to improve the preſent to the glory of God on high, and the good of men. Let us lay up in ſtore a good foundation againſt the time to come, by abiding in our callings, walking as God hath variouſly diſtributed to us. He that teacheth, let him attend con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually on this thing. He that ruleth, let it be with diligence, and as the miniſter of God for good. And let not thoſe who oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy a lower room, ſay, Becauſe I am not the eye or the head, I am not of the body. Let love be without diſſimulation. Not ſlothful in buſineſs; fervent in ſpirit; ſerving the Lord.</p>
            <p>When the devout Simeon, who waited for the conſolation of Iſrael, ſaw the infant Saviour, he ſaid, "Lord, now letteſt thou thy ſervant depart in peace." It will be the conſolation of every dark hour thro' life, and eſpecially of our laſt moments, if we love the Savior whom we have not ſeen—if we can aſſuredly ſay, <hi>I know whom I have believed, and that he is able to keep what I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him againſt that day, when he ſhall come in his kingdom.</hi>

            <head>Subſtance of a PRAYER offered up after Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, December 25, 1788. Publiſhed by particular Deſire.</head>
            <p>ALMIGHTY GOD, of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named! Angels and men have one Father. We joy in thee as the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. With the hoſt of heaven we give glory to the moſt high God, that thou haſt raiſed up an horn of ſalvation for us, in the houſe of thy ſervant David. Great is the myſtery of godlineſs: God was manifeſt in the fleſh, juſtified in the Spirit, ſeen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory. The glad tidings of great joy to all people, proclaimed at the Saviour's birth, have reached our ears, through the tender mercy of our God. Bleſſed are the people who know the joyful ſound.</p>
            <p>IMPRESS on our minds what we have heard concerning the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Prince of Peace, through whom pardon, grace and glory are publiſhed to a world of apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates. All the angels of God worſhip him. They are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by him as miniſtring ſpirits for the heirs of ſalvation. We would honour him even as we honour the Father.</p>
            <p>MAY profeſſors of different denominations unite in their endeavours to advance that kingdom which is not meat and drink, but righteouſneſs, and peace, and joy in the holy

Ghoſt. To this end may they be like-minded one towards another, according to Chriſt Jeſus; that with one mind and one mouth they may glorify God. Chriſt is not divided. There is one body, and one ſpirit, even as we are called in one hope. We have all one Father, even God; and one maſter, even Chriſt; and all we are brethren. May min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters and churches of every denomination adorn the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of our <hi>S</hi>aviour by a converſation becoming the goſpel, not ſeeking their own things, but thoſe of Jeſus Chriſt; above all things putting on charity, which is the bond of perfectneſs; rejoicing in the gifts, and contributing to the proficiency and uſefulneſs of one another, and to the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the univerſal Church. By caring for each other as members of one body, by keeping the unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace, and a common concern for the honour of the great head of the church, may they fulfil their duty to him, and one another, and the whole church, <hi>that there may be no ſchiſm in the body.</hi> The faith of our Lord Jeſus, the Lord of glory, is without reſpect to perſons, or forms of profeſſion. Grant, O Father, that all in every place, who call on his name, may ſtand faſt in one ſpirit, with one mind, ſtriving together for the faith of the goſpel. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>S</hi>aviour's prayer for his diſciples, may they all be one—that the world may know that thou haſt ſent him.</p>
            <p>REVIVE the languiſhing ſpirit of Chriſtianity among all who make profeſſion of it, and make known thy ſaving health to all nations. Root out of thy church every plant which thou our heavenly Father haſt not planted.</p>

MAY grace and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, be multiplied to the flock of God who uſually worſhip in this Sanctuary. May they remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how they have received the meſſages of ſalvation from their late worthy paſtor<note n="†" place="bottom">The Rev. SAMUEL ANDREWS, miſſionary at Wallingford, from the ſociety for the propagation of the goſpel, twenty-five years; removed to St. Andrews, New-Brunſwick, A. D. 1787.</note>, and hold faſt, and repent. We commend him and his family to the grace of God. Grant him more perfect and confirmed health. Protract his life and uſefulneſs. May the wilderneſs and ſolitary place be glad for the good tidings he may bring; and welcome him, ſaying, Bleſſed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord. Send labourers into that part of thine harveſt, who may go forth in the fullneſs of the bleſſing of the goſpel of peace.</p>
            <p>MAY the rules of Chriſtian ſobriety regulate the joy of this day, in this place and elſewhere. May nothing take place unbecoming the occaſion.</p>
            <p>TEACH us to rejoice in the Lord alway. May our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration be known to all men. The Lord is at hand. May the peace of God which paſſeth all underſtanding, keep our hearts and minds through Jeſus Chriſt; to whom with the Father and Holy Ghoſt be glory from all on earth and in heaveaven for evermore. AMEN.</p>
