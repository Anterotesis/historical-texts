            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>First, Of Preparation to Christianity.</head>
            <p n="1">1. YOu must look upon true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity to be of absolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, and an indispensable duty: you cannot live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, and you dare not die without it. Wo to you, if you die before you live; if you die to the world, before you live to God; and if you go out of the World, before Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ come into your heart: be sure that Christ be in you, so may he bring the hope of glory, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 27. and that you be in Christ, so must be broke off from the wild olive of the old <hi>Adam,</hi> Rom. 11. 24. which two makes up the true Christian.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You cannot attain to true Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, until you be born again, [or from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove] <hi>Joh.</hi>3. 3,5. until you can experience
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:000358_0004_0FA554CF737B5DF8"/>
the death and burial of the old <hi>Adam,</hi> and the Resurrection of the New. You must be unmade to sin, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. and then made up again for God. 'Tis not scraping the walls of the house of the fretting Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosie, that will serve the turn, <hi>Lev,</hi> 14. 14, 44. but all the Timber, and all the Stones thereof must be thrown down to the ground that a new building may be ercted in its stead.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Be sure, this can never be attained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til you come to a sound and saving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, both of your self and Christ: (1) Of the emptiness and vileness of your self, so as to deny, abhor and abandon your self; and (2) Of Christs excellency and all-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, so as to value him your all, and above all; Indeed a full Christ and a vile nothing creature agrees best together.</p>
            <p n="4">4. 'Twill be both your prudence and advantage to forbear the searching after the knowledg of other things, until you come to a solid knowledg of your self, which is the one thing needful in Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and whereof Heathenism had some rude notion; to know your self to be lost
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:000358_0005_0FA554D06D68B9B0"/>
in your self, and never found again till you be [Found] in Christ, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The more that you know your self, the greater will your self-abhorrency be, <hi>Job</hi> 42. 6. This will make you cry out with <hi>Augustine, [a malo homine</hi> [me ipso] <hi>libera me domine:</hi>] From that evil man (my self) Oh Lord, deliver me. You will find that though Satan be your great Enemy, yet your own sinful self is the worst: for Satan might strike fire long enough with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out success, if your own evil heart did not find him Tinder: the Tempter may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siege the City long enough to no purpose, if there were not a treacherous party with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that lets down the Draw-bridge, and sets open the Gates to his Troops of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations.</p>
            <p n="6">6. This knowledg of your self will bring also greater dis-satisfaction with your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent state and standing in wayes of unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy, with your being without God, &amp;- without Christ in the World; making you cry out not only Unclean, unclean; but also Undone, undone; give me Christ or I die, and that to all Eternity: I am condemned
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000358_0006_0FA554D2B3A680F0"/>
already, <hi>John.</hi> 3. 18. and the wrath of God abides upon me, <hi>v.</hi> 36. Oh, who dares live in an House that is haunted with evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits! or lodge in a Cave that abounds with noysome Toads and venemous Serpents! such and far worse is your lying in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renewed estate.</p>
            <p n="7">7. When you behold the avenger of blood, to wit, Divine Justice pursuing you at the heels, his heart being hot within him, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. 6. then it is high time for you to hasten to that blessed City of Refuge the most excellent and all-sufficient Lord Jesus, who was purposely provided of the Father, to be a Saviour and Sanctuary to save us both from present wrath, and from wrath to come also, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.10. He is that Name of the Lord which the righteous run [into] and are safe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.10.</p>
            <p n="8">8. In so doing, know for your incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, that the gates of the Sanctuary and City of Refuge shall not be shut against you. First, the place of Christs birth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages, which was an Inn: He was born in one <hi>of Bethlehem's</hi> Inns, a place that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives all comers; all guests that come are bid welcome.</p>

2. The posture of his death; Christ died upon the Cross with his Arms spread wide asunder, as in a posture ready to embrace all penitent sinners that come unto him, and fall into his arms. <hi>Him that cometh unto me, I will [in no wise] cast out, or keep out,</hi> Joh.6.37.</p>
            <p n="9">9. And though you cannot run, or come fast enough to Christ, yet Christ will come and run to you, and meet you better half way. While the penitent Prodigal did but [come] towards his Father, his Father ran to meet him, <hi>and had compassion upon him, and fell on his neck and kissed him,</hi> Luk.15 20. Christ will be much better to you, than you will or can be to your self; <hi>for he [can] have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way,</hi> Heb. 5. 2. and though you cannot bring your self to grace, yet grace is [brought] to you by Christ.</p>

            <head>2. Of Carriage under the first workings of Christianity.</head>
            <p n="1">1: When the Lord Jesus comes and stands knocking at the door of your heart, with the hammer of his word, and with the hand of his Spirit, then bow your self with

all your might (as <hi>Samson</hi> did) <hi>Judg.</hi> 16. 30. to pull back every bolt, and to draw in every bar, that would keep the door shut against this blessed and bleeding Redeemer. The duty indeed is yours, but the ability is his: as much as in you lies, cause every lust of your heart to make room for your dear Jesus.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Welcom Christ into your heart with joy. Say to him as <hi>Laban</hi> did to <hi>Abraham's</hi> Servant, <hi>Come in thou blessed of the Lord, [thou art welcome] wherefore standeth thou without?</hi> Gen.24.31. Christ will come to you with a blessing in his hand to bestow on you, as he did to <hi>Jacob.</hi> Gen. 32.26, <hi>&amp;c. David</hi> literal saith to his Son (that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited him to his house) <hi>Why should we be chargeable to thee, my Son?</hi> 2 Sam. 13. 25. But this <hi>David</hi> spiritual will not be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable: wheresoever he comes, where he comes to sup with any soul, he brings his supper with him, <hi>Rev.</hi>3.20. and eats but of his own honey-comb, and of his own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, <hi>Cant.</hi>5.1. This blessed Guest brings his blessing with him, as the Ark did to the house of <hi>Obed Edom.</hi>

to dwell in your heart by faith, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. 17. be careful to keep his habitation quiet and comfortable; to this end you must adjure your corruptions <hi>by the roes and by the hinds of the field, that they stir not up nor awake your beloved until he please,</hi> Cant.2.7. 'Tis pity such a blessed Guest should meet with any disturbance; lay Gods charge upon your lusts, saying to them as <hi>Lot</hi> did to the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> Gen.19.8. <hi>Only unto this Angel of the Lord, and this Lord of Angels, do nothing [of disturbance] for therefore came he under the shadow of my roof:</hi> and as the good old man to the men of <hi>Gibeah,</hi> Judg,19.23. <hi>Nay, I pray you do not so wickedly, seeing this man</hi> (Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus) <hi>is come into my house, do not this folly to disturb him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Be oft admiring that blessed state of Grace which God hath brought you into, out of the cursed state of sin, and say with <hi>Peter</hi> at Christs transfiguration, <hi>Master, 'tis good being here; let us build Tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias;</hi> not one for himself, for he was so pleased with his present condition, that he could be content to lie out of doors, so he

            </p>
            <p n="5">5: Be oft searching your heart in the sense, I: Of the state of sin, out of which (<hi>as</hi> Israel <hi>out of the house of bondage, and out of the Iron furnace,</hi> Deut:4:20:) your God, your near kinsman, the Lord Jesus hath deliver'd you. 2: Of the remainders of sin, from which you are not cleansed to this day, you cannot chide it out of doors as <hi>Sarah</hi> did <hi>Hagar;</hi> you cannot shake it from off your heart as <hi>Paul</hi> did the Viper from off his hand; 'tis as <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Beasts, <hi>whose dominion was taken away, but their lives were prolonged for a time and a season,</hi> Dan:7:12: this will ballast your new-found joy.</p>

of the rest. The frailties of those eminent Saints are registred in Holy Writ, just as dangerous Rocks are marked out at Sea, not to run upon them, but to shun them: they are penned down as examples of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but not of imitation. You must know, that they which followed the dark side of the Cloud (in the Red-sea) were <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and were drowned; but they that followed the bright side of it, were <hi>Israelites,</hi> and passed safe, not only over the Red-sea, but into <hi>Canaan.</hi>

            <p n="4">4. Have not the Faith of Christ with respect of persons, but be careful to love Grace in rags, as well as in robes: Grace may, indeed, commend Gold, but Gold can never commend Grace; the lesser must be the blest of the greater: Tis true, that Gold may beautifie the Temple, but 'tis still the Temple that sanctifies the Gold. Persons, though never so rich, or never so richly array'd, are at the best but silken dust, and they may be no better than golden damnation.</p>
            <p>The second part of your Conversation is that which respects your self, &amp;c.</p>

            <p n="2">2: Be sure you give not place to little sins, for they will wear away the tenderness of your Conscience, and like little thieves, (creeping in at the window) they will open the door for great ones; little wedges do make way for the greater, and so your soul may be cloven asunder thereby: Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sin, be it small or great, should be a stranger to you, and not an home-dweller in you. Thus <hi>David'</hi>s Sin was but a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller, that came only to visit him, but not to take up any continuing lodgings within him.

            <p n="3">3. Live not at random, but square your life by the rule of Righteousness, <hi>to wit,</hi> the Word of God, in thought, Word and Deed; and account every transgression of that rule to be your sin; at night call your faithless heart to a faithful account how oft and how much you have come short of that rule the day past; a sensible frame of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit will easily find out, that Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments are exceeding broad, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 96. but your obedience is exceeding nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; and that your sins are more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber than the hairs upon your head, <hi>Psal.</hi> 40.12. so innumerable, that you cannot rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon them, (<hi>who can tell the errors of his life?</hi> Psal.19.12) and if you cannot reckon them sure I am, you can never be able to reckon for them, that must be the work of your blessed Surety, our dear Lord Jesus.</p>

in your heart, <hi>Jer.</hi>4.14. as water that is sprung into a Ship, is presently pumpt out again in leaky Vessels, for fear of sink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; So when any soul-sinking sin springs in upon you (which certainly will come faster in than water into a vessel at Sea) then be sure you ply the Pump of Prayer and Repentance, and never give over pump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, till your Vessel be cleansed, and till you have some sense that your sin is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned; you will not go to bed with a bone out of joynt, but it must be set right with expedition; 'tis pity that the soul (disjoynted with sin) should be so long neglected.</p>
            <p n="5">5. 'Tis a blessed frame of spirit to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish in you both the sense of your own sin, and the fear of Gods wrath for your sin: the heavier that your sins are to you, the lighter will your afflictions be on you; 'tis wind and rain coming both together, that makes the storm in our souls; when your sin is your burden, 'tis then repented of, and so pardoned; this will make your affliction a far lighter burden.</p>

'Tis a foul fault to grieve an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father; but 'tis far greater to grieve this holy spirit: If you grieve the Holy Ghost, how can you expect that he should comfort you? when you are grieved, you cannot do your work as you are wont, and neither can the holy Spirit do his work in and for you: a Guest that is grieved, may leave the house that grieves him; so this delicate thing (the Spirit of God) may leave your house desolate, when grieved with your sins, <hi>Mat.</hi>23:38. and then wo to you if God and his good spirit depart from you, <hi>Hos.</hi>9.12.</p>

You must stir up this fire (as the Apostle counselleth, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>1.6. and not despise Prophecying; for the Priests lips blows it up into a flame, it may be quenched either by withdrawing of fuel <hi>to wit,</hi> neglect of Ordinances; or by cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on water, <hi>to wit,</hi> by falling into foul courses: you must beware of both.</p>

The ancient Martyrs would not accept of deliverance upon ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble and sinful terms, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 35. They would not throw so much as one grain of frankincense to the Idol, though it would have saved their own lives; hence <hi>Daniel</hi> chose rather to be cast to the Lions, than to violate his Conscience, and so to have a Lion roaring in his bosom; he knew that in an angry Conscience he might feel the unbearable stroaks of an angry God; and a man had better anger all the Witches in the world; yea, and all the Devils in hell, than anger God.</p>

Thus the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Christians cried [<hi>Ad leones potius quam ad Lenones</hi>] Throw us to your Lions, rather than to your Harlotry; though this would save our lives, yet would it destroy our souls.

You may be Righteous over much in denying your self such a free use of the Creature (yea, and condemning it too) which you are allowed to have by the purchase and promise of Christ. Thus <hi>Isaac</hi> (who was the most loving Husband in holy Writ, for 'tis said of him, and of none else, that he loved his Wife, <hi>Gen.</hi>24:67:) <hi>Sported with</hi> Rebeccah <hi>his Wife,</hi> Gen. 26. 8: And the <hi>Jew</hi> was commanded to cheer up the heart of his Wife the first year, <hi>Deut:</hi> 24: 5, And <hi>Solomon</hi> bids the Husband <hi>be alwayes ravished with her beauty,</hi> Prov:5:18, 19: Thus <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Wife was call'd <hi>the desire of his eyes,</hi> Ezek: 24: 16: Assuredly men ought to take singular Complacency in their Wives company, and yet without all uxoriousness: None questions Parents dandling their Children upon their knees, as old <hi>Joseph</hi> did his Grand-children, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50: 23: <hi>Isa:</hi> 66 12.</p>

<pb n="47" facs="unknown:000358_0047_0FA55507EAF786E8"/>
Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for managing your heart aright in your Rest or Recreations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Direct.</hi> You must take heed of wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much precious time therein: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we do not so much want time, as wast time; a vain expence of that time, (which either your general calling re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires in holy duties, or your particular calling calls upon you for in necessary em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments) is not only unlawful, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable? you are commanded to redeem time, <hi>Eph.</hi>5.16. but never to pass time: the loss of time is such a precious thing that God commands satisfaction for it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.19. It will be but a poor reckoning at your Lords returning, in your accompt for expence of your talent of time; <hi>Item,</hi> spent so many dayes or hours in Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Oh what would the damned in Hell give for but one of those hours which we have wilfully wasted! Time is like the Urchion or Hedg-hog that must not be handled by the head, but by the heels, in its going from you; take time while time serves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Dir.</hi> The second Direction is, be sure you be moderate in your Recreation; 'tis
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:000358_0048_0FA5550A4168AC08"/>
compared to honey, it must be taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the tip of the finger only, and not whole handfuls of it, for fear of surfeiting: <hi>Omne nimium vertitur in vitium;</hi> alas mans weak heart is soon overcharged, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.34. and soon grows frothy, foolish, if not sensual and sinful in it; you must know, that the holy end of Recreation is to fit you the more for the duties of your general and particular calling (in case of weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of body, or tiredness of mind) but if it indispose you to either or both, your heart doth deceive you; such as spend their lives in sports, and their livelyhood too, will prove but bad accomptants, when they bring in the broken Accounts of their Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardship to their Lord and Master at the last day.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Direct.</hi> The third Direction is, chuse your Recreations that are of best report, and of least offence, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.8. 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 8: 13. You may not make any of Gods Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or punishments for sin (either in man or beast) the matter or object of your sport and recreation, as the folly of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural fool, the antipathy of beasts (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they tear and destroy one another)
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:000358_0049_0FA5550B4715B498"/>
which are fruits of the Fall, and of mans Rebellion against God; it should be rather matter of mourning than of rejoycing. Neither may you chuse (for your sport) whatsoever moves troublesome passions, as fear, anger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor those wherein is a lot (which is a religious act and an ordinance of God) which ought not to be sported with:</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Dir.</hi> The fourth Direction is; having pitch'd upon such Recreations as are harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and sinless, yet may you not stain them with bad Companions, such as you cannot consort with, but you must either counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance sin, or contract sin; such as you must contract either guilt or grief, as before. All Tares must be bundled together; such as spend their time together in sports on earth, may howl in hell together to all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Dir.</hi> The fifth Direction: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all, yet must you account it safer not to trust your heart with any Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all, any further than is plainly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary: get (therefore) up your heart to live without them, and take up your whole delight in God, <hi>Psal:</hi> 37:4. Then if
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:000358_0050_0FA5550B83669718"/>
at any time you be constrained to use them you will be as if you used them not, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29. and <hi>as not having, yet still having,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 6.10. that is, your heart will not be enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to any thing but to God, and your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections will keep uppermost for Jesus Christ: the truth is, were but our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons more mortified, and spiritual duties more natural to us, we might better live without those, than the Philosophers (as they said) could dine and sup without mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick; therefore as <hi>Joshuah</hi> haughed the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites</hi> Chariots-horses, <hi>Josh.</hi>11: 6—9: and <hi>David Zobah's,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi>8.4. so intreat thy <hi>Joshuah,</hi> thy Jesus the Son of <hi>David,</hi> to hough thy carnal affections, that as <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> Chariot-horses, they set not all on fire; then delight in God, and thou'lt need less the delights of the world.</p>

               <p n="1">1. The 3<hi>d.</hi> Natural Action is feeding your belly, which is daily work, for our tottering tabernacles of clay stand in need to be supported with the staff of daily bread, and therefore is our life call'd <hi>the life of our hands,</hi> Isa. 57.10: as our hands are daily
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:000358_0051_0FA5550C413A9EF8"/>
(yea hourly) administring something ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther back or belly, to support our life. Those common actions (of feeding and clothing us) are steps in our Christian conversation, and therefore ought not to be despised, but are rather to be regulated and reformed to their supream scope. <hi>to wit,</hi> Gods Glory.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Dir.</hi> Hence your first Direction is, Be sure you eat and drink with an aim at the Glory of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>10.31. You must eat for God, and drink for God; <hi>Quicquid agas propter Deum agas,</hi> do all in reference to God; receive not any of Gods blessings with a carnal frame of heart; but look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all your temporal mercies (set before you on the Table) with a spiritual eye, and improve them with a spiritual heart. Good old <hi>Isidore</hi> wept at his Table, crying out, <hi>I am ashamed that I should feed on corruptible beasts, whereas I was created to be a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Angels, and to feed upon heavenly food with them.</hi> A worthy Minister of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was said to eat, drink and sleep eternal life, for in those earthly and natural actions he still kept an heavenly and spiritual heart. The main weight of his meditations was laid upon God (the giver of them) and his glory.
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:000358_0052_0FA5550D147332F0"/>
Oh could you but eat to his glory, &amp; drink to his glory, you would not so easily fin in them.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Dir. T</hi>he second Direction: Feed your self with a God-blessing heart, which is the true spiritual heave-offering, <hi>Numb.</hi>15.19. When your heart is heaved or lifted up to God, and in every thing gives thanks saying, Oh what charges do you put God to, in consuming his Corn and his Cattle, <hi>Hos.</hi>2.8,9.

Have high thoughts of God, and low of your self; the same <hi>Jacob</hi> that had pleaded his merit with <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban,</hi> Gen:31:38—41. yet here sets a low rate on himself to God.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Dir.</hi> The third Direction: whatever sweetness you find in any creature (you
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:000358_0053_0FA5550DB75158B0"/>
feed upon) let it lead you to the spring-head of that sweetness; do you say, Is there so much favour in those derivative gifts? there must needs be much more in the original giver: Labour to swim up those streams till you reach the spring; cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>If mercy be so good, Oh what is the God of mercy? Oh that I may come at him, as well as at his mercies!</hi> and learn to love God for himself, as well as for his benefits; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting your self in Gods goodness as well as in that of the creatures, <hi>Neh:</hi>9.25.</p>
               <p n="4">4<hi>Dir.</hi> The fourth Direction: You may not feed your self without fear, as those in <hi>Jud.</hi>12, 1. But first, sanctifie it by Prayer, 1 <hi>Tim:</hi>4:4,5. Look on that bread which is not got in an honest Vocation, and sanctified by an holy Invocation, to be no wholsome bread, but such as may prove diseases to your body, and sin to your soul: If wicked men say, we will neither eat nor drink till we have killed <hi>Paul,</hi> Act.23.12. then godly men must say, we will neither eat nor drink till we have call'd on God, as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.31. <hi>Mark</hi> 6:41. <hi>Act.</hi>27. 35.

not only with his leave, but also with his love; not only from his hand, but also from his heart; not only out of the Court of Christs general providence, but also out of the Court of special favour. 2. Feed soberly: Sobriety will reclaim you from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either unseasonable in time, or unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable either in matter or measure, either in quantity or quality: 1. Not unseason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as to time, <hi>Eccl.</hi>10,16. not as luxurious persons, that serve their bellies in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (that golden hour for Prayer) before they serve their God; nor as those in <hi>Amos</hi> 6.4.6. that Feasted riotously, without lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to heart the afflictions of <hi>Joseph;</hi> while <hi>Joseph</hi> was in the Pit; alas, his Brethren pitied him not, <hi>Gen:</hi> 32:23: 2. Neither must it be unreasonable either for matter or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; 1. Not for matter or quality, as the rich Glutton, <hi>that fared deliciously every day,</hi> Luk:16:19: as Purple and Silk was his daily clothing, so costly delicacies was his daily Food; but (alas) it was all his Heaven he had, as <hi>Abraham</hi> told him when he was in Hell. You must set a knife to your throat, that is, to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscible appetite (which stands more in
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:000358_0055_0FA5550F30928E18"/>
need of a bridle than a spur) as to those things, <hi>Prov:</hi>23:2,3,20: and say with <hi>David Let me not eat of their dainties,</hi> Psal: 141:4: and with <hi>Daniel,</hi> refrain <hi>from them for fear of a snare,</hi> Dan:1:8: Nor 2. Must it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable for measure or quantity: fulness of bread was <hi>Sodoms</hi> sin, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.49: her <hi>Food was fuel for her lasciviousness;</hi> you may not make provision for the flesh <hi>to fulfil the lusts thereof,</hi> Rom:13: <hi>ult.</hi> then is your fulness and excess when it overchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges you, <hi>Luk:</hi>21:34: and disenables you for the duties of either your general or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular calling. 3: When you have eaten and are full, <hi>then bless the Lord your God, Deut:</hi>8:10. when you are as <hi>Napthali,</hi> sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with favour, and filled with the blessings of the Lord, <hi>Deut:</hi>33:23: then give God solemn thanks for all, and be not like prophane <hi>Esau,</hi> that sat down to eat and drink, and rose up and went his way; never reflecting upon himself, nor blessing God for his mercies; nor like the hog under the Apple-tree, that gluts himself with the Fruit that falls, but never looks up to the Tree from whence they fall.
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:000358_0056_0FA55510921D3118"/>

               <p>The fourth natural action is clothing your body, wherein the pride of your heart may deceive you, <hi>Obad.</hi> 3. Therefore take these Directions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first Direction: Ponder the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal of your clothing; it was not in the state of innocency, for then was there nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parching heat, nor pinching cold; and nakedness was then no shame but a glorious comeliness; shame is the daughter of sin, which brought in the first clothing as well as distemperature of air (in heat and cold) the fruits of the fall: Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that nakedness of the soul brought in the first clothing for the body; so that 'tis but the badge of man's shame, and the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of his rebellion against his Maker; it carries along with it a secret confession of his own guilt. You may not then be proud of your Apparel, for that is to be
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:000358_0057_0FA555111C2093A8"/>
proud of your own shame; no man is proud of a plaister on his sore, for that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrates there is a wound; no Thief is proud of his Fetters, for they declare he he hath offended the law, and that heinous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; neither must you be of your garments, which are the cover of your shame, and the sign of your sin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second Direction: Take notice that all your clothing are but borrowed things; how do you borrow the skin, hair &amp; wool of bruit beasts, to cover your naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness withal, and what are your silks, but the spittle and excrements of a poor worm? All (as it were) the very cast-apparel of unreasonable creatures: Man lives on bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing, and that from things that are worse than himself in respect of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Therefore you may not be proud of these things that you borrow; no creature so begarly, so needy as man is, in point of clothing; for every creature brings its clothing into the world with it, but you were born a naked creature, and must bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row all to cover you, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.4,6: And will you be proud (as the Crow in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) of your borrowed Feathers? you may
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:000358_0058_0FA555137A39A3C0"/>
well know, that your God doth not cover you for any such end.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third Direction: Instead of proud reflections on your self, use holy So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liloquies with your self; saying; 1 I have a naked Soul to cover (as well as a naked body) and therefore must look out for the wedding garment, <hi>to wit,</hi> the righteousness of Christ (both imparted and imputed) I must put on the Lord Jesus Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13,14. that I may not be found naked, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.15. but that I may be comely to God as well as to man. 2. The putting off your clothing at night, should mind you of putting off the old man, <hi>&amp;c. Eph.</hi>4.22. and of putting off your Tabernacle of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 2 <hi>Pet:</hi> 1:14. 2 <hi>Cor:</hi>5:2,3,4. and then must you go down to the bed of the grave, there to sleep till the morning of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection. 3. When you put on your clothing again in the morning, it should mind you, that you must be raised out of the bed of the grave, and then <hi>corruption shall put on incorruption, and mortality shall be swallowed up of life,</hi> 1 Cor.15.53. 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 5.4. if you have put on the new man, the image of God in Christ.</p>

               <p>The second sort of Actions are Civil, as your Commerce and Trading with others.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Direction the first: That you may be kept from sinning herein, get your heart fraught with the fear of God, as <hi>Joseph,</hi> Gen.42.18. &amp; <hi>Neh.</hi>5.9,15. those good men had a curb upon them to restrain them from wronging others; and where this curb is not, men will not stick at any sin, <hi>as Gen.</hi>20.11.</p>

which are either private or publick; The first of which will discover your state best to you; for every man is, what he is in private; and a truly pious soul will be found is Religious actions as well in the shade, as in the sun; he will make conscience of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as well when no body sees him (for he knows he's always under the all-seeing eye) as when any or many see him; you must go beyond the hypocrite in the practice of secret duty. As, 1: In hearty bewailings of your own imperfections; 2: In hearty bleeding acknowledgments of your unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses to Christ, and to his gracious Spirit; 3: In partings and inquietations of Soul after Union and Communion with God; 4: In hungrings and longings after spiritual refreshment, and transforming of soul in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>T</hi>he unsound heart is a stranger to those addresses to God (or at most, but slight in them, if found in that work at all) he is careless in self-examination, cursory in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, faint in heart-watchings, and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in mortification; but nothing at all in loving and walking with God, and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him.

these; and be but a good Christian in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate duties, and you cannot be a bad one in publick.</p>
               <p n="1">1 More particularly concerning Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Actions: And,</p>
               <p n="1">1: Of Meditation, that most necessary and much neglected duty; this must be (1) your spiritual Ladder (as <hi>Jacob</hi> had his) whereon you ascend in divine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations of the excellency of your bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and bleeding Saviour, till your heart be ravished therewithal.</p>

By night, how is it bespangled with glittering and glorious Stars, then think with your self that this splendid firmament (which I behold) is but the outside of the palace of God, and the under-seiling only thereof; and if that have so much lustre and beauty, how much more hath the inside, where the divine transcendent Majesty of the Trinity (with innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble both of glorious Angels, and of glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Saints) shineth forth!</p>

               <p n="6">6. When you view the changeableness of the face of Heaven, and its outward appearance unto you; this may teach you in the third place, that as the Heaven is sometimes bright, and sometimes clouded, not all night, nor all day; the Sun some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times over-cast with a black cloud, and sometimes breaking out in its splendor and glory; and as the Moon hath her changes and her borrowed light, ruling the night, as the Sun the day, so you may not expect any fixed constancy in any condition upon earth, while there is such changeableness in the face of heaven.</p>

of the World, then did the Lord spread out that heaven like a curtain, and it hath continued spread for almost six thousand years, yet not one hole can be discerned in that curtain to this day: Oh how may this teach you the unchangeableness of God who was the Creator and is the upholder of Heaven, and what a safe place heaven is, to lay up your treasure in, so far cut of the reach of all rust and robbery.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Thus far of occasional Meditation upon the book of nature; there is also Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation appointed upon the book of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which you must be acquainted with, as far exceeding the other; for the book of nature, though never so diligently read over, yet will it not bring you to the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving knowledg of God in Christ, nor throughly furnish you for every good work but the book of Scripture is a larger field, furnished with all sorts of spiritual and fragrant flowers, whereupon you may free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feed your best thoughts without ever nauseating. If you can but unclasp the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of your own heart (when you unclasp your Bible) a praying heart can never want a profitable subject; Oh let it not please you that carnal hearts can think of things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, not only an hour, a day, a week, a moneth, but even a whole year without weariness, and that to think on Gods name <hi>Mal.</hi>3.17. should weary you so soon. 2. This se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond sort of meditation is a set &amp; solemn acting
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:000358_0071_0FA555237423D6E0"/>
of the soul upon some chosen subject, till you can extract some sweet and soul-ravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing thoughts out of your own heart there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; your subject or matter of meditation must be some scriptural truths, such as are summarily comprehended in <hi>Phil.</hi>4.8.(that little Bible) <hi>Whatsoever things are true, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any vertue, if there be any praise, think on these things.</hi> In that one <hi>Verse</hi> is contained the whole duty of Man, the good and the All of man, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12.13. <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.8.</p>
               <p>The second Religious Action is Prayer, which well follows Meditation; for as: 1. Meditation is a blessed beginning to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, so prayer is a blessed conclusion of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, &amp; therefore is the double reading of <hi>Gen.</hi> 24: 63: <hi>Isaac</hi> went out to meditate, or he went out to pray. So then when your heart is weell warmed with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical duty of Meditation, then fall upon the Evangelical duty of Prayer, then tender and render your homage to the God of all
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:000358_0072_0FA55526767D18C0"/>
your mercies, crying with <hi>David, Oh the God of my mercies,</hi> Psal.59.10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You must know, that Prayer is the pouring out of the heart to God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 62.8. 'Tis not the pouring out of your speech but of your spirit unto the Lord. God looks not so much at what you do, as with what spirit you do for him; you must serve God with your spirit in the Gospel of his Son, <hi>Rom</hi> 1.9. not resting in a bare gift of Prayer, without the grace of Prayer, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. you may not fetch materials or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities for this work from your self, but you must pray in the Holy Ghost, <hi>Jude.</hi> v.20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26: The lifting up of your own tools upon Gods Altar, will not polish, but pollute it, <hi>Exod:</hi> 20: <hi>ult.</hi> That earnestness in prayer which flows meerly from a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural spirit, is but the cry of the creature and not the groans of that holy spirit which helps our infirmities; but expressions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out impressions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You must pray that God may rebuke Satan that resists you in prayer; watch the adversary that watches you, and watch your own heart likewise, which will not only hang off from this work, but will also

God requires the strength of your affections in his service; every offering must be made by fire, if of a sweet savour to the Lord, <hi>Lev.</hi> 1.9.13,17. yea your self, as well as your sacrifice, must be falted with fire, <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 49. <hi>David</hi> prayed and cried with his whole heart, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119,58,145. <hi>Samson</hi> bows himself with all his might at the Pillars of <hi>Dagons</hi> Temple, <hi>Judg.</hi>16.30. and have not you the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds of sin in you to be pull'd down by Prayer.

               <p n="5">5. Be not regardless about the returns of your prayers, nor careless of the events and issue of them; be not like those Archers that shoot not at a mark, but at rovers, at random, never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving where their arrows fall. Spiritual pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are the arrows of Gods deliverance, 2 <hi>King</hi> 13. 16,17. Prayer is like the Bow of <hi>Jonathan,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi>1.22. It never returns empty. If you dare be careless in asking, how can you wonder that God is careless in answering?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Be clothed with Humility while you are in prayer to God: He that resists the proud, gives grace to the humble. In order hereto, get the Majesty of the great God (with whom you have to do therein) wrought kindly upon your heart, till you know (aright) your distance, not only your natural distance 'twixt God and you, as you are a creature; but especially your mortal distance 'twixt God and you as you are a sinner</p>

<pb n="76" facs="unknown:000358_0075_0FA55528B2B96D88"/>
all religious actions are summarily compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended. You must look upon the Sabbath as the Epitome and Compendium of a Religion, having all the priviledges that commend the most substantial precepts in Scripture to us, as 1. Its frequent mentioning (almost) in every book of the Bible. 2. God's interest (after a special manner) in it; 'tis frequently call'd [<hi>His</hi>] Sabbath. And 3<hi>ly.</hi> 'Tis called a special gift and favour of God to his People, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.29. <hi>Ezek.</hi>20.12. <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.14. 'Tis a great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour for God that it is given to you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Therefore you must remember to keep it holy, <hi>Exod.</hi>20.8. (it may be read thus) <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to keep holy a day of rest unto me: Six dayes shalt thou labour, but a seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.</hi> The very Preface [<hi>Remember</hi>] which none of the other Commands have, instructs you, how weighty and necessary this duty is, which you are prone to forget.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That you may keep it holy, you must (in the first place) have an high and holy estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it; the phrase is, <hi>He that esteemeth a day, and he that regardeth a day,</hi> Rom.14. 5,6. You must have an high regard for it, and esteem it honourable, <hi>Isa.</hi> 58.13. <hi>As the day which the Lord hath made,</hi> Psal.118.12. (This Christ ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes to the day of his Resurrection, <hi>Mat.</hi>21.24) How can it but be an honourable day to you which the Lord your God hath sanctified for you? 2<hi>ly.</hi> As you must have an holy estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:000358_0076_0FA5552970B26670"/>
of it, so you must make an holy preparation for it; you must prepare <hi>to meet your God, Amos</hi> 4. 12. As the Bride prepares her self to meet her Bridegroom; how did <hi>Ruth</hi> wash her self, and anoint her, and put on her best raiment, that she might become amiable, and accepted to <hi>Boas?</hi> Ruth 3. 3. How much more should you be purified for the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords! The <hi>Jews</hi> had a preparation for the passeover, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.42. you must make preparation for the Sabbath, the want of which may hinder your soul of a Sabbath-blessing, as (no doubt) it has done. 3<hi>ly.</hi> You must keep it holy by an holy observation of it, in using all holy means, and doing all holy duties (both private and publick) all the whole day.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Be sure it be a desirable day to you, as well as holy and honourable; it should be the desire of dayes. You should cry (with that good man) to it in the morning of the Sabbath. Come my bride of dayes, thou art welcome; and with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> say, <hi>Oh when shall I come and appear before my God,</hi> Psal. 42.2, Where are your pantings and palpitations of heart after an enjoyment of Gods Sabbath? You have six dayes to provide for the worser part, and but one for the better: how careful are you all the six dayes for the beast in you? Oh, be not careless upon that one day for the Angel in you.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Let not your hold go of any one precious Sabbath, without some sweet refreshment to your
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:000358_0077_0FA5552EB790E250"/>
soul, as well as rest to your body; 'tis said, <hi>Exod</hi> 31.17. <hi>The Lord rested and was refreshed;</hi> is it so with you? do you find any rest for your wand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thoughts, and any refreshing for your fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble spirit? Account it a very great loss to lose one Sabbath day without some advantage and growth: Oh what a God-blessing heart should you have, that God should give you such a day, and call upon you also (and that often) to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve that day: and that not for any advantage to himself (for <hi>your goodness extends not to God,</hi> Psal.16. 3. though his doth to you) but all for your own good. This obliges you to be careful and conscientious in the improvement of the day, and honouring the Son with his day under the Gospel, as they honoured the Father with his day under the Law, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.23.</p>
               <p n="6">6. You shall assuredly be blessed, if you keep the Sabbath which God blessed, <hi>Isa.</hi> 56.2. 1. With Holiness here; the power of godliness lives and dies with the keeping of the Sabbath. 2. You shall be blessed with Happiness hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; such as keep holy this Temporal Sabbath, shall be made happy in the Eternal Sabbath; but such as prophane it, shall never enter into God's rest, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. <hi>ult. &amp;</hi> 4. 9,10.</p>
