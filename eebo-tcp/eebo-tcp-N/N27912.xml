            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHY, my brethren, are we aſſembled together? Why do I ſee your countenances ſad, and your garb the garb of mourning? Why are our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-citizens throughout the United States, aſſembled in their various towns, this day? Yea, why are the free born ſons of America, from New-Hampſhire to Georgia, this day in mourning? Ah! why? Is our country invaded by a hoſtile foe, threatening imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate deſtruction? No. Does famine prevail, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the people to ſupplicate the favour of God? No. Does the peſtilence walk through our ſtreets and cauſe groan to anſwer groan, and ſpread deſolation through all our towns? No. The reaſon is this, <hi>A great man has fallen</hi> in America. Your beloved WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON is no more. Yes: WASHINGTON, the great, the wiſe, the humane, the father of his country and the benefactor of man, has fallen into the icy arms of death. This, you are ſenſible, is the cauſe which has aſſembled us together: This is the reaſon why all United America this day mourns.</p>

               <hi>KNOW YE NOT THERE IS A GREAT MAN FALLEN IN ISRAEL!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WASHINGTON was truly <hi>great.</hi> When difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties aroſe between America and her mother country, our ſituation ſeemed pitiable. Our country was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded by a nation accuſtomed to war, a nation fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with able generals and a well diſciplined army, a nation powerful in arms. But we were in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant ſtate, unprepared and comparatively weak. Our reſources were ſmall and our citizens were unlearned in the art of war. Conſidering, however, that our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and property were at ſtake, the free born ſons of America awoke: They left the plow for the ſword: They left their houſes, their families, their wives and cildren in the hands of providence, and haſtened away to face the enemy.</p>
            <p>THOUGH, perhaps, we wanted not for lovers of our country and men of courage; yet we wanted experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced commanders, and diſcipline in our troops. Why were we not overcome? The Lord was on our ſide. Soon we were provided with able generals and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplined ſoldiers. Under the good providence of God, our ſtrength increaſed, and our little band became of ſome conſequence.</p>
            <p>EARLY in the war the name of WASHINGTON reſounded. The greatneſs of his mind began to ſhine. His wiſdom, prudence and valour became conſpicuous. Soon he was raiſed to the ſupreme command of our armies. He was the very man we wanted: the very man that providence deſigned for ſignal ſervice to his country. He accepted the poſt aſſigned him, and was
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037182_0006_100CE3B5CAF023F0"/>
unwearied in his attention to his army. Far from oſtentatiou<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> or haughtineſs, he was plain and conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending in his deportment. They who were under his command were uſed with that lenity and humanity as convinced them that their General was their friend. How beloved was he by his ſoldiers! Were he in danger a thouſand ſwords would leap from their ſcab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards to defend their beloved chief.</p>
            <p>HIS prudence directed him when to avoid the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; he had wiſdom to contrive his operations in the field, in the beſt manner; and his courage never fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in executing his plans, when the good of his country called. He was neither <hi>rash</hi> nor <hi>cowardly.</hi> Always calm, ſteady and reſolute, he carried his points, with unexpected ſucceſs. His army, knowing his wiſdom, prudence and courage, were willing to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him wherever he led.</p>
            <p>SUCH was the power of the enemy, and ſuch were the diſadvantages under which we laboured, that our army had to encounter many diſcouragements, and to paſs through many adverſe ſcenes. But the greatneſs of WASHINGTON's mind was able to overcome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements. If the army began to deſpond, the preſence of WASHINGTON inſpired every ſoul with animation. If obſtacles preſented, and inſtilled faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs into their minds, their WASHINGTON was at their head, and by his example and direction taught them to ſurmount the obſtacles. In adverſe ſcenes he was like the rock in the ocean, unmoved by daſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing waves. His mind was too great to deſpair. He knew how to bear adverſity. Neither did proſperity intoxicate his mind ſo as to tempt him to lay aſide
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037182_0007_100CE3B7E860C6D8"/>
his wonted circumſpection. In proſperity and adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity he was the ſame, calm, firm, reſolute and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant. He continued to act the part of wiſdom and courage till at length, with the aid of his brave ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and fellow-citizens, together with the aſſiſtance of a foreign ally, he gained the final victory: a vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, humbling indeed to the enemy: a victory which brought freedom and independence to our country. Hail! auſpicious day! a day when liberty was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured to brave Americans.</p>
            <p>O America, long mayeſt thou retain that indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for which thy ſons have bravely fought. And long mayeſt thou remember him who headed thine armies to the field of battle, and led them forth to victory: Yes; long mayeſt thou remember the name of WASHINGTON.</p>
            <p>PEACE being happily ſettled, WASHINGTON, unambitious, did not attempt to lord it over his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; but modeſtly retired to live the life of a private citizen.</p>
            <p>HIS country, however, did not long ſuffer him to taſte the ſweets of retired life.—When they who were choſen to frame a new and energetic conſtitution for their country, were aſſembled. WASHINGTON was among them, and was the man to preſide over their deliberations. After an energetic tho' liberal conſtitution was framed and adopted, a man was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to hold the executive power. Americans, tho' by this time conſiderably numerous, and ſcattered over a vaſt tract of country; yet <hi>all</hi> with one voice exclaim WASHINGTON, <hi>none</hi> but WASHINGTON! The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037182_0008_100CE3BB2E980638"/>
Hero again obeyed his country's call and was inveſted with the office of preſident of United America. This office he executed with wiſdom and firmneſs, and to the general acceptance of his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. He was not influened by fear or flattery, to looſe ſight of his duty to his country. When the term for which he was choſen expired, his country <hi>repeated</hi> the call, and he <hi>again</hi> obeyed his country's voice.—At length he reſolved again to retire to the life of a private citizen. Not long, however, had he thus lived till difficulties aroſe, and it was thought neceſſary to raiſe new troops, and put the country in poſture of defence. But who ſhould be the man to take the charge of our troops? Who, but WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON? The <hi>brave Veteran</hi> again was called, and he <hi>even again</hi> accepted. He was conſequently inveſted with the office of Lieut. General of the armies of United America: and this was the laſt office he ſuſtained in the ſervice of his country.</p>
            <p>FROM the manner in which he fulfilled the duties of his ſeveral ſtations, WASHINGTON's <hi>greatness</hi> appeared.—</p>
            <p>HE was <hi>great</hi> in <hi>abilities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No doubt, the God of nature endowed him with <hi>great</hi> native ſtrength and penetration of mind. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the multiplicity of buſineſs which devolved upon his hands, and the active ſervice of his country, in which he was continually kept, his <hi>acquired</hi> abilities were alſo great, greater, perhaps, than would have been the acquirements of almoſt any other man under like embarraſſments. In his writings his acquired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037182_0009_100CE3BCC6F357B8"/>
ſhine with luſtre. His compoſitions have been generally acknowledged to contain ideas which are noble and juſt. His ſtile was elegant, unaffected, conciſe and comprehenſive. He eaſily conveyed his ideas in language which was directly to the point, without oſtentation and circumlocution. When we view him in the field or the cabinet, in war or in peace, or in whatever ſtation he held, we muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that he was a man <hi>great</hi> in abilities.</p>
            <p>WASHINGTON was <hi>great</hi> in <hi>integrity.</hi> This was manifeſt through the whole of his life. Never have we heard of a treacherous act which he hath perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his country. Great indeed and almoſt unlimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was the confidence which was placed in him; and he did not abuſe the confidence. When we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his great foreſight and his unbounded influence in the army, together with the confidence placed in him by the government, we may well ſuppoſe that if he had undertaken to betray his country, incalculable would have been our misfortunes. If WASHINGTON had been a traitor, where had been our liberty, our lives and property? But far be it from us to ſuppoſe that ever a treacherous idea entered his mind. When others proved traitors, <hi>he</hi> was the ſtedfaſt pillar not to be ſhaken. His integrity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was ſo undiſputed that it has become proverbial not only in America, but Europe and the nations of the world.</p>
            <p>WASHINGTON was a <hi>great</hi> lover of his country. Who will diſpute this, when his whole life declared it? From his youth to his death was he not in the ſervice of his country? Was he not faithful in this ſervice? Was he not exceedingly active, firm and reſolute in
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037182_0010_100CE3BE6C8AC560"/>
his country's cauſe? Has he not ever ſacrificed his private eaſe to the public welfare? Did he ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe when his country called? No dangers, no riſk of reputation, no domeſtic enjoyments, could keep him from boldly ſtepping forth to ſerve the publick. We have no reaſon to doubt but that the love of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try reigned in his heart, and the public good fired his ſoul to action.</p>
            <p>WASHINGTON manifeſted a ſenſe of the divine exiſtence and of God's Government over nations and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals—a ſenſe of human dependence and men's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations to acknowledge God's hand in all their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns—a ſenſe of the importance of the Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, in order for nations to be proſpered and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals to be happy.</p>
            <p>WASHINGTON was a man of morality. We ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of him practiſing that profaneneſs too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the army. We never heard of him from the gaming table. We never heard of him engorging the intoxicating draught. No. He was a man of temperance—a man of exemplary deportment—a man of morality. This was his general character. I know not that his morality was ever queſtioned.</p>
            <p>HE was a man of dignity. Though he was not haughty and oſtentation; yet he maintained his dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. He was modeſt and condeſcending, but far from all meanneſs. I know not that an unmanly act ever ſtained his character.</p>
            <p>HE was a man of perſeverance. Whatever he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook, he was accuſtomed to accompliſh. Cold,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037182_0011_100CE3C009117110"/>
hunger, thirſt, fatigue, difficulties, or dangers, did not eaſily break him off from purſuing his plans to effect.</p>
            <p>HE was a man <hi>great</hi> in the eſteem and affection of his countrymen. As he loved his country, ſo his country loved him in return. His countrymen were not blind to his merits: They knew—they eſteemed —they <hi>felt</hi> his worth. They looked to him as their deliverer—they loved him as their friend. That he ſhared largely in the eſteem and affection of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, is proved by the tranſactions of this day. Look around on this aſſembly. Is not this numerous aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly a witneſs that WASHINGTON was beloved. Look further: Look to the towns around us, where the people are this day aſſembled. Yea, caſt your eyes over the whole of theſe United States. See the citizens from north to ſouth, aſſembled in various places. For what purpoſe is this, but to teſtify their eſteem—their affection for their friend, and to mourn for the loſs of their WASHINGTON.</p>
            <p>THUS I have mentioned ſome traits of the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of him whoſe loſs we mourn, not becauſe they were unknown, but to remind you that he was <hi>great.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT as great as he was, he was but a man. He was but a frail, mortal man like others. <hi>Know ye not that a great man is fallen in Israel?</hi> A great man is fallen in America. Yes: the wiſe, the brave, the beloved WASHINGTON, has fallen a prey to death. He who remained unhurt in the field of battle, where the blood of the ſlain ran around—he who ſtood un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved at the lightening of the ſpear and the cannon's roar—he is now no more—no more in this world.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037182_0012_100CE3C33388BFC0"/>
No more can we receive his aid and hear his councils. <hi>He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.</hi> His vigorous arm has loſt its ſtrength: his robuſt conſtitution could not ſtand before the king of terrors. His eyes are for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cloſed, his mouth is ſealed in ſolemn ſilence, and his once active limbs, now remain without life or motion. Before his death, much reliance, under God, was placed upon his wiſdom and experience, in caſe our country ſhould again be involved in war. But our expectations of his aſſiſtance, are ſuddenly vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. No more is he to marſhall our troops and lead our armies to victory. The mighty conqueror is conquered by the all-conquering power of death.</p>
            <p>DESCEND, my countrymen, to the lonely tomb— Open the door, harſhly grating on its hinges, look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round the ſolemn apartment, <hi>there</hi> you will find your friend—your benefactor—your father—your WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON. <hi>There</hi> he lies to moulder to his primeval duſt.</p>
            <p>OH! <hi>How is the mighty fallen,</hi> and the man <hi>of war perished!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT is there nothing left of WASHINGTON, but lifeleſs clay? There is more indeed. He lives in the affectionate remembrance of a grateful people, and his name will be handed down, with applauſe, to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations yet unborn. Many of his writings, which contain his parental advice to his country, are yet preſerved. Long may they be preſerved and ſtrictly regarded.</p>

               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:037182_0013_100CD68A05EDD668"/>YEA, more; his ſoul—his noble part, ſtill lives— This has entered another world to exiſt forever, and we humbly hope has joined the happy choir above in aſcribing rapturous praiſe to the Power Divine.</p>
            <q>
               <l>—O WASHINGTON!—</l>
               <l>"Altho' in ſolemn ſilence laid,</l>
               <l>"Among the pale and ſleeping dead,</l>
               <l>"Where neither breeze nor genial ray</l>
               <l>"Pervades the cold encircling clay:</l>
               <l>"Yet—thy name ſhall ſweetly ſound,</l>
               <l>"While yonder circling ſun goes round,</l>
               <l>"Each generous eye its tribute give—</l>
               <l>"And tho' thou art dead, thy fame ſhall live."</l>
            </q>
            <p>How ought we, my hearers, to improve the death of this <hi>great</hi> man, whoſe loſs we mourn. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant that we not only ſhow our reſpect for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed by our publick aſſembly, but that each of us be improved by the providence of God.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſtly. Let the death of WASHINGTON remind us that it is God who gives and takes away bleſſings. All our favours are derived from him who is the giver of every good and perfect gift. It is true that he whoſe death we mourn has been a bleſſing to Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica; yet we ought to adore the giver and not the gift. The Lord was the giver, the man the gift. Let us look to the giver and acknowlege the good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God in beſtowing upon us the able <hi>General</hi> —the wiſe <hi>Statesman</hi>—the great <hi>Patriot.</hi> God raiſed him up as an inſtrument in his hand to perform what he performed. He raiſed him up for important purpoſes to his country and to mankind. Theſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037182_0014_100CE3C4D230D088"/>
are anſwered. Therefore let us bleſs the Lord that he raiſed up WASHINGTON for our country's good. Bleſs the Lord that he protected the man in all dangers of an eventful war—that <hi>he</hi> enabled him to ſerve his country with wiſdom and fidelity. Be thankful that the Governour of the world continued him ſo long an eminent bleſſing to America and to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Inſtead of giving too much glory to the <hi>man,</hi> give the glory to God.—From God he received his talents: To God we owe the praiſe. When he had done the work which God aſſigned him, and arrived to the bounds which God had ſet to his life, he was taken away. The Lord had nothing more for him to do, and therefore continued him no longer in the world. As it is God who hath taken him from us, let us ſeriouſly conſider the hand of God. Infinite <hi>wisdom</hi> directs the wheels of providence. God is actuated by <hi>goodness</hi> in every providence. Therefore it is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the <hi>best</hi> that WASHINGTON is dead.—As God is moſt <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> ſo it is reaſonable that men be ſubmiſſive to <hi>his</hi> will and rejoice that <hi>he</hi> reigns. Had we been to chooſe concerning our deceaſed friend, we ſhould have wiſhed his continuance in the world; but for ſome reaſon his continuance was not for the beſt. Let us realize the hand of God in this inſtance of mortality, and be ready to ſay, <hi>The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away, and blessed be the name of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly. LET the death of WASHINGTON teach us humility. God's providence is juſt. We are a ſinful people. We deſerve the heavy judgments of God.— Great are our national privileges, and we have deſerved that they ſhould be taken from us.—God would be
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037182_0015_100CE3C75964DAC0"/>
juſt if he ſhould take from us our wiſe men and leave us to looſe our liberties and privileges. Let us ſee our ill-deſert, acknowledge our wanderings from God, and humble ourſelves under the mighty hand of the Lord.—</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. LET the death of WASHINGTON remind us that all muſt die. Death is the appointment of heaven. <hi>It is appointed unto all men once to die.</hi> Job knew that the grave is the houſe appointed for all the living.</p>
            <p>MAN is of a frail and dying nature: He is not calculated to remain long in the preſent ſtate. The period will ſoon come when <hi>The keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windowe be darkened</hi>— the period when <hi>The dust shall return to the earth as it was, and the spirit shall return to God who gave it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MEN die to make room for others. So it is with all things: They move in ſucceſſion. The beaſts of the field, the fouls of the air and the fiſh of the ſea, leave the world and are followed by others of their kind. So it is in the vegetable world. The old tree falls and is ſucceeded by new ones. In autumn the foreſt is deſpoiled of its foliage; the ſpring returns, and the foreſt is again clothed in green.</p>
            <p>That all muſt die, we may know by obſervation. How many thouſands have lived to former days? Tho' once buſy on this ſtage of action, they are now laid in mouldering duſt. Where are the mighty
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037182_0016_100CE3C997918220"/>
Generals, the admired Heroes and the Legiſlators of ancient times? Tho' they were accounted as Gods; yet they have died like men, and lie on a level with others. How many ſince our day have left the ſhores of time! How often are we called to attend the funerals of our friends and aquaintance, and to lay them in the narrow houſe? One falls on our right and another on our left, and are committed to their native duſt.</p>
            <p>A MAN's riches cannot bribe the king of terrors, nor can his poverty plead in his behalf. The rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared ſumptuouſly every day, died and was buried. The beggar who lay at his gate full of ſores, fell a prey to death.</p>
            <p>A MAN's friends cannot extend the bounds of life. <hi>No man can redeem himself or his brother.</hi> The dying look to their friends, and affecting is the ſcene, their friends are unable to relieve.</p>
            <p>PHYSICIANS are called around the bed of death, but death baffles their ſkill. They are made uſe of as inſtruments to preſerve life untill men arrive to the bounds which God hath ſet, then all their means are in vain.</p>
            <p>A MAN's uſefulneſs ſaves him not. There are many men who by their councils, their exertions and examples are of great ſervice to the world. But even theſe muſt be called from their uſefulneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:037182_0017_100CE3CBAA12D020"/>A MAN may live long compared with the lives of ſome others: he may have an excellent good conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, enjoy healthful days, and, more than others, be a ſtranger to pain and ſickneſs: he may enjoy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny friends and be loved and careſſed by them. He may add houſe to houſe and poſſeſs fields without number—may become exceedingly rich. He may have great honour and applauſe. He may riſe from a low ſtate to great dignity and honours: like the ſon of the Blackſmith who in the reign of Henry VIII. ſtood next to the throne in temporal glory.—</p>
            <p>HE may become a great Lawgiver, ſuch as was Moſes of Iſrael, the Aſſyrian Ninus, the Seſoſtris of Egypt, the Cyrus of Perſia, the Alexander of Greece, the Caeſar of Rome, the Conde of France, the Charles of Sweden, the Peter of Ruſſia, and the WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON of America. A man may be inveſted with pomp and ſurrounded with the guards of royalty: his pomp may dazzle and his power may awe mankind. But after all he muſt ſubmit to the great traveller, death. <hi>Behold,</hi> ſays the Pſalmiſt, <hi>thou hast made my days as an hand's breadth, and mine age is as nothing before thee: Verily man at his best state is altogether vanity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF a good and robuſt conſtitution—if great abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, inviolable integrity and ſtrict morality—if ſtrong love to one's country and eminent uſefulneſs—if great eſteem and applauſe—if wiſdom and prudence in the field and cabinet—if able phyſicians—if many friends and the ſincere affection of one's countrymen —if any one of theſe or if all of them could ſave from death, WASHINGTON had been ſpared: For
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037182_0018_100CE3CE792BB248"/>
theſe, no doubt, he poſſeſſed. Who then can hope to be exempted? None—none indeed.</p>
            <p>"SHOULD we, as one expreſſes, carry our thoughts hence to the ſepulchres of the great, or to ſome hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble burying ground," we might ſee that death con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers all. <hi>"There</hi> lie in promiſcuous ruin, the rich and the poor; the baſe and the brave; the honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and the deſpiſed. There ſleep the infant and the man of days; blooming youth and decayed age.— There reſts deformity unmoleſted: There moulders beauty unnoticed. There find a place proud mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs who have changed the ſplendours of a palace for the humble lodging of the grave. There too are found the leſs noiſy but more uſeful individuals of mankind, the friends, and benefactors of the world. Thoſe ſages, who expelled ignorance from wretched mortals, thoſe benefactors, who relieved their wants, there mingle with the vulgar throng. There lies the philoſopher, whoſe mind had traverſed nature; there ſleeps the man of taſte, whoſe imagination had given birth to new worlds of beauty; there reſts the friend to humanity, whoſe heart never failed to ſympathize with the child of ſorrow. Even the real Chriſtian whoſe boſom once glowed with the ſacred flame of piety, whoſe life was a tranſcript of his ſaviour's cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, ſlumbers in that gloomy repoſitory. At the call of death, the merchant quits his favourite ſchemes; and the patriot his exertions for the publick good. He whoſe thoughts are wholly taken up with ſome lucrative or honourable employment, finds no reſpite. The friend to human kind, the patriot on whom the welfare of his country depends, obtains no releaſe.— While his boſom ſwells with the pleaſure of diffuſing
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037182_0019_100CE3D012869978"/>
happineſs among his fellow men; while his mind is big with projects for advancing their felicity, the awful ſummons arrives, and puts a period to his exertions."</p>
            <p>IN theſe United States, how many, even the laſt year, have fallen a prey to death! Not only many citizens of the common rank; but more than uſual of rulers and ſuperiors have bid us a long farewell. By accounts which have been received, it appears that the following are ſome of the number:</p>

               <p>YOU are ſenſible that WASHINGTON was a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonic brother. And as he ſuſtained an eminent office in the lodge, ſo it is evident that maſonry received no ſmall ſhare of his attention. Is maſonry then "fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous?" Was WASHINGTON a man of dignity e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where elſe, and a child in the lodge? Is maſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry calculated to make men thirſt for licentious liberty and diſorganization? Has not WASHINGTON ſpent his life in the ſupport of order and good government? Has he not manifeſted his regard to the Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and morality? Would he approve and ſupport the maſonic inſtitution in caſe it were inconſiſtent with good government, order, religion and morality? No—the character of WASHINGTON was uniform and conſiſtent. But you already know the nature of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonry. It is ſuch as WASHINGTON was not aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to approve. But no more will he meet with his brethren in this world—no more will he ſupport them—no more will he give them his wiſe inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and his parental advice—no more will he aſſiſt in raiſing the fallen, and no more will his noble ſoul aid his brethren in alleviating the diſtreſſes of the

unfortunate. For he has bid adieu to the ſociety of mortals.</p>
               <p>No doubt you feel the loſs: for in his death you have loſt a great benefactor, a noble friend, and a worthy brother. Since he is gone, let us remember that it is the Lord's doing and acquieſce in the bereaving providence. Since he has travelled through the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of life, to return no more, let it be remembered that we alſo are travelling to that country from whoſe bourne no traveller returns. Soon the thread of our life will be ſevered by the ſcythe of time. Soon the ſands of our glaſs will be run out, and we muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the deceaſed brother to the grave, where all are level.</p>
               <p>SUFFER me then to urge you to live as travellers to another world. Entertain ſupreme affection to the Great I Am: reverence the name of Jehovah: truſt in the Lord; and travel by the unerring light of God's holy word. If you do this, you will be ſafely conducted through the wilderneſs of this world—your feet will be guided in the path of holineſs and peace. If you do this, you will hold the balance of juſtice in equal poize, walk by the plumb line of uprightneſs, be reſtrained within the compaſs of duty, ſquare your actions by the rules of equity, and bring forth the fruits of Chriſtian benevolence. Cultivate a ſpirit of friendſhip and humanity, after the example of that ſincere friend and humane brother whoſe death you mourn. After his example alſo be lovers of your country, ſupporters of its conſtitution, engaged in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of order and good government, and never weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in promoting the publick weal.</p>

               <p>As WASHINGTON was once eminent in the civil department, ſo you may well feel his loſs. No more will our civil affairs be directed by him. But let it be remembered that our civil affairs are in the hands of God, and he is able to aſſiſt others to ſerve their country with fidelity in the civil office. Much of our country's welfare, depends, under God, upon the civil authority. Unleſs the civil authority be faithful to their truſt and vigilant in ſeeing that the laws are obeyed, our laws will be, in a great meaſure, in vain— our liberty will be abuſed and degenerated into ſad licentiouſneſs—yea our religion will mourn and vice will triumph. If therefore our laws be worthy of notice—if our rights and liberties be worth preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and if religion be of any importance in regard to
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:037182_0023_100CE3D8D4DDC430"/>
our country's welfare or to our eternal peace, much depends on the civil authority. It is through the good providence of God that we have gained our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties: this has been done, however, with arduous ſtruggles and at the expence of the blood of many a brave American. We have now order, peace and good laws eſtabliſhed—yea, we enjoy our religion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moleſted—we may ſet under our own vines and fig-trees without any to make us afraid. Is it not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant then for us to hold our liberty precious, to obey our laws and revere our religion? Without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion there can be no <hi>good</hi> civil government—with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>form</hi> of religion <hi>none</hi> will long remain.</p>
               <p>To you, my fathers, we look as guardians of our rights, defenders of our laws, and ſupporters of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Though I pretend not to much knowledge in civil affairs, and though I would not preſume to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect you in your office; yet, permit me humbly to ſuggeſt the importance that our laws be duly obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reſpecting morality and the Chriſtian ſabbath. I need not enlarge on the importance of morality and the ſabbath: you feel their importance. They are important if we look to the good of our government, the good of our nation, the good of ourſelves, or the good of our children. And who ſhall watch over us and puniſh the immoral peſt of ſociety and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbing ſabbath breaker, if not our civil magiſtrates? The civil magiſtrate acts for God and is accountable to him. <hi>The powers that are, are ordained of God.</hi> Good <hi>Rulers are not a terror to good works but to evil.</hi> How important is it then that the civil ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate be firm and ſtedfaſt in the diſcharge of his truſt. WASHINGTON was unſhaken, when execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the laws of his country. Long may we have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates wiſe and firm like WASHINGTON. Long may we have them, who ſhall be a terror to evil do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and a praiſe to them who do well. Long may we have them, who ſhall hold ſacred our rights and liberties—our laws and our religion. Long may we have them in office, who love our country like WASHINGTON, who are fearers of God, and faithful in the diſcharge of their duty.</p>
               <p>MY fathers, may the Lord be with you, and ſanctify to you the death of him whoſe loſs you mourn; may God grant you wiſdom and aſſiſtance in your impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſtation, and long continue you rich bleſſings to your fellow-citizens and promoters of your country's welfare.</p>

               <p>No man in America nor perhaps in the world has been as famous as WASHINGTON for his military talents. During the greateſt part of our revolutionary war, he held the firſt military office, and executed it in ſuch a maſterly manner as to gain the applause of his country, and the wonder of the world. Such was his wiſdom as to baffle the skill and the art of the enemy who were commanded by the wiſeſt and moſt experienced generals, of whom England had to boaſt. Such was his bravery in the field, as cauſed proud Britons to flee before him. Such was his authority, that his inferior officers and ſoldiers obeyed him with promptitude, and ſuch was his mildneſs and condeſcention that they loved and revered him. So irreproachable was his character as a general, that I
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:037182_0025_100CD685E87C8468"/>
know not that even his moſt inveterate enemies dared to utter a ſyllable derogatory to his military character. He ſilenced the voice of envy and ſtruck dumb the tongue of calumny. How did you rejoice—how did his ſoldiers rejoice—how did all America rejoice, when the brave Veteran accepted his laſt appointment to take the charge of our new raiſed troops. But Oh! ſad reverſe! He has reſigned his commiſſion. No more do you look to him as your leader. He has paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the vale, whence there is no returning. In him you have loſt your military chief—your wonderful hero.—In his death the ſoldiers have loſt their military father, their friend and general. Should America, perchance, be again involved in war, and ſhould any of you be called to the field of battle, would you not wiſh to ſee your WASHINGTON at your head? But you will ſee him not. No more will the enemy fear him —no more will you follow him to face the enemy. <hi>More</hi> then is to be done by his ſucceſſors. Let me exhort you to follow the example of WASHINGTON in your military office. If ever you ſhould be called to defend your country, think how <hi>he</hi> would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted and do likewiſe. If you have wiſdom like him your arrangements will be good and probably ſucceed. If you have dignity and authority like him, your ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers will reſpect and obey you. If you have humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and lenity like him, they will love you as their friend. If you have prudence like him the enemy will ſcarcely gain an advantage. If you have bravery like him, you may expect a glorious victory.—But may God avert the calamity of war from our country: may he forbid that you ſhould ever have occaſion to enter the field of battle. May you never have occaſion to go thro' the dangers, thro' which WASHINGTON has
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:037182_0026_100CE3DF391309C8"/>
gone.—ſhould, however, the din of war be heard in our land, and ſhould the good of your country call you to battle, ſhrink not from the undertaking. Rally round your country's ſtandard, haſte away to meet the enemy and bravely defend your rights and liberties, your lives and property, your wives and children. Let the love of liberty, the love of your country, the love of your families, fire your ſouls to action. Remember WASHINGTON: What he did was honourable.</p>
               <p>LOOK to the God of war, make your peace with him, engage him on your ſide, and you will have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to fear. <hi>If God be for us, who can be against us?</hi> May the Lord give you his bleſſing: may he continue peace in our land and proſperity in our dwellings, ſo that you may long taſte the ſweets of retired life, and thro' life enjoy domeſtic happineſs; may God enable you to fight the good fight of faith, war the Chriſtian warfare with ſucceſs, and when time is no more beſtow upon you a crown of joy as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of ſpiritual victory.</p>
               <p>ALL that remains, is to addreſs the citizens in general, of this numerous aſſembly.</p>

                  <salute>MY Fellow-Citizens and Countrymen,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>WASHINGTON was once a private citizen. Yea, he rejoiced in being a citizen of the free and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſtates of America. Whenever his country would give conſent, he retired to the life of a private citizen. In this character he did honour to his country.—As a citizen he was obedient to the laws of our land and a ſupporter of the government under which we live. In private life, he was attentive to husbandry and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:037182_0027_100CE3E166426348"/>
concerns: He was tender and affectionate to his family, kind and obliging to his friends and forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his enemies.</p>
               <p>BUT America no more calls him her citizen. He has become the citizen of another country. As his death is our loſs as citizens, ſo we may with propriety notice the mournful event. It is important that we alſo be ſuitably improved by it.</p>
               <p>LET us candidly attend to WASHINGTON's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and regard his councils, for he was our friend. Let us pray the Father of mercies, that his ſucceſſors in office may be enabled to ſerve their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with that wiſdom and fidelity as <hi>he</hi> hath done. Our publick affairs are in the hands of God, and it is important that we ſupplicate his favour to our national concerns. And let us pay a ſtrict regard to the laws of the land in which we live. <hi>Let every soul be subject to the higher powers: for there is no power but of God: the powers that be, are ordained of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BY this inſtance of mortality, which has called us together, let us be reminded of the vanity of all things below the ſun.—Nothing on earth is permanent: One generation goeth, and another cometh. Be reminded of the inſufficiency of all things here below, to make us truly happy. Since this world is vanity, <hi>Set your affections on things above, not on things on the earth.</hi> Of what value now is this world to WASHINGTON. None indeed. "How lov'd, how valued once, avails him not." Let us then lay up treaſure in heaven, where is genuine happineſs and durable joy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="unknown:037182_0028_100CE3E46A8C8460"/>SINCE WASHINGTON is dead, let us reflect on our own mortality. Death knocks equally at the doors of palaces and cottages. Others die around us: Soon it will be our turn. Yes, each of us in this aſſembly muſt ſoon lie in ſolemn ſilence beneath the duſt.—</p>
               <q>
                  <l>In reſpect to us,</l>
                  <l>"Soon ſome aquaintance, mournfully will ſay,</l>
                  <l>"Here ſleeps my friend, once active, young &amp; gay,</l>
                  <l>"Now cold in death; beneath the duſt he lies,</l>
                  <l>"Silent his voice, forever clos'd his eyes;</l>
                  <l>"The immortal part, has on ſwift pinions flown,</l>
                  <l>"To take its ſentence, in the world unknown."</l>
               </q>
               <p>Our time is ſhort. Day after day and year after year, roll almoſt imperceptibly away, and carry us onward to the cloſe of life. If we live even to old age, we ſhall find the time to be ſhort. While time is paſſing it is apt to ſeem long: hours often hang heavily upon us, and we drag the tedious load of life. But time when paſt appears ſhort indeed. When an old man looks back on his paſt life, it appears like a dream, or in the expreſſive language of inſpiration, <hi>Like the morning cloud and the early dew which soon passeth away.</hi>—What are ſixty or eighty years, when compared with the lives of the Patriarchs, who lived eight or nine hundred years?—What are they, when compared with the time elapſed ſince the days of Adam, which is about ſix thouſand years? Or what are theſe ſixty or eighty years, when compared with eternity! Eternity, vaſt boundleſs eternity, will never end. Oh! let us realize the ſhortneſs of our time!</p>
               <p>IF the lives of the old be ſhort, how much ſhorter ſtill are the lives of many others! It is computed by ſome, that one third of the human race die under the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:037182_0029_100CE3E669168630"/>
age of one year, and nearly one half under the age of five years. Many are cut off in the vigour of life and in the bloom of youth.—How few—how very few live till old age! The frailty of human nature is proved by daily experience.</p>
               <p>IT appears that WASHINGTON, a few days before his death, was robuſt and healthy; but how ſoon is he laid pale and lifeleſs! Oh! how precarious are all things here below! Why—why will we not realize the uncertainty of our lives?</p>
               <p>Is our time ſhort, and are our lives uncertain? then let us not miſpend our time. Why ſhould we trifle it away? Why ſhould we not think of our danger before death ſtares us in the face? Why will we ſail quietly down the rapid ſtream of life till we be unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly launched forth into the boundleſs ocean of eternity?</p>
               <p>Is WASHINGTON no more? then let us be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to prepare to die. Preparation for death is the great end of life. Death is the object which we ſhould keep in our view.—God's warnings to us are many and various. His word and providence are ſolemn warnings. By the frequent deaths of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, friends and aquaintance—by the deaths of our rulers—yea, by the ſudden death of our WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, God ſpeaks in expreſſive language, <hi>Be ye also ready.</hi> O my countrymen, let us watch and pray for we know not what hour our Lord doth come. <hi>One thing is needful.</hi> Religion is, of all things elſe, moſt neceſſary.
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:037182_0030_100CE3E7FACBD588"/>
Let us chuſe this good part which ſhall never be taken from us.</p>
               <p>AFTER death comes the judgment. Yes; the day is coming, when the ſound of the laſt trump, ſhall vibrate through the univerſe—the day, when the dead ſhall be raiſed and the living be changed—the day, when we ſhall behold the great funeral of nature, the earth diſſolving and the elements melting with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent heat—the great day, when we ſhall ariſe to the bar of God. Then may we be found among the friends of Jeſus, receive the approbation of our Judge, and through the Redeemer, be welcomed to blisful ſeats of never—never ending joy.</p>
