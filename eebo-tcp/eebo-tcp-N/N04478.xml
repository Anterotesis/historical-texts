            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

religious Man, a true Worſhipper of the true GOD. He was born indeed of <hi>Gentile</hi> Parents; and, 'tis probable, they educated him in the <hi>Superſtitions</hi> and <hi>Idolatries</hi> of the <hi>Pagan</hi> Nations. But theſe he renounced, and became a <hi>Proſelyte</hi> to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion; acknowledging the GOD of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be the true GOD, and worſhipping him as ſuch, according to the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Inſtitution, with an upright Heart.</p>
            <p>He did not worſhip he <hi>knew not what.</hi> His Devotion would then have been blind, and nothing better than <hi>Superſtition.</hi> So the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> told the <hi>Athenians,</hi> when he ſaw them paying their Devotions to an unknown Object. <hi>Ye Men of</hi> Athens, (ſays he, <hi>Acts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </gap> all Things ye are too ſuperſtitious. For as I paſſed by, and beheld your Devotions, I found an Altar with this Inſcription,</hi> TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. <hi>Whom therefore ye ignorantly worſhip, him declare I unto you.</hi> Neither did he miſtake the <hi>proper Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> of Worſhip; doing Service to an <hi>Idol,</hi> inſtead of the GOD who made Heaven and Earth, and is over all GOD bleſſed for ever: He would then have deſerved the Character of an <hi>idolatrous,</hi> not a pious devout Man. But the Being he did Homage to was the GOD of the <hi>Univerſe,</hi> the GOD of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the <hi>one true</hi> and <hi>living</hi> GOD; beſides whom there is no other ſutable Object of religious Adoration.</p>
            <p>And he worſhipped the true GOD according to <hi>his own Appointments.</hi> 'Tis true, he does not appear to have been what the <hi>Jews</hi> call, a <hi>Proſelyte of the Covenant,</hi> i. e. one who had ſubmitted to <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> and the <hi>whole Moſaic Inſtitutions,</hi> and was counted as a <hi>Jew,</hi> and converſed with as ſuch. But he ſo far embraced <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> as to make the <hi>Old-Teſtament-Revelation</hi> the <hi>Rule</hi> of his Worſhip. He was no obſerver either of <hi>Heatheniſh Rites</hi> or <hi>Jewiſh Traditions.</hi> He did not go about to <hi>invent</hi> Methods of pleaſing GOD, as tho' thoſe of his own inſtituting were not ſufficient. This
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005556_0006_101867295365CA30"/>
indeed has been too much the Way of the World in all paſt Ages, and is ſo at this Day. The <hi>Church of Rome</hi> has inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Pilgrimages, Penances, Proceſſions,</hi> and numberleſs other Superſtitions; adding them to thoſe Exerciſes of Piety the <hi>Scripture</hi> has pointed out: Yea, they have introduced the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and an hundred other Saints both dead and alive, as ſo many <hi>Mediums</hi> of Approach to the divine Majeſty, to the great Diſhonour, if not Excluſion, of JESUS the <hi>one Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator between God and Man.</hi> And what Multitudes of poor deluded People are there, who think themſelves, and would be tho't by others, eminently devout and pious, becauſe they are religiouſly ſtrict in theſe and ſuch like Obſervances? CORNELIUS'S Devotion was not of this Kind. He ſacredly adhered to the Preſcriptions of the <hi>Bible;</hi> thinking it enough, if he exerciſed himſelf in thoſe Acts of Religion GOD had <hi>appointed.</hi> Theſe he looked upon as bearing the Stamp of divine Authority; and theſe he obſerved, hoping for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Bleſſing of his Maker.</p>
            <p>And as he worſhipped the true GOD in his own Way, ſo he took Care to do it with an <hi>honeſt Mind,</hi> having a <hi>ſingle Eye to the divine Glory.</hi> He did not honour GOD with his Lips, while his Heart was far from him; he did not flatter him with his Mouth, or lie to him with his Tongue, his Heart not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing right with him: But he was ſincere in his religious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances; the Man <hi>inwardly</hi> he ſeemed to be <hi>outwardly.</hi> He did not put on Religion as a Cloak, nor wear the Form of it becauſe it was the Faſhion; but he had a real Regard for GOD, and from this Principle obſerved his <hi>Sabbath,</hi> went up to his <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> and attended the Duties of his <hi>Worſhip.</hi> Nor did he content himſelf with the <hi>outward</hi> Exerciſes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but his chief Concern was with his Heart, that he might <hi>inwardly</hi> honour GOD by unfeigned Acts of Faith in him, Love to him and Dependance on him.</p>

Thus CORNELIUS was a <hi>devout,</hi> i. e. a pious religious Man. But the Text is particular in mentioning two obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable Inſtances of his <hi>Piety</hi> or <hi>Devotion;</hi> his <hi>fearing God with all his Houſe, and his praying always.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> Inſtance is, his <hi>fearing God with all his Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this <hi>Fear of</hi> GOD, we muſt not underſtand that Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs of Mind, which is the Reſult of an Apprehenſion of him, as <hi>meerly</hi> a powerful and angry Being. This is a wrong Notion of the DEITY. And a Fear of him ariſing from ſuch a falſe Conception, is nothing better than ſuperſtitious Awe and Dread.</p>
            <p>Neither by this <hi>Fear of</hi> GOD are we to underſtand that <hi>Perturbation of Mind,</hi> which is founded on Conſideration of thoſe many Sins, whereby we have expos'd our ſelves to the divine Reſentments. This indeed is a reaſonable <hi>Fear of</hi> GOD; tho' whenever Men, thro' a Senſe of Sin, ſo employ their Thoughts on his <hi>ſeverer</hi> Attributes, as to forget his <hi>milder</hi> Ones, eſpecially as he has made a Repreſentation of them in the Goſpel of his SON JESUS CHRIST; and are ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with a Dread of his <hi>Anger,</hi> as to have no Hope in his Mercy, this is meer <hi>Horror of Soul,</hi> founded on falſe Ideas of GOD, ſuch as are neither fetched from <hi>Reaſon,</hi> nor <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi> And the Tendency of it is, not to bring Men to GOD by Repentance, but to drive them away from him thro' Fright and Deſpair.</p>
            <p>But beſides theſe Senſes of the <hi>Fear of God,</hi> there is yet another; <abbr>

pleaſe GOD, and reſtrains them from every Thing offenſive to him, or that would argue a Neglect or Contempt of him. This is that <hi>filial</hi> Fear of GOD which is ſo much celebrated in the <hi>Scripture:</hi> And in this Senſe it was, that CORNELIUS <hi>feared him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He had upon his Mind an habitual Awe of GOD; not ſuch an one as drove him from his <hi>Preſence;</hi> not ſuch an one as made his Life uncomfortable to him: But his Reverence of the divine Majeſty was mixed with Love to him, and a <hi>Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like</hi> Confidence in him. And it had a powerful Tendency to keep him from every Thing diſreſpectful towards GOD, either in Thought, Speech or Behaviour; and to put him upon expreſſing the loweſt Proſtration both of Body and Soul before him: As in Children who have in their Minds a true Fear of their <hi>Parents;</hi> the Influence of this Paſſion is not to fill them with a flaviſh uneaſy Dread, but it tends rather to engage their Care to behave towards them with all dutiful Submiſſion.</p>
            <p>'Tis added in Commendation of CORNELIUS'S <hi>Fear of God,</hi> that it had a good influence upon his whole Family. <hi>He feared God with his whole Houſe.</hi> His Religion was not confin'd to himſelf; but all under his Roof were the better for it. It may be, they alſo <hi>feared God.</hi> It was the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſeveral pious Men in that Day, to have their <hi>whole Houſes</hi> converted together with themſelves, and brought over to the Profeſſion of the true Religion. So we read of the <hi>Noble-man</hi> at <hi>Capernaum,</hi> (<hi>John</hi> 4. 5<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.) that he <hi>himſelf believed, and his Houſe;</hi> and of <hi>Criſpus</hi> the Ruler of the Synagogue, (<hi>Acts</hi> 18. 8.) that he <hi>believed on the Lord with all his Houſe.</hi> And 'tis a Salutation ſometimes to be met with in the Epiſtles, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 19.) <hi>To ſuch an one, and the Church in his Houſe;</hi> importing, that the Family was converted, as it were, into a <hi>Church</hi> of CHRIST. And 'tis poſſible, this might be the Caſe
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005556_0009_101867303B5B0D98"/>
of CORNELIUS'S Family. His Piety might have an Influence, under the divine Bleſſing, to diffuſe Religion thro' his whole Houſe. Or however this was, as became a true <hi>Fearer of God,</hi> he took all proper Care, that his Family might be a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious</hi> One. He, no doubt, inſtructed them in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and urg'd them to the Service of GOD: He, no doubt, ſet up the Worſhip of the GOD of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in his Family; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving with <hi>Joſhua</hi> of Old, <hi>As for me and my Houſe, we will ſerve the Lord:</hi> He, no doubt, diſcouraged the out-breaking of Sin in his Children and Servants; warning them againſt it, and laying the Reſtraints of his Authority upon their Luſts and Vices: He, no doubt, carried them to the Throne of Mercy, humbly and fervently praying to GOD for them, and teaching them to pray to him themſelves: Nor can it be ſuppoſed but he recommended Religion to their Love and Practice, from his own <hi>exemplary</hi> good Converſation.</p>
            <p>And what a noble Evidence was this of the Truth of his Piety? 'Tis particularly mentioned to <hi>Abraham'</hi>s Honour, and as <hi>that</hi> whereby GOD knew him to be a pious holy Man, that he took all ſutable Care to promote Religion in his <hi>Family. I know him</hi> (ſays God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 19.), <hi>that he will command his Children and his Houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep the Way of the Lord, to do Juſtice and Judgment.</hi> And the like Commendation is here given of CORNELIUS, whereby he is declared to be a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> a Partaker of his virtuous Diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>The next Inſtance the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> gives of CORNELIUS'S Piety, is, <hi>his praying always.</hi> Not that he ſpent his whole Time in praying. This he could not do; it was not conſiſtent with the Frame of his Nature, nor with many Duties that are neceſſary as well as Prayer: But the Meaning is, he was a Man of Prayer, diſpos'd to the Duty, and much us'd to the Practice of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:005556_0010_10186738BAD5D808"/>
He <hi>prayed always,</hi> i. e. He was always in a Frame for Prayer; habitually inclined to this noble Exerciſe of Piety. He was ever ready to open his Lips, that he might make known his Requeſts to GOD. This was the ſettled perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Diſpoſition of his Mind.</p>
            <p>He <hi>prayed always,</hi> i. e. It was his frequent Practice, the daily Employment of his Life. With the devout <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> he began and ended the Day with GOD; ſhewing forth his Loving-Kindneſs in the Morning, and his Faithfulneſs every Night. And 'tis obſervable, the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> which GOD ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be <hi>daily</hi> offered in the <hi>Morning</hi> and in the <hi>Evening,</hi> is called the <hi>continual Burnt-offering</hi> (Numb. 28. 6.); and for the ſame Reaſon, and with like Propriety, Prayers <hi>daily</hi> put up to GOD, <hi>Morning</hi> and <hi>Evening,</hi> may be called <hi>continual praying, praying always.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He <hi>prayed always,</hi> i. e. upon all proper and fit Occaſions. He did not confine himſelf to ſtated Seaſons for Prayer; but ey'd the Face of Providence, and betook himſelf to GOD in humble Supplication, as new Occaſions called for it. He, no doubt, had his Days of more ſolemn Prayer, in a Way of <hi>Humiliation</hi> and <hi>Thankſgiving,</hi> as his <hi>own</hi> Circumſtances, or the Affairs of the <hi>Public,</hi> made them ſeaſonable and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. Nor was he a Stranger to <hi>Ejaculatory</hi> Prayer. We may rather ſuppoſe, it was his Practice, in this Way, to lift up his Heart to GOD in devout Acknowledgments, as freſh Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were offered therefor, from what he daily met with in the Courſe of Providence.</p>
            <p>He <hi>prayed always,</hi> i. e. he prayed and did not faint; he prayed without growing weary of the Duty. He did not, as the Manner of ſome is, practice it for a while, and then lay it aſide; but <hi>continued in Supplication, watching thereunto with all Perſeverance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:005556_0011_1018673D1AD68F48"/>
And, I may add, he ſo prayed, with ſuch Faith, Humility, Sincerity, Submiſſion and holy Fervour of Soul, that his Prayers were graciouſly accepted of GOD. So he was aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the <hi>Angel of the Lord,</hi> who ſaid unto him (Context v. 4.), <hi>thy Prayers are come up for a Memorial before God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have ſet before you the Character of CORNELIUS, as a <hi>devout religious Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And have we not reaſon herefrom to reflect upon our ſelves with Grief and Shame, that we fall ſo far below him in true Piety? The beſt of us all may bluſh, while we ſee our ſelves reproved by the <hi>Example</hi> of one, whoſe Attainments in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion were ſo conſiderable, under ſmaller Advantages than ours, who, from Children, have been favoured with the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and all the external Privileges of the Kingdom of GOD. O how languid is our Devotion! How ſlight the Awe of our Minds towards the divine Majeſty! How feeble its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence to reſtrain and govern us! How cold and lifeleſs are our Prayers! How remiſs our Endeavours to promote Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, either in <hi>our Selves,</hi> or our <hi>Houſes!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And are there not thoſe who give too much Reaſon to be lamented over, as having no true <hi>Fear of</hi> GOD before their Eyes? Why elſe are they ſo indifferent to the Duties of Piety? Why do they ſo often prophane the <hi>Name,</hi> and caſt Contempt upon the <hi>Day</hi> and <hi>Sanctuary</hi> of GOD? Why elſe are they ſo indiſpoſed to <hi>Prayer,</hi> and ſeldom engaged in this neceſſary Exerciſe of Religion? It may be, there are ſome who never in all their Life entred into their Cloſets, to put up a Prayer to almighty GOD! And can it be ſaid of ſuch, that they reverence their Maker? If Men <hi>reſtrain Prayer before</hi> GOD, 'tis a ſad Sign they have <hi>caſt off the Fear of him.</hi> (Job 15. 4.) And to this alſo it is owing, that ſo little Religion, or good Order, is to be ſeen in many of the Families of the preſent Age. How uninſtructed are their Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants?
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005556_0012_1018673F39D9C4C8"/>
How unuſed to good Counſel and ſerious Advice? How let alone to go on in the Ways of Sin, without Correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Reſtraint? And are there no Families where GOD was never worſhipped? Are there no Families, where the <hi>Heads</hi> of them, inſtead of Religion, encourage Vice by their evil Example, by their Prophaneſs, their Intemperance, their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, their Pride, their ungovern'd Wrath and Paſſion? How unlike are ſuch to devout CORNELIUS, <hi>who feared</hi> GOD <hi>with his whole Houſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O ſee your ſelves condemned by his Example! And let me perſwade you from it to <hi>fear God your ſelves,</hi> and then to do what you can to poſſeſs your <hi>whole Houſes</hi> of the like religious Temper of Mind.</p>
            <p>Charity, we ſay, begins at home. Your Religion, be ſure, muſt do ſo. See to it that you be <hi>yourſelves</hi> Men of true Piety and Devotion; and approve yourſelves ſuch, by a conſtant Attendance on all the divine Appointments.—<hi>Exerciſe your ſelves to Godlineſs;</hi> but take Care that it be'nt that <hi>bodily Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe which profiteth little.</hi>—Don't content yourſelves with an <hi>external Shew;</hi> Don't obſerve the Inſtitutions of Religion meerly to <hi>be ſeen of Men:</hi> But look well to your <hi>Aims,</hi> that they be <hi>good;</hi> and to your <hi>Hearts,</hi> that they be <hi>ſincere.</hi> Take diligent Heed, that you may ſerve the Lord with all your Heart, and with all your Soul; for the Lord ſearcheth the Heart, and hath Pleaſure in Uprightneſs.</p>
            <p>And being religious <hi>your ſelves,</hi> give Proof that you are ſo by ſutable Endeavours to promote Religion in your <hi>Families.</hi> Like CORNELIUS, <hi>Fear God with your whole Houſe.</hi> Let this be your faithful diligent Endeavour.</p>
            <p>You can in no other Way expect <hi>Comfort</hi> in your Families. If <hi>Family-Religion</hi> is neglected, what may be looked for but an untowardly Temper and Conduct, in the ſeveral Members of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005556_0013_1018674269D3EE78"/>
it? The Effect whereof muſt be Diſorder, Vexation, and Trouble: Whereas, if Religion is duly kept up in the Family, it will powerfully tend to correct the bad Diſpoſitions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Children or Servants, and engage them to behave well in their reſpective Places. And if this, under the divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, ſhould be the Effect, what happy Families ſhould we have? GOD would delight to dwell in them, to do them Good and not Evil.</p>
            <p>And 'tis a Matter of vaſt Importance to the <hi>Public,</hi> that Religion be maintained in <hi>Families;</hi> eſpecially that the <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> in them be well inſtructed and governed. Their <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil</hi> Behaviour, when they are grown up, and gone forth into the World, will very much depend upon the Care that has been taken of them, while <hi>Children</hi> in the Family. If they have been early taught the Principles of Virtue; if their Minds have been betimes impreſſed with the Fear of GOD; if, from their firſt coming to a Capacity of <hi>moral</hi> Conduct, they have been kept under Reſtraints from Sin; if they have, all along as they grew up, had a good Example ſet before them, there will be a happy Proſpect of their riſing up a Generation to ſeek and ſerve the Lord. Theſe are the Children that are the Hopes of a Country, and of whom it may be expected they will be Bleſſings in the World. Whereas, on the other Hand, if they are neglected, little or no Care taken to engage them for GOD, and inure them to the Exerciſes of Religion, what may be expected but that they ſhould prove the <hi>Troublers of Iſrael?</hi> And the evil Effects of their bad Education may be of laſting Continuance. For, when thoſe Children who have not been trained up in the Ways of Piety, come to have Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren themſelves, 'tis moſt probable they will neglect them, take no Care to plant in their Minds the Seeds of Religion; and, by this Means, the Generation which ſprings out of their Loins will be likely to tread in their Steps, and ſo Vice and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005556_0014_101867459D73FA60"/>
Ignorance, Prophaneſs and Irreligion, will deſcend from Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to Children's Children, GOD only knows how long.</p>
            <p>In a Word, 'tis a great Charge that is devolved on you who have the chief Direction of Families. You are, in a Meaſure, accountable for the Souls of your <hi>whole Houſes</hi> as well as your own. And the Day is coming, it haſtens apace, it lingers not, when it will certainly be demanded of you, what Care you have taken to walk in your Houſe with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Heart; what Pains you have been at to train up your Children and Servants for GOD; what Inſtructions, Counſels and Warnings you have given them; what Prayers you have put up to GOD for them: And if it ſhould then appear, that you neither ſerved GOD, <hi>your ſelves,</hi> nor endeavoured that your <hi>Families</hi> might do ſo; But neglected their Souls, as well as your own: You won't be able to anſwer it to GOD, or them. If thro' your Neglect of <hi>Family-Religion,</hi> or, what is worſe, the Influence of your bad <hi>Family-Example,</hi> your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren or Servants ſhould periſh in another World, O what a doleful Account would you have to give up at the Bar of CHRIST! And ſhould any of them there charge upon you the Ruin of their Souls, could you be able to bear up under it? Don't the Fore-thought of ſuch an Accuſation ſtrike you with ſhuddering Horror?—<hi>But, Beloved, we are perſwaded better Things of you, and Things that accompany Salvation; tho' we thus ſpeak.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. The next Thing obſervable in CORNELIUS'S Character is, his <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> towards Men, together with the <hi>good Reputation</hi> he had gained in the World.</p>
            <p>He was a Man of <hi>Charity;</hi> ready to diſtribute, willing to communicate: And he was large and generous in his Diſtributions. So the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> deſcribes him, <hi>Which gave much Alms to the People.</hi> He does not appear to have been a Man of a vaſt Income; but yet, in Proportion to what he had, he did
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005556_0015_101867472377C5E0"/>
a great deal for the Poor. 'Tis probable, he lived frugally in his Family, retrenching all needleſs as well as ſinful Expences, that he might have it in his Power to be thus beneficent. He was not like many Chriſtians, in theſe Days, who can ſee their Brethren have Need, and ſhut up their Bowels of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion; neither was he charitable in Word and Tongue only, but in Deed and in Truth. If he ſaw a Brother or Siſter naked, or deſtitute of daily Food, he did not content himſelf with ſaying unto them, Be ye warmed, be ye filled; but as far as his Ability would reach, gave them thoſe Things which are needful for the Body.</p>
            <p>And he was, no doubt, prompted hereto from a truly <hi>bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent Heart.</hi> Had he ſounded a Trumpet before him, when he did his Alms, that he might have Glory of Men; had he opened his Hand to relieve the Poor, not from a Principle of real Love to his Neighbour, but to ſerve his own Ends;—it would not have been declared to him from Heaven, <hi>that his Alms were come up for a Memorial before God.</hi> The merciful GOD accepted his Charities to the Poor: We may therefore be ſure they Proceeded from a truly charitable Mind. He was not one of thoſe hard-hearted Men, who could not be touched with a Fellow-Feeling of his Neighbour's Miſeries; he was not one of thoſe ſordid Creatures, who imagine all is loſt that is not laid out upon themſelves; but he had a hearty Good-Will to Mankind, thoſe of them eſpecially who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped the true GOD in Sincerity; and was ever diſpoſed to all the Exerciſes of Kindneſs towards them. He was ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hearted and compaſſionate; apt to ſhew Favour, ready to all the Offices of Humanity. In a Word, he was eminent for his benevolent Spirit and Conduct; one of thoſe good Men for whom one would even dare to die.</p>
            <p>And he was a <hi>juſt Man,</hi> (<hi>v.</hi> 22.) as well as charitable. What he gave away in Alms to the Poor was his <hi>own,</hi> not
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005556_0016_1018674907A609D0"/>
the Property of his <hi>Creditors.</hi> He did not defraud one Man that he might exerciſe Charity towards another; much leſs did he think of atoning for his Injuſtice by being bountiful to the Neceſſitous. Neither did he heap up Riches, and not by right. He would not ſteal, nor cheat; he would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, nor over-reach; he would not impoſe on the Ignorance of his Brother, nor make an unreaſonable Advantage of his Neceſſity; he would not be unfaithful to a Truſt repoſed in him; he would not neglect the Payment of his Debts, nor <hi>violate</hi> his Promiſe; he would not keep back the Wages of the Poor, nor defer the Hire of the Labourer to his Damage. He was, in ſhort, a downright honeſt Man. A Vein of Fairneſs and Equity run thro' all his Dealings with Mankind. He ever made that Law of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> as well as of Chriſtianity, the Rule of his Conduct, <hi>All Things whatſoever ye would that Men ſhould do unto you, do ye even ſo to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> adds, in this ſame 22d v. that he was a Man of <hi>good Report among all the Nation of the Jews;</hi> of a fair Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, highly eſteemed among his Neighbours, commonly reported to be a Man of an excellent Spirit. His Behaviour had been ſo blameleſs and inoffenſive, ſo expreſſive of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence towards GOD, and Benignity and Righteouſneſs towards Men, that he had a <hi>good Name</hi> among the <hi>whole Nation of the Jews;</hi> they all ſpake well of him. The true Fearers of GOD embraced him as a <hi>pious holy</hi> Man, and admired the divine Grace appearing in him. And, 'tis probable, thoſe who had no Religion themſelves ſaw ſo much of GOD in his devout, humble, charitable, and univerſally exemplary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, that they venerated his Perſon, and treated him with all decent Reſpect.</p>
            <p>Let us now take Occaſion, from this Part of CORNELIUS'S Character, to reflect upon our own. And may we not ſee our ſelves reproved and condemned by his Example? May it not be ſaid of too many of us, that, inſtead of <hi>giving much
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005556_0017_101867500F576228"/>
Alms to the Poor,</hi> we have given ſcarce any at all? O how deaf have we been to their Cry! How often have we ſhut up the Bowels of our Compaſſion! How little have we done for their Relief under Difficulties and Neceſſities! Have we not laid out <hi>that</hi> to pamper our Luſts, or adorn our Bodies, which might have better been beſtowed to feed the Hungry, and cloath the Naked?—And are there none of us, who have added <hi>Injuſtice</hi> to Uncharitableneſs? Can we lay our Hands upon our Hearts, and ſay, that we have all along, in the Courſe of Life, been fair and honeſt in our Dealings? Have we never oppreſſed the Poor and Fatherleſs? Have we never wronged our Neighbour? Have we carefully kept our ſelves from every Method of Fraud and Deceit, in our Trade and Traffick? Are there no Acts of Cozenage, no Inſtances of Cheating and Over-reaching, that lie heavy upon our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences? Let us review our paſt Conduct. And wherein we may have failed of <hi>doing juſtly,</hi> or <hi>loving Mercy.</hi> let us humble our ſelves before GOD, and repent.</p>
            <p>And let us learn, from the <hi>Example</hi> of CORNELIUS, both to <hi>give Alms</hi> and <hi>do Juſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With him, let us <hi>give much Alms to the Poor.</hi> This is a great Duty, much inſiſted on in the <hi>Bible,</hi> and much is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant on it. Inquiry will be made at the great and final Judgment, what Diſtributions we have made to the Poor? What Charities we have beſtowed for the Relief of their Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities? And according to what then appears, you will be <hi>abſolved</hi> or <hi>condemned.</hi> If you have ſhewed no Mercy, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will you then find Mercy; but that will be your Doom, <hi>Depart from me, ye Curſed, into everlaſting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels. For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no Meat; I was thirſty, and ye gave me no Drink; I was a Stranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye clothed me not; ſick, and in Priſon, and ye viſited me not.—Inaſmuch as ye did it not to one of the leaſt of theſe, ye did it not to me.</hi> Whereas, on the other Hand, if you have remembred the Poor, and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005556_0018_1018675328404688"/>
open'd your Hearts and Hands for their Help and Comfort, that will be the happy Sentence pronounced on you, <hi>Come, ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you, from the Foundation of the World. For I was an hungred, and ye gave me Meat; I was thirſty, and ye gave me Drink; I was a a Stranger, and ye took me in; naked, and ye clothed me; I was ſick, and ye viſited me; I was in Priſon, and ye came unto me.—Inaſmuch as ye have done it unto one of the leaſt of theſe my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ye have done it unto me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do you believe, my <hi>Brethren,</hi> a coming Day of Judgment? Do you expect to ſee the <hi>Son of Man</hi> deſcending from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in great Glory, with his holy Angels, to call the World to an Account? Do you hope to be found of your Judge, at that Day, in Peace? <hi>To do good and communicate, forget not: For with ſuch Sacrifices God is well pleaſed.</hi> Be liberal in your Diſtributions to Uſes of Charity. And be not weary of well-doing, neither faint in your Minds; but, as you have Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, do Good to all Men, eſpecially unto them who are of the Houſhold of Faith: So will you be acquitted at the Bar of CHRIST, and received to the Rewards of Mercy in GOD's heavenly and eternal Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And let me perſwade you to <hi>do Juſtice</hi> as well as give Alms. This is equally a Matter of Neceſſity, as you would hope, upon good Grounds, to give up your Account another Day, with Joy and not with Grief. Don't look upon the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of <hi>Honeſty,</hi> as little better than <hi>Pagan Morality,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Refinements of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> Deceive not your ſelves. CHRIST is not a <hi>Miniſter of Unrighteouſneſs:</hi> And his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is ſo far from allowing its Profeſſors to <hi>deal falſely,</hi> that it enjoins the contrary under the Penalty of Damnation. 'Tis true, the <hi>meer outward Part</hi> of Honeſty, without an <hi>inward righteous Principle,</hi> is of no Value, <hi>religiouſly</hi> ſpeaking: Neither ought our <hi>Honeſty,</hi> or any other Virtue, to be plac'd in the

Room of CHRIST, and depended on, inſtead of him, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure for us the Favour of GOD, and Admiſſion into Heaven: But this don't at all weaken our Obligations to the Practice of Righteouſneſs. The Law of <hi>Honeſty</hi> is the Law of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity;</hi> and if we think of being <hi>religious</hi> without being <hi>honeſt,</hi> we only put a <hi>Cheat</hi> upon our <hi>ſelves.</hi> The righteous Lord loveth Righteouſneſs; and they only who do Righteouſneſs will be accepted of him: Neither will CHRIST ſave any but ſuch. <q>His Merits are no Refuge for <hi>religious Knaves;</hi> his Wounds no Sanctuary for <hi>ſpiritual Cheats, Extortioners</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſors:</hi> And for ſuch Perſons to ſhelter themſelves in our SAVIOUR'S Propitiation, is to prophane and deſecrate it.</q> The plain Truth is, <hi>diſhoneſt Dealing</hi> is a ſhameful Thing in thoſe who call themſelves Chriſtians; and whatever their Pretences, or Hopes are, while they go on in the Practice of it, the LORD JESUS CHRIST will not own them for his Diſciples at the great Day; but doom them to the Place of Weeping, and Wailing, and Gnaſhing of Teeth.</p>
            <p>III. But I muſt now go on to the laſt Article in COR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NELIUS'S Character, <hi>his Faith in</hi> CHRIST, and <hi>Profeſſion</hi> as <hi>his Diſciple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have hitherto conſidered him, not as a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> but an <hi>excellent good Man:</hi> For ſo he really was, before he ever heard of CHRIST, as come in the Fleſh. 'Tis probable, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as he was a <hi>Jewiſh Proſelyte,</hi> that he had heard of the <hi>Promiſe made to the Fathers,</hi> and believed it: But now that it was fulfilled, and CHRIST actually come, 'twas neceſſary that he ſhould <hi>believe</hi> in him as ſuch. And in order to this, he was directed by an <hi>Angel,</hi> ſent on Purpoſe from GOD, to go to <hi>Peter,</hi> one of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> of CHRIST: And it was from him, and under his Preaching, that he firſt heard of CHRIST, and was enabled by Faith to embrace him as the SAVIOUR, not of the <hi>Jews</hi> only, but of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo. The
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005556_0020_10186758B6714950"/>
firſt Sermon concerning CHRIST, CORNELIUS ever heard, we have recorded in this Chapter, from the 34th to the 43d v. And the <hi>Effect</hi> it had upon him, and thoſe that were with him, is recorded alſo in the following Verſe, <hi>While</hi> Peter <hi>yet ſpake theſe Words, the holy</hi> GHOST <hi>fell on all them which heard the Word.</hi> And that the <hi>holy</hi> GHOST ſo fell on them, <hi>i. e. Cornelius</hi> and <hi>Company,</hi> as to diſpoſe and enable them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive CHRIST by true <hi>Faith,</hi> we learn from the 15th Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter of the <hi>Acts;</hi> where the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> giving the other <hi>Apoſtles</hi> an Account of the <hi>Effect</hi> of this very Sermon upon CORNELIUS and the other <hi>Gentiles</hi> with him, ſays, v. 8, 9. <hi>God gave them the holy</hi> GHOST, <hi>purifying their Hearts by Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that CORNELIUS was a <hi>Believer</hi> in CHRIST: And, as ſuch, he took upon him the Badge of Diſcipleſhip; was <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in the Name of the Lord,</hi> as we read in the laſt <hi>Verſe</hi> of the <hi>Chapter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How he behaved himſelf in his <hi>chriſtian</hi> Capacity, we are not particularly told; but he, no doubt, continued ſtedfaſtly in the Doctrine of CHRIST, and made Improvements in Grace and Holineſs, in Proportion to the greater Advantages he was now favoured with. We may reaſonably ſuppoſe, if he was a <hi>good Man,</hi> while only a <hi>Jewiſh Proſelyte,</hi> he was <hi>much more ſo</hi> now that he was a <hi>Believer in</hi> JESUS; having ſeen and heard thoſe Things, which many Prophets and Kings have deſired to ſee and hear, but could not.</p>
            <p>And if <hi>Faith</hi> in CHRIST was a matter of Neceſſity in Reſpect of CORNELIUS, 'tis certainly ſo in Reſpect of us, who live where his Goſpel is preached, and the Evidences of it, as a Revelation from GOD, have been clearly ſet before us. We are the Perſons to whom our SAVIOUR ſpeaks, as it were, by Name, in thoſe Words, Mark 16. 16. <hi>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved: But he that believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi> And again, John 3. 18. <hi>He that believeth on him is not condemned; but he
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:005556_0021_1018675E1C096DE0"/>
that believeth not is condemned already, becauſe he hath not belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Name of the only begotten Son of God.</hi> And yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, v. 36. <hi>He that believeth on the Son hath everlaſting Life: And he that believeth not the Son, ſhall not ſee Life; but the Wrath of God abideth on him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Take Heed then,</hi> my Brethren, <hi>leſt there be in any of you an evil Heart of Unbelief in departing from the living God,</hi> and his <hi>only begotten Son</hi> JESUS CHRIST.—Don't ſatisfy your ſelves with any Religion without CHRIST, nor with any Thing in Religion to the Excluſion of him. Deceive not your ſelves: <hi>There is not Salvation in any other; for there is none other Name under Heaven given among Men, whereby you can be ſaved.—Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it as a faithful Saying,</hi> and account it <hi>worthy of all Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that</hi> CHRIST JESUS <hi>came into the World to ſave Sinners.</hi> And <hi>count all Things but Dung, that you may win</hi> CHRIST, <hi>and be found in him, not having your own Righteouſneſs, which is of the Law; but that which is thro' the Faith of</hi> CHRIST, <hi>the Righteouſneſs which is of</hi> GOD <hi>by Faith:</hi> Yet, ſee to it that your <hi>Faith</hi> has a due Influence both on your <hi>Hearts</hi> and <hi>Lives;</hi> that it be an inward, active, powerful Principle of holy Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; ſhewing it ſelf in all the genuine Exerciſes of Love to GOD, and the REDEEMER, and your <hi>Neighbour:</hi> So may you look for the Mercy of the LORD JESUS CHRIST to eternal Life.</p>
            <p>I have now done with my Text. But it remains, as I promiſed at firſt, to give you ſome Account of that excellent Servant of GOD, whoſe Death gave Occaſion to the preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>And I am inclin'd to this, not that I might flatter a dead Friend, but do Honour to that <hi>Grace of God, which was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding abundant towards him, in Faith and Love that is in</hi> CHRIST JESUS. Such conſpicuous Inſtances of high Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005556_0022_101867634B9FB540"/>
in the chriſtian Life are very uncommon. And GOD expects a juſt Notice ſhould be taken of them. It would be a Wrong to the World, Injuſtice to the Memory of the Dead, and a with-holding from GOD the Glory due to his rich Grace in JESUS CHRIST, to be ſilent, when ſo fair an Occaſion is offered publickly to recommend Religion. And I am the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſpoſed to this Service, as, in the preſent Caſe, I ſhall be under no Temptation to exceed the Truth, and none will ſuſpect I am govern'd by ſiniſter Views.</p>
            <p>The Perſon whoſe Death we are lamenting, ſeems ſo like to the <hi>Scripture</hi> CORNELIUS, that, I doubt not, your Thoughts were upon him, while I was opening the Character in the Text: Nor was he at all inferiour to him, either as a <hi>devout Man; fearing God with all Houſe, and praying to God always:</hi> Or as a <hi>charitable Man; giving much Alms,</hi> conſidering his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, <hi>to the Poor:</hi> Or as a <hi>juſt Man, and of good Report among all the People</hi> by whom he was known: Or as a ſound <hi>Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in</hi> JESUS CHRIST.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not confine my ſelf to the Method of my Text in giving his Character; but chuſe to ſpeak of the Things that were exemplary in him, as they may come to Mind: And I ſhall ſay nothing but what I came to the Knowledge of, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <hi>perſonal</hi> Acquaintance and Converſation with him, or have ſeen under his own Hand in Papers that he has left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him.</p>
            <p>It was when between <hi>fifteen</hi> and <hi>ſixteen</hi> Years of Age, that he had awakened in him a ſerious Concern about his Soul, and everlaſting Salvation. His Sins were now ſet in Order before him, and his Soul filled with Diſtreſs, from the View he had of himſelf as expoſed to the Curſe of the Law, and the Wrath of GOD. And he made a good Uſe of his Convictions;
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:005556_0023_10186764F907A3D0"/>
was enabled, under the Influence of them, to break off from his Sins, and vain Companions, and betake himſelf to a ſerious and diligent Attendance on the <hi>appointed</hi> Means of Converſion; eſpecially <hi>ſecret Prayer:</hi> In which he was moſt earneſt and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate with GOD to take Pity upon ſuch a poor miſerable Sinner. I find him writing upon this Head in the following Words. <q>Never did any Perſon more earneſtly ſeek for Food for their Bodies to nouriſh and ſtrengthen them, than I did for Opportunies to pour out my Soul before GOD, in humble and importunate Prayer for Grace and Mercy. This was my conſtant and daily Work, not only on fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and fixed Seaſons for ſolemn Prayer; but by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant keeping my Heart with GOD, and by earneſt <hi>ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory</hi> Prayer, pouring out my humble and fervent Petitions to the GOD of all Grace, that he would be pleaſed, in his infinite Mercy, to have Compaſſion on my miſerable Soul, and not ſuffer me to periſh under his Wrath forever.</q> And he was particular in his Care, not to ſtifle his Convictions, but lay himſelf ſtill more open to them, that he might know the Worſt of himſelf, and the All-ſufficiency of CHRIST, and be enabled to repair to him as the <hi>alone</hi> SAVIOUR, in the <hi>Goſpel-Way.</hi> 
               <q>I humbly bleſs GOD, ſays he, that he did not ſuffer me to take any Methods, or uſe any Means, to ſtifle the Convictions of the bleſſed SPIRIT, and ſo recover my carnal Eaſe and Reſt; but that I was influenced to do all that lay in my Power to cheriſh theſe Convictions, and to lay my Soul open yet further to them, by earneſtly begging of GOD, that he would be pleaſed to make me yet more and more ſenſible of my dreadful Eſtate, and ſhew me the Worſt of my ſelf, and the abſolute Need I ſtood in of the LORD JESUS CHRIST; and that he would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover him to my Soul, as a moſt ſutable and all-ſufficient SAVIOUR for ſuch a miſerable undone Sinner as I am, and perſwade and enable me to receive him by a true and living
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:005556_0024_10186766B24650C8"/>
Faith, and heartily accept of him in all the Offices he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with, as the Mediator and Saviour of his People; as a <hi>Prophet</hi> to inſtruct me in the whole Will of GOD; as a <hi>Prieſt</hi> to atone for my Sins, and procure a perfect Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs for my Juſtification before GOD; and as a <hi>King</hi> to rule and govern me, mortify my Luſts, and ſubdue all my ſpiritual Enemies.</q> And he went on humbly and diligently waiting upon GOD, in the Ways of his own Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 'till he was enabled to receive the LORD JESUS CHRIST, with a Faith diſpoſing him to commit the whole Affair of his Salvation into his Hands, truſting in him and him alone for Righteouſneſs and Strength; with a Faith that purified his Heart, and ſhew'd it ſelf by Works, in a uniform ſteady Courſe of Obedience to the Goſpel, thro' the After-Courſe of his Life.</p>
            <p>He was but a very young Man, when he came into <hi>Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with this Church;</hi> and he did it, after great Exerciſe of Mind, and upon full Conviction of his Duty in this Regard. His Words are; <q>I was, at this Time, impreſt with a very great Concern of Soul as to my Duty in coming to the <hi>Lord's Table,</hi> and exerciſed with very great Fears about my <hi>Qualifications</hi> to come to that <hi>holy Ordinance;</hi> but a Senſe of Duty was ſo ſtrong upon my Heart, that I could not, I dared not, neglect, or delay any longer; conſidering that poſitive Command of my dear and bleſſed SAVIOUR, <hi>This do in Remembrance of me:</hi> And ſo I ſoon complied with my Duty in this Regard, and gave up my Self to GOD wholly and forever.</q> And he was religiouſly ſtrict in his Attendance on this, and all the other Duties of <hi>Piety,</hi> whether <hi>public,</hi> or <hi>private,</hi> or <hi>ſecret:</hi> Nor did he content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with this, but made it his Endeavour, depending on the divine Strength, to do the whole Will of GOD, by living <hi>ſoberly</hi> and <hi>righteouſly,</hi> as well as <hi>godlily.</hi> He made Conſcience
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:005556_0025_10186768928DB9B0"/>
indeed of his <hi>Words,</hi> yea, his <hi>Thoughts,</hi> as well as Actions. And it was the Labour of his Life to behave like a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> in every Relation he ſuſtained, to approve himſelf a good Huſband, a good Father, a good Neighbour, a good Friend, a good Member both of Church and Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>And he was particularly concern'd about his <hi>inward</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Springs of Action; not ſatisfying himſelf with the <hi>external</hi> Performance of Duty, but realiſing the Neceſſity of right Aims and Views, and that the Heart be right with GOD. And ſuch had been his Care upon this Head, as that he was able to write in theſe Words; <q>I have long ago found by happy Experience, that now I perform the Duties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion from quite other Principles and Diſpoſitions, and from other Ends, than I formerly did. Now it is with a View to GOD: And the pleaſing and glorifying him, I can ſincerely ſay, is the great End I aim at, in all the Duties I perform. I can truly ſay, and therein approve my ſelf to GOD <hi>who ſearches my Heart,</hi> that to pleaſe and glorify him is the very Top of my Ambition and Deſire. I humbly bleſs GOD I can ſay, I do love him with all my Heart and Soul, and Strength and Mind; and that I love him for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, on account of the infinitely amiable Perfections of his Nature, ſuch as his Holineſs and Juſtice, his Goodneſs and Mercy; and that it is my deſire and endeavour to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to him, in theſe and all other his communicable Perfections, in the higheſt Meaſure I am capable of. I can truly ſay, I love the Law of GOD for this Reaſon, becauſe it is holy; that I delight in it after the inward Man, and deſire nothing more than to be conform'd to it in the Frame and Temper of my Mind.—I hate all Sin for this Reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it a Tranſgreſſion of GOD'S holy Law; and I deſire that all Sin may be rooted out of my Heart.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:005556_0026_1018676E23131488"/>
And he was careful, not only that his Aims and Principles might be good, but that he might alſo place his <hi>Dependance right;</hi> not on <hi>his own Works of Righteouneſs,</hi> but the <hi>Merits of the</hi> LORD JESUS CHRIST. Accordingly, tho' he made it the <hi>grand Buſineſs of his Life,</hi> to walk before GOD in all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments and Ordinances blameleſs, yet he was thoro'ly ſenſible what a poor, frail, imperfect Man he was; that <hi>all his Righteouſneſs</hi> was but as <hi>filthy Rags,</hi> and that he could have Hope no where but in the Mercy of GOD, and <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of CHRIST. Hear his Language upon this Head. <q>Notwithſtanding, ſays he, the Experience I have had of GOD'S gracious Workings on my Heart, and a ſteady con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Practice of the Duties of Religion from my Youth up, I bleſs GOD, he has, by his holy SPIRIT, effectually ſhown me in the cleareſt and moſt convincing Light, the Imperfection of my Graces and Duties, and that they muſt all be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced in Point of Juſtification, and that I muſt be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied freely by the Grace of GOD, thro' the Redemption that is in the LORD JESUS CHRIST. And I truſt, GOD has bro't me off from any Dependance on <hi>theſe,</hi> and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled me to receive CHRIST, and depend upon <hi>his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs alone</hi> for Salvation: And my hearty Deſire is to be found in CHRIST, not having on my own Righteouſneſs, which is of the Law; but that Righteouſneſs which is thro' the Faith of CHRIST, the Righteouſneſs of GOD by Faith.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But there are ſome obſervable Things in the Life of this good Man, which muſt not be paſſed over without ſpecial Notice.</p>
            <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> is, The Chriſtian Temper of Mind, and noble Reſolutions, with which he went out into the World when he came of Age. I ſhall give you what I have to ſay here in his own Words. Says he, <q>When I arrived at Age, and came into the World to act for my ſelf, I bleſs GOD that by his
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:005556_0027_10186774865E91C8"/>
Grace, I can ſay, I came into it with this Diſpoſition and Reſolution, to make the Glory of GOD, and in Conjunction therewith, and Subordination thereto, the Salvation of my precious Soul, my great and principal Care; that I would, by the Help of Grace, make this World, and all the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs and Concerns of it, ſtoop and be ſubordinated thereto; that by a prudent Management of my <hi>particular</hi> Calling, I would make it ſubſervient to my <hi>general</hi> Calling; and that I would endeavour to follow the Advice of my bleſſed SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Seek firſt the Kingdom of God and his Righteouſneſs,</hi> and to rely on his Promiſe for the <hi>Addition of other Things,</hi> as he ſhould ſee them to be <hi>needful</hi> for me. Accordingly, I was bro't to conclude with my ſelf, that to be rich or great in this World was not neceſſary for me, but to be religious and holy was <hi>neceſſary,</hi> abſolutely ſo; and ſo I was brought to this Reſolution, to hearken to, and comply with, that Admonition of GOD, by his holy Prophet, <hi>Seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou great Things for thy ſelf? Seek them not.</hi> And to this it was owing, that I never involved my ſelf in the Buſineſs of this World, ſo as to make it become a Snare to my Soul; nor ſuffer'd any worldly Affairs to hinder me from waiting on GOD, either in the <hi>public,</hi> or <hi>private,</hi> or <hi>ſecret</hi> Duties of Religion.</q> How happy would it be, if our young Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would generally ſet out in the World, under the Influence of ſuch holy Diſpoſitions and Reſolutions! Making Religion their <hi>principal</hi> Buſineſs, and ſubordinating their temporal Affairs to the Concerns of their Souls and eternal Salvation.</p>
            <p>Another Thing I can't but eſteem exemplary in him, was the conſiderate religious Temper, with which he engaged in the weighty Affair of <hi>Matrimony.</hi> He writes thus upon it; <q>When I came to a Reſolution to alter my Condition, by entring into the married State, this I conſidered as a Matter of great Weight, and that it would be my making or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing in the World. And it put me upon moſt humble
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:005556_0028_1018677687C3E270"/>
and importunate Supplications to GOD, my heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for Guidance and Direction.</q> And he ſpeaks with Thankfulneſs, of being directed to one, <q>with whom he lived happily; and that they lived together as Heirs of the Grace of Life.</q> It would be well, if our young Men and Women would bear in Mind this good Example, and act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it. This of Marriage is one of the moſt momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Affairs of Life; and yet, tis too commonly engaged in with no more Conſideration, than if it was a very trivial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern.—It ought to be tho't upon in a ſerious Manner, and carried to GOD, by frequent and earneſt Prayer, as a Matter of the greateſt Importance; that which has a near Connection, not only with our <hi>temporal</hi> Happineſs or Miſery, but the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs or Miſery of our <hi>Souls</hi> in <hi>another World.</hi> If, in any Thing of a <hi>temporal</hi> Nature, you need the divine Guidance, 'tis in <hi>this:</hi> And you ſhould religiouſly acknowledge GOD, that he may direct your Steps. Thoſe Matches, in which GOD is not conſulted, are moſt likely to prove Curſes.</p>
            <p>Another Thing worthy of Remark in this good Man, is that <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Honeſty</hi> he ever made Conſcience of exerciſing, in the Courſe of his Trade and Buſineſs. He writes upon this Head in theſe Words; <q>I am able, with Comfort, to look back upon the Whole of my Concerns in the World, and can ſincerely ſay, I am not in the leaſt conſcious to my ſelf of any Fraud, or of deceiving any Man, in the Courſe of my Dealing with him. And, as for any Promiſes or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements that I might, at any Time, bring my ſelf under, it has been my conſciencious Care, at all Times, to fulfill them, in the exacteſt Time, and to the Satisfaction of every Perſon to whom I ſtood engaged; always believing and realiſing, that a Man cannot be a <hi>good Chriſtian</hi> without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>honeſt</hi> Man.</q> And he herein certainly judged right. In vain may any pretend to be the <hi>Diſciples</hi> of CHRIST, if they break their Promiſes, neglect the Payment
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:005556_0029_10186779A9F43FE8"/>
of their juſt Debts, and uſe the Methods of Fraud and Deceit in their Trade and Commerce. This deſerves our ſerious Conſideration in this Day of prevailing <hi>Diſhoneſty.</hi> For tho' it is not eno', that we <hi>deal juſtly;</hi> yet this muſt be one Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient in our Character, or we ſhall never inherit the Kingdom of GOD.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Family-Religion</hi> alſo is <hi>that</hi> in which he is worthy of Imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Says he, <q>
                  <hi>Joſhua'</hi>s Reſolution has been mine, <hi>As for me and my Houſe, we will ſerve the Lord.</hi> And it has been my conſtant and unfeigned Deſire and Endeavour to walk in my Houſe, with a perfect Heart; and to ſet the LORD always as preſent before me. And when it pleaſed GOD to increaſe my Family, by giving me Children, it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the great Concern of my Soul to be faithful to GOD and <hi>them,</hi> by inſtructing them, and bringing them up for GOD; and by ſetting an holy Example before them.</q> He has left, in Writing, a large Form of Inſtruction, by Way of Queſtion and Anſwer, of his own drawing up: And as it was the Form he ordinarily uſed in Inſtructing his Children, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it to Writing for their Benefit, not knowing but it might pleaſe GOD to take him away, while ſome of them were young: And 'tis done with good Judgment, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers conſiderable of Knowledge in Religion. His Children, 'tis to be hoped, will <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>, and make a wiſe and and good Uſe of it.</p>
            <p>He was likewiſe <hi>eminently</hi> a <hi>Man of Prayer.</hi> Few, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, were ever more conſtant in an Attendance on this Duty, or made it more their Buſineſs. I have heard him ſay, <q>that Prayer to GOD had been his <hi>daily</hi> Employment, the Work and Buſineſs of his Life, from the Days of his Youth.</q> And in his Papers I find him ſaying, <q>That, for the Space of <hi>Forty Years,</hi> hardly ever twenty-four Hours had rolled o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Head, but, at leaſt, <hi>two Hours</hi> of it had been ſpent
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:005556_0030_1018677D49AA6550"/>
in ſerious ſervent Prayer to GOD, in <hi>Secret,</hi> in his <hi>Cloſet,</hi> and in his <hi>Family.</hi>
               </q> And he did not attend this Duty, as <hi>forced</hi> to it by his Conſcience, or as eſteeming it a Taſk; but it was a real Pleaſure to him, in this Way, to repair to his heavenly FATHER. I have heard him ſay, <q>Prayer was the Delight of his Soul:</q> Nor otherwiſe could he have been ſo abundant in it.</p>
            <p>In fine, His <hi>Charity</hi> is what deſerves an honourable Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <q>I humbly thank GOD, ſays he, that, by his Bleſſing on my poor Endeavours, and ſmall Buſineſs in the World, I have been enabled, not only to provide for my Family, and to live comfortably, but alſo to exerciſe my ſelf in <hi>Works of Charity,</hi> as my Ability and Opportunity have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; and that, I hope, from a ſincere Love to GOD and CHRIST, and out of Obedience to his bleſſed Will, and that I might honour the Lord with my Subſtance, and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy my Gratitude to him for his great Goodneſs to me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I would add here, I have had Occaſion to obſerve in him, ſince his Introduction into the <hi>Deacon'</hi>s Office, a peculiar Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for the Poor: And he always appeared to me, not only faithful and prudent in diſtributing the Charities put into his Hands for their Uſe, but conſciencious in doing the utmoſt himſelf to relieve them under their Neceſſities. And he took Pleaſure in miniſtring to their Help; and was ready, upon proper Occaſions, to provoke his Friends and Neighbours to Love and good Works. In theſe, as well as in all other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, he <hi>uſed the Office of a Deacon well,</hi> and <hi>purchaſed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a good Degree, and great Boldneſs in the Faith, which is in</hi> CHRIST JESUS.</p>
            <p>I have now acquainted you, in ſome Meaſure, with the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> of this good Man; his Love to CHRIST, and uniform, regular, humble and cloſe Walk, with him. And

what might be expected as the Fruit, but a good Hope to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards GOD; yea, a comfortable Aſſurance of his being inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in his Favour here, and of dwelling with him in Heaven hereafter? And this accordingly was the Effect. I was never acquainted with many, who enjoy'd ſuch a conſtant, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted Serenity of Soul, ariſing from <hi>the full Aſſurance of Hope.</hi> He ſpeaks upon this Article in theſe Words; <q>With the moſt profound Humility of Soul, and in the deepeſt Senſe of my own Unworthineſs, I would acknowledge and admire the free and ſovereign Grace of GOD towards me, in making me the Subject of ſo diſtinguiſhing a Favour, as to be able to ſay, with the holy and bleſſed Apoſtle <hi>Paul, I knew a Man in</hi> CHRIST <hi>above fourteen Years ago.</hi> And if it ſhould be enquired, how I came by this Aſſurance of my good Eſtate towards GOD? I anſwer, By the SPIRIT of GOD witneſſing to his own Work in my Soul, and not by any haſty ſudden Tranſport of Affection; tho' of this I have had conſiderable Experience in the Courſe of my Life. This Aſſurance, I bleſs GOD, is not like <hi>Jonah'</hi>s Gourd, which came up in a Night, and withered in a Night; but is the Effect of long waiting, and earneſt and diligent ſeeking. I can ſay, and I bleſs GOD that I can ſay it, that <hi>I have made a Work and Buſineſs of Religion for full forty Years.</hi> And I have now <hi>this for my Rejoicing, the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of my Conſcience, that in Simplicity and godly Sincerity, not by fleſhly Wiſdom, but by the Grace of</hi> GOD, <hi>I have had my Converſation in the World.</hi> And I humbly acknowledge, it is <hi>by the Grace of</hi> GOD <hi>that I am what I am:</hi> And <hi>his Grace beſtowed on me was not in vain: But I laboured</hi> in Religion; <hi>yet, not I, but the Grace of</hi> GOD <hi>that was with me.</hi> And I moſt humbly <hi>give Thanks to</hi> GOD <hi>the Father, who hath made me meet to be a Partaker of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light.</hi>
               </q> There is another Paſſage in his Papers, from whence you may collect, how he came to ſuch a ſettled Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his Intereſt in the Mercy of the Lord JESUS CHRIST
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:005556_0032_10186784EB0784A8"/>
to eternal Life: And I the rather take this Opportunity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it to you, becauſe it diſcovers ſo clear and ſound a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the true <hi>Scripture</hi> Way of arriving at <hi>Aſſurance.</hi> It is this; <q>
                  <hi>Sanctification</hi> is certainly the beſt and moſt certain <hi>Evidence</hi> of our being <hi>pardoned</hi> and <hi>juſtified,</hi> let Men boaſt and brag of their ſtrong Faith in the Merits and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of CHRIST, and that they are juſtified thereby, while they have no Regard to <hi>inherent Grace</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> as the <hi>Evidence</hi> hereof. This is bold Preſumption; and plainly ſhews, that they have no true Knowledge and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of that <hi>Scriptural</hi> Aſſurance, which does and will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford true, ſolid, and laſting Joy and Comfort. In order to be ſatisfied in this great Goſpel Priviledge, that the bleſſed GOD has <hi>pardoned</hi> and <hi>juſtified</hi> me, by imputing the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Righteouſneſs of his SON, the Lord JESUS CHRIST, to my Soul; would I aſcend up to Heaven, to ſearch into GOD'S ſecret Counſels? No, I would rather deſcend into my own Heart, and make this ſerious and ſolemn Inquiry, whether the holy SPIRIT of GOD has come and taken Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of me, and ſet up his Kingdom of Grace in me, ſubdued my Luſts, and deſtroyed the Dominion of Sin and Satan in me, and enabled me heartily to embrace the Lord JESUS CHRIST, ſubmitting my Soul and Conſcience to his Rule and Government? What better <hi>Evidence</hi> can I have, that I am a Child of GOD, than to find that he has wro't the Temper of a Child in me? How can I know that GOD loves me, but by finding the Love of GOD rooted in my Heart? How can I come to know that I have a ſure Title to Heaven, and that I ſhall certainly enter into Heaven when I leave this World, but by finding that I live in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and converſe with ſpiritual and heavenly Things, now while I am living here on the Earth?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you ſee, how this good Man came by his <hi>Hope</hi> of Heaven. And it was always (from the Time of my Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:005556_0033_10186787EEEB3330"/>
with him) the ſame ſteady firm Perſuaſion, without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering or Interruption: And ſo it continued, thro' the whole of his lingering Sickneſs. I never perceived in him the leaſt Uneaſineſs, thro' Fear of Death; but often had Occaſion to take Notice of his calm and placid State of Mind, his Willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to die, and ſtrong Faith that he ſhould <hi>die in</hi> CHRIST, and go to be with CHRIST, in his heavenly FATHER'S King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. So far as fell within my Obſervation, he was a Stranger, both in <hi>Health</hi> and <hi>Sickneſs,</hi> to a <hi>rapturous Kind of Joy;</hi> but he was favoured with that, which, in my Opinion, was much more deſireable, a manly, ſolid, ſtable Satisfaction of Soul, ever accompanied with a becoming Seriouſneſs and Solemnity of Spirit. The greateſt Emotion I ever ſaw in him was a few Days before our laſt <hi>Sacrament,</hi> when, looking upon me with a pleaſant, yet ſerious Countenance, he ſaid with ſome Degree of Warmth, <q>I ſhould eſteem it a great Favour, if GOD would pleaſe to call me hence before the next <hi>Sabbath,</hi> that, while you, and the Church I belong to, are celebrating the <hi>Memorial of my dying</hi> SAVIOUR, <hi>at his Supper</hi> on Earth, I may be ſitting down at the <hi>Supper of the Lamb in</hi> GOD'<hi>s heavenly Kingdom:</hi> Nevertheleſs, not as I will, FATHER, but as thou wilt.</q> He would often ſay, <q>I bleſs GOD, I can with Appropriation call GOD MY FATHER, and JESUS CHRIST MY SAVIOUR.</q> He would often ſay, <q>
                  <hi>I know whom I have believed, and I am perſwaded, that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him againſt that Day.</hi>
               </q> He would often ſay, <q>I know GOD has wro't <hi>his own Work</hi> in my Soul; and <hi>I am confident of this very Thing, that he which hath begun a good Work in me, will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it unto the Day of</hi> CHRIST.</q> He would ſometimes ſay, <q>GOD is with me, and he will be with me; he has prepared me for himſelf, and he will take me to himſelf</q> I have heard him ſay, <q>He had not the leaſt Doubt of his going to Heaven when he died; <hi>For</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>God has made me meet for the heavenly Inheritance.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:005556_0034_10186789738043E0"/>
I would not ſuggeſt by all this, as tho' he was free from Infirmities and Faults. In this Senſe, <hi>there is none that doth Good, no, not one.</hi> And he would often, in the Midſt of his ſtrongeſt Expreſſions of <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> ſpeak of himſelf as a poor, frail, imperfect, ſinful Man; and ſay, after all, '<hi>that</hi> I eſteem the fitteſt Prayer for me, GOD <hi>be merciful to me a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:</hi> But then, he once added what I can't but think worth mentioning, <q>So long, ſays he, as I know that my Heart is right with GOD, and that he has form'd <hi>his own bleſſed Image</hi> in me, the <hi>Remains of Sin</hi> don't at all weaken my <hi>Hope.</hi> I deſire, indeed, to be humble under a Senſe hereof, and to mourn for my Infirmities and Sins; but they ſhall not make me part with my <hi>Hope.</hi> It was not the Deſign of CHRIST to make Believers <hi>perfect</hi> in this World. Perfect Freedom from Sin, and Perfection in Holineſs, are reſerved for Heaven: And I hope to enjoy theſe Bleſſings there.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In a Word, thro' his whole Confinement, 'twas more than a Recompence for a Viſit to him, to behold the Serenity of his Soul, the Strength of his Faith in GOD and CHRIST, his intire Contempt of the World, perfect Indifference to Life, and conſtant actual Willingneſs and Readineſs for Death. This indeed was very much his <hi>habitual</hi> Frame for a Courſe of Years before his Sickneſs: And it continued, yea, increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, in that <hi>trying</hi> Time. He was, all along, in his Sickneſs, in the <hi>lively</hi> Exerciſe of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope;</hi> and often expreſſed, even his Longings to be with CHRIST, which is beſt of all. The laſt Time I ſaw him was about three Hours before his Death; and he enjoy'd the ſame calm State of Mind, and expreſs'd the ſame <hi>Aſſurance of Hope,</hi> he had all along done. The only Difference was, his Strength ſo far failed, and Tongue faulter'd, that it was with Difficulty I was able to underſtand what he ſaid: Tho' I diſtinctly remember, the laſt Words I heard him utter were theſe, <hi>When you come to Heaven, you will find me there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:005556_0035_1018678B405167D8"/>
Under theſe Circumſtances, by Faith looking beyond the Grave to the Joys of his LORD, his <hi>Body fell aſleep,</hi> while his <hi>Spirit,</hi> I have no Doubt, was receiv'd <hi>to the Spirits of juſt Men made perfect:</hi> And when the <hi>Son of Man</hi> ſhall come, in the Clouds of Heaven, at the great and laſt Day, to <hi>awake thoſe who ſleep in the Duſt,</hi> He, among the <hi>Dead in</hi> CHRIST, ſhall riſe: And it will be to <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Immortality</hi> in GOD'S heavenly and everlaſting Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And can the ſurviving <hi>Relatives</hi> of ſuch a Servant of JESUS CHRIST be diſconſolate? Mourn you may; but let it be for <hi>your ſelves,</hi> not for <hi>him.</hi> For your Loſs is his Gain. He is now got above the Reach of Sin and Sorrow: He is now in the <hi>Paradiſe</hi> of GOD, in Company with holy Angels, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Spirits, yea, he is in the Preſence of JESUS the SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR, and of GOD <hi>the Judge of all.</hi> And would you wiſh him back again into this World of Miſery? As ye loved him, rejoice that he is gone to the FATHER: Rejoice in his Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, while you grieve that you ſhall no more have the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of his Company here on Earth.</p>
            <p>We unitedly bow the Knee to the GOD and FATHER of our LORD JESUS CHRIST; beſeeching him to be the <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'</hi>s GOD and <hi>Huſband.</hi> And may ſhe be quickened in her Preparations to follow after her departed <hi>Companion,</hi> that ſhe may again ſee his Face, and live with him in Glory.</p>
            <p>Nor can we wiſh any Thing better for the bereaved <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> than that their <hi>Father'</hi>s GOD would be their GOD, and give them a double Portion of that good Spirit which reſted on him. O remember the Inſtructions, the Counſels, the Warnings he has given you! They will riſe up in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt you, if you don't.—Let it be your ſollicitous Endeavour to ſupply his Place in the World, and be a like Bleſſing in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:005556_0036_1018678E854CF2E8"/>
And let us all duly reſent the Death of this <hi>Man of</hi> GOD. His Death is a Loſs, not only to his <hi>Family,</hi> but to the <hi>Town,</hi> and eſpecially <hi>this Church,</hi> and the <hi>Poor</hi> of it.—There are few ſuch Men left among us.—<hi>Help,</hi> LORD, <hi>for the godly Man ceaſeth; the Faithful fail from among us.</hi>—The LORD is thining our Glory.—Let us follow them who, thro' Faith and Patience, are gone to inherit the Promiſes.</p>
            <p>And may it pleaſe the good GOD, as he takes from us Men of Faith and Prayer, and an exemplary Converſation in CHRIST, to raiſe up others to ſupply their Place! And may there never be wanting, inſtead of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> the <hi>Children,</hi> to uphold the <hi>Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Ordinances</hi> of CHRIST in <hi>this Houſe.</hi> GOD grant it for his Mercies Sake, in his <hi>beloved Son</hi> JESUS.</p>
