            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>OBSERVATIONS ON OUR <hi>POLITICAL</hi> and <hi>COMMERCIAL</hi> connections with FRANCE.</head>
            <p>TO judge on theſe important ſubjects, we muſt conſider the peculiar ſituation of the United States, <hi>as connected with the European powers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AS a <hi>commercial</hi> country, it is our intereſt to form a friendly intercourſe with ſuch nations as are diſpoſed to promote the great objects of trade on the principles of <hi>reciprocity.</hi> To effect this purpoſe, we ſhould examine the <hi>conduct</hi> and <hi>diſpoſition</hi> of the ſeveral powers; and when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of their friendſhip, we ought to grant fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors, and confer privileges, with the ſame degree of liberality, as they appear inclined to act to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us. It is a good maxim in politics, <hi>to do to others, as they do towards us;</hi> and in order to prevent a continuance of injuries, it is incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on us to check them by a vigorous and timely <hi>retaliation.</hi> By purſuing a conſtant courſe of <hi>defenſive</hi> operations againſt ſuch nations as wantonly endeavor to diſtreſs our trade, we ſhall ſpeedily convince them of our increaſing ſtrength, and teach them the folly of commencing a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial war with us.</p>
            <p>THESE obſervations being premiſed, the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, what nation ſeems moſt diſpoſed to form connections with the United States, found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the broad baſis of mutual advantages?
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:026015_0003_0FCFDCFF877DFFD0"/>
What European power holds out the moſt favorable terms, to promote and enlarge our commerce? Which among them diſplays a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous cordiality towards our <hi>government</hi> and <hi>citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens;</hi> or by legiſlative acts, ſhows a diſpoſition to <hi>harmonize</hi> and <hi>equalize</hi> the trade and intercourſe of both countries? Can Americans be at a loſs to announce the nation, thus diſpoſed to overtures of friendſhip? Among the combined powers at war againſt France, can one among them, with propriety receive the appellation of friends, as to their proceedings towards us? Which among them has ever come forward with commercial propoſitions, worthy our acceptance? Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding we have ruſhed precipitately into the Britiſh trade, and inconſiderately laviſhed among her merchants and manufacturers, the principle part of every profitable branch of our commerce, yet we find that this nation, far from returning even decent <hi>attention</hi> to the numerous benefits they derive from the connection, treat us with the moſt <hi>ſtudied inſolence,</hi> and are ever planning meaſures to embarraſs us in every port we enter. Since their conteſt with France, have they not preſumed to prohibit our carrying the produce of America to that country, even as a <hi>neutral na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> Our veſſels and property are now become the ſport of their privateers; and the American flag, can ſcarcely be unfurled on the ocean with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being treated by them with indecency, and expoſed to inſults.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>coolneſs</hi> and <hi>indifference</hi> which many ſeem diſpoſed to ſhow towards France, are difficult to account for, as it reſpects both our political and
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:026015_0004_0FCFDD0184BE5B00"/>
commercial intereſt. As a young nation, is it not of the utmoſt importance, that we ſecure the <hi>friendſhip</hi> and <hi>confidence</hi> of France? That we do not create a <hi>jealouſy,</hi> and thereby excite her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment? If ſhe appears diſpoſed to aſſiſt us, and wiſhes to beſtow every commercial benefit upon us, ought we to treat her favors with cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or appear backward in acknowledging her benevolence and partiality?</p>
            <p>THERE appears a diſpoſition among <hi>ſome,</hi> to prefer a connection with Britain, rather than with France. It is evident that this is the aim and deſign of certain individuals, <hi>however they may wiſh to conceal it.</hi> But no man who is a friend to, or who underſtands the <hi>political</hi> and <hi>commercial</hi> welfare of theſe ſtates, can ſeriouſly deſire it. Should Britain ſucceed againſt France, can we ever expect to reap any advantage from the acquiſition? Should they reſtore the monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, is there any one benefit to accrue to us in conſequence of it? Will the American com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce thrive by the meaſure, or will there be leſs impoſitions practiſed on our trade? Will the Britiſh miniſtry be more cordial to our welfare? Will the legiſlature of the nation become more favorable in their plans; or will their acts be leſs injurious in their operation? In ſhort, not one advantage can we propoſe to ourſelves from their ſucceſs; but on the contrary, every misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune would await us. If the Britiſh are now ſo inſolent, amid their preſent complicated diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, what may we not expect, ſhould they effect their nefarious purpoſes of ſubjugating France? The idea is too diſtreſſing to anticipate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:026015_0005_0FCFDD02588ACA88"/>BUT let us reverſe the ſcene, and inquire, what may we not expect, ſhould France ſucceed? The friendſhip of this nation has ever been conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. During our war with Britain, we experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced the ſalutary effects of her favorable diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. Since the peace, her exertions have not ceaſed to aſſiſt our trade, and cement our alliance. There has ever appeared a noble generoſity in all their proceedings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to encourage the American connection; deſpiſing the paltry reſentments that appeared to influence the Britiſh nation, they have treated the Americans with a liberality worthy the character of a magnanimous people. Since their conteſt with the European powers, they have come forward with a philanthropy and independence that muſt aſtoniſh their enemies, and rivet the affections of their allies. They ſeem diſpoſed to give the United States all the advantages of the war; and for that purpoſe have paſſed decrees to grant the moſt ample en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to our commerce in every part of their dominions. They have placed us on the broadeſt baſis of <hi>neutrality, by admitting the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of all nations to be carried in American bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, free from capture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE importance of the French nation, in the ſcale of Europe, is a weighty conſideration, why we ought to inculcate an harmony with them. Many perſons talk of France, as they would ſpeak of Nootka-Sound, Botany-Bay, or the Miami Villages; as if it was a country <hi>juſt diſcovered,</hi> and of but little note in the political calendar. But it riſes in weight and dignity when it is conſidered, as one of the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:026015_0006_0FCFDD0D90E4B500"/>
moſt numerous, and moſt opulent nations in Europe. Its <hi>power</hi> is immenſe, when we reflect on the magnitude of their preſent conteſt. Is there a nation that could contend for ſo long a period with the combined powers of Europe? That could command ſuch reſources; maintain ſuch armies; equip ſuch navies, and defend themſelves without the <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> of a ſingle ally, againſt the combination of ſuch numerous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries?—When we conſider France thus <hi>ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alone,</hi> in this arduous and obſtinate conflict, the magnanimity, reſolution and formidableneſs of the nation, ſtand unparalleled.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>ſtrength</hi> of the nation is inconceivable, as it reſpects the <hi>number</hi> of its citizens.—Is it a ſmall matter for America to conciliate the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of twenty-ſix millions of people?—Shall we by our <hi>coldneſs</hi> and <hi>lukewarmneſs,</hi> hazard the advantages to be obtained from a nation ſo reſpectable, as to its population?—Is it <hi>policy</hi> in us to forfeit every benefit to be acquired from an alliance ſo reputable? Or ſhall we overlook eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry flattering conſideration merely to pay our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voirs to the tottering, crumbling nation of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain?—When we reflect on the probable advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages that will ariſe to our commerce, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of retaining the friendſhip of France, it muſt appear the higheſt folly not to cement our union. Should we by our puſillanimous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct excite their jealouſy, or forfeit their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they might be led to retaliate with ſome pointed reſentment on our conduct; and ſhould they purſue a ſimilar ſyſtem with Britain, we ſhould be placed in a very diſtreſſing ſituation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:026015_0007_0FCFDD0FED8E0C60"/>THE <hi>reſources</hi> of the French nation is another matter worthy of obſervation, and muſt impreſs every perſon with an exalted idea of its power and riches. Though they ſtand alone againſt the combined armies of Europe, they are enabled without any foreign loans, to raiſe funds ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for all other purpoſes.—Is it poſſible to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of a nation more reſpectable in this point of view?—Notwithſtanding their demands are ſo immediate and enormous, we find they are all anſwered with the utmoſt readineſs, and not a murmur is heard, either in the National Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, or among the people, of the burden of their taxes.—While the other powers are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſed for want of reſources<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> France abounds with every pecuniary ſupply, neceſſary for the moſt extenſive enterprizes. When we conſider the <hi>wealth</hi> of France, in compariſon with their enemies, how vaſtly ſuperior do they riſe in our eſtimation?</p>
            <p>IN ſhort, they have already bankrupted Europe; and as for England, they have ſhaken her to the centre, without even firing a gun within her territory, merely by the <hi>echo</hi> of their cannon from the ſhores of Holland.</p>
            <p>IT is deragatory to France, to draw any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon between them and England: Can the latter diſplay ſuch an army, or equip ſuch a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, upon any emergency; more particularly, had they to contend with one quarter of the force combined againſt the former? On the contrary, the propoſition of a loan, has ſpread ſuch an univerſal inſolvenſy, throughout the Britiſh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to throw a great part of her merchants
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:026015_0008_0FCFDD115BD6BD50"/>
and manufacturers within the ſtatute of bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptcy, and reduced her miniſter to the pitiful ſtate of an inſignificant pawn-broker.</p>
            <p>THESE are the ideas that ought to operate on the minds of Americans, when reflecting on our connection with France.—The puſillanimity we ſo often obſerve held up in our papers, may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the purpoſes of Britiſh ſycophants, and others, whoſe intereſt wholly depends on the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue ariſing from our <hi>deſtructive importations</hi> from England; but the people of America, who act and reaſon on the grand ſcale of public happineſs, cannot but view the friendſhip of France, as it concerns both our political and common intereſt, as an object of the higheſt magnitude.</p>
            <p>FROM the foregoing obſervations, it is not meant that we ſhould wantonly plunge ourſelves into a war with the Britiſh, or become a party in the preſent conteſt (unleſs <hi>France</hi> requeſts it) but thus much is meant and aſſerted, that <hi>our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Honor</hi> demands of us to ſupport our <hi>National Flag; protect the property of our citizens,</hi> and poſſeſs the FORTS within our own territory, which, by treaty we are entitled to—more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when it is conſidered, that the "<hi>ſtrong arm of the Union,</hi>" has been exerted to quell a few tribes of Indians, and more money has been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in theſe diſgraceful expeditions, than would <hi>build</hi> and <hi>equip</hi> a NAVY ſufficient to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect our commerce, and defend our flag againſt every indignity.</p>
            <p>IT is remarkable, that this ignominious Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an war, has ever been <hi>vindicated</hi> in thoſe papers
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:026015_0009_0FCFDD1334B028C0"/>

            <head>EXTRACTS FROM A SPEECH, MADE BY MAXIMILIEN ROBERTSPIERRE, IN THE NATIONAL CONVENTION, ON THE TENTH OF
<date>MAY, 1793</date>.</head>
            <p>MAN is born to enjoy happineſs and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet every where he is miſerable and enſlaved. Governments are inſtituted for the preſervation of his rights, and to perfection his faculties, yet every where governmenrs degrade and oppreſs him. The time is come which is to reſtore him to the ſtate he was intended for; the progreſs of information has prepared a great revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and to you it belongs to accelerate it. To fulfil your duty in this reſpect, you are to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice exactly the contrary of what has hitherto been done. Hitherto the art of governing has been the art of deſpoiling and enſlaving the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority, to the advantage of a few; and legiſlation the art of reducing thoſe crimes to a regular ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem. Kings, ariſtocrats have played their parts admirably well: to you it belongs now to do your duty, and to render men happy and free by the means of wholeſome laws.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:026015_0011_0FCFDD16094B3DF0"/>TO give to government energy ſufficient, that citizens may ever reſpect the right of their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-citizens, and to prevent government from encroaching on thoſe rights. This is my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, the double problem that legiſlators have to ſolve.</p>
            <p>THE firſt appears to me eaſy; the other one might be tempted to conſider as inſolvable, if a curſory view only is taken of preſent and paſt events, without examining their cauſe. Read hiſtory and you will every where ſee rulers op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing citizens; governments ſwallowing up ſovereignty. Tyrents ſpeaking of ſedition, the people complain of tyranny, when the people dare to complain, which is when exceſſive op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion reſtores their energy and independence. Would heaven, they could always preſerve theſe; but the reign of the people is of a day; that of tyrants ſtains the hiſtory of ages.</p>
            <p>I HAVE heard much ſaid of the anarchy ſince the revolution of July 14th, 1789, and eſpecially ſince that of the 10th of Auguſt, 1792.—But in my opinion it is not anarchy that is the malady of the political body, but deſpotiſm and ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy. I am of opinion, whatever may be ſaid to the contrary, that it is only from that apocha, which is ſo much abuſed, that we have had a beginning of laws and government, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſome diſturbances, which are nothing more than convulſions of expiring royalty, and the laſt ſtruggle of a faithleſs government againſt equality.</p>
            <p>POLITICAL evils never are occaſioned by the people, but are cauſed by the government.—
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:026015_0012_0FCFDD17AC806138"/>
How could it be otherwiſe? The people are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in the public good; the man in office has a private intereſt.</p>
            <p>IF I chooſe to ſtoop to anſwer abſurd preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, I would ſay, that power and opulence are the parents of vice; that poverty, mediocrity and induſtry, are the ſupporters of virtue; that the weak only aſk for the protection of mild laws; that the paſſions of the powerful tend to raiſe them above juſt laws, or to produce tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical laws.</p>
            <p>GOVERNMENT is inſtituted to cauſe the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral will to be obeyed; but men who govern, have a will of their own, and every will tends to make itſelf obeyed. If they employ to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the public force, with which they are armed, the government becomes a ſcourge. Agree then, that the firſt object of every conſtitution ought to be to defend public liberty againſt the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments of the government.</p>
            <p>IT is this principal object that legiſlators have forgotten—they have all ſtudied to give govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments energy; none of them thought of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it back to its original intention. They have taken infinite precautions againſt inſurrections of the people; but have at the ſame time encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged all in their power the revolt of their dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates. I have already given the reaſon of this. Ambition, violence and perfidy, have legiſlated for the world. They have even enſlaved human reaſon, by firſt debaſing it, and have rendered that reaſon, thus perverted, the inſtrument of man's miſery.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:026015_0013_0FCFDD1A226D33B0"/>DESPOTISM produced the corruption of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and the corruption of manners ſupported deſpotiſm. In this ſtate of things, the conteſt is, who ſhall ſell his ſoul to the ſtrongeſt, to lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize injuſtice and deify tyranny.</p>
            <p>OBSERVE even thoſe among legiſlators, whom the progreſs of political information appears to have impreſſed with ſome principles—obſerve whether they have not perverted their talents to elude them, when they claſhed with their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal intereſt. Obſerve whether they have done any thing more than vary the forms of deſpotiſm, and determine the nice ſhades of ariſtocracy. They have pompouſly proclaimed the ſovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the people, and have enſlaved them; at the time they acknowledged magiſtrates as the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the people, they have treated them as their maſters and idols. All have agreed in ſuppoſing the people mad and factious, and public functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaries abſolutely wiſe and virtuous. Without ſeeking for examples of this among foreign na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we can find ſome very ſtriking in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of our own revolution, and even in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the legiſlators, our predeceſſors.</p>
            <p>SEE with what baſeneſs they burnt the incenſe of adulation, at the altar of royalty; with what impudence they preached up confidence in the public functionaries, whom they knew to be perfidious; with what violence they defamed the people; with what barbarity they abuſed them. And yet ſee on which ſide the civic vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues weighed; the generous ſacrifices of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; the ſhameful averice of wealth; recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the heroic conduct of the private ſoldiers—
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:026015_0014_0FCFDD1B618A3E20"/>
the baſe treaſons of their officers; the invincible courage; the magnanimous patience of the people —the vile egotiſm; the odious perfidy, of ſo many of the public functionaries.</p>
            <p>BUT do not let us be ſurpriſed at the ſight of ſo much injuſtice, when we conſider the nation has juſt emerged from a ſtate of the deepeſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; how could a great portion of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives be expected to ſhew reſpect for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity; to love equality, and believe in virtue.</p>
            <p>UNFORTUNATE that we were! We were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to erect a temple to liberty, with hands yet galled with the chains of deſpotiſm. What was our former education, but a continual leſſon of ſelf-love and vanity? What were our cuſtoms, and what we called our laws, but a code of non-ſenſe and baſeneſs, in which men were claſſed in a whimſical gradation, and more or leſs deſpiſed, according to a multiplicity of fantaſtical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions?</p>
            <p>TO deſpiſe and be deſpiſed; to creep to the ſeat of power; ſlaves and tyrants by turns—one moment kneeling before a maſter, the next tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling under feet the people: ſuch was our fate; ſuch was our ambition, of almoſt all of us; whether well born, lawyers or financiers; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther councellors, or belonging to the army. Is it to be wondered at, that ſo many conceited merchants; ſo many vain cits held in ſovereign contempt the claſs of artiſans, when they in their turn were treated in the ſame manner by the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility? Oh what a noble pride! Oh! the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful education! And yet it is for this that the happineſs of the world is checked! For this
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:026015_0015_0FCFDD1CB24EEBE8"/>
the boſom of our country is torn by traitors! For this the ſavage ſatellites of the deſpots of Europe have deſtroyed our crops; burnt our cities; maſſacreed our women and children. The blood of 300 thouſand Frenchmen has been ſhed, and perhaps an equal number are yet to periſh; that the plain farmer ſhould not hold a ſeat in the ſenate with the rich dealer in grain; that the artiſan ſhould not have a vote in the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of the people, as well as the illuſtrious merchant or the preſuming lawyer; and that the poor, but intelligent and virtuous citizen be not allowed to appear as becomes a man in the preſence of the wealthy and profligate fool.</p>
            <p>INFATUATED men, you who cry out for maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that you may have no equals; do you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve then that the tyrants will agree to realize the dreams of your preſumptuous vanity and baſe cupidity? Do you believe that the people, after having conquered for liberty, and ſhed their blood in the defence of their country, when you repoſed in the arms of indulgence and luxury, or conſpired againſt them, will ſuffer you to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave them? No—if you reſpect neither huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, juſtice nor honor, at leaſt ſtudy your inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt as far as it reſpects your treaſures, which have no other enemy than the exceſs of human miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which you ſo imprudently aggravate.—But what reaſoning can weigh with proud ſlaves? The voice of truth thundering in a depraved heart, reſembles thoſe ſounds which are heard in funeral vaults without awakening the dead.</p>
            <p>YOU then, to whom liberty and your country is dear, undertake alone the taſk of ſaving the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:026015_0016_0FCFDD21D4855778"/>
public weal, and ſince the moment when its darkeſt dangers appear to call for your whole at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, is when an attempt is made to raiſe the edifice of the conſtitution with improper haſte, found it at leaſt upon the eternal baſis of truth. Eſtabliſh as a firſt principle, <hi>that the people are good; their delegates corruptible; that it is in the virtue and the ſovereignty of the people that a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative againſt the vices and deſpotiſm of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to be found.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FROM the principle I have endeavored to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh, let us now draw ſome conſequences uſeful in practice, which may form a ſolid baſis for a free conſtitution.</p>
            <p>THE corruption of governments flows from exceſs of powers, and their independence of the ſovereign: Find a remedy for this two-fold abuſe.</p>
            <p>FIRST leſſen the influence of magiſtrates.— Hitherto politicians, who have appeared to make ſome efforts, leſs to defend liberty, than modify tyranny, have only been able ro ſuggeſt two modes of effecting this—the balance of powers, and tribunes for the people.</p>
            <p>AS to the balance of powers, we may have been the dupes of that illuſion, at a time when faſhion appeared to require of us to give a mark of applauſe grateful to our neighbours, at a time when our own degradation left us to admire all foreign inſtitutions with any thing like a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of liberty to recommend them. But with little reflection, it is eaſy to perceive, that that balance muſt be either a chimera or a ſcourge; that it ſuppoſes the government a total nullity, did it not neceſſarily occaſion a league between
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:026015_0017_0FCFDD24177708C8"/>
the rival powers againſt the people; for it muſt eaſily be perceived, that they will rather agree among themſelves, than call in the ſovereign to judge in his own cauſe. Witneſs England, where the gold and power of the monarch al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways inclines the ſcale on one ſide, where the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition party appears to ſolicit a reform in the national repreſentation only to retard it, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert with the majority, which they ſeem combat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; a ſpecies of government monſtrous, where the ſocial virtues are only to be found in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; where the phantom of liberty excludes the reality; where law ſanctifies deſpotiſm, and the rights of the people are the objects of open traffic; where corruption is even diſengaged from the ſhackles of modeſty. And what are to us the contrivances that balance a tyrannic au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority! It is tyranny itſelf that muſt be extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated. It is not during the differences of their maſters only, that the people wiſh to breath a few moments; it is in their own ſtrength they ſhould repoſe for the ſecurity of their rights; for the ſame reaſon I am not in favor of tribunes; hiſtory has not taught me to reſpect them.</p>
            <p>I WILL truſt ſo great an intereſt (that of the people) with no one man—they are all weak and corruptible. Protection from tribunes, preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the people ſlaves. I do not like to ſee the Romen people retiring to the holy mount, and thence aſking for protectors from a deſpotic ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate or inſolent patricians; I wiſh them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in Rome, and thence to drive all tyrants. I hate as much as I hate thoſe patricians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and I deſpiſe much more, the ambitious
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:026015_0018_0FCFDD259F90DF20"/>
tribunes, thoſe vile proxies for the people, who ſell to the wealthy of Rome, their ſpeeches and their ſilence, and who only defended their rights now and then, better to bargain when they come to barter them for gold. There is but one tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune of the people that I can acknowledge—the people themſelves; it is to each ſection of the French Republic, that I wiſh to confide the power of tribune; and it will be eaſy to orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize them in ſuch a manner as to free them from the ſtorms of abſolute democracy, and the perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious calm of repreſentative deſpotiſm. But before we think of placing barriers to protect ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil liberty againſt the overflowings of the power of magiſtrates, let us firſt define the juſt limits of that power.</p>
            <p>A FIRST rule to attain this end is, to fix ſhort periods from one election to another, applying this principle in an inverſe ratio to the quantum of power entruſted.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. ESTABLISH, that no one ſhall hold more offices than one at the ſame time.</p>
            <p n="3">3d. THAT the powers be divided. It is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to multiply public officers, than truſt to a few, a formidable power; let legiſlation and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be totally ſeparated.</p>
            <p>LET the various departments in the execution be entruſted to different hands, and to as many hands as the nature of the buſineſs will allow.</p>
            <p>ONE of the great faults of the preſent organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation is, the too great extent of each of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial departments, in which are collected va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious branches of adminiſtration very diſtinct in their nature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:026015_0019_0FCFDD28769AC280"/>PUBLIC opinion ought to be the guide of men in public life, and public men ſhould not attempt to guide or form public opinion.</p>
            <p>I SHALL be aſked, perhaps, how, with ſuch ſevere reſtraints upon public functionaries, I can ſecure obedience to the laws and government? I anſwer, that thereby I ſtrengthen that ſecurity; by thoſe very precautions I give to the laws and government the influence I take from the vices of men who govern and make laws.</p>
            <p>THE reſpect which a public functionary inſpires, depends much more upon the reſpect he ſhews for the laws, than on the power he uſurps—and the power of the laws lies much leſs in the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary force ready to enfore them, than on their agreeing with the principles of juſtice and the general will. When the law has for baſis the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the people, it will have the people for ſupport, and its energy will reſt upon the energy of the whole community, of which it is the work.</p>
            <p>THE general will and public force have the ſame origin; the public force is to the political body, what the arm is to the human body, exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting what the will commands, and repelling every thing that menaces the head and heart.</p>
            <p>WHEN the public force ſeconds the general will, the country is free and quiet; when they differ, the country is either enſlaved or its tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity diſturbed.</p>
            <p>THE public force contradicts the general will in two inſtances; either when the law is not an expreſſion of the general will, or when the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate employs it to violate the law. Such was the horrid anarchy that tyrants have ever eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:026015_0020_0FCFDD2AE161DA48"/>
under the name of tranquillity, good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, legiſlation and government. All their arts conſiſts in inſulating and oppreſſing each citizen with the public force; to render them all ſlaves to their caprice, which they dignify by the name of law. Legiſlators enact juſt laws—magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates cauſe them to be punctually executed, and you will give to the world a new ſpectacle, that of a great people, free and virtuous.</p>

            <p>THE age of reaſon and philoſophy has at length arrived, and begins to illuminate the world! While that veil of darkneſs, which ſpread itſelf over all nations, was faithfully preſerved by the <hi>pious</hi> alliance of CHURCH and ſtate, the earth wore a wretched aſpect, and humanity wept for the miſeries of man. But when en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened men began to examine the cauſe of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man wretchedneſs, and by their efforts had pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated the ſecret corruption of royal courts, the pillars of deſpotiſm were ſhaken to the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. King-craft and prieſt-craft, thoſe mighty enemies to reaſon and liberty, were ſtruck with death by the genius of 1776. For ſeventween years they have been decaying under the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a mortal wound, and now in the laſt ſtage of their exiſtence, like a drowning man catching at a ſtraw, one more deſperate effort is making to preſerve them from inevitable deſtruction. But they are ſummoned with a mighty voice to the dark abodes of oblivion, "to which I wiſh them a ſpeedy and unobſtructed paſſage," never more to raiſe again to ſcatter miſchief among de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded nations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:026015_0022_0FCFDD2DEE4EC450"/>IN this view of the ſubject, and conſidering the conſequences, it is impoſſible not to admire the manly firmneſs which dictated the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of American Independence. Thoſe bold patriots deſerve, and will undoubtedly obtain the thanks and applauſe of all poſterity. How much is it to be lamented, that any whoſe names we ſee affixed to that great inſtrument, ſhould at this day afford good ground of ſuſpicion, that their politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal principles are directed to the total deſtruction of LIBERTY and EQUALITY. But the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious of liberty is rouſing from ſlumber, and will eventually emancipate the world. Beware, ye American ariſtocrats! your principles and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts are leading you to a precipice, from which the juſt reſentment and indignation of an injured people will hurl you into eternal infamy. Civil and religious oppreſſion will not gain much ground in the American world, though attempts are making to effectuate both. If the cauſe of France, which is the great cauſe of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhould ſucceed, then farewell kings, ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crats, and the long catalogue of clerical impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—impoſitions which have robbed man of his greateſt dignity, and cloſed every avenue of independent reflection. Indeed, had it not been that the clergy gained a complete aſcendency over the minds of men, the civil oppreſſions of the world would long ſince have tumbled into ruin. But living on the ſpoils of the people, it was eaſy for theſe impoſtors to preach up the beauty and excellency of humiliating poverty, that they themſelves might riot upon the luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the earth. And thus while they degraded
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:026015_0023_0FCFDD2FB5C9F178"/>
the human character and feaſted on the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous profits, they aided the already too potent arm of the civil tyrant, and prepared every living creature for the completeſt ſlavery.</p>
            <p>HOW lamentable is it, that religion, which ought to unite all hearts, ſhould ſo often be made uſe of as a cloak for the commiſſion of the greateſt crimes, and by thoſe very men too, who have ſo often impoſed themſelves upon the world as perſons of ſuperior ſanctity and virtue. I do not mean to inſinuate in this place that there are not virtuous and upright individuals among this body of men; but, take them as a body, they have done infinite miſchief, and many of them merit the curſes of the preſent and all fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ages. In juſtice, however, to the American clergy, it ought to be obſerved, that in effecting our revolution, many of them by their precepts and example afforded great ſervice, and were truly valuable members of the community. I wiſh it could be ſaid at this day, that none of them aſſumed the myſterious carriage and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary dignity of an European biſhop.<note n="*" place="bottom">

proſpect. The empire of reaſon will ſoon ſweep from off the earth this bundle of nonſenſe and oppreſſion, and permanently fix the attention of the human mind upon a point eſſential to its dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and happineſs. Already have the two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions of America and France awakened in the intellectual world a new energy of thought, and turned the purſuit of man upon ſcientific principle into the path of liberal diſcuſſion. Previous to theſe great events—events unparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leled in the hiſtory of ages, every purſuit of man was tinctured with the deſpotiſm of <hi>church</hi> and <hi>ſtate.</hi> Scarcely a ſingle art or ſcience could be independently inveſtigated without fear and trembling; at leaſt it was firſt to be enquired how the proof of any propoſition would affect the power and influence of thoſe two <hi>holy</hi> ſiſters, who ſubjugated the earth in perpetual bondage. The rights, dignities, and eſſential privileges of the human race, were buried in the gulph of roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and clerical avarice and deception. But theſe days of fanaticiſm and oppreſſion are vaniſhing away, and the philoſophy of the human mind is making deep reſearches, to develope the nature of thoſe principles, which will afford a perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent hope to the wretched in every part of the world.</p>
            <p>THE cries of millions of innocent ſufferers are calling aloud upon reaſon and philoſophy to come forth to their aid, and lead them with a powerful hand to the land of light and joy. And it is a matter of unuſual conſolation, that the two great events, previouſly mentioned, have
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:026015_0025_0FCFDD33D9798BA0"/>
ſo far contributed to ſtimulate reflecting men to inveſtigate the principles of nature, as leads to a hope, that a laſting ſource of felicity may be eſtabliſhed for the great family of mankind. Not much longer ſhall ſuperſtitious impoſtors <hi>decimate</hi> the fruits of man's induſtry: but the principles of government, religion, literature, and morals, ſhall receive that candid and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial diſcuſſion, which the nature and importance of the ſeveral ſubjects require. Already great improvements have been made, and though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are in dread of innovations, yet I conceive no good ground of apprehenſion has been ſhewn on theſe ſubjects.</p>
            <p>THE philoſophy of this age, teaches the moſt pure and unadulterated morality; and ſtripping religion of its myſteries and external trappings, will preſent it to the view of the human mind in more beautiful and attractive charms: ſo that in every point of view, theſe great political events will ſerve to ameliorate the condition of the human race.</p>

            <head>ORATION, BY CITIZEN BRACKENRIDGE, On the Celebration of the Anniverſary of Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. [Pittſburgh,
<date>July 4, 1793.</date>]</head>
            <p>THE celebration of the day, introduces the idea of the principle that gave it birth: Was it the wiſdom of the king of Great-Britain, who ſaw the growing greatneſs of the province, that they were now of age to act for themſelves, and bade them be independent? No—The wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the parliament of Great-Britain, that ſeeing the inconvenience or impoſſibility of our being repreſented in the legiſlature, and ſenſible of the unreaſonableneſs of being bound by laws without being repreſented, ſaw the expediency of a ſeparation from them, and ſaid to us, Be independent and become an allied power? No— Nothing of all this. The king and parliament of Great-Britain, were of opinion, that without repreſentation, we were bound by their laws, and though deſcendants of their iſle, had no right to freedom in a great foreſt.</p>
            <p>WHENCE then our independence? It was the offspring of the underſtanding and the virtue of the people of America themſelves. The elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent adviſed; the brave fought, and we ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded. The day on which we aſſumed our rights, became a feſtival; and every future year ſhall remember it with ardent exertion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:026015_0027_0FCFDD3DDFDB7CB0"/>THE celebration of the day, introduces the idea of the effect of it beyond the ſphere of theſe ſtates. The light kindled here has been reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to France, and a new order of things has ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen. Shall we blame the intemperance of the exertions? Was there ever enthuſiaſm without intemperance? and was there ever a great effect without enthuſiaſm? Thy principles, O! Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, are not violent or cruel: but in the deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of thy efforts againſt tyranny, is it not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways poſſible to keep within the limit of the vengeance, neceſſary to defence? Do we accuſe the air, or the baſtile of the mountain, when the rock is burſt, and the town engulphed? The air of itſelf is mild, and ſcarcely wafts a feather from its place: But reſtrained and impriſoned, the yielding and placid element becomes indignant, and tears the globe before it. Do we accuſe the hurricane, when the mariner is toſſed with the tempeſt, and is an incidental ſufferer in the ſtorm? The naturaliſt does not. He tells you that the equilibrium of the atmoſphere has been diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and if man has ſuffered more than the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit of his tranſgreſſions it is in a ſtruggle of nature to reſtore herſelf.</p>
            <p>IS it the duty of theſe ſtates to aſſiſt France? That we are bound by treaty, and how far, I will not ſay; becauſe it is not neceſſary. We are bound by a higher principle, if our aſſiſtance could avail; the great law of humanity.</p>
            <p>WE might, it is true, alledge the ſtipulations of a treaty, and the <hi>guarantee of her poſſeſſions to France.</hi> But all the world would know, and we ought to avow it, that it is the cauſe of republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caniſm
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:026015_0028_0FCFDD3F22882DF0"/>
which would induce our efforts. The tyrant of Great-Britain alledged the ſtipulations of a treaty relative to the opening of the Schaldt and waiting for no requiſition on the part of Holland to obſerve the guarentee. But all the world knew, and he might have avowed it, that it was not the opening of the Scheldt, but the attack upon monarchy, that prompted his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. Shall kings combine, and ſhall repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics not unite? We have united. The heart of America feels the cauſe of France; ſhe takes a part in all her councils; approves her wiſdom; blames her exceſſes; ſhe is moved, impelled, elevated and depreſſed; with all the changes of her good and bad fortune; ſhe feels the ſame fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in her veins; ſhe is toſſed and ſhaken with all the variety of hopes and fears, attending her ſituation: Why not? Can we be indifferent? Is not our fate interlaced with hers? For, O France! if thy republic periſh, where is the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor due to ours? From whom reſpect to our flag upon the ſeas? Not from France reſtored to a monarch, and indignant at theſe very feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which are now our glory: Not from the deſpots that are againſt her: Theſe will eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect that the cauſe of their evils took their riſe here.</p>
            <p>CAN we aſſiſt France by arming in her favor? I will not ſay that we can. But could we, and ſhould France ſay, United States, your neutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is not ſufficient; we expect the junction of your arms with mine; your heroes on the ſoil, and your privateers on the ocean, to diſtreſs the foes; who is there would not ſay, It ſhall be ſo;
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:026015_0029_0FCFDD40A1EB3658"/>
you ſhall have them; our citizens ſhall arm; they ſhall attack; our oaks ſhall deſcend from the mountains; our veſſels be launched upon the ſtream, and the voice of our war, however weak, ſhall be heard with yours!</p>
            <p>IF we our ourſelves ſhould judge that our arms could aſſiſt France, even though the gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous republic required it not, yet who would he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate to interfere, not only at the riſk of proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but life itſelf? Is it illuſion; or do I hear France ſay? My daughter America! I know the dutifulneſs of thy heart towards me; and that thou art diſpoſed to ſhew it, by taking part in this war. But I wiſh thee not to provoke hoſtilities for my ſake. If I periſh, I periſh; but let not a mother draw in a hapleſs child, to ſuffer with herſelf: Is it illuſion; or do I hear America reply? I do, and it is in the language of the Moabiteſs Ruth, to her mother-in-law, the Jewiſh Naomi, "Intreat me not to leave thee, or return from following thee; for whither thou goeſt, I will go; and where thou lodgeſt, I will lodge; thy people ſhall be my people, and thy God my God; where thou dieſt, I will die, and there will I be buried. God do ſo to me, and more alſo, if aught but death ſhall part thee and me."</p>
            <p>BUT whether we aſſiſt or not, thy cauſe, O! France, will be triumphant. Did the enthuſiaſm of a ſmall Roman people, repel their invaders, until Rome became the protectreſs of nations? Did the enthuſiaſm of a few Greeks, repel the millions of Aſia, and afterwards overrun her kingdoms? Did the enthuſiaſm of the Saracens,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:026015_0030_0FCFDD4470E98BA0"/>
in a few years ſpread to Spain on the one hand, and the Indus on the other? Did the enthuſiaſm of a few mad Cruſaders, burſt upon the Saracen, and eſtabliſh the kingdom of Jeruſalem in the centre of his empire? And ſhall the enthuſiaſm of a brave people, more numerous than the early Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man republic, the Greeks under Alexander; the Saracens of Arabia, or the Cruſaders of Europe, be ſubdued by all that are againſt them? The weight will but condenſe reſiſtance, and as the materials of exploſion in the ordonance acquire a ſpring by confinement, ſo in proportion to the attack of this people, will their voice be terrible, their blow ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtable.</p>
            <p>FRANCE will be independent alſo, and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate her anniverſaries; and in doing ſo will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect that our independence had preceded hers and made the example.—The anniverſary of the independence of Amarica will be a great epocha of Liberty throughout the world. Proceed we then to celebrate the day; advance to the feſtive board; pour out liberations to ſentiments of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and let the loud mouthed artillery be heard on the hill!</p>
