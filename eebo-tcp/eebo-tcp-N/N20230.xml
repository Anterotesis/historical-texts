            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>CANDID READER,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT was with much reluctance, that the author of the following pages permitted them to be publiſhed; as he has ſtill entertained an aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to religious controverſies, which often are productive of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and animoſity: he has no am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition to be known as an author, as he has never made compoſition his ſtudy:—his ſole motive in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, is to vindicate the ways of God to man, whoſe moral govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has been groſsly miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, by many pious, well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning men, who have imbibed opinions and principles that are contrary to both ſcripture and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, while they were young, and have omitted to give them a candid and critical examination at a more mature age. Some, moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, are prevented by prejudice, from reading what has been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb facs="unknown:026523_0004_0FD0853B13297CB0"/>
by other denominations of chriſtians—and more by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant application to their reſpective profeſſions and callings: probably a ſhort tract, ſuch as the following, may be better ſuited to both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, than a more lengthy treatiſe; as curioſity may excite, even a <hi>bigot</hi> to read a few pages, who could not be prevailed upon to buy, or read a large volume: and if it be found to contain even a clue, that may lead to a further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation of important truths, and the detection of error—it will ſuit the man of buſineſs beſt; as it is only neceſſary to ſet the human mind in action, and furniſh it with a few ſelf-evident principles, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able it to proceed in the inveſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the benevolent deſigns of the Deity, in the creation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, which muſt have been to make them eternally happy, in glorifying and enjoying him; and if it be granted, that God created them for this end; he certainly has a ſufficient degree of wiſdom
<pb facs="unknown:026523_0005_0FD0855FD2E668D0"/>
and power to accompliſh his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and cannot be fruſtrated in the fulfilment of his gracious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>As the future ſalvation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind depends entirely on the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, wiſdom and power of God, they are in ſafe hands: his infinite benevolence inſpired him, to create them; his infinite wiſdom laid the plan for their redemption: and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite power muſt, and will accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh all that he has planned; although earth and hell ſhould ariſe in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition againſt him. How irrational, how unſcriptural is it to ſuppoſe, that God made any number of the human race, on purpoſe to make them eternally miſerable?</p>
            <p>Be candid, gentle reader; lay the prejudice of education aſide, and examine the evidences for, and againſt the doctrine of eternal, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ending puniſhment, with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom—the ſubject is certainly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and important, and claims your
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:026523_0006_0FD0853DB979AF20"/>
ſerious attention and diligent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry. The honor of God and the good of mankind, are involved in its diſcuſſion and deciſion. If it is of importance for us to love God, it is certainly neceſſary for us to know his true character; which is all glorious—when ſtript of the monſtrous imputations of cruelty, attributed to him, by too many men, who are influenced more by cuſtom and tradition, than by ſcripture and reaſon. It is a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy truth, that there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny abſurd doctrines, founded upon a partial knowledge, and erroneous conſtruction of the ſcriptures; this circumſtance alone ſhould induce us to examine for ourſelves, and not conſide, too far, in the aſſumed infallibility of any ſet, or ſect of men; and above all, ſhould we ſuſpect the tenets of thoſe, who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the Deity, acts of injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and cruelty, that would ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize and blacken the character of a Nero or an Herod! The doctrine of predeſtination, as taught by Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:026523_0007_0FD085615FC0B920"/>
is clearly of this kind: ſee his definition or predeſtination, in the 21ſt chapter of the third book of his inſtitution of the chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, 440th page, in the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; to wit, <q>Predeſtination we call the eternal decree of God, whereby he had it determined with himſelf, what he <hi>willed</hi> to become of every man: for all are not created to like eſtate; but ſome to eternal life, and ſome to eternal <hi>damnation,</hi> is fore-appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Therefore, as every man is created to the one or other end; ſo we ſay, that he is predeſtinate, either to life or death. Page 443, This council, as touching the elect, we ſay, is grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his free mercy, without any reſpect to the worthineſs of man; but whom he <hi>appointeth to damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> to them, by his juſt indeed, and irreprehenſible, but alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible judgment—the <hi>entry of life is blocked up.</hi> Now in the elect, we ſet vocation to be the teſtimony of election;
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:026523_0008_0FD0853ED32F8790"/>
and then juſtification to be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſign, on the manifeſt ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, till they come to glory, wherein is the fulfilling of it. But, as by vocation and election, God maketh his elect; ſo, by ſhutting out the <hi>reprobate,</hi> either from the knowledge of his name, or from the ſanctification of his Spirit, he doth, as it were, by theſe marks, open what judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment abideth for them:</q> which, according to his creed, is eternal, never ending <hi>damnation,</hi> without any regard either to his merit or deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. The Weſtminſter aſſembly of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, proceeding upon the ſame grounds, in their anſwer to the queſtion, "What are the decrees of God;" affirm, that he has fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained, whatſoever comes to paſs; ſo that every event that ever has, or ever will come to paſs, are all immutably eſtabliſhed, by a decree of the Deity, and conſequently are unavoidable by men; who are, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, to be puniſhed to the endleſs ages of eternity, for acting
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:026523_0009_0FD08562CE56AF50"/>
as the Deity had decreed they ſhould do; they being reduced to the ſhocking dilemma of acting, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contrary to the decrees or commands of their maker. When we contemplate this doctrine of the decrees, and compare <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> with their opinion of the fall of Adam, and its fatal conſequences, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his poſterity, who are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have loſt communion with God, to be under his wrath and curſe, made liable to all the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of this life, to death <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, and to the pains of hell forever—it ſhould admoniſh us to embrace the opinions of the beſt of men, with caution, and to make uſe of our own reaſon, in examining the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, on every important ſubject. The Deity has been pleaſed to make his attributes known to us; therefore, whatever conduct may be aſcribed to the Deity, that is incompatible with the perfections of theſe glorious attributes, muſt be a groundleſs and falſe imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, tending to injure the moral
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:026523_0010_0FD085404E2287C0"/>
character of the ſupreme ruler of the univerſe, and ſhould be reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. If we proceed agreeably to this rule, can we poſſibly believe, with Calvin, "That infants bring their <hi>damnation</hi> out of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's <hi>bellies</hi>?" And many others; who have taken Calvin for their ſpiritual guide, affirm, that there are millions of infants now in hell, who died before they were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of diſtinguiſhing between good and evil, there to be puniſhed to the endleſs ages <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> eternity: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as they affirm, theſe infants were born ſinners, and had never repented for Adam's tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and the corruption of their own natures—which they term original ſin; which they aſſert, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them juſtly liable to the wrath and curſe of God, both in this life, and that which is to come. This certainly cannot be the doctrine of the benevolent Jeſus, who ſaid, "Suffer little children to come unto me, for of ſuch is the kingdom of heaven." And again, except ye
<pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:026523_0011_0FD085655B21C530"/>
be converted, and become as little children, ye ſhall in no wiſe enter into the kingdom of heaven. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if little children were in ſuch a corrupt and damnable ſtate, as Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin and his followers have repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented them to be, Chriſt, who was, undoubtedly, a very competent judge, would never have ſet them up, as fit <hi>patterns</hi> and <hi>ſubjects</hi> for the kingdom of heaven, without intimating the neceſſity of any change being wrought in them; the preſumption, therefore, is, that they are perfectly innocent.</p>
            <p>Whoever will be at the pains to contraſt the declarations of the Deity, <note place="margin">Ezek.xviii.</note> contained in Ezekiel, with the doctrines of Calvin and his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, will ſoon be convinced that they are as oppoſite to each other as light is to darkneſs.</p>
            <p>Ezekiel begins the chapter, by the command of God, ſaying, "What mean ye, that ye uſe this proverb concerning the land of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, ſaying, the father's have eaten
<pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:026523_0012_0FD08541C97D3AD0"/>
four grapes, and the children's teeth are ſet on edge?"</p>
            <p>He ſwears, <note place="margin">Ezek xviii. 3.</note> "That they ſhall not have occaſion any more, to uſe this proverb in Iſrael:" however, the Calviniſts have had great occaſion to make frequent uſe of it, ſince Ezekiel's time.</p>
            <p>He ſays, <note place="margin">4.</note> "Behold, all ſouls are mine, as the ſoul of the Father, ſo alſo the ſoul of the ſon, is mine, the ſoul that ſinneth it ſhall die."</p>
            <p>"Yet ſay ye, <note place="margin">19.</note> why doth not the ſon bear the iniquity of the father, when the ſon hath done that which is lawful and right, and hath kept all my ſtatutes, and hath done them, he ſhall ſurely live."</p>
            <p>"The ſoul that ſinneth, <note place="margin">20.</note> it ſhall die: the ſon ſhall not bear the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the father, neither ſhall the father bear the iniquity of the ſon, the righteouſneſs of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſhall be upon him, and the wickedneſs of the wicked ſhall be upon him."</p>
            <p>That is to ſay, that every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual ſhall ſuffer ſor their own
<pb n="xv" facs="unknown:026523_0013_0FD085669088F4B8"/>
tranſgreſſion, and not for that of any other perſon whatever.</p>
            <p>The Deity aſſerts, <note place="margin">Ezekiel xxviii. iv.</note> that all ſouls, without exception, are his proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; if ſo, they cannot belong to him and the Devil in common. However widely they may ſtray from the ſheep-fold for a time, the good ſhepherd will, in due time, bring them home rejoicing, ſaying, I have found that which was loſt. And it will puzzle the Devil and all his advocates, to find and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce that eternal decree, by which they pretend, that millions of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants were conſigned to him, to be and remain in the priſon of hell, to the endleſs ages of eternity:</p>
            <p>Or to prove from any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the ſcriptures of the Old or New Teſtaments, that God ever threatened to puniſh any infant in hell, for the ſins of their parents, or thoſe of any other perſon: and, as it is impoſſible, that thoſe who die in infancy, could ever offend him, in thought, word or deed; it is ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational to ſuppoſe he will puniſh
<pb n="xvi" facs="unknown:026523_0014_0FD0854353826E38"/>
them, for any ſuppoſed want of conformity in their natures to his divine law. Would not the man be ſtigmatized as a moſt mercileſs tyrant, who ſhould beget a vaſt number of children, and deliver the greateſt number of them, while infants, into the hands of the moſt mercileſs ſavages, to be tormented by them, in the manner uſually practiſed amongſt them, ſuch as roaſting them before ſlow fires, drawing out their <hi>nails,</hi> with red hot pincers, cauſing them to run bare-footed on hot embers, then to break the bliſters open, and rub in ſalt, to increaſe the anguiſh to the moſt extreme degree, while the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's ſtood by to approve and ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion their proceedings?</p>
            <p>I acknowledge that this charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is drawn in very black and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal colours; and I confeſs that I do not believe that the prince of Devils would act agreeable to it, were it in his power: but monſtrous and incredible as it may appear; ſuch is the character, and ſuch the
<pb n="xvii" facs="unknown:026523_0015_0FD08568136E03A8"/>
conduct attributed to the merciful and infinitely benevolent parent of mankind; with this additional ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating circumſtance, that the puniſhment, in the firſt ſuppoſed caſe, could be only of ſhort dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; while that ſuppoſed to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by the appointment of the Deity, is affirmed to be an eternal, never ending torture, of the moſt dreadful kind, in the regions of darkneſs and deſpair.</p>
            <p>This is the horrid form in which theſe ſhocking doctrines have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways preſented, themſelves to the mind of the author: how they may appear to thoſe who embrace them, he cannot tell; or how they can reconcile them, to the ideas that are generally conceived of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious attributes of the Deity, or what is generally reckoned juſt and merciful, among men in civil Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. A perſon would be naturally led to conceive, that the moral go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Deity, would be the moſt perfect model to imitate, in framing ours; but if the Calvin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtic
<pb n="xviii" facs="unknown:026523_0016_0FD08544D4EFE0E8"/>
plan is to be adopted, the only imitations of it appears to be the inquiſitions of Spain and Portugal; but it is very queſtionable, whether they ever proceeded ſo far, as to <hi>burn infants</hi> for the crimes of their parents. If any perſon ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the author of this little tract, has ſhewn too great a degree of warmth, or made uſe of any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions calculated to give offence, it will give him ſenſible concern; but if this ſhould be the caſe, he aſſures the reader, that it never was his intention to offend the people of any denomination: his ſole mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive being to vindicate the moral character of the Deity; which, as he humbly conceives, has been groſsly miſrepreſented, to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor of God, and the unſpeakable detriment of mankind—who ſhould be taught to copy after the Deity, in all his immitable perfections: if, therefore, we form erroneous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of the character and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Deity, with reſpect to his diſpoſition and government of
<pb n="xix" facs="unknown:026523_0017_0FD085698F78DC78"/>
the children of men, it is almoſt morally certain, that our conduct, to each other, will be influenced by our opinions. If a bigot conceives that God hates any denomination of Chriſtians, or even the Heathen, it is highly improbable that he ſhould love them, or treat them with kindneſs—as he will think himſelf juſtifiable in hating whom God hates: and it is unlikely that Calvin would have burned Servetus for hereſy, if he had not perſuaded himſelf, that God hated him from all eternity, and would puniſh him in hell, throughout eternal ages.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>MY DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHEN I had the pleaſure of converſing with you, a few evenings ago, I ſtated a few propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, tending to analize the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the eternal duration of hell torments; ſo as to have the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject compriſed in a ſmall compaſs, on a few ſelf evident principles.—But as the ſubject is of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, involving in its diſcuſſion and deciſion, the juſt or erroneous opinion we are to form of the moral character of the Deity; that is, whether we ſhall believe that the Deity has created millions of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man beings, <hi>knowing</hi> with <hi>certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> before he brought them into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, that they would prove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible ſinners, incur his divine diſpleaſure, and that he, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, ſhould conſign them to
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:026523_0020_0FD08548A0625438"/>
eternal puniſhment in the regions of miſery and woe:</p>
            <p>Or, whether he created them with the benevolent <hi>deſign</hi> or <hi>wiſh</hi> that they might all be eventually happy, knowing that he had ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient abilities to fulfil his gracious intention. I would beg leave to ſtate the following queries: viz.</p>
            <p>Query I. When the Deity conceived the deſign of creating, or cauſing ſo many millions of human beings to exiſt; did he <hi>wiſh</hi> or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign</hi> that they ſhould all be even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually happy? Or did he not wiſh them final happineſs?</p>
            <p>Query II. Did he know what their future conduct in this life would be?</p>
            <p>Query III. Was he poſſeſſed of a ſufficient degree of <hi>wiſdom</hi> to form a <hi>plan</hi> whereby the whole human race might be reſcued from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal miſery?</p>
            <p>Query IV. Had he a ſufficient degree of power to execute his plan, and ſave the whole human race from eternal perdition?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:026523_0021_0FD0856CC30FE3C8"/>If it be granted, as I conclude it muſt be; that the Deity was ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent as to <hi>wiſh</hi> that the whole human race might be eventually happy;</p>
            <p>That he knew before hand what the conduct of each individual would be;</p>
            <p>That he had <hi>wiſdom</hi> enough to form a <hi>plan</hi> to effect his gracious deſign;</p>
            <p>And a ſufficient degree of <hi>power</hi> to execute his <hi>plan</hi> and ſave the whole human race from eternal perdition;</p>
            <p>Query V. What <hi>power,</hi> or combination of <hi>powers</hi> can <hi>fruſtrate</hi> the <hi>deſigns</hi> of the <hi>Omnipotent Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vab,</hi> and drag theſe beings to end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs perdition, which he intended ſhould be eventually happy?</p>
            <p>Query VI. What degree of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit are we to give to the opinion of thoſe who tell us, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the infinite <hi>goodneſs, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and <hi>Almighty power,</hi> of the <hi>Deity</hi> are engaged to <hi>ſave</hi> the whole race, vaſt numbers of them muſt,

nevertheleſs, be irrecoverably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinged to the Devil, to be torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him to the endleſs ages of eternity? Nay, there are many who allege that the poſterity of Adam are brought into being, with a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and moral incapacity of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any <hi>good</hi>; but with a ſtrong propenſity, and infinite power to do evil. In conſequence of which diſpoſition and power, every ſin which they commit is an infinite evil, and every ſubſequent tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which they commit, being alſo an infinite evil, the ſum total be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes infinitely infinite; render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the miſerable culprit juſtly liable to eternal puniſhment, for acting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably to the conſtitution and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſities of his nature, with which the Deity impelled him into exiſtence.</p>
            <p>Query VII. Is it not impious to ſuppoſe, that an infinitely good and merciful God, ſhould bring into exiſtence millions of human be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, under a moral incapacity of doing good; but with the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt inherent propenſities and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

               </gap> are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely evil; thereby to furniſh a plauſible pretext to juſtify the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of puniſhing them eternally?</p>
            <p>If this doctrine be well founded, the Devil could not have wiſhed for a plan more, or better calculated to people his dominions.</p>
            <p>The Calviniſts ſuppoſe the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reverſe of our fortune, with reſpect to the benevolent diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Deity towards us, to have been cauſed by the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and fall of Adam: for, ſay they, "Mankind by their fall loſt communion with God, are under his <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>curſe,</hi> and ſo made liable to all the miſeries of this life, to death itſelf, and to the pains of <hi>hell forever</hi>!"</p>
            <p>Query VIII. What a ſhocking idea do they entertain of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral character of the Deity, and his divine government! Who can ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a human being juſtly liable to God's <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>curſe</hi> in this life, and to the <hi>pain</hi> of <hi>hell forever,</hi> for a crime committed by another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:026523_0024_0FD0854B8D3FA9A0"/>
five or ſix thouſand years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the imputed culprit had an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence?</p>
            <p>Query IX. Was Adam's future conduct and fall, a matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingency with the Deity? Nay, he certainly knew that he would eat the forbidden fruit; why then ſhould his wrath and indignation riſe to ſuch a tremendous pitch, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt millions of unborn, innocent beings, whoſe poſſible future ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence depended entirely on his own agency; which is as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the production of a human being at this time, as in producing Adam out of the duſt of the earth?</p>
            <p>Query X. Is it not more ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, more agreeable to ſcripture, and more conſiſtent with the ideas we ought to entertain of the kind pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of the human race, to believe, with the Univerſaliſts, that he cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated the whole human race, with the benevolent deſign of making them all eventually happy; that he had <hi>wiſdom</hi> enough to form his <hi>plan</hi>; and <hi>power</hi> enough to <hi>execute</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:026523_0025_0FD0856F914C7F50"/>
it; that he has made them moral, accountable agents: for which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he has endued them with knowledge to diſtinguiſh between good and evil; a free will to chooſe, and a power to act agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to their choice? Where either of theſe three powers or faculties are withheld, or are imperfect, the duties expected of the agent, will be proportionally diminiſhed; an idiot not being in any degree ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for his actions.</p>
            <p>If, therefore, we make an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper uſe of our free agency, and are led or impelled by our appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites or paſſions, or any kind of temptation, to do any action which we know to be wrong or criminal, whether we gain our knowledge from revelation or reaſon, we are equally criminal. If we neglect to perform any known duty, we are alſo criminal. If we neglect to improve the means of gaining knowledge reſpecting our duties towards God and man, our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance cannot be plead in mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:026523_0026_0FD0854D0C1EBCC8"/>
of our crimes, as our ignorance is not inevitable; but cauſed by neglect. The Deity, in all ſuch caſes, will correct, and ſometimes puniſh ſinners with ſeverity; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably he may puniſh ſome refrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ſinners for ages; but ſtill, like a kind parent, for the ſole purpoſe of reclaiming them.</p>
            <p>The only valuable end or deſign of puniſhment, is the reformation of the being puniſhed. But in all caſes where this end cannot be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and the offender can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented from injuring other beings; the farther infliction of puniſhment can have no other motive than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, which can anſwer no valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able purpoſe. It would be better after having puniſhed them to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree adequate to their crimes, to ſuffer them to drop into a ſtate of non-exiſtence, than to keep them ſinning and ſuffering eternally.</p>
            <p>If ſin is diſpleaſing to the Deity, the ſins and blaſphemies committed in <hi>hell,</hi> muſt alſo diſpleaſe him;— but it ſeems he is willing to diſpenſe
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:026523_0027_0FD085710EB620E8"/>
with this inconvenience, for the pleaſure of puniſhing them to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, that the eternal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the wicked may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned as an example to others, to deter them from acting as they had done. I aſk, to whom can their puniſhment be a neceſſary exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? Surely not to the wicked in this life, who neither hear their groans, nor ſee their ſufferings— Certainly not to the bleſſed in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, who can neither be benefited, nor gratified by ſuch an horrid ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle. It certainly muſt be to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the Devil, as it affords him the pleaſure of triumphing over the Saviour of mankind. Here, may he ſay, are the millions you fondly imagined you could reſcue from my power; for them you left the boſom of your father; for them you aſſumed the human form; for them you ſuffered many hardſhips and indignities; for them you ſhed your blood on the croſs; but after all this parade, behold, they are
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:026523_0028_0FD0854FABC5EAD8"/>
mine <hi>eternally</hi>; you tried to ſave them, but you could not! Is this the triumphant victory the Saviour of mankind was to gain over the powers of darkneſs? Is it all to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate in peopling the infernal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, with thoſe very beings, who the eternal Father of mercies wiſhed and intended ſhould be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally happy, in ſinging his praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es world without end? Is it not more conſiſtent with the ideas we ought to entertain of the infinite <hi>goodneſs, wiſdom</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of God, to ſuppoſe that the Saviour of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind will go on <hi>conquering</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to <hi>conquer,</hi> until he has releaſed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry human being, who had been held in captivity by the enemy of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; correcting them for their tranſgreſſions, with the rod of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, and alluring them by his tender mercies and loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, until they become willing in the day of his power, to enliſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, as the Captain of their ſalvation, that after he has gained this compleat <hi>victory</hi> over the <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:026523_0029_0FD08572D16EF3A0"/>
of <hi>darkneſs</hi>; he will deliver up the kingdom <hi>entire</hi> to his Father, that God may be all in all?</p>
            <p>But on the other hand, ſhould we ſuppoſe the <hi>Saviour,</hi> when he comes to give an account of the <hi>ſucceſs</hi> of his <hi>miſſion,</hi> and deliver up the <hi>kingdom</hi> to his <hi>Father</hi>; to tell him, I have done my beſt to ſave the whole human race; but I found their natures ſo completely derang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and corrupted by Adam's fall, and their appetites and paſſions ſo though vitiated, and the Devil ſo amazingly artful and cunning in ſuiting his temptations to their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt appetites and paſſions; that I was at length obliged to come to a compromiſe with him, and give him up nine-tenths of the human race to recover one tenth? This would afford but ſmall grounds for a triumph.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>MY DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHEN I preſumed ſome time ago to trouble you with my ſentiments concerning the final reſtoration of the human race; I conſidered the ſubject, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected our ideas of the unlimited preſcience, goodneſs, wiſdom, and almighty power of God. And I am ſtill perſuaded that this is the moſt rational method of inveſtigat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this important ſubject: for if the Deity be omniſcient, he muſt have known what would eventual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be the fate of every individual created being. If he is infinitely <hi>good</hi> and <hi>merciful,</hi> he muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly wiſh to make them even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually happy. If he be infinitely
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:026523_0031_0FD0855250277F80"/>
wiſe, he muſt have laid his plan, ſo as to prevent being fruſtrated in the accompliſhment of his gracious deſign. And if infinitely <hi>power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> all the obſtructions or obſtacles that the united powers of all cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated beings could oppoſe to the operations of his almighty will, would be in vain; nay, worſe than in vain.</p>
            <p>If, therefore, any number of the human race, are to be conſigned to the Devil, to be tormented in the regions of darkneſs and deſpair, to the endleſs ages of eternity, it muſt happen in conſequence of ſome defect in the preſcience, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, wiſdom, or power of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. To ſuppoſe the infinitely merciful and good God, capable of forcing any number of human beings into exiſtence, without wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make the condition into which he brought them equal, if not preferable, to a ſtate of non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtence, is ſhocking, (and I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume there are but few, if any, who will aſſert, that a ſtate of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:026523_0032_0FD085740EE2F960"/>
puniſhment, is either equal or preferable to non-exiſtence.)</p>
            <p>But, ſuppoſing him to have known, from all eternity, that they would be moſt exquiſitely miſerable throughout eternal ages, without any poſſibility of relief; is to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the ever merciful Jehovah guilty of an unprovoked act of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty: for it is certain non-entities could not offend him. It is, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, dealing unfairly with the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Deity, to charge him with an act of cruelty of which no human being would be guilty.— What man would beget a child, provided he knew with certainty before band, that it would be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally miſerable? I preſume there is not one to be found, that would not ſhudder at the thought of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtrumental in producing a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, knowing it ſhould inevitably bear the moſt excrutiating tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the regions of darkneſs, deſpair, and woe, as long as God himſelf exiſted! But ſhocking as it is, this is the character that has
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:026523_0033_0FD08553D1084290"/>
been given to the beneficient pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of mankind, who is the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme fountain of love and mercy. 1 <note place="margin">1 Tim.

               <salute>My DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE trade of idol-making is a very ancient buſineſs; and has been practiſed, with very little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption, ſince the days of Serah. The firſt ſtep taken by almoſt every ſyſtem-builder is, to fabricate a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity: but it ſometimes happens, that he finds one ready made to his hand; in which caſe, he has only to furniſh him with a ſet of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes to ſuit his purpoſe; and the temper and diſpoſition of the workman, may be infalibly known by the attributes with which he equips his deity.—Calvin was a tyrant; he cauſed poor Servetus to be burned, becauſe he had the audacity to differ from him in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:026523_0045_0FD07E41301BD390"/>
being bred a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> he had contracted a fondneſs for the dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty who preſided over the inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe he was ſuppoſed to burn all thoſe in hell to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, who they burned here on earth for hereſy; —not becauſe they had ſinned againſt him, and had provoked him to bring them into exiſtence; —but becauſe he foreknew and decreed they ſhould become ſinners, that he might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by have an opportunity of display<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Almighty power, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying his vindictive juſtice, by puniſhing them to the endleſs ages of eternity, for acting agreeably to the nature and diſpoſitions with which he brought them into be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; —for the Calviniſts aſſert, that the poſterity of Adam, are born with the moſt invincible propenſity to do evil, and as entirely incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble either to will or to do any good, as a dead man is to raiſe himſelf up, and perform the actions and functions of a living perſon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſpecial aid and aſſiſtance of
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:026523_0046_0FD0857F4FD423A8"/>
the Spirit of God, which he has a free <hi>ſovereign right,</hi> either to <hi>grant</hi> or <hi>with hold,</hi> which he exerciſes without any refference to the <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad diſpoſition,</hi> or <hi>conduct</hi> of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe whom he has <hi>elected</hi> from all eternity to everlaſting life; or thoſe conſigned to eternal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment by an arbitrary <hi>decree</hi>; as he is ſuppoſed to be under no kind of obligation to the creatures he has made, and to have a free ſovereign right to do, as he pleaſes with them, as a potter has with an inſenſible lump of clay.</p>
            <p>I readily grant that Chriſt has a ſovereign right, and am perſuaded that he has a diſpoſition to pardon Judas who betrayed him, and the Jews who murdered him, together with the whole of the inhabitants of Sodom, Samaria, and Jeruſalem: But I <hi>poſitively deny</hi> that he has either a <hi>ſovereign right,</hi> or a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition ſo devoid of mercy; as to create an immortal rattle-ſnake, on purpoſe to make it eternally mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, for acting agreeable to the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:026523_0047_0FD08580C7436BB8"/>
nature and diſpoſition, with which he brought it into being. Would it not be a more ſafe and certain method of gaining <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the moral character of the Deity, and his diſpoſition to wards the children of Men, to collect it from the divine precepts, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Chriſt, than to ſearch for it in the works of Calvin, Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, Toplady, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Chriſt tells his hearers in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon on the Mount.</p>
            <p>"Ye have heard that it has been ſaid, <note place="margin">

He incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates theſe principles as correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the true moral character of the Father of mercies; for he ſubjoins in the 45 "that ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his ſun to ſhine on the evil and on
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:026523_0048_0FD085A70D83F218"/>
the good, &amp;c." He further encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages them in the 48th verſe, to proceed in the practice of theſe godlike virtues, that they might imitate the Deity in his moral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; ſaying, "Be ye perfect, even as your Father which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is perfect."</p>
            <p>This is, undoubtedly, a true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the diſpoſition and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral character of the greateſt and beſt of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> which Chriſt wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his hearers to imitate, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he could not have given us a better pattern.</p>
            <p>And theſe divine precepts he ſanctioned and confirmed by his own example. When ſuffering the moſt excrutiating torments on the croſs, he prayed for his moſt bitter enemies and murderers, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." If, therefore, Chriſt prayed to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and made interceſſion for thoſe who were murdering him, while, in the moſt bitter agonies; who can reaſonably doubt that he will not be diſpoſed to intercede for the leſs
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:026523_0049_0FD0858284FBB608"/>
criminal part of mankind; or that his interceſſion will not prevail with the Father of mercies to forgive them. Chriſt prayed for the whole promiſcuous group; if they were not, nor will not be eventually pardoned; then Chriſt's <hi>interceſſion</hi> for them is <hi>unavailing.</hi> If they are <hi>forgiven,</hi> it is very remarkable that none except Calvin's <hi>elected, predeſtinated</hi> ſaints, ſhould be the only perſons concerned in crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Saviour of the world.</p>
            <p>The above principles and facts, does not evince the Deity to be ſuch an inexorable, cruel being, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny well-meaning people have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him to be. They ſhould, therefore, be <hi>cautious,</hi> and not charge the Deity with <hi>partiality</hi> and <hi>cruelty</hi> in the diſpenſations of his providence, with the children of men. Chriſt aſſures us, in the 22d Verſe, of the aforementioned Chapter; "That whoever ſhall call his brother a fool, ſhall be in danger of hell fire." what then muſt the danger of that perſon be,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:026523_0050_0FD085A887F239B8"/>
who calls his maker a tyrant?— God forbid, ſays the Calviniſt, that I ſhould call God a tyrant! I only affirm that he has brought millions of human beings into exiſtence, out of a ſtate of non-exiſtence, in which condition they were incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of either offending him, or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering any inconvenience, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, <hi>knowing,</hi> and having <hi>prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined</hi> that they ſhould be <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in bell flames,</hi> to the <hi>endleſs ages of eternity</hi>! Although I muſt confeſs it cannot be called a very merciful diſpenſation of Providence, I dare not call it tyranny. We are taught to believe that God knows every event that ſhall ever come to paſs, he having eſtabliſhed and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, every poſſible event by irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable decrees; ſo that nothing can happen contrary to his ſovereign appointments, as will fully appear by peruſing our Weſtminster confeſſion of faith, and catechiſm, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the above tenets, viz.</p>
            <p>Queſtion. What are the decrees of God?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:026523_0051_0FD08583CD3E55C8"/>Anſwer. The decrees of God are his eternal purpſe, according to the council of his own will, whereby, for his own <hi>glory,</hi> he hath foreordained whatſoever comes to paſs. He decreed that he would, in time, create a man and woman, by the names of Adam and Eve, and conſtitute Adam the head and repreſentative of all his poſterity; that he would enter into a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him, on condition, that if he abſtained from eating the fruit of a certain tree, himſelf and all his poſterity ſhould be happy; but if he taſted the forbidden fruit, himſelf and all his poſterity ſhould loſe communion with God, be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his wrath and curſe, and ſo made liable to all the miſeries of this life, to death itſelf, and to the pains of hell forever! And that in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of Adam's tranſgreſſion all his poſterity ſhould be born with the moſt invincible propenſities to do evil, and both a natural and moral incapacity of doing any good, or even to will to do a good
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:026523_0052_0FD085AA144EBB00"/>
action, and leaſt their natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſities to do evil, aided by the temptations of the Devil, ſhould not inſtigate them ſufficiently to fill up the meaſure of their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Deity is ſuppoſed to have decreed every evil action which they ſhould commit; ſuch as thefts, robberies, rapes, murders, &amp;c. For all which crimes and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he has alſo decreed to puniſh the greateſt number of the ſouls which he has made in <hi>hell,</hi> to the endleſs ages of eternity: for if the Deity has decreed <hi>whatſoever</hi> comes to paſs, all theſe crimes and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations have come to paſs, and therefore muſt have been included; for, ſay they, ſince God is omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, it is evident that he foreſaw from everlaſting, whatever ſhould come to paſs; but there can be no preſcience for future contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents: for what is certainly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen, muſt infallibly come to paſs; conſequently, the preſcience of the Deity cannot be antecedent to his decrees. They ſuppoſe that the
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:026523_0053_0FD085854A0C9DD8"/>
Deity, by a free ſovereign act of partiality, (he not being under the ſmalleſt obligation imaginable to regard the well being of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures he has made,) had choſen a certain number in Chriſt, unto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting glory, before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world, according to his immutable purpoſe, and of his free grace and love, without the leaſt reference to faith, good works, or any conditions to be performed by the creature: and as he loved thoſe he elected without any rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal motive, ſo he alſo hated thoſe he reprobated on the ſame ground, and left the poor wretched beings, which he dragged into exiſtence under his unprovoked diſpleaſure, not to be governed by the freedom of their own will, like moral ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable agents but puſhed on to the greateſt degree of guilt and wretchedneſs, by acting as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity had foreknown and decreed they ſhould do!

non-entities can ſuffer no inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, and cannot offend the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity? By this means two great evils would have been avoided; to wit, the infinite torment of created be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the great diſpleaſure of the Creator.</p>
            <p>But, ſay they, he has permitted all this evil and miſery to make his almighty power known in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ſinners.

            <p>It is alſo ſuppoſed, that he rendered finite beings incapable of doing good, and capable of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infinite evil, to afford him an opportunity of ſhewing his infinite averſion to ſin and ſinners, and to gratify his vindictive juſtice in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing them eternally.

            <p>To ſay he wiſhed that they might all be eventually happy, but knew

infallibly before he created them, that great numbers would be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally and irrecoverably miſerable—is an abſurdity too great to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in the religious code of any denomination of chriſtians: that is, God is ſuppoſed to bring into exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence millions of <hi>unoffending beings, wiſhing</hi> and <hi>deſigning</hi> that they ſhould be eventually <hi>happy,</hi> but <hi>knowing infallibly,</hi> long before he cauſed them to exiſt, that they ſhould be <hi>eternally</hi> and <hi>irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly miſerable</hi>; it not being in the power of the greateſt number to <hi>avoid it,</hi> and the Deity had prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined never to uſe any <hi>effectual means</hi> to <hi>prevent it,</hi> although his infinite wiſdom and power could have eaſily effected it.</p>
            <p>The ſcriptures inform us, that God made all things for himſelf; but our moſt orthodox teachers, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us, that this is a grand miſtake, he having made by far the greateſt number of the poſterity of Adam for the <hi>Devil, knowing</hi> and <hi>intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> that they ſhould be his <hi>ſlaves</hi>

            <p>Having contraſted the tenets and doctrines of theſe two different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominations of chriſtians, let us alſo contraſt the obvious tendencies of their reſpective tenets, on the lives and morals of their diſciples.</p>
            <p>When the young Calviniſtic pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil begins to learn his catechiſm, and is there told; "That me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of God are his eternal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, according to the council of his own will; whereby, for his own glory, he hath foreordained whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever comes to paſs." That the Deity had, from all eternity, elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a few individuals, to everlaſting life and glory; and ſentenced by far the greateſt number of the ſouls which he determined to create, by a decree of reprobation, to eternal wretchedneſs, and never ending mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery—for his <hi>own glory,</hi> without any reference or reſpect, to what the diſpoſition or conduct of the beings to be created might be:
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:026523_0076_0FD085BC132ADC40"/>
which predeſtinated fates, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for any of them to alter, reverſe or avoid, whether it be to eternal happineſs or endleſs miſery, by any thing that they can will or perform.</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible that the unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced mind can view this charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in any other light, than that of an arbitrary, cruel, mercileſs ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, forcing unoffending millions into exiſtence, on purpoſe to make them eternally miſerable—for his own glory.</p>
            <p>But to ſilence all enquiry and cavalling, they are told that this is an holy myſtery; that it is danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to reply againſt God, or diſpute the decrees of his ſovereign will, who has the ſame right and power to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate one ſoul, on purpoſe to make it everlaſtingly happy, and another to be eternally miſerable, as a potter has to make one veſſel to honor, and another to diſhonor; out of the ſame inſenſible lump of clay.</p>
            <p>Their weak judgments being ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtunned and confounded, than
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:026523_0077_0FD085974B63F460"/>
convinced and enlightened by ſuch dogmatical ſtuff, (for it cannot be called reaſoning) they continue to contemplate the Deity, as a tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendouſly powerful, partial ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, the common enemy of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, who had, moſt probably, brought <hi>them</hi> into exiſtence, to make them eternally miſerable, and ſometimes pray to him, as the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans pray to the Devil, not out of love—for that is impoſſible; but out of fear, leaſt they are of the number appointed to be eternally damned, for the <hi>honor</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> of this inexorable being: and although they are unwilling to be ſacrificed to the honor and <hi>glory</hi> of the Deity themſelves, they have no material objection to his dealing, as he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, with the reſt of the human race, provided they eſcape themſelves: for as it is impoſſible for them to love God, as long as they conceive him to be a partial tyrant, it cannot be expected that they ſhould love his creatures.</p>
            <p>In this condition they generally
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:026523_0078_0FD085BDCD3689B0"/>
remain ſome time, until many that I have known, begin to reaſon thus: If I am elected to eternal life, by an abſolute decree of the Deity, my ſalvation is <hi>certain,</hi> let me do or act is I pleaſe; but if I have been reprobated by an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal decree, before I exiſted, all I can do by prayer, faſting, tears and penitence, will never influence the Deity to reverſe his decrees; and as he doomed me to everlaſting miſery long before I had offended him, I certainly cannot be under any obligation to him on the ſcore of gratitude, for forcing me into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, on purpoſe to make me eternally miſerable: and as I am to be precluded from even the ſhadow of happineſs hereafter, I am reſolved to gratify every ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al appetite and paſſion, and enjoy all the happineſs I can in this life.</p>
            <p>If God has foreordained whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever comes to paſs, I cannot act contrary to his decrees, let me do as I will; but why his decrees ſhould be contrary to his laws, I
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:026523_0079_0FD08598CED88598"/>
cannot tell; or why he ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and diſapprove the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, my teachers have not explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; they only affirm it to be for God's <hi>glory,</hi> that it ſhould be ſo; but ſurely there muſt be ſome miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in this doctrine. We are told, at one time, that the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is, of all beings, the moſt wiſe, juſt and benevolent; that mercy is his darling attribute; and that he is no partial reſpecter of perſons: and at another, that he is partial, cruel, revengeful and unjuſt—both theſe cannot be true.</p>
            <p>How can God be glorified in the eternal damnation of a being which he created for that very purpoſe? Can God be a merciful being, and yet take delight in creating ſouls which he foreknew would be eternally miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able? If the real character of the Deity is diſcoverable, it certainly is not to be found in this incohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent chaos of contradictions.</p>
            <p>Thus reaſon and common ſenſe conſpire to combat the horrid idea which he had conceived of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorable
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:026523_0080_0FD085BF1650D460"/>
Jehovah, until he meets with a Deiſt, who had been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded while young, that <hi>Calviniſm</hi> was the doctrine taught by the apoſtles; but finding it an incohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent collection of ſelf-evident con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, had too haſtily rejected the ſcriptures, without comparing them with the doctrines, ſaid to be taught in the ſacred pages. The Deiſt explains to him the nature and adorable perfections of God, as far as they have been diſcovered by man; aided by both reaſon and revelation, which he finds to be ſo vaſtly diſcordant, with what he has been taught to believe, concerning the deſigns of the Deity, in creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the human ſpecies, and his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition towards them; that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the ſcriptures alſo; as teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doctrines unworthy of God, and diſhonorable to his holy name: and ſo, by relinquiſhing one egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious error, he embraces another, and turns Deiſt.</p>
            <p>Others, again, who have been taught this doctrine, ſee no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:026523_0081_0FD0859B0FDAF9A8"/>
for either praying or preaching, as they are perſuaded, that if all the angels in heaven, and all the ſaints on earth, were to intercede with the Deity—to take one ſingle ſoul into heaven, which he had not elected to everlaſting life, from all eternity, he would not do it. Thoſe who were made for the Devil, muſt go to the Devil, and be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by him to the endleſs ages of eternity; for the <hi>honor</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>Thus are numbers taught from infancy, to hate the God that made them, on purpoſe to make them happy; and to live under the moſt dreadful apprehenſions of his <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> and <hi>wrath</hi> on the one hand, and that of the Devil, on the other.—In this dilemma, they ſometimes fly to the prieſts, and enquire what they ſhall do to be ſaved; the good man examines them, with reſpect to the ſtate of their feelings and diſpoſitions, and generally finds them extremely afraid of being eternally damned, for the <hi>glory</hi> of
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:026523_0082_0FD085C1AFC23DF8"/>
               <hi>God</hi>; this is called ſpiritual <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,</hi> and is eſteemed a favourable ſymptom. They are directed to pray; but they cannot addreſs the Deity, as the benevolent parent of mankind, the God of infinite love and mercy. The prejudices of an early education, are not eaſily era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated. They have been uſed to look upon God as their <hi>natural ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> and cannot confide in him, as a friend; until they can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, by ſome means, that they are of the elected number: and then they begin to love God, in ſome degree, which they found, by experience, to be impoſſible, while they conceived him to be their enemy; but now, ſince they conceive themſelves to be of the number of the choſen few, they cheerfully acquieſce in the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of Providence, and extol the diſintereſted generoſity of the Deity, in creating more ſouls for the Devil, than for himſelf: thus they make friends of two dreadful powerful beings, whoſe enmity
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:026523_0083_0FD0859C8CD1EBE0"/>
they dreaded. They imagine that they flatter the Deity, by affirming, that he had an undoubted right to <hi>create millions,</hi> on purpoſe to damn them eternally, for his own glory. They alſo gratify the Devil, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to prove his abſolute indefeaſible right to, and property in, all the ſouls he may once get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his poſſeſſion, on pretence, that they were conſigned to him by the Deity, by a ſovereign decree, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were created.</p>
            <p>The Univerſaiiſt is taught to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that God is the moſt pure, holy, wiſe, benevolent, merciful, juſt and powerful being, in exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</p>
            <p>That he created every ſubordinate intelligent being, for his own <hi>glory</hi>; but that his glory is diſplayed to the greateſt poſſible advantage, in the final ſalvation and everlaſting hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of every being, which he has or may create;</p>
            <p>That God never did; nor ever will, create any being which he did
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:026523_0084_0FD085C2DA67DF58"/>
not wiſh to eſtabliſh in a ſtate of permanent happineſs;</p>
            <p>That he had <hi>wiſdom</hi> enough to form a <hi>plan,</hi> in which his deſigns cannot be <hi>fruſtrated,</hi> and <hi>power</hi> ſufficient to enable him to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh all his purpoſes; which are equitable, juſt and merciful. They love God, being firmly perſuaded that God firſt loved them, and brought them into exiſtence, on purpoſe to make them eternally happy: but foreſeeing that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind would make an improper uſe of their free agency, and become ſinners, he ſent his only begotten Son, to be the propitiation for the ſins of the whole world, and to taſte death for every man.</p>
            <p>The law was broken by man, and the man <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as our great high prieſt, has made an ample at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for the breach of the law. Whatever demands juſtice might have had againſt human nature, for a breach of the divine law, they were paid to the laſt farthing, by Chriſt, as our repreſentative, in
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:026523_0085_0FD0859E11B0DEA0"/>
our ſtead: and if juſtice has been once ſatisfied—from whence does this new claim ariſe? Does juſtice require that Chriſt ſhould be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified a ſecond time? For he is our Surety, and the demand muſt be againſt him. He is our prophet, prieſt and king; and we are his ſubjects; he has redeemed us with his precious blood; and we are confident he never will relinquiſh one ſoul to the Devil, which he has made.</p>
            <p>It is our duty, as well as our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to ſerve God, and obey the commands and precepts of Chriſt, to whom we are anſwerable at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; for the Father hath delivered every thing appertaining to our ſalvation, into the hands of the Son: and we are confident that he will be faithful to his truſt, and loſe nothing that has been commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his charge, but raiſe it up at the laſt day; "for this is the will of the Father, who hath ſent him, to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt.
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:026523_0086_0FD085C456016C40"/>
For this purpoſe the Son of God was manifeſted, that he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the works of the Devil: and not his works only, but the Devil himſelf. And to deliver them who through fear of death, were all their <hi>life time</hi> ſubject to bondage. Wherefore he is able alſo to ſave them to the uttermoſt, that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth, to make interceſſion for them."</p>
            <p>When the children of men tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, they believe the Lord will chaſten and correct them, when he finds it neceſſary, to reform or reclaim them; but never out of revenge, or any delight he takes in the miſery of his creatures.— "For the Lord will not caſt off forever: but though he cauſe grief, yet will he have compaſſion, according to the multitude of his mercies. <note place="margin">Lam. iii. 31-33.</note> For he doth not afflict wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, nor grieve the children of men."

            <head>LETTER IV. TO A FRIEND.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MY DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AS the chriſtian world has been greatly divided in opinion, reſpecting the motives which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the Deity to create the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſpecies, and his deſigns and intentions, with reſpect to their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture face; as they are queſtions of great importance to human beings, both with reſpect to the ideas they are to form of the moral character of the Deity, and their own moral conduct, which ſhould be conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his.</p>
            <p>It is natural for you to enquire; whether it is not poſſible to gain a ſatisfactory knowledge of a ſubject, which ſo nearly concerns us, and yet appears ſo vaſtly intricate, that notwithſtanding the numerous vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:026523_0093_0FD085A416B4BE80"/>
that have been wrote upon the ſubject no rational concluſion, founded upon ſelf-evident princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, has ever been made by the advocates for the eternal duration of hell torments; and yet they are ready to anathematize every perſon who cannot believe all the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contradictory opinions, in which they cannot agree themſelves:— ſome aſſerting that God wiſhed to convert and <hi>ſave</hi> the whole human race, but <hi>could</hi> not; others, that he <hi>could convert</hi> and <hi>ſave</hi> them <hi>all,</hi> but <hi>will not</hi>; he having doomed great numbers of them to eternal perdition, by an arbitrary decree, long before they exiſted, and that he had created them for this very purpoſe. While others deny that God decreed that any perſon ſhould inevitably be miſerable to the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ages of eternity; but moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and infallibly knew, that they would be ſo, even before he created them. While a few other perſons believe, that God created every human being, with an expreſs
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:026523_0094_0FD085CB11504428"/>
and poſitive deſign, to make them all eventually happy; and affirm that he is poſſeſſed of a ſufficient degree of wiſdom and power, to enable him to accompliſh his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent deſign. As you appear to be ſo benevolent as to wiſh every individual of the human race might be happy: I will endeavour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you that the doctrine is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the glorious attributes of God; on the ſcriptures, and the ſelf-evident principles of reaſon and common ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Let us proceed then to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant inveſtigation, and enquire;</p>
            <p>Queſtion I. What motive induced the Deity to create ſuch an immenſe number of human beings?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. To gratify his infinite beneficence, in conferring on them bleſſings, both temporal and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and the univerſal diſplay of his glorious attributes and perfections in the manifeſtations of providence, in their government.</p>
            <p>Queſtion II. Is it certain, that he wiſhed or intended, that all the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:026523_0095_0FD085A589D21190"/>
beings which he created might be happy?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. He certainly did;— otherwiſe he would not be as bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent as our common parents. And to ſuppoſe the Deity capable of ſorcing any number of human beings into exiſtence, without wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make the condition into which he brought them, equal, if not preferable to a ſtate of non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtence—would be charging him with an unprovoked act of cruelty: for it is certain that non-entities could not have offended him; it is therefore evident, that he never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended any of them ſhould be even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually miſerable, when he created them: but, on the contrary, it is declared, <note place="margin">1 Tim. ii. 4.</note> "That <hi>God will</hi> have <hi>all men</hi> to be <hi>ſaved,</hi> and come unto the knowledge of the truth."</p>
            <p>Queſtion III. If God willed that all men ſhould be ſaved; had he wiſdom ſufficient to enable him to form a plan, to accompliſh his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent deſign?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="unknown:026523_0096_0FD085CC8D0D2408"/>Anſwer. His wiſdom is infinite, and his goodneſs unlimitted, and the love of Chriſt unbounded, "Who gave himſelf a <hi>ranſom</hi> for all, <note place="margin">2 Tim. vi.</note> to be <hi>teſtified</hi> in <hi>due time.</hi>"—</p>
            <p>Queſtion IV. Has he a ſufficient degree of power to execute his plan?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. A union of the power of all created beings, would ſtill be finite; and therefore, fail in an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to oppoſe or counteract the <hi>deſigns</hi> and <hi>operations</hi> of the <hi>omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> Jehovah. If then it has been proved, that the Deity is ſo bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent as to <hi>wiſh</hi> all men to be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that he had wiſdom enough to form a plan to effect his gracious deſign; and a ſufficient degree of power to execute his plan, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh his deſign.</p>
            <p>Queſtion V. What power, or combination of powers, terreſtrial and infernal, ſhall prevail againſt Jehovah, and fruſtrate his deſigns? So that if any of the human race are to be eternally loſt, it muſt be ſuch as God never wiſhed to ſave;
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:026523_0097_0FD085EF0F634138"/>
which impeaches his infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>That the Deity did, and ſtill does intend, to ſave the whole human race, is abundantly evident, from the whole tenor of the ſcriptures; if they are examined without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice. <note place="margin">Rom. V. 13.</note> "Therefore, as by the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>one</hi> judgement came upon <hi>all men</hi> to condemnation, <hi>even ſo,</hi> by the righteouſneſs of <hi>one,</hi> the free gift came upon <hi>all men</hi> unto the juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of life. If God juſtifieth <hi>all men</hi> by the merits and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt. Who ſhall preſume to condemn them?</p>
            <p>"For the love of Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraineth us, <note place="margin">2 Cor. v. 14.</note> becauſe we thus judge, that if one died for <hi>all,</hi> then were <hi>all dead.</hi>"</p>
            <p>"And that he died for <hi>all,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">15.</note> that they which live, ſhould not hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth live unto themſelves; but unto him who died for them, and roſe again."</p>
            <p>"The next day John ſeeth Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus coming unto him, <note place="margin">John i. 29.</note> and ſaith, Behold the Lamb of God, who
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:026523_0098_0FD085EE48D3E728"/>
taketh away the <hi>ſin</hi> of the <hi>world.</hi>"</p>
            <p>"If any man ſin, we have an <hi>advocate</hi> with the Father; Jeſus Chriſt the righteous. <note place="margin">1 John ii, 1.</note> And he is the <hi>propitiation</hi> for our <hi>ſins,</hi> and not for <hi>ours only</hi>; but alſo for the <hi>ſins</hi> of the <hi>whole world.</hi>"</p>
            <p>"But we ſee Jeſus who was made a little lower than the angels; for the ſuffering of death, crowned with <hi>glory</hi> and honor, <note place="margin">Heb. ii. 9.</note> that he, by the grace of God, ſhould <hi>taſte death</hi> for <hi>every man.</hi>"</p>
            <p>"For it pleaſed the Father. <note place="margin">Col. i. 19.</note> that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell." And having made peace through the blood of his croſs, by him to <hi>reconcile all things</hi> unto himſelf; by him, I ſay, whether they be things on earth, or things in heaven. "If ye continue in the faith grounded and ſettled, and be not moved away from the hope of the goſpel, which ye have heard, and which was <hi>preached</hi> to <hi>every creature,</hi> which is <hi>under heaven</hi>; whereof, I Paul, am made a miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter." 23.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="unknown:026523_0099_0FD07E472F881B28"/>This laſt text ſtrongly corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, what St. Peter affirms, that the goſpel was preached to the <hi>dead,</hi> or <hi>ſpirits</hi> in <hi>priſon.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. iv. 5, 6.</note>
            </p>
            <p>"Who ſhall give account to him that is ready to judge the <hi>quick</hi> and the dead: for, for this cauſe was the goſpel preached <hi>alſo</hi> to them that <hi>are dead,</hi> that they might be judged according to men in the <hi>fleſh,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Pet. iv. 5.</note> but live according to God in the ſpirit." We are told in the preceding chapter; when, and by whom the goſpel was preached to the dead: "For Chriſt alſo hath once ſuffered for ſins; the juſt for the unjuſt, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the fleſh but quickened by the <hi>ſpirit</hi>;" By which alſo, he, to wit, Chriſt, went and preached unto the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in priſon: which, ſometime, (or formerly) were diſobedient, when once the long ſuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few; that is, eight ſouls, <note place="margin">iii. 18, 19, 20.</note> were ſaved by water."From what
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:026523_0100_0FD07E45AFB4EBD0"/>
has been obſerved, it is apparent, from ſcripture, and alſo ſupported by reaſon; that God <hi>willed</hi> that all men ſhould be <hi>ſaved</hi>; that Chriſt gave himſelf a <hi>ranſom</hi> for all, to be teſtified in due time, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be eſteemed criminal by many to mention it, leaſt it ſhould induce people to ſin! That by the offence of <hi>one,</hi> judgment came upon all men to condemnation, even ſo, by the righteouſneſs of <hi>one,</hi> the free gift came upon <hi>all men,</hi> unto the <hi>juſtification</hi> of <hi>life</hi>; that Chriſt is the <hi>propitiation</hi> for the ſins of the <hi>whole world</hi>; that he taſted death for <hi>every man</hi>; that it pleaſed God that in Chriſt ſhould all fulneſs dwell; thereby to enable him to <hi>reconcile all things</hi> unto himſelf, both in earth and heaven. Nor was this power given to Chriſt in vain; for we find him, both before and after his crucifixion, exerting theſe powers in the moſt diligent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable manner, for the <hi>reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>ſalvation</hi> of <hi>all mankind</hi>; firſt preaching the goſpel to the
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:026523_0101_0FD07E48AEF2AD40"/>
               <hi>living,</hi> until the time of his cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion: and immediately after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, to thoſe who died above two thouſand years before he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the fleſh: for St. Paul informs the Coloſſians, that the goſpel had been preached to every creature which is under heaven, which would have appeared very improbable, if St. Peter had not explained the matter, by informing us—<hi>when,</hi> by <hi>whom,</hi> and to <hi>whom</hi> the goſpel was preached; to wit, by Chriſt after his crucifixion, to the dead—the inhabitants of the old world, who had formerly been diſobedient in the days of Noah; that they might have the ſame advantages, and be judged accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſame rule or law, by which they were to be judged, who had heard the goſpel in the <hi>fleſh</hi> and might thereafter live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of God in the Spirit. Theſe poor meſerable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings had remained captives and thoſe priſoners in the pit, wherein is no water, near two thouſand
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:026523_0102_0FD085F08E38E268"/>
four hundred years, when the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of mankind entered the drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry manſions of miſery and woe, and preached to them the goſpel, or ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of great joy.—He probably told them that he was the high prieſt of the new covenant, who had lately made an ample atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the ſins of the whole world; that he was in poſſeſſion of the keys of hell and of death; that he came to break the gates of braſs, and cut the bars of iron aſunder; to open the priſon doors, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim liberty to the captives: for thus ſaith the Lord, even the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the mighty, ſhall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible ſhall be delivered. In what a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious light does the Saviour of all mankind appear, when his conduct and character is properly delineated, and well underſtood. In the hour of his crucifixion, when labouring under, the preſſure of the moſt ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, he prayed for his murderers, ſaying, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:026523_0103_0FD085CE0BDF65F0"/>
do. Actuated by the ſame bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent diſpoſition, he had no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er finiſhed the glorious work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, than he flew, an unem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied ſpirit, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and releaſe a world from miſery and woe; who had remained priſoners in the regions of darkneſs, for near two thouſand four hundred years. Whoever deems this a ſlight puniſhment, and affirms that the doctrine of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal reſtoration, affords great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to continue in ſin, when they can eſcape ſo eaſily— would probably alter their mind, before they had lain half that time in the pit, wherein is no water, and deem a never ending puniſhment rather too ſevere, and continued ſomething too long.</p>
            <p>Were the zealous John Lucius Calvinus himſelf to lay 200 years in a fire but half as hot as that in which he cauſed poor Servetus to be burned; and then be told, that vindictive juſtice could not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with any term ſhort of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:026523_0104_0FD085F207FC4FC0"/>
never ending puniſhment: for ſuch meaſure as he dealt out to others, ſuch he ſhould receive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf—he would moſt probably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that David was miſtaken, when he penned pſalm CXLV; where he ſays, "The Lord is good to <hi>all</hi>; and his <hi>tender mercies</hi> are <hi>over</hi> all his other works." And again, "Let Iſrael hope in the Lord: for with the Lord there is <hi>mercy,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal cxxx. 7.</note> and with him is plenteous <hi>redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>"</p>
            <p>"And he ſhall redeem Iſrael from all his iniquities." "O give thanks unto the Lord, <note place="margin">8.</note> for he is good: for his mercy endureth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever." Calvin would probably comment upon theſe paſſages of ſcripture, <note place="margin">Pſ. cvii. 1.</note> and ſay, How can it be affirmed, that God is <hi>good to all</hi>? and that his tender mercies are over all his other works? Am I not an individual, brought out of a ſtate of non-exiſtence, by the agency of the Deity? Am I not the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of his hands, who has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that he has made all things
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:026523_0105_0FD085CF8B306528"/>
for himſelf? Am I now to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my living a few years on earth as a bleſſing, where I ſinned and ſuffered many hardſhips? But is ſinning and ſuffering a few years on earth, ſuch a mighty privilege, as to be an ample compenſation for the endurance of never ending miſery? Are theſe conditions ſo, much preferable to a ſtate of non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtence, that I am bound to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it as a bleſſing, and return ſincere thanks to the Deity for his goodneſs to me, in forcing me into exiſtence, knowing infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly that I would be a ſinner, which he made uſe of no effectual means to prevent, although it was in his power; but rather choſe to leave me unaſſiſted; to the machina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Devil a few years; and then ſend <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> hell, to be torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the endleſs ages of eternity!</p>
            <p>If this be the caſe, —that the reign of mercy is to laſt 80 or 100 years, and the raging reign of vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive juſtice to laſt throughout the endleſs ages of eternity, —how
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:026523_0106_0FD085F416BC57D0"/>
can it be ſaid with truth, that "the tender mercies of the Lord are over all his other works?" Should it not rather be reverſed, and ſay, The mercies of the Lord are exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed towards the children of men a few days, months, or years; and the reign of vindictive juſtice to be continued throughout the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ages of eternity? If this be true, then revenge muſt be the darling attribute of the Deity, and preſide over all his other works.

all in unbelief,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. xi. 32.</note> that he might have <hi>mercy upon all.</hi>"</p>
            <p>By the firſt of theſe texts, it plainly appears; that Adam was the repreſentative of <hi>all his poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> or of human nature in general, in as much as judgment unto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation came upon <hi>all men</hi> for his offence; that Jeſus Chriſt, by aſſuming the human nature, became as fully and compleatly the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative of <hi>all mankind,</hi> as Adam was, or had been; and therefore, by his <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> the <hi>free gift came upon all men,</hi> unto <hi>juſtification</hi> of <hi>life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So you ſee, that St. Paul conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Chriſt as the compleat repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative and <hi>Saviour</hi> of <hi>all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind</hi>; who, by his righteouſneſs, had wrought out a compleat ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the <hi>whole human race,</hi> unto the <hi>juſtification</hi> of <hi>life</hi>; and if God <hi>juſtifieth,</hi> who is he that <hi>condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>?</p>
            <p>And further to eſtabliſh them in the belief of this glorious doctrine, he argues, that as God ſpared not
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:026523_0111_0FD085D40E8FFB48"/>
his own Son; but delivered him up for <hi>us all</hi>—he will, with him alſo, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

And to convince them that Chriſt was not that partial Saviour, which many conceive him to be, who would ſit down contentedly, with as many ſouls as the Devil pleaſed to give him. <note place="margin">Rom. xi. 32.</note> He tells the Romans, "That God had concluded <hi>them all in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief,</hi> that he might <hi>have mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all.</hi>"</p>
            <p>"For as in Adam <hi>all die,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. xxv. 22.</note> even ſo in Chriſt ſhall <hi>all be made alive.</hi>"</p>
            <p>"For the love of Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraineth us, becauſe we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: And that he <hi>died for all,</hi> that they which live, ſhould not henceforth, <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 14.</note> live unto themſelves, <note place="margin">15.</note> but unto him who died for them, and roſe again."</p>
            <p>"For to this end Chriſt both di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <note place="margin">Rom. xiv. 9.</note> and roſe and revived, that he might be Lord of both the <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>living.</hi>" If ſo, he muſt be <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Saint Paul calls Chriſt "The
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:026523_0112_0FD085F8D07EA418"/>
image of the inviſible God, <note place="margin">Col. i. 15.</note> the firſt born of every creature."</p>
            <p>"For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, <note place="margin">Col. i. 16.</note> and that are in earth, viſible and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; whether they be thrones or dominions, or principalities or powers; all things were created by <hi>him</hi> and <hi>for him.</hi>"</p>
            <p>If therefore Chriſt made all things for himſelf, he muſt deviate greatly from his original intention, before he gives up any thing to the Devil, eſpecially the ſouls which he has made for himſelf.</p>
            <p>"I exhort, <note place="margin">1 Tim. ii. 1</note> therefore, that firſt of all, ſupplications, prayers, interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and giving of thanks be made for <hi>all men.</hi>"</p>

And whatever the omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Jehovah <hi>wills</hi> to be done, he will certainly accompliſh. But the apoſtle, to ſhew that the ſalvation of <hi>all men,</hi> was not only poſſible; but eaſily practicable—he obſerves, that there is one God to be appeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who is a God of infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and mercy, who <hi>wills</hi> that <hi>all men</hi> may be <hi>ſaved,</hi> and one media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor between this <hi>gracious God</hi> and <hi>men</hi>; to wit, the man <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> who is the advocate and friend of mankind univerſally, as he has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given himſelf a ranſom; not for a few individuals, but for <hi>all mankind.</hi> And although this great and important truth, may not be generally known to the chief prieſts and Phariſees of our day, it ſhall
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:026523_0114_0FD085FA4B165D18"/>
nevertheleſs be teſtified in due time; to the honor of God, and the unſpeakable conſolation of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good being.</p>
            <p>If, therefore, the ſupreme <hi>God</hi> is ſo <hi>benevolent,</hi> as to will that all mankind ſhould be ſaved, and has ſent his Son, on purpoſe to be the <hi>Saviour</hi> of the <hi>world</hi>: and Chriſt has, on his part, given himſelf a <hi>ranſom</hi> for <hi>all</hi>—then <hi>all</hi> muſt be <hi>ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He who redeems or ranſoms captives, claims them as his own, and never leaves them in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the enemy.</p>
            <p>Can there be any thing more abſurd, than to ſuppoſe, that after Chriſt had given his life a ranſom for the whole world of mankind— that he ſhould, nevertheleſs, leave vaſt numbers of thoſe very beings, for whom he ſhed his precious blood, in the poſſeſſion of the Devil eternally?</p>
            <p>Chriſt is neither a partial Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, nor a partial conqueror; he will never ſubmit to the Devil,
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:026523_0115_0FD085D7097923F0"/>
and permit him to retain one hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſoul in captivity, which he made for himſelf: for certainly he was not ſo complaiſant as to make any ſouls, on purpoſe for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; and if the Devil ſhould even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually retain in <hi>captivity,</hi> any of the ſouls which Chriſt had made for himſelf, then is Chriſt defeated; and his deſigns fruſtrated. And to ſay, that Chriſt has made ſouls, which he neither wiſhed to be happy, nor intended to ſave from endleſs perdition, is blaſphemy.</p>
            <p>And I believe it would be thought much leſs derogatory to the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Deity, by every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced perſon, to ſuppoſe that he abandoned the creatures which he had made, to the permanent do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the Devil, through a want of wiſdom and power to reſcue them; than to affirm that he had a ſufficient degree of wiſdom and power to ſave them; but that it was more agreeable to his divine will, that they ſhould be eternally and irrecoverably miſerable. If
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:026523_0116_0FD085FBCA468610"/>
we ſuppoſe him to be infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent, but deficient in wiſdom and power, this would be a great misfortune, which every good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would deplore, and would wiſh to aſſiſt him: but, if on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he is ſuppoſed to be infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſe and powerful; but ſo <hi>male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent,</hi> as to ſpeak unoffending, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcious matter into exiſtence, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly knowing, that the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into which he brought it, was as much worſe than that in which he found it, as a ſtate of the moſt ſevere, eternal, never ending pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, is worſe than a ſtate of non-exiſtence, is horrid beyond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription—but ſo it is. The Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts having determined, that vaſt numbers of the human race muſt be eternally damned, rather than give up this darling tenet, they blaſpheme the moral character of the Deity, by affirming that he forces into exiſtence millions of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man beings, morally incapable of doing any good; but replete with the ſtrongeſt propenſities to do evil,
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:026523_0117_0FD085D88A94D4F0"/>
which can neither be <hi>restrained</hi> or <hi>eradicated,</hi> by any thing which they can do. In which condition they are excluded from the benefit of Chriſt's death and ſufferings, and left to ſin and ſuffer a few years on earth, and then ſentenced, by the judge of the whole earth, to ſuffer the moſt exquiſite torment, in hell flames, as long as God himſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts.</p>
            <p>When all this miſchief and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry might have been avoided, by omitting to create all ſuch beings, as the Deity <hi>foreknew</hi> would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely ſinful, and eternally miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; for nothing ſhort of <hi>infinite guilt,</hi> can render any being juſtly obnoxious to a never ending or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite puniſhment.</p>
            <p>"He that loveth not, <note place="margin">1 John iv. 8.</note> knoweth not God, for God is love."</p>
            <p>"Herein is love, <note place="margin">10.</note> not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and ſent his Son to be the <hi>propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> for our ſins."</p>
            <p>"And we have ſeen, and do teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify, that the Father ſent the Son to
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:026523_0118_0FD085FD4B406AB8"/>
be the <hi>Saviour of the world.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">14.</note>
            </p>
            <p>"For God ſent not his Son into the world, <note place="margin">John iii. 17.</note> to condemn the world; but that the <hi>world,</hi> through him might be ſaved." In the above cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed texts, it appears, that God is the moſt benevolent of all beings, his very eſſence is love; his benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence inſpired him to create us; he ſo loved the world, as to ſend his dearly beloved Son, to be a propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation for our ſins, and the Saviour of the world. It ſhould be the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of our teachers to exhibit the Deity in his true character, which is that of infinite love, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded benevolence to all created beings; he hates ſin, becauſe it has a natural and neceſſary tendency to create confuſion, miſery and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order; but Chriſt loved mankind and died for them, while they were yet in a ſtate of rebellion againſt him. <note place="margin">Rom. v. 6, 8.</note>
            </p>
            <p>We ſhould, therefore, love the Lord our God, with all our heart, ſoul, ſtrength, and mind. <note place="margin">18.</note> "There is no fear in love; but perfect love
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:026523_0119_0FD085DA0EB0D570"/>
caſteth out fear, becauſe fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love." If perfect love caſteth out fear, it is as certain, that the perfect fear and dread of a tyrant, muſt and will caſt out love.</p>
            <p>Therefore, people ſhould never be taught to believe that God is as much glorified and pleaſed with the death and eternal damnation of a ſinner, as in the ſalvation and eternal felicity of a ſaint. As it is not in the powers of imagination, to paint a tyrant in more infernal colours; it is a character which no being, except the prince of Devils, can poſſibly either love or imitate. And there can be no doubt, that the Devil is highly pleaſed with thoſe, who endeavour to perſuade their fellow beings, that partiality, cruelty and revenge, are the genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine attributes of the Deity: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is impoſſible, in the nature of things, that any wiſe and good being, ſhould ſerve a God, poſſeſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch attributes, through love;
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:026523_0120_0FD085FECEADFEE0"/>
which is the only motive that can render our ſervices acceptable to a God, whoſe very eſſence is <hi>love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as to the worſhip extorted, and rendered, through a ſlaviſh fear, it can only debaſe the mind and derange the underſtanding; but can never mend the heart.— And therefore, can never be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to that God, who requires us to <hi>love</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> our <hi>God,</hi> with all our heart, ſoul, ſtrength and mind, and our neighbours as ourſelves. We are alſo command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>love,</hi> our enemies, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give thoſe that treſpaſs againſt us. Now if God neither <hi>loved</hi> his <hi>ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi>; nor ever forgave all thoſe that treſpaſſed againſt him; but will torment millions of them, in everlaſting burnings, as long as he himſelf exiſts. Can it be poſſible that he expected, that we ſhould be more merciful and benevolent than himſelf, or recommended to us a line of conduct, more virtuous and godlike, than that which he prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed himſelf? But thanks be to
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:026523_0121_0FD085DB89AA5D80"/>
God, the fetters of ignorance and ſuperſtition are wearing out very faſt, and prejudice, that bitter ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to free enquiry, and the inveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation of truth, has loſt much of its power over the minds of great numbers of very ſenſible people; who begin to view the Deity, as a God of ſtrict impartial juſtice, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine love, infinite goodneſs, bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, truth and mercy, that has no pleaſure in the death and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal damnation of a ſinner; but would rather that he ſhould turn from the evil of his ways and live.</p>
            <p>If ſin and its conſequences be diſpleaſing to a God of infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, wiſdom, and power—is it not abſurd to ſuppoſe, that he will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to remain in being, to the endleſs ages of eternity? Are they of that indeſtructable nature, that the Deity cannot eradicate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them? If he can deſtroy them, why ſhould he permit them always to remain in being, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe him eternally?</p>
            <p>Are there ſome men, who are, by
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:026523_0122_0FD086004DA491A8"/>
nature, unconvertable; that infinite wiſdom and power are incapable of reforming? Does the Deity doom any ſouls to eternal miſery, but ſuch as he cannot ſave? Or, does he doom to eternal miſery, any ſouls, which he <hi>could,</hi> but <hi>would</hi> not ſave?</p>
            <p>If any ſouls are to be miſerable to the endleſs ages of eternity, I affirm, that they muſt belong to one of the above claſſes; to wit,</p>
            <p>Such as God <hi>could</hi> have <hi>ſaved,</hi> but <hi>would</hi> not: or ſuch as he <hi>would</hi> have <hi>ſaved,</hi> but <hi>could</hi> not. The firſt of theſe propoſitions denies God's infinite <hi>goodneſs,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be true.</p>
            <p>The ſecond denies his infinite <hi>power,</hi> which muſt be falſe.</p>
            <p>It is, therefore, falſe to ſay, that any of the ſouls which God has made, will be eternally and irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verably miſerable; becauſe Chriſt is both able and willing to ſave them all—who tells us, "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, I will draw <hi>all men unto me.</hi>" <note place="margin">John xii. 32.</note>

               <salute>MY DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHEN we had the laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, reſpecting the motives which induced the infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good and merciful God to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the human ſpecies: you alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he had done it to diſplay the glory of his divine attributes, to which opinion I cheerfully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. But the point in diſpute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, is,</p>
            <p>Whether theſe divine attributes are not diſplayed, in a more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, juſt and merciful manner, in the final ſalvation, and everlaſting happineſs of every human being, which God has created; than in the eternal damnation, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting miſery of any number of them? Therefore, to aſſiſt us in the
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:026523_0125_0FD085DFA7AACCE8"/>
inveſtigation of this important ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; we muſt have recourſe to the ſcriptures, and ſuch ſelf-evident principles and axioms, as the light of reaſon, and the nature of the ſubject will furniſh.</p>
            <p>The proper ſteps to be taken in this caſe is, to enquire,</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. What is God?</item>
               <item>II. What are his attributes?</item>
               <item>III. For whom, and for what end did he create us?</item>
            </list>
            <p>And, in the firſt place, I ſhall define God; whoſe very eſſence is love, "To be a ſpirit, infinite, eternal, and unchangeable in his being;" whoſe attributes are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite mercy, wiſdom, power, holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, juſtice, goodneſs and truth. The firſt propoſition to be proved, is, that God is love; which is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently apparent in his works of creation and providence; but point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly proved in John, "He that loveth not, knoweth not God, for <hi>God is love</hi>" <note place="margin">I John iv, 8, 16.</note> 
               <note place="margin">I John iv. 8.</note>
            </p>
            <p>"And we have known and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the <hi>love</hi> that God hath to
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:026523_0126_0FD086034ECBCFB0"/>
us. <note place="margin">16.</note> 
               <hi>God</hi> is <hi>love</hi>; and he that dwelleth in <hi>love,</hi> dwelleth in God, and God in him. <note place="margin">1 John 9. 10.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In this was manifeſted the <hi>love</hi> of God, towards us, becauſe that God hath ſent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. <note place="margin">1 John ii. 1.</note> Herein is <hi>love,</hi> not that we loved God; but that he <hi>loved</hi> us, and ſent his Son to be the propitiation for our ſins: but leaſt it ſhould be ſaid, that he is the propitiation, for the ſins of the few that are ſuppoſed to be elected only; I ſhall quote, "And if any man ſin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous."</p>
            <p>"And he is the propitiation for our ſins; and not for ours only, but alſo for the <hi>ſins</hi> of the <hi>whole world.</hi>"</p>
            <p>Preſuming that enough has been ſaid on this head, to prove the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial <hi>love</hi> of the Deity to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: and alſo, that the enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the attributes of the Deity, will not be diſputed. I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:026523_0127_0FD085E0CC299620"/>
in the third place, to prove, that God made all the ſouls of mankind for himſelf; with the moſt expreſs and benevolent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, to make them all eventually happy, in praiſing and glorifying his holy name, for his infinite <hi>love</hi> and kindneſs towards them, and to enjoy the manifeſtations of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded goodneſs forever.</p>
            <p>Every ſoul, created by the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, muſt be <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>innocent,</hi> and as ſuch, he muſt <hi>love</hi> it, and wiſh a continuation of its happineſs: but if he foreknew, (as the Calviniſts ſuppoſe) that it would be eternally miſerable, if it remained in exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he, as a merciful being, would blot it out of exiſtence again, while in a ſtate of innocence. But as it is univerſally allowed amongſt chriſtians, that there are but two places of permanent reſidence, for departed ſouls after this life; to wit, heaven and hell; and but two beings who are to divide the ſouls of the human ſpecies between them; to wit, God and the Devil:
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:026523_0128_0FD086059E5FA280"/>
we muſt endeavour, by a careful inveſtigation of their different powers and attributes, to judge of their final ſucceſs, with reſpect to their efforts to gain ſubjects, and depopulate each others kingdoms; and to enable us to do this, let us eſtabliſh a few ſelf-evident propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, as axioms.</p>
            <p>It is the excluſive prerogative of the Deity to create ſouls.</p>
            <p>No other being can create them.</p>
            <p>Therefore he has created all the ſouls that ever have exiſted.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. When, he created them, he either intended that they ſhould be eternally miſerable: Or,</item>
               <item>II He did not care what became of them: Or,</item>
               <item>III. He wiſhed, and deſigned, that they ſhould be eventually happy.</item>
            </list>
            <p>To affirm the firſt, is blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.</p>
            <p>The ſecond, impiouſly abſurd.</p>
            <p>Therefore, the third muſt be true.</p>
            <p>God is infinitely <hi>benevolent, wiſe</hi>
               <pb n="112" facs="unknown:026523_0129_0FD085E24E498438"/>
and <hi>powerful</hi>: therefore, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely benevolent, he wiſhed and deſigned, that all the ſouls which he made, might be eventually hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.</p>
            <p>Being infinitely wiſe, he has cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly concerted his plan, ſo as not to be fruſtrated, in the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his gracious deſign.</p>
            <p>And being infinitely powerful, no combination of finite powers, can ever amount to infinite; and if ſtill finite, they muſt ultimately fail in the attempt, to counteract and fruſtrate the operations and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of an omnipotent God; who will make a moſt <hi>glorious</hi> diſplay of his divine attributes, in vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the powers of death and hell, and releaſing every captive and priſoner out of the pit, wherein is no water.</p>
            <p>Is it not amazingly abſurd, to ſuppoſe, that a God of infinite goodneſs, juſtice and mercy, has created millions of human beings, on purpoſe for the Devil, to be his captives and priſoners, to the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:026523_0130_0FD086070991D828"/>
ages of eternity? But is it not more abſurd, if poſſible, to ſuppoſe, that the Deity made them for himſelf, with the benevolent deſign of rendering them eternally hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, in praiſing and adoring his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly name, for his infinite <hi>love</hi> and goodneſs towards them; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his gracious deſigns, that millions of theſe very beings, are to be, and remain in the poſſeſſion and under the powers of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, to be tormented by him, to the endleſs ages of eternity?</p>
            <p>If ſuch an event ſhould finally take place, then it is certain, that finite folly, weakneſs, and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, can overpower, baffle, fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate and defeat, the benevolent deſigns and operations, of infinite goodneſs, wiſdom, and almighty power, and triumph over omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
            <p>If any individual of the human race is to be miſerable, as long as God himſelf exiſts; it muſt happen through a defeat of benevolence, wiſdom or power in the Deity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="unknown:026523_0131_0FD085E3D18AA960"/>Therefore, the predeſtinarians deny God's infinite <hi>goodneſs,</hi> when they maintain, that God <hi>could,</hi> but <hi>would</hi> not convert all his creatures. The Socinians deny his infinite <hi>power,</hi> when they maintain, that he <hi>would</hi> but <hi>cannot</hi> convert them; and will be obliged one day to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilate all reprobate ſpirits! The premiſes being abſurd, an abſurd concluſion is to be expected.</p>
            <p>The Univerſaliſts affirm, that it is incompatible with the divine love, infinite juſtice and mercy of the Deity, to create human beings, knowing that the condition into which he brought them, would be as much worſe than that in which they were—as a ſtate of eternal, never ending miſery, under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite diſpleaſure of an offended God, is worſe than a ſtate of non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtence, in which condition they could neither offend the Deity, nor ſuffer any inconvenience whatever.</p>
            <p>They, therefore, believe that the Deity created the whole human race, with a poſitive determination
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:026523_0132_0FD086088B543CF0"/>
to make the condition, into which he brought them, vaſtly preferable to a ſtate of non-exiſtence: and that it would be an unprovoked act of cruelty to make it <hi>worſe</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the materials of which the future being was to conſiſt, could not offend him, before it exiſted as a moral accountable agent, capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of diſtinguiſhing between good and evil, with a free will to chooſe, and a power of action, to do either good or evil, agreeable to the free choice of the will. If, therefore, the Deity foreknew, that any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which he might create, would, by making an improper uſe of its free agency, become eternally and irrecoverably miſerable, he cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly never would force it into exiſtence, which would be a ſevere unmerited puniſhment inflicted, prior to the poſſibility of offence, or tranſgreſſion on the part of the being puniſhed.</p>
            <p>To ſay, that the infinitely graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and merciful Deity's foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that a certain individual non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entity,
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:026523_0133_0FD085E54C4A3D80"/>
would, if <hi>created,</hi> make an improper uſe of its free agency, and become an incorrigible ſinner, had provoked him to drag it into exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to puniſh it eternally; not for any evil it had done—but for what he foreknew it would do—is charging him with making an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely cruel, and improper uſe of his own free agency: not only to do evil, that good might come, but doing evil of the moſt barbarous kind, for the ſake of evil, from which no good could poſſibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult—which is impoſſible.</p>
            <p>This is not only charging God fooliſhly; but wickedly. If the Devil is not extremely ungrateful indeed, he muſt have precious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in ſtore, for thoſe who uſe, every poſſible means in their power, to perſuade people that the Deity is the the greateſt tyrant of the two. But the God of juſtice, love, and mercy, knowing what pains would be taken to traduce his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral character, directed the prophet Ezekiel to record the following
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:026523_0134_0FD0860A2DDB5588"/>
oath; to wit, "As I live, ſaith the Lord God, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way, and live." If we believe what the Deity has ſworn in this caſe; we muſt diſbelieve that he has ever created one ſoul, knowing that it would be ſo obſtinately and perſeveringly wicked; that infinite wiſdom goodneſs and almighty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er could not reform and reclaim it. If it be ſaid, that the Deity could not ſave it, conſiſtently with the plan he had choſen: I anſwer; that the plan could not have been the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of infinite wiſdom, which prevented the Deity from accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing his original deſign; which muſt have been to make every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which he created, eventually happy.</p>
            <p>To affirm that an human being, in a ſtate of extreme, eternal, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ending miſery, is as happy as the Deity intended or deſigned he ſhould ever be, at the time he cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated him—is blaſphemy. If God
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:026523_0135_0FD085E7DA269868"/>
intended that all the ſouls which he created, ſhould be eventually hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and gave them exiſtence, as a poſitive bleſſing, and not as a curſe: and not with ſtanding many millions are ſuppoſed to reſiſt the benevolent deſigns of the Deity, and baſſle all the means that could be employed by the Deity, for their converſion. The queſtion na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally recurs;</p>
            <p>How can it be poſſible, that finite folly, weakneſs and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhould eternally overpower, baffle, fruſtrate and defeat the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and operations of the divine love, infinite wiſdom, goodneſs and almighty power? But the Calvin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, to juſtify the meaſure of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting an infinite, eternal, never ending puniſhment, for temporary crimes, committed, in time, by finite beings, have laboured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade us, that every ſin is an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite evil, becauſe it is committed againſt an infinite being: thence it follows, that if one ſin be an infinite evil, two ſins are dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:026523_0136_0FD0860B867A0138"/>
infinite, and three, trebly infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite—which, at beſt, is egregious nonſenſe, as infinity admits of no addition: and therefore, if any one ſin be an infinite evil, it deſtroys all degrees of compariſon between crimes, and renders the boy, who takes an apple out of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's orchard, as criminal as the Jews, who murdered the Saviour of the world. As there can be no difference, in degree, between things that are infinite; it is, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, demonſtrably evident. that no being, who is not poſſeſſed of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite power, can do or perform, any infinite action, either good or bad; therefore, the plea, in juſtification of inflicting infinite puniſhments on human beings, to ſatisfy divine juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, for the commiſſion of crimes, ſuppoſed to be infinite—muſt fall to the ground. A perſon would naturally conclude, on being told, that ſinners were to be puniſhed in hell, to ſatisfy divine juſtice, that there might be a time, at ſome future period, when juſtice might
<pb n="120"
                   facs="unknown:026523_0137_0FD085E9112A41B0"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
be ſatisfied, and the ſinners releaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but they tell us, that juſtice is vindictive; that is, ſo <hi>revengeful, malicious</hi> and <hi>ſpiteful,</hi> that it never can be ſatisfied: and therefore, in this undertaking, as in all the reſt, the means are ſtill inadequate to the end; and although good might have been intended, the final con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is always evil. Yet the Calviniſts tell us, it is by this inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent ſyſtem of their own fabrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the Deity is to diſplay the <hi>glory</hi> of his divine attributes to all intelligent beings.</p>
            <p>The chief objection which the calviniſts oppoſe, to the doctrine of the univerſal reſtoration, is, that it has a tendency to make people remiſs in making their calling and election ſure, in this life: in which caſe, they may be eternally miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hereafter—owing to their own neglect: but how inconſiſtent this objection is, with the doctrine of election and reprobation, any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of common underſtanding may very eaſily perceive. For a Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſt
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:026523_0138_0FD0860DF3C03AE0"/>
to admoniſh a reprobate, to work out his own ſalvation, with fear and trembling; to make his calling and election ſure—and to make his peace with that God, who had conſigned him to endleſs perdition, by an unchangeable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, many ages prior to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence; is, of all things, the moſt abſurd. But others being ſhocked at the horrid imputation, that God ſhould create human beings, having conſigned them to eternal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by an unalterable decree, prior to a poſſibility of their hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offended him—deny that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed their eternal miſery; but ſtill affirm that the Deity infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly knew, that they would be ſo, to the endleſs ages of eternity.—Whatever God infallibly foreknew, muſt as certainly come to paſs, as if he had decreed it: ſo that this miſerable <hi>ſhift</hi> will neither <hi>vindicate</hi> the character of the Deity, from being guilty of an <hi>unprovoked act</hi> of <hi>cruelty,</hi> in creating beings, who had never <hi>offended</hi> him, infallibly
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:026523_0139_0FD085EA89E66898"/>
knowing that they would be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally miſerable: neither does it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fate of the poor unhappy creature.</p>
            <p>For if God infallibly knew, that any individual would be eternally miſerable; it is clearly impoſſible that he ſhould eſcape. And the concluſion, from theſe premiſes, muſt be, that the Deity has dragged him into exiſtence, before he had <hi>offended,</hi> on purpoſe that he ſhould be eternally damned: for it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to ſuppoſe, that God would ſeriouſly uſe any means to ſave a being, whom he infallibly knew would be eternally miſerable. So that the unhappy creature is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be deſerted by the God that made him; and abandoned to the entire conduct of the Devil. Therefore, if we admit that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity is either juſt or merciful, we muſt, in conſequence, diſbelieve, that he ever either <hi>decreed</hi> or <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knew,</hi> that any ſoul, which he cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, would be miſereble to the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ages of eternity, and believe
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:026523_0140_0FD0860F5580AB50"/>
that he has benevolence, wiſdom and power ſufficient to ſave them all, otherwiſe he never would have created them. "The Father lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Son, and bath given <hi>all things</hi> into his hand." "All that the Father giveth me, <note place="margin">John iii. 35. vi 37.</note> ſhall come to me; and him that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out."</p>
            <p>"And this is the Father's <hi>will,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">39.</note> who hath ſent me, that of all which he hath given me, I ſhould loſe nothing, but ſhould raiſe it up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain at the laſt day."</p>
            <p>If the Father hath given all things into the bands of the Son; and all which the Father hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, ſhall come to him—then all muſt come; and he declares he will in no wiſe caſt them out.</p>
            <p>"And I, <note place="margin">xii. 32.</note> if I be lifted up from the earth, I will draw <hi>all men</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me."</p>
            <p>Chriſt has been lifted up from the earth, firſt on the croſs, and then to heaven; and as I repoſe entire confidence in what Chriſt has promiſed in ſuch plain terms;
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:026523_0141_0FD085EC1A10BAC0"/>
I ſincerely believe, that he will finally draw <hi>all men</hi> unto him; even thoſe who have made it the buſineſs of their whole lives; to traduce his moral character: for if he forgave the Jews who murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, <note place="margin">Rom. xi. 26.</note> he will doubtleſs pray for his defamers, ſaying "Father for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them: for they know not what they do." "And ſo all Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el ſhall be ſaved; as it is written, there ſhall come out of Sion, the deliverer, and turn away ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from Jacob."</p>
