            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THis excellent Sermon comes to you upon the moſt important Errand that can poſſibly be, even to perſwade you to embrace the great Salvation offered to you in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, by a glorious Redeemer: One would think few Arguments might perſwade Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to embrace a Bleſſing ſo much to their Pleaſure, Profit and Advantage; but ſad it is to ſee that the moſt inexpreſſibly glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Things of the heavenly World are ſo ſlighted, neglected and deſpiſed by almoſt all the ſinful Race of fallen apoſtate Man: And how much more ſtrange that ſo many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments muſt be uſed and that to ſo little Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, to perſwade Men to accept of ſuch glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Things as in the Word of God we are aſſured are prepared for, and ſhall certainly be given to the Embracers of this great Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. The Author who is now reaping the happy Fruits and Effects thereof, and beholding and enjoying the Bleſſings that doth accompany the ſame, has ſo ſweetly and earneſtly perſwaded to the Embracement thereof, that I ſhall ſay no more, but look up to the God of all Grace for his Bleſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the delightful, awakening, Soul comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſcourſe,</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE are two great and moſt ordinary Complaints in theſe days. 1. There are many who complain, that their Eſtates and Perſons are in Bondage, and that they are ſold for ſlaves to the Hands of Strangers: But, O that we could alſo turn over the Complaint to this, that our Souls are in Bondage, and that we are yet <hi>in the Gall of Bitterneſs, and in the Bond of Iniquity,</hi> that ſo we might be provoked
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:003424_0004_0FF83C404CADDD68"/>
to long for the great Salvation that is in our Offer. 2. There are many complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (and not without much cauſe) that there is now ſuch a toleration of Errors: But O wilt thou complain alſo of this, that within thy Heart there is a Tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Luſts; is there not an Act of Tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration concluded within thy Breaſt, that the Devil and all his Company may reign in thee at Pleaſure: Oh have ye not need of the great Salvation? Shall I tell you, that Chriſt is courting you to embrace it, and that he putteth all his moſt glorious Robes upon you, and manifeſteth himſelf unto you, as a Suiter making offer of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and of his great Salvation O tell me, Have ye ſeen him? Or do ye think to ſee him this Day? What Robes had he on? There are five glorious Robes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he cloaths himſelf when he conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendeth to manifeſt himſelf to his people. Firſt he cometh to his own with the <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Salvation,</hi> according to that Word, Zech. 9.9. <hi>Rejoice O Daughter of Sion greatly, ſhout O Daughter of Jeruſalem:</hi> for <hi>behold, thy King cometh unto thee, he is juſt, and having Salvation</hi>; ay, your King is come here to day, and will ye not fall in love with him when he is cloathed with the Garments of Salvation, can ye e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have a more conquering Sight of Chriſt, then when he is cloathed with ſuch an excellent Robe, and offering you Salvation.
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003424_0005_0FF83C41D829A758"/>
Secondly, He appeareth to his own <hi>in Garments died in Blood,</hi> according to that Word, Iſai. 63.1, 2. <hi>Who is this that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up from Edom with <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ed Garments in Blood, as one that treadeth the Wine fat.</hi> And now I ſay to thee that will not look to Chriſt, when he appears in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Salvation, have ye a Heart to refuſe him that hath fought ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate for you, who <hi>hath trod the Wine-Preſs alone,</hi> and hath ſtained all his Garments with the Blood of thy Enemies; or is there any here who dare refuſe his Salva<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion, when they ſee how <hi>he treadeth his Enemies in Anger, and trampleth them in Fury,</hi> and thus <hi>ſprinkleth their Blood upon his Garments.</hi> O tremble at this Sight, and ſeek Quarter from him in time, or he ſhall dy his Garments with the Blood of thy immortal Soul. Thirdly, Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth unto his own, being cloathed with theſe humble Robes of Condeſcendency, when he came in <hi>the ſimilitude of ſinful Fleſh</hi>: O what a Sight was that, to behold the Prince of Heaven cloathed with our Nature; What a Sight was that to behold him that was <hi>cloathed with Light as with a Garment,</hi> to be cloathed with <hi>our Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,</hi> yet he condeſcended to cloath him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thus, that we might have acceſs unto him, and be partakers of his Gifts: O can we refuſe him, when love hath thus preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to put on the beggarly Weed that <hi>he might say to Worms, ye are my Brethren
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003424_0006_0FF83C4394EDC5D8"/>
and my Siſters.</hi> Fourthly, Chriſt ſometimes manifeſteth himſelf, being cloathed with the Garments of Beauty, &amp; raviſhing Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; ſuch was the Sight that the Spouſe got of Chriſt, Cant. 2.3. <hi>As the Apple tree among the Trees of the Wood, ſo is my Beloved among the Sons.</hi> And 5.10. when ſhe ſaw him, <hi>White and rudy, and the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard-bearer of ten thouſand,</hi> and when ſuch was the joyful Sight of him, when his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were as Light, <hi>and white as the Snow,</hi> which he had at the Transfigurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when theſe glorified ones did come (as it were) Ambaſſadors from that high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Houſe to make him a Viſit. And fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Chriſt he ſometimes appeareth to his own in Robes of dreadful Majeſty, and terrible Highneſs and Loftineſs, when the Soul upon the firſt Sight of him remains dead, and there remains no more Life in them: Such was the Sight <hi>Daniel</hi> got in his 10. Chapter. And ſuch was the Sight that <hi>John</hi> got of Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.17. And I would ask at all that are here, what a Sight have ye gotten of Chriſt to day, in which of all theſe Robes have ye ſeen him: It is true, we are not now to look for the extraordinary Sights of him; but yet if ever thou haſt ſeen him in any of his woing Robes, ſurely he hath appeared Matchleſs, and how ſhall ye then refuſe him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:003424_0007_0FF83C464B7096C0"/>But now to come to the Words I was ſpeaking unto you of; The firſt thing in the Words, viz.</p>
            <q>That there are many who live under the Offer of this great Salvation that do ſlight it, and do not embrace it.</q>
            <p>And now, I ſhall only add a few things further unto you.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let me propoſe a few Conſiderations to <hi>perſwade you to embrace the great Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> God forbid we go away before we embrace this Goſpel-Salvation: And therefore, I charge you in his Name, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> not away before ye embrace it. And <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> preſs it home upon you, there are th<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> eight or nine Properties of this great Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that is offered unto you this Day.</p>
            <p>And firſt, <hi>It is a free Salvation,</hi> ye have no more ado, but to put forth your Hand and take it: O come and take it: Chriſt hath fought for this Salvation, and there is no more required of you, but to come and reap the Fruits of his Victory: <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will let him come,</hi> there is nothing that ſhould move you to ſtay away, <hi>O Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, Bond ſlaves to Satan, O Priſoners of Hope,</hi> will ye come and partake of the great Salvation, what holds you from coming away and partaking of it, it is free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offered unto you: ay, believe it, Chriſt requires no more of you, but that ye ſhould come and take it out of his Hand; <hi>if ye conſent to obey,</hi> the Bargain is ended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Ye ſhall eat the good of the Land,</hi> Iſai. 1.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:003424_0008_0FF83C47D510D280"/>Secondly, This great Salvation, <hi>is a compleat Salvation,</hi> that is offered unto you to day; this is clear, Luke 1. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>1. <hi>That we might be ſaved from our Enemies, and from the Hand of all that hate us.</hi> There is not any Enemy that is in thy Way, but if thou will come and partake of the great Salvation, thou may have Victory over it, ſo compleat a Salvation is it that is in your Offer this Day. O ſhall we paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and not embrace it: O ſhall our curſed Hearts undervalue <hi>compleat at Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> that is come to your Door, believe <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Salvation is near unto you,</hi> if ye will take <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is a <hi>wonderful Salvation,</hi> it is ſuch a Salvation as to pry into it, and it is ſuch a Salvation that all the Prophets deſired to pry into it; It is almoſt ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Years ſince all the Angels in Heaven fell into a Sea of Wonder at this great Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: It is almoſt ſix thouſand Years ſince <hi>Abel</hi> fell into a Sea of Wonder at this great Salvation: And what think ye is his Exerciſe this Day? He is even won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering at this great Salvation: Would ye ask at all the Angels in Heaven, would they not all ſay, O embrace the great Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? Would ye ask at all the Saints that are above, would they not adviſe you to embrace the great Salvation? Would ye ask at <hi>Adam,</hi> would he not ſay, O em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the great Salvation? Could ye ask at <hi>Abel,</hi> Would he not ſay, O embrace
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:003424_0009_0FF83C4A12EC21A8"/>
the great Salvation? And would not all the Patriarchs ſay unto you, O embrace the great Salvation? And do not all that have taſted of the Sweetneſs of it, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> out unto you, Come and embrace the great Salvation.</p>
            <p>The fourth Property of his Salvation is, that it was bought at an exceeding dear Rate, <hi>it is a dear Salvation.</hi> Would ye know the Difference between Chriſt's coming to this Salvation, and your coming to it, it is this: Chriſt was forced to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel through all the Armies of the Juſtice of God: He was forced to drink of the Cup of the Wrath of God, before he could come to purchaſe this great Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and now what is required of you to obtain this, we may ſay no more, but put out your Hands and take it: Will ye look to the Price that was laid down for this Salvation, there is not a Wound in the Body of Chriſt, but it is ſaid, <hi>This is a dear Salvation.</hi> There is not a Reproach Chriſt met with, but it ſaith, <hi>O is not this a dear Salvation!</hi> There is not a buffeting Chriſt met with, but it ſaith, <hi>O is not this a dear Salvation</hi>! There is not a Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that he was put into, but it ſaith, <hi>Is not this a great and dear Salvation</hi>? O Sirs, will ye not come and take this great Salvation, this dear Salvation. What muſt I give for it ſay ye? I ſay, ye muſt give nothing for it, come and take it <hi>without Money, and without Price</hi>; it was dear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003424_0010_0FF83C4C512AB6E0"/>
Chriſt, but it ſhall be cheap unto you. O is it not cheap to you, I aſſure you, if ye will come to the Market to buy the great Salvation, there is none of you that needeth to ſtand for the Price of it. O come and take, and have it, and there ſhall be no more prigging.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, It is <hi>an everlaſting Salvation,</hi> that ye ſhall enjoy the Fruits of through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Eternity, as is clear, Heb. 9.13. <hi>He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Author of eternal Redemption unto us.</hi> It is a Salvation that the Devil can never be able to take out of your Hand, if ye take it, ye ſhall never be robbed of it again. O come and partake of this great Salvation, whereby the Gates of Hell ſhall never prevail againſt you.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, It is <hi>a noble and honourable Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> it is not to be taken out of one Slavery to another, but it is to be taken <hi>out of Priſon that we may reign: Luke</hi> 1.71. compared with Verſe 74. it is <hi>That we being ſaved, may ſerve him without Fear in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs, all the Days of our Life.</hi> I ſay, Come, come, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of this great Salvation, that your Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry may be increaſed, and that ye may be exalted above the Kings of the Earth.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, It is a <hi>moſt advantageous Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> What are the Advantages of any Salvation that are not to be found in this? Is there not Peace to be found through this Salvation? Is there not Liberty to be found through this Salvation? Is there
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003424_0011_0FF83C4EEA2CF388"/>
not eternal Enjoyment of God to be found in this Salvation? Yea, all Salvations are in this one Salvation.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, It is <hi>a royal Salvation,</hi> for it cometh to us from and through the Son of God. Chriſt is the Author of it, and we conceive, Chriſt may be ſaid to be the Author of this Salvation, in theſe Reſpects, 1. He is the meritorious Cauſe that did procure it, it was the Price of his Blood that was laid down for to purchaſe this great Salvation. 2. He is the Fountain from whence it floweth, according to that Word which we have cited, Heb. 5.9. <hi>He is the Author of eternal Salvation.</hi> 3. He is the Perſon that fitteth our Spirits for partaking of it, and it is he that removeth Mountains out of the Way, that we may have fair Acceſs unto the great Salvation. 4. It is he that muſt perſwade our Hearts to embrace and to take hold of it. He ſtandeth without, and cryeth in to the Heart, to embrace the great Salvation; And he ſtandeth within, making the Heart cry out; <hi>Content,</hi> I will embrace the great Salvation: He is indeed the Perſon that commendeth, and doth point forth this great Salvation unto us, he is the noble Miniſter of it, it began firſt to be preached by him.</p>
            <p>Now, Is there any of you that have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len in love with the great Salvation? That ye may try your ſelves, I ſhall give you ſome Evidences of the Perſons that are
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003424_0012_0FF83C51CD1E8540"/>
near unto this great Salvation, 1. Is thy Eſtimation of the great Salvation increaſed, beyond what it was in the morning when thou came hither? Is thy Eſtimation of the great Goſpel-Salvation a Foot higher than it was in the morning, I ſay unto thee, thou art not far from the great Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: Come away. 2. Is thy deſire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the great Salvation increaſed beyond what it was in the morning? Haſt thou ſtronger Deſires after the great Salvation than before thou came hither? That is an Evidence thou art not far from it. 3. Is <hi>thy Thoughts of thy Neceſſity</hi> of the great Salvation greater than they were? Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou that thou haſt more need of the great Salvation than ever thou thoughteſt before. And is thy Opinion and Thoughts of ſaving thy ſelf leſs than they were before thou cameſt hither? Art thou forced to cry out, <hi>None but Chriſt can ſave me</hi>? I ſay thou art not far from the great Salvation, Will thou come away? O that ye would once ſeal this Concluſion with much Heart-Perſwaſion, <hi>I am undone without Chriſt, I am undone without Chriſt,</hi> who is the Author of the great Salvation: Are there any of you that are ſenſible that ye are in the Fetters of Sin, and in the Bonds of Iniquity? Are ye brought to the Conviction of this, that ye are in the Gall of Bitterneſs? I ſay, if thou be brought to this Length, to be ſenſible of thy Bonds, and art crying out, <hi>O Redeemer, haſten and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:003424_0013_0FF83C5357F88D08"/>
come away!</hi> I ſay, if thou be ſenſible of thy Bonds and Impriſonment, and crying out, <hi>O thou that was anointed from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to proclaim Liberty to the Captives, and the opening of the Priſon to them that are bound.</hi> O haſten and come away, and redeem me, <hi>even poor me,</hi> ſinking, ſinning, periſhing, ſelf-deſtroying <hi>me,</hi> thou art not far from the great Salvation. 4. Art thou a Perſon who beginneth to weep becauſe thou haſt been ſo long a Stranger to Chriſt, and the great Salvation? Old Men that are here, how long have ye been Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the great Salvation, and to the Author of it? Now will ye ſhed one Tear for your Eſtrangement, and cry out, Wo is me that Chriſt and I have been ſo long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder? I ſay, if thou haſt: come to that Length, thou art not far from the great Salvation, <hi>Come away</hi>: O pity your ſelves, make haſte and come away.</p>
            <p>But now in the third Place, Let me give you ſome Evidences by which ye may know more clearly whether or no ye have embraced <hi>this great Salvation,</hi> that ye may know your ſelves, and that ye walk not down to the Grave with a Lie in your right hand. The firſt Evidence of a Perſon that hath embraced the great Salvation, is, that he will have a high E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of the Saviour and Author of the great Salvation: Haſt thou a matchleſs Eſteem of matchleſs Chriſt the Saviour of the World, that is a ſpeaking Evidence
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:003424_0014_0FF83C54E39DD028"/>
unto thee, thou art a Partaker of the great Salvation: Art thou come to this Length that thou crieſt out, <hi>None but Chriſt, None but Chriſt</hi>? It is a ſpeaking Evidence that thou art come to be a Partaker of the great Salvation, when thou can cry out th<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> Word, Exod. 15.2. <hi>The Lord is my Strength and my Song, he alone is become my Salvation.</hi> If Chriſt hath become thy Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation then it is like he hath become thy Song. I would ask this of you, were ye ever brought this Length, that ye durſt not adventure to praiſe Chriſt alone, but was forced to call in all the Creatures, and ſay, <hi>O magnify the Lord with me,</hi> O that is an Evidence that ye have embraced his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Thoſe who have embraced the great Salvation will ſtudy to maintain and keep their Hold of it, they will ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to hold faſt ſo precious a Jewel, this is preſs'd, Gal. 5.1. <hi>Stand faſt in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty wherewith Chriſt hath made us free.</hi> Yea, they will ſtudy to walk ſuitably to to this noble Mercy, at leaſt they will ſtrive and endeavour to do it, as is alſo preſs'd in that ſame Verſe. I ſay, if thou haſt been made a Partaker of the Goſpel of Salvation, thou wilt ſtrive to keep thy ſelf from the Power of theſe Things that once triumphed over thee.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, A Perſon that is a Partaker of the great Salvation will have a high E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of this Mercy and Salvation; ſo
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003424_0015_0FF83C56F0571770"/>
               <hi>Paul</hi> when he ſpeaketh of it here, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but put ſome Note of Excellency to it, calling it, <hi>the great Salvation.</hi> Therefore, I ſay, if thou haſt embraced the great Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, thou wilt have ſo high Eſteem of it, not to be ſubjected to it as thou ſhould, or to be in Subjection to the Power of thy Luſt in any Meaſure, will be his Burden and Affliction; the Man will be ſorry when he is brought forth from the Houſe of his Bondage, unto the Red-Sea; he will be ſorry, that when he ſhould have Songs of Triumph over his Idols put into his Mouth, that they ſhould ſing Songs of Triumph over him.</p>
            <p>Fourthly. A Perſon that hath embraced the great Salvation, he will be longing ſometimes for the Day when this Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhall be compleat, when he ſhall ſing that Song, with that <hi>numberous Multitude which cannot be numbered,</hi> Rev. 7.9. O what a Day ſhall it be, when thou ſhall begin to ſing that Song: <hi>After this</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I beheld, and lo, a great Multitude of all People, which no Man could number, of all People, Nations and Languages ſtood before the Throne, and before the Lamb, cloathed with white Robes, and Palms in their Hands, and they cryed</hi>; and how cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they? <hi>They cryed with a loud Voice:</hi> they would not mutter the Song, nor ſing ſilently, but <hi>cryed with a loud Voice:</hi> and what did they cry? they cryed with a loud Voice, <hi>Salvation unto our God, who
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:003424_0016_0FF83C5A1B082A80"/>
ſitteth upon the Throne, and to the Lamb.</hi> I would only ask at you that are Partak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the great Salvation, What Songs ſhall be put into thy Mouth, when the Waters of <hi>Jordan</hi> ſhall divide themſelves, <hi>that the ranſomed of the Lord might paſs thorow</hi>? when thou ſhall ſing that Song, Pſal. 115.1. <hi>Not unto us, not unto us, but unto thee belongeth the Glory of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> O what a Day ſhall that be, when that excellent Song ſhall be put in thy Mouth; yea, what a Day ſhall it be, when thou ſhalt be cloathed with theſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Garments that are made mention of, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 6.10. for he hath cloathed thee with the <hi>Garments of Salvation,</hi> and he hath covered thee with the <hi>Robe of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> O what Robes are theſe? Did ye ever ſee ſuch excellent Robes as theſe muſt be? I think we ſhall not know our ſelves; O do you not think we ſhall not know our ſelves, when we ſhall put on theſe excellent Robes? Now therefore, is the Bargain cloſed; or will ye go away before ye take this great Salvation? Dare ye go out at theſe Doors and neglect the great Salvation? I would ask this of you, Think ye it will not be moſt ſad, that Chriſt ſhould tell this in Heaven of you to night, I was preached to a pack of Stones, that none of them would love me? Will ye not be afraid that this Report ſhall be carried back to Heaven of you? For what Report can Chriſt carry back
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:003424_0017_0FF83C5BA4AF9DE8"/>
but this? Now is the Cord of this great Salvation let down unto you, is there none of you that will take a hold of it, O will ye ſeek after it, will ye make this a rejoycing Day in Heaven, that is a faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Day unto you, and the Way to make it ſo, is to embrace the great Salvation. Now what ſay ye to it old Men? Let me ſpeak to you, and ask your Thoughts of the great Salvation, Gray Hairs ſhould be a Crown of Glory, if it be found in the Way of Righteouſneſs, old Men ſpeak your Minds, that young Men may not have your bad Example: What ſay ye of this Salvation? Is it not a moſt glorious Salvation, is it not a moſt excellent Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation that is in your Offer? I intreat you ſpeak your Minds, tell Chriſt ye are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to take the great Salvation; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, whoever he be that will not partake of this Goſpel Salvation; I in the Name and Authority of Chriſt our Maſter, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce eternal and irrevocable War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. Put on your Harneſs, ye ſhall not boaſt when ye put it off again, the Wrath and Fury of God ſhall come upon you to the uttermoſt if ye embrace not this great Salvation: other Wars are but for a time: the greateſt Captains that ever the Earth did carry, are now <hi>laid down in the ſides of the Pit, and their Swords broken under their Heads.</hi> Armies of ten hundred thouſand, a hundred Years Time have laid them all in their Graves, and ended all
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:003424_0018_0FF83C5ED8BB5838"/>
their Conteſts, but there is no Diſcharge of his War that ſhall be concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Chriſt and you, it ſhall become an eternal and moſt terrible War, which ſhall be but beginning when Time is ended: Now Peace or War, which of them will ye chooſe? Dare ye ſend a Charge to Chriſt, and ſay ye will defy him? I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid there will be two Things that many of us ſhall report to day. Firſt, I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid there will be many that will give <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Report to the offer of the great Salvation, and ſay, <hi>Who is the Lord that I ſhould obey him</hi>? I tell you who he is, He is <hi>glorious in Holineſs, fearful in Praiſes, doing Wonders.</hi> O embrace him before he go hence, and give not <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, leſt ye be drowned in the Sea of his Wrath, whence there ſhall be no Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I fear there will be many here to day that will give <hi>Demas</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to this precious Offer: I will go and forſake Chriſt, and embrace this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent World: O bad Exchange! curſed be he that ſhall make it, will ye be of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>'s Humour? I fear there hath been many of that Humour of a long time: but I intreat you once to be wiſe before ye die. I confeſs that Proverb old Fools, are twice Fools; I think old Men that will not embrace the great Salvation, I think ye are triple Fools? What wait ye for? Is there any thing can afford you any Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003424_0019_0FF83C61677837B0"/>
but this great Salvation? Now are ye convinced old Men, that Chriſt is waiting for your Anſwer? I intreat you before ye go hence, ſpeak your minds, what ye think of the great Salvation; Is it not a lovely Salvation, is it not lovely now? What ſay ye to it? I am to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and the Offer is to be taken up at this time, and it is hard to ſay if ever ye ſhall have an Offer again. I would only ſay this to you, and be ſure of it, though I ſhould never be a Partaker of this great Salvation, yet I ſhall be a Witneſs againſt you that are not Partakers of it; I tell and declare unto you, I ſhall be a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt you if ye embrace not the great Salvation: Now old Men are ye perſwaded to embrace it, Let me obteſt you <hi>by the Beauty of Chriſt,</hi> come and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the great Salvation, ye that are travelling upon the Borders of Eternity. Now if ye will give no more, give this, will ye go home and think upon it; I ſhall not be uncharitable, nor enter to judge your Thoughts: I fear there ſhall be many declared and found Guilty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, that we declared unto Heaven we will not embrace the great Salvation, but have trod the Blood of the <hi>Son of God under Foot.</hi> Now I intreat you, every one of you ask at your ſelves if ye be the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that will <hi>preſume in your Hearts to do ſo.</hi> Now I ſhall leave it with you, let it not be a Witneſs againſt you. I ſhall
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:003424_0020_0FF83C62F47D39B0"/>
leave it with this. O come away, old Men, young Men, old Women, and Maids, come and embrace this precious Goſpel Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Ye may ſay, ye bid us come; but we cannot come. I deſire no more of you, but to come with this; Lord I am content to come, but I cannot come. Come once to that, for if once ye be content to receive it, it will not be long before ye be able to receive it: Now ſhall Chriſt depart, and will none of you ſay ye are content to take him? Will ye charge your own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences with this, am I content to take Chriſt and the great Salvation. O bleſt, bleſt, bleſt, be he that is the Author of the great Salvation, and bleſt be he that gets any of the Ends of the Cord of the great Salvation, that we ſink not under the Wrath and Fury of the Lord; Come and embrace this great Salvation, and again I ſay, come and embrace it: For what can ye want if ye have it? I ſhall ſay no more, but cloſe with that Word, Iſai. 62.21. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, the Lord hath proclaimed to the Ends of the World, to thoſe that are far off</hi>: what hath he proclaimed? <hi>Say ye to the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Sion, behold thy Salvation cometh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it cometh.</hi> I ſay to you that are the Ends of the World, Salvation is brought near unto you: <hi>Stout-hearted and far from Righteouſneſs,</hi> the great Salvation is brought near unto you, and will ye ſend it away? O conſider what ye are doing. And to him that can perſwade you to embrace the great ſalvation, we deſire to give praiſe.</p>
