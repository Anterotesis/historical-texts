            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The moſt important QUESTION, CONSIDERED.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <q>
                  <bibl>
                     <hi>ACTS, xvi. 30, 31.</hi>
                  </bibl>
                  <p>—And ſaid, Sirs, What muſt I do to ſaved? And they ſaid, Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved, and thy Houſe.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>AS the great, and true, and I may ſay the only valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able End of all Knowledge, is Practice; even ſo, right Knowledge is moſt neceſſary, in order to right, and regular Action: The Reaſon is, there being in the very Conſtitution of Things, certain Rules for all Humane Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct: Right Action depends upon its Conformity unto them. This is the Caſe in <hi>civil,</hi> or <hi>ſecular</hi> Life: We can't talk in a <hi>Foreign,</hi> nor in our own Langue, before we have learnt it. No Man can ſail a Veſſel into a ſtrange and diſtant Port, without the Art of Navigation. No more can any One be a regular Practitioner in <hi>Phyſick,</hi> without ſome Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the Myſtery thereof.</p>
            <p>So it is in the <hi>moral</hi> Life: There muſt be the Knowledge, before there can be the Practice of Religion. <hi>He that cometh to God, muſt believe that he is—</hi> If we don't know what will be acceptable to God, how can we pleaſe him? We muſt know the Way, that lends to eternal Life, before we can walk in it. Agreeably thereto, ſays <hi>Thomas</hi> to our LORD;</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:008872_0004_103091AB355E9130"/>"We know not whether thou goeſt, and how can we know the Way?"</p>
            <p>NOW as this is our main Buſineſs, and higheſt Concern to ſerve GOD in this Life; that ſo we may partake of his Favour in the next: So it is of equal Importance to us, to underſtand and know the Way, and the Manner how to do the one, that we may enjoy the other. For this Purpoſe therefore, have I choſen, for the ſubject of my preſent Diſcourſe, theſe Words, <hi>What muſt I do to be ſaved, Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhall be ſaved and thy Houſe.</hi> For the underſtanding of which, and the perſon ſpeaking therein; it may'nt be amiſs to conſider the Occaſion, that led the Way, and gave Riſe to them.</p>
            <p>AT this Time, <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle and <hi>Silas</hi> his fellow Labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the Goſpel, were preaching the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of GOD nigh <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi,</hi> a chief City in <hi>Macedonia.</hi> And many reſorted unto them, among whom was a certain Damſel, who, as we are told was <hi>poſſeſſed with a Spirit of Divination, and brought her Maſter much Gain by Soothſaying.</hi> But this notwithſtanding ſhe openly confeſs'd, that <hi>theſe Men were the Servants of the Moſt High God, which ſhow unto us the Way of Salvation. And this ſhe did many Days.</hi> Where we may obſerve, that theſe holy Men, received more Honour, Reſpect, and better Treatment, even from one poſſeſſed of the Devil, than from that ſtupid, and ſinful Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And what an ample Reward did ſhe ſoon recieve there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for! For <hi>Paul being grieved</hi> for her, <hi>turned and ſaid to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, I command thee in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt to come out of her and he came out the ſame Hour.</hi> This made no ſmall Stir. For her Maſters, <hi>when they ſaw that the Hope of their Gain was gone,</hi> were greatly moved.</p>
            <p>HOW dear to ſome, and near their Hearts, their Money, and worldly Intereſt lies! Touch this, and you gall the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to the very Quick: Nothing moves them like it. See the Operation! <hi>They</hi> being thus moved; the Populace alſo being raiſed: What a mighty Uproar ſoon followed! They laid violent Hands on the Apoſtles; dragged them into the <hi>Marketplace,</hi> and hauling them before the <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> brought in a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Complaint againſt them; not for <hi>Murder,</hi> or <hi>Sedition,</hi> or any <hi>enormous</hi> Crime; but being <hi>Jews,</hi> for <hi>teaching Cuſtoms</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:008872_0005_103091AD15CDAE28"/>
as they ſaid, for <hi>Romans</hi> to receive; and this, (to ſay no worſe of it) was a falſe Charge.</p>
            <p>AND yet the Magiſtrates, not regarding their Perſons, or <hi>Sacred Characters,</hi> or the Damſel's Teſtimony in their Favour, or the Trivialneſs and Falſity of the Complaint; (all which muſt needs aggravate their Proceedings, except we may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them totally ignorant of theſe Things:) but without any Examination, or giving them the leaſt Opportunity to defend themſelves againſt this unreasonable Charge, as we read of, in the moſt inhumane and barbarous Manner, ordered them to be ſtripped and beaten. And this not ſlighty; for having <hi>laid many Stripes upon them, they caſt them into Priſon, charging the Jaylor to keep them ſafely. Who having received ſuch a Charge, thruſt them into the inner Priſon, and made their Feet faſt in the Stocks.</hi> And now he it ſeems, concluding all Things were ſafe, commits himſelf to his Bed.</p>
            <p>HERE ſee the pious Devotion, and heavenly Tempers of theſe Servants of GOD! notwithſanding their hard Treatment in the Day, and ſo uncomfortable a Lodging, in a filthy Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon at Night; yet they were ſo far from meditating any Revenge, that <hi>at Midnight they prayed, and ſang Praiſes to God;</hi> likely that they were counted worthy to ſuffer for the Name of CHRIST. And Behold the Event! A <hi>Speedy Anſwer</hi> of their Prayers, and a <hi>Miraculous Deliverance</hi> by a great Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake! By which <hi>the Foundations of the Priſon were Shaken, all the Doors opened, and every ones Bands looſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS Shock, doubtleſs, waked the Jaylor out of his Sleep. Who ſtarting from his Bed in the greateſt Fright; it ſeems, his firſst Thoughts was about the Priſoners; and ſeeing the Priſon Doors open; probably no Way apprehenſive of the Cauſe; but thinking that ſome evil minded Perſon had made Inſurrection, broke open the Priſon, delivered the Priſoners, and they were gone, and withall, that he was no ways able to anſwer it to the Magiſtrates: This added to his Surpriſe, and put him almoſt beſide himſelf. In this Confuſion, <hi>He drew his Sword,</hi> and was about to kill himſelf, but was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by <hi>Paul's</hi> crying <hi>with a loud Voice,</hi> DO THYSELF NO HARM; <hi>for we are all here.</hi> This was as much unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and as great a Surpriſe as the former; though in a
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:008872_0006_103091AF0FDC3228"/>
more agreeable Manner. For this brought him to his Senſes again; altered his bloody Deſign and wrought upon all his Paſſions: Which by this Time were thrown into ſuch a Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and violent Agitation, as cauſed the whole Humane Frame to tremble. And in this <hi>Manner</hi> and <hi>Form,</hi> he ran and threw himſelf at the Apoſtle's Feet.</p>
            <p>NOW it is no ways apparent, that the Jaylor as yet had any Concern about his Soul, or future State; but all this was the natutal Effect of his Surpriſe and a Concern about the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Emergency; though it might greatly ſerve to prepare the Way for his Reception of the Meſſages of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>AFTER this we read of the Jaylor's Queſtion, and the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles Anſwer; <hi>his</hi> kind Offices to them and <hi>their</hi> preaching to him and his Houſe, the Word of the LORD. But poſſibly theſe Things are not ſet down juſt in the ſame Order, in which they happened; a Thing common in the Scriptures. For to me it don't look likely, that this Queſtion was aſked, or anſwered in the Priſon, or while the Jaylor was in his Fright, or in the Beginning of their Converſation, and before he had ſome Information of the Goſpel Way of Salvation; for theſe were a Heathen People, and moſt likely wholly Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to theſe Things.</p>
            <p>AND probably, the whole Affair might be conducted in ſome ſuch Manner as this. When the Jaylor came to the Apoſtles; had a little recovered himſelf, and ſaw the Priſon Doors open, the Perſons Bands looſed; but no Tumult, nor any one gone: It wrought in him ſome good Opinion of <hi>theſe Men;</hi> that they were not ſuch <hi>vile Fellows</hi> as before he had conceived them to be. This diſpoſed him to treat them, in the moſt <hi>courteous</hi> and <hi>hoſpitable</hi> Manner; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly invited them into his Houſe, ordered <hi>their Stripes to be waſhed,</hi> and <hi>Meat to be ſet before them.</hi>

Salvation, thro' the Redemption of JESUS CHRIST: That they <hi>themſelves</hi> were the Servants of the moſt high GOD, and were come to ſhew them <hi>this Way</hi> of Salvation: That for theſe Things <hi>only,</hi> they had been apprehended, beaten and impriſoned: That all this hard, and abuſive Treatment of them was fighting againſt Heaven. <q>Therefore Almighty GOD has thus appeared in this Miraculous Manner, ſhook the Earth, <hi>opened the Priſon Doors, looſed our Bands</hi> and ſet us at Liberty.</q> This, by the Spirit of GOD, wrought ſuch Conviction on the Mind of the Jaylor, as put him on ſome real Concern about his Soul and future State. And now he propoſes this Queſtion, in the Text. <hi>Sirs, what muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> And the Apoſtle anſwers, <hi>Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be Saved, and thy Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HAVING thus prepared the Way. Theſe are the two Things that now lie before us for conſideration, namely, the Jaylor's <hi>Queſtion;</hi> and the Apoſtle's <hi>Anſwers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. The Jaylor's <hi>Queſtion</hi> in theſe Words; <hi>What muſt I do to be Saved?</hi> The Salvation here ſpoken of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> don't mean a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from temporal, but eternal Evil. He don't enquire, how he ſhould eſcape the Magiſtrates <hi>Reſentment</hi> for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe of the Priſoners, or Sickneſs, or Death or any other worldly Trouble; but how he ſhould eſcape eternal Miſery; which now he ſaw himſelf in Danger of. The Queſtion therefore plainly refers to eternal Life, and is an Enquiry about the Way thither.</p>
            <p>THESE Things being conſidered; the Meaning is natural and eaſy: It is not a <hi>captious</hi> Queſtion, with a Deſign to entrap and entangle the Apoſtle in his Diſcourſe; but a <hi>plain honeſt</hi> Queſtion, reſpecting a Man's Duty, and Conduct. And the Occaſion, Manner, and Circumſtances of its Propoſal, ſeem plainly to denote the Honeſty, and Sincerity of the Enquirer; with a hearty Deſire to know the Truth, and the ſame Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>tion to obey it. I ſhall therefore ſay no more in Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of it, but make the following <hi>Remarks</hi> upon it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THIS is a Queſtion of <hi>universal Concern.</hi> There was Nothing in the Jaylor's Circumſtances, that ſhould make it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap>uch concerns me, and you, and every one to enquire, what
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:008872_0008_103091B5FAEF3C08"/>
we muſt do to be ſaved, as it did him. The great Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Enquiry, is the Relation we all ſtand in to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. If there is ſuch a Thing as a future State, eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Puniſhments, an Heaven for the Righteous, and an Hell for the Wicked; if we have all precious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls to ſave or looſe; if this Life is a Prelude to the Other; or our eternal Doom depends upon our Conduct here; and we ſhall ſpend an Eternity, either the <hi>Realms of Light</hi> above, or in <hi>informal Shades of Darkneſs</hi> beneath, juſt as we act a Part on this Stage of Action; (all which, I make no doubt, you will grant at firſt Thought.) Surely when, it is of equal Concern to us all, to know how we may enjoy the Former, and eſcape the Latter. It therefore Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns All, both High and Low, Rich and Poor, Old and Young, Bond and Free; yea, it concerns the King upon the Throne as much as the Peaſant upon the Dunghill.</p>
            <p>YET, are there not ſome of great Deſcent, and high Birth, but of ſuch a low, mean, and fordid Spirit, as to fancy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion don't belong to them? They'll allow that it becomes the Poor, and Wretched in the World, and ſuch as are in low Life, but think it is too melancholy and dejected a State for Princes, the Nobility and Perſons of Rank and Fortune in the World.</p>
            <p>JUST as if theſe <hi>dignifyed</hi> Worms of the Earth were got above their Maker, or beyond the Reach of Omnipotence; or could bear <hi>Everlaſting Burnings</hi> better than others; or that their Souls, like the <hi>Spirits of the Beaſts,</hi> at Death, would <hi>go down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the Earth.</hi> Indeed, there is too much Truth in what One obſerves, upon another Account, <q>That which prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally diſtinguiſhes ſome Men from the Beaſts of the Field is the different Formation of their Bodies: Their Bodies are <hi>Humane;</hi> but they are in a manner Brutal beſide.</q> But however ſuch may amuſe themſelves, with theſe vain Thoughts for the preſent, they may be convinced of their Miſtake, when it is too late.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is a Queſtion of the <hi>laſt Importance,</hi> not only of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Concern, but of the <hi>higheſt</hi> Conſequence. Religion, to take care of the Soul, to prepare for another World, all which in general, means but one and the ſame Thing, is the greateſt
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:008872_0009_103091B9217DCAA0"/>
Concern in Life: 'Tis our main Buſineſs, for this End were we born, and came into the World; 'tis more than Meat or Drink, then Food or Raiment. Yea, all the Concerns of this, Life, tho' in many reſpects great and valuable, yet when compared with <hi>This,</hi> are but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oys and Trifles.</p>
            <p>THIS will eaſily appear, only by conſidering, the infinite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Diſproportion between this, and the coming World. <hi>What is the Chaff to the Wheat?</hi> Saith the Lord. <hi>What is a Man profited, if he gains the whole World, and looſe his own Soul?</hi> Says our Saviour. What is Earth to Heaven? The Body to the Soul? or Time to Eternity? And in a Word: What a <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>contemptible</hi> Thing, is a ſhort Pilgrimage in this ſtormy World, through a thouſand Viciſſitudes, <hi>full</hi> of Aux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety, and Vexation of Spirit, compared with an eternal Duration in the Realms of Light, and Peace, with Rivers of Pleaſure at <hi>God's Right Hand?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>RELIGION therefore, and the Care of the Soul, is the <hi>one Thing needful,</hi> and I may add, the only Thing abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to our well being. We are ready to think, many Things here are neceſſary Enjoyments; ſuch as Life, Health, Riches and Friends; but this is a Miſtake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> None of theſe are abſolutely neceſſary. A Man <hi>may be</hi> happier, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without, than with them. I make no Doubt, but <hi>Lazarus</hi> in <hi>Abraham's Boſom,</hi> notwithſtanding his Want of all Things in this Life, is a Thouſand Times better of it, than the <hi>rich Man</hi> in the Goſpel, with all his Plenty and worldly Grandeur here. But if this <hi>one</hi> Thing be wanting, we are totally ruined, and may be ſure, our Doom will be Miſery, and Wretchedneſs.</p>
            <p>THE great Reaſon is, the inevitable Conſequences of theſe two different Courſes. If we neglect ſo great Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; how can we eſcape the Damnation of Hell! Awful and dreadful the Perdition of ungodly Men! To go into Eternity, to reap the Wages of an ill-ſpent Life! <hi>Who can dwell with devouring Fire, or inhabit everlaſting Burnings?</hi> But if we <hi>lay hold</hi> on eternal Life, by Faith; our End will be Peace; Glory and Bleſſedneſs our Portion forever.</p>
            <p>THERFORE, on the one Hand, the Scripture always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents Religion, and the Care of our Souls, as the only
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:008872_0010_103091BC022E45F8"/>
true Wiſdom, and calls it, <hi>the Wiſdom, that is from above;</hi> by Way of Diſtinction from <hi>that</hi> which is ſaid to be <hi>eartly, ſenſual deviliſh.</hi> And indeed, that Man <hi>only</hi> deſerves the Character of a wiſe Man, that <hi>foreſeeth theſe Evils, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ideth himſelf.</hi> While, on the other Hand, it as often repreſents the Neglect of our Souls, as the greateſt Folly imaginable; and true it is, that no Man in the World lives, and acts ſo void of Underſtanding, and ſo much beſide himſelf, as he that doth this. Neither can there a greater <hi>Dilirium</hi> beſal the Minds of Men, than this: If it would be looked upon, Diſtraction for a Man to run into the Fire; muſt it not be accounted infinitely greater Diſtraction, to throw himſelf headlong into <hi>everlaſting Burnings?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BY this Time, methinks, you are convinced of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of this Queſtion; and that it can't be a Matter of Indifference with you, whether you ſpend an Eternity in Weal or Woe, with Angels of Light above, or with infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirits beneath. And yet,</p>
            <p n="3">3. HOW <hi>few</hi> Perſons comparatively, that make this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry <hi>ſeriouſly</hi> for themſelves! There are too many in the World, that, <hi>Gallio</hi> like, <hi>care for none of theſe Things:</hi> They are ſo eaten up with Pride and Ambition, or ſo immerſed in Pleaſure and ſecular Views, that the World is their GOD <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THERE are others quit of another Turn of Mind, tho' perhaps of no better Principles, or Practice; who love to be talking about Religion: When at the ſame Time, they have no Regard to, or real Concern about it, <hi>eſpecially</hi> as to the practical Part of it. And this may be eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverd, by the Air, and Run of their Diſcourſe, and the Topicks which it turns upon: For it is not an Enquiry, how they ſhall live to GOD, or what they ſhall do to be ſaved: but ſuch as tends more to pull down, than bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            <p>IT is well known, there is a Generation in the World, that hate to work for their Living; who will turn, twiſt, and make uſe of every <hi>mean</hi> Artifice, rather than get their Livelihood by honeſt Induſtry.

And eternal Evils, when apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, have the ſame Influence upon Men, as temporal Ones.

And if he is not altogether of an <hi>Atheiſtical</hi> Turn, he can't but be convinced, <hi>eſpecially</hi> if he lives under the Goſpel, that he is deſigned for another State. That <hi>theſe</hi> Powers and Faculties were given him for real Action, and Improvement—That he is Accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to his Maker for them—That he is here upon his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, muſt act a Part for Eternity, and his future State will depend upon his Conduct here.</p>
            <p>THESE Things being conſidered, how natural, and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able are ſuch like Queries as theſe? What muſt I do? How muſt I improve theſe Talent?

            </p>
            <p>IN all theſe Caſes, I have no Reaſon to think, but that the Queriſts propoſed them <hi>honeſtly,</hi> with a Deſire to know, and be, taught their Duty. But let that be as it will; <hi>theſe</hi> were proper Queſtions to be put to a <hi>Teacher ſent from God.</hi> And we have all Reaſon to believe, they were anſwered <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly,</hi> and in a direct and proper Manner, and <hi>agreeably</hi> to the End and Deſign of the Goſpel. For our Saviour, (altho' when Perſons came to him with <hi>captious</hi> Queſtions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to entangle him in his Diſcourſe; as he <hi>knew what was in Man;</hi> ſo he often anſwered <hi>theſe</hi> Fools according to their Folly; and in ſuch a Manner, as moſt effectually to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found, and take them in their own Craftineſs. Yet) when any came to him with an honeſt Deſign to know the Truth; as became a divine Teacher, and One that taught the Way of Life truly, he <hi>always</hi> inſtructed them therein, with the greateſt Plainneſs, and Simplicity.</p>
            <p>HOW theſe particular Anſwers are to be underſtood, I purpoſe to conſider in the Sequel of this Diſcourſe; when I come to compare them together. But I muſt not proceed, for the Time fails; will therefore haſten to a Concluſion, with one or two Reflections relative to the preſent Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; if your Patience will hold out. The,</p>
            <p>FIRST is, that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are always <hi>urging</hi> and <hi>preſſing</hi> Perſons Duty. I am ſenſible, that to perſuade Men to a Life of Duty, and ſincere Obedience to GOD, is one of the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:008872_0017_103091D16AA18B30"/>
hardeſt Things in the World. For I have not only <hi>Fleſh and Blood,</hi> but alſo the <hi>Powers of Darkneſs</hi> to encounter herein. Beſides all this, there are ſome, who ſay they are <hi>enlightened,</hi> that pretend, that this is a <hi>legal,</hi> and not a <hi>Goſpel</hi> Religion; and are ſo much harping upon Man's Inability to do any Duty, eſpecially before Converſion; that all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſuch can poſſibly do, is an <hi>Abomination</hi> to the Lord; and as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is narural, upon this Suppoſition, ſo they draw it, that no Man before Converſion, ought to pray, or attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Goſpel Ordinances. And all this being ſo agreeable to corrupt Nature, Many believe they have nothing to do, but to ſit ſtill, and wait, till they are <hi>ſpecially moved,</hi> and wrought upon by the Spirit of GOD.</p>
            <p>BUT nowithſtanding what <hi>theſe</hi> Men ſay, if you will go to the ORACLES of GOD, you'll find, that they put us upon Duty from one End of the Bible to the other. And I Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, there is not one <hi>Sacred</hi> Penman, but what preſſes this Matter <hi>beſure Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets, CHRIST and his Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles do it; and they not only urge, and preſs Duty and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but make it one main Point of our Religion; if they don't lay the very Streſs of our Acceptance with GOD and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation upon it.</p>
            <p>THAT this was the Caſe under the <hi>firſt</hi> Covenant, no Man will diſpute. No more will any diſpute it under the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Diſpenſation, if they will read but one or two Texts in <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs, if thou ſhalt hearken diligently unto the Voice of the</hi> LORD <hi>thy</hi> GOD, <hi>to obſerve and to do all his Commandments, which I command thee this Day; that the</hi> LORD <hi>thy</hi> GOD <hi>will ſet thee on high above all the Nations of the Earth.</hi>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">Deut. xxviii, 1.</note> 
               <hi>But if thou wilt not hearken unto the Voice of the</hi> LORD <hi>thy</hi> GOD <hi>to obſerve to do all his Commandments, and Statutes—that all theſe Curſes ſhall come upon thee and overtake thee. Curſed ſhalt thou be in the City</hi> &amp;c.—<hi>Waſh ye, make you clean, put away the Evil of your Doings—ceaſe to do Evil, learn to do well. If ye be willing and obedient, ye ſhall eat the Good of the Land. But if ye refuſe and rebel, ye ſhall be devoured with the Sword: For the Mouth of the</hi> LORD <hi>hath ſpoken it.</hi>

For verily I ſay unto you, till Heaven and Earth paſs, one Jot or one Tittle ſhall in no wiſe paſs from the Law, till all be fulfilled. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever therefore ſhall break one of theſe leaſt Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſhall teach Men ſo, he ſhall be called the leaſt in the Kingdom of Heaven; but whoſoever ſhall do, and teach them, the ſame ſhall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven.</q>

            </p>
            <p>SO the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who preached up Juſtification by <hi>Faith,</hi> and the <hi>Doctrines of Grace,</hi> as much as ever any <hi>inſpired</hi> Perſon did, tell us, <hi>Circumciſion is Nothing, and Uncircumcciſion is Nothing, but the keeping the Commandments of God.</hi>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">1 Cor. vii. 19.</note> The Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, all other Religion without <hi>this,</hi> is of no Value in the ſight of GOD. Now whether we ſhall obey GOD or Men, <hi>Judge ye.</hi> And the,</p>
            <p>SECOND is, that the Scripture <hi>never faults</hi> us for Obedience, or doing Duty in Religion, but <hi>always</hi> for the Neglect of it. The World often condemns us for doing our Duty, but the Scripture never does: And it is ſo far from this, that it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways commends, and approves of that, altho' it be done, but <hi>partially,</hi> or <hi>externally,</hi> or <hi>even</hi> with wrong Ends, and Deſigns. I don't mean, that every Man that has ever done any Duty, will be finally approved of by his Maker. For many ſuch will be condemned; but then, not for the Duties they have done, but for them they have left undone. The Fault don't lie in doing, but in the Deficiency of Duty. So long as a Man keeps in the Path of his Duty, he is right; but when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he turns out of it, <hi>then</hi> he begins to err.</p>
            <p>THE great Reaſon is, the Law of GOD is the <hi>Standard</hi> of our Conduct, and of Right and Wrong. Whatſoever therefore, is a Conformity thereto, is right, and commendable; and what is not, is wrong, and Blame worthy. For inſtance, the Man that profeſſes <hi>well</hi> and lives <hi>ill.</hi> The Fault don't lie in the Profeſſion, but in the Practice. So he that doth a
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:008872_0019_103091D6516C0D70"/>
good Action, with an ill Deſign, the Action is right and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable; but the End is ſinful.</p>
            <p>AND indeed <hi>Duty</hi> to GOD, <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Falſhood, Right</hi> and <hi>Wrong,</hi> as they are founded in the Conſtitution of Things, ſo they are inflexible, and unchangeable in their very Natures. The One is excellent, and glorious, the other hateful, and abominable; and they'll remain evermore the ſame, let them be found where they will; neither can they be altered in their Nature by the Quality of the Doer, nor the End in doing them. The Sun is the ſame under the Earth, as it is above it. A <hi>Jewel of Gold</hi> is of the ſame value in a <hi>Swine's Snout,</hi> as it is in a Damſel's Ear. Truth is the ſame glorious Thing when ſpoken by a Devil, as by an Angel of Light. Wilful Murder is the ſame horrible Crime when committed by a Saint, as by a Sinner: And tho' a Man had never ſo good a Deſign in it, yet it wont make <hi>that</hi> a lawful Action. No more will the vileſt End make the Praiſing of GOD, horrible Wickedneſs. For it is not the Quality of the Doer, that denominates the Action either good or bad; but the Quality or Nature of the Action denominates the Doer. Apoſtacy, and Rebellion would make an Angel a Devil; and Grace and Goodneſs would make a Devil, an Angel of Light.</p>
            <p>FOR this Reaſon, (becauſe Virtue and Vice take their Riſe from their Conformity, and Non-conformity to their Standard, the Law of GOD) it is that the Scripture always commends Duty and Obedience, tho' it be found among much Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the abounding of which, tho' never ſo much, don't alter the Nature of that which is right.</p>
            <p>HOW plain is this in <hi>Jebu's</hi> Caſe! Altho' <hi>he took no heed to walk in the Law of the Lord God of Iſrael, neither departed from the Sins of Jeroboam which made Iſrael to Sin;</hi> yet the LORD bears him this Teſtimony, <q>Thou haſt done well in executing that which is right in mine Eyes, and haſt done unto the Houſe of Ahab according to all that was in mine Heart.</q> § And is it not as plain in <hi>Ahab's?</hi> Who, when GOD denounced his Judgments againſt him by the Prophet, <hi>rent his Cloaths,</hi> and humbled himſelf. Which, <hi>moſt likely</hi> was only in an external Manner; yet this was right ſo far as it
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:008872_0020_103091D937F80C78"/>
went. Therefore GOD takes Notice of it, and ſays, <q>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he humbleth himſelf before me, I will not bring the Evil in his Days.</q>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">1 Kings xxi. 29</note>
            </p>
            <p>AGAIN, When GOD ſhew his <hi>antient</hi> People for their Sins, <hi>they returned and enquired early after God—</hi> and altho' <hi>they flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with their Months—and their Hearts was not right with him—Yes he being full of Compaſſion, forgave their Iniquities;</hi> that is, ſo far that he did'nt deſtroy them.<note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

from any One; but it is altogether on the contrary Hand.

The true Meaning is, that believing in JESUS CHRIST is the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:008872_0023_103091E211630108"/>
Way to, and the Means by which we, under the Goſpel are to obtain, and inherit eternal Life; or in other Words, that eternal Life is promiſed by the Goſpel, to them that believe in JESUS CHRIST; and if the Jaylor would comply here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, he ſhould inherit the ſame: And ſo may any other Perſon too, on <hi>theſe</hi> Terms.</p>
            <p>THIS ſeems to be intimated in the laſt Clauſe of the Verſe, <hi>And thy Houſe,</hi> that is, thy Family alſo, ſhall be ſaved upon <hi>their Believing.</hi> It may alſo mean, that upon the Jaylor's Faith, his Family ſhould enjoy the Goſpel Priviledges, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

But this is not what I intend to inſiſt upon; but the Way that leads to eternal Life, which we muſt all walk in, or we ſhall never ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive thither. Here the Jaylor inquiries, <q>What muſt I do to be Saved? or which is the Way to eternal Life?</q> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> Anſwers, "This is the Way, believe on the LORD JESUS CHRIST." This is the Direction given us by an inſpired Perſon, and a moſt ſkilful Pilot: And the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry is; What is the Meaning of it? What is it to believe? or rather, What is the Apoſtle's ſenſe of <hi>believing</hi> in this Text.</p>
            <p>THIS is a Subject not new, but of equal Date with the Goſpel Religion; of great Weight, and Moment, and a corner Stone in this <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Building. Altho' it has been greatly <hi>exhauſted,</hi> much ſaid, and wrote upon it; yea, Volums and <hi>Folios</hi> filled with it, yet now it needs to be handled by an able Hand, a ſkilful Pen, and in a <hi>much better</hi> Manner than I am able to do it: And that becauſe of the many miſtaken No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about, and wrong Conſtructions that are put upon it. And in as much as Truth never ſuffers by Examination; and every One ought to lend an Hand, yea exert their utmoſt Efforts in defence of, and againſt the Errors and Miſtake<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> obſerve one or two Things in general. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. IT is common in the Scripture, that one <hi>chriſtian Grace</hi> or Quallification ſtands for, and is uſed to ſignify all the Reſt: tho' but One be expreſſed, yet every other Grace is included therein. There are ſeveral Things neceſſary to make up and complete the Idea and Character of a real good Man; ſuch as <hi>Holineſs, Righteouſneſs, Mercy</hi> and the like. Now the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſpeaking of ſuch an One, ſeldom mentions him, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one or other of theſe Characters, and by <hi>that,</hi> means all the reſt. Thus the <hi>merciful</hi> Man in Scripture means, not only one that ſheweth Mercy, but him that has all the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications of a real religious Man: So alſo the <hi>upright,</hi> the <hi>juſt</hi> and the <hi>faithful</hi> Man, all mean the ſame. This is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our common Way of ſpeaking in this Caſe: When we ſpeak of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> at one Time, we call him a true <hi>Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,</hi> at another the <hi>Believer;</hi> by which we mean not only him that has theſe particular Graces, but One that has every chriſtian Grace and Virtue.</p>
            <p>IN like Manner, the Scripture ſpeaks of ſeveral Things, as neceſſary Terms of our Acceptance with GOD; ſuch as <hi>Faith</hi> in CHRIST, <hi>Repentance</hi> of Sin, the <hi>Love</hi> of GOD: And yet at the ſame Time promiſes the Favour of GOD to each of theſe Particulars. In which Caſe, it muſt always be ſuppoſed that the others are couched therein, and to be underſtood thereby; and that becauſe <hi>the Way of Salvation is but One,</hi> and the Scriptures are all of a Piece, tho' Different in Expreſſion. Here is the Reaſon, that the Promiſe is made to ſuch different Things, <hi>viz.</hi> To Believing. <hi>He that believeth on the Son hath everlaſting Life.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">John iii. 36.</note> To Obedience, <hi>If ye keep my Commandments, ye ſhall abide in my Love</hi>

               <note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. x 32.</note> And poſſibly in ſuch a Manner, the Words under Conſideration, are be underſtood. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Apoſtle's <hi>Anſwer</hi> here to the Jaylor, is the ſame <hi>in ſenſe and Subſtance</hi> with the other Anſwers given in Scripture, to the ſame Queſtion. I have ſhewn before, that this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:008872_0025_103091EA2B637BA0"/>
has been aſked various Times, and theſe following Anſwers given thereto, <hi>viz.</hi> That given to <hi>Paul</hi> was <q>Ariſe and go into the City.</q> To the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ing Man in the Goſpel, <q>Keep the Commandments.</q> To <hi>Peter's</hi> Converts, <q>Repent and be baptiſed.</q> And to the Jaylor, <q>Believe on the LORD JESUS CHRIST.</q> Now as thoſe Queſtions were all really but One; ſo are not all theſe Anſwers really the ſame? tho' different in Words, yet dont they mean one and the ſame Thing? Nothing is more frequent in both Scripture, and common Language, than to expreſs the ſame Thing, by various Words and in different Forms of Expreſſion.</p>
            <p>YOU may ſay with <hi>Nicodemus</hi> in another caſe, <q>How can theſe Things be? The Jaylor was put upon believing, but the others upon working and doing.</q> It is true, they were; but then, was not the Jaylor as much? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s not Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, as much, doing and acting as any other Duty what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is? I know not why the Word (<hi>Works,</hi> or <hi>working</hi> as uſed in a religious Senſe) is reſtrained to <hi>bodily Exerciſe,</hi> or external Action; or why it is not as applicable to the internal Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Soul <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I am ſure Action or Working is not ſo much the Property of Body, or Matter, as it is a Mind and Spirit. The Love of GOD, and Repentance of Sin are as much Works and Acts of Obedience, as any external Duty, whatſoever. And is not Faith or Believing the ſame?</p>
            <p>YOU may anſwer and ſay, <q>No; for Faith is the Gift of GOD.</q> I grant it; and ſo is Love, Repentance, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and every chriſtian Grace the <hi>Gift of God.</hi> But then the Meaning is not, that believing, loving, and repenting are the Acts of the Divine Being; for they are the Actings of the Soul. It is not GOD that <hi>believes, loves,</hi> and <hi>repents;</hi> but it is the Soul that performs theſe Acts. The Truth is, by Strength received from CHRIST, the Soul is enabled to put them forth; and in this very Light, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> clearly ſets this Matter. <hi>I can do all Things thro' Chriſt which Strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me.</hi>

            <p>I AM very confident the Scripture uſes the Word <hi>(Works)</hi> in the ſame Manner and applies it to the internal Actions of

               <note n="*" place="bottom">John vi. 29.</note> If theſe Things are ſo, then are not theſe Anſwers ſimilar?</p>
            <p>I AM no Ways inſenſible, that the Scripture makes a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction between <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Works;</hi> which is the ſame, that Divines generally do between the <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>redenda,</hi> and <hi>Facienda</hi> of Religion; that is, the Things to be believed, and the Things to be done. A Diſtinction very juſt! for there is a wide Difference between them: The one is the Aſſent of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, the other the Conſent of the Will. The former is the Principle of Action, and the latter the Practice upon it. But I don't ſee that this any Ways affects the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Argument, either in Whole or in Part. It don't follow from this, that Believing is not a Work or Act of Obedience, when it is a Compliance with a divine Precept: All that it proves is, that Believing is a diſtinct Thing from Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Loving, and doing Juſtice.</p>
            <p>BUT after all, you may ſay, as ſome have taught; <q>The Law puts us upon doing, but the Goſpel upon Believing.</q> Here I would aſk, How you know this? You'll eaſily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <q>The Goſpel ſays it in plain Words, <hi>Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi>
               </q> But at the ſame Time, dont it put us as much upon doing, and us plainly ſay? <hi>If you will enter into Life, keep the Commandments.</hi> And our Saviour, <hi>Not every One, that ſaith unto me, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the King of Heaven, but he that doeth the Will of my Father which is in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW are not <hi>theſe</hi> Texts of the ſame divine Authority, and as much to be regarded as the <hi>other? Eſpecially</hi> if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that in the Goſpel Revelation, we are oftener urged to Duty and Obeying, than we are to Faith and Believing; and if you'll ſearch from one End thereof to the other, you'll
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:008872_0027_103091EDA62FF488"/>
find, at <hi>leaſt,</hi> two Texts in Favour of the former, to one in Favour of the latter. In this great Queſtion now under Conſideration, which (as I have ſhewn before) has been aſked in the Scripture eight Times; the Anſwers thereto have been given <hi>ſix</hi> Times for doing and obeying, and but <hi>twice</hi> for believing.</p>
            <p>HOW then muſt we underſtand theſe Things? Are there two or three different Ways to Heaven? Is divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion become <hi>fallible,</hi> that there is no depending on it, or ſo <hi>myſterious,</hi> that none can underſtand it? Is the <hi>infallible</hi> Spirit of GOD, got bewildered, and ſo gives different Directions in the important Affair of our Salvation? at one Time ſends us to the Covenant of <hi>Works,</hi> at another to the Covenant of <hi>Grace?</hi> Tells One to believe in CHRIST, Another to take his Yoke upon him; and a Third, to keep the Commands of the moral Law? Or, are CHRIST, and his Apoſtles at Variance in their Doctrines, and Inſtructions, and not only militate againſt one another, but againſt themſelves too?</p>
            <p>IN this Caſe, what muſt we do? Are we left altogether at Uncertainties? Is every Man at Liberty to ſettle his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in Religion, according to his own Humour and Fancy, and pick and chooſe ſuch Scriptures only, as he can ſhape to his Mind? Or muſt we fix down upon ſome <hi>certain</hi> Texts, and conſter them in the moſt <hi>rigid</hi> Manner, as ſome are wont to do, and then at all. Adventures buckle and bend the Reſt to them; tho' it be never ſo contrary to all Rules of Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, and Interpretation. If this will do, then the Rule for underſtanding the Scriptures, given by a great Divine, which is a good One, for aught I know, may take Place here: That is, <hi>That thoſe Duties that are moſt inſisted on, and ofteneſt repeated in the Scriptures, are of the greateſt Weight, and moſt to be regarded, &amp; thoſe that are leſs inſiſted on, and more ſeldome mentioned, are of leſs Importance, and not ſo much to be regarded.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:008872_0028_103091EF4F30DEC8"/>AS <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſaid of <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Dreams, ſo I may ſay of <hi>theſe</hi> Scriptures; they are but one, and the Interpretation is one. They all lead us unto CHRIST, as the only Saviour, and into the Way, he propoſes to ſave us by; that is, to acknowledge him, ſuch a <hi>divine Perſon</hi> as he is revealed in the Goſpel; depend upon him for Salvation, and follow him; that is, comply with his Religion. Thus when Faith is ſpoken of as the Term of Acceptance with GOD; it means not only that we believe CHRIST to be the Saviour, but alſo that we receive the Doctrines of the Goſpel, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with its Precepts. So when Obedience is made neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Salvation; is not the ſame Thing implied? that there muſt be the receiving of the Doctrines, as well as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with the Precepts of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>AGAIN. When our Saviour at various Times directs us, to <hi>believe in him; take his Yoke upon us; follow him,</hi> and <hi>keep his Commandments.</hi> Is not the Counſel and Advice uniform, and tho' different in Words, yet all aiming at the ſame Thing? And are not each one of theſe Duties <hi>expreſſive,</hi> and implicative of all the reſt? Juſt ſo it is in the Caſes before mentioned. The Apoſtle tells the Jaylor, <hi>Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> Now dont every One take his Meaning to be, that the Joylor muſt believe CHRIST to be the Saviour, become his Diſciple, and follow him, in order to Salvation? And when CHRIST directs the young Man in the Goſpel, the Way to Life, the Reſult is the ſame; the End of their Converſation was, <hi>Sell that thou haſt, give to the Poor, come and follow me, and thou ſhalt have Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in Heaven.</hi> Where is there then any material Difference in <hi>theſe</hi> Anſwers? For my part, I can ſee none.</p>
            <p>IF you ſhould be diſpoſed to reply once more <q>If the Caſe be ſo, why are theſe Things ſo differently expreſſed in the Scripture?</q> The Anſwer may be, to let us know, that the goſpel Religion, is a Religion of the whole Man; that the Underſtanding and Will, both Heart and Life muſt be engaged in it; there muſt be both Faith and Works; and that theſe are all of a Piece; GOD has <hi>joined</hi> them together, and no Man may <hi>put</hi> them aſſunder. Yea, they are ſo cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> connected, that you can't ſeparate them, without deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:008872_0029_103091F0F8833D48"/>
them both: There can be no Goſpel Faith, without Obedience, nor a Goſpel Obedience, without Faith.</p>
            <p>AND I may add, as another Reaſon hereof; poſſibly theſe Anſwers were given in this different Manner, <hi>on purpoſe</hi> to adapt them to the particular Circumſtances of theſe Queriſts, which were very different. <hi>Peter's</hi> Converts were ſome, that had a Hand in CHRIST'S Crucifixion; therefore he tells them, "Repent, of this your Wickedneſs, and be baptiſed," The young Man in the Goſpel was diſpoſed to do ſome Thing for eternal Life, and poſſibly tho't, he could merit it thereby: Therefore CHRIST <hi>wiſely</hi> takes him in his own Way, and tells him, <hi>Keep the Conmandments;</hi> but finally leads him into the Goſpel Scheme of following him. This Jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor it ſeems, was a <hi>Heathen,</hi> and likely, an utter Stranger to Revelation; therefore the Apoſtle tells him <hi>Believe on the</hi> LORD JESUS CHRIST.</p>
            <p>THIS brings me to the particular Conſideration of <hi>theſe Words,</hi> as I propoſed, which is to enquire, What is meant here, by <hi>Believing</hi> on the LORD JESUS CHRIST. And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs this means ſomething more than the Belief of Devils, or any wicked Men, ſomething peculiar to GOD'S own Children, that is, the <hi>Faith of</hi> GOD'S <hi>Elect:</hi> To which the Goſpel promiſes eternal Life. For the Apoſtle ſays here, <hi>Believe—and thou ſhalt be Saved.</hi> And is the ſame Thing, which Divines are wont to call a <hi>juſtifying</hi> or <hi>ſaving</hi> Faith. So called, not becauſe there is any Thing meritorious in it, or that it juſtifies us in the Sight of GOD by virtue of its own Worth, and Excellence; but becauſe it hath pleaſed GOD in his great Condeſcention to Men, to make it the Term of our Acceptance with him, thro' the Redemption of his Son<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And ſo He will beſtow eternal Life on all ſuch, in whom it is found.</p>
            <p>'TIS a little beſide my preſent Subject to ſhew, how this divine Principle is wrought in the Soul; yet I would obſerve once for all, That it is done and effected by the divine Agency; or if you like the Phraſe better, by the <hi>ſpecial</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of the Holy Spirit upon the Soul; enlightening the Underſtanding, renewing the Will, and aiding, and aſſiſting our weak and feable Powers, in this Work of Grace. He that has true Faith, is one <hi>born of the Spirit.</hi> But then, this
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:008872_0030_103091F63AD26150"/>
is generally, and ordinarily done by, or through the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentality of Means, ſuch as the Miniſtry of the Word, the Goſpel, and its Ordinances, as the Apoſtle obſerves. <hi>How ſhall they believe in him, of whom they have not heard? And how ſhall they hear without a Preacher?</hi> And thus concludes, <hi>So then Faith cometh by Hearing, and Hearing by the Word of God.</hi>

            <p>NOW in diſcribing this great Article of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, I ſhall not go into the Method, (as ſome have done) of deſcribing it in a <hi>logical</hi> Manner, by its Object, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, its Matter and Form, its Cauſes and Effects; nor take the <hi>Opinions</hi> of the Learned; but the <hi>holy Scriptures,</hi> which are the only Rule of Faith and Manners, for my Guide and Directory herein: Being of Opinion, that as it is Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alone, which has made Faith in the Redeemer, the Term of our Acceptance with GOD; ſo Revelation is the beſt Judge of this Matter; and the liklieſt. Way to get a true Underſtanding of it, is to ſearch the Scriptures, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare one Part with another. Accounting alſo, that the Deſcription of <hi>this Faith,</hi> as it is given by CHRIST himſelf, and his holy Apoſtles, is more accommodated to the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> and ſimplicity of the Goſpel Religion; and better adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Humane</hi> Capacities, <hi>eſpecially</hi> thoſe of the vulgar Sort, than all the nice and <hi>critical</hi> Diſtinctions in the World, that are made herein by the Learned. According to the Goſpel then I take it, that a <hi>ſaving Faith</hi> contains theſe three Things following; all neceſſary and eſſential to it, I ſay <hi>eſſential,</hi> becauſe if either be wanting, it ceaſes to be ſuch a Faith. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. A REAL <hi>Belief</hi> of the Truth of divine Revelation, or that the Scriptures are the Word of GOD: That is, a full Aſſent of the Mind, to the Truth of all the divine Doctrines, and Propoſitions therein contained. And this ariſing not merely from Cuſtom or Education, but from ſolid Reaſon, and a full Conviction of the Truth of theſe Things, by proper Evidence, and ſuch as the Nature of the Caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. The Sum of which is, that <hi>there is one God, and me Mediator between God and Man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> That
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:008872_0031_103091F92470DB80"/>
He is the only Saviour of the World; and that the Goſpel is the only Way of Salvation, beſure to them that live under it. This is the Kind of Faith, the Apoſtle ſpeaks of; <hi>without</hi> which, <hi>it is impoſſible to pleaſe God. For he that cometh to God, muſt believe that he is, and that he is a Rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him.</hi>

ANOTHER Thing contained in a <hi>ſaving Faith,</hi> is a <hi>Truſting</hi> and <hi>Depending</hi> on JESUS CHRIST for Life and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; on his Sacrifice for Pardon of Sin, and on his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs for Juſtification before GOD. This, I take to be the Meaning of theſe Scripture Phraſes, <hi>Coming to Chriſt</hi> for Life, and <hi>looking to him</hi> for Salvation. JESUS CHRIST is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in the Scripture, as a Redeemer and Saviour. Now Faith, as it correſponds, and anſwers to theſe noble Characters, is <hi>Trust</hi> and <hi>Reliance;</hi> 'tis applying to CHRIST, as the great Phyſician, to heal our ſpiritual Maladies; a flying to him, as the only Refuge, to ſhelter us from the Wrath of GOD.</p>
            <p>FROM a Sight of CHRIST'S Abilities and Willingneſs to ſave, and a Senſe of its own Wants, the Soul is moved to put its Truſt under the Shadow of his Wings, to depend on him for all its Wants in this Life, to be conducted thro' Death; and finally preſented <hi>faultleſs</hi> and <hi>blameleſs</hi> before the Throne of GOD. This is another neceſſary Part of ſaving Faith, but yet both theſe are not the Whole; altho' ſome, if I miſtake not, have repreſented it in this Light, as only a believing JESUS CHRIST to be the Saviour, and reſting
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:008872_0032_103091FACDFE13B8"/>
in him for Salvation. Yet if I may be allowed to give my Opinion, I muſt think, that all this comes ſhort of a ſaving Faith; that one principle Part is yet behind; yea all this may be without the leaſt Participation of a <hi>divine Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FOR where is the Inconſiſtency of wicked Men's truſting in GOD for the Salvation of their Souls? I can ſee none. <hi>They</hi> are as fearful of Miſery, and as willing to be happy as any others; and when they ſee Danger approaching, and no Help any where elſe, they will fly to GOD, and truſt in him therefor. This is the Way of the worſt Men in Times of Danger. Thus the Scripture repreſents the Matter; When GOD <hi>ſlew them, then they ſought him.</hi>

None Evil can come upon us.</hi> Was not this the <hi>Barrier</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> in CHRIST'S Time, againſt their Rejection? When they ſaid, <q>We have <hi>Abraham</hi> to our Father, that is, we are the Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Promiſe of GOD is to us, it cannot ſail, and this is our Dependance.</q> And if we come to plain Matter of Fact; is not this the Caſe with Many, of corrupt Principles, and no better Lives? They have a Hope in GOD; and if you'll inquire into the Reaſon of it, they'll boldly tell you, <q>We know we are Sinners, but CHRIST has died to ſave ſuch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is Merit enough in him; he is a whole Saviour, and our ſole Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance is on the Righteouſneſs and Merits of JESUS CHRIST.</q> But you'll ſay, <q>All this is Nothing but <hi>Preſumption,</hi> a falſe Hope, and Truſt.</q> I know it well enough; but all Hope and Truſt in GOD will be no better, if there is No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe. Wherefore,</p>
            <p n="3">3. The laſt Thing contained in a <hi>ſaving</hi> Faith, is the <hi>Love of God,</hi> or a <hi>Principle of univerſal Obedience</hi> reigning in the Heart. I ſay Love, or a Principle of Obedience; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I take it, that Love is the very Principle itself, that operates in Obedience. Love, Benevolence, or a Diſpoſition
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:008872_0033_103091FC76CB5BE8"/>
to do good and right, (all which are the ſame in Principle<note n="*" place="bottom">This Principle is a moſt noble, divine Perfection, whereby the Supreme Being is always diſpoſed to act in the wiſeſt, and beſt Manner; and to, treat all his Creatures; as it is moſt fit and reaſonable, they ſhould be treated by him. And is called by various Names, according to the Diverſity of its Operation, which ariſes in a great Meaſure from the different State and Condition of the Object it is exerciſed upon. For Inſtance, when God reveals himſelf, and keeps his Covenant, it is called Truth and Faithfulneſs; when he communicates Good, it is called Goodneſs, or Benevolence; when he pities the Diſtreſſed, 'tis Mercy and Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, when he approves of any, 'tis Love, Eſteem, or Complacency; and when he renders to any, according to their Deſert, either of Merit, or Demerit, 'tis Juſtice and Righteouſneſs. Thus all theſe divine Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which to our narrow Capacities, appear many and various, are, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally but an infinite, and moſt glorious ONE. Even as GOD and CHRIST are One. And this ſame divine Principle, when we are made to Partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate thereof, influences, and operates juſt in the ſame Manner, according to its Meaſure, and our Capacity therefor. The ſame Principle, that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe us to Kinkneſs and Charity toward our Fellow Creatures, will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe us to Love and Eſteem, Subjection and Obedience to the Supreme Being and all others, that are worthy and deſeving of the ſame.</note>) in every Being whatſoever, is the great Spring of all right and rational Action, both of Munificence in the Supreme, or any ſuperior Being, and of Obedience, and Subjection in an inferior, and dependant Being. Thus the great Source of all the Divine Beneficence toward the whole Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, is Love. This I ſhall illuſtrate in one Inſtance only that is, the Redemption of CHRIST, and this I'll do in the Words of Inſpiration, <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting Life.</hi>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">John ill. 16.</note> This is the Spring of all real Beneficence in the Rich and Wealthy, toward the Poor and Needy; and of true parental Care for Poſterity. In like Manner, the Spring is the ſame, from whence all dutiful Behaviour in an Inferior does proceed, in Children towards their Parents, in Subjects towards the Magiſtrate, and in the Creature towards it's Maker. This noble, and <hi>divine</hi> Principle, I take to be implied in a <hi>ſaving</hi> Faith; and not only ſo, but the actual Operation of it too, at leaſt, ſo far as to bow the Heart, bond the Will, and bring every Faculty of the Soul into Subjection to CHRIST. Therefore, I expreſſed it before, as a Principle reigning in the Heart.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:008872_0034_10309201DB1793D0"/>IN a Word then, a <hi>ſaving Faith</hi> is the Submiſſion of the whole Man to JESUS CHRIST, as our Saviour, Lord, and Maſter; a believing and depending on him for Salvation, and yielding up ourſelves to him, as his Diſciples, and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers; or in other Words, a hearty Compliance, or falling in with, the Goſpel Way of Salvation. This, I can't but think, is the main Point, the Spirit and <hi>Quinteſſence</hi> of a <hi>Sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith.</hi> Nothing ſhort of it is the Thing; but when once a Perſon comes to this, he has the Goſpel Term of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with GOD; the Faith that intereſts us in the <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> of CHRIST.</p>
            <p>THE whole Affair, as Things appear to me, ſtands in this Light; Mankind by their Sin, and Rebellion had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the living GOD; by which, a great Breach was made between them. The Moſt High, by the Goſpel, is bringing about their Return, and a Reconciliation between him and them. This is all done in a <hi>Covenant</hi> Way; 'tis a ſolemn Tranſaction between GOD and Men, and ſome Thing to be done by both Parties. The Language is the ſame now, as it was in antient Times; <hi>I will be your God, and ye ſhall be my People;</hi> tho' the Terms hereof, are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing different now, from what they were then. The Moſt High firſt makes the Motion for our Return; this he does by revealing his Mind and Will, concerning our Salvation; offering his own Son to be a Mediator herein; appointing the Terms of our Reconciliation, and inviting us to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the ſame.</p>
            <p>NOW our Return to GOD muſt be, as one expreſſes it, "An Eccho to this Voice of the LORD." An Anſwer to theſe Calls, and ſuch a Behaviour, as bears ſome Analogy to theſe divine Motions; that is, a cordial Entertainment of theſe Meſſages, accepting theſe Offers, and complying with theſe Terms. This the Scripture in general calls Faith. Thus we are ſaid to be <hi>ſaved thro' Faith;</hi> and <hi>juſtified, not by the Works of the Law; but by the Faith of Chriſt.</hi> But then, <hi>this Return,</hi> as it reſpects the different Ways, wherein GOD is moving toward us, bears different Denominations, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the various Actings of the Soul herein. For In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as Faith is a Receiving the Doctrines of Revelation
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:008872_0035_10309204C05CE540"/>
for Truth; it is called <hi>Belief,</hi> as it is an accepting of CHRIST as our Saviour; it is called <hi>Truſt</hi> and Reliance; and as it is a Compliance with the Goſpel Way of Salvation, it is called <hi>Obedience.</hi> In this Senſe, I underſtand a <hi>ſaving</hi> Faith to mean all theſe Acts of the Soul, Believing, Truſting and Obeying. And this is the Return of the whole Man to GOD, every Ways correſpondent to theſe divine Motives, wherein GOD applies himſelf to every Faculty of the Soul, and has ſo adapted them, as to draw the ſame into Exerciſe and Action. Thus the Revelation of divine Truth, is to employ our Underſtandings; the Offers of CHRIST, and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, to move and allure our Affections; and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Goſpel, to put our Will, and active Powers upon Action, and compliance therewith. Now when all theſe Faculties are thus cordially ſet to work toward GOD, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with theſe Deſigns of Grace; no Doubt our Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation to him is accompliſhed. This is the Sinner's <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> to GOD, according to the Goſpel, and whoever thus complies, and ſo anſwers theſe Calls, has the <hi>Faith of God's Elect,</hi> and is an Heir to eternal Life.</p>
            <p>IN this View of Faith, when theſe ſeveral Actings of the Soul therein, are compared together, <hi>thoſe</hi> of the Will muſt have the Preheminence; and a Submiſſion to CHRIST, is the moſt noble Part of Faith; in as much as the practical Part of Religion, is preferable to the Knowledge, and Profeſſion thereof, and that the Illumination of the Underſtanding, and the Alluring of the Affections, are but the Means, and for this End, to gain the Will, and bring the Man into an <hi>intire</hi> Subjection to the Obedience of CHRIST.</p>
            <p>IN this ſame Manner, Dr. <hi>Watts,</hi> if I miſtake not, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes a <hi>ſaving</hi> Faith, or <hi>Coming</hi> to CHRIST; And Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> in his <hi>Annotations,</hi> having been ſpeaking of Faith, as an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the Propoſitions of the Goſpel, and Truſting in CHRIST for Salvation, ſays in theſe Words, <q>Which no Man can indeed do, without doing what in him lieth, to fulfil the Condition upon which CHRIST hath promiſed Life, and Salvation; that is, keeping the Commandments of GOD.</q>

               <note n="*" place="bottom">John i. 12.</note> What is meant by receiving CHRIST here? You will ſay perhaps, <q>Believing and truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him.</q> This is true, but is this all? Dont it as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally mean receiving his Commandments, and keeping them? Can a Man receiving CHRIST, and not be his Diſciple, and Follower, or without doing his Will? If you think this is ſtretching the Matter too far; yet you'll own, it is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving CHRIST, as he is revealed in the Goſpel. And this will bring it to the ſame Thing. For Nothing is plainer than this, that CHRIST is there ſet forth, as our <hi>Prophet</hi> to teach us; our <hi>Prieſt</hi> to make Atonement for us; and our <hi>King</hi> to reign in and over us. Now can there be a receiving him in all theſe Offices, without an intire Subjection to his Government? Believing in him may receive him in the firſt, and truſting in him, in the ſecond of theſe <hi>Capacities,</hi> but 'tis Obedience that receives him as our King; and nothing ſhort of this, can be a proper Acknowledgement of him as <hi>ſuch.</hi> 'Tis not all the World can make me believe, a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be a loyal Subject of King <hi>George,</hi> that lives in open Rebellion againſt him.</p>
            <p>AGAIN. When the Scripture deſcribes true Faith, ſo as to diſtinguiſh it from all Counterfeits; it tells us, <hi>It purifies the Heart; it worketh by Love.</hi>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">Gal. v. 6.</note> And alſo, that this <hi>Love</hi> don't lie <hi>in Word, neither in Tongue, but in Deed;</hi> that is, in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. By all which, it is plain, that theſe Qualities, and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations, the <hi>Purity</hi> of the Heart, <hi>loving</hi> and <hi>obeying</hi> GOD, are of the Eſſe, and the vital Acts of Faith; not of believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrictly conſidered, but of a <hi>ſaving</hi> Faith; and that as much as Form, and Extenſion, or any other Quality, is of the Eſſence of Matter. Only remove theſe Qualities from it, and it ceaſes to be <hi>ſuch</hi> a Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:008872_0037_1030920818FE0688"/>TRUE Faith has Love and Obedience in its very Nature, as much as the Sun has Light, and Leaven its fermenting Quality. The very Ideas we have of theſe two Objects, as ſuch, ariſe from theſe eſſential Qualities; the Idea of the one, is its Light or Shining; and of the other, its ferment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Quality. Remove theſe Qualities, and you loſe the Ideas of theſe Objects; take away the Light from the one, and it is not a <hi>Sun,</hi> deſtroy the fermenting Quality of the other, and it ceaſes to be <hi>Leaven.</hi> Even ſo it is in Faith; take away theſe Qualities of Love and Obedience, and it is not <hi>ſaving.</hi>

            <p>HOW full to my Purpoſe is the Apoſtle <hi>James? But wilt thou know, O vain Man, that Faith without Works,</hi> that is, without Obedience <hi>is dead?</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">James ii. 20.</note> If this be ſo, then Faith can't have any Life before there is Works; and then it as plainly follows, that it is Works, that give Life to it.<note n="¶" place="bottom">If this ſhould ſeem ſtrange to any, I deſire them to conſider, that the true Meaning of this Word, (Works) as the Scriptures uſes it in a religious Senſe, is Obedience to God. And by it (as I have ſhewn before) the Scripture means an internal, as well as external Obedience. So here and all along in this Diſcourſe, I mean by it Repentance of Sin, the Love of God, and the Submiſſion, and Conformity of the Heart, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> as Life to his Will. Now theſe Acts and Operations of the Soul being joined to that of Believing, do conſtitute a ſaving Faith. And in this Manner I think, the Apoſtle deſcribes the Faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> when he ſays, <hi>Was not Abraham juſtified by Works when he had offered Iſaac his Son upon the Altar.</hi> And then tells us: This was the fulfilling of that Scripture. <hi>Abraham believed God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The general Anſwer is, This Act of his Obedience proved and evidenced the ſincerity of his Faith. But is this the Apſtle's Senſe of it? Don't he rather mean, that <hi>Abraham's</hi> offering his Son in Obedience to God's Command, was explanatory of, and diſcovered the Nature, and Quality of the Faith, which was counted to him for Righteousneſs? And ſhewed wherein it conſiſted, that it was a working operative Faith; and really contained in it, a Conformity, and Submiſſion to the Will of God. If this is not his Meaning, this Inſtance of <hi>Abraham</hi> is Nothing to his Purpoſe. For the Point, that he is here la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring, is to ſhew, that <hi>Faith without Works is dead,</hi> and that it muſt include Obedience in it, in order to make it ſaving; and brings this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to prove it; and then concludes, hereb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

be to us; and that, as it is the Spirit, that animates, and enlivens the Body; <hi>even</hi> ſo it is Obedience that enlivens Faith, and renders it acceptable in the Sight of GOD.</p>
            <p>THIS great Truth, if there needs any Thing more to be ſaid upon it, may yet be abundantly confirmed by theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT the Scriptures <hi>univerſally</hi> make Obedience, and Holineſs of Heart and Life, <hi>abſolutely neceſſary</hi> to the Favour of GOD, and eternal Life. If you will ſearch the Scripture, you will find this to be the Language of the <hi>Old Teſtament. The Sacrifices of</hi> GOD <hi>are a broken Spirit. Who ſhall aſcend unto the Hill of the</hi> LORD, <hi>and ſtand in his holy Place? He that hath clean Hands, and a pure Heart. Fear</hi> GOD, <hi>and keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; for this is the whole Duty of Man. This Thing commanded I them, ſaying, obey my Voice, and I will be your</hi> GOD.<note n="*" place="bottom">Jer. vii 23.</note> 
               <hi>He hath ſhewed thee O Man, what is good, and what doth the</hi> LORD <hi>require of thee, but to do juſtly, and to love Mercy, and to walk humbly with your</hi> GOD?<note n="¶" place="bottom">Mich. vi. 9.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THE Language alſo of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> is the ſame. <hi>The Pure in Heart ſhall ſee</hi> GOD. <hi>To do good, and communicate are the Sacrifices with which</hi> GOD <hi>is well pleaſed. He that doth
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:008872_0039_10309210CEC8E980"/>
Righteouſneſs, is righteous even as</hi> GOD <hi>is righteous. Without Holineſs no Man ſhall ſee the</hi> LORD. <hi>The Unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of</hi> GOD. <hi>Neither ſhall any Thing enter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into, that defileth, or worketh Abomination, or maketh a Lie.</hi> Now when I read theſe peremptory Declarations, and conſider, that GOD is the <hi>ſame Yeſterday, to-day, and forever;</hi> that his Glory, and Man's true Happineſs is ever the ſame; that the Scriptures are all of a piece, and were indited by the ſame infalible Spirit of Truth; I ſay, when I conſider theſe Things, I muſt conclude, that Religion is the ſame in Subſtance, as ever it was; that Holineſs, and Righteouſneſs are abſolutely neceſſary to the Favour of GOD, and no Faith can be <hi>ſaving</hi> till it has ſomething of theſe divine Qualities in it.</p>
            <p>AND I am the more confirmed in this Opinion, when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe unchangeable Maxims, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Obligation of <hi>Obedience to</hi> GOD, <hi>reſults from our Relation to him,</hi> and can never ceaſe ſo long as that ſubſiſts. That <hi>Man's true Happineſs lies in the Enjoyment of his Maker;</hi> and <hi>a Conformity to him is abſolutely neceſſary in order thereunto. Agreeable</hi> hereunto the grand Plan formed in the divine Mind for his own Glory, and Man's Happineſs, was in the Way of our <hi>Obedience,</hi> Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and Holineſs. <hi>Theſe</hi> Things were eternally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to be the Foundation of our Enjoyment of GOD. The original Method propoſed for putting the ſame into Execution, was Man's <hi>perſonal,</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> Obedience to the Law: But this failing, thro' Man's Deficiency, opened the Way for the Goſpel Diſpenſation. Becauſe we are become weak by reaſon of Sin, and could not enter into Life by the Law; GOD in Mercy has interpoſed, and ſent his Son to undertake for us in this great Affair.</p>
            <p>AND now, is the divine Plan any ways altered? 'Tis true, the Manner of accompliſhing it is, but the Plan is the ſame. Is not a Conformity to GOD now as neceſſary to the Enjoyment of him as ever it was? Did'nt CHRIST come to reſtore in us the Image of GOD, that we have loſt?

            <p n="2">2. IF we conſider Faith as the <hi>Image</hi> of GOD upon the Soul, it lies in this divine Conformity.

So the Scripture repreſents it. <hi>Whoſoever believeth that Jeſus is the Chriſt is born of</hi> GOD.<note n="†" place="bottom">1 John v. 1.</note> And <hi>ſurely</hi> ſuch an One has the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Image upon him. By which I can underſtand Nothing elſe, but ſome Reſemblance of the divine Being; a Chriſt-like Temper, and Diſpoſition, an Imitation of him, and acting for ſuch-like Ends, and on ſuch-like Principles as he does. Now wherein does our Faith reſemble or imitate the divine Being? not in truſting, and believing the Truth: For theſe are Things incompatible with an Omniſcient, and powerful Being; and peculiarly to weak, and dependent Creatures. Neither are they any Participation of a divine Nature.</p>
            <p>BUT Love and Benevolence are divine Principles: do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing right and ſhewing Mercy, are <hi>God-like</hi> Actions; an Imitation of him in his moſt noble Perfections, yea in thoſe Things which he declares, are his Delight. And if there be any Thing, we may glory in, it is in this. <hi>Let not the wiſe Man glory in his Wiſdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his Might, let not the rich Man glory in his Riches: But let him that glorieth, glory in this, that he underſtandeth and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

This will be <hi>adorning</hi> the Doctrines of CHRIST; shining as Lights in the World; and more pleaſing to GOD, than whole burnt Offerings, or Thouſands of Rame and Ten Thouſand of Rivers of Oyl. Therefore, ſays the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, <q>Though I have the Gift of Propheſy, and underſtand all Myſteries, and all Knowledge; and tho' I have all Faith, ſo that I could remove Mountains, and have no Charity, I am Nothing.</q>

            <p n="3">3. IF we conſider Faith as our <hi>Union</hi> to CHRIST, or what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> wont to be called a <hi>Cloſing</hi> with him; it muſt lie in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and in divine Conformity. For there can be no Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before there is ſome Concord and Agreement. <hi>What Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip hath Righteouſneſs, with Unrighteouſneſs? What Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion hath Light with Darkneſs? And what Concord hath Chriſt with Belial?</hi> So alſo, if we conſider, as I have obſerved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that GOD'S Dealings with us, are in a covenant Way; CHRIST offers himſelf us on Goſpel Terms; that is, that he will become <hi>ours,</hi> if we will become <hi>his.</hi> Now believing and truſting in CHRIST, ſtrictly conſidered, is not a cloſing with this Offer; tho' theſe may be neceſſary pre-requiſites, and in <hi>Part</hi> thereof; yet do not come up to the Terms of the ſame. But it is yielding up ourſelves in Obedience to CHRIST, and to be <hi>his,</hi> that is, the Fulfilment of theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions: And when this is done, the Bargain is cloſed. The Believer is CHRIST'S, and CHRIST is the Believer's, by an everlaſting Covenant, that ſhall never be broken.</p>
            <p>THIS will appear very plain, if we conſider the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, the Scripture makes much uſe of, to ſet forth this divine Union by. And that is the <hi>Marriage</hi> Covenant. In Alluſion to which, it is ſaid to GOD'S People, <hi>Thy Maker
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:008872_0042_103092199CEE99D8"/>
is thine Huſband.</hi> And the Church is called the <hi>Spouſe,</hi> and the <hi>Lamb's Wife.</hi> In this Covenant, we all know, the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of Marriage muſt be made, and complied with; both Parties muſt covenant, and contract; the Man offers the Woman to be <hi>hers,</hi> and ſhe muſt give her Conſent to be <hi>his,</hi> before the Covenant is made, or ſhe can be intituled to his Eſtate. Again,</p>
            <p n="4">4. IF we conſider Faith as our <hi>Converſion</hi> to GOD, it lies in Holineſs and Obedience. Such is the Alienation of our Affections from GOD, and the Oppoſition of our Wills to him, by Reaſon of our Sins; that in order to a Reconciliation to him, the Scripture plainly intimates, that there muſt be a great Change wrought in us. <hi>Except ye be converted—ye ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
               <note n="¶" place="bottom">Mat. xviii. 3.</note> This Change the Scripture calls a <hi>New-Birth, a Reſurrection</hi> from the Dead, and a <hi>New-Creation.</hi> By all which is mean't nothing more or leſs, than a Change of our Affections from the World to GOD, or a being turned from the Ways of Sin to thoſe of Godlineſs. Now true Faith is this <hi>ſaving Change,</hi> ſo called; 'tis that by which we paſs from a State of Nature to a State of Grace: And ſo by the true Believer, and true Convert we mean One, and the ſame Perſon.</p>
            <p>THE Queſtion then is; what is it in Faith that is this Change? The Anſwer, is not believing and truſting in CHRIST for Salvation; for, as we have ſhewn before, a Man may do all this, and yet be attached to this Luſts. But it is his Conformity, and Obedience to GOD. And this will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by conſidering wherein all the Wickedneſs, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of the World, againſt GOD conſiſts; and that in one Word is their Non-conformity, and Diſobedience to his Law. For Sin is the Tranſgreſſion of the Law. And <hi>where no Law is, there is no Tranſgreſſion.</hi> GOD is never offended with any that have not broke his Laws. If ſo, that Man's Apoſtacy and Departure from GOD does lie in their Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to him, and Nothing elſe; then it follows that ſo
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:008872_0043_1030921C87EEF5C8"/>
long as they remain in a State of Diſobedience, there is not this Change in them; but they are in a State of Rebellion, as much as ever, and no more in a State of Reconciliation with GOD than the fallen Angels are.</p>
            <p>AND it as plainly follows that this Change and our Return to GOD can lie in Nothing ſhort of becoming obedient to him. If Diſobedience makes the Breach between GOD and Men; Nothing but Obedience can heal it; if the former puts us into a State of Rebellion; Nothing ſhort of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter can bring us into a State of Reconciliation again. You'll ſay, it may be, <q>By this Argument, a perfect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is now required of us, in Order to Acceptance with GOD.</q> I anſwer, No; but an upright and ſincere One is: And that will be accepted. For ſuch is the Grace of the Goſpel, thro' the Redemption of CHRIST, who has performed a perfect Obedience for us; that <hi>if there be a willing Mind, it is accepted according to that a Man hath, and not according to that he hath not.</hi>

               </note> Let me add,</p>
            <p>ONCE more, it is this View of Faith alone, that makes it <hi>honourable</hi> to God, and <hi>uſeful</hi> in this World. What honour to GOD is all the Faith of Devils? No more will be all the Faith of Men, without Obedience to him. To call CHRIST, LORD, and Maſter, and not to do his Will, is but an Affront to him, and mere Mockery in Religion. A free and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Obedience to his Commandments, is the greateſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that either Men or Angels can give to their Maker: Yea it is the ſincereſt Token of our Love, and the <hi>higheſt</hi> Acknowledgment of his Supremacy and Perfections that we are capable of making.</p>
            <p>SO alſo, of what Profit is all our Faith to our fellow Men, if it dont make us <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>righteous,</hi> kind and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, <hi>and exemplary</hi> for Piety and Holineſs in the World? Yea, Perſons making a Shew in Religion, pretending to have a Zeal for GOD, and Communion with him, when theſe Things are wanting, do but bring a <hi>Scandal</hi> on Religion, and expoſe themſelves to the <hi>Contempt</hi> and Railery of the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="unknown:008872_0044_1030921F69E72858"/>AGAIN, of what Advantage will all Faith be to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, if it don't humble our proud Hearts, mortify our Luſts and Paſſions, and bring us into an intire Subjection to JESUS CHRIST? No Doubt theſe are eternal Truths, <hi>viz. Obedience is better than Sacrifice, Rebellion is as the Sin of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft; and true Faith, is that Holineſs, without which no Man ſhall ſee the</hi> LORD. Tho' Heaven and Earth may paſs away, yet theſe ſhall abide forever and ever.</p>
            <p>THUS have I given you my Thoughts upon this great Article of our Religion. Therefore take your Bible, and look if they are not agreeable to the Scripture, reject them; but if they are, let no Bias, or Prejudice keep you from embracing them.</p>
            <p>AND now I beg your Patience a few Minutes longer, while I add two or three Things more, as follows;</p>
            <p n="1">1. BY this Diſcourſe I would not be underſtood, <hi>in the leaſt</hi> to intimate, that there is any Merit in our Works of Righteouſneſs; or that Obedience, as diſtinguiſhed from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, is the whole of the Goſpel Religion; or to caſt the leaſt Slight on the Redemption of CHRIST, or the Duties of believing, and truſting in him, as tho' they were not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation. For I fully believe, theſe Things ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to eternal Life; that it is, <hi>by Grace we are Saved;</hi> that our Acceptance of GOD is for the Sake of, and thro' the Redemption of CHRIST, and that believing, and truſting in him, is neceſſary in Order hereunto.</p>
            <p>BUT what I would, is, that all this falls ſhort of the Mark the Goſpel aims at; 'tis not the cloſing with CHRIST the Goſpel means; but one Thing needful is yet behind, that is, the Image of GOD as a divine Conformity. This is the grand Point and main Thing; <hi>without which no Man ſhall ſee the</hi> LORD. This is the Thing ſinful Men want; for this End CHRIST came into the World; the Goſpel was given; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving and Truſting in CHRIST were inſtituted as Means, <hi>even</hi> to reſtore this Image of GOD in the Soul. Now if this is not done, the End of the Goſpel is no ways anſwered; CHRIST has died in vain, <hi>your Faith is vain, and ye are yet in yours Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="unknown:008872_0045_10309222A22DCD38"/>HERE you may aſk, "Is not this a <hi>legal</hi> Way of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation?" I anſwer, <hi>legal</hi> or <hi>illegal</hi> it matters not; if it be the Way the Goſpel eſtabliſhes, and CHRIST, and his Apoſtles preached up. Yet there is a wide Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; by the Law, a Man was to be juſtified by his own Righteouſneſs; by the Goſpel, 'tis by, or through the Righteouſneſs of <hi>Another:</hi> By the former, a perfect Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was required; by the latter a ſincere one is accepted thro' the Righteouſneſs of CHRIST. But a <hi>Principle</hi> of Obedience, a <hi>divine Conformity</hi> is abſolutely neceſſary to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with GOD under all Diſpenſations. Can it poſſibly be otherwiſe? Are there any Contraries in Nature greater than Sin and Holineſs? Can a <hi>Swiniſh</hi> Nature, whoſe whole Delight is in the Filth of Sin, reliſh the <hi>pure</hi> Joys Heaven? Can an holy GOD delight in Sin, or approve of it? And a Devil or a Murderer be received to Glory, before he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and ſanctified? If this could be, <hi>ſurely</hi> there was no Neceſſity of CHRIST'S Redemption, or the Gift of the <hi>Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> to ſanctify and fit us for Glory.</p>
            <p>NO more can any One be purified in the Sight of GOD; the Meaning of which is, approved and accepted as righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous by him, without ſome Thing of this divine Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. This is a Conſequence ſo clear, from the foregoing Premiſes, that it is not eaſily denied; yet ſo contrary to the <hi>Antinomian</hi> Notion, that a little to evade the former and ſupport the latter; a ſubtil Diſtinction, has been made by Some, between the <hi>Right of Heirſhip,</hi> or a Title to eternal Life, and the <hi>Right of Fitneſs,</hi> or a Qualification for the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it; and ſo they ſay, 'tis <q>Believing alone that juſtifies and gives the Title to the one, but 'tis Holineſs, that is the Fitneſs and Qualification for the other. That it is in this Caſe, as with a Child in Infancy; tho' by Birth he is an Heir to an Eſtate, yet it is unfit for actual Poſſeſſion, 'til he comes to Manhood. Even ſo One juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by Faith, is an Heir to eternal Life, but muſt be fitted by Holineſs, before he can enter thereinto.</q> An artful Device to ſupport an unſcriptural Doctrine! But has this Misfortune in it, that it no Ways ſerves the Purpoſe
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:008872_0046_10309226ED53BAB0"/>
for which it is deſigned. For the Reaſon why an Heir to an Eſtate, in his Minority can't inherit the ſame, is not, becauſe he wants a <hi>legal</hi> Fitneſs therefor, but becauſe of his <hi>natural</hi> Incapacity to improve it. So, not only the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon juſtified, but the greateſt Saint while in the Body, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for the actual Enjoyment of eternal Life; not becauſe he wants the moral, or the <hi>Goſpel</hi> Qualification; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Fleſh and Blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> Every One therefore, ſo ſoon as he is juſtified in the Sight to GOD, has this moral Qualification; and ſhould his earthly Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, that Moment be diſſolved, he would be fit to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into his Maſter's Joy. How plain is this, if you will but conſider, that a Man is juſtified either before any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Conformity, or afterwards? If before, then it follows, that a wicked Man, that hates GOD, and whom GOD hates, is yet approved, and accepted as righteous by him. An Inconſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency too great to be believed! But if 'tis afterwards, then the juſtified Perſon has the divine Image upon him, and ſuch an One is fitted for the Enjoyment of his Maker.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THIS View of Faith will help us to ſee the <hi>Harmony</hi> and <hi>Agreement</hi> that there is in the ſacred Scriptures, and reconcile the <hi>ſeeming</hi> Contradictions between the Preaching of CHRIST, and his Apoſtles; I ſay, ſeeming Contradictions; for I look upon it, they are only in Appearance, and not in Reality. And a little Attention to the Ambiguity of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in general, and in what a various Senſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture uſes theſe Words, <hi>Faith, Law, Works,</hi> and ſuch-like, will ſolve the whole Difficulty.</p>
            <p>YET a wide Difference is made by Some, if not a real Contradiction between them; and it is generally done in this Manner. Thro' too much Inattention to theſe Things, for Fear of ſlumbering on the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Error of ſeeking Salvation by the <hi>Works of the Law;</hi> and miſtaking the true Meaning of the Apoſtle's Arguments to confute the ſame; they take <hi>ſaving</hi> Faith to be a diſtinct Thing from Obedience, <hi>complete</hi> and <hi>entire</hi> without it; and that this is not to be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its Conſideration as <hi>ſuch.</hi> And now theſe Difficulties ariſe; <hi>Paul</hi> preaches up Juſtification by Faith, <hi>without Works.</hi> CHRIST makes <hi>Obedience</hi> to the Commandments abſolutely
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:008872_0047_10309229C9F30328"/>
neceſſary thereto. And <hi>James</hi> ſays, <hi>a Man is juſtified by Works, and not by Faith only.</hi> And upon the foregoing Suppoſitions, they are inextricable Ones too. For they ſet the Scripture at Variance with itſelf, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> againſt his Lord and Maſter, and againſt himſelf too. For there is not one ſacred Writer that expreſſes himſelf in <hi>ſtronger</hi> Terms for Obedience than he does, when he tells to this effect. <q>That in CHRIST JESUS Nothing avails, but a new Creature, or keeping the Commandments of GOD, and that all Faith without Charity is Nothing.</q>
            </p>
            <p>NOW to extricate themſelves from theſe Difficulties, they have ſuch-like Refuges as theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of our <hi>Juſtification</hi> before GOD, but <hi>James</hi> of our <hi>Juſtification</hi> before Men: That the Former ſpeaks of the Juſtification of a Sinner, but the Latter of the Juſtification of the Faith of a Believer. But to evince this, I believe, there needs a new Revelation, for I don't think the Bible gives the leaſt Hint of it. But what is worſe than all this, they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent JESUS CHRIST as a legal Preacher only, that he did not preach up the <hi>true Goſpel</hi> Way of Salvation, as his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles did afterwards; but preached up the Works of the Law, to prepare Men to receive it from them. A new Doctrine this! The Scripture tells us, CHRIST taught the Way of Life <hi>truly, Grace and Truth</hi> came by him, and that he preached the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> But theſe Men tell us, that he preached the Law, and not the true Goſpel. The Scripture tells us, <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt came to <hi>prepare</hi> the Way for CHRIST. But <hi>theſe</hi> in Effect, that He came to <hi>prepare</hi> the Way for his Apoſtles. No Wonder Men r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n upon ſuch Rocks and Shoals, when they leave the Light of divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, to be guided by that of their own Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings! For all theſe Difficulties ariſe not from the Scripture, but from a miſconſtruing the ſame. Only view Faith in this Light, as a Believing and Truſting in CHRIST, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Subjection to his Will; than which, I think, nothing is plainer from the Scripture; and all theſe Difficulties vaniſh at once; there's no Diſcord any where, the Goſpel and Epiſtles <hi>ſweetly harmonize,</hi> and teach the ſame Doctrines;
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:008872_0048_1030922C9DB82B68"/>
CHRIST as the <hi>wiſe Maſter</hi> Builder, has laid the Foundation, and his Apoſtles as Workers together with him, are build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereon.</p>
            <p n="3">3. IN this Light, ſaving Faith, Regeneration, and true Converſion (which are all, if not in a <hi>grammatical,</hi> yet in a <hi>religious</hi> Senſe, one and the ſame) appear <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible</hi> Things; natural and eaſy to be underſtood; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted to vulgar Capacities, as they were deſigned by the Goſpel. There is no Myſtery, nor any Thing unintel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible in them; but ſo plain, that he that runs may read them; and it ſeems no Perſon of competent Underſtanding, unprejudiced, and deſirous to know the Truth, could easily miſtake the true Meaning of them.</p>
            <p>And yet what a Mystery do ſome make of theſe Things! When they tell us, <q>That ſaving Faith, or true Converſion is a Thing <hi>altogether</hi> unintelligible to a natural Man; that ſuch an One can't underſtand it himſelf, and <hi>much leſs</hi> deſcribe it to Others, before he is <hi>ſpecially</hi> illuminated by the Spirit of GOD, and has true Grace wrought in his Soul; that ſuch are ignorant of the <hi>true</hi> Senſe of the Scriptures, and ſo unable to open the ſame to Others; and that in all ſpiritual Concerns, it is ſafer to apply to One that is converted, tho' of the <hi>meaneſt</hi> Capacity, for Direction; than to the <hi>wiſeſt</hi> and moſt learned Man in the Scriptures, that is not a true Convert.</q> A Notion, that is <hi>big</hi> with Inconſiſtencies, and embarraſſes Religion with <hi>inſuperable</hi> Difficulties.<note n="†" place="bottom">By this I don't mean in the leaſt to undervalue true Grace or ſaving Faith in JESUS CHRIST; for I eſteem it to be the moſt noble of divine Gifts the greatest Ornament of human Nature; and a moſt deſirable Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Ministers of the Goſpel, and all Profeſſors of Religion too.

For theſe may be the moſt dangerous Perſons, and whom above all others, we have Reaſon to fear, and ſhun upon this Account. So that this ſuppoſition is the direct Way to fruſtrate the very End of divine Revelation, and leave us wholly in the dark, and altogether at the Mercy of ſuch proud conceited Ones who are ready to ſay to others, <hi>Stand by your ſelves, for we are holier than you.</hi>

For it is all done in <hi>myſtical</hi> Language; too much like the <hi>antient</hi> and <hi>Heathen</hi> Mythology, by high Flights of Expreſſions, And Scripture Metaphors, ſuch as, the <hi>Turning from Darkneſs to Light. The Moving of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God on dry Bones. A new Birth, a new Creation,</hi> and <hi>a Reſurrection from the Dead.</hi> And from hence they infer, <q>That it is a miraculous Change in the Heart, wrought by the Almighty Power GOD; an Infuſion of a new Nature, and a divine Principle of Life and Action into them, that is altogether beyond the Reach of <hi>carnal</hi> Reaſon; and then they confidently conclude, that thoſe that are dead, or are yet unborn, can't underſtand theſe Things.</q>

            <p>THIS finiſhes the Deſcription of Faith, except it be to tell of ſome of the Effects thereof; and thus they leave this
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:008872_0050_10309232C8458DC0"/>
noble Topick far worſe, and more unintelligible than they found it.</p>
            <p>NOW what Inſtruction is there in all this? Or what Profit any Ways to Mankind? Methinks, It only tends to puzzle and confuſe Perſons' Notions of Faith, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; leaves them wholly in the Dark, that they know nothing what they are, and totally at a Loſs, where to go for Inſtruction. And theſe unhappy Conſequences naturally follow herefrom, viz. That People too generally are at a Loſs about their State and Condition <hi>God-ward,</hi> yet eaſy and quiet in their Ignorance.—To Some, theſe Things appear ſo <hi>ſhocking</hi> and contrary to Reaſon, that they are ready to give up all Revelation, to look upon its Religion as a Piece of <hi>Prieſtcraft</hi> only, and had rather turn <hi>Deiſts</hi> than embrace it.—There are Others of a warm Imagination, and a fond Conceit of themſelves, that by ſome Means or other, fancy that they have paſſed through this Change, and are the Children of GOD; yet the World have no other Evidence of it, but their bare Word; and that not much to be depended upon in any other Affairs.—And there are Some, that are the moſt humble and conſcientious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that have the beſt Character among their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours for holy Living; yet <hi>walk in Darkneſs,</hi> and live in Fear all their Days, that they are not <hi>born again.</hi> And all this, becauſe they are ſo puzzled about Faith and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and know not what it is. By theſe Means, it comes to paſs, that GOD'S own Children, are ſtarved, and <hi>their</hi> Bread, and that which is <hi>holy</hi> is given unto Dogs.</p>
            <p>BUT all this, notwithſtanding, if Perſons will only go to the Scripture, and take Faith to be, as 'tis there deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed, a believing the Doctrines of the Goſpel, truſting in CHRIST, and embracing his Religion, there is No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing myſterious, or hard to be underſtood in it; but 'tis ſo plain, that I may ſay in the Words of a great, and good Man. <q>I acknowledge, I have been ſome Times uneaſy and aſhamed, to hear a Divine of the <hi>proteſtant</hi> Church, tell his People, that <hi>Faith in Chriſt</hi> is a myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Thing; As though there was any Thing in the

Affair of human Life clearer than this Notion, <hi>viz.</hi> Upon a Sight of our Sins, and Weakneſs to help ourſelves; to commit ourſelves to CHRIST, by an humble Act of Truſt in him; complying with the appointed Methods of Relief in the Goſpel. 'Tis but as a Man ſenſible of Sickneſs, applies himſelf to a wiſe Phyſician, and truſts himſelf in his Hands to relieve him, complying, with the Remedies appointed, in Order to his Cure.</q>

            </p>
            <p>And,</p>
            <p>LASTLY. There is no juſt Cauſe from Reaſon or Scripture, for the <hi>loud Complaints</hi> that are among Some, againſt <hi>good Works,</hi> or the <hi>preaching up</hi> the ſame. But this moſt certainly ariſes from ſome other Quarter. To talk a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt evil Deeds, is <hi>in Deed,</hi> juſt and right; but to ſpeak againſt good Works, is ſinful and vile; and to do this out a Zeal for GOD is <hi>ſtrange</hi> and unaccountable; for this is to talk againſt Religion, and againſt the Author of it too.</p>
            <p>YET are there not many, who call themſelves Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that can't bear to hear the Name of good Works? And is it not, becauſe they don't like the Thing? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are frequently ſpeaking moſt diminutively of them. Yea, have not Some been ſo ſevere in theſe Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, as boldly to call them curſed Things? But what <hi>Wild fire,</hi> and raving Zeal is this! And where will it fly? For what are good Works, but <hi>right</hi> Actions, doing as we ought; obeying GOD'S Law, and conforming to his Will? To call theſe Things curſed, is to call the Law ſo, that requires them; and to do this, how far ſhort does it come of calling the Maker of it curſed alſo. To ſay the leaſt, what daring Wickedneſs is this! and ſhocking, when 'tis under a Cloak of Religion too! But in Imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of CHRIST, I can heartily pray, <hi>Father, forgive them, for</hi> I verily believe, <hi>they know not what they</hi> ſay, or <hi>do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NO more Reaſon is their for the great <hi>Out-cry,</hi> that many People make againſt the Preaching up Works, and the Duties of Obedience. If I am not <hi>much</hi> miſtaken,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:008872_0052_1030923882E637D0"/>
this is flung at the faithful Miniſters of JESUS CHRIST, by many Perſons, <hi>that they are legal Preachers only; that they neglect the Goſpel, and preach up only Works, and Nothing but Works.</hi> This I believe, is altogether a Miſrepreſentation; for I never heard any <hi>ſuch</hi> Preaching. But, that they preaching up the Neceſſity of a Goſpel Obedience, by Faith in the Redeemer, in Order to eternal Life, no Doubt it is true. And what every Miniſter ought, and I believe every faithful One will do. For this is the Example, that CHRIST and his Apoſtles have ſet before us, who have preached up this Doctrine, in as ſtrong Terms as ever I have heard any. Now is it a Crime to follow them? To build upon the Foundation they have laid? Or to try to imitate him, of whom it is ſaid, <hi>never Man ſpake like him?</hi> If this is to be vile, I am willing to be <hi>more vile</hi> ſtill.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE, for Perſons to cry out againſt theſe Things, is to talk againſt God, and CHRIST, and againſt his divine Inſtitutions. And whatever Cloak, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence Perſons may have therefor; yet it is actually eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſing the Devil's Cauſe, and openly oppoſing the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of CHRIST, and his Ambaſſadors in the main and principal Errand they are ſent into the World upon; which is to preach up Holineſs, and Obedience to GOD. This indeed is not the whole, but 'tis the <hi>main</hi> Buſineſs to carry on their Maſter's <hi>Deſigns</hi> againſt the Kingdom of Sin, and to break Men off from their Wickedneſs, and bring them into an Obedience to the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>THIS will appear, if we conſider, that this is the expreſs Inſtruction in their divine Commiſſion. <hi>Go teach all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons—teaching them to obſerve all Things whatſoever I have commanded you.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. xxviii. 20.</note> That is, to obſerve and do every Thing the Goſpel injoins upon us. If we also conſider, what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence our Works will have on our eternal State. <hi>Not the Hearers, but the Doers of the Law ſhall be juſtified.</hi> GOD <hi>will render to every Man according to his Deeds.</hi> And our
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:008872_0053_1030923C8F99D5E0"/>
               <hi>final</hi> Sentence at the Day of Judgment will be paſſed, and we <hi>doomed</hi> to Heaven or Hell, according as our Works have been Good or Evil, in this Life. Again, the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up Holineſs, and univerſal Obedience, as abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation; is the grand Engine of the Goſpel, and the moſt <hi>powerful</hi> Weapon, for the <hi>pulling down the ſtrong Holds</hi> of Sin. And there is Nothing in all the Goſpel Artillery, that will ſo gall, and vex the Enemy as this will. Wicked Men will bear any Doctrine of divine Revelation better than this; Nothing will wound them like it. Tell the Drunkard in plain Words, if he don't leave off his Cups, he'll certainly be <hi>damn'd.</hi> And there's not an Arrow in the Goſpel Quiver, that will ſtick in his Heart like it. When Paul <hi>reaſoned of Righteouſneſs, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and Judgment to come, Felix trembled.</hi> The Reaſon is, if this be the Caſe, they ha'nt a Spark of Hope left; <hi>beſure</hi> while they remain ſuch. Therefore, when Men are ſo attached to their Luſts, that 'tis like Death, to part with them, they can't bear ſuch Preaching. No Wonder then, they keep a continual Fire, and muſter up all their Strength againſt it.</p>
            <p>ONCE more, if we conſider, that this is the moſt <hi>need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> Preaching in a <hi>chriſtian</hi> Land, in general, and in <hi>ours</hi> in particular. Indeed the whole Counſel of GOD is to be preached up, and no part thereof to be kept back. But then, there are the <hi>greater,</hi> and <hi>leſſer</hi> Things under the Goſpel, as well as under the Law, and the former ſhould be the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Object of the Preacher's Attention. Next to this the <hi>State</hi> of Religion, or <hi>Growth</hi> of Wickedneſs is to be kept in view. For as one great End of all Preaching is to put down Sin; ſo it ſhould be principally levelled againſt thoſe Sins, that are moſt prevalent among a People. If it be open <hi>Infidelity;</hi> then that is to be encounter'd. This was the Caſe, when the Apoſtles were ſent forth into the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> World: Therefore they preached up Faith in CHRIST and embracing the Goſpel. Where I may obſerve, that when any renounced <hi>Heatheniſm,</hi> and declared their Belief of the Goſpel, and their embracing it, they were baptiſed. And
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:008872_0054_1030923E424905A0"/>
from that Time they were called <hi>Saints,</hi> and <hi>of the Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF it be <hi>Hereſy</hi> that is prevailing, then that is to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. Such was the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Error in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Time, when they were for bringing <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> and <hi>keeping the Law of Moſes,</hi> into the Goſpel Religion. Therefore the Apoſtle, to confute this Error, teaches, <hi>That a Man is not juſtified by the Works of the Law, but by the Faith of Chriſt.</hi> And if it be Diſobedience to GOD, <hi>Immorality</hi> or <hi>Profaneneſs,</hi> that is prevailing; then theſe Crimes are to be openly teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied againſt, and principally born down upon. Thus the Artillerly of the Goſpel ſhould always be turned and aim'd at the ſtrongeſt Force, and principal Batteries of the Enemy.</p>
            <p>THIS was the univerſal Practice of CHRIST and all the <hi>inſpired</hi> Teachers, to adapt their Diſcourſes to the <hi>Times,</hi> Occaſions and particular Circumſtances of their Hearers. And why ſhould it not be ſo now? What then muſt be the main Drift of our Preaching at the preſent Time? This will be determined by the Sins, that are prevalent in the Land. Well then, What are theſe? Not open <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity.</hi> The Land is become <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> and People gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally receive the goſpel Revelation; neither is it call'd in Queſtion. For my Part, I don't know of a <hi>Deiſt</hi> in the Land. Is there ſo <hi>much</hi> Need then of preſſing that which every One believes?</p>
            <p>AGAIN. Are there any <hi>Hereſies</hi> prevailing in the Land; by which, I mean, a Denial, or not owning any of the fundamental Doctrines of the Goſpel? I know of none.<note n="*" place="bottom">Except by Hereſy, we mean every Thing has is wrong and Sinful: ſuch as Ignorance of the Scriptures; all Miſtakes about the Meaning of particular Texts; every different Sentiment, even in the leſſer Matters of Religion; and all Immorality, and Ungodlineſs. But in this Senſe I dont underſtand it; but take it (in the Senſe that Eccleſiaſtical Uſage has fixed on this Term) to mean ſuch perveſe Opinions, as tend to overthrow and lap the Foundations of the Goſpel Religion. And by it, here I mean, thoſe in particular, that ſome have been ſuſpicious, are growing and increaſing among us, <hi>viz. Deiſm, Aarin, So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="55" facs="unknown:008872_0055_1030923FEBBBBD60"/>
Indeed I can't promiſe for every Individual, but believe that the People are generally <hi>orthodox</hi> and <hi>ſound in the Faith.</hi> 'Tis true, there has been ſome Fears, and Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies; and the Watchmen upon our Walls <hi>do well</hi> to keep a good Look out; and warn the People of all approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Danger. Accordingly ſome Alarms have been made; and this <hi>ſpecial</hi> Service has been done by it: That People are waked up; put upon their Guard, and ſtrict En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition has been made; but they have found none. So that I'm not apprehenſive of <hi>ſo much</hi> Danger from this Quarter.</p>
            <p>WHAT is the Wickedneſs then, that is prevailing? Is it not as clear as the Sun? 'Tis now with us, as GOD told the Prophet; <hi>They hear thy Words, but they will not do them.</hi>
