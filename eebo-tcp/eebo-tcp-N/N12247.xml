            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THAT a mean and <hi>invidious</hi> ſet of men have look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon my elevation to the rank of DIRECTOR-GENERAL AND PHYSICIAN IN CHIEF, with an <hi>evil eye,</hi> and long been concerting <hi>my removal,</hi> is a matter of which I have too ſubſtantial proof to doubt: That the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied pains I have taken to ſupport oeconomy, regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity and order, ſo far as they had been introduced into the department, before it came under my management; to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce, recommend and inforce them, where wanting; and to oppoſe and reform abuſes that were creeping, or had already crept into it, from the infancy of the ſervice, were the root of the enmity which ſprung up againſt my proceedings, are no leſs certain. It is equally evident that it received its growth and vigour from my inflexible reſolution of being faithful to my truſt, in not ſuffering, ſo far as it was in my power to prevent, the diſſipation of the ſtores entruſted to me, for the uſes of the ſick that ſhould be ſent to the General Hoſpital under my care, by expoſing them to the waſte and depredation of men whoſe ſchemes tended to the ſubverſion of the General Hoſpital, in which they laboured to raiſe themſelves into an importance, which neither the General nor Congreſs ever intended, and from my putting a ſtop to thoſe abuſes of which too many of them had been guilty. That theſe are the ſtock from whence have ſhooted thoſe cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, againſt me, which have been ſo carefully culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, with a deſign to injure my character with the publick, under a pretence of intereſting them in the ſufferings of the ſick, to which the imprudences of others had given riſe; and to ſhift the blame from them on me, I doubt not will appear to the full conviction of every impartial perſon, who has patience to attend to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Letters, Narrative, Proofs and Illuſtration of facts, which I propoſe to lay before them.</p>

               <pb n="V" facs="unknown:015447_0003_0F998141A45F7E30"/>
But that my enemies ſhould be able, with all the arts of malice, to have influenced Congreſs to proceed to my diſmiſſion, on their partial reports, is what I had no thoughts they would have been ſo bold, or ſo baſe, as to attempt; nor if they had, could I have imagined that they would have ſucceeded in their attempt.</p>
            <p>The manner in which I have conducted myſelf in the General Hoſpital department; my ſtrict obſervance of the reſolves of Congreſs; my vigilance, care and activity in the duties of my ſtation; the ſeveral plans I deviſed for putting it in the power of Congreſs, conſiſtently with their own original ſchemes of oeconomy, to make a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proviſion for the rigimental Surgeons and ſick, as well as for the General Hoſpital itſelf; the advices I have communicated from time to time to ſeveral of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, concerning the ſtate and wants of the ſick, and of the regimental Surgeons; the evils I have foretold were likely to enſue, and the remedies I pointed out in time to prevent many of them; and laſtly, the toils and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to which I have continually expoſed myſelf in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of my truſt, I concluded would always be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ſhield to protect me from every aſſault, till I could have notice of the deſigns and movements of my enemies, been prepared for my defence, and have had time to have repelled them. Thoſe inſtances of zeal, diligence and uprightneſs of conduct, I hoped, were ſuch, as neither malice could ſcandalize, nor envy miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intrepret.</p>
            <p>Will it be believed in a future day, that ſo grave and illuſtrious a ſet of men, as compoſe the American Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, ſhould, on any partial repreſentation, without giving the perſon accuſed an opportunity of exculpating himſelf from the charges brought againſt him, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

What reparation can be made for ſuch a haſty judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if it is found to be ſo? Can any future inquiry into the merits of the cauſe wholly extinguiſh its fatal influence? Is there a tribunal in the world that has paſt ſentence without a trial, that one may pronounce a proper tribunal, to which an innocent man may ſafely appeal? The higher the tribunal, the more fatal is the influence of prejudices. Has not the part the Congreſs has taken, in my diſmiſſion, a direct tendency to weaken and corrupt the proper evidences? Can witneſſes that might be called in be ſo impartial, as to give a full and faithful teſtimony in favour of the accuſed perſon? Will they readily produce ſuch proofs in his favour as they could do, that might tend to applaud his conduct, whom Congreſs, by a reſolve, has thought fit to cenſure; eſpecially when thoſe witneſs have their reliance on that Court, for preſent rank and future promotions? Is there a more effectual bribe to ſtop the mouths of evidences in favour of an innocent man, and to raiſe up enemies againſt him? How unhappy then muſt be the ſituation of any one, which lays him under ſo great an inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, that thoſe who have it in their power to juſtify his conduct, may be intimidated from doing it, fully and freely, as they wiſh to do, for fear of giving offence to thoſe on whom they are dependants; ſo that it is eaſier for thoſe who incline to it, to do an innocent perſon a miſchief, than to find many men ſo juſt, as to produce all they know in his behalf, and, by vindicating him, incur the disfavour of thoſe in power?</p>
            <p>Under thoſe circumſtances a man's defence muſt be liable to miſconſtructions; whereas, had an inquiry been allowed, before diſmiſſion, full weight would have been given to the evidences on both ſides; but by this ſummary and unuſual proceeding, is not the door ſhut againſt impartial juſtice; and ſhould the perſon be called to trial, before the Bench that condemned him, are not his Judges become a party againſt him? In whoſe favour they are likely to paſs judgment, on reference, let the feelings of mankind determine!</p>

Notwithſtanding I was fully ſenſible of the force of theſe reaſonings, yet ſo conſcious was I of my innocence, and ſuch was my opinion of the incorruptibility of the Congreſs, that, rather than lay under an imputation that affected my character, dearer to an honeſt man than life itſelf, on the firſt notice of my removal from office, I immediately appealed to the Commander in Chief and to Congreſs, in hopes they would reconſider what had been ſo haſtily done againſt me. Three months are elapſed ſince that appeal, nor have they thought ſit to give me any anſwer.</p>
            <p>To what other cauſe can I impute it but their own reflexions, that there is not a ſet of men on earth, ſo free from the influence of their own paſſions, that a perſon may truſt himſelf to their deciſions, unheard, and to whom it is proper to appeal from their own deciſions, thus made? For who are ſo free from biaſs, as not to have a ſecret wiſh to find, that, in paſſing judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they were juſt. Can it be their deſire to find that man blameleſs, to whom they have behaved, as if they thought him otherwiſe? Would it not be a reflexion on their haſty judgment, when they have treated him, as guilty, to find him wholly innocent?</p>
            <p>But I will not do that Honourable Body the injuſtice to entertain a ſuſpicion ſo derogatory to them, as to conſider my diſmiſſion, and the manner of it, as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, deliberate act of the Whole Body, or what they approved. I have heard it alledged, in their defence, againſt ſo injurious a ſuppoſition, that many of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

Theſe conſiderations have induced me to print ſuch an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my proceedings, a may enable them, and the publick, to ſee with clearneſs, and judge with conviction, on the propriety or impropriety of my conduct; and to put it in their power to condemn, or acquit me, on ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient evidence.</p>
            <p>To ſuppoſe, as ſome have been inclined to think, that Congreſs can object to this appeal, from their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to that of the publick, would be a greater reflex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, in my opinion, on their juſtice, and do more inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to that veneration we are bound to pay their virtue and wiſdom, than I think any Advocate of Liberty will date to offer ſo reſpectable a Senate Would it not be incompatible with every idea of that liberty and juſtice for which America is now in arms, to diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Without this is allowed, all our priviledges are but an empty boaſt, "<hi>the baſeleſs fabrick of a viſion,,</hi>" to which we are ſacrificing the moſt ſubſtantial realities.</p>
            <p>Out of reſpect to Congreſs. I have thus long deferred my application to the publick. I can no longer, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently with my reputation, defer it. The wounds that are given by the envenomed tongue of calumny are deeper, and more fatal than the ſword; they deſtroy what is dearer than life, reputation and peace of mind; blemiſhes on a man's public character ſoon feſter, and if not ſpeedily removed, will contaminate every thing about him, and infect the very air he breathes. He whoſe
<pb n="X" facs="unknown:015447_0007_0F998144110358C0"/>
reputation is injured, is ever ſuſpected; his ſociety is ſhunned; he is looked upon as dangerous, as a walking peſtilence. I muſt not therefore paſs over, in ſilence, a proceeding which ſtrikes ſo home at my honour. It would afford room for ingenious architects to raiſe a pile of plauſible charges, which ſilence is no ways calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to refute. Evil reports are apt to ſpread like wild fire, and even perſons not eaſily inclined to it, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating and circulating a ſtory, ſnow ball it from hand to hand, whence it cannot fail to accumulate; and where ſlanders have been ſuffered to take root, there are never wanting ſome perſons, who will uſe all kinds of manure to quicken the growth. And though my Friends are diſpoſed to look upon me as an innocent and injured perſon, yet I do not deſire that they, or the world, ſhould ſet down ſatisfied with a bare preſumption of my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, as my enemies have with that of my guilt. I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wiſh them to unite, in calling on me, to perſiſt in dragging from their dark retreats, and chaining down thoſe barking CERBERI, thoſe peſts of ſociety, who lay in wait to prey on the reputation of others; and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in laying open my conduct, and their evil machina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſo long as any doubt remains of either, and the means of obtaining and communicating evidence on the facts, are within my power.</p>
            <p>Before I enter upon the taſk, may I be permitted, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence, to guard againſt a miſtake that ſome may, perhaps, otherwiſe fall into. They may ſuppoſe, from the pains I am taking to vindicate myſelf from ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs imputations, that I wiſh, or aim to be reſtored, the place from which I have been removed; and that I ought rather, on the firſt appearance of the injuſtice done me, to have reſigned my commiſſion, by which I might have freed myſelf from much trouble, and have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided the public diſcred it of being removed from it. After I have given ſuch evidence, as I have done, of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs with which I conſented to ſerve my Country, at the firſt call, as a proof of my principles, and of my
<pb n="XI" facs="unknown:015447_0007_0F998144110358C0"/>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the very firſt intimation I ever received of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints made to Congreſs, I called for an immediate hearing. The honourable Member who informed me of them, gave me a hint of reſignation being the moſt adviſeable ſtep to be taken, in the like circumſtances, to quiet thoſe clamours. Could I have firſt vindicated my innocence. I ſhould have reſigned with pleaſure, for I had not the remoteſt wiſh to continue in an office that was ſo intolerably burdenſome, when there was ſuch want of diſcipline to inforce thoſe regulations, which both the Congreſs and Commander in Chief thought were beſt; nor did I think a ſervice that, for want of diſcipline and ſuitable proviſion, was in a ſtate of the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt anarchy and confuſion, ſo very honourable, as to have a deſire to remain in it, one moment longer, than by ſo doing I could be uſeful to my Country.—But had I reſigned, before I had been favoured with an examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into my conduct, it might rather have prepoſſeſſed the world with an opinion, that there was ſome ground for thoſe clamours againſt me, of which I was no ways conſcious. I determined, therefore, to inſiſt on an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into my conduct, and having fully vindicated it, to have cloſed with their permiſſion to reſign, had it been allowed me to do ſo.</p>
            <p>I ſhould then have rejoiced to have eſcaped from that ſcene of confuſion to which I had been ſo long a witneſs, and in which I could not be uſeful, to my former ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in private life. On this ground I conſider my diſmiſſion, not only as more honourable than a reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without a previous juſtification of my conduct, but than a continuance in office, under the circumſtances I have been in, almoſt ever ſince I accepted that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. But I particularly rejoice in it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> affords me an opportunity of vindicating my conduct, not only to the Whole Congreſs, but to the Whole World, and
<pb n="XII" facs="unknown:015447_0008_0F998144ACBCA300"/>
having done it, I leave the event to that God who rules the world, and in whoſe hands are all our ways.</p>
            <p>Every thing I deem neceſſary, at preſent, for my full juſtification, is contained in the following letter to a friend at Philadelphia, my memorial to General Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, and the letters and reſolves of Congreſs, with the proofs and illuſtrations that are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined in the appendix. I ſhall make no other apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for laying them before the publick in that form and order, than that I think them the beſt adapted to give both Congreſs, and the publick, full information of the nature of my conduct; and if, in the courſe of my narrative, the facts I adduce, and the remarks which ariſe upon them, ſhould ſeem to glance obliquely on any particulars, I hope I may be allowed to plead that the treatment I have met with, and the nature of my vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, requires freedom, and that I ſhall be excuſed in the eye of reaſon, and with every candid mind, if I do not ſmother the truth and thereby weaken my defence, merely to avoid giving pain to any.</p>

I then promiſed to lay before the publick, a faithful and exact account of every proceeding, relative to the diſcharge of my duty in the above ſtation, by which the world would be enabled to judge whether the charges were well ſounded, or only proceeded from a ſpirit of malignity and detraction.</p>
                  <p>In the papers of the 17th, I communicated the reſult of that examination, with a letter, calling upon the author of the report, concerning the removal of the medicines, to know what he had to offer; to which he returned a ſhort evaſive anſwer, diſclaiming the charge, which is there publiſhed, together with a full account of the tranſaction.</p>
                  <p>In that paper the public were informed, that in reſpect to the removal of the drugs, medicines and ſhop furniture in queſtion, I had the order of General Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, in writing, for what I did, backed with a reſolve of the Council and Aſſembly of the State of Maſſachuſetts-Bay, after a ſequeſtration of the property of thoſe perſons;—that they were removed to New-York, for the uſe of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,—that whatever was done by me, in this affair, was merely official;—that an inventory of the whole was left with the Boſton Committee, that in caſe the former owners ſhould return to town, and be entitled to claim a reſtitution of their effects, the value might be duly aſcertained;—that a particular and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful account of every thing done in this buſineſs, was tranſmitted to the Adjutant General, to be laid before the Commander in Chief, for which I received thanks for the matter and manner of what I had done;—and that an inventory of every hoſpital ſtore, remaining on hand, being made out by the Apothecary of the General Hoſpital, with care and exactneſs, was tranſmitted to General Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington and the Congreſs, of which I kept an authentic copy; concluding this head with an addreſs to thoſe perſons, to take ſhame and confuſion of face to themſelves, who, judging only from the corruption of their own hearts, appear to think it impoſſible for men, to whom much is entruſted, to keep free from that pollution of hands, which they find in themſelves ſuch a proneneſs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.</p>

            <p>You would comfort me with this true obſervation, that "it is not for men in public ſtations, in times like theſe,
<pb n="XV" facs="unknown:015447_0009_0F9981456CD27CC0"/>
to expect to be free from cenſure, nor ſhould they be diſcouraged at the obloquies, with which ſome men wiſh to ſtain their characters; they ought to content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with this remark, that men of worth, who are not only innocent, but whoſe conduct is meritorious, are moſt liable to be traduced by ignorant and deſigning men; that not <hi>to meet with envy</hi> and <hi>back-biting,</hi> is a <hi>frequent effect</hi> of <hi>compliances,</hi> which argue, a <hi>weakneſs</hi> unworthy of <hi>confidence;</hi> that my friends know I do not wiſh to be <hi>popular</hi> at ſuch a <hi>price,</hi> but have rather court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſlanders of the <hi>envious,</hi> by a ſteady perſeverance in my duty, than lay a train for the compliments of <hi>flatterers,</hi> by favouring their <hi>dark purpoſes.</hi>"</p>

            <p>You ſay you are convinced, that what I wrote to you of my ſuſpicions, was true; "that this cry againſt me is owing to my ſteadineſs to diſcharge the truſt repoſed in me, according to the beſt of my judgment, knowledge and abilities, and in not yielding to the repeated at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of ignorant or bad men, to encroach upon my department, who wiſhed that I would iſſue all expenſive ſtores to their orders, without their being accountable for them, contrary to my inſtructions, by which they would be expoſed to rapine and diſſipation, without a poſſibility of replacing them, and my character juſtly ſuffer for ſubmitting to an unlicenſed prodigality and breach of duty and orders. You obſerve that mine "is not the only inſtance of a man's reputation being offered up a victim to the ignorance or ambition of others."</p>
            <p>You tell me you now ſee clearly, what I had often told you before, and have now experienced to my coſt:" That it is no eaſy matter for a perſon, placed at the head of any department, that requires a ſtrict and wary atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not to be borne down by ignorant or deſigning

TO INCAPACITATE, in this manner, is no ſuch ſmall puniſhment, that a man may eaſily endure, though he be innocent.

                  <p>I am well informed, by a gentleman of unqueſtionable honour and veracity, and who had ſeen his letter to Dr. SHIPPEN, about the ſame time, that his addreſs to him was, to Dr. SHIPPEN, "Director-General, &amp;c." "A word to the wiſe."</p>
               </note> Inſtead of making his reports to me, as Director-General, as had been formerly ordered, by a Reſolve of Congreſs, July 17, we were both to make our reports to Congreſs. I was ordered to eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh an Hoſpital, at a proper diſtance from camp, for the army poſted on the Eaſt ſide of the North-River, when there was no convenience for doing it on that ſide, at any ſuitable diſtance, being hemmed in by the two rivers, and the enemy's forces, on either ſide. He was to eſtabliſh an Hoſpital in the Jerſeys, on the Weſt of Hudſon's-River, and to direct it, where alone any ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble accommodations could be provided for the ſick, with any the leaſt regard to the convenience of the army, or the preſervation of the ſick. Here almoſt the whole of the Hoſpital ſtores and medicines were lodged, and near one half of the Hoſpital Surgeons and Mates of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment were; as well as all the wounded brought from Long-Iſland, and the ſick of the General Hoſpital at
<pb n="XXII" facs="unknown:015447_0013_0F998148AFAB7208"/>
New-York, who, as the object of my peculiar care, were conveyed to the Jerſies, for their greater ſafety and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter accommodation.</p>
            <p>At this very juncture, it was the General's pleaſure that I ſhould proceed to Hackinſack, on the Weſt ſide of the river, to eſtabliſh other hoſpitals for the increaſing ſick. I applied to him, to know in what light I was to conſider thoſe reſolves; and whether, conſiſtently with them, I could continue to eſtabliſh hoſpitals, or provide for the ſick, that ſhould be carried from the Eaſt to the Weſt ſide of the river, ſo that they ſhould remain under my own care and ſuperintendence, or whether I was not by thoſe reſolves to be deprived of the only hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals I had, that were fit for the accommodation of the ſick and wounded, and of the principal hoſpital ſtores <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>But General Waſhington and General Green, who was preſent, gave it as their opinion, that the reſolves of Congreſs extended only to diſtinguiſh the two armies, for which ſeparate hoſpitals were to be eſtabliſhed; that I was directed to eſtabliſh one for the ſick and wounded of General Waſhington's army, that was poſted on the Eaſt ſide of Hudſon's-River; and that the other gentleman was to take care of the ſick of the flying camp, and ſuch other of the troops, as happened to be then on the Eaſt ſide of the North-River, which was only a temporary ſtation. This view of matters, in ſome meaſure, compoſed my apprehenſions at that time. I was unwilling to admit the ſuppoſition that Congreſs, which, I was bound to think, wiſhed order and ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to be kept up in every department of the army, intended that he ſhould interfere with my power, and ſuperior appointment of Director-General, though, for the ſake of preſent convenience, he might be ordered to
<pb n="XXIII" facs="unknown:015447_0013_0F998148AFAB7208"/>
make his report directly to Congreſs. I therefore conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as well from the conſtruction put upon it by the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, as from the reaſonableneſs of the thing itſelf, that I was not prohibited from fixing hoſpitals, either on the eaſt or weſt ſide of the river, as beſt anſwered for the army poſted on the eaſt ſide. I could not conceive that the lives of the men, that compoſed that army, were to be ſacrificed, by a limitation of the place in which they were to be taken care of, or that a plan was laid for reducing me to a mere cypher, and to throw the whole power of the department into the hands of an inferior officer, as Doctor Shippen certainly was, however he might affect an equality.</p>
            <p>Agreeable to this inference, I repaired to Hackinſack, by the General's order, to direct the neceſſary proviſion to be made, for the reception and accommodation of the ſick, from York iſland, and directed a ſecond diviſion of the Hoſpital Surgeons, of my immediate department, to attend, and take the care of them.</p>
            <p>Although I never was allowed to be abſent from the army, and ſcarcely permitted to be at any diſtance, for the ſhorteſt time, from Head-Quarters; yet the great weight of providing for, and taking care of the ſick of the whole army, reſted on my ſhoulders alone; and yet my hands were ſo tied up by reſolves of Congreſs, and general orders, as to leave little freedom for proper ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions. In particular, I had no Deputy or Aſſiſtant under me, to ſhare any part of the burden of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, however extenſive. One Surgeon and five Mates were all that had been allowed me, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to this time, for every five thouſand men; when at leaſt one thouſand men, in every five, were ſometimes conſidered as unfit for duty. And though I was called upon, as if I was a Commiſſary, to attend to the daily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion returns of all the ſick in the army, ſpread thro many miles, not only of the hoſpital, but the regimental ſick, and to provide them with accommodations, as a Barrack-Maſter, and with hoſpital furniture, as a Quarter-Maſter,
<pb n="XXIV" facs="unknown:015447_0014_0F998149E3664D38"/>
and that, contrary to the reſolves of Congreſs (ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and unreaſonable were the Regimental Surgeons, and even ſome of the militia Generals, in requiring it) yet I had no other aid, than what could be afforded me by thoſe gentlemen, who had only the rank and pay of Hoſpital Surgeons, but who were obliged to do the duty of Deputy Directors, for which I wiſhed them to be cloathed with more power, than they were entitled to, when acting under the ſimple commiſſion of Surgeons.</p>
            <p>Perhaps artful men may here alledge, that I ought, therefore, to have ſubmitted to the difficulty, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged my care of the ſick, of the army, on the weſtern Director. I would aſk them for what purpoſe, whether to bury him with the load, when he could no more take care of the ſick of the flying camp only, than I could of the whole army, unleſs by depriving me of my own offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and ſtores; or was it, to reduce me to a cypher, in order to raiſe him into importance? Had the Congreſs ſuppoſed that I had too much, and he too little to do, I would cheerfully have transferred to him the ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendence, and management of as many, as his heart deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, only reſerving my rank, and the command of my own officers, hoſpitals and ſtores. But I have good grounds to believe, that his underhand attempts to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere with me, in my department, and his intereſt with a partirular ſet, which has been employed to effect my removal, with a view to promote his deſign of ſucceeding me, have operated more powerfully to accompliſh it, than all others, that have been held up, as the oſtenſible cauſes of my removal; which, however he may think, from being tranſacted behind a curtain, they lye conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, can be eaſily traced to their author, and are of a tiſſue with the reſt of his conduct towards me, on ſimilar occaſions.</p>
            <p>But whilſt I was left deſtitute of help, what aſſiſtance was allowed, in the mean while, to the Director of the flying camp? I was well aſſured, from his own lips, that he had not long acted in that ſtation, before he waſ
<pb n="XXV" facs="unknown:015447_0014_0F998149E3664D38"/>
complimented with the appointment of a deputy, having the rank, title and pay of Aſſiſtant-Director, or, as he told me, however ſtrange and inconſiſtent it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, of Aſſiſtant-Director-General. Thus it fares with the man, I will not ſay as Hamán did, whom the king delights to honour; but whom governing connexions chuſe to make conſiderable, at the expence of others.</p>
            <p>However this was effected, whether by his own fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt, or that of his friends, will any man pretend to ſay that this appointment, and the manner of wording the reſolves of Congreſs, October 9th, did not ſerve the purpoſes of neſt eggs, on which to brood and hatch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, not thought of by Congreſs, as a body? What will indifferent men think of theſe reſolves, ſo contrary to my commiſſion of Director-General, October 17, 1775, and the report of Congreſs, Auguſt 20th, to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſh my rank beyond diſpute? See the appendix, page 30.</p>
            <p>Whilſt ſuch an auxiliary appointment is made to give weight and importance to a temporary Director of a fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing camp; and reſolves procured afterwards, to raiſe him to greater importance, and to bring me down to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Is it not manifeſt, that the Director and his attachments, have, from his firſt coming into the ſervice, purſued ſuch meaſures, as they conceived were beſt calculated to raiſe him over the ſhoulders of every man who ſtood in his way, and to conſtitute him Head of the depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

<pb n="XXVII" facs="unknown:015447_0015_0F998149EA144B08"/>
ſhall produce ſuch circumſtances, as, I truſt, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince impartial men, that the oſtenſible cauſes of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, were not the true ones; and that Congreſs had, in fact, no well grounded charge, to juſtify the meaſure, which ſome perſons were ſo reſolutely bent upon, as to be afraid, if I were admitted to an hearing, their deſigns, of effecting my removal, would have been fruſtrated. I think the one I have already pointed out will be found, on an impartial inquiry, to be the <hi>conditio ſine qua non;</hi> or rather, the efficient cauſe of that event; I mean that I ſtood in the way of an ambitious man, whom his adherents determined, be the conſequences what they might, to raiſe to the firſt rank in the depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and either oblige me to bend, as a reed, before him, or, like a ſtubborn oak, to be torn up by the roots, for reſiſting the tempeſt; and to plant him on my ruin.</p>
            <p>I had intimations given me, more than once, that pains would be taken, to deprive me of my rank and diſtinction, to make room for a riſing competitor. I did not readily believe, yet did not wholly diſcredit the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence. I wrote to ſome members of Congreſs, whom I looked upon as my friends, to guard againſt any ſtep, which, through ſeeming inattention to military rules, might make it impracticable, conſiſtent with thoſe rules, as a man of ſpirit, to remain in the ſervice. I told them I did not ſeek for any extent of power, nor was I averſe to any limitation of it, in my own caſe, compatible with that ſenſe of honour, which is ſuppoſed neceſſary to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate and quicken men, in every army. I did not know, till I received a letter from the Secretary of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, to rectify that miſtake, that rank, precedence and honour, are all nonſenſe, and not looked for in our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and truly, if we may judge from effects, they carry too much conviction, that a ſenſe of honour is no virtue, in his eſtimation, whatever it may be in that of ſome men, of a more liberal way of thinking, both in Congreſs and in the army. I took the liberty to write to the Preſident of the Congreſs, himſelf, "that I hoped there would be
<pb n="XXVIII" facs="unknown:015447_0016_0F9981504F5F64F0"/>
no unneceſſary abridgement of rank and authority in my perſon, whilſt I continued in office, that was neceſſary for the head of the department, in the perſon of my predeceſſor, and was conſiſtent with real uſefulneſs, to which I expreſſed it to be my deſire, that every other conſideration ſhould give way, as it would imply a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion upon me, which I was unwilling to ſuppoſe I merited."</p>
            <p>I alſo wrote to the Secretary of Congreſs, on a double account; firſt, to know the extent of my power, and that of the ſeveral Directors, for the ſake of conducting buſineſs in its proper channel; and next, to get that rank, which was allowed me by Congreſs, properly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognized by the ſeveral Directors, to avoid miſtakes. Dr. Stringer, one of the Directors, had not only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted it with me, and refuſed to make his returns to me, as Director-General, as Congreſs required; but appealed to Congreſs for its deciſion, which was given in my favour. <hi>See appendix, page</hi> 30.</p>
            <p>Although my application to him was reſpectful, and as I informed him, only made with a view to know my ſtation, and that of others, that I might perform the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties expected of me, without interference with any; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of favouring me with any extract from the reſolves of Congreſs, to which I referred for information, he ſaw fit to ſubſtitute his own dictates, in place of thoſe of Congreſs. See page 149, 150, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>My rank and authority being ſecurely fenced in, by repeated acts and reſolves of Congreſs, there was no poſſibility for the Director of the flying camp, or his friends, to accompliſh their ſecret purpoſes, without firſt breaking down the ſeparating wall of diſtinction. By this means, the perſon, who would not ſubmit to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded from his rank, would be obliged to reſign, and, to inſure ſucceſs, it was eaſy for artful perſons to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite or encourage complaints, and to bring them before Congreſs, to afford a pretext for diſplacing him. But then it was of conſequence, that he ſhould be kept ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
<pb n="XXIX" facs="unknown:015447_0016_0F9981504F5F64F0"/>
of thoſe complaints, and of his accuſers, and to prevent his obtaining an hearing, leſt he ſhould vindicate himſelf, and thereby diſappoint their hopes. Nothing could anſwer their purpoſes better, than to puſh for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining his diſmiſſion, without a trial, which might enable him to clear himſelf from all aſperſions, and juſtify his conduct in the face of Day, to the confuſion of his enemies.</p>
            <p>After this detail of facts, compared with the ſeveral reſolves of Congreſs, and the proceedings thereon, with the relation I am about to give of the particular beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the Director, in conſequence of them; let every impartial man lay his hand upon his heart, and aſk himſelf, ingenuouſly, what he thinks of the whole matter, and of the ſeveral appearances, which concur, in an uniform ſeries to point to one object? Will they view the reſolves of October 9th, and the manner of wording them, after all that had paſſed, as a mere ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental mode of expreſſion, in men ſo wiſe, ſo much accuſtomed to weigh, and ſo well acquainted with the import of words and the force of language, and as on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intended to re-iterate, and renew former appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, without any deſign, in thoſe who framed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, I will not ſay to throw duſt in the eyes of the Members of Congreſs, in general, but to draw them into a meaſure, of which they might not conſider its tendency, not only of effecting an alteration in one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, but of making ſuch an entire innovation upon another, as was not generally thought of, and would lead to the great changes that have ſince taken place?</p>
            <p>Can it be ſaid that neither the Secretary, who, though no Member of Congreſs, has an intereſt with many of them, without doors; nor any of the members them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, were apprized of the difficulties that would, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably, ariſe from a reſolve of Congreſs, calculated to throw down the former ſettled diſtinctions, of July 17, 1775, and 1776, and Auguſt 20, laſt; in which my rank was ſo clearly recognized and eſtabliſhed. One part of my
<pb n="XXX" facs="unknown:015447_0017_0F9981514DB892C0"/>
errand to Philadelphia, laſt June, was to confer with the Committee of Congreſs, on the neceſſary eſtabliſhments for keeping up a clear and regular ſubordination in the General Hoſpital, through all its various departments, and this was the ſubject of ſeveral letters, to different Members. If any of the Members of Congreſs had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, in me, any want of abilities, for ſo important a poſt; is it not reaſonable to imagine they would have openly, and avowedly, aſſigned it as a cauſe of diſquali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication? But did they ever do it? Nay; what ſays the Secretary, himſelf, in his letter, of Auguſt 14, by way of making ſome acknowledgment for the miſtake he had committed, in his former, of Auguſt 2d. It is the teſtimony, not of a friend, but an enemy, and one, whom I believe to be a deep agent in my removal. I will therefore quote his very words; for "<hi>fas eſt ab <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oſte doceri.</hi>"</p>
            <p>"There is no man, Sir, acquainted with you, who can doubt of your abilities. All the world bears wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them, and the learned in Europe, who muſt be allowed to be the beſt judges, have given ample teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, by the honours they have heaped upon you. While you exerciſe your great talents, for the benefit of thoſe entruſted to your care, your Country will honour you, and poſterity will do you juſtice; even though Dr. S—, when you chance to meet, ſhould refuſe to give you precedence."</p>
            <p>I proceed to the relation of what happened, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of thoſe reſolves of Congreſs, of October 9th, and the ſtrange behaviour of Dr. Shippen, the weſtern Director, thereupon.</p>
            <p>Being at Hackinſack, ſoon after this "<hi>new arange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>" as he was pleaſed to ſtile it, took place, I employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed myſelf, with all poſſible induſtry, to put the hoſpital affairs in ſuch a train, at Hackinſack, that Dr. Warren might conduct them, without my preſence afterwards, that I might, without hinderance, be able to proceed to the White-Plains, to which place, General Waſhington,
<pb n="XXXI" facs="unknown:015447_0017_0F9981514DB892C0"/>
and the army under him, had marched, a day or two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and the Britiſh troops were taking the ſame rout. I called, therefore, on General Green, at his camp, near Fort-Lee, to repreſent to him the ſituation of the ſick, at Hackinſack, and to requeſt his orders for procuring Dr. Warren ſuch aſſiſtance, from the Quarter-Maſter-General's, and the Commiſſarial departments, as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. I met the weſtern Director there who, with a peculiar freedom, becoming the elevation to which he ſeemed to conſider himſelf as already raiſed, or to be raiſed, demanded why I was not at my poſt, on the other ſide the river? Accuſtomed to receive accounts from others, and to give orders myſelf, in the affairs of my department, I could not but feel the indignity of being thus taken to taſk by him; and anſwered him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. I diſcovered his deſires and aims, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded he had more LEE-WAY yet to make, than to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title him to avow his ſentiments ſo openly; but in this, it ſeems, I was miſtaken.</p>
            <p>The day following, Dr. Foſter, to whoſe charge I had left the direction of the hoſpital, and care of the hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſtores, at Newark, came over, in haſte, and deſired a private converſation with me, on a ſubject of ſome deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy. As I had viſited Newark, within a very few days, and every thing was reported to me to be in good order, and I had left all the directions I thought neceſſary for future regulations, previous to my return to Head-Quarters, I could not conceive the occaſion of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected viſit. But my foreboding mind took the alarm, of which I was yet ignorant of the cauſe, for he inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me it was of ſuch a nature, as made him think <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to communicate, by letter.</p>
            <p>After this preparation, he informed me, that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector had called on him, and propoſed, but with great art and addreſs, the ſurrendering up of the hoſpitals and ſtores to his Direction; the care of the ſick to remain under the ſame perſons whom I had ſent from my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, but to act under his authority. He replied
<pb n="XXXII" facs="unknown:015447_0018_0F998151653884C8"/>
that he conſidered himſelf as under my direction only, in hoſpital matters; and that he did not think himſelf at liberty to deliver up the ſtores to any perſon, without a written order from General Waſhington, or the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector-General. To this the Director made anſwer, that whatever like, or diſlike, I might ſhew to this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, I ſhould find myſelf obliged to acquieſce in it.</p>
            <p>The conſtruction which the gentleman put upon this proceeding, was, that the appointment of the Director, being, to form and ſuperintend the hoſpital of the flying camp, would terminate in a little time, as the troops, compoſing the army, raiſed for that ſervice, were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſted but for a few months, unleſs he could carve out ſome place that he could be pleaſed with, in the mean while, that would put him on a better eſtabliſhment. I commended his prudence, in declining to deliver up the ſtores, without proper orders, and deſired, that, if any further demands, of the like kind, were made by Dr. Shippen, to refer him to me, for an anſwer.</p>
            <p>The Director had expreſſed himſelf to me, about a month before, in a manner that correſponded with the above idea. He told me, frankly, that he ſhould like, well enough, to continue in the ſervice, as he thought it a more gentlemanny life, than that of a drudging private practitioner. I was truly deſirous of his continuance in that ſtation, if he could remain in it, without elbow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me out of any thing that appertained to my place; for I did not then imagine he had yet aſpired to the place itſelf.</p>
            <p>Having ſerved in the army, the whole of laſt war, and had pretenſions, on that account, to ſome years ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in military hoſpitals, which he knew nothing of; and having been appointed to the chief direction of the hoſpitals, the pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ceeding year, and having borne the burden of the day, ever ſince, it had not yet entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my imagination, that I was ſoon to give place to the very man, who, but four months before, not four months, nay, ſcarcely three, had written to announce
<pb n="XXXIII" facs="unknown:015447_0018_0F998151653884C8"/>
his appointment, as Director of the hoſpital of the fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing camp, and that he had enliſted himſelf in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the American States, confeſſed his being a mere novice in the management of his (ſubordinate) depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and applied to me for inſtructions in the <hi>etiquette,</hi> the word by which he choſe to expreſs his notion, of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of a General Hoſpital; and who promiſed, from time to time to report to me the ſtate of the hoſpitals under him, agreeable to an order of Congreſs for the purpoſe; but which, however, he never did. Perhaps he judged, from better information than I could ever obtain, that ſo ſoon as he had learned the "<hi>etiquette</hi>" of military hoſpitals, his elevation would render it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary.</p>
            <p>But what ſurprized me, in his late conduct, was, that having an opportunity to acquaint me, the day before, in perſon, at General Green's, with his expectations and demands on the hoſpitals I had eſtabliſhed, he did not chuſe to ſay any thing to myſelf on the ſubject, but to apply to ſubordinate officers, to accompliſh his wiſhes, rather than treat with me as a principal; I thought this portended no good; but then I knew it was of a piece with very many other inſtances of his conduct, on dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent occaſions.</p>
            <p>I went over, in a day or two after, to the White-Plains. A letter ſoon arrived from the Director to General Waſhington, complaining that his ſituation was uneaſy, for he could not obtain the command of the ſtores at Newark, and of courſe of the hoſpitals I had eſtabliſhed there, and of the officers I had detached from my particular department, unleſs by the General's orders for the purpoſe, or by directions from me; for which, however, as I obſerved before, he had never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</p>
            <p>The General was pleaſed to communicate this letter to me. I repreſented to him the inconveniences of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving me of thoſe ſtores, and that I had no others, in any ſufficient quantity, to anſwer the continual calls
<pb n="XXXIV" facs="unknown:015447_0019_0F9981523B6A1158"/>
upon me; that the reſt of the ſtores, which, at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, were ordered to Stamford, (and from thence were removed by the Stamford Committee, without my knowledge, and with his approbation, as I afterwards learned) could be of no uſe to me, at that time; that the only medicines, which could be got at, were thoſe at Newark, which I had ſnatched as a brand out of the fire, at the retreat from New-York; and that I had appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Apothecary on purpoſe to aſſort and diſpenſe them out to Regimental Surgeons at Newark, as there was no poſſibility of doing it in an army, conſtantly moving from place to place, under all the inconveniences we ſuffered. To be borne down, with inceſſant demands from all quarters, was hard indeed; and to be depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the only reſources I had left me, thoſe of my own providing, and of my own ſaving, with extreme diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty and hazard, to be at the ſole command of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a junior, and inferior officer, appeared to me to be an unreaſonable demand. I had, already, detached near one half of the Surgeons and Mates, of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Hoſpital, to Newark and Hackinſack, and by the General's command, eſtabliſhed hoſpitals there, at the very time I had pointed out the probable conſequences that would enſue from the extraordinary reſolves of Congreſs, October 9th. There were, at this time, above fifteen hundred ſick, at thoſe two places, under the care of my own Surgeons. I had juſt received let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from them, which ſhewed they were gradually working through all their fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mer difficulties, by ſteadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purſuing the directions I had left them: With theſe advantages and their own experience they were more likely to compleat the work, than they would be, if in the midſt of it they were to receive new directions from one, who, with all due deference to his abilities was leſs acquainted, than themſelves, with the arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a General Hoſpital I obſerved, that to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver up the hoſpitals <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, would be to ſtrip me of all power of being uſeful; and it was not
<pb n="XXXV" facs="unknown:015447_0019_0F9981523B6A1158"/>
in the power of the director to ſupply their places, if the ſtores, hoſpitals and ſick, were to be committed to his care, and my proper officers were to return under my command, on the eaſt ſide of the River; whence the-ſick muſt ſuffer; and if the ſtores were delivered up, we ourſelves muſt become deſtitute and helpleſs, and yet expoſed to greater clamours than ever. I had, in no inſtance, interfered with the Director of the Fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Camp, but offered to give him every aſſiſtance in my power, that he was pleaſed to call for. But to be ſtripped of the rank of a Director-General, and the power of my ſtation, and to be left but the ſhadow of a Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and yet to be accountable for every accident, or miſconduct of others, as well as of my own department, and, from the higheſt poſt, to be rendered the mere depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of a junior and ſubordinate officer, was what I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver would ſubmit to. Sooner than be ſubject to ſuch controul, or give up the ſtores and hoſpitals, which by the General's orders I had eſtabliſhed for the ſick of his own army, when I had no convenience for providing others, I would give up my commiſſion.</p>
            <p>The General promiſed he would, and I doubt not but he did write to the Director, in anſwer to his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, "That the hoſpitals I had eſtabliſhed, and the ſurgeons and ſtores I had ſent to Newark and Hackin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſack, were to remain under my direction."</p>
            <p>What was my ſurprize to hear, after ſome time, from ſome of the officers of the hoſpital that were under me, in the Jerſeys, [for it ſeemed proper that I ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver know, but in a circuitous manner, what moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately regarded myſelf,] that thoſe ſtores which had been provided for General Waſhington's army, and which I had ſaved at New-York, and ſent to the Jerſeys for ſafety, and for the convenience of iſſuing out to the hoſpital ſick under my own care, and to the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Surgeons, were now actually ordered, by a late vote of Congreſs, to be delivered up to the Director of the Flying-Camp; and that he received letters, at
<pb n="XXXIX" facs="unknown:015447_0021_0F998153A89B3BB0"/>
appeared on the point of being ſwallowed up for ever, if ſome vigorous meaſures were not immediately purſued to apply an effectual remedy; and I had ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, without waiting for orders, to fly to the place of danger, where I thought my preſence moſt wanted, I had no doubts that I ſhould no ſooner have mentioned my apprehended grievance, than I ſhould have had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate redreſs. Fully perſuaded that my ſervices and ſacrifices merited conſideration, and entirely ignorant that malice had yet attempted to diſcolour the merit of my proceedings, I did not ſuſpect that any crime had been laid to my charge, till I complained of the injury done me. So ſhort ſighted are mortals, and ſo true it is that a man is never expoſed to greater hazards than when he leaſt apprehends them. Now, for the firſt time, I heard of the clamours about the ſufferings of the ſick in the Jerſies, and at Philadelphia; and although I had been reſtricted to the eaſt ſide of Hudſon's-River, to make way for one of riſing intereſt, the misfortunes of the department committed to his care, were wholly aſcribed to me, notwithſtanding the direction was taken out of my hands, for his ſake.</p>
            <p>I applied for admiſſion to Congreſs; Mr. Samuel Adams appeared. On mentioning the cauſe of my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, he gave me to underſtand that complaints were brought againſt me, and the ſufferings of the ſick charged to me, with circumſtances greatly reflecting on my humanity. I denied the juſtice of the charge, and being at the door of the chamber where the Congreſs were ſetting, I thus addreſſed him: Sir, I do ſolemnly deny the charge, and do intreat I may, this inſtant, be introduced to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, that I may have an opportunity of vindicating my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt every injurious aſperſion. Of this, Sir, I am confident, the more my conduct, in the ſtation of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector-General, is examined into the more luſtre will it reflect upon me. I aſk <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> an inquiry. I deſire to know the particulars of the charge and who are my accuſers, to meet them face to face, and am willing to ſtand the teſt of the ſtricteſt ſcrutiny.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="XI" facs="unknown:015447_0022_0F9981546776A558"/>
I was refuſed admiſſion, it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſaid the Congreſs was engaged in ſome important matter. I again deſired the gentleman to inform me what particulars were laid to my charge? I could neither learn them, nor who were my accuſers. As I could not obtain an audience, at that time, I begged Mr. Adams to inform Congreſs of the deſign of my coming, and my deſire of admiſſion, and I let him know that I waited at my lodgings, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of an hearing, when Congreſs had lieſure to grant it. I obtained it not. Congreſs adjourned to Maryland, without taking the leaſt notice of my appeal to them. I repeated my application, through the ſame gentleman, by letter. My diſmiſſion took place without an hearing, and without any anſwer, and without ſuſpending me from office, till they could be ſatisfied of the facts alledged againſt me; for this, it ſeems would be too great a condeſcenſion.</p>
            <p>I would fain aſk, whether ſuch a denial of my humble requeſt, and keeping me in ignorance of my reputed crimes, and ſecret accuſers, is agreeable to humanity, or what is uſually allowed to the greateſt criminals? Is it a way to beget a reliance on the ſafety and honour of the Houſe, that after having paſſed judgment, without an hearing, I may ſtill depend on ample juſtice, candour and generoſity of treatment? Is ſuch a proceeding uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual? Might I not have rather expected to have been firſt ſuſpended, then tried, and judgment to follow, and not precede conviction, on any breach of order or miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct?</p>
            <p>Had I been conſcious of guilt, may it not be preſumed I ſhould have ſought to ſhelter myſelf, by a reſignation, rather than inſiſt on a trial? Could a better pretext have been afforded? The Congreſs, contrary to every known rule, by a reſolve of theirs, had reduced me from the rank of Director-General, removed me from my right, of attending the army under the Commander in Chief, to give place to a temporary Director, who, before, was made accountable to me, as head of the department;

clamours were raiſed againſt me, (groundleſs indeed!) I aſked for an hearing, and was refuſed. Reſignation was intimated to me, as what alone would quiet thoſe clamours. What temptation was there for a perſon conſcious of guilt, to wiſh a continuance in office, till his conduct could be examined into? On the contrary, every thing was to be apprehended under that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. The moſt imminent danger that the cauſe itſelf was loſt filled the minds of many. I ſaw the black clouds gathering on the margin of the political horriſon, threatening, on every ſide, to over-whelm its abettors in a general deſtruction, on one hand; and myſelf in private ruin, on the other; unleſs I could make my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat from the approaching tempeſt. Did I, coward-like, baſely fly; nay, the very appearance of danger de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined me to face the ſtorm, and prove the falſity of the charges againſt me. I met two of the Georgia De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates. I acquainted them with what had happened; that I would ſtand by the cauſe, during the preſent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous onſet; but when that was over, I would inſiſt on an immediate hearing, and, if not granted, then reſign.</p>
            <p>I repaired to the ſcene of danger, but was ordered to the eaſt ſide of Hudſon's-River. Submiſſion was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

I purſued my buſineſs, as though I had received no cauſe of complaint, till I could obtain an hearing. But inſtead of redreſs, the firſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I received, but through an indirect channel, was that of my diſmiſſion. I had prepared, in haſte, a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of my proceedings, in the department committed to me.

At any rate, if they were determined to deliver me up to the cries of a faction, I thought Congreſs, for its own ſake, would have let me down gently.

And could not all theſe procure ſome ſhadow of lenity, where a victim was to be offered up; ſomething like compaſſion; ſome anſwer to my humble memorial, in my vindication, and my petition only "<hi>to be heard</hi>"?

In the mean while, as if that refuſal was the ſignal; the alarm ſpread; news-papers bear witneſs to my degradation. Baſe and malicious men, the peſts of every ſociety, have given free vent to their ſlanders. Boſton has been filled with cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours to my prejudice. Villains there are in every place, to coin and circulate reports, prejudicial to a man's character. But why ſhould I pretend to enumerate the evil conſequences of ſuch a ſeverity of conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me?

To the impartial publick I therefore mean to appeal.

            <p>WHEN I was called by the choice of my country, to the ſtation of Director-General of the hoſpital and Phyſician in chief, I left a reſpectable and lucrative practice againſt the judgment of ſome conſiderable perſons in my native city, who, from regard to me, and what they conceived to be my intereſt, endeavoured in vain to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade me from accepting the poſt, truly honourable as they allowed it to be. Their advice had no influence over me. Without heſitation, I ſacrificed it, with every future proſpect of better expectations from continuing with them to the ſatisfaction of ſerving my country, AT THE HEAD OF THE HOSPITAL, IN THE ARMY, UN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DER YOUR EXCELLENCY'S IMMEDIATE COMMAND.</p>
            <p>Having had ſome experience, in times paſt, of the nature of the department, I have, ever ſince I took charge of it, made it my conſtant ſtudy, to make myſelf maſter of the ſubject, and to acquire a thorough inſight into it. With what ſucceſs, I do not think can be judged off, from the outſide appearances of laſt campaign, and the cauſes which prevented the ſeveral regulations I propoſed, from taking place agreeable to my wiſhes. It would be te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to enumerate them all; yet it cannot be amiſs to point at ſome of the principal.<note n="a" place="bottom">See the Appendix.</note>

               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:015447_0025_0F998156A9B19580"/>
The firſt of theſe which I ſhall mention was, the want of ſufficient time and opportunity before the opening of the campaign, to have all the regimental Surgeons properly furniſhed by Congreſs, and made acquainted with their duty, of which many of them were very ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, and the <hi>error</hi> of having them look to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hoſpital for thoſe ſupplies of medicines and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp;c. which it would have been better to have ſent to them by Continental Druggiſts, who might have the means of collecting and preparing every article in a ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table manner, which it is vain to attempt in a moving army. Another cauſe was the want of a ſufficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of certain hoſpital officers and aſſiſtants, and the means of procuring them when allowed by Congreſs, which was late, as Commiſſaries, Storekeepers, Stewards, Ward-Maſters, &amp;c. (<hi>b</hi>) This difficulty was increaſed from the nature of the campaign, in which, contrary to expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, it became neceſſary, to ſhift the places of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral hoſpital frequently, and to branch it out in ſuch a number of hoſpitals widely diſtant from each other. (<hi>c</hi>) To theſe may be added, firſt, the want of ſufficient help from other departments, which it was impoſſible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy in the ſtate our army then was. (<hi>d</hi>)</p>
            <p>2dly, The neglect of the regimental Surgeons, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the ſick of their regiments in ſeaſon, and in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly manner to the General hoſpital, though often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in General orders, Reſolves of Congreſs and otherwiſe, to do it; (<hi>e</hi>) and ſometimes keeping back their ſick from entering into it at all, or till they became very numerous; then diſcharging them all at once into the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral hoſpital, at the time of an engagement with the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and when the attention of the whole body of hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Surgeons was neceſſary to take care of the wounded. And laſtly, the frequent and long abſence of the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Surgeons from their regiments, who, inſtead of ſending the ſick, as they ought to have done, to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral hoſpital, had them conveyed to ſome remote regimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal hoſpitals, where they neither had, nor could obtain ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table neceſſaries for their proviſion and care (<hi>f</hi>)</p>

               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:015447_0025_0F998156A9B19580"/>
On my firſt arrival at Cambridge, I ſet about to eſtabliſh rules for the General hoſpital Surgeons. I had heard of many abuſes being practiſed by enormous drafts of expenſive ſtores from the General hoſpital, to which, with your Excellency's approbation, to whom I made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port thereof, I put a ſtop and limited the demands of regimental Surgeons to ſuch articles, as Indian meal, oat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal, rice, barley, molaſſes, and the like, and required that ſuch ſick as wanted others, ſhould be ſent to the General hoſpital, that theſe things might be diſpenſed out under my own direction. (<hi>g</hi>)</p>
            <p>The next reformation I attempted was to call upon all the Mates in the hoſpital to undergo an examination of their abilities, in order to ſelect from the number thoſe who were beſt qualified for the ſervice.—This was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by your Excellency's orders, to ſee that all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimental Surgeons and Mates ſhould paſs a like exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. I began the taſk, but the movements of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, the averſion of Surgeons to undergo theſe examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, from which too they were often ſcreened by their Colonels, and by pretence of ſickneſs, &amp;c. and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing buſineſs on hand prevented my proceeding far in it. (<hi>h</hi>)</p>
            <p>When the army lay before Boſton, the ſmall-pox fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently made it's appearance in it, owing to the number of perſons who came out of that city with the infection upon them, which endangered the ſpreading of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion amongſt our troops. By the eſtabliſhment of the ſmall-pox hoſpital in a ſuitable place, with proper perſons to take care of the ſick, and the precaution of ſending all infected perſons to it, ſo ſoon as known to have the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and to cut off all communication betwixt it and the troops, the army was preſerved from ever receiving any injury from it.</p>
            <p>When the troops marched from Cambridge for New-York, all the ſick were left behind in the General hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, amounting to upwards of three hundred men. In leſs than ſix weeks, during which time but few died, I
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:015447_0026_0F998157692C5FF0"/>
was able to diſcharge the hoſpital of every man, to ſettle and pay every account, inſomuch as never to have had any further demands from that quarter.</p>
            <p>During this time, with little or no expence to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic but for package and tranſportation I collected medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, furniture and hoſpital ſtores, worth many thouſand pounds, and ſent them on to New-York. The like quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, I apprehend, could not be procured in any part of America. Nor were theſe obtained for the uſe of the army, without much trouble and aſſiduity, owing to a ſtrong oppoſition that was made to prevent it. (<hi>k</hi>)—Beſides theſe, I was able, by means of the ſubaltern officers in the hoſpital, ſome of whom I employed continually at the work, likewiſe to collect to the amount of near two thouſand rugs and blankets, near as many bedſacks and pillows which were taken up from docks, and were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from hoſpitals and barracks, &amp;c. Theſe being waſhed and aired ſerved the laſt campaign when none others could be got, and many of them are yet in good preſervation.—At New-York I collected ſome hundred ſheets, fracture boxes, and other uſeful articles.</p>
            <p>It may be thought perhaps that I place a higher value upon theſe acquiſitions than they merit; be that as it may, I am perſuaded the like could not be obtained now for much leſs than thirty thouſand dollars, which is equal to the whole amount of what I have ever drawn or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended for the General hoſpital, in the ſpace of a twelve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>month, including the pay of all the officers and all the hoſpital expences of every kind, which have fallen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my department to ſettle, and for the faithful expendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſame, I am ready to produce my accounts, receipts and vouchers, whenever called upon for a ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Yet the General hoſpital has had the conſtant charge of a number from two or three hundred to a thouſand ſick and upwards to provide for and attend. Nor have any articles of the public ſtores been embezzled or mis-applied, nor the ſick ſuffered in the General hoſpital for want of any thing I thought them entitled to draw from the hoſpital, and that I could procure for them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:015447_0026_0F998157692C5FF0"/>
The medicines and ſtores provided, as above mentioned, have been appropriated with equal faithfulneſs and ſtrict oeconomy to the uſe of the General hoſpital; or iſſued from thence to regimental Surgeons, or remain on hand, ſubject to your Excellency's order. I have never bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened the Quarter-Maſter-General's department with any unneceſſary demand from thence. And as to the Commiſſary-General, he will do me juſtice, as he has often declared himſelf on that head, that my drafts were within the moſt reaſonable bounds. I am perſuaded that of the ſick who have been drawn for in the General hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, if none of them have been drawn for at the ſame time with the well men in their regiments, the ſtoppage of their rations will go a great way towards paying the whole of the expences the hoſpital has been put to, on their account, for proviſion and ſtores of whatever kind. (<hi>l</hi>)</p>
            <p>In a conference I once had with your Excellency at Cambridge, on the ſubject of hoſpital expences, you told me, and I took it as a hint of caution and advice to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſtricteſt oeconomy in my department (from which I have never deviated) that you were fearful the expences of the General hoſpital would exceed the eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate that had been made of them, by a perſon of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in General hoſpital matters. If I rightly recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, your Excellency thought the ſum mentioned to be ten thouſand pounds ſterling per annum. I was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, and concluded the gentleman was miſtaken; I reſolved however, if poſſible, to employ ſuch ſtrict oecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omy in the department, as to keep within thoſe bounds, yet was fearful it could not be accompliſhed, on account of the advanced price of every article of living and hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſtores. Deſirous of knowing what were the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples on which he founded the calculation, I wrote to the perſon that was mentioned, on the ſubject, in anſwer to which he informed me, that the eſtimate, he had given in to General Gates was ten thouſand pounds ſterling, for every ten thouſand men, for ſix months, and ſo in proportion, which is equal to 40 000 £. ſter. per. annum, for 20,000 men, the number then kept on foot.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:015447_0027_0F99815825D057F8"/>
At the ſame time, as one qualified to give me full in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, I wrote to him with a view to clear up all doubts, or to confirm my ſentiments in regard to the manner in which the regimental Surgeons were ſupplied in the Britiſh ſervice, with medicines and inſtruments, and to know what right they had to draw ſtores from the General hoſpital; to which his anſwer correſponded with the opinion I had ever entertained of the nature of the ſervice. 'Till Congreſs, or your Excellency ſhould give orders for a different mode to be purſued, I conſidered myſelf to be bound in duty to keep the Britiſh eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment conſtantly in my eye, as a directory, making allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for the nature and difference of the ſervice. (<hi>m</hi>)</p>
            <p>Moreover, I was afterwards favored with your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency's opinion on the ſubject, contained in thoſe obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations you was pleaſed to beſtow on the plan of regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which, by your command I ſketched out, for get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting again into a proper train, after we had, by one acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent or another, been forced from the original plan of a General hoſpital, and got into confuſion, on account of the oppoſition, ſome of the reſolves of Congreſs, of July 17 laſt, met with from many of the regimental Surgeons, and the impracticability of complying with others of them, in the ſituation we were then placed. Your words were, "What is the practiſe in this caſe in the Britiſh army? Why ſhould we think of improving upon their ſyſtem, founded on long experience?"</p>
            <p>Upon firſt entering upon the duties of my ſtation, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending that the General hoſpital was not amply ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, as I could wiſh, with bandages, old linnen and other implements of ſurgery, that would be required, in caſe of an action, I ſet myſelf to ſupply thoſe wants im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, which I effected with little expence of money, but with great labor, in which I had all poſſible aſſiſtance from the hoſpital Surgeons and Mates. I collected large quantities of old linnen, lint and ſheets, made up ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand bandages, and ſix hundred tourniquets, for the uſe of the General hoſpital, &amp;c. which, though ſufficient for
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:015447_0027_0F99815825D057F8"/>
a preſent ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>igency, I did not think more than might be wanted for ſix hoſpitals, which I managed at that time.</p>
            <p>Being then deſirous of knowing how the regimental Surgeons were ſupplied, I propoſed the calling upon them in general orders, for that purpoſe, and with a view to learn whether their aſſiſtance could be depended upon in the field, and whether they were properly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with medicines. Except Mr. Magaw, Surgeon of Col. Thomſon's regiment, and a few others, they had ſcarcely the ſhadow of a ſupply—I gave in a report there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, with a weekly return of the ſick; I alſo ſtated to your Excellency what I conceived to be my duty, and that it was limited to the care of the ſick in the General hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.</p>
            <p>This inquiry into the wants of regimental Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, made them turn, as it were, on the General hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital. They wiſhed to furniſh themſelves from it, with thoſe articles of dreſſings, which the hoſpital Surgeons had collected, and made up for themſelves, which thoſe gentlemen thought an unreaſonable demand. Farther, the regimental Surgeons wanted, contrary to all uſage, to draw from the General hoſpital, all they ſhould call for, in the way of ſtores, whether diaetetic or medicinal, for the uſe of the ſick retained under their care, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimental hoſpitals, and to be provided by me with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments and bandages, or to fix the odium of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency at my door. I therefore recommended in my report the neceſſity of providing (not in the army or General hoſpital) but from Continental Druggiſts (for that was what I intended) "a capital ſet of medicines, inſtruments, &amp;c. as ſoon as poſſible, and adviſed that portable cheſts ſhould be furniſhed from every regiment for a whole year, at once, and each cheſt be provided with inſtruments and bandages."—I did not expect, weak handed as I was, with reſpect to officers and aſſiſtants in the General hoſpital, from its very eſtabliſhment by Congreſs, that this taſk would be enjoined on me, I thought my duty pointed out by that eſtabliſhment, as much as I
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:015447_0028_0F998159C3B76E68"/>
could well execute, and which only related to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hoſpital itſelf; although with an earneſt deſire of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the good of the ſervice, I early pointed out the wants of the regiment Surgeons, and in time for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſupplied with neceſſaries after the manner that has always been practiſed in the Britiſh army, I wrote to inform your Excellency, "that my commiſſion only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the care of the General Hoſpital; the plan of eſtabliſhment by Congreſs, of July 28, 1775. The liſt, number and arrangement of officers, and my inſtructions from Congreſs, which were wholly ſilent concerning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments, their Surgeons or ſupplies confirmed this opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion," not to ſay any thing of the low eſtimate, which I had underſtood was formed for the ſupport of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral hoſpital.</p>
            <p>I then gave it as my opinion, grounded on the cuſtom of the Britiſh army, of ſupplying the medicine cheſts by ſtoppages, "that if the ſick, remaining in regiments, were to be ſupplied at a public expence (and not by ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pages) that expence ought to be made a regimental charge, and might be delivered in with an abſtract of the regiment, (or any other better way,) that the General hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, having nothing to do with the affair from its very nature, ought not to be burdened with their ſupplies; for then, on the number of ſick admitted in the General hoſpital being known, the expence neceſſary for their ſupport could, after a while, be better eſtimated from experience."</p>
            <p>I then called on your Excellency, in the ſame letter, "for inſtructions what to do?' I informed you "that the nature and deſign of the General hoſpital, being little underſtood, and the nature of my duty ſo much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, both by the regimental Surgeons and officers, and many things expected from me, impoſſible to be complied with, I apprehended it to be abſolutely neceſſary that certain regulations ſhould be fixed upon, to aſcertain my duty, and thoſe of the Surgeons and officers under me, as well as thoſe of the regimental Surgeons, which all
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:015447_0028_0F998159C3B76E68"/>
ought to know, and not hoſpital and regimental Surgeons only, but in general, every officer of any rank in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, to prevent interference and miſtakes."—</p>
            <p>Beſides giving this information, in order to bring about a farther explanation of the matter, and with a view to accompliſh the end propoſed by it; when I came to New-York, I laid a plan before the regimental Surgeons, to aſcertain their duty, with a draft for a memorial to be laid by them before Congreſs ſtating their preſent diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, of which they approved; and I wrote preſſingly myſelf on the ſubject, to the Doctors Committee of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs; and at various other times I have delivered my opinion on the duties of regimental Surgeons, which may be ſeen in the general orders, particularly of July 3d, and July 28th, 1776. But although the ſentiments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in thoſe orders were enjoined by your Excellency to be made the rule of conduct, and I think they were well calculated to anſwer the purpoſe, yet they were little regarded <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y many of the regimental Surgeons, and openly oppoſed by others. (<hi>n</hi>)</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the manner in which I came to have the charge of ſupplying all the regimental Surgeons with medicine cheſts, &amp;c. contrary to what I had always conceived to be the proper method, or uſual for a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hoſpital, as I had always declared, I beg leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that the ſurrender of Boſton having put us in poſſeſſion of a large, though unaſſorted ſtock of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, hoſpital furniture, &amp;c. your Excellency was pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to order me, by the Quarter-Maſter-General, to put up medicine cheſts for five regiments, at Boſton, Salem and Marblehead, &amp;c. about the time the reſt of the army moved to New-York. This I cannot but look upon as the beginning of all my ſubſequent difficulties. When I arrived afterwards at New-York, your Excellency was at Philadelphia, and I was repeatedly called upon by letters, and in the way of perſonal applications from regimental Surgeons and officers, to furniſh ſeveral regiments that were at New-York, and others gone to Canada, with
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:015447_0029_0F99815A6542AA70"/>
medicine cheſts. My hope and expectation had been, that out of the whole ſtock I had collected, I might be permitted to take ſuch as were wanted for the General hoſpital, and then to deliver the remainder to any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary or Continental Druggiſt, appointed by Congreſs, or by your Excellency, to receive it, for the uſe of the public, and particularly for furniſhing regimental Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons. I received ſeveral intimations at this time, from different perſons, that Congreſs expected from me to ſupply the northern army with medicines and hoſpital ſtores.</p>
            <p>Having received no orders, however, for that purpoſe and the campaign then opening, I thought it highly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to receive clear inſtructions on that head, and applied for leave to go to Philadelphia, to have a confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with ſome members of Congreſs to know what I had to depend upon. Your Excellency gave me leave of abſence for ten days, and although it proved too ſhort a time to ſettle the buſineſs of my department, yet I return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed punctually on the day appointed.</p>
            <p>Before my arrival at Philadelphia, I learned that the Congreſs had purchaſed a valuable ſtock of medicines, which were in the hands of ſome druggiſts in town, out of which (on a ſuppoſition I imagine that they had more than would be wanted for public uſe) ſuch conſiderable ſales had been made by permiſſion of Congreſs, and large quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities ſent to the Southward, that it appeared to me there was danger, from the great reduction that was made in it already, leſt the beſt collection of medicines I had ever ſeen in America for an army, might ſlip out of the power of Congreſs from ſuch ſale, &amp;c. which might prove a loſs they might not have it in their power to retrieve in the whole year. (<hi>o</hi>) I therefore preſumed to caution the committee againſt it. Upon conferring with them on the ſubject, as I had, though contrary to uſage, been obliged to put up medicine cheſts for ſome regiments, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took, if I might be allowed ſuch a ſhare of what was on hand as might be wanting from time to time to aſſort
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:015447_0029_0F99815A6542AA70"/>
thoſe in my poſſeſſion, to uſe my beſt endeavours to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply regimental cheſts to the regiments at New-York un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your Excellency's command, for one campaign by way of trial; for I did not want to ſhrink from any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, aſſigned me, whether my proper duty or not, by which I might ſerve my country, as far as it was practicable for me to do it.</p>
            <p>I did not conceive from all I was able to learn that there would be more than forty or fifty regiments aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at New-York; nor did I ſuppoſe that one half of thoſe would come deſtitute of medicines and chirurgical apparatus, when I heard that the Southward regiments were ſupplied by the Continental Druggiſts; and I had taken pains at Cambridge, occaſionally, to acquaint Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral officers, Commanders of regiments and regimental Surgeons, with my idea that they were not to look to the General hoſpital for thoſe ſupplies, but have their regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments furniſhed, where raiſed, as being the moſt eaſy and natural method; nor did I expect ſuch numerous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments of militia, all of which came unprovided, and looked to me for ſupplies of every thing they wanted, not chuſing to ſend their ſick to be under the care of the Surgeons of the hoſpital.</p>
            <p>I ſupplied from 40 to 50 regiments with medicine cheſts by the end of Auguſt, beſides all the branches of the General hoſpital at New-York, in the bowry and neighbourhood, and at Long-Iſland, which reduced many of our capital articles to an inſufficiency for the General hoſpital for the remaining part of the campaign. And theſe I was obliged to collect elſewhere as well as I could; for although there was a great ſhow of medicines and furniture left, yet many of the principal medicines being exhauſted, and other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles not being duly prepared, nor ſuch as were uſually called for or wanted for regimental uſe, that ſhow availed but little. To give what were at hand and could be ſpared from hoſpital uſe, which the regimental Surgeons would neither accept of nor be anſwerable for, would be, as ſcripture expreſſes it, to give one that aſked for bread, a ſtone; or for an egg, a ſerpent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:015447_0030_0F99815D91CBDCC8"/>
It was by your Excellency's command that I ſhipped off part of the ſtores, as I did, to Stamford, to prevent the whole being loſt, in caſe the enemy ſhould poſſeſs themſelves of New York From thence they were ſent into the country, as ſome frigates had got into the Sound, and it was eaſy to land near Stamford, whereby the ſtores might be deſtroyed. (<hi>p</hi>) It was by a like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that I viſited <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oppon, Haverſtraw and Orange, to look out for a ſuitable place for a General hoſpital; and by your orders, in writing, that I went over to Newark a day or two before the evacuation of New-York, to make proviſion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> about a thouſand ſick, including thoſe wounded at the laſt action on Long-Iſland, who were there committed to the care of Doctors Foſter and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, Surgeons in the General hoſpital, with ſeven or eight Mates to take care of them. (<hi>q</hi>) Part of the medicines remaining at New-York, were ordered over by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutant-General, to whoſe perſonal activity and the aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance he gave to the Surgeons, it is owing, that they were ſaved. The moſt valuable part, however, was ſtill left in New-York, when the enemy had effected a landing, drawn a line acroſs the iſland, and were ſuppoſed to be then entering New-York. (<hi>r</hi>)</p>
            <p>At this critical juncture, I went over with ſome of the hoſpital officers, and brought off all that had been left, in a pettiauger, which was filled therewith. I had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered two cheſts, for hoſpital uſe, to be put up and ſent to Kingſbridge, it being impoſſible to get more up there, in a retreat.</p>
            <p>The ſick and wounded above-mentioned were landed in haſte and diſorder, at Hobuck, Weho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k, &amp;c. Some of our Mates fell into the hands of the enemy, and many of the Nurſes and Waiters fled, and the militia ran off and impreſſed every waggon they could find in the neighbourhood. It therefore required ſome days to get on all the ſick and wounded, through many difficulties, from the fright of the inhabitants and their reluctance to admit of the hoſpitals being ſtationed at that place.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:015447_0030_0F99815D91CBDCC8"/>
I had proviſions to collect, a Commiſſary and Ward-Maſter to ſeek, and Nurſes and Waiters to procure, with every thing neceſſary for the comfortable accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſick and wounded. I had but little aſſiſtance enough to perform this taſk, your Excellency having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined me to leave the moſt conſiderable number of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons and Mates at York iſland, in caſe of need. I made all poſſible haſte, however, to put the hoſpitals at New-Ark on a ſafe footing, which I accompliſhed in about ten days, and then returned to head-quarters.</p>
            <p>After this, judge, Sir, of my diſtreſs, to find how much this affair had been miſrepreſented to your Excellency, as I perceived it was by a letter juſt written to me by your Aid-de-Camp, ſetting forth the miſerable ſituation to which the ſick were reduced, and the clamour for want of medicines, abſolutely inſiſting on an immediate and ſufficient ſupply, for "whilſt I was reſerving the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines for caſes of emergency, the ſick were dying in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers for want of a neceſſary ſupply." I had juſt ſent to an eminent private Druggeſt, as well as to Mr. <hi>William Smith,</hi> the Continental Druggiſt, at Philadelphia, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a ſupply of ſuch articles as either I had not or could not be got at, encloſing each of them a liſt for the purpoſe. (<hi>s</hi>) Inſtead of ten pounds of Tartar Emetic, I ſent for, four ounces were all I could obtain for the whole army, ſcarcely equal to the demands of a ſingle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimental Surgeon, or for one day's conſumption for the army I prevailed on the Surgeon of a regiment to go ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs to Hartford, Norwich, Providence, Rhode-Iſland and Boſton, to procure medicines, which places were ſo bare of the articles that we principally wanted, as to occaſion a great diſappointment. What is more worthy of remark, they never came to hand till a ſhort while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the retreat from Hackenſack I had applied to Governor <hi>Trumbull</hi> by letter, for ſome aſſiſtance, which, though it was ſent as expeditiouſly as poſſible, took time (<hi>v</hi>) I alſo applied in perſon to the State of New-York, at Fiſh-Kills, hearing they had part of a ſtock of medicines
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:015447_0040_0F998164EBAB5A10"/>
purchaſed for the uſe of that State on hand, and found it had been ordered to Albany for the uſe of the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern department.</p>
            <p>What made it more aſtoniſhing that the number and clamors of the ſick ſhould be ſo great at that time is, that in a conſultation which your Excellency, General <hi>Green</hi> and General <hi>Parſons</hi> had, a few days before the evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of New-York it was there propoſed to ſend off the ſick and all unfit for duty in brigades, with ſome careful officers out of each brigade to attend them, and money to defray the expences of ſuitable accommodations and refreſhments; and a Surgeon was ordered a long with the ſick of each brigade, that they might not ſuffer for want of medical aſſiſtance.(<hi>w</hi>) I am ſtill of opinion, it was the beſt ſtep that could have been taken to prevent the ſick from falling into the enemy's hands, unleſs what I once mentioned to your Excellency as my wiſh could have been accompliſhed, <abbr>viz.</abbr> That protections might be granted to the hoſpitals on both ſides, and the ſick not become priſoners of war, but their perſons and attendants might be priviledged and ſafe, as was the caſe betwixt the French and Engliſh in the wars of Europe.</p>
            <p>Yet all the conſequences of the ſick ſuffering for want of neceſſaries—ſad ſpectacles of human woe preſenting themſelves in towns, villages and on the roads, and ſtraggling through the country, thereby exciting the terror as well as the compaſſion of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants; have been aſcribed to my department and the officers under me, at a time when we ourſelves ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and called in vain for aſſiſtance from other depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſo far as we were able, became fatigue-men and laborers to the ſick and wounded, as we could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure none from the army, and, as I mentioned before, many of our attendants and nurſes fled.</p>
            <p>At the time of my greateſt difficulty to procure an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſortment of medicines, I gave orders to the Apothecary at Newark to aſſort what he had there, which was all that could be got to diſpenſe; to iſſue to all applyerſ

the enemy had juſt made a deſcent above Kingſbridge. I was ordered over the river to view Hackenſack, and to report what numbers of ſick could be provided for at that place. On my return, I did accordingly report that if a ſufficient number of carpenters and maſons were ſet to work immediately to fit up the church, court-houſe, manufactory and a ſtore houſe or two, &amp;c. ſix or ſeven hundred men, and perhaps more might be accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated in the town and neighbourhood; but it would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire many workmen, and ſome time to prepare places for their convenient reception. I was then ordered back to carry the plan into execution with all poſſible diligence. I went accordingly, and next day no leſs than 300 men were brought into the neighbourhood for me to look after, though I was quite alone in reſpect to help. They daily increaſed in numbers, ſo that within a few days they amounted to upwards of a thouſand. I had left in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions for Dr. <hi>Warren,</hi> and a number of Mates and other hoſpital officers to follow and attend the ſick. (<hi>z</hi>)</p>
            <p>At firſt we had neither bread, flour, nor freſh provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in readineſs nor were Commſſaries at hand, from whom I could obtain any help. General <hi>Green,</hi> to whom I ſent to fort Lee for aſſiſtance, was gone over to York-iſland. So ſoon as my hands were ſtrengthened with Dr. <hi>Warren's</hi> and Mr <hi>Zabriſky's</hi> help, and the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Commiſſary and Quarter-Maſter, difficulties abated by degrees very day, and our affairs got into a more promiſing train. In the mean while the two armies having marched towards the White Plains, a battle was expected. I therefore haſtened to join your Excelleny. On my arrival I found the Surgeons of the General hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, in conſequence of orders from head-quarters, to look out for a place for the wounded at a convenient diſtance, had pitched upon the church at North-caſtle, as the moſt ſuitable they could meet with. I went to view it, and to prepare matters if the enemy's troops ſhould come to action.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:015447_0032_0F99815EF1E577D0"/>
Whilſt we were getting in readineſs, a firing of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non was heard anew, for there had been a firing heard, the day before, at fort Waſhington. On learning it was at the White Plains, every Surgeon of the hoſpital then preſent ſet out with me, immediately, for the Plains, ſeveral Mates following, with a waggon, to bring the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments and dreſſings. We fixed near the lines, and I never ſtirred from thence till the enemy retreated, which was about a week after; nor till your Excellency croſſed the river, to haſten to the ſupport of fort Waſhington. In the mean time, the ſituation of affairs would not permit your Excellency to give me leave to return to North Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, but for a few hours, to give directions, and to aſſiſt in providing for the ſick and wounded; an hoſpital Surgeon, and ſome times two or more, with three or four Mates, attending the whole time, at the Plains, in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſecond action.</p>
            <p>Here I cannot but feel for the Hoſpital Surgeons, who before they could obtain any quarters, except ſuch as a few hours induſtry enabled them to do, in a country which was not well calculated to afford any good, were ſuddenly overwhelmed with numbers of ſick ſent to them, as well as the wounded, in time of an engagement, and whilſt many of the regimental Surgeons were abſent in the country, having left their corps in the field, without aſſiſtance, contrary to orders of July 3d, at a time when an engagement was conſidered as inevitable, there were few at hand to give any aid. Hence, whilſt the hoſpital Surgeons were preparing matters at their proper ſtations in the hoſpital, clamors were excited againſt them for not being with the troops, and when they were detained at the lines, to ſupply the places of regimental Surgeons, who ought to have been there; the wounded, who were conveyed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o to the hoſpital, naturally demanded the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the whole body of Surgeons, to adminiſter aid to them. (<hi>&amp;</hi>)</p>
            <p>When I was at liberty to repair to North-Caſtle, all my applications for workmen, to out the hoſpital in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:015447_0033_0F99815FB78804C8"/>
to conſtruct chimneys, and ſecure the ſick and wounded from cold, the effects of which were ſeverely felt at that time, and of which it is thought ſome died, proved abortive. Such then as could not be accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated here, under care of Doctors Adams and Mc Knight, were ſent to Stamford and Norwalk, to the amount of above a thouſand, under the care of Doctors <hi>Turner</hi> and <hi>Euſtis,</hi> Surgeons of the General hoſpital, and every accommodation poſſible was provided for them.</p>
            <p>Before I go on with this narrative of General Hoſpital proceedings, I ſhall juſt obſerve, that in part of a day and night's time, ſeveral hundred ſick and wounded, were tranſported from Long-Iſland to New-York, amidſt a heavy rain, which fell during our retreat. They were landed at different wharves, and carried into different houſes, whilſt myſelf and thoſe about me uſed all our endeavours to collect them together, into barracks, and hoſpitals I had provided for them; and although all poſſible care was taken to prevent it, yet may of them unavoidably ſuffered, though we were up great part of the night in this ſervice.</p>
            <p>So ſoon as I was able to attend that duty in perſon, I gave my aſſiſtance in dreſſing the patients, ſo that there was not a ſingle one, of thoſe wounded in the action on Long-Iſland who were brought to the General hoſpital at New-York, that I did not dreſs myſelf; and I aſſiſted in all operations that I knew of, wherever I was preſent and could attend; for I always viſited as many ſick offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and others, out of the hoſpital, by myſelf, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation, as was any ways poſſible for me to do, conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with my other calls of duty.

            <p>How much pains I took by writing and converſation to aſſiſt in getting the regimental Surgeons on ſome footing, ſatisfactory to them, and uſeful to the army, I could adduce many proofs, if required; that I never could effect it, is what I have to lament. The cauſes I ſhall not take up your time to inveſtigate. If the plan, now before your Excellency, ſhould take pleace either in
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:015447_0033_0F99815FB78804C8"/>
whole, or part, it may perhaps effect that deſirable purpoſe, where my endeavors muſt reſt. (<hi>bb</hi>)</p>
            <p>The orders and inſtructions I have given to the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons of the General hoſpital, at different times, are numerous; ſome of them your Excellency read, approved, and ſubſcribed yourſelf.</p>
            <p>Sometimes when houſes for hoſpitals have been aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me by public authority, I have met with great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in getting poſſeſſion of them, from protections in favor of the proprietors and occupiers, or others, as in the caſe of Stuyveſants, and in thoſe in the Bowry, where a brigade of militia diſpoſſeſſed the ſick of the houſes, aſſigned for that purpoſe, by the New-York committee. (<hi>cc</hi>)</p>
            <p>To bring this narrative of my conduct to a concluſion. So ſoon as I heard of the loſs of Fort Waſhington, Fort Lee, Hackenſack and Newark, judging your Excellency would require my preſence, I left the beſt directions I could, for the Surgeons of the General Hoſpital on the eaſt ſide of Hudſon's-River, and haſtened to join you, which I did, the day after you croſſed the Delaware. I was diſtreſſed to find your Excellency entirely deſtitute of Surgeons, at hand, to take charge of the wounded, in caſe of battle.</p>
            <p>With your Excellency's approbation I proceeded to Philadelphia, to lay this matter before Congreſs, and get an explanation of the meaning of their reſolves of October 9th, reſpecting my being ſtationed on the eaſt ſide of Hudſon's-river. I applied to ſeveral members, and requeſted an audience, but, on account of the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of affairs at that time, it was impoſſible to obtain it. The Congreſs was fully employed, and adjoured within a day or two afterwards, to Maryland. The ſick were brought daily to the city, in great numbers, objects of pity. For the care of them, I gave the beſt advice I could, to Dr. Potts, who was employed by the Council of Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for that purpoſe. Several waggon loads of medicines and hoſpital articles, which had been preſerved from fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the enemy's hands, and ſent from New-York to,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:015447_0034_0F998160898D8A98"/>
Newark, and from thence to Philadelphia, were brought to the college, in no good condition. It was my care to collect from them, what was of moſt value, and chiefly wanted for hoſpital uſe, and ſend to Bethlehem. The reſt, by order of Congreſs, were ſhipped to Wilmington and Chriſteen, where I ſent a Surgeon to review and ſee them repacked, in good order, and to make out an invoice of the ſame, and ſend it to Congreſs.</p>
            <p>I returned to head-quarters, and that day received a letter from an honorable member, which I ſhewed to your Excellency, giving it as his judgement, that it was the deſign of Congreſs, I ſhould attend to the care of the ſick on the eaſt ſide of Hudſon's-river, and be reſtricted to that place; which I could not but conſider as a ſingular reſtriction for a Director-General.</p>
            <p>In obedience, however, to this reſolve of Congreſs, I determined to repair to that ſtation, but ſound it neceſſary to take Bethlehem in my way, as my papers and baggage, and moſt of the hoſpital Surgeons and Mates of my department were at that place, and to deliver over to ſome proper perſons, for the uſe of your Excellency's army, the chief articles of the medicines I had ſent there. Of theſe however, I reſerved a few, and comparatively but a few, of ſuch as were wanted, with ſome few ſtores, likewiſe wanted, for the ſick on this ſide, together with my inſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ments and bandages. But your Excellency having ſeen fit to ſend for theſe, by expreſs, they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly diſpatched by the ſame meſſenger.</p>
            <p>Of ten thouſand Bandages I had prepared for uſe in the beginning of the campaign, what with the conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion loſs, ſupplies to the General Hoſpital and regimental Surgeons, few are left.</p>
            <p>The difficulties of attending to the wants and demands of ſo many ſick, ſpread through ſo great a tract of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and the clamors which have been raiſed, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence thereof, have induced me to trouble your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency with this long and particular detail of facts, and to requeſt your Excellency's order for a court of Inquiry,

how the ſick have been taken care of, in the General Hoſpital; compoſed of officers beſt acquainted with the rules and diſcipline of war, and of hoſpital matters; by which it may be known in what manner, agreeable to the eſtabliſhment of our General Hoſpital, by authority of Congreſs, and the inſtructions I have received, from time to time, from Congreſs and your Excellency, and the information and aſſiſtance I have repeatedly applied for, proviſion has been made for the ſick; that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of military hoſpitals, in general; and of ours in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, may be aſcertained; and if the ſick have ſuffered more than was inevitable, from the nature, peculiar hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and difficulties of laſt Campaign, the cauſes may be known, and a ſeaſonable remedy applied, and thoſe on whom any imputations have fallen, either of neglect or miſmanagement, may have an opportuniy of vindicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their proceedings, before a proper tribunal, which is what I intreat for myſelf, and for the department under me.</p>
            <p>I have requeſted Dr. <hi>M'Knight</hi> to take charge of theſe diſpatches, and hope for your Excellency's anſwer, when leiſure will permit; being, with the greateſt deference,</p>

            <p>SENSIBLE of the great difficulties, which have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the department of Director General, owing to a great variety of cauſes that were not in my power to govern, by which the ſick of the army ſuffered very much laſt campaign; I had juſt finiſhed the memorial, which accompanies this containing a narrative of my conduct in that department, with the hope and expectation of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, from your Excellency's known humanity, and love of juſtice, a court of inquiry reſpecting it; that thoſe cauſes might be examined into, and rightly underſtood, and I might have an opportunity of vindicating myſelf, before a juſt and candid tribunal, from any allegations that might be laid at my door, of neglect, or miſconduct in the diſcharge of the duty of my ſtation, according to the beſt of my judgement, knowledge and abilities, when Dr. Foſter called to ſhew <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> your Excellency's order to him, of January 22d. It informed him, that as I was diſmiſſed from the Director-Generalſhip by Congreſs, he was called upon, as eldeſt Surgeon, to take charge of the hoſpitals on the eaſt ſide of the river, till a further no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to that poſt. This diſmiſſion has taken place, without my being ever notified by Congreſs with the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for it, or having been called upon, to anſwer for my conduct, though I had heard from a member, that heavy charges had been brought againſt me, for the ſufferings of the ſick; on which I deſired him to inform Congreſs, that I was ready to ſtand the teſt of an examination, and requeſted an audience, immediately, which I could not be favoured with. This I did verbally, and afterwards applied to Congreſs, through him, by letter, to which I never received any anſwer.</p>
            <p>On this account I drew up the preſent memorial, flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering myſelf I ſhould obtain the wiſhed for inquiry, from your Excellency.</p>

A diſmiſſion by Congreſs from my ſtation, without their having acquainted me with the nature of my ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed offences, and allowed me a previous hearing, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me a very ſevere, if not unuſual proceeding. I am obliged, therefore, ſtill to trouble your Excellency, to requeſt your peruſal of the memorial, and to expreſs my deſire that it may be laid before Congreſs, for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It is natural, therefore, to expect, and what every man has a right to hope for, that he may, though late, be heard with candor and impartiality, and to wiſh that a true ſtate of his conduct in any public department may be known, that according to the evidence of facts it preſents, he may be condemned or acquitted.</p>
            <p>I propoſe to go from hence to Stamford and Norwalk, to deliver up the hoſpital ſtores, with which I have been entruſted, to Dr Foſter's charge, and then proceed, as I have opportunity, to Philadelphia or Baltimore, for the ſettlement of my accounts.</p>
            <p>As I ſhall ſtand in need of aſſiſtance for tranſporting my books, papers and baggage, I flatter myſelf your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency will be pleaſed to give ſuch orders as may enable me to get them removed, without which I may ſuffer great delays and inconvenience.<note n="*" place="bottom">For want of the aſſiſtance, I aſked for all thoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <p>THE nature of my ſtation having led me to make many reflexions, on the ſituation of the ſick, in the army, and the means required for their relief, I have been anxious to lay before your Excellency, what appears to me, to be neceſſary for this purpoſe, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to render the buſineſs of the General Hoſpital more eaſy and compleat. I am deſirous to ſuggeſt to you, what benefits may be ſuppoſed to ariſe, from the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of regimental Surgeons and Mates; what are, and ought to be looked upon, as the duties of their place; to ſhew the inſufficiency of any powers hitherto given them, "by Congreſs or your Excellency," to ſupply the defects "of their ſtation, which they at preſent labour under," without ſome fixed regulations, and without ſome proviſion being made for them, that, for ought I ſee, they are almoſt wholly deſtitute of, and which they are at a loſs how to remedy, and without which they can be of little ſervice to the ſick. This I am willing to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take at large, and to point out ſome plan, for putting it in their power to ſupply the ſick, of their regiments, whilſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to remain under their care, "with whatever is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed requſite for the purpoſe" At the ſame time, I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of pointing out a method of regulating the expences of the General hoſpital, and of furniſhing the ſick in it with many neceſſaries and refreſhments, "which they at preſent want," in the moſt ſuitable and leaſt chargeable ways. To do it properly would be a work of time, and I find little leiſure at preſent for a taſk that would require
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:015447_0040_0F998164EBAB5A10"/>
ſome vacancy from the daily avocations of my buſineſs, to effect. Yet I keep the deſign in view, when other neceſſary calls of duty will permit.</p>
                        <p>"But although I cannot perform this work fully now, yet it is neceſſary to ſay ſomething; our circumſtances and ſituation require a general explanation of what is wanting." The nature and deſign of a General hoſpital is ſo little underſtood, and my particular duty ſo much miſtaken, both by regimental Surgeons and other officers; ſo many expectations are formed, and ſo many things looked for, from me, which are impoſſible to be complied with, that I apprehend it to be abſolutely neceſſary that certain regulations be fixed upon, for the better govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the hoſpital, myſelf, and the Surgeons and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the hoſpital under me, as well as o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>To begin with my own department, I beg leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer your Excellency to the particular duty which is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by the Congreſs to the Director-General, and chief Phyſician of the hoſpital, and to the powers with which he is veſted.</p>
                        <p>His DUTY is to furniſh medicines, bedding, and all other neceſſaries; to pay for the ſame, to ſuperintend the whole, TO MAKE HIS REPORT TO and RECEIVE HIS OR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DERS FROM THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Your Excellency will be pleaſed to obſerve that I have never had "any mention made to me of," nor received the leaſt inſtructions concerning either regimental Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons or regimental ſick; and yet there is not perhaps a ſingle regimental Surgeon, and even but few officers who do not ſuppoſe they have a right to inſiſt upon my furniſhing every regiment, as well the eſtabliſhed ſoldiery, as the militia, with whatever articles they are pleaſed to demand from the hoſpital, as though it was a ſtore

houſe, or magazine for the whole army, "and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, in the intention of its eſtabliſhment, to the purpoſe of taking care of thoſe ſick and wounded, that might be reported to it as proper objects, and admitted accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly." Thus, beſides what medicines are allowed, as well to the militia as to every other regiment in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, regimental Surgeons have a cuſtom of making de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands on the General hoſpital for inſtruments of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, bandages, linnen, tourniquets, wine, rum, ſugar, molaſſes, chocolate, coffee, butter, candles, ſoap, brandy, raiſins, rice, flour, Indian meal and freſh meat. They ſuppoſe I am obliged to comply with any order ſigned by a "regimental" Surgeon or Mate, for thoſe articles, in any quantity they ſee fit to demand. I have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that ſome officers have taken it much amiſs, if they wanted veal or mutton, that they could not have it from the hoſpital, "on ſending for it for their own tables." What is more unaccountable, no regimental Surgeons ever thought it their duty to make any report to me of the ſtate of their ſick, to leave me room to judge of the propriety of iſſuing, or of refuſing to iſſue out whatever ſtores they were pleaſed to call for.</p>
                        <p>To ſhew in what light the hoſpital is viewed, and my duty as Director of it, accounts of ſoldiers that I know nothing of, and who have never been reported to me for directions about them, are ſent to me for payment, and from all quarters, near and afar off. Officers who are ſick in the country, at a diſtance from the army, under coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try practitioners, ſend in their accounts by thoſe Doctors for me to diſcharge.<note n="*" place="bottom">See W. M. Philips's account, ſubjoined to this letter.</note> So numerous and unreaſonable are the demands of officers, regimental Surgeons, "and others, directed by them to the Director-General of the hoſpital for payment," that were all thoſe demands gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, the expences of the ſick, as the Commiſſary-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral hath often remarked, would exceed all the expences of the whole army beſides.</p>
                        <p>"To give a pretext for the propriety of their claims,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:015447_0041_0F99816622DFDF28"/>
they plead their inability of being furniſhed elſewhere with what they want;" the cry of the regimental Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons is, there is no proviſion made for us. "My an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is, nor have I any orders to provide for any but what are under my own direction in the General hoſpital. They aſk where they are to get inſtruments and dreſſings, and what they want for the ſick under their care, or of what uſe are they, if left unprovided. I refer them to their commanding officers, and to make repreſentations of their ſituation to them, to apply to Congreſs to eſtabliſh means of furniſhing what they want; whatever orders are given me, they ſhall be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but I cannot go beyond my inſtructions." Do they imagine that 4 Surgeons and 20 Mates (which are all the Surgeons allowed me in the General hoſpital, for an army of 20000 men) employed in attending all the ſick and wounded that are ſent to them from the whole army, and as they can find, or make lieſure from that employ, conſtantly buſied in preparing lint, bandages, compreſſes, ſplints, tourniquets and other dreſſings for hoſpitals uſe in caſe of any conſiderable action, muſt be ſubjected to their demands, and obliged to unfurniſh the hoſpital, and give up the labour of their hands, to three or four ſcore of regimental Surgeons and Mates, who were to have no trouble themſelves, in making any preparations for their own uſe.</p>
                        <p>Has not your Excellency "recommended the ſtricteſt oeconomy, and" informed me that from the eſtimates given in to Congreſs, it was computed that £. 10,000 per ann. was ſufficient to anſwer all the demands of the General hoſpital, "and that you were apprehenſive the expences already exceeded what was imagined a ſufficiency?" The ſalaries of all the officers in employ, the nurſes and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, nearly equal to half that ſum, without taking into the account the expence of hoſpital furniture, bedding, blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, medicines and inſtruments. From ſuch limited funds, for the ſupport of the General hoſpital, can it be expected that between thirty and forty regiments ſhall
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:015447_0042_0F9981669F352E78"/>
draw ſupplies intended only for the General hoſpital itſelf?</p>
                        <p>In this ſituation, I humbly requeſt your Excellency's inſtructions. "Be pleaſed to conſider that" my COMMIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SION only extends to the care of the HOSPITAL itſelf; and yet every regimental Surgeon, apparently, expects me to ſupply him with whatever he wants, and to prepare every thing to his hand, or to lay the odium of his defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency at my door.</p>
                        <p>This application of mine does not proceed from any deſire or inclination to ſhrink from any ſervice I can render them; but, if this ſervice (contrary to my preſent duty) is required of me, the means muſt be eſtabliſhed, and I muſt receive poſitive inſtructions for it, leſt I be deemed guilty of neglecting, or not ſufficiently providing for my own department, for the ſake of thoſe who are not comprehended within it.</p>
                        <p>On the whole, I think it my duty to repreſent to your Excellency, that I have thought it incumbent on me, to give directions to the ſtores-keepers of the General hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital to iſſue no ſtores from thence, on the bare order of any regimental Surgeon, except Indian meal, rice or oatmeal, and if they want wine, rum, ſugar, or other the like ſtores, they muſt produce an order for theſe, counterſigned by me, and take a receipt for the ſame, to make them accountable for the diſpoſal of what they thus receive, if called upon. I have directed the apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary to iſſue out medicines to them, for the uſe of each regiment, in ſuch quantities, as their preſent occaſions may require, but ſo as not to unfurniſh the hoſpital, or exhauſt the ſtock, faſter than I can get a freſh ſupply. To enable, you, Sir, to form ſome judgment of what is neceſſary for the purpoſe, I muſt obſerve that ſuch an army as is now on foot, will require an additional ſum of two thouſand pounds ſterling per annum at leaſt for the uſe of the regimental Surgeons, over and above what is neceſſary for the ſupply of the General hoſpital itſelf. And it will be for ever needy, and even deſtitute of capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:015447_0042_0F9981669F352E78"/>
medicines, if not ſpeedily furniſhed with a freſh ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, to the amount of two or three thouſand pounds: medicines being very ſcarce and dear.</p>
                        <p>Another obſervation I beg leave to make is, that every regiment ought to have a ſmall portable cheſt, for the whole year at once, and be provided with inſtruments, bandages and dreſſings.</p>
                        <p>It is not with any view to reflect upon the regimental Surgeons, but for the better purpoſe of procuring them relief from their difficulties, that I am obliged to inform your Excellency, that there are but very few of them, as far as I can learn, who have what can be called even a tolerable ſupply of any, even the moſt eſſential articles for regimental Surgeons, inſtruments or bandages, and that they are deluding themſelves with a falſe opinion, that in caſe of action, every regimental Surgeon will be immediately furniſhed with thoſe articles from the hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital. I fear, from this circumſtances, moſt of them would be extremely at a loſs what to do, or be even uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in a battle.</p>
                        <p>I would therefore recommend to your Excellency, that "a perſon be appointed for the purpoſe," and inſtructions given for furniſhing a regimental cheſt of medicines, with inſtruments, lint, tow and bandages, &amp;c. for each regiment; that orders be iſſued, that every regimental Surgeon make out a report of what he has of thoſe articles in readineſs, and a repreſentation of what he may further want, to be collected together, in order to judge of their preſent deficiencies; and that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimental cheſts be inſpected from time to time. As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual complaints are made of the ignorance and unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of many called regimental Surgeons and Mates for that poſt, and I find them generally unacquainted with what duties are to be expected of them, in that ſtation; I would adviſe, "if it be thought practicable under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent circumſtances," that ſome kind of examination be made of their reſpective abilities, by a choſen committee; being a practice obſerved in all countries, which is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:015447_0043_0F998167AB8D5E48"/>
to the ſervice, and is now eſtabliſhed in the middle colonies.</p>
                        <p>"I have been amazed to hear it ſaid, and that it ſhould have been thought, even by ſome members of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, that little uſe was expected from regimental Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, where there was a General hoſpital; and this has been given to me as a reaſon for their being ſo much ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, or ſo ill provided with the means of being uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and is, perhaps, the beſt reaſon that can be given that there are comparatively ſo few amongſt them, at preſent, of any tolerable education, experience or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the buſineſs and duties of the ſtation." Before I put an end to this letter, I muſt beg your indulgence whilſt I trouble your Excellency with two obſervations more. The firſt is, that regimental hoſpitals and regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Surgeons, under proper regulations and ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to the General hoſpital, are abſolutely neceſſary, and, in my opinion, may be made extremely ſerviceable in an army; ſecondly, were matters ſo well regulated that whenever any ſoldier was taken ill, whether ſent to the General hoſpital, or whether he continued with his regiment, under the care of his proper Surgeon; if his rations were ſtopped for the time, and paid for in money, it would, in my opinion, be ſufficient or nearly ſo, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he was dieted as he ought to be for a ſick man, and as he is directed to be, in the General hoſpital, not only to pay for his diet, but to ſupply him with every neceſſary refreſhment without any, "or with little" addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional expence to the publick, from the ſtores of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral hoſpital. To prove this, may require an explanation, which I ſhall willingly give when called for.<note n="*" place="bottom">

Permit me, Sir, to conclude with this remark that if the ſick in regiments are to be ſupplied at a public expence, that expence ought to be a regimental charge, and may well enough be included in the abſtract of the regiment. The General hoſpital having nothing to do with regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental ſick, till they are reported to, and admitted as proper objects, ought not to be burdened with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. In this manner, the expence of "main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the ſick in regimental hoſpitals will be known," and that of ſupporting a General hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, unmixed with the former, may be pretty exactly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained from experience; nor would it be charged with enormous accounts, which the General hoſpital, proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeaking, has nothing to do with.</p>

                           <p>(<hi>b</hi>) P. S. I would obſerve to your Excellency, that the ſum allowed by Congreſs for the payment of the ſtore-keepers is ſo inſignificant as four dollars a month; about half the wages of a common ſoldier; though it is a place of great truſt, and requires talents and applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to buſineſs, as well as integrity to perform it well.</p>
                           <p>The pay of nurſes is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ixt by Congreſs at half a dollar per week. Whilſt it is ſo low, we ſhall never be able to furniſh good nurſes, or in ſhort any nurſes, in proportion to the number wanted for the ſick. They complain of
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:015447_0044_0F998167E4462200"/>
their pay, and are jealous that more is allowed, but that part of it is ſtopped: Moſt of them ſay they were promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a dollar per week. I have only paid them what is allowed by my inſtructions.</p>
                           <p>There is a neceſſity for having occaſional officers in the General hoſpital, of whom no mention is made in the eſtabliſhment by Congreſs. Some ſuch I have found here on my arrival. They remain without pay, nor is their pay ſettled. I have neither confirmed their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, nor have I diſmiſſed them, inſtructions being wanted.</p>
                           <p>It is neceſſary that I report to your Excellency the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of five Mates from the General hoſpital, as, by order of Congreſs, they were only employed by the day; and they have refuſed to ſubmit to any examination of their qualifications.</p>

            <p>From the Doctor's viſits and accounts (which muſt be confeſſed to be very low) compared with the diet, ſalt pork, wine and rum, &amp;c. it muſt appear how neceſſary ſuch an expenſive attendance was for a private ſoldier, in the ſmall-pox, and what idea was entertained of the duty of a Director-General, if liable to pay ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.</p>
            <p>I had alſo before me, at this time, a copy of the drafts of one regimental Surgeon at Cambridge, upon the ſtore of the General Hoſpital, for above an hundred gallons, or an hogſhead of rum; wine, loaf and brown ſugar, and molaſſes in proportion; and to ſhew the extreme neceſſity, one pint of oatmeal was added to the liſt, being for one regiment only; all within the ſpace of about ſix weeks; and yet there was no return made of the ſick, but all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded on the faith of an order, ſigned by a regimental Surgeon or Mate.</p>
            <p>I ſhall here likewiſe, remark, that, when after regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Surgeons were repeatedly called upon, by general orders, to make reports of the ſtate of the ſick, although many of them never complied at all with thoſe orders,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:015447_0045_0F998169D72B7908"/>
amongſt thoſe who did make their returns, ſome indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals reported above an hundred, each. But when Doctor Foſter, then Surgeon in the General hoſpital, attended, by my directions, to viſit, in particular, Col. Parſons's regiment, of which the Surgeon was ſuddenly taken ill, in order to receive ſuch as were proper objects, into the General hoſpital; on calling over the liſt by name to examine their caſes, there were but few of them, who were not found, and did not acknowledge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to be fit for duty.</p>
            <p>In ſome returns, of which I took care to keep the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals, forty waiters and upwards were included on the ſick liſt, to exempt ſo many from duty. Some regimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Surgeons made a practice of ſelling recommendations to furloughs and diſcharges; for which only one, out of the number ſuppoſed to merit that diſtinction, was drummed out of the army, for ſuch mean and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous practices Had all who deſerved it, met the ſame reward, it would have reduced the liſt very conſiderably. Cordials and refreſhments were drawn by others, from the ſtores of the General hoſpital, which by the parts ſome of the officers took in ſupporting the unreaſonable demands of thoſe men, gave room for many to believe they ſhared in the plunder themſelves.</p>
            <p>Is it any wonder, on being repeatedly informed of theſe particulars, that I put a total ſtop to the unauthoriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed practice of the regimental Surgeons drawing ſtores from the General hoſpital, without obliging them to be accountable for the ſame? Is it a matter of ſurprize that regimental Surgeons and officers of that caſt, ſhould manifeſt a declared enmity againſt one, who contravened their ſhameful meaſures; or that they ſhould have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence with ſome of the privates, in concert with whom they preyed on the vitals of the publick, to declaim againſt the General hoſpital, whilſt thoſe who were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per objects for it, and had once experienced the benefit of that inſtitution, were glad to have recourſe to it, as often as they ſtood in need?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="unknown:015447_0046_0F99816B15788178"/>
When the eſtimate of hoſpital expences was ſo very low, and ſuch oeconomy, for I may not call it parſimony, was manifeſted in the pay allowed to the hoſpital officers by former reſolves of Congreſs, ſo different from the generous munificence of the preſent day, that four dollars per month, was then thought a ſufficiency for the hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſtore-keepers. [Great proof of its being the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Congreſs, that they ſhould iſſue ſtores, to the amount of many hundred thouſand dollars per annum, to regimental Surgeons;] is it any wonder that I would not ſuffer regimental Surgeons to draw, <hi>ad libitum,</hi> for whatever their unbounded appetites and fancies craved from the General hoſpital; or, when I diſcovered ſo many arts, put in practice, to defraud the publick, that I would pay no accounts of ſoldiers, out of the hoſpital, contracted without my knowledge, and out of the ſphere of my department? Had I allowed myſelf to be drawn into this ſnare, who can tell what limits they would have ſet to their growing demands? Some large accounts of private practitioners, were brought to me; from more than an hundred miles diſtance. Some of them had charged near five pounds, a day, for attendance on com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſoldiers, who ailed but little. Had I paſſed thoſe accounts would it not have been at the riſk of my own reputation? but why mention reputation? Have I not ſuffered more obloquy from the malignity of ſuch men, on account of ſaving prodigious ſums to the Continent, with great toil, but no poſſible advantage to myſelf, than ſome others for engulphing the public monies? Such are the rewards of care and exactneſs in buſineſs to ſerve one's country; glorious pledges of liberty! when offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of rank are to be forced from their ſtations, to make way for undermining and ambitious men, on their partial repreſentations, without any hearing! <hi>oh fortunatos <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

For example, When it was thought neceſſary to eſtabliſh a General hoſpital above Kingſbridge, in the neighbourhood of that wing of the army commanded by Major-General HEATH, in October, after the proper places were pitched upon for that deſign, I called upon the Deputy-Quarter-Maſter-General for workmen and materials, to put the ſeveral houſes in order, to build chimnies, to conſtruct births, and to make ſuitable apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the ſick and wounded. The Q. M. General being then at Philadelphia, the D. Q. M. General in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me that every carpenter and maſon under his direction in the army were engroſſed, and could not be taken off from their preſent employ. He adviſed me to make application to General HEATH, for an order, to obtain as many of the militia, or other ſoldiers who were proper workmen, to be drafted from their reſpective re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments under his command, as would ſuffice for the preſent occaſion. I ſent to General HEATH for this purpoſe. The anſwer I received was, that the General did not chuſe to meddle with any thing to be done in the Quarter-Maſter-Generals department. When General MIFFLIN, Quarter-Maſter-General, returned ſome time after from Philadelphia, where he was then gone, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured an order from him on his Deputy, for a dozen carpenters and maſons; but they could not be ſpared from other buſineſs; and not one was ſent to me all the time I remained on York-Iſland, from the biginning of October, to the time of my going over to Hackinſack, after the middle of the month, when the army began to retreat to the White Plains.</p>
            <p>The ſame thing happened frequently at other times and places particularly at North Caſtle; when, after ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt applications made by myſelf and the Surgeons of the General hoſpital, to that department, and orders were given by the Quarter-Maſter-General himſelf, or his Deputy, on the Commander of the Artificers, they could
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:015447_0047_0F9982B0A1904130"/>
not be procured, it being always declared that all hands were engaged by prior orders, for other purpoſes of the army. I do not mention theſe difficulties with a view to reflect upon, either the Quarter-Maſter-General, or his Deputy. Men of greater activity, or greater abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for the reſpective poſts, I do not imagine can be produced: Nor were they wanting in inclination to give me all the aſſiſtance they were capable of affording. But if they had it not in their power, ſtill the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences were no leſs on account of that inclination; yet was I to ſuffer, and be blamed for wants which neither the whole army, nor perhaps the Congreſs itſelf; at leaſt no other perſons were capable of making a timely proviſion for, and to be anſwerable, as it would ſeem for all the misfortunes of the campaign?</p>
            <p>When I was at Hackinſack I was expreſsly forbidden by the General, to draft any workmen from the army. My whole dependence was placed on ſuch as I could meet with in the country, and which I ought to have had from the Quarter-Maſter-General's department; few were to be found in the neighbourhood of the army, when affairs went on otherwiſe than proſperouſly. Nor had I any company or guards allotted to me, for any purpoſes of the General Hoſpital, when I firſt went to Hackinſack, and men were wanting to go after proviſions and for other neceſſaries, beſides waiting on the ſick and wounded, that were hourly brought in great numbers, without any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whatever to attend them.</p>
            <p>Once, indeed, when the ſick became very numerous, about ten days before the retreat from New-York, and when I ſtood in greater need than uſual, of an increaſe of labourers and waiters in the General Hoſpital, and there were no men to be had in the city, who were will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to engage in that ſervice, after repeated applications for that purpoſe, it was given out in general orders, that fifty men ſhould be drafted from the line, who were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted to that duty. No day paſſed without making per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal application myſelf, to the officers appointed to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect

               </gap> his order, yet a week paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was complied with. When the men were parad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and marched to the New-York college, to receive their orders from me, at what hoſpitals they were to be employed, and how to be diſpoſed of, they declared they would not remain there. They ſaid they were cheated, having been told they were ordered for quite a different duty. I reaſoned with them, and ſhewed the neceſſity there was of their help, promiſed to make their ſervices as eaſy and agreeable to them as poſſible, and to allow them each a gill of rum per day, if they behaved well, and threatened them, if they left me, to report them as guilty of diſobeying the General's orders. They feigned acquieſcence. Yet, by next day, moſt of them had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted from the hoſpital, and returned to their companies, although, beſides the ſick, there were near one hundred wounded to attend. Such was the diſcipline of the army at that time. Before I could take any ſtep to have theſe men called to account, I was ordered over to Newark, to provide accommodations for the ſick at that place, in the midſt of which, great part of the remaining Waiters, and ſome of the Nurſes left the hoſpital.</p>
            <p>AS the following letters, ſelected from a number of others, written by me, to different members of Congreſs, on the buſineſs of my department, bear teſtimony to the pains I took to give full and timely information to that Body, of the ſtate of the ſick in the General hoſpital and the army, of the deficiencies and inconveniences both la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured under, for want of ſuitable regulations, and of what ſupplies were wanting, in time for affording more effectual relief, at leaſt in many inſtances, had that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation been duly attended to by Congreſs, I need not make any apology for publiſhing them in this place, at full length, and in their original dreſs I am not ſure, if I were to give only extracts, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

nor did I expect at the time they were written, that I ſhould ever think it neceſſary to print them. Beſides, in buſineſs of ſo much importance, I imagine it will be conſidered as a leſs fault, to be minute and particular, and even to repeat the ſame things, in the hurry of writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than to give ſo curſory a relation, as to fail of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the deſign of affording full information of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever falls under the writer's notice, that may inform thoſe in office of the true ſtate of his department, and be any further inducement to them, than they already have, to exert themſelves, in giving all the timely aſſiſtance that is needful, to remedy every want, or remove every incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience under which it labours.</p>
            <p>On my arrival from Cambridge, at New-York, the latter end of May, 1776, I found ſeveral orders, drawn upon me, from the Northern Army, for ſupplies of medicines and inſtruments, and particularly for a large ſupply of medicines from Doctor Stringer, Director in that department. I heard from a number of officers, of great rank, who were juſt returned from Philadelphia, that Congreſs expected me, as Director General, to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the neceſſary ſupplies of Hoſpital ſtores, for the Northern department. I had received no ſuch orders. As I thought proper regulations were wanting, to aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the reſpective limits of authority, intended by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs to be veſted in myſelf, and the ſeveral Directors, I requeſted leave to go to Philadelphia, to obtain an audience of a committee of Congreſs, on that ſubject, which I obtained. I left propoſals of ſeveral regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with that committee, for introducing order into the different branches of the General Hoſpital depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Amongſt others, I propoſed that the ſeveral Directors and Superintendants of Hoſpitals, ſhould be ordered and impowered to provide their reſpective de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments with Hoſpital ſtores, without depending on me for ſupplies; it being impoſſible for me, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced as I was, to anſwer their demands. Nothing was determined till a month afterwards. In the mean

while, upon my return to New-York, Doctor Potts, who had a ſeparate charge of certain Hoſpitals, which were to be eſtabliſhed to the Northward, applyed to me for the appointment of Surgeons and other Hoſpital officers to act under him, and for a farther ſupply of medicines, than he had yet obtained. He expreſſed it as his opinion, that he was obliged, in duty, to look to me for aſſiſtance, and ſaid he ſhould depend upon me only, as head of the department, for every thing of which he ſhould ſtand in need. At the ſame time, Doctor Lind, applied to me for medicines, for General Sullivan's army, on which, I wrote the following Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THE ſtate of the army in Canada, according to Dr. Lind's account, (who is juſt arrived from thence, by order of General Sullivan, for a ſupply of medicines,) is truly deplorable. I have ſeen no return of the ſick, but he aſſures me, that in the beginning of this month, there were no leſs than 1800 men down with the ſmall-pox; and the total of ſick and unfit for duty, amounted to 3,300 men; and he ſays, they have no medicines: Such a report is ſcarcely credible, but you may learn the particulars, yourſelf, from him, as he intends going to Philadelphia.</p>
                  <p>General Gates ſets out to-morrow, to take the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the army in Canada. Dr. Potts will accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:015447_0049_0F99829C722B6240"/>
him. I have therefore given orders to ſupply him, from the General Hoſpital, with a large cheſt of ſuch medicines as I can beſt ſpare; and which can be got ready to-morrow before his departure. Upon looking into Dr. Potts's commiſſion, I find he is appointed Phyſician and Surgeon in the department of Canada; but whether it be of a regiment, or in the Hoſpital, is not ſpecified; nor does it ſhew whether it is the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Congreſs, to veſt him with the power of a Director, in the General Hoſpital: Nor can I learn, what appointment Dr. Stringer has, or what is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his commiſſion.</p>
                  <p>From all I am able to learn, every thing in the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal department, in Canada, diſplays one ſcene of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and anarchy: Nor have the Congreſs taken upon itſelf, to eſtabliſh, or veſted any perſon whatever, with a power ſufficient to eſtabliſh a General Hoſpital in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada.</p>
                  <p>The Congreſs cannot, in my humble opinion, be too ſpeedy in determining what ſteps are to be taken for this purpoſe, and for ſettling a due ſubordination amongſt the Surgeons there. It would be of particular uſe, that the intentions of Congreſs were made known in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Dr. Stringer and Dr. Potts, whether either of them is to be conſidered as Director, by appointment of Congreſs, and which of them; or whether they are both to be looked upon as Surgeons depending on, and acting by inſtructions from me. I have never ſeen Dr. Stringer's commiſſion. In either caſe, they will require more help than they have at preſent; and in the latter, I ſuppoſe I ought to have the appointment of three or four more Hoſpital Surgeons, an Apothecary, and a ſufficiency of Mates in that department, without dim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the number I have allowed me for the army at New-York, as I have none here that are ſuperfluous. Other officers, as a Storekeeper, Stewart and Matron, are alſo wanted in Canada, with Nurſes and occaſional Labourers. Whatever is determined on, in reſpect to
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:015447_0049_0F99829C722B6240"/>
theſe matters, I ſhould be glad to know immediately: Till then, my hands are tied up, and the army ſuffering for want of help. I am not ſure that our diſgrace and misfortunes in Canada are not owing, in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to the ſhameful proceedings of the Surgeons, in ſpreading the ſmall-pox by innoculation, amongſt the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery, in face of the enemy. Inſtead of innoculating the ſoldiery, under like circumſtances before Boſton, General Waſhington, upon my repreſentation, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to keep in pay a Surgeon and Mate, to attend all that fell ill of the ſmall-pox. A Hoſpital was fixed for their reception only, in a retired place, and a guard ſet round it, and all communication betwixt it and the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was cut off; and ſo ſoon as any one was ſeized with the infection, of whatever rank, he was ſent to the ſmall-pox Hoſpital. By this means, every inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ariſing from the appearance of the ſmall-pox, was prevented, and the army effectually ſecured from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, from that quarter.</p>
                  <p>Had there been a General Hoſpital in Canada, there would have been better orders, and ſome ſubordination obſerved, which is now wholly wanting; and it is to be feared, that whilſt the Congreſs, occupied in a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of weighty concerns, can proceed but ſlowly on this matter, the opportunity may be loſt. Rather than poſtpone, however, ſo important a concern, would it not be right to place full confidence and power in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per perſon, capable to arrange theſe matters, as they ought to be, with ample authority for the purpoſe, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than ſuffer a loſs of men, to the diſcouragement of the whole army, for want of a due proviſion being made for the ſick and wounded.</p>
                  <p>If the Congreſs will ſix on the means and manner of eſtabliſhing a General Hoſpital at Canada, it will eaſe me of much trouble; but if they are not at leiſure, or not ſufficiently acquainted with what is the proper manner, and will order me to do it for them, giving me ſuch power as they think adequate, I will do the beſt I can,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:015447_0050_0F99829D4A296508"/>
to effect this deſirable end immediately. Excuſe, Sir, my dwelling ſo earneſtly on this ſubject; it is of the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt conſequence to the ſervice, and delays are danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. I cannot expect to receive inſtructions, on this matter, from General Waſhington; he ſuppoſes, that I underſtand the affairs of this department, and relies wholly on me for every thing which relates to it. <hi>But I neither durſt, nor will I preſume, to meddle in affairs, out of my province, or that are beyond the ſphere, in which I ſuppoſe, I was deſigned originally, by Congreſs, to move.</hi>—Such, I imagine, is the arrangement of Hoſpital affairs, in Canada, and the undertaking to ſupply the Surgeons there with what is neceſſary for a General Hoſpital, without freſh inſtructions, or more ample power than I now have, either from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs or Commander in Chief, as my commiſſion directs me to look to them, for orders.</p>
                  <p>I wait, impatiently, for an order from Congreſs, to impower me to demand ſuch a proportion of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental medicines, left in the care of Meſſieurs De Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Smith, as they may think fit to allot for this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment. In determining that proportion, they will pleaſe to conſider (if we can truſt to Dr. Lind's account) that there is not an article of medicine in Canada, in the hands of any Surgeon on that expedition.</p>

It being the duty of the Regimental Surgeons and Mates, in caſe of action, in the field, to attend the Corps to which they belong, in order to dreſs the wounded in battle; they are to take poſt in the rear of the troops engaged in action, at the diſtance of three, four, or five hundred yards behind ſome convenient hill, if at hand, there to dreſs the wounded, who require to be dreſſed, on or near the field of battle If the Regiment or Corps to which they belong, are engaged within a fort, or lines thrown up for defence, that fort or place of defence, is then the proper ſtation for the Regimental Surgeons: But as a Regiment may be divided, and diſtributed into different poſts, ſo as to render it impracticable for the Regiment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Surgeon and Mate, belonging to that Regiment, to be near ſome parts of their Corps, it is neceſſary that, an account of the number of Surgeons and Mates, in any Brigade, or any diviſion of the army, that occupies one or more detached poſts, be taken, and delivered to the Commanding Officer of ſaid poſts or diviſion. It is to be conſidered as the duty of each Regimental Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon and Mate reſpectively, wherever ſtationed, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard himſelf, as having a joint charge of the whole Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade, with the reſt of the Surgeons of that Brigade, rather than as if his care was to be confined only to thoſe officers and ſoldiers who are of the Regiment to
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:015447_0052_0F99829E62123AA0"/>
which he belongs. It muſt unavoidably happen, at times, that both officers and ſoldiers may be wounded in action, and their particular Surgeons be elſewhere employed, ſo as not to be able to attend them. The amputation of a limb, or performance of any capital operation, cannot well take place in the heat of a briſk action: It is ſeldom poſſible, or requiſite. What the Surgeon has chiefly to attend to in caſes of perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much wounded in the field of battle, is to ſtop any flux of blood, either by tourniquet, ligature, lint and compreſs, or a ſuitable bandage, as the caſe may require; to remove any extraneous body from the wound; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce fractured bones; to apply proper dreſſings to wounds; taking care on the one hand, not to bind up the parts too tightly, ſo as to injure the blood's circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, increaſe inflammation, and excite a fever; or ſo looſely, as to endanger the wounds bleeding afreſh, or to allow broken bones, after they are properly ſet, to be again diſplaced. The wounded being thus dreſſed by the Regimental Surgeons, are next to be removed to the neareſt Hoſpital belonging to the Brigade, or to the General Hoſpital, as may be moſt convenient.</p>
                        <p>As the General Hoſpital may at times, be fully croud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſick perſons, or in the time of action, ſo many wounded may be ſent there, as to require a greater number of hands, than that part of the General Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, where many of the wounded are ſent, is furniſhed with, it may be abſolutely neceſſary for the ſuperintend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Surgeon, beſides the proportion allowed him, from the General Hoſpital, to call for the aſſiſtance of a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Surgeons and Mates, from the Brigade, diviſion or part of the army where he is, either before an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, or, when the number of wounded perſons ſent to him becomes very great, making ſuch aſſiſtance needful. For this purpoſe, he is to apply to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of that Brigade, or part of the army, who is hereby ordered to ſend him as many Regimental Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:015447_0053_0F99829F92BC6EB8"/>
and Mates, for that purpoſe, as are required, and can be ſpared from their poſts.</p>
                        <p>To prevent confuſion, and that the Regimental Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons may know the better what part of duty is expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them, ſome one, at leaſt, of the Surgeons, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially thoſe fixed at out poſts, are directed, as ſoon as poſſible, to call upon and arrange matters, in time, with the Hoſpital Surgeons neareſt at hand, in behalf of the Brigade, or Corps acting together, that no diſorder may ariſe, in time of action, for want of ſo neceſſary a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution. The Regimental Surgeons ought to call on the officers of the Corps to which they belong, to ſettle with them, what perſons are to be employed in carrying off the wounded, and for a ſupply of wheel-barrows, or other more convenient biers, for conveying them from the field of battle, to the place appointed for reception of the wounded, or General Hoſpital. Each Regiment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Surgeon and Mate ought to have a portable box, with ſuitable diviſions for containing his lint, bandages, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, and other implements of Surgery, which ought to be well provided with every neceſſary.</p>
                        <p>In applying a common tourniquet to ſtop the flow of blood, from any principal artery in a limb, till it can be otherwiſe properly ſecured, care muſt be taken not to twiſt it too tightly about the limb; and to prevent the tourniquet from ſlipping, ſo as to endanger a freſh loſs of blood, it muſt be faſtened with a ligature of thread or tape.</p>

            <p>IN conſequence of the foregoing plan and orders, ſome reports were made, although <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>y came in but ſlowly. Near a fortnight paſſed over before I received them from more than fifteen Regimental Surgeons: It is to be aſcribed, if not to that backwardneſs which the Regimental Surgeons ever ſhewed to complying with
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:015447_0053_0F99829F92BC6EB8"/>
General Orders, perhaps, to a conſcious ſhame of being entirely deſtitute of any neceſſary articles, but what they had been previouſly indulged to draw from the General Hoſpital: Some of them, whom I afterwards met, and inquired into the cauſe of their neglect, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed this to be the truth. As my intention in deſiring thoſe reports to be made to me, was, to lay them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the General and Congreſs, with remarks on their inſufficiency, that the Medical Committee might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to uſe more diligence, than heretofore, to fall on ſome meaſures for ſupplying the Regimental Surgeons, with every neceſſary to qualify them for greater uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in their ſtation. I drew up, from the ſeparate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports delivered to me, one general return of the ſtate of the abovementioned fifteen Regiments. All the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments were reported to be private property, and amounted to ſix ſets of amputating inſtruments, two of trepanning ditto, fifteen caſes of pocket inſtruments, ſeventy-five crooked, and ſix ſtrait needles. Amongſt the whole fifteen Surgeons, there were only four ſcalp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els or inciſion knives, for dilating of wounds, or any other purpoſe; three pair of forceps, for extracting bullets; half a paper and ſeventy pins; and but few bandages, ligatures or tourniquets, and as little old lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, lint or tow, but what they had procured from the General Hoſpital; and only two ounces of ſpunge in all. Amazing deficiency for fifteen Surgeons, and as many Mates!</p>
            <p>Upon inquiry how they could think of marching with their Regiments, without providing, at leaſt, old linnen for dreſſings; or of joining the army, without the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary inſtruments, as, if ever they reflected at all, they muſt be ſenſible of the impropriety of ſo doing, and of its being much eaſier for each man, to procure thoſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, within the ſphere of his acquaintance, connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions or neighbourhood, than to obtain them in an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, in general, deſtitute of neceſſary ſupplies, of what was not to be procured in America, but with great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty.
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:015447_0054_0F9982A01A7ACF00"/>
Their conſtant anſwer was, whenever they applied to their ſuperior officers for thoſe things, they were always told, they would be furniſhed with every thing they wanted, ſo ſoon as they ſhould have joined the army. Upon being informed that I had only a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of thoſe articles for the uſe of the General Hoſpital, and that I would by no means unfurniſh it, to ſupply them, they appeared quite confounded, and expreſſed great uneaſineſs, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> having no proper eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment; and ſaid, they knew not how, or where to obtain the neceſſary articles, to be any ways uſeful in the army, if I did not aſſiſt them.</p>
            <p>As I was not ignorant of the many inconveniencies, under which they had hitherto laboured, from a want of attention in the Congreſs to relieve, or place them on a better footing, and as I felt for their diſtreſs, I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured them of my readineſs to aſſiſt them, all in my power, conſiſtently with my proper duty, and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders I had, or ſhould receive from Congreſs. I adviſed them to meet in a body; to converſe on the matter with each other; and then chuſe one or more Deputies, from each Brigade, to ſtate their helpleſs ſituation, and pray for relief; in which I was willing to ſecond their application, with all the influence of which I was maſter.</p>
            <p>As they complained much of not being allowed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Regimental Hoſpitals, and, as I had, in oppoſition to what always appeared to me to be the ſentiments, both of the Congreſs and General, ever uniformly given it as my opinion, that Regimental Surgeons and Regimental Hoſpitals, under proper regulations, and due ſubordination to the General Hoſpital, might be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uſeful, I took that matter under my conſideration. I likewiſe drew up a memorial, and propoſals, to be ſhewn to the General, for his approbation and concurrence, to be laid before Congreſs. At the ſame time, I penned for the uſe of the Regimental Surgeons, a form, and directions for keeping a proper regiſter of the ſick, and
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:015447_0054_0F9982A01A7ACF00"/>
for making every kind of neceſſary returns of ſick, proviſions, &amp;c. alſo tables of the various kinds of diet, uſed in the General Hoſpital, as an example for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to copy after, under the heads of full diet, half diet, low diet, milk diet and fever diet, with the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of calculating the differences betwixt theſe, and the amount of the well rations; to enable them to draw the value of the difference, whether in caſh or refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but for the uſe of the ſick only: And I ſhewed them a liſt of what inſtruments, bandages, ligatures, lint, tow, old linnen and other articles, I eſteemed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for a Regiment; which I ſhall ſubjoin to the ſubſtance of the memorial and petition to Congreſs, and the propoſals I had ſketched out for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
            <p>At the firſt meeting I had with them, by appointment, to confer on theſe ſeveral particulars, before I produced the papers referred to, I addreſſed them in theſe words, which I had written, and of which I kept the original.</p>

To anſwer this end, I have conſidered what is within our power, as matters now ſtand, and what we are to aim at, for further improvement; and have, by a train of reflexions on the ſubject, been led, in the firſt place, to propoſe certain regulations which appear to me to be both ſalutary and practicable, if they meet with your

Hoſpital, with a Director General, four Surgeons and twenty Mates, there was no mention of the Regimental Surgeons and Mates, nor any proviſion made for them, either of medicines, inſtruments, or other neceſſaries; yet they were kept in pay.—That, in this ſituation, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it might be preſumed the Hoſpital Surgeons and Mates, appointed to take care of the ſick and wounded, were ſcarcely ſufficient to attend ſo great a number of patients as an unhealthy ſeaſon, or an active campaign might produce; yet the Regimental Surgeons and Mates, for want of a ſuitable proviſion, muſt, in their preſent ſituation, be very uſeleſs; although they were ſo much more numerous than the Hoſpital Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons and Mates, and always profeſſed an ardent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of being properly employed, and of anſwering the deſign of their appointment.—That not knowing where elſe to look for relief, they had applied to the Director-General, who aſſured them of his inclination to ſerve them; but having no orders to iſſue out ſupplies to them, and it being unuſual for Regimental Surgeons to depend upon the General Hoſpital for all they wanted, he had adviſed them to make application to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in Chief, or Congreſs, for eſtabliſhing a proper method to obtain ſupplies, promiſing to ſecond their applications, with the warmeſt repreſentations from himſelf—That it was with his advice, the preſent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial was drawn up, to lay before Congreſs.—That he had given them ſeveral meetings, and a ſet of propoſals were agreed upon, as regulations, provided they met with the approbation of Congreſs, which were incloſed for conſideration; praying for ſuch relief on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           <salute>GENTLEMEN,</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>HAVING put the General hoſpital on a good footing at New-York, and provided it with a pretty conſiderable ſtock of what it may ſtand in need of (as a general hoſpital) I have thought it my duty to turn my attention to the regimental Surgeons. Their ſituation, ever ſince I have been in the army, has been ſuch as to require a great deal of regulation.</p>
                        <p>If I were to confine myſelf to the true and proper buſineſs of Director General of the hoſpital, I ſhould have very little concerns with them as regimental Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, according to the plan of the Britiſh eſtabliſhment. It would be principally confined to the receiving ſuch ſick from them, into the General hoſpital, as they could not take care of themſelves; to aſſiſt in the examination of ſuch as offered themſelves candidates for the places of Surgeons and Mates; and to give orders to them to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelves with proper medicinal cheſts, for each regiment, and all the inſtrnments and implements neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for them to be provided with, and ſee it done. The making proviſion of thoſe articles ſhould depend on themſelves; but they ought to be ſupplied with the means, whether by an allowance of money adequate to the proviſion, or by a ſtoppage from the mens pay.</p>
                        <p>I found them, upon enquiry, deſtitute of every arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, whether of medicines, inſtruments, bandages or other implements of ſurgery; and not knowing where to provide what was neceſſary, or who to look to for aſſiſtance.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="68" facs="unknown:015447_0058_0F9982A3DB6CE3A8"/>
With a view to promote the ſervice all that lay in my power, I have attempted to bring them together, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine into the ſtate of their wants; to point out what they ought to be furniſhed with; to direct them where to look for ſupplies; and to bring them under ſome proper regulations.</p>
                        <p>To anſwer theſe ſeveral purpoſes, I began, by requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the General to iſſue out orders for each Surgeon, to make a return of what medicines he had on hand. To my ſorrow, I muſt ſay it, excepting two or three Regiments, the ſtock of all the Regiments at Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge put together, would ſcarcely have made one good cheſt. I procured all I could get at Boſton, and have, from thence, and from ſome purchaſes of ſhops at Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem and ſome articles I got at Newport, Norwich and New-York, furniſhed Regimental cheſts to all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimental Surgeons, who have hitherto applied, to the amount of near twenty; and am ſtill furniſhing all the new regiments that daily come in.</p>
                        <p>In the next place, I ſketched out a plan of conduct, for the Surgeons of Regiments in caſe of action, of which the General approved, and gave out in orders, that they ſhould attend, and take directions from me, on that head<note n="*" place="bottom">See that plan and orders of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                                 <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                              </gap> Page 50.</note>. At the ſame time, I deſired a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to be delivered in, of their Surgeons inſtruments, and bandages fit for uſe, agreeable to a form give them for the purpoſe. Fifteen Regimental Surgeons made their returns accordingly; from which I have drawn up one general return, to ſhew the amount: I ſuppoſe them to be, at leaſt, as well provided as any others, that have neglected to pay due attention to the order; and do find, that the Regiments now coming in have Surgeons and Mates, but not one article of medicine, or any thing in the way of Surgery, but all depend on me for ſupplies.</p>
                        <p>I have ſketched out, what in my opinion, every Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment ought to be ſupplied with, in the way of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:015447_0058_0F9982A3DB6CE3A8"/>
By comparing this ſketch, with the returns made for fifteen Regiments, the great want of every thing eſſential to them, as Surgeons, will be evident.</p>
                        <p>To make amends for their defect, I am well off in the Gen. Hoſpital, except in a few particulars. I have provided 10,000 bandages, have ſome hundred old ſheets, and a ſtock of medicines (tho' unaſſorted;) I have of capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal inſtruments nearly enough for Hoſpital uſe. But, in the mean time, what is to become of the Regimental Surgeons? Should I divide my ſtores amongſt them, they would be diſſipated, and ourſelves left deſtitute. To obſerve a medium. I have ordered to be iſſued from the General Hoſpital ſtores, 60 bandages, 2 ſheets, 4 tourniquets, a quantity of lint and tow, and a cheſt of medicines, out of what I have collected with the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Hoſpital Surgeons and Mates, who bare no proportion, in number, to the Regimental Surgeons and Mates, (there being, perhaps, 40 Regiments here,) reſerving the reſt to ſupply that particular part of the army which may ſtand in moſt need: But of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I have none to ſpare, and I begin to want ſome capital medicines.—Moreover, ſymptoms of a putrid fever begin to appear.</p>
                        <p>In this ſituation, I have called many of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Surgeons together; have had a conference with them; deſired a deputation from each Brigade; have given them a plan of regulations for Regimental Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals, and a form of a memorial, or repreſentation to Congreſs They all look to me, for ſupplies of every thing they want: I have no authority for that purpoſe. It is contrary to my judgment to ſupply them with all they want. To prove this, I refer you to all who know any thing of the matter. I refer you to Dr. Baſs, in Philadelphia, who knows theſe matters as well as any man: I refer you to a copy of a letter, on this ſubject, from a man of experience, which I encloſe<note n="*" place="bottom">See the next letter.</note>. I muſt not, I durſt not tranſgreſs orders, or exceed my
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:015447_0059_0F9982A4F7E76AA8"/>
line of duty more than diſobey, or go contrary to them. It is the ſame thing. I call for orders. I ſhall ſhrink from no fatigue: Say what is my duty, and to the beſt of my power, I will obey: But leave me not without orders Every General, every Colonel of a Regiment, every ſurgeon in the army think I have full power, and ample inſtructions, and know not where to apply for the relief of their men, if ſick or wounded, and needing uncommon ſupplies, if I cannot afford them. It is a cruel ſituation. My errand to Philadelphia was to repreſent theſe things; to ſettle the channels of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; to obtain ſufficient means, or authority ſufficient to procure them. I am bound to a ſpot: Scarcely could I obtain permiſſion to leave this place, for a few days, to come to Philadelphia, and lay theſe matters before you.</p>
                        <p>Again, I am preſſed on the ſide of Canada. I have wrote preſſingly on this ſubject. I have ſent you a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from Dr. Potts. He ſays, there are 3000 ſick, coming to Albany. I have not received the leaſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, or inſtruction from Congreſs; nor can I give any aſſiſtance to that part of the army, without orders or power. Let them give me orders, whether limited or ample, they ſhall be obeyed. I will anſwer for my conduct. But do not make me nominal Gen. Direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, and leave me, at the ſame time, a deſtitute, a help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs one. I have requeſted my proportion of the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines in the hands of Meſſieurs Delaney and Smith, to be kept ſar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

though late, almoſt too late, yet that it is not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo, either to receive power, inſtructions, or means to regulate the affairs of my department.

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>LAST week, I received yours, of the 1ſt inſt. The Regimental Surgeons were never allowed medicines from the Hoſpital, unleſs their own happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be expended, from being long encamped in a part of the country, where none could poſſibly be got: And to prevent their being out of medicines, as much as poſſible, previous to their taking the field, their medicine cheſts were always examined, by order of the Commander in Chief, by the officers of the Hoſpital; to ſee they were provided with their proper ſtores for the ſervice they were going upon, and a report was made to the Commander in Chief, accordingly.</p>
                  <p>When it was found proper to deliver them medicines, they were no more than might ſerve them till they went into quarters, or could be ſupplied from any neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place. AS TO ANY OTHER STORES, I never knew them once thought of, or demanded.</p>
                  <p>Every Regiment had an Hoſpital to itſelf, for ſlight caſes, which the Surgeon and his Mates took care of; the charges of which were always defrayed by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment.</p>
                  <p>The medicinal and chirurgical ſtores for the Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal were, for every campaign, fixed and ordered, the preceeding winter, by the Phyſicians, Apothecaries and Surgeons, in a joint conſultation.</p>
                  <p>To give you our long liſts of medicines, &amp;c. ("<hi>on any expedition laſt war, as you requeſt,</hi>") would avail you little at preſent, as many of the articles are not to
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:015447_0060_0F9982A6A6765810"/>
be had; nay, I am certain, one half of them might, at any time, be left out: When you come to town, you ſhall ſee them; They are too long for a letter.</p>
                  <p>We always made our own bandages, ſplints, tourni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets, &amp;c. from old linnen, leather, &amp;c. we ſent out on purpoſe. We had never leſs than five hundred old ſheets, and two or three hundred ſkins came out at once, which the Hoſpital Mates made into the different kinds of bandages, &amp;c. in common uſe.</p>
                  <p>General Gates can inform you, that the eſtimates I gave in for the Hoſpital, including the pay of the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, were ten thouſand pounds for the firſt ſix months, for ten thouſand men, and in the ſame proportion for a larger number.</p>

            <p>IN the ſame packet, with the foregoing letter to the Medical Committee of Congreſs, page 67; I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed a variety of papers for their conſideration, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, copies of the inſtructions given to the Regimental Surgeons July the third, page 54; of their intended memorial to Congreſs, page 62; of the regulations propoſed and agreed upon with them, for the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Regimental Hoſpitals, page 64; of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding letter, from a gentleman at Philadelphia, very converſant in the ſubject, to ſhew what were the uſages and cuſtoms of the General Hoſpital, in the Britiſh ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and particularly to declare what kind of ſtores, and under what circumſtances, the Regimental Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons were allowed to draw from the General Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in that ſervice, page 72; and of the foregoing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of inſtruments and bandages neceſſary for every Regiment, page 73; together with copies of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent diet tables, and other regulations of the General Hoſpital. Theſe were ſeverally indorſed and numbered, being calculated for the purpoſe, and intended to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the promiſe I had made his EXCELLENCY GE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NERAL WASHINGTON, in the beginning of my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to him, of March, page 32; by explaining the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, both of the General and Regimental Hoſpitals;
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:015447_0061_0F9982A6AE98F098"/>
pointing out the uſes and proper government of each; their ſeparate and diſtinct deſigns; the means of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the Regimental, and rendering them more uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, by placing them in a due ſubordination to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, Hoſpitals. I did not doubt the works being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, both to the General and the Congreſs, as it might be ſuppoſed, they were not much verſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in theſe matters; with which, however, it was neceſſary for the good of the ſervice, they ſhould be acquainted.</p>
            <p>To underſtand the better what were the uſes of the copies of the different diet tables, and of other regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the General Hoſpital, which accompanied my letter to the Medical Committee of Congreſs; and to demonſtrate, at the ſame time, what pains I was at, to introduce method and exactneſs into every branch of the department entruſted to my care, as I have omitted to mention the particulars before, it will be very proper to take notice, in this place, of the ſteps I had taken for that purpoſe, when at Cambridge.</p>
            <p>So ſoon after my arrival in the army as to have been able to take a review of the ſtate, in which the General Hoſpital then was, I appointed a meeting of the Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Surgeons to take under conſideration the proper ſteps to be purſued for the better government of the Hoſpital. I, therefore, in the firſt place, ſhewed them my commiſſion, with the inſtructions from Congreſs for the eſtabliſhment of the General Hoſpital; I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to them my idea, of the duties of the ſeveral officers, and gave them a form of the various returns which I expected <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> laid before them the different diet tables that were in uſe, in the General Hoſpital of the Britiſh army, laſt war, as well as thoſe in the different Hoſpitals of London and Weſtminſter, with all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations obſerved, in each diſtinct part and office, for the government of St. Thomas's Hoſpital, which I had procured at the time I was pupil there, under the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated

Phyſicians, Milner, Akenſide and Ruſſell, and brought with me to the army.</p>
            <p>With theſe regulations before us, compared with the nature and diſeaſes of the climate, and thoſe incident to an army, with the proviſions of the country, and manner of living, as well as the nature of our eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſeveral ſets of rules were drawn up for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter regulating of our own Hoſpitals, and particularly for aſcertaining, and enforcing the duties of the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, the Mates, the Apothecaries, the Stewa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>s, the Matron and Nurſes, the Waiters and Attendants; and alſo rules for the obſervance of the Patients. It would protract this piece, to too great a length, were I to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert them here: I therefore content myſelf, with taking notice, that the perfecting them was a work of time and of mature reflexion, which would do no diſcredit to any of the gentlemen that were concerned in the performance, were I to publiſh them at large. And I muſt, to do juſtice to this taſk enjoined them, which was ſubmitted to my own corrections, obſerve, that it was the means of introducing that exactitude in duty, and that better oeconomy and diſcipline into the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Hoſpital, that were wanted, as might be naturally expected; by means of which, all the proper buſineſs of the Hoſpital was afterwards conducted with more regularity, eaſe and ſatisfaction to the officers, and greater benefit and advantages to the patients; all which were much wanted, in all the tranſactions I have ever had with the Regimental Surgeons.</p>
            <p>This I thought a proper employment for a Director General, and deſerving the attention of the Congreſs and Commander in Chief. I therefore diſpatched them to the General, by return of one of his ſervants, ſent to engage me to come to Head-Quarters, for his peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal at firſt, and then to be forwarded to Congreſs; hoping he would be pleaſed to ſecond my letter to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, with ſome repreſentation from himſelf, of the neceſſity of adopting theſe, or ſome other regulationſ
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:015447_0062_0F9982A77106CFD0"/>
to anſwer the intention, for which theſe papers might ſerve as a proper foundation on which to proceed. They were accompanied with a note to Colonel Reed the Adjutant-General, in which I wrote as follows:</p>

                  <p>I imagine the annexed regulations, &amp;c. for the eſtabliſhment, management and ſupplies of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Hoſpitals, will be of great uſe in the army, and tend to remove the frequent complaints of Regimental Surgeons, reſpecting the want of ſome better provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the ſick under their care, and enable them to diſcharge their duty with more CHEARFULNESS, and ADVANTAGE to the ſervice.</p>
                  <p>They are ſubmitted with the Memorial &amp;c. to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, to General Waſhington's peruſal, if he has time to conſider them, for his approbation. It will appear on reading them, that thoſe, or ſome ſuch regulations, are much wanted, and cannot take place, unleſs they have his ſanction in General Orders.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps you may have ſo much leiſure as to examine the ſeveral encloſed papers, and communicate the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of them to the General, if he is not ſufficiently diſengaged to look over them, himſelf. I intend, agreeeable to your deſire, to be at Head-Quarters early, to come at two o'clock, that there may be ſome time for converſing on this ſubject, before dinner."</p>

            </floatingText>
            <p>I requeſted, that after the General had ſatisfied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in reſpect to the contents of theſe papers, they might be forwarded with his diſpatches to Congreſs.</p>
            <p>WHEN next I had an opportunity of ſpeaking with the General and ſuppoſed he might have acquainted himſelf with the purport and deſign of thoſe papers, I took the liberty of aſking his opinion of them. He had been greatly hurried, as I could perceive by the number of applicants to himſelf, on a variety of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:015447_0063_0F9982A82AD0EC18"/>
of different departments. His anſwer, therefore, was ſuch as might be expected, couched in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing interrogatory: How can you think, I have time to read over ſuch a bundle of papers? I told him I was ſenſible of his ſituation, and how precious his time was; that the reaſon of my troubling him with ſo much writing, was that he might not be interrupted by long conſultations, though on the moſt neceſſary matters; but be able to make himſelf maſter of the ſubject, when moſt at leiſure to conſider it, with the means be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him: I informed him as briefly as poſſible, of the general contents, and what I had written to the Adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant General, in whoſe abilities he placed great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and concluded with a requeſt, that if he ſhould not have leiſure ſhortly, to read them over himſelf, that he would refer them to Colonel Reed, or any other perſon he choſe, to give him an account of them, that ſome orders might iſſue in conſequence: They related to important matters, and nothing could be done in them, without his orders, on which he let me know, that I ſhould hear from him ſoon, on the buſineſs they were intended to recommend to his notice.</p>
            <p>I think it was that very day, the reſolves of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, July 17th, came to hand, and were communicated to me, of which I obtained a certified copy from the Adjutant-General, and another, about four days after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards from Colonel Robert H. Harriſon, Secretary to the General, which bears date July 26, 1776.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Regimental Surgeons, who were impatient to know the General's mind, that they might take their meaſures accordingly, for making a perſonal application to himſelf, which they judged would anſwer as well as applying to Congreſs; or for forwarding the memorial and petition to Congreſs, as might appear moſt ſuitable, on knowing his mind; were made acquainted with the beforementioned reſolves. Theſe reſolves produced a general diſguſt in the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Surgeons, as they anticipated, and might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:015447_0063_0F9982A82AD0EC18"/>
the ſucceſs of any application to Congreſs at that time; and cut them off from all preſent hopes of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying into execution, their favourite ſcheme of having Regimental Hoſpitals under their own management, furniſhed and ſupplied to their wiſhes; and from the expectation of handling public monies</p>
            <p>The chagrin and bitterneſs of ſpirit which they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted on this occaſion, is inexpreſſible; and every mean artifice that could be deviſed, was carried into execution by ſome of them, to counteract, and, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to evade thoſe reſolves. They gave proof indeed, that, for the infamy of it, deſerves to be recorded, to what degrees of weakneſs, blindneſs and folly, men deſtitute of the principles of honour and honeſty will be tranſported, by a falſe pride, and the diſappointment of ſecret and ambitions views, when they prefer the gratification of their own deſires, however unjuſt, to the intereſt of the cauſe they are engaged to promote, if oppoſed to each other. But I ſhall defer giving the particulars, till I have firſt communicated a letter, which with a view to ſerve thoſe ungratefal men all in my power, I wrote to General Waſhington, and is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:</p>

                  <p>THE Congreſs having come into a number of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves reſpecting the General Hoſpital, &amp;c I find that one of them, as it now ſtands, gives great uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Regimental Surgeons. It is that which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits them from drawing upon the Hoſpital of their department for any ſtores, except medicines and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and orders, that when any ſick perſon ſhall
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:015447_0064_0F9982A90B710420"/>
require other ſtores, they ſhall be received into the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Hoſpital, and the rations of the ſaid ſick perſons be ſtopped, ſo long as they are in the ſaid Hoſpital.</p>
                  <p>The Regimental Surgeons ſeem to think, if this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve ſhould remain as it now ſtands, without any pallia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive conſtruction in favor of ſupplying the ſick under their care, with neceſſary articles of diet, &amp;c. (for no proviſion is made by any of theſe reſolves for changing the diet of the ſick, and their rations would be very improper diet.) they have nothing left, but immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to order the whole of their ſick into the General Hoſpital. What would be the conſequence? Inſtead of about three hundred, which is the preſent number of the ſick in the General Hoſpital, it would imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately amount to two thouſand or upwards, and the numbers increaſe every day. But where we ſhall get room for them, is the difficulty; and in caſe of an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and many perſons being wounded, that difficulty would increaſe: The General Hoſpital would be crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Regimental Surgeons, who profeſs their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent deſire of being uſefully employed, would complain of having nothing to do. But what is the worſt part of it, as the dyſentery, and fevers of a putrid kind now prevail; the crowding ſo many together into the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Hoſpital, would certainly engender a malignant, peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential fever, that would threaten the ruin of the army.</p>
                  <p>Theſe difficulties, in my opinion, might for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, be got over in one of theſe two ways, the choice of which is left to your Excellency.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, is by adopting a ſet of regulations, drawn up and agreed upon, betwixt the Regimental Surgeons and myſelf, (if it met with your Excellency's approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,) and which I laid before your Excellency, a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night ago, for your conſideration.</p>
                  <p>Otherwiſe, let the Regimental Surgeons be ſuffered to keep ſuch men in their own Regimental Hoſpitals, under their own care, whoſe caſes would endanger the ſpreading of putrid and infectious diſtempers Let
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:015447_0064_0F9982A90B710420"/>
them be reported to, and born on the liſt of patients admitted into, the General Hoſpital, but remain with the Regimental Surgeons, under their care: Then their rations will be ſtopped, diſcounted with the Commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-General, and in lieu thereof, they will receive ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of ſuch articles, as the General Hoſpital can fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them with; of wine, vinegar, molaſſes, meal, &amp;c. which I believe would not far exceed the amount of thoſe rations: This would anſwer to a plan I propoſed to your Excellency laſt winter, and which was approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Your Excellency only wiſhed then, that ſome me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod might be taken to prevent the rations of the ſick being twice drawn. I apprehend that matter is fully guarded againſt, by the method pointed out by the 6th reſolve of Congreſs, of July 17, on the ſubject of the G. Hoſpital. The firſt method would give the greateſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, not only to the Regimental Surgeons, but to the officers, and to the men; and an experiment would be made of the real expence attending Regimental Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, and every cauſe, or even ſhadow of complaint, vaniſh: It would encourage the ſoldier in his duty, and if it is found, on trial, ſubject to any abuſe, I imagine that abuſe could be eaſily remedied, by future regulations, or a ſtoppage in the men's pay, at the time of a new enliſtment.</p>
                  <p>The preſent increaſe of the ſick is a ſerious matter, and requires a ſpeedy remedy. I regret the calling for your Excellency's attention (for ever ſo ſhort a time) to my department; but, I flatter myſelf, the importance of the ſubject, and the advantages which may accrue to the ſervice from it, will evince the neceſſity, and be a ſufficient apology for it.</p>

ANY man of the leaſt knowledge of the world, that reflects ever ſo little, will readily own, how diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable a piece of buſineſs it muſt be, for any gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to break in upon a Commander in Chief, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced as General WASHINGTON was, with ſo great a burden of managing an army of undiſciplined men, in which the nature and extent of the various departments were ſo unſettled, and ſo few officers knew their duty, and therefore teized with numberleſs applications, which muſt make him, at times, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably, more difficult of acceſs; and to importune him repeatedly on buſineſs, which is ſuppoſed to be already ſettled, either by his own orders, or thoſe of Congreſs, muſt be very irkſome.</p>
            <p>After reading the foregoing letter, can there be a perſon found, who will not allow that I exerted myſelf to the very utmoſt in favour of the Regiment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Surgeons, to ſerve them to the extent of my abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and after thoſe repeated exertions, and ſteady perſeverance at all times, to promote their reaſonable wiſhes, as far as was conſiſtent with my duty, even in oppoſition to the ſentiments of the General and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, when theirs did not agree with my own ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; was not the ingratitude and wickedneſs of thoſe Regimental Surgeons of the deepeſt dye; becauſe I would not ſacrifice to their importunate craving, the duty of my ſtation, and the truſt repoſed in me, as well as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of my ſuperiors; to be guilty, as they were, of private cabals and ſecret conſpiracies, (of which I have lately received full proof,) to injure my cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and miſrepreſent my conduct, with a view, if poſſible, to ruin me, for ever, in the public eſteem?</p>
            <p>THAT none may imagine I wiſhed to reduce the Regimental Surgeons to any improper dependence on myſelf, which might be aſſigned as a reaſon for their oppoſition to me, I think fit to declare, that I never
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:015447_0065_0F9982A9A597A070"/>
ſought for any authority over them, inconſiſtent with their true intereſt, or upon any occaſion, that I was not compelled to aſſume. On the contrary, I declined thoſe occaſions that frequently offered, of making them more dependent upon me, than I knew would be agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to themſelves, ever ſince they had taken exceptions to the General's public order at Cambridge, that no Regimental Surgeons ſhould receive commiſſions in the army to be raiſed, for the time to come, till they had ſubmitted to ſuch examination of their abilities, as I thought neceſſary; and had found means to evade it, by prevailing with their Colonels, who (I have been informed) had blank commiſſions by them, to fill them up with the names of the former Surgeons, without any regard to that order. Yet if I had ever made any repreſentation of this matter to the General, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, he would not have ſuffered his own orders to have been diſpenſed with, in ſo extraordinary a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. So far was he from deſiring to enlarge their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or to leſſen my authority, that he was pleaſed to propoſe it to me, himſelf, in one of the laſt confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, I had with him, on the ſubject of regulating the Regimental Surgeons, in order to make them more abſolutely dependent upon me, that they ſhould receive warrants at my hands only, for acting in that ſtation. This propoſal I declined, on purpoſe to avoid the envy that would attend ſo much power, and the conſequent miſconſtructions that, I was confident, would be paſſed on the moſt perfect and upright uſe, that any man, in my poſt, could make of it. I was deſirous to avoid giving room for jealouſies to a ſet of men, of ſuch tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent and refractory tempers, as I diſcovered ſome of them to be, and of which I experienced the ill effects in the inſtances I have already, and am further to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, of Mr. Story.</p>
            <p>He once called upon me, on buſineſs of Colonel Little's Regiment, ſoon after my arrival from Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:015447_0066_0F9982B1B5D9C058"/>
to New-York, when I had not yet laid aſide all thoughts of finiſhing the taſk began at Cambridge, on the general's order, to examine the Regimental Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, with a view to confirm thoſe who were qualified for the office, and to report ſuch as were deficient in education, or abilities. He had been previouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to me, as a mere firebrand; and as one that was not thought to be properly qualified for a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon's place; whether juſtly, or not, I ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to ſay, as I never proceeded to any examination of his abilities. I aſked him whether he acted as Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon to that Regiment: He told me that he did. On reminding him of the General's order, for examining the Regimental Surgeons, he behaved in a very inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and impertinent manner, giving me to know, "that he had his commiſſion already, no thanks to me, which was as valid, and of as good authority as my own, and that, truly, he never would ſubmit to any examination of mine."</p>
            <p>Had I been diſpoſed to treat him, as he merited on that occaſion, I imagine he would have found that I could eaſily have obliged him to it, or to quit the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: But peace was my object. This made me paſs over his preſent rudeneſs of behaviour; and encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in thoſe ſubſequent acts of inſolence, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable conduct which, I believe, took their riſe from the above cauſe; and if he was not always at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, yet he always ſhewed himſelf to be one of the moſt violent agitators, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If I may be allowed to mention, in this place, what I take to be the true cauſes of the malevolence of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimental Surgeons againſt me; they were 1ſt, my diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing them to draw ſtores, at pleaſure, from the G.

their being found unequal to the taſk, if they were obliged to ſubmit to the inquiry; and 3dly, it was a received opinion of theirs, that the reſolve of Congreſs, "that the Hoſpital Surgeons and Mates ſhould take rank of the Regimental Surgeons and Mates," was owing to me.</p>
            <p>Theſe were unpardonable ſins, which they were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined never to forgive nor forget. From the day theſe laſt reſolutions of Congreſs were known, they left no ſcheme untryed to injure my character, and miſrepreſent my conduct Of this I have had the ſtrongeſt aſſurances from ſome gentlemen, who, ſince my diſmiſſion, and not before, have informed me of their having received application from thoſe men to join them in their cabals and conſpiracy againſt me; who were ſtruck with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment at the propoſal, and from the reſpect which, they were pleaſed to ſay, they entertained for my cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and conduct, endeavoured to diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wade them from their wicked purpoſes, and to convince them that I had ſhewn, in a very ſtriking manner, my inclination to ſerve them, in the memorial and propoſals I had drawn up for that purpoſe, and the letters I had written to Congreſs and the General, in their favour; but being bound to act agreeable to my orders, it was not in my power to ſwerve from them. It was the hope of having prevailed with them, by theſe remonſtrances, to lay aſide their intentions, and their ceaſing to importune them further on the ſubject, that inclined them to make no mention of this affair to me, till they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards learned they had, though ſecretly, put their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns into execution, with a ſucceſs that amazed them.</p>
            <p>The acts they purſued to fruſtrate the intentions of Congreſs, and to force me to a compliance with their meaſures; were firſt, a neglect of reporting the ſick for admiſſion into the General-Hoſpital; the next was their leaving their proper poſts with their reſpective Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and carrying the ſick to a diſtance from the army, where they ſuffered much, and aſcribed all the ill effects of their miſconduct, to my not receding from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:015447_0067_0F9982B3B9D04718"/>
of Congreſs: And again, their infuſing jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies and groundleſs ſuſpicions into ſuch officers as they could influence by their repreſentations, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting, by that means, to miſlead the General Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Members of Congreſs, to my prejudice. Whatever miſchances happened to the ſick from their own perverſeneſs, or ignorance, were laid by them at my door, as one ſo wedded to his own plan, as not to yield to the united voice of all the Regimental Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, to come into their meaſures. And, true it is, my perſeverance in what I conceived to be my duty, and for the good of the ſervice, was unſhaken; nor could any conſideration induce me to deviate from the commands of my ſuperiors; although, had the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs ſeen fit to alter their reſolves, in ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, I ſhould have thought it would have been for the better, as my letters fully prove.</p>
            <p>I am now led, in the order of events, to lay before the public, ſome ſpecimens of the wickedneſs of that ſet of men, in counterfeiting, caballing, and endeavouring to make impreſſions upon General Officers and others, in their favour, and to my prejudice.</p>
            <p>And firſt, as to their actor counterfeiting, and paſſing what they had counterfeited as a reſolve of Congreſs.</p>
            <p>Having already mentioned the chagrin and bitterneſs of ſpirit, which many of them diſcovered, on knowing the reſolves of Congreſs, July 17; which cut off all their immediate hopes to effect their favorite ſcheme of having Regimental Hoſpitals allowed them, on ſuch a footing, as to enable them to accumulate ſtores at pleaſure, and to give them ſome diſpoſal or public mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; it is to be remarked, that what compleated their chagrin was, the determination of Congreſs, which had before raiſed the pay of themſelves and Mates, to increaſe that of the Hoſpital Surgeons and Mates, which was always more than theirs, in ſuch proportion as they thought proper; but what above all things kindled their malice and reſentment was, that the Congreſs, in
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:015447_0067_0F9982B3B9D04718"/>
the ſame vote, had alſo reſolved, that the Hoſpital Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons and Mates ſhould take rank of Regimental Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons and Mates, as beforementioned, ſee page 29.</p>
            <p>Let it be remembered, then, to the perpetual infamy of the mean ſcandalous ſet who were guilty of it, that upon my furniſhing them with a copy of thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves, for the information of all the Surgeons in the army, they made an alteration in the copy of the eighth reſolve, by leaving out the particle <hi>of,</hi> and ſubſtituting the word <hi>with</hi> in its place, which made an entire change of the meaning of that reſolve, into another of an oppoſite ſignification, thus foiſting in a brat of their own begetting, to uſurp the authority of a vote of Congreſs, they diſcovered what their ſecret machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations tended to continually, as if this ſilly device could ſerve the purpoſe of their wiſhes, to lower the eſtimation of the General-Hoſpital, and raiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into imaginary conſequence.</p>
            <p>After paſſing this counterfeit reſolve, and circulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it briſkly, two of their champions, the famous Doctor Story, and an aſſociate of his, with a view to inſult the gentlemen of the Hoſpital, went about, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulting in imaginary triumph, to vent their reproachful language againſt them, and thereby had nearly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed what they were intent upon; which was, to make their ſituation ſo diſagreeable, notwithſtanding they never interfered with them, as to induce them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to quit a ſtation that was rendered ſo irkſome by them, rather than be ſubject to ſuch inſolence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. One of thoſe gentlemen was Doctor Warren, (brother to the deceaſed General Warren,) a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who was ſo happy, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> gain the eſteem of all who knew him, by his underſtanding his humanity, his affable and polite behaviour, and his great aſſiduity and attention to diſcharge the duties of his ſtation: He was at that time acting in the place of a Director of the Military Hoſpitals at Long-Iſland, (where, among others, Colonel Little's Regiment was poſted,) with the
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:015447_0068_0F9982B42876C7A8"/>
title and pay only of Surgeon in the General Hoſpital, in which he had given great ſatisfaction to General Green, and every officer of rank at Long-Iſland, who always ſpoke of him, to me, in high terms of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. On which, it may not be amiſs, tranſiently, to conſider this, as a full proof how ſalutary thoſe orders were, which I had given, for providing for the relief and comfortable accommodations of the ſick at Long-Iſland, as well as the efficacy with which they were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into execution, by the wiſdom and prudence of the officer who managed the Hoſpital department there, by my inſtructions.</p>
            <p>Diſappointed in their malicious deſigns, in the firſt, they deſiſted not from other, attempts, to perplex the officers of the General Hoſpital; and till their aims were accompliſhed, a party of them determined to leave nothing undone, which they could have hopes of effecting, to produce a prevailing uneaſineſs and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content in the General Hoſpital.</p>
            <p>In conſequence of my letter to General Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, of July 25th, in favour of the Regimental Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, the Adjutant-General called upon me, by his Excellency's command, to conſider how far theirs and my requeſt could be granted, conſiſtently with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of Congreſs, without ſetting aſide their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves. On which, ſuch General Orders were iſſued out July 28, as I thought would afford them ſome ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, if the good of the ſervice was what they had in view, and not their own private advantage and emolument. But I was greatly miſtaken in this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: They were allowed Regimental Hoſpitals under certain reſtrictions; amongſt which one was, a power given me to ſend Hoſpital Surgeons to viſit their Hoſpitals, to prevent crowding them, and keeping more ſick on hand, than they could take good care of, who were to be judges what patients were proper objects for, and directed to receive them into the General Hoſpital.</p>
            <p>They clamoured exceedingly, drew up an appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:015447_0068_0F9982B42876C7A8"/>
to the General on that head, which was laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Council of General Officers; and ſome farther points given up to them, by a General order of Auguſt the third. The inſolence of a party of the Regiment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Surgeons roſe, in proportion, as they were gratified in any conceſſions made to them, by the officers of the Hoſpital, for the ſake of peace; who never viſited their ſick, on that account, but ſubmitted to receive them, as they ſaw fit to report, and ſend them to the General Hoſpital, rather than give room for ſuppoſing they had any contention with the Regimental Surgeons: In truth they had not; unleſs the fire which was kept up, on one ſide only, by a factious part of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Surgeons, could be called a contention, and to the keeping up of which, the Hoſpital Surgeons only contributed by their patience, and ſuffering for a while, for the good of the ſervice, thoſe men to ſport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, without interruption, in their unreaſonable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, or by oppoſing them only, with gentle remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances. If this is contention, it is of that ſort of which Juvenal, in his ſatyr, gives a lively deſcription. "<hi>ubi tu <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>At length, the ſenſe of what was due to themſelves wrought ſo far upon the two eldeſt of the Hoſpital Surgeons, Dr. Foſter and Dr. Warren, who princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally experienced the inſolence of thoſe men; that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unwilling to endure it further, and equally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to be concerned in any diſputes with them, they choſe rather to quit their preſent ſtations: The former let me know his intention to leave the ſervice; and the latter, in a genteel, manly and ſenſible letter, made known to me his ſituation, and the reſolutions into which this conduct of theirs, had forced him: He repreſented to me, what he had experienced from the rude and ungovernable temper of this ſet of men; that, not content with the determination of Congreſs and the General orders reſpecting them, they
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:015447_0069_0F9982B4E4C91D40"/>
were ever reſtleſs, and ever making new and unautho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized demands, inconſiſtent with the peace and good government of the General Hoſpital; that they were ſeeking continual occaſions for diſpute and differences; and as they found the gentlemen of the Hoſpital did not chuſe, on every occaſion, which they knew how to call forth for matter of diſputation, to trouble either me or themſelves with frequent references of their diſputes, they would gradually gain one point after another, till all their ends were, at laſt anſwered, in the ſubverſion and ruin of the General Hoſpital. In this ſituation, as there were daily expectations of the enemys landing at Long-Iſland he flattered himſelf, he could be more uſeful in the military, than in the hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal department, thus circumſtanced; and requeſted my permiſſion, that he might reſign his place in the General Hoſpital, and be allowed to act as a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer, upon the approaching action.</p>
            <p>To have been deprived of the aſſiſtance of thoſe gentlemen, at ſo critical a time, whoſe places I could not have ſupplied, with others of equal experience in the conducting of Military Hoſpitals, on the plan of the Congreſs, would have thrown the department into that confuſion, which a deſigning party were buſy to excite, in hopes, by fiſhing in troubled waters, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive thoſe advantages to themſelves, in the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment whereof, their wiſhes ſeemed to center. By explaining to the gentlemen of the Hoſpital, the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take into which this perverſe conduct of the party had led them, and by ſupporting their authority, in a proper manner, on every occaſion, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to continue in their ſtations.</p>
            <p>The next meaſures thoſe men choſe to take, as I have ſince learned, from information that I can depend upon, was to intereſt ſuch officers, over whom they had, or could acquire any influence, to make repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations in their behalf, to Members of Congreſs,
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:015447_0069_0F9982B4E4C91D40"/>
and to the General. I have cauſe to believe this was often done to the former, without my having the leaſt intelligence of their proceedings: Of courſe, I had it not in my power to explain matters, that ought to be known, or to obviate objections, however ill ſounded. I muſt, in juſtice to the General, acknowledge, I have no ſuſpicion that his Excellency ever ſuffered me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main long ignorant of any repreſentations, that were made to impeach my conduct by which I was, in all the inſtances I knew, enabled to anſwer in my juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to him, and I hope ſatisfactorily. But I cannot ſay ſo of the Congreſs; for, ſo far from giving me any information of any ſuch tranſaction, the Members of whom I have made enquiry, carefully evaded it: Of which I ſhall have occaſion to make more particular mention, in its proper place.</p>
            <p>The repreſentations, in favour of Regimental Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, which were calculated to injure me; beſides dwelling on the diſſatisfaction which the Regimental Surgeons had infuſed into many of their men, on groundleſs pretences, and which made ſome, who knew nothing of the General Hoſpital themſelves, expreſs their diſlike againſt being ſent to it; commonly ſet forth, that it would be highly prejudicial to the ſervice, when a new army was to be raiſed;—that the ſick could not be comfortably accommodated in Regimental Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals. The fact is, many of the officers had been choſen, as it were, by the men, who had not a regard to, or any conſideration of merit, in that choice, or any love of diſcipline, but were attached to the perſons of the officers they choſe, in proportion to the knowledge they had of their being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en of the ſame mean, ſordid, grovelling diſpoſition, with many of themſelves; void of the ſentiments of brave ſoldiers, love of honour and of liberty on principle, but ready to aſſociate with them on a footing of equality; who would drink drams with them, allow them to plunder, or exempt them from duty, when they did not feel themſelves, "<hi>bold to fight,</hi>"
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:015447_0070_0F9982B602053258"/>
and who had no objection to fill the army with malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerers, public extortioners and cowards.</p>
            <p>Here a ſhocking group of diſagreeable facts preſent to my remembrance in reflecting upon the expedients that have been made uſe of to raiſe troops, and the ſhameful conſequences. It is a fact, I believe too ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally known to be diſputed, that in order to engage men to enter more readily into the ſervice, officers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions were allowed to men, whoſe ranks were to be determined by the number of levies they could raiſe. Prudence, courage, conduct, education experience, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, or fitneſs to command, were not the requiſites for officers. No wonder, then, that ſuch kind of men were choſen officers, as many of them were; men of the meaneſt figure and capacity, ſuch as they termed civil fellows, but in ſtrictneſs of meaning. Major Sturgeons, or errant Jerry Sneaks with noſes of wax, ſo very pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant as to be governed by the privates, and many of thoſe, if we may judge of cauſes by effects, had little in view by entering the ſervice but to make money, by faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening themſelves, as leeches, on every thing, from which they could draw pelf. And therefore it was no unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual thing, as I have been often told, when a company was forming for the men to chuſe thoſe, from amongſt themſelves, for officers, who conſented to throw their pay into joint ſtock with the privates, from which, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned and non-commiſſioned officers; Captains, Lieutenants, Enſigns, S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and privates, drew equal ſhares. Some of thoſe, who conſented to be privates for one ſix weeks, three months, or ſix months, as it happened, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have their turn to command, on a new enliſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and perhaps to command thoſe very men who were now their officers.</p>
            <p>What was to be expected from ſuch men and officers, under no diſcipline but to run away, by whole compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, at the appearance of a handful of the enemy. Will any man deny this to be a fact? I will appeal to
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:015447_0070_0F9982B602053258"/>
one inſtance, out of many. At the approach of an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced party of the Britiſh troops, after the landing at York Iſland, about three hundred of the men, who were advantageouſly ſtationed for oppoſing them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, without giving fire, with great precipitation; or, in common language, ran-away: They were met by Glover's Regiment, which ſtopped their flight: As was no unuſual thing, on being charged with cowardice, the common men caſt the reproach from themſelves on their officers, declaring it to be their faults, who, inſtead of putting themſelves at the head of the men, and leading them on to the attack, or there ſuſtaining the charge like ſoldiers, were the firſt to ſcamper off, leaving their company, to fly to ſuch places of ſafety as they could. The officers of Colonel Glover's regiment, one of the beſt corps's in the ſervice, and who were indeed gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, immediately obliged the fugitive officers and ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, equally, to turn into the ranks with the ſoldiers of Glover's regiment, and obliged the trembling wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, to march back to the ground they had quitted. I have been an eye-witneſs, myſelf, to whole battalions running off from Powle's-Hook, and the heights of Bergen, upon the firing of a broad ſide from a man of war, in her ſailing down the North River to join the fleet below, when obliged to remove from her ſtation, to avoid a fire-ſhip, although not a man was hurt by that fire. Theſe doughty champions never ſtopped till they came to Second River, but forced away the very waggons that were impreſſed to tranſport the ſick, and thoſe wounded at Long-Iſland, to Newark; to carry off themſelves and baggage, for many of them choſe to ride, to ſave their legs, in caſe of being more nearly purſued. A cannon being planted in the cauſeway, that commanded the ferry at Second River, was point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards them, by an officer of artillery, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded there; and who threatened to mow them down, if they did not return to their poſts. What was their next ſhift? They betook themſelves to a ferry a mile
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:015447_0071_0F9982BAAB81EC98"/>
above: The boats happened to be on the other ſide, but within reach of their ſhot; on which, being fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of any delay, they called out to the ferrymen to haſten over with their boats, or they would diſcharge a volley upon them; and thus, they made good their retreat!</p>
            <p>When ſuch were the officers, is it to be wondered at, or rather is it to be believed? But how incredible ſoever it may appear to thoſe at a diſtance, it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputable truth, that a Captain was tried and broke, by a Court-Martial, for ſtealing his ſoldiers blankets, the minutes of which Court-Martial are not only publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt ourſelves, but reprinted in the New-York or Newport papers; and one officer, in the face of the General's family, and many officers of diſtinction, was found ſhaving his men, acting in ſo menial a capacity, long after the retreats from Long-Iſland and New-York, whether for the pence he could collect, or that he might ſtand a chance of intereſt and preferment, and "<hi>that he might not be prejudicial to the ſervice, when a new army was to be raiſed,</hi>" let caſuiſts determine. Whether giving ear to the unreaſonable clamours of ſuch men as theſe, and the gratifying them, by indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences in their ſenſeleſs demands, diſmiſſing an officer of diſtinguiſhed rank and truſt, for non-compliance with them, againſt the expreſs commands of Congreſs, was the moſt likely means of promoting the ſervice, or procuring reſpect and veneration for the Congreſs it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, time will manifeſt, <hi>credat Judaeus, non ego.</hi>

            <p>What inſtances of thieving, plundering and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, both in officers and men, have come to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that would diſgrace the lawleſs Arab, the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Scythian, the rude Goth, or wild and ſavage Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar; who ſpare their own, when they war on their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies!</p>

I was preſent when a lady from Weſt-Cheſter, lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a complaint with a General Officer, againſt a Captain of the regiment of artificers, who had got into her houſe, and under pretence of protecting her, as a friend, from the incurſions of the enemy, robbed her of a trunk, containing many coſtly articles; ſilks and other wearing apparel, to the amount of fourteen hundred pounds; and diſpoſed of her cloaths at a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſale, which being proved upon him, he was juſtly caſhiered.</p>
            <p>From my own knowledge, and indeed my particular loſs, having been a great ſufferer, I can declare that what the enemy have ſpared to our own people, leſs compaſſionate men, from amongſt ourſelves, have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off and deſtroyed; and Heſſian cruelty to an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, has been exceeded by the more ſavage cruelty of the very men, paid by us, to defend our property. An injured man has a right to complain; and truth will force conviction on the minds of fellow-men, however harſh and ungrateful it may be, to ſome, to hear the truth.</p>
            <p>But that I may not paſs beyond the limits of my own department, and what has a connexion with it, I will confine myſelf in the inſtances I ſhall now exhibit of diſorderly conduct, to thoſe facts, of which I came to the knowledge, in the diſcharge of my duty, and the oppoſition I met with in the diſcharge thereof. I paſs over other examples of oppreſſing helpleſs women, and families of the beſt fortune and diſtinction, on whom ſick and well, indiſcriminately, have been forced, or men that ought to have been reported to the General Hoſpital, for my directions; in which no regard has been had, whether the perſons were well diſpoſed, or otherwiſe affected, to the cauſe of American Freedom; but "<hi>tros rutiluſve ſuit, nullum diſcrimen habetur,</hi>" The object was to get poſſeſſion of their houſes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, under the pretext of accommodating the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery, and particularly for Regimental Hoſpitals. I
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:015447_0072_0F9982BBF75D7E10"/>
ſhall ſelect one caſe, in which were complicated, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard to Congreſs, diſreſpect and breach of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral's orders, oppoſition to the General Hoſpital, which ſuſtained great injury from ſuch proceedings, and great inhumanity to the fair and weak part of the creation. The circumſtances of which are well known to ſome, who are officers of rank in the army, and of irreproachable honour, to whom, if neceſſary, I can appeal, in ſupport of what I advance.</p>
            <p>About the month of Auguſt, 1776, having made frequent repreſentations at Head-Quarters, that I could not obtain regular reports from the Regimental Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, of the ſtate of their ſick; but that they were ſeizing on thoſe very houſes for regimental ſick, that were aſſigned to me, by the State of New-York, for the uſe of the General Hoſpital; an order was iſſued, requiring the Regimental Surgeons to deliver in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports I had demanded, &amp;c. and to inforce it, all Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, and Commanders of Regiments were called upon, to make it known to their Surgeons, that they might not plead ignorance, and were directed to ſee that the order was duly obſerved.</p>
            <p>Juſt at that time, a Brigade newly arrived from the Maſſachuſetts-Bay Government, under command of General Fellows, was ordered to be ſtationed along the river, from Greenwich to Chelſea and upwards, to throw up lines, and defend the ſame againſt any attempts of the enemy to land there. Moſt of the houſes fit for the accommodation of the officers of that Brigade, and for quartering of the men, being previouſly ſeized up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Regimental Surgeons, for themſelves and their ſick; Colonel Moylan, then Quarter-maſter General, deſired we might ride out together, to take a view of the ſick, and of the houſes in that quarter. He order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a large dwelling houſe, on the eſtate of the deceaſed Admiral Warren, then in poſſeſſion of certain Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental ſick, to be evacuated, and cleanſed for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation of the officers of the Brigade, poſted in
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:015447_0072_0F9982BBF75D7E10"/>
the neighbourhood, to whom therefore it was very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, as it adjoined the works thrown up for defence of the landing, but a very improper place to contain ſick perſons, as it was cloſe to the bank of the river, and particularly expoſed to the firing of the ſhips, that might paſs up or down the ſame.</p>
            <p>The very mention of diſpoſſeſſing the Regimental Surgeons of their Hoſpital, gave great diſſatisfaction, though I undertook to receive their ſick into the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Hoſpital. That propoſal met with oppoſition. That the Surgeon might have a place for the accommodation of his patients, I informed him of a large commodious barn of Mr. Campbell's at Greenwich, with two ſpare rooms on the back part, and lower floor of the houſe, at a ſmall diſtance, adjoining the kitchen, being rooms the beſt ſheltered from the ſhot of paſſing men of war, and moſt retired from the river. Such ſpacious, airey barns as the above, well floored, and ſecure from rain, yet cool, and pervious to the wind, anſwer to the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, recommended by Sir John Pringle phyſician to the Britiſh army, in a former war, as proper for hoſpitals. Such, aſſuredly, are better calculated for the recovery of dyſenteric and putrid diſeaſes, that prevailed at this time, to any of the dwelling houſes, with plaiſtered walls, and ſmall or confined chambers, which, though convenient for a private family, are not proper for the crowding of ſick into them. But fine houſes were commonly preferred by the Regimental Surgeons; and this gentleman let me know, that he ſhould expect to be broke, if he conſented to accept of a barn, however commodious, for the reception of his ſick.</p>
            <p>The houſe itſelf, he could not have, it being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>occupied by another Surgeon, for the uſe of a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Hoſpital. On looking into the rooms, they were found to be filled with the ſick, and the Surgeon who had the care, panting for breath, in the midſt of them, It was amidſt the ſultry heats of ſummer: In vain I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to him the danger of engendring a putrid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
               <pb n="98" facs="unknown:015447_0073_0F9982BD97D22CD0"/>
fever, from crowding ſo many ſick, in confined rooms, in that hot ſeaſon. He had near a hundred ſick in the houſe: I forbad him then, as I had uniformly prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited every Regimental Surgeon I converſed with on the ſubject, from taking charge of more than thirty or forty ſick, on the outſide, at any one time, being a larger number than they could well attend; as I deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to know how they intended to manage, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> called to the field of battle, or on any ſudden removal of their regiments, an event daily expected, and they encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered with ſo many ſick. As the other Surgeon had refuſed to occupy the barn, and ſhady rooms on the ground floor, back of the houſe, I recommended it to him, to ſend at leaſt one half of his ſick to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Hoſpital, and remove the greater part of the men into the barn: He diſregarded my advice, a putrid fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prevailed, he caught the infection, and paid the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of his raſhneſs, with his life.</p>
            <p>I then went to General Heath, who commanded that diviſion of the army, and repreſented the matter to him; and as it was but a ſmall diſtance from his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, requeſted him to give himſelf the trouble, of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his own eyes, and judging himſelf of the truth of the facts I related. The General, in polite terms, declined my moſt importunate ſolicitation, upon this unanſwerable objection, that it might look, as if he made himſelf a party againſt the Regimental Surgeons.</p>
            <p>As the Surgeon had never made his report, and the order had been iſſued a week, I had waited on the Lieutenant-Colonel of the regiment, in perſon, before I ſaw the Surgeon and complained of his neglect, in not reporting his ſick, and in not ſending ſuch as exceeded the number he could take care of, to the General Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital. I reminded him that, by the General Order, he was required to ſee that the Surgeon complyed with ſaid order. The anſwer he gave me, was in theſe very words: "That the Regimental Surgeons could read the orders for themſelves; and it not, he ſhould give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:015447_0073_0F9982BD97D22CD0"/>
no trouble about it; adding, that, if it was in his power to prevent it, none of his men ſhould ever be carried to a General Hoſpital."</p>
            <p>Perhaps it may be imagined from ſuch a reply, he had reaſon to aſſert, that the General Hoſpital was not kept in a clean and proper ſtate, and that the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Hoſpitals were: The reverſe of which was true: The former were always kept clean and airey and, in the words of General Green's letter, which I ſhall have occaſion to publiſh at large, "<hi>well provided with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, and the ſick very comfortable;</hi>" whereas moſt of the Regimental Hoſpitals, I had ever ſeen, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the filth and naſtineſs of them, deſerved the appellation they have acquired in the Eaſtern Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of peſt-houſes; for ſuch they commonly turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out to be. I aſked him his reaſons: He made no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to my queſtion; but required of me to give him an order, which it ſeems he thought proper to demand of me, in favour of his Surgeon, for a number of bed frames.</p>
            <p>This leads me to ſhew in what manner the Regiment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Surgeons and ſuch officers were ever at work, by their plans, and method of proceeding, to exhauſt, unfurniſh, or prevent the ſupplies of the General Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, all in their power I had engaged the Quarter-maſter General, to give orders in his department, for making a large number of bed frames, for the ſick of the General Hoſpital. So faſt as forty or fifty were made, the Regimental Surgeons, with, or without or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from their officers, applyed for, and carried them away. Colonel Moylan, told the Officer in my hearing, "that they had carried off above two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, that were intended for the General Hoſpital; which of courſe, could not be provided with them as faſt as was wanted." Upon every movement of a regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that required a ſhifting of the houſes for Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Hoſpitals, many of the bed frames were left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, or burned, or carried off; and the Surgeons,
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:015447_0074_0F9982BDEB0DCE08"/>
probably, made freſh applications for others, whilſt the General Hoſpital could not be provided with ſpare bedſteads, for additional ſick, or wounded that might be ſent in.</p>
            <p>On that occaſion, I remonſtrated in favour of the General Hoſpital, and had a ſtop put to the further ſupplies of bed frames to the Regimental Surgeons, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">
                  <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
               </gap> was better furniſhed Upon this, and in like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, I have been viſited by ſome of the militia Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels and Brigadiers who, by their repreſentations, ſeemed to think it a hard caſe, that I would not concur with their Surgeons and them, to ſubvert the General Hoſpital, which I was appointed to eſtabliſh and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern; to enable them, contrary to the deſigns of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs the General's Orders, and the very nature of things, to transfer all the property and power of the General Hoſpital, to Regimental Surgeons. Colonel Moylan then and often, told me, that by the repeated conceſſions I was making to thoſe men, he ſhould not wonder if they ſucceeded, in what he ſaw they were aiming at, to ſubvert the General Hoſpital, and plant themſelves on the ruins, to the confuſion of all order and diſcipline.</p>
            <p>But to return from this relation, which being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with, and part of the ſubject I am upon, is not an improper digreſſion, I now reſume the narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of that particular inſtance of brutal conduct, which I have had in view, to illuſtrate my declaration of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching on my department, by an outrage upon all military order and diſcipline, and on humanity itſelf.</p>
            <p>Mr. Campbell, who had purchaſed a leaſe of the houſe aforementioned, at Greenwich, from Mr. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancey, was a ſtranger, and with his lady and family of children, of whom he had ſeveral, all young, and ſome mere infants, came into America to ſettle, about the time our unhappy diſputes, with Great Britain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, or ſoon after they began to be attended with ſuch conſequences, as civil war and bloodſhed.

being ſatisfied that he had not come over to America, with any inimical intention of taking part in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, againſt this country, ſaw fit, as I am informed, to grant him their protection; on the faith of which he determined to become an American, by ſettling here with his family: He choſe the neighbourhood of New-York, for his reſidence, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Beſet in this manner, with objects of terror, and diſguſt, which were hourly increaſing, he haſtened with his family, from their own houſe, to ſeek cover elſewhere: The moſt of the family, to my own knowledge, as I had occaſion to meet with them in one of the houſes in the neighbourhood, aſſigned to me for an hoſpital, for they applied to me for relief, very narrowly eſcaped, if they did all eſcape, periſhing, in conſequence of the putrid dyſentery, contracted as above.</p>
            <p>It is, with great averſion, at the recollection of this diſtreſſing ſcene, that I but faintly delineate it, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out throwing a veil over ſuch parts, as ſhock me, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed, as I have ever been, to hoſpitals and ſick, when I connect the ideas of delicacy in breeding and manners, and what protection is due to female dignity and helpleſs infancy, with ſuch more than ſavage treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not of enemies, but of friends and ſtrangers! <hi>Quis talia fando temperat a lachrymis!</hi>

A man that can enter into minute deſcriptions of particulars, ſo diſguſtful and diſtreſſing, may ſeem to have loſt his finer feelings; but if any man can have any gratification in wading through the dirty puddles of ſuch buſineſs, he muſt have a ſtrange perverſeneſs of taſte indeed: Are there men that would take delight in painting a Demon, in all the ſhocking picture of black deformity? Let them do it, I cannot; but being compelled in my vindication. I have touched the ſubject ſlightly. The many things that have intruded upon my memory, on this occaſion, I have endeavoured to refuſe admittance, wiſhing to bury the whole in oblivion, to riſe no more in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt us.</p>

Of the Regimental Surgeons and Mates, I will only obſerve this once, that as I have done juſtice to thoſe of them, who merited it, by declaring there were ſome amongſt them of liberal manners, education and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; I muſt be permitted to declare, there were many, very many of them, unlettered, ignorant, and rude to a degree ſcarcely to be imagined. Some of them, I have been informed, and from what I obſerved, could readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe, were never educated to the profeſſion of phyſick, nor had ever ſeen an operation of Surgery: Many of them had but ſmall appearances of either li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature or breeding, in which reſpect they fell ſhort of ſome of the privates. It would diſplay a farce of the moſt ridiculous kind, to give the public an account of the learning and attainments, which ſome of them, whom I have had an opportunity of examining, have diſcovered; or to give a tranſcript of their reports. And that this ignorance was pretty general, may be ſafely inferred from their repugnance to ſtand the teſt of inquiry, ſo contrary to the practice of thoſe, who are men of talents, improved by education, who ſhun no occaſion, of giving proof thereof, by their compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with thoſe laws and regulations, which the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of States, or the good policy of ſeminaries, and corporations of the learned in the profeſſion, deviſe, to encourage genius and merit, and to put a ſtop to the rapid growth of empyriciſm: And I obſerved, that it was generally the moſt ignorant, the moſt opiniated and the moſt diſorderly, and irregular in their conduct, who were the moſt troubleſome, and loudeſt in their cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours. Theſe were the men, from whom I found the greateſt oppoſition, to every regulation for introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing method, diſcipline and improvement, into the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment of phyſick and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>It is with much regret I have yielded to the neceſſity I have been under, in clearing up my own conduct from the imputations of a ſet of wicked men, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play the true character and behaviour of thoſe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

were my accuſers, and from the many ſamples of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine, diſorder and oppreſſion of which they have been guilty, to ſelect ſome of their nefarious practices, and of ſuch amazing prodigality, as, if it were allowed to paſs without notice, would have been ſufficient to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure deſtruction to any army, or people. I am fully perſwaded that we owe many of the misfortunes and miſcarriages of laſt campaign, to thoſe men, who were guilty of them. I have but barely ſkimmed over the ſurface of them. A reluctance to enter deeper into ſuch a ſink has reſtrained me: Were I to attempt an enumeration of them all time would fail.</p>
            <p>It is ſufficient to ſhew their deſtructive tendency, in general; to make a remark on the mean and ſordid practice, which was purſued by ſome of the Regiment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Surgeons, of ſelling certificates for furloughs and diſcharges, at a leſs ſum than a ſhilling a man. At this rate, a number equal to a regiment might be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged for a much leſs ſum, than has been ſince given, to raiſe a ſingle recruit. At a moderate computation, ſo many men have been born on ſome ſick liſts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimental Surgeons, including waiters, fit for duty, that if the practice was common, the ſtrongeſt Brigade in the army was not equal to the number thus maintained in idleneſs. I am willing to hope that thoſe inſtances of mal-practice I have adduced are ſufficient to ſhut the door againſt the like abuſes in future, and to introduce better diſcipline, and better men into ſtations of public truſt: And that men of better principle, as well as of more knowledge and humanity, are engaged in the preſent ſervice. To promote the intereſts of theſe, were the motives of my conduct, and the object I invariably purſued in all my propoſed regulations.</p>
            <p>Amongſt thoſe in employ the laſt year, ſome, in the time of need, deſerted the army altogether, and others ſhunned to attend their regiments to the field of battle.</p>
            <p>It was a general complaint, that at the battle of
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:015447_0076_0F9982C070ADD290"/>
the White-Plains, few of the Regimental Surgeons were with their reſpective Battalions, in conſequence of which many of the wounded bled to death, who, it was ſuppoſed, might have been ſaved, had they been preſent, and done their duty: Their abſence obliged me to fix myſelf at the lines, with ſome of the Hoſpital Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons. This produced the following circular letter to be ſent round the country, with orders to the Surgeons of the General Hoſpital who were at a diſtance from camp, to call upon the Regimental Surgeons, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of the reſolves of Congreſs, and the General's commands, to deliver up all their ſick to the Hoſpital, and to return to their proper poſts, ſigned, with the following declaration.</p>

            <p>I do not pretend to have knowledge of all the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations that have been made, to different Members of Congreſs, to give weight to the clamours of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Surgeons; but one of them, that I do not know of, requires my ſerious attention.</p>
            <p>Having called one day, upon General Green, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult him about ſome regulations of the hoſpitals, I found him buſy in writing a letter to the Preſident of Congreſs, complaining much of the ſufferings of the ſick, for want of ſuch eſtabliſhment, as provided pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly for taking good care of them. Not the leaſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice was taken of the unwearied pains I had beſtowed to accompliſh that purpoſe; which might lead Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs to imagine me very negligent of my duty, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attentive to matters that ſo nearly concerned me: I told him ſo: He then added a poſtſcript, in which he ſeemed barely to guard againſt reflexions upon me; yet forebore to do me that juſtice, which I thought my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf well entitled to expect from him, if to be had from any man in the army.</p>
            <p>I had attended General Green in two dangerous fits of illneſs, in which he had proofs of my attention to him, and aſſiduity to the buſineſs of my ſtation, that merited a far different return. The laſt was at a time, when General Green had the command at Long-Iſland, and about the time when the enemy were landed not many miles below. Although I was then inceſſantly engaged on New-York Iſland, I made all other buſineſs give way to my daily attendance on him; and finding his life en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered, by a putrid and billious fever, under which he laboured, prevailed with him to leave the iſland, and provided him with one of the moſt healthy, airey, ſafeſt and beſt accommodated habitations, in the center, betwixt the two rivers, two miles diſtant from the city of New-York. My place of duty changed, likewiſe,
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:015447_0078_0F9982C1B6446908"/>
and my preſence was demanded every day at Long-Iſland, to attend to the care and removal of the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Yet I viſited him, daily, once, twice or oftner, under a variety of difficulties, and watched over him with the ſtricteſt attention, and an affection little leſs than fraternal, till his recovery was ſo far compleated, that he was out of all danger. I ſhould not have giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en this account of matters, but for the following rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: The firſt is, becauſe it was at General Green's deſire, I eſtabliſhed a General Hoſpital at Long-Iſland, for the benefit of that part of the army under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, which was ſo well conducted by Doctor War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, as to compell him to paſs high encomiums on its management, in a Council of General Officers, held on the complaints made by the Regimental Surgeons, that were found to be groundleſs and unreaſonable.</p>
            <p>If there was any deficiency in either that part of the General Hoſpital itſelf, or any want in the accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the ſick of the regiments ſtationed there, that could be obtained, the fault muſt be laid at his door, and his only, becauſe he had expreſſly engaged, at my firſt conſenting, in compliance with his requeſt, to provide a General Hoſpital there; to build or fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſufficient quarters for all the ſick belonging to that diviſion of the army under his command; and becauſe by my orders to Doctor Warren, my inſtructions to the Regimental Surgeons, July 3d, and General Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington's order, matters were ſo regulated that the ſick might remain under the care of their own Surgeons, in ſuch quarters or hoſpitals as General Green himſelf might order for them; and be conſidered as parts of one General Hoſpital, of which Doctor Warren was to be eſteemed the Director and Head: They were to be allowed all neceſſary refreſhments, and the Regimental Surgeons and their ſick might partake of every advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, which the ſick in the General Hoſpital enjoyed, under the immediate care of the Hoſpital Surgeons, if the Regimental Surgeons would conſider themſelves as
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:015447_0078_0F9982C1B6446908"/>
acting under the direction of the General Hoſpital, with this only reſtriction, that every demand was to be made, and granted under the acknowledged authority of Doctor Warren, to whom I had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> all my own power for their good, for which he was to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable: And I forbad him to deliver out any ſtores, of any kind, to the Regimental Surgeons, for the ſick, not reported to, and conſidered as in the General Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital.</p>
            <p>A ſecond reaſon, is the following letter from Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Green to General Waſhington, of Auguſt 11th.</p>
            <p>A third reaſon, is my having been cenſured, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying to communicate to the Congreſs the plan of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations I had promiſed to draw up for their conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, ſo long after I had undertaken it, during all which time it was left with Gen. Green, for the benefit of his obſervations and remarks, <abbr>viz.</abbr> from about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle or end of October to the 20th of December, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I repeatedly applied to him by meſſage and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to expedite it for that purpoſe; and it was then returned to me in the ſtate I delivered it, without any remark to accompany it.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, the liberty which Doctor Story took, of making uſe of General Green's name, to ſanctify his aſſertions, that the ſufferings of the ſick lay at my door.</p>
            <p>On theſe ſeveral accounts, I now call on General Green (in a more eſpecial manner) and on any, and every other officer, of whatever rank, whether Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or Field Officers, or thoſe of inferior rank, who have thought fit to make any repreſentations, either to Congreſs as a body, or to particular Members of it, or to the Commander in Chief, concerning the cauſes of the ſufferings of the ſick, if they can lay any thing to my charge, whether relating to the diſpoſal of Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Stores, the diſpoſition of public monies, or any other article entruſted to me: I deſire to know if they can accuſe me of any neglect of duty, of indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:015447_0079_0F9982C28474C710"/>
inactivity, inattention to the calls of my ſtation, or of any breach, either of General Orders, or of the Reſolves of Congreſs: If they can do any of theſe, I ſhall be glad they will publiſh it to the world, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that will afford me an opportunity to reply, in print. Did ever any General, Field Officer, or other, on any ſuggeſtion of the ſick ſuffering for want of care, viſit the General Hoſpital, and judging with his own eyes, report to me a ſingle inſtance of the ſort? I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare they never did: So that the complaints of the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of the ſick, are not of thoſe under my care, but of thoſe that were hindered from coming, or who were never reported to the General Hoſpital, for admiſſion. On the contrary, the complaints ever were, that "<hi>whilſt in the General Hoſpital, the ſick were well taken care of, they could not enjoy the like advantages in Regimental Hoſpitals,</hi>" But if ſo, the fault of not ſending them to the General Hoſpital, is the more conſpicuous, and the wickedneſs of aſcribing the ſufferings of the ſick to the General Hoſpital, or myſelf, from whoſe care they were kept back, and which is juſtly chargeable on the Regimental Surgeons, who kept them back, and the officers who ſupported them in ſuch a contumacious diſobedience of every order, of the Congreſs and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, is the more flagrant. But, let us attend to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Green's letter.</p>

                     <salute>DEAR GENERAL,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THERE is no proper eſtabliſhment for ſupplying the Regimental Hoſpitals with proper utenſils for the ſick; they ſuffer therefore for want of proper ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation.
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:015447_0079_0F9982C28474C710"/>
There is repeated complaints on that head. The Regimental Hoſpitals are, and ever will be rendered uſeleſs, nay grievous, unleſs there is ſome proper fund, to provide the neceſſary conveniences. The General Hoſpital cannot receive all the ſick; and thoſe that are in the Regimental Hoſpitals, are in a ſuffering condition. If this evil continues, it muſt greatly injure the ſervice, as it will diſpirit the well, to ſee the ſick ſuffer, and prevent their engaging again, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any conditions whatever. Great humanity ſhould be exerciſed, towards thoſe indiſpoſed. Kindneſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one hand, leaves a favorable and laſting impreſſion, neglect and ſuffering on the other, is never forgotten.</p>
                  <p>I am ſenſible, there has formerly been great abuſes in the Regimental Hoſpitals, but I am in hopes, men of better principles are elected to thoſe places, and that the ſame evils will not happen again. But the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent had better ſuffer a little extraordinary expence, than the ſick ſhould be left to ſuffer, for want of thoſe conveniences that may be eaſily provided.</p>
                  <p>I would beg leave to propoſe, that the Colonels of regiments be allowed to draw monies, to provide the Regimental Hoſpitals, with proper utenſils; an account of the diſburſements weekly, or monthly, to be render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: This will prevent abuſe, and remedy the evil.</p>
                  <p>Something is neceſſary to be done, ſpeedily, as many ſick are in a ſuffering condition.</p>
                  <p>The General Hoſpital is well provided with every thing, and the ſick very comfortable. I wiſh it was extenſive enough to receive the whole, but it is not.</p>

            <p>I SHALL now take the liberty of propounding a few queſtions, on the contents of the above letter.</p>
            <p>WAS General Green acquainted with the reſolves of
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:015447_0080_0F9982C325C4B380"/>
Congreſs, of July 17, page 29? If ſo, has not his letter a direct tendency to oppoſe and overſet them?</p>
            <p>What reaſon can be aſſigned for Regimental Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals being eſtabliſhed on Long-Iſland, with all the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture and apparatus of a General Hoſpital, when the ſick might have the benefit of the General Hoſpital there, in compliance with General Green's own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, although a very improper place for eſtabliſhing an Hoſpital, where the enemy were expected to land, eſpecially when there was a General Hoſpital on the Iſland of New-York, for the reception of thoſe who could not be accommodated at Long-Iſland?</p>
            <p>Of what uſe could Regimental Hoſpitals be at Long-Iſland; or rather, with what diſſervice muſt they be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, when the enemy were expected to land there? Was it to retain more ſick there, to embarraſs the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, when the works were beſieged, or to keep Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Soldiers from accompanying their corps into the field, in caſe it was judged expedient to march forth, to meet the enemy at a diſtance, from the lines; or was it convenient, at ſuch times, to be diſcharging ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundreds of ſick, in the time of action, upon the Hoſpital Surgeons on the Iſland, at the ſame time with the wounded?</p>
            <p>It is ſaid the General Hoſpital cannot receive all the ſick, and thoſe in the Regimental Hoſpitals were in a ſuffering condition. Had any been reported to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Hoſpital at Long-Iſland, that were ever refuſed admiſſion? I never heard of an inſtance. But if there was no room at Long-Iſland, was there no room in the General Hoſpital at New-York? Would neither the College, with all its ſpacious apartments; the City Hoſpital, with all its great and magnificent conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences; the City Barracks, capable of accommodating above a thouſand men; the many vacant houſes in the Bowry, or neighbourhood of New-York, and whole ſtreets, appropriated for the purpoſe, and aſſigned to the Director-General, by the Convention of the State
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:015447_0080_0F9982C325C4B380"/>
of New-York, and the City Committee, and to be at his diſpoſal only: I ſay, were not all theſe ſufficient for their reception and accommodation? If not, he had the choice of moſt of the country ſeats, for the ſpace of ſeven miles from the city, to anſwer that purpoſe. And were not theſe enough?</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe it to have been neceſſary for the ſick to be accommodated on Long-Iſland: What reaſon can be aſſigned, if they were to be permitted to draw ſtores and furniture from the General Hoſpital, why they ſhould not range themſelves under the direction of Doctor Warren, which was the only poſſible method, that, with much reflexion, could be deviſed to entitle them to the neceſſaries and comforts, which it was allowed the General Hoſpital was well provided with? Could the Regimental Surgeons, who were ſo earneſt for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeparate and diſtinct Hoſpitals, have any thing in view, by remaining unaccountable for their ſupplies? What other reaſon could they have for refuſing to have the ſtate of their ſick inſpected by Hoſpital Surgeons, with a power to order ſuch ſick, as appeared to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per objects, into the General Hoſpital, but to retain as many ſick, or nominal ſick, as they pleaſed, on their liſts, till the time of an action, and then to pour them all into the General Hoſpital, and to receive the wounded under their care, for the ſake of trying ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, and of performing operations, which ſome of them had never ſeen performed? From all their actions, it is plain this was an object they had much at heart. And what would that be, but to reduce Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, of the firſt claſs in their profeſſion, to be ſubordinate to all their purpoſes, and meer miniſters of their pleaſure?</p>
            <p>For what purpoſe are ſuperior rank and greater pay allowed to Hoſpital, than to Regimental Surgeons, if not to engage men of the firſt ability, education, and experience, to take that charge upon them?</p>
            <p>And after all, is there any thing propoſed in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:015447_0081_0F9982C41698CE28"/>
Green's letter, that I had not urged before, both to General Green himſelf, as well as to General Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and the Congreſs, for the relief of the Regimental Surgeons, who might be ſituated at ſome diſtance from the General Hoſpital? Wherefore, if there could be any exception made to the plan, it muſt be to except thoſe on Long-Iſland, where it was unfit there ſhould be Regimental Hoſpitals, when the enemy were expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to land there, and when there was a General Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal at hand, of which they might have the ſame bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, with thoſe under the immediate care of the Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Surgeons and Mates; if they would ſubmit to the ſame regulations.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole of this inquiry; when the Congreſs who, for ought General Green knew to the contrary, might be ſuppoſed to have weighed matters deliberately, had fixt upon a plan, which, by every ſubſequent ſet of reſolves, reſtricted the Regimental Surgeons, within narrower limits than before; or, at leaſt, enforced the former, with new and additional weight: Where was the neceſſity, expedience, or propriety, of ſupporting the Regimental Surgeons in their clamours? They were ever backward to ſend their ſick to the General Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, to have a plea for Regimental Hoſpitals, and to draw ſtores at diſcretion, which never was allowed in any army, and which Congreſs had not ſeen fit to allow them? Would it not have been more conſiſtent with the idea of ſubmiſſion to the commands of our ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, if General Green, inſtead of giving that weight to the prejudices, and ignorance in point of duty, and in the proper management of the ſick of an army, which the Surgeons laboured under, had ſeen fit to have enjoined their making weekly returns of their ſick to the General Hoſpital, for admiſſion, agreeable to the orders of Congreſs; and thereby helped to cure or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move thoſe prejudices? This might have checked them in their career, of aſperſing reputations to accompliſh
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:015447_0081_0F9982C41698CE28"/>
their aims, and muſt have contributed to their own eaſe, and the great benefit of the ſuffering ſick.</p>
            <p>But whilſt Regimental Surgeons were ſo intent upon the eſtabliſhment of Hoſpitals for their regiments, and General Green was ſo earneſt in ſeconding their deſires, by his application to the Preſident of the Congreſs, and Commander in Chief: What was the opinion of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Waſhington, if we are to judge by his orders? They agreed with the reſolves of Congreſs: And as to the Members of Congreſs, all that I ever heard ſpeak of them, exactly correſponded with Mr. Gerry, who wrote me his opinion of the matter, in the following words: "With reſpect to ſmall Regimental Hoſpitals, I cannot but think them an unneceſſary and dangerous inſtitution; for, upon every removal of ſuch regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, thoſe Hoſpitals are a dead weight, and muſt be removed, or be expoſed to the enemy. The latter, you will agree, is by no means admiſſible; and the remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch Hoſpitals, is attended with hardſhips to the diſeaſed, and prevents them from an early recovery."</p>
            <p>Let us attend to what he next writes, of REGI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENTAL SURGEONS: "As to the REGIMENTAL SURGEONS, ſays he, being otherwiſe wholly USELESS, I have always ſuppoſed, that they were never intended to anſwer any other purpoſe, in time of war, than to cure, in camp, ſlight wounds and diſeaſes, by which the patients were not confined, and to attend the regiments, in time of action; to dreſs the wounded ſoldiers, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they can be removed to the General Hoſpital."</p>
            <p>Where perſons of rank and influence, as General Officers and Members of Congreſs, draw ſuch different ways, is it poſſible for any man, to conduct in ſuch a manner, betwixt them, as to give ſatisfaction to every one?</p>
            <p>But that it may be ſeen, how I endeavoured to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge my duty, by adhering exactly to my orders, where they reſtricted me to a point; and yet in pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials accommodated myſelf, as well as I could, to the
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:015447_0082_0F9982C4A43D9E50"/>
reaſonable deſires of others: I ſhall here publiſh a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of my directions, to Doctor Warren, for eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and for the manner of conducting the Hoſpitals, under his care, at LONG-ISLAND.</p>

                  <p>YOU are deſired to go over to Long-Iſland, and to conſult with General Green, about the proper houſes for the forming of an Hoſpital (to be part of the General Hoſpital) for the reception of the ſick in his Brigade. For your aſſiſtants you will be pleaſed to take over three of the Hoſpital Mates, of which Mr. Glover is to be one, the other two as you agree with the other Surgeons.</p>
                  <p>Make out a proper aſſortment of medicines, ſuch a liſt as you think needful, after conſulting with Doctors Foſter Adams and M'Knight, and order it to be put up from the Hoſpital ſtores: If you have occaſion for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſiſtants, make a requiſition from General Green's Brigade, of as many Surgeons and Mates as you ſhall ſtand in need of.</p>
                  <p>Keep a regiſter of the ſick, in which you are to make an entry of the times of their admiſſion and diſcharge, as well as of the diſeaſes they labour under, and require of the reſpective Surgeons of the different regiments, weekly returns of the ſick in the Hoſpital belonging to their regiments, in order to compare with yours: From which, once a month, a roll is to be made out for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the ration money, from the Commiſſary Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; which you will get ſigned by the Brigadier-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, after you have compared it with the return of ſick born on the rolls of the Regimental Surgeons: From the time they are admitted into the General Hoſpital,
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:015447_0082_0F9982C4A43D9E50"/>
their rations are to be ſtopped in the regiments. The liſt of the Regimental Surgeons, compared with yours, ought to be delivered by them to the Adjutant, or Quartermaſter of every regiment, in order to prevent rations being drawn for the ſick, in the regiments, ſo long as they remain in the hoſpital.</p>
                  <p>You will be pleaſed to fix up, in the hoſpital, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations already agreed upon by the Surgeons of the Hoſpital, for the government of the officers, nurſes, attendants and patients; and appoint ſome perſon to have them read in every ward: The rules of diet, ought to be fixed up in the ſame place, and a ſtrict at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention paid to the ſame.</p>
                  <p>You are to take over Mr. Weld, to act as a Store-keeper, who is to obey your commands in all things relating to his department: Whatever ſtores you have occaſion for, in the department of the Commiſſary-General, or Quartermaſter-General, you will apply for by an order under your hand, ſigned by order of the Director-General, with your name, of which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the Storekeeper to keep an exact account, and of the diſtribution of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>What nurſes you require for the ſick, you will engage at the price of half a dollar per week; the number not to exceed one for every ten perſons, ſick or wounded; the neceſſary labourers to be employed by the day, as uſual, in which avoid engaging a greater number than is abſolutely neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>Deliver out no ſtores of any kind to the Regimental Surgeons: When the ſick require further aids than they can give, let them be reported to you, and if their caſes require, receive them into the General Hoſpital.</p>
                  <p>Take with you at leaſt 1500 bandages, and a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of tow, with a ſet of capital inſtruments, and all ſuitable dreſſings, in caſe of an action.</p>
                  <p>Uſe your beſt endeavours to make the Surgeons and Mates of the regiments attentive to their duty.</p>
                  <p>For any debts contracted for the uſe of the General-Hoſpital,
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:015447_0083_0F9982C5E6A20F78"/>
agreeable to the above rules, draw on me. You will employ the ſame perſon to ſupply freſh meat, and at the ſame prices, as in the hoſpital at New-York.</p>
                  <p>Weekly returns of the ſick to be ſent over early eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Monday morning as uſual.</p>

            <p>And now, whilſt I am on the ſubject of ortlers iſſued by me, to the different Gentlemen, for the better ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the General Hoſpital, on whoſe care I was to depend principally, for their being carried into exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, I muſt take the liberty to obſerve, that were I to tranſcribe all I have delivered to them, in writing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for that purpoſe, it would require a ſeparate vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume.</p>
            <p>To Doctor Foſter, as being the eldeſt Surgeon, I wrote much and often; and have now before me, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of various orders to him, in a ſeries of letters, &amp;c. of
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:015447_0084_0F9982C621B98F68"/>
which I will only mention dates, and occaſions, without detaining the reader with particulars. The firſt (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out date) was on his ſetting out from Cambridge, about the latter end of March, or beginning of April, 1776, to eſtabliſh a General Hoſpital, at New-York. The next, likewiſe from Cambridge, April 22d: The next was at New-York, on my ſetting out from thence, for the management of the Hoſpital in my abſence, whilſt I proceeded to Philadelphia, to apply to Congreſs for further inſtructions, though I came away without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining them, but not without application, and as long time of attendance, as the General would allow me. The next, were dated at New-York, Auguſt 5th, the 19th, the 23d, and 27th; and September the 9th. The next, was alſo at New-York, September the 13th, for the intended removal of the ſick and wounded, to Newark, reſpecting the manner of their removal, and the proviſion to be made for them, on that occaſion, and for taking care of them, by the way. The next are dated September 24, October 18, and 20; November 3d, and 6th; whilſt he had the care and ſuperintendance of the ſick at Newark; and of December the 10th and 31ſt; and January the 10th, at Bethlehem, for remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val to the eaſt ſide of Hudſon's River.</p>
            <p>Numerous and particular are the directions, which, in like manner, I have delivered in writing, on various occaſions, as well as verbally, to Doctors Warren, Adams, M'Knight, Turner, and Euſtis, Surgeons in the General Hoſpital; on their being detached to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent places, for the eſtabliſhment of Hoſpitals, for the conveniency of the ſick, in parts diſtant from each other, in which my directions were drawn up with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and not in a careleſs, negligent, or perfunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory manner; for that was neither the way, in which I choſe to do buſineſs myſelf, or to require others to perform it, who were ſubject to my authority.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now explain another difficulty, to which I was often ſubjected.</p>
            <p>

IT was no unuſual thing for Officers and Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Surgeons, on detached poſts, wherever they happened to be ſtationed, though ever ſo diſtant from the main body of the army, whether on a march, or a retreat, to expect a General Hoſpital to accompany, or follow them in the rear; as if it were poſſible, like the Polypus, though cut up into ever ſo many pieces, that each part ſhould inſtantly repullulate, and become an entire Hoſpital, properly furniſhed with every ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary accommodation, attendants, and conveniences, although amidſt Highlands, alps, or a forſaken and waſted country, without any help or aſſiſtance from thoſe who had the command; or, as if it were poſſible to ſave, or remove the weighty and cumberſome appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus, every where, with as much expedition as they could retreat, and without any regard to the unfitneſs of the place for a General Hoſpital.</p>
            <p>I hope no intention of diſreſpect will be imputed to me, when I am ſometimes neceſſarily obliged to make uſe of the names of Gentlemen of rank, for whom I have a perſonal and due reſpect, in the courſe of relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing facts, which the vindication of my conduct requires I ſhould diſcuſs, with all becoming freedom, I think it proper to guard againſt ſuch a wrong ſuppoſition, on the preſent occaſion.</p>
            <p>At a time when I had formed General Hoſpitals at Newark, Hackinſack, North-Caſtle, Stamford, and Norwalk, all crowded with ſick, to the number of near 4000 men; and of courſe, the Hoſpital Surgeons, who were not numerous, ſtationed at various diſtances, through a ſpace of near an hundred miles, were fully em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, I received a letter from General Heath, at Peek's-Kill; of all places I have ſeen one of the worſt, that could be thought of for a General Hoſpital, as well for want of accommodations, as of a proper coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to ſupport it: It bore date, November the 19th, on which he obſerved, that there was neither General Hoſpital, nor any one General Hoſpital Surgeon, at
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:015447_0085_0F9982CB835921C8"/>
that poſt; that he received daily complaints from the Colonels of the ſeveral regiments, of the ſufferings and diſtreſſes of the Regimental ſick; and that "the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of them, was likely to prove very prejudicial to the inliſtment of a new army."</p>
            <p>From the ſimilarity of language in this letter, the complaints of officers concerning the ſufferings of the ſick, and the evil conſequences that were predicted of their proving prejudicial to the inliſtment of a new army, I was apprehenſive of the latent influence, and was determined, if I could any ways prevent it, they ſhould not have it in their power to lay the fault at my door. I might, indeed, have remonſtrated to the General, that it was the duty of the Regimental Surgeons to ſend their ſick, whom they could not take care of, to the neareſt branch of the General Hoſpital, wherever I thought it moſt convenient for fixing it, and which I never did, without firſt adviſing with the officers who were in chief command, that they might be properly taken care of: But inſtead of that, the General Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal was expected to attend every movement of theirs, not ſo much for ſending their ſick into it, as to claim ſupplies from it, or Hoſpital Surgeons to attend their regiments as was ſometimes required, whilſt they were abſent, and ſcattered through the neighbouring States, in purſuing the uniform ſcheme they conſtantly kept in view, of eſtabliſhing Regimental Hoſpitals, for which they explored diſtant towns, and retired to them with part of their ſick: Theſe places became an aſylum for idleneſs, riot and diſſipation, for when once they got into ſuch places, they were in no haſte to return, and the numbers that reſorted to them, increaſed amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
            <p>On receipt of General Heath's letter, I determined to ride from North-Caſtle to Peek's-Kill, to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and concert the neceſſary ſteps to be taken, for accompliſhing his deſire, which I did; but firſt, I repreſented to him, how impracticable the deſign of
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:015447_0085_0F9982CB835921C8"/>
having a General Hoſpital there was, unleſs convenient quarters were firſt in readineſs; that the providing quarters for the reception of the men being in the Quartermaſter General's department, was under Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Heath's command, and not in my power; but if he would undertake to give ſuch orders, as would be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, for the appropriating and fitting up rooms and births, for 300 ſick, and would enforce obedience to the orders of Congreſs, October 9th, to allow no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimental Hoſpitals in the neighbourhood of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Hoſpital; and would call on the Regimental Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, to remain with their reſpective corps, agreeable to General Waſhington's pleaſure, of November 5; and to make ſuch regular returns of the ſick, that I could know the ſtate of them; ordering ſome atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants on the Hoſpital, that would be much wanted, I would forthwith ſend a detachment of the General Hoſpital to attend his commands. I acquainted him, that it would anſwer no purpoſe, but to bring unmerit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reproach on the hoſpital, if Gentlemen were ſent up to take charge of it, and, when they came, no quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters could be had for their accommodation, or that of the ſick<note n="*" place="bottom">See my complaince on this head, page 45.</note>.</p>
            <p>That the nature of the eſtabliſhment and manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Military Hoſpital might be the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, I drew up, November 20, an account of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was neceſſary, for providing quarters and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations, furniſhing of ſupplies, and for the regular admiſſion, care and attendants on the ſick, with the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary reports to be made, from time to time, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct matters with regularity, and to diſcover who do their duty, and who neglect it; ſo that if complaints are made of the ſufferings of the ſick, it may be known where the fault lies, and how to correct it. Theſe I encloſed in my letter to him.</p>
            <p>In return, the General "thanked me by letter, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of my care and attention, and commended my
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:015447_0086_0F9982CF253C6CC8"/>
plans and directions; and, as General Sullivan had done before, promiſed to take care that they were, in every reſpect, carried into execution."</p>
            <p>Doctor Adams, and Doctor M'Knight, ſucceſſively waited upon General Heath, by my deſire, to requeſt that he would order ſuch quarters, for the ſick at Peek's-Kill, as were neceſſary for a General Hoſpital, which they were to direct; but never could be provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any proper accommodations, when they were there; but, were obliged to croſs the Highlands, to Fiſh-Kills, twenty miles off, before they could meet with any ſuitable place, for the reception and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation of the ſick.</p>
            <p>Of the clamours of Regimental Surgeons, from want of Medicines.</p>
            <p>OF all the complaints that have been made in reſpect to the ſufferings of the ſick, none have been ſo loud and clamorous, as thoſe proceeding from a want, or pretended want of medicines. I proceed, therefore, to examine into the nature and cauſes of thoſe complaints, and I doubt not, to be able to convince the impartial world, and Congreſs itſelf, that whether or not the Gentlemen, that compoſe that illuſtrious body, can juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exculpate themſelves from the charge of neglect, in not providing the neceſſary ſupplies of medicines, for the Regimental Surgeons, and furniſhing them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with in ſeaſon to be of uſe to them, I am free from any merited blame, on that account. And I wiſh the reader to remark, that the complaints, on account of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the ſick, from want of medicines, were but mere whiſpers before the battle and retreat from Long-Iſland, compared to the clamours from that time forwards.</p>
            <p>From the day of that retreat, Auguſt 28, 1776, a dreadful ſcene of confuſion and diſorder took place, which had a particular effect in disjointing all the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Regimental Surgeons, and involving the
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:015447_0086_0F9982CF253C6CC8"/>
affairs of the General Hoſpital department, ſo far as it was complicated therewith, in the greateſt difficulties, for the remainder of the year</p>
            <p>Theſe misfortunes were increaſed by the obſtinacy of the Regimental Surgeons, in withſtanding the orders of Congreſs; in which they were ſtill ſupported by offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, who, to put the moſt favourable conſtruction on their motives, were either not acquainted with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations of Congreſs reſpecting them, or not ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the duties of Regimental Surgeons, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Military Hoſpitals; or they were owing to the want of a proper arrangement in ſettling the duties of the Regimental Surgeons, and providing them with the proper means of diſcharging thoſe duties. This may be imputed to the vaſt variety of buſineſs, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly occupied the Congreſs, which did not leave them ſufficient leiſure to attend to them, or their not ſufficiently underſtanding the ſubject, from the defect of experience, on the firſt raiſing of an army; whereas they ought to have been early provided with medicines, inſtruments and bandages, by a Continental Druggiſt, or choſen Committee, before the campaign began: And the militia which came late to the field, ſhould have been provided by the different States, before they joined the army: Some of them did not come till juſt before, and many not till after the retreat from Long-Iſland; and then came wholly unprovided with thoſe articles, at a time when it was impoſſible, if there had been ever ſo great a plenty of medicines in the hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital or army, ſubject, as both were, to continual move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and when the officers of the hoſpital were divided, and as buſily employed as men could be in taking care of the ſick and wounded, to diſpenſe them out to all applyers.</p>
            <p>I early foreſaw that this evil might happen, and as ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pointed it out to the General, in the month of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary, for the ſake of applying a remedy, and of not being burdened with the charge of it, as may be ſeen in my letter to him, page 32. The contents of this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:015447_0087_0F9982CF2AB8FB30"/>
I alſo communicated to Congreſs, the firſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> I had for doing it, in perſon, which was in June following.</p>
            <p>And after the retreat from Long-Iſland, I deſcribed my own ſituation to them, and that of the Regimental Surgeons, in the live left terms I could, praying for farther aſſiſtance, and pointing out the means of it, without ſucceſs, as my letters to different members of the Medical Committee, will abundantly prove; but all my applications, on this ſubject, were in vain. I never received the leaſt aſſiſtance from them.</p>
            <p>In my narrative to General Waſhington, from page 7, to page 12, I have deſcribed what pains I had been at, to make proviſion of medicines, for the Regiment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Surgeons, and to have the mode of furniſhing the ſupplies clearly and properly eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>To what I then wrote, I have now to add ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obſervations, to free me from any miſrepreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, on this head.</p>
            <p>When I made an offer of my beſt ſervices to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Committee of Congreſs, to ſupply the Regiment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Surgeons at New-York, with regimental cheſts, though not in my line of duty to do ſo; it was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I wiſhed for the employ, being already burdened with much more buſineſs than belonged to my place, but becauſe I did not find that Congreſs had taken any ſtep for the purpoſe; and was apprehenſive, leſt when the evil ariſing from the neglect thereof, ſhould be more ſenſibly felt and complained of, the ill conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of that neglect would be charged upon me; and I expected thereby to get rid of a ſtill greater evil, with which I heard I was threatened, as I told the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, that of being called on to furniſh the hoſpitals and regiments, in the northern department, with inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, medicines, &amp;c. a thing impracticable in my ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, and in the exhauſted ſtate of America in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to them. And I ſtill expected, if Congreſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of my propoſal, they would have appointed an
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:015447_0087_0F9982CF2AB8FB30"/>
apothecary for the army, diſtinct from the hoſpital; or to have had the medicines put up at Philadelphia, in proper cheſts for regiments, to be ſent to camp, duly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, of which I left with the Committee a proper liſt for the purpoſe. But what is ſurprizing, they never gave me any anſwer to theſe propoſals, ſo that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding I engaged in the buſineſs, I never was proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly authorized, or aſſiſted for the diſcharge of that ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh employment; although, it ſeems, I was anſwerable for the conſequences of my offer, as though I had been enabled, in every reſpect, to perform it.</p>
            <p>Far be it from me, to charge the Committee with neglect in this buſineſs. All I mean is to defend my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt any imputation. What anſwer did they ever give me on that ſubject? None, except what is contained in a reſolve of Congreſs, July 17th, of which I knew nothing, till that month was nearly expired; for when I was obliged by the General's order to return to camp, they had come to no determination. Nor, do thoſe reſolves enjoin it as a duty: They only forbid the Regimental Surgeons to draw any thing from the hoſpital, except inſtruments and medicines</p>
            <p>That it was not the intention, however, of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, to give them a right to demand theſe, except, as mentioned in the printed letter, page 72, (a copy of which I had laid before the Committee in June.) in ſmall quantities, only to ſerve them till they could be ſupplied from any neighbouring place, is evident from the following conſideration.</p>
            <p>The Congreſs had committed their ſtock of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines at Philadelphia, into the hands of Mr. William Smith, and by a vote of theirs appointed him Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental Druggiſt, or Commiſſary of Medicinal Stores, for which they allowed him pay, equal to go dollars per month. What was I to conclude from hence, but that the Congreſs had ſeen ſit, and proper it was it ſhould have done it long before to relieve me from a taſk foreign to my ſtation, and to provide a perſon on
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:015447_0088_0F9982CFE88E8D98"/>
purpoſe to ſupply the wants of the Regimental Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons: And that this was their idea, will appear far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther probable, if it may be ſuppoſed the mind of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs was known to one of their Members, who, ſome time after this, in a letter he wrote to me, expreſſes himſelf as follows: "With reſpect to ſupplying the Regimental Surgeons with medicines, I am fully of opinion that the Directors cannot well attend to it, but the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ought to be to them; in the firſt inſtance, and they to ſign orders on the Continental Druggiſt, for ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cheſts as they ſhall judge neceſſary, and have the medicines aſſorted, as they ſhall think proper."</p>
            <p>IN REGARD TO INSTRUMENTS; anxious to have it in my power to furniſh the hoſpitals more plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as I had found it neceſſary to increaſe the number of Hoſpital Surgeons and Mates, and to recruit my ſtock of medicines, which was almoſt wholly exhauſted of capital articles, I ſent Doctor Bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y to Philadelphia, a gentleman of the hoſpital, in whoſe zeal and activity I placed great reliance, to forward to camp, with all diſpatch, what medicines I had there of my own, and as much as he could procure from Congreſs, for I could not be ſufficiently ſupplied at New-York. I enjoined him to uſe the utmoſt diligence to purchaſe inſtruments, if to be had, ready made, or to engage a workman to make a great number of ſets, on my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. He ſoon informed me, by letter, that there were no inſtruments to be purchaſed at any rate; and that the only workman in the city that could make ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon's inſtruments was engaged by Mr. Marſhall, for the Congreſs; and that he could not undertake any work for me, for a long time to come. Is not this an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional proof that Congreſs, in their reſolves of July 17th, did not intend to make me anſwerable for the ſupplying of Regimental Surgeons, either with medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines or inſtruments; or, if it was their intention that I ſhould furniſh them; why did they not enable me to do it?

It was then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to attempt, if not impracticable to get them over to New-York; on which account, till the army abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the city, and the hoſpital ſtores were all removed to Newark, they remained there, where they had been left, except ſome articles which were wanted to ſupply the General Hoſpital, formed at this time near Kingſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, towards which place the army had retreated. I fixed Mr. Cutting, Aſſiſtant Apothecary, at Newark, which I conſidered as the moſt convenient and proper place at the time, for ſtoring the medicines I had col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected there, and referred ſuch Regimental Surgeons, as applied to me for medicines, to him. This being my magazine of all that were moſt valuable, or moſt in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, I felt the loſs more ſenſibly, when they were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of my hands, in ſo irregular a manner, as I have already deſcribed in the firſt part of this work.</p>
            <p>IN no part of the vaſt variety of duty and fatigue that I went through, have I been ſo ſenſible of ILL TREATMENT, as in what related to the ſupplies of medicines and hoſpital ſtores, except the more ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and injurious manner in which I was deprived of them. It is next to impoſſible, to deſcribe the toils that myſelf, and moſt of the Gentlemen of the hoſpital, have endured in that buſineſs; and the injurious reflex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions that have been caſt upon me, for conducting this affair, in a way the moſt meritorious, is truly matter of aſtoniſhment, and only to be equalled by the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I met with from Congreſs, in return for all thoſe ſervices.</p>
            <p>To judge of this matter clearly, it is neceſſary to call to mind the difficulties under which I laboured for want
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:015447_0089_0F9982D0B233A388"/>
of ſufficient help, to conſider the ſcarcity and value of medicines, and how troubleſome or impracticable to procure them, in quantity, in America. I found no large ſtock on hand, when I firſt took charge of the hoſpital, to ſupply the vaſt demands of an army, in which generally more is waſted than uſed: The ſtricteſt oeconomy was alſo enjoined me, in ſupplying the wants of the hoſpital, however much the plan of Congreſs is now changed. It is worth obſerving here, that the firſt piece of buſineſs the Congreſs employed me in, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my appointment to the Director-Generalſhip, was to look over a liſt of medicines made out by my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor, and not a large one, to ſupply the immediate wants of the hoſpital: A Committee of Congreſs put it into my hands, not ſo much, as I could underſtand, to add to it, if I thought neceſſary, as to curtail it: What was ſaid on the occaſion, at leaſt, looked that way. With ſuch views, ſuch wants, and ſuch oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my demands were made on me, from all quarters of the army, and out of the army, to diſtant parts of the country. All the aſſiſtance Congreſs allowed by their original eſtabliſhment to procure aſſort, prepare and diſpenſe medicines, was one apothecary It being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to perform this ſervice, without further help, a mate had been employed before my arrival, and an aſſiſtant with little more than ſoldiers pay, whom I alſo found here on my arrival, and continued him in his place, without being allowed any other help, till the year was almoſt over; when the Congreſs by their third reſolve of October 9, 1776, at once, enjoined me to furniſh ſuch further quantities of medicines and bedding, as I might judge expedient, and impowered another, at the ſame time, to deprive me of what I had, with toil and fatigue immenſe, collected, and ſaved from deſtruction.</p>
            <p>To be ordered by the General to collect medicinal ſtores, in the manner already mentioned, and to be abuſed and calumniated for performing that duty; and after ſupplying cheſts to five battalions at Boſton, near
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:015447_0089_0F9982D0B233A388"/>
fifty at New-York, and ſent twenty more to the nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern department, and furniſhed the hoſpitals at Long-Iſland, New-York, Newark, Hackinſack, and Kings-bridge; and when I made demands on the Continental Druggiſt for a ſmall ſupply, to aſſort what remained on hand, not to be furniſhed with that neceſſary ſupply, was hard to be born: And yet to be baited like a bear at the ſtake, with inceſſant demands, and made reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for the clamours of the Regimental Surgeons, for all the wants of new troops daily arriving, without ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, and for the ſufferings of the ſick, ariſing from their oppoſition to General Orders; and ſo artfully excited that if I was at the General Hoſpital, crys were raiſed becauſe I was not at camp, and if at camp, that they could not meet me at the General Hoſpital, was not leſs intolerable. The ſame noiſe pervaded from the remoteſt towns in the neighbouring States, to which the Regimental Surgeons had conveyed the ſick, beyond the reach of relief, to terrify and alarm the country. Nor were theſe circumſtances ſufficient to fill up the meaſure of my diſtreſs. The moſt affecting repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations were made to the General, from the diſtance of ſeveral hundred miles, aſcribing the misfortunes of the army, ready to mutiny at the northward, to me, when I had early acquainted Congreſs with their ſituation, and prayed for relief for them in vain, although no part of my care. And notwithſtanding I had ſent them what I could ſpare from my own ſtock, and officers to aſſiſt them, at the earneſt requeſt of the director; I never met with the leaſt acknowledgment for theſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices from the Congreſs but, on the contrary, the ſtrangeſt and moſt uncival returns from the Secretary, only for preſuming to inquire of him, concerning the nature of the appointments Congreſs had made in ſome other departments, for the care of the ſick, that I might the better underſtand, and underſtanding, better perform my own duty. Can there be a more ſtriking inſtance of ingratitude than I have met in the whole of
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:015447_0090_0F9982D1712D33F0"/>
my treatment, where the obligations to ſhew me a very different one, for my attention to, and for the manner of diſcharging my truſt, were neither ſmall nor few.</p>
            <p>I ſhall here relate an inſtance of inſolent and injurious treatment I met with, for what I had not done, in place of thanks for what I had done to ſerve the nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern department. It is contained in a letter from a certain Parſon David Avery to Doctor Lind, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded by him to the General, in September laſt; in which, after giving a high wrought deſcription of the ſufferings of the ſick, at the lakes, for want of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, he introduces this virulent aſperſion: "Men of chief conſideration, (ſays he) are more than unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy on this head, and do not heſitate to ſpeak freely of firſt rate characters, as the authors of thoſe calamities, ſome blaming the Congreſs, and ſome the Surgeon-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, (meaning the Director-General) of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Army, and ſome the Director of the Northern De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment. For my part, continues this reverend ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniator, I will not ſay which of them is the moſt guilty, but this I will affirm, that great guilt lies at ſome one's door." Strange that a preacher of the goſpel, which breathes charity to all, and eſpecially to ſtrangers, ſhould carry the poiſon of aſps under his tongue, and ſpout forth his venom at this indiſcriminate rate, againſt perſons whom he knows little of, as is the caſe at leaſt of one that had nothing to do in this matter, but as an act of extra-official benevolence, and who, though oppreſſed, as he was, with the greatneſs of his own burden, ſtrove to mitigate and lighten that of others! And ſuch are the grateful returns made to him for it.</p>
            <p>BUT a circumſtance that happened at that time, which I think of the moſt conſequence to explain ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the public is the REMOVAL of part of the HOSPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAL STORES from New-York to Stamford, previous to
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:015447_0090_0F9982D1712D33F0"/>
the evacuation of Long-Iſland, and from thence to the interior parts of Connecticut; as this tranſaction was laid hold of as a handle of cenſure againſt me, and induced the General, by one of his aids, to write to, and acquaint me with the miſerable ſituation to which the ſick were reduced, and the clamours excited, as it was alledged, (but without reaſon,) for want of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines as ſet forth in my narrative, page 12, and 13. I ſhall now prove the truth of what I there alledged; that it was by his Excellency's own order, that I ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the ſtores which were ſent to Stamford; and the ſending them from thence farther inland, was by his commands, of which I had no knowledge at the time, whence the General himſelf, and every other reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſon, muſt be ſo far from condemning, that they cannot, in juſtice, but approve my conduct. This ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count will likewiſe evince the impracticability of what he afterwards inſiſted upon I ſhould comply with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately; but will ſhew, at the ſame time, that it was undertaken with all diligence, and executed with all poſſible diſpatch.</p>
            <p>Sanguine as the generality of men unexperienced in military operations were, that the ſtrength of our works, and ſo large an army as we had, were ſufficient to defend New-York, againſt all the force that could be brought againſt it; others, of better underſtanding and cooler judgment, had great abatements in their belief of it. At any rate, they concluded it was very poſſible the town might be deſtroyed by the ſhipping, whether a landing was effected or not. Had a ſhell fallen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the combuſtible articles of medicines, the whole might be deſtroyed, to the irreparable loſs of the army. I therefore aſked the General what he thought of removing thoſe articles that could be beſt ſpared for the preſent, and mentioned Stamford, as a place to which they might be eaſily tranſported by water, and from whence they might, at any proper time, when wanted, be brought back either by water or land. He
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:015447_0091_0F9982D22763D4F0"/>
not only approved of the propoſition for their remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, but ordered it to be carried into execution, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditiouſly as I could. At this time, being the month of Auguſt, I had as I imagined, ſupplied almoſt every regiment in the army, with medicine cheſts: But freſh demands occurring every day, and the want of a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port veſſel, impeded the performance of the General's commands, for ſome weeks.</p>
            <p>It being in the moſt violent heat of ſummer, and ſo the leſs wanted, I ordered the greater part of the rugs and blankets, the neweſt and beſt bedding, of which I had collected a very large ſtock, and a thouſand ſheets of which I had lately got to the amount of near two thouſand, many of them new, and a number of new ſhirts, at New-York, to be ſet apart for the purpoſe; and a large quantity of heavy hoſpital furniture, ſome of the largeſt beſt metal and iron mortars, a number of crates of vials and gaily pots, the largeſt bottles, with the moſt bulky articles, and thoſe in the leaſt demand, as ſome hogſheads and caſks of caſcarilla, and other ſuch particulars as we could beſt ſpare, to accompany them. To theſe, I ordered a ſhare of whatever we had in ſo great a plenty, as not to fear being ſoon deſtitute of them, to be added, with a ſmall aſſort me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of choſen medicines, to be made up, and kept together in one or two ſuitable boxes, as a reſerve, moſt likely to be wanted, and the moſt eaſily to be got at, on any preſſing occaſion. In the mean while the Britiſh troops landed at Long-Iſland, and many officers and ſome Surgeons, perhaps the very men, who were afterwards foremoſt in the clamour, for want of medicines, came to the hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, and expreſſing their apprehenſions for the ſafety, took upon them to be very importunate for the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of the hoſpital ſtores. I met the Adjutant-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and told him in what ſtate they were, and as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of ſome frigates being ſhortly expected to appear in the ſound prevailed, I propoſed, once more, to know the General's mind, with regard to the removal of the
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:015447_0091_0F9982D22763D4F0"/>
ſtores: He told me he had heard the General expreſs himſelf on the ſubject very lately, with wiſhes of their being gone; whereupon he, believing it to be ſo, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him of ſuch his aſſurance, that they were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſent away; and urged me to loſe no time to have it done. A ſmall tranſport being forth with engaged, the abovementioned ſtores, amounting to eighteen tons, were immediately put on board, and ſent off, under the care of Doctor Ledyard, of the hoſpital; they were ſafely landed at Stamford, and committed to the care of John Lloyd, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of that place, who ſtored them in his own houſe.</p>
            <p>An apprehenſion and alarm prevailing ſoon after, that the enemy were about to make a ſudden deſcent upon that place, and might deſtroy the ſtores if not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved farther from the ſound; Mr. Lloyd wrote to the General on the ſubject, and received his commands in return; in purſuance of which the Committee had them removed further into the interior country, and particularly the moſt valuable were conveyed to no leſs a diſtance than fifty miles, for ſafety; of which I had no notice at the time, but have ſince obtained a copy of the General's order for their removal, and a certificate from the Committee at Stamford, of their removal, in virtue of the General's ſaid order, contained in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing letter.</p>

            <p>Long-Iſland was abandoned to the Britiſh troops, 3 days before the date of the above letter; and in leſs than 3 weeks more, New-York alſo fell into their hands. With difficulty could the remaining hoſpital ſtores be ſaved, by tranſporting them, over the North River to the Jerſeys, and thence to Newark. And yet it was within ten days, from that time, and whilſt I was taking meaſures to overlook and put in order the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, and to get a freſh liſt of capital articles, wanted to aſſort them, that, owing to the clamours beforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, I received that ſevere and unmerited reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, quoted in my narrative, page 13.</p>
            <p>I wrote to Philadelphia for medicines, but could get none, or next to none. The Gentlemen, to whom I wrote, acquainted me their ſhops were exhauſted. From the Continental Druggiſt I obtained a very ſmall ſupply indeed, with a proper apology for it.</p>
            <p>Under all theſe difficulties, I did not ſlacken my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to obtain a ſupply. I ſent through the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent States of New-England, and applied, in perſon, to the State of New-York, at Fiſh-Kills, and, not long after, had hoſpitals eſtabliſhed at Stamford and Norwalk, well ſupplied with medicines and other ſtores, the former of which, received into it above 12,00 pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, who were comfortably provided for, under the care of Doctor Philip Turner, moſt of whom recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and the latter above 700, under the care of Doctor
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:015447_0092_0F9982D2EA891578"/>
Euſtis; both of whom furniſhed, from the hoſpital, all Regimental Surgeons who applied, with whatever medicines they called for, to the full of their demands. By the exacteſt accounts and returns of the patients re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the hoſpital at Stamford, from November 5th, to the time of my diſmiſſion being known there, in February following, the amount was near thirteen hundred, of whom the number, remaining in the hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, was then reduced to twenty-five, in all. Doctor Euſtis informed me, that upwards of ſeven hundred ſick and wounded were well provided for, by means with which I had ſufficiently furniſhed him, whom he was enabled to attend, much to their ſatisfaction; and that when he left Norwalk, in March, the number re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining was reduced to eight or ten.</p>

WERE it neceſſary to produce other evidences of the pains I took to acquaint Congreſs of the ſuffering condition of the ſick, I could refer to a number of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters I have written to ſeveral of the members, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a particular hiſtory of the movements of the hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals and ſick, during the whole campaign, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to Mr. Gerry, Member for Maſſachuſetts-Bay, and Doctor Ruſh, of Philadelphia, and eſpecially in a letter I wrote to the former, October 6th.</p>
            <p>In that letter I informed him "of the great cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours that prevailed, at the time, amongſt the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Surgeons, becauſe they could not be ſupplied with every thing they wanted, from the General Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, of which I gave him a full and juſt repreſentation. It contained, likewiſe, a long and particular relation of all my proceedings in the care of my department, from the time I entered into the ſervice, to that period, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to what I have delivered in my narrative to General Waſhington. I pointed out to him the ſtate of the Regimental Surgeons, ever ſince I entered into the ſervice, and the deſtitute condition they were in, at my firſt arrival in the army, in reſpect to all ſorts of ſtores, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments and medicines. I acquainted him with the pains I had been at, to furniſh them with neceſſaries, and the extent to which I had done it, with my appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to the General and Congreſs to ſettle the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels of ſupply, and with the applications to me from Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada, for that purpoſe. I let him know, that I had ſent off to the amount of twenty regimental cheſts, for the troops at Lake George and Albany, beſides what I had ſent to General Gates at Ticonderoga, (excluſive of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt forty and fifty regimental medicine cheſts, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the forces under the immediate command of General Waſhington,) and acquainted him with what had been ſent by the General's order to Stamford."</p>
            <p>"I further gave him as exact a deſcription, as it was in my power, of the ſtate of the ſick and wounded, and of the unuſual complaints amongſt the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

the continual viciſſitude in the ſtate of the ſick, from the various movements of the army, and conſequent ſhiftings of the hoſpital; and of the difficulties to which this reduced the officers employed in attending it; of the neceſſity we were under to remove the ſtores and ſick to Newark; and the obſtacles we had to overcome, under many inconveniences, to convey them to a place of ſafety, and to provide them with quarters; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, I told him of the unruly behaviour of the ſurgeons of the militia regiments and their tumultuous appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations for medicines; and informed him how widely they were ſcattered through the country; of the deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome of the Regimental Surgeons, and the calls on the Mates of the Hoſpital to ſupply their places."</p>
            <p>"I concluded my letter to him with the following obſervations: "Upon the whole matter, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me, that a general miſtake prevailed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the duty of the Regimental Surgeons, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which they ought to be furniſhed with inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, medicines and neceſſary ſtores. I gave it as my opinion, in the moſt expreſs terms, that they ought not to depend on the General Hoſpital for them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, in its preſent exhauſted condition, and the looſe ſtate in which every thing was, from the ſcattered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the ſick, and the vaſt variety of duty, and infinite fatigue of the department, it was impoſſible for me to furniſh the Regimental Surgeons, and not eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially injure, or totally overthrow the General Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. And obſerved to him, that whilſt there was ſuch a limitation in the number of ſurgeons and other offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in the hoſpital, and the Regimental Surgeons could claim any right to depend upon it for ſupply of what they required, it muſt ſoon be entirely exhauſted of the means of anſwering its deſign, and be rendered wholly uſeleſs. I therefore recommended to Congreſs, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of proper perſons, to look out, and purchaſe medicines ſufficient for a ſtore to be formed at Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, from whence what might be wanting for regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:015447_0094_0F9982D56EAD2C48"/>
uſe, could be ſent up in proper cheſts to every Regimental Surgeon, as his occaſions required."</p>
            <p>"Thus, I obſerved, being ſomewhat more diſengaged from the preſent innumerable calls on me, that were foreign to my duty, I ſhould enjoy more leiſure for what were proper to my ſtation, and then would ſketch out ſome further plan for the better government of the General Hoſpital and Regimental Surgeons, and the beſt means of furniſhing the needful ſupplies." And, ſoon after, I ſent ſuch a liſt of medicinal ſtores and ſurgeons inſtruments, &amp;c. as I concluded would be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for an army of 20,000 men, for a twelvemonth, including both hoſpitals and regiments.</p>
            <p>I accordingly drew up the above mentioned plan in a few days after, by the General's Orders; which being firſt ſubmitted to his remarks, and thoſe of Lord Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and of General M'Dougall, as it was agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was then forwarded ſhortly after, by General M'Dougall, to General Green, that his remarks being added, it might be returned to me, with all diſpatch, to compare the whole, and reviſe it for laying before the Congreſs.</p>
            <p>As General Green had ſhewn ſo much zeal in the affair, and had made ſuch warm repreſentations, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively, to General Waſhington, and to the Preſident of the Congreſs, on the ſubject, ſetting forth, that if the preſent evil was not quickly remedied, it would fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally injure the ſervice: I did not doubt, that he would give it all poſſible diſpatch, and ſend it to me, ſo ſoon as he could examine it. But although I wrote, and ſent meſſage after meſſage, I could never get it again, till a few days before Chriſtmas, when I called on him for it, in perſon, and received it, without the benefit of a ſingle obſervation of his, to accompany its return, However, I ſat down, ſo ſoon after as I could, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the whole into eight articles, which I encloſed to Mr. Samuel Adams, to lay before Congreſs, with two ſheets of paper, containing remarks, and reaſons in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:015447_0094_0F9982D56EAD2C48"/>
of them. Of theſe, together with what I had communicated to the Committee, at my conference with them in June, and to ſeveral of the Members, in my letters to the Preſident and others, I find they have not diſdained to make great uſe, in the arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which have ſince taken place, on a very large ſcale, and eſpecially in what related to the arrangement of the ſuperior officers, and the ſubordination they have traced out in the department.</p>
            <p>I have not mentioned Gen. Green's omiſſion to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what he undertook, from believing it to be volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but as ſome perſons, who having no better reaſon at hand to aſſign for my removal, have, it ſeems, charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, with having promiſed to lay ſome plan before Congreſs, for better regulating the department, and having then neglected it for near three months, during which time, many of the evils complained of, continued without redreſs, I thought it became me to give a true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the cauſe of that delay, ſo far as it reſpected myſelf. I doubt not General Green's being able to give ſuch ſubſtantial reaſons for his delaying to perform his promiſe, as will be fully ſatisfactory: But as that regards him more than myſelf, I leave it to him to ſtate this matter as he pleaſes, if he ſhould chance to think the taking notice of it at all, to be worthy of his attention.</p>

                  <p>BY command of General Waſhington, all the ſick and wounded, both in the General Hoſpital, and thoſe remaining under the care of Regimental Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, are removed within theſe two days, to this ſide the river, and chiefly in this neighbourhood: They amount to ſeveral hundreds, in addition to about 300 who were before removed to Newark, and 4 or 500 in Orange County. I have neither Commiſſary near at hand, nor Quartermaſter, and brought with me only
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:015447_0095_0F9982D5EAA96EB8"/>
three Mates: One Surgeon who was to follow, is hourly expected. The General's commands were to leave a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable body of Surgeons and Mates above Kingſbridge, a general action being daily expected, as the whole force of the enemy is drawn to that quarter. So ſoon as I get this part of the General Hoſpital into order and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, I am to return, and provide accommodations at the White Plains, for which indeed I gave the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary orders before I came over, that in caſe the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication by the North-River ſhould be cut off, for a while, which no doubt the enemy mean to attempt, ſuitable proviſion may be made for the wounded, ſhould there be a general action, which is daily expected. I wrote to Mr. Gerry, giving an account of the ſtate of the hoſpital, ſince the affair of Long-Iſland which I wiſh you to ſee. My anxiety to preſerve hoſpital ſtores occaſioned my removal of the heavy articles to Stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, which I effected, juſt in time to prevent their fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the enemy's hands. Great part of what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained at New-York, were again divided, part to be removed to Kingſbridge, with the Hoſpital Surgeons and Mates, who remained with the army; the reſt to be ſent with the ſick to Newark. In packing and unpack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing medicines, and dealing them out, with other hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſtores, to Regimental Surgeons and Mates, near one half of our mates of the hoſpital have been employed the whole ſummer and autumn, to this time, to the mere ſubverſion, and almoſt total deſtruction, of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Hoſpital. We are now ſcarcely any thing more than collectors and retailers to Regimental Surgeons and Mates; and the ſtores are ſo divided, waſted, and diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated, that without a new arrangement, and abundant more aſſiſtance than we have, or can have, or the hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital continuing fixed in one place, we ſhall ſhortly be incapable of yielding any aſſiſtance at all. The greateſt difficulty is the ſupplying medicines to the whole army. Think how I came to have that charge, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Whilſt matters were under conſideration, Boſton was evacuated by the Britiſh troops: By dint of unwearied aſſiduity, I collected a great number of blankets, beds and rugs, which had been left, by the Britiſh army, in hoſpitals, barracks, and in the river: I had them waſhed, and made fit for uſe By the General's Orders I took poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of a large Druggiſt's ſhop, and a ſmall one of a private practitioner, after they were gleaned of capital articles, as camphor, rhubarb, bark, opium. &amp;c. The General concluding it would be a means of ſupplying the regiments, as well as General Hoſpital, ordered me to purchaſe ſuch articles as were wanted, and as I could get, and make out cheſts for every regiment, in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my which he commanded: This made it late before I could get to New-York, and above half the mates were employed, in packing and accompanying the medicines to New-York. Hearing, on my arrival, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs had a large aſſortment of medicines at Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, and being called upon by the ſurgeons, in the nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern department, to ſupply them, I haſtened to Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia to confer with a Committee of Congreſs, and have my duty better aſcertained: I found that of a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable aſſortment of capital articles, which the Congreſs had purchaſed, there had been conſiderable deductionſ
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:015447_0096_0F9982D6B1252570"/>
for the uſe of the ſouthern army, and part ſold, as if the quantity was greater than was required for public uſe: On which I repreſented to the Committee the neceſſity of huſbanding the ſtock well. I begged that a ſhare might be appropriated for the uſe of the army under General Waſhington, and undertook to furniſh for the preſent campaign, the regiments of that army, with cheſts for the campaign, not imagining they would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the number of 40 regiments, eſpecially as the Flying Camp was to form a ſeparate department; and was fearful leſt, if regiments were unequally ſerved, great part of the Surgeons would be deſtitute and uſeleſs. To make out the better, I bought up all the valuable articles I could meet with at New-York, and elſewhere: Beſides 5 regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which I ſupplyed with cheſts at Boſton, and 20 to the northward, I ſupplyed, from the beginning of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the middle of Auguſt, above 40 cheſts. Then freſh demands came from hoſts of militia, the numbers countleſs, who joined the army, deſtitute of every thing neceſſary for ſick and wounded, as inſtruments, ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages, or medicines: They demanded even their provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as well as medicines, from me, and our whole force of Surgeons and Mates were chiefly employed to furniſh the Regimental Surgeons: The labour was too great, the taſk beyond our abilities, for medicines became more ſcarce every day, and our ſtores diſſipated. The mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proviſion, to ſave part of our ſtores, before the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of Long-Iſland, and the confuſion in which we have been ever ſince, moving about by detachment; the ſick ſcattered, under the care of Regimental Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, for a tract of 30 miles and upwards; only one apothecary being allowed; no leiſure for either him or me to leave the army, and look out for ſupplies; and none to be got for writing, or next to none; the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed requiring our care; deſtitute of help from Quarter-maſters and Commiſſaries, when removed to a diſtance. All concur to ſhew that the reſolve of Congreſs, that the Directors ſhall ſupply medicines to the Regimental
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:015447_0097_0F9982ECD3C38648"/>
Surgeons, is a thing impoſſible, at leaſt in my depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for any length of time, unleſs I am allowed to leave the camp, and range through the different States, or rather to employ a variety of perſons for that purpoſe. I have repreſented the matter to the General, and now hope the Congreſs will take it into conſideration. I have been reduced to the neceſſity of ſending a ſurgeon to proceed through New-England, to collect medicines, as Doctor Stringer is gone in perſon, for his depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I have wrote to Governor Trumbull and the Aſſembly of Connecticut, for their aſſiſtance; to the State of New-York for help; ſent for and iſſued out all my own ſtock of medicines; purchaſed from public bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and private practitioners; wrote to Mr. Baſs, Mr. Smith and others: All is inſufficient. I ſhall make out another liſt, and ſend to Mr. Smith; but I fear much that I ſhall not get what I want, in Philadelphia: It is diſtreſſing to the laſt degree, to be harraſſed with ſuch unceaſing clamorous demands, for what I neither have, nor can get; and if I had them, I have not help ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to iſſue them out, it being as much as two or three perſons can do to prepare, and iſſue out medicines for the ſick in the General Hoſpital, diffuſed as ours is, and neceſſarily ſo.</p>
                  <p>General Waſhington has ordered me to draw up a plan for the government of the General Hoſpital, and of the Regimental Surgeons, ſuch as I think practicable in the execution, and beſt calculated to anſwer the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of both: I preſented him with a rough ſketch, which he has examined, and made his remarks: Lord Sterling has done the ſame; and it is now in the hands of General M'Dougall; and it is to paſs through General Green's, then to undergo corrections and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendments, to lay before the Congreſs, for which this may prepare you.</p>
                  <p>This minute I learn, that the Britiſh troops have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from Frog's-Point; are landed at New Rochell;
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:015447_0097_0F9982ECD3C38648"/>
a general action is hourly expected; an important event, on which much depends.</p>
                  <p>The deſign of this letter is, principally, to prepare the attention of Congreſs to the affairs of my department. We want rags, old linnen, bandages, lint, tow, thread, needles and pins, &amp;c. They are not to be got here. Would it not be worth the attention of a Committee of Congreſs, or ſome active Members, to ſet ſome inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the city to collect theſe, and other neceſſary articles, and ſend off with diſpatch. They cannot come too ſoon, or in larger quantity than ſufficient. The hoſpital has been drained by ſupplying Regimental Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons. We muſt depend on the public to furniſh freſh ſupplies: They are not to be got here: I am over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with buſineſs; I cannot leave the hoſpital to go in ſearch of them. <hi>I now give notice of my difficulties, while I can, in time, that in caſe of falling ſhort of the quantity of thoſe neceſſaries, I may not be blamed for the impoſſibility of collecting them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall incloſe you a liſt of medicines wanted for ſuch an army as General Waſhington's, which I conceive to be rather moderate than extravagant. Without ſo ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital a ſtock is provided in time, we ſhall be unfurniſhed for another campaign: Nor do I think it ſufficient for more than ſix ſuch months as the laſt. Judge then whether it will not be neceſſary to employ Commiſſaries to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe medicines; to prepare them before they come to the army; to provide a place of ſafety, at a proper diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from danger, and not ſubject to continual move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; to have an Apothecary for the army or regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, diſtinct from the Hoſpital Apothecary, and mates and labourers to aſſiſt in iſſuing them out, when wanted, to the reſpective Surgeons.

<pb n="148" facs="unknown:015447_0098_0F9982D7CDE8BAE0"/>
ſome relief. There are few, perhaps, but readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that this notice of my difficulties produced im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate and powerful aſſiſtance; or, that the Congreſs did me ample juſtice, in exculpating me from all cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and blame for want of it. Quite the contrary of all this is the fact. No more notice was taken of this information, that ever came to my knowledge, than if it were a tale of what happened in ages paſt, that did no ways concern ourſelves.</p>
            <p>When the remnant of the army that retreated from Brunſwick had croſſed the Delaware, I proceeded to Philadelphia, to wait on Congreſs, and to lay matters before them in perſon, for ſuch regulations for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter care of the ſick and wounded, as were ſuitable to the occaſion, and to obtain an explanation and amendment of the reſolves of Congreſs, October 9th. I met Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor Ruſh in the ſtreet, and attempted, for a moment, to detain him, till I could acquaint him with the preſent circumſtances, and ſituation of affairs: He gave me no time: All he ſaid was, that "he was glad I was come; it would take a great burden from his ſhoulders," and paſſed on. When I afterwards called upon him, at his houſe, to repreſent matters to him there, as a Member of the Medical Committee, for relief; the ſum of his anſwer was, that "he would not, for ten times the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, go through the amazing toils and difficulties of my ſtation." But inſtead of relief from the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and hardſhip of my ſituation, all the returns I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from Congreſs, are complaints diſregarded, griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances unredreſſed, and, without an hearing, and without aſſigning a reaſon, a diſmiſſion from my ſtation, as if Congreſs intended to fix a ſtigma on my character. But however hidden the motives for ſuch conduct are, a day may come, when theſe will be fully underſtood.</p>
            <p>The ſame Gentleman who then felt, or ſeemed to feel for my ſituation, having ſince accepted a place, near of kin to that which he then ſo earneſtly deprecated, may perhaps remember it. I can truly ſay, ſhould he aſpire
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:015447_0098_0F9982D7CDE8BAE0"/>
to, or hereafter enjoy, that very place, I do not wiſh him the ill-treatment and ingratitude for his ſervices in it, which I have experienced.</p>
            <p>TO SHEW how difficult it was for me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any exact information from Congreſs, on ſuch particulars as I conceived it neceſſary to know, I need only acquaint the reader with the following particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p>Being applyed to by Doctor Potts, who acted in the character of Director in a ſeparate branch of the nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern department, to ſend him proper perſons, to aſſiſt him, otherwiſe it would not be in his power to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the truſt repoſed in him, I nominated two gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen for that purpoſe, in the quality of a Surgeon, and Apothecary to that part of the hoſpital.</p>
            <p>As other demands of that fort might be made upon me, I wrote to Mr. Charles Thomſon, Secretary, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting him to acquaint me, from the Journals of the Congreſs, whether the nomination of Surgeons to fill up vacancies, in any part of the General Hoſpital of the northern department, reſted with me as Director-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and Phyſician in Chief of the American Hoſpital. It appeared, that Doctor Stringer had been impowered to take charge of the northern department, the nature of which I did not fully underſtand: But I thought the reſolves of July 17, laſt, warranted me to call upon him, as one of the Directors, for returns of ſurgeons, mates, and other officers, &amp;c. but then he had wrote word to me, that he conceived himſelf to be a ſenior of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, and upon a ſuppoſition of our ever coming toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, expected precedence, from that priority, or to take rank of me; and had given me to underſtand in expreſs terms, that he never would be accountable to me, or to any perſon, but the Commander of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular department where he was, or to the Commander in Chief: And referred me to the votes of Congreſs, September 14, for the particulars of his appointment.
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:015447_0099_0F9982D821EEB8C8"/>
Having no acceſs to thoſe votes otherwiſe, I informed the Secretary, in the letter which I wrote him, of my deſire to avoid interfering with Doctor Stringer, in his department, from any miſconception of the intentions of Congreſs; and aſked as a favour, that he would be pleaſed to let me have a copy of the votes, relative to Doctor Stringer's appointment and inſtructions, and to Doctor Shippen's appointment and inſtructions, that I might know whether it was the duty of thoſe Gentlemen to make me the ſpecified returns of July 17th, or not.</p>
            <p>Did he comply with my requeſt? O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He ſent them not, but in place thereof, in a poſitive ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſterial way, gave me to underſtand, (in which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he was greatly miſtaken) that "<hi>undoubtedly,</hi> at the appointment of thoſe Gentlemen, they had the ſame powers given to them, <hi>in all reſpects,</hi> of nominating their own ſurgeons, nurſes, &amp;c. in their departments, as I had myſelf in mine; and as to rank and prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and all that nonſenſe (as he called it) there was nothing in the Journals to eſtabliſh it."</p>
            <p>By this time, I had obtained from Doctor Stringer himſelf a copy of his appointment, and of the powers veſted in him by Congreſs, Sept. 14, 1775 (ſee page 27) which enabled me to point out his miſtake, by ſhewing him that Doctor Stringer had no power given him, by thoſe reſolves, of nominating a ſingle ſurgeon, or any officers whatever, except a number of mates, not to exceed four; a power not equal to that given to any of the ſurgeons, appointed by me, as each of them had a power of nominating five mates; and having taken the liberty to tell this GREATMAN! that in what it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned me to be well acquainted with, for the direction of my conduct, I preferred a ſtate of facts to his gloſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, on which I could form a judgment of my own, on the evidence they afforded; and that had he been

pleaſed to have examined theſe reſolves of Congreſs, his diſobliging obſervations on rank and precedence, might have been ſpared; I further told him, that men bred up in the army, had different notions from what he ſeemed to entertain, and that ſuppoſing their rank and their pay were to come into competition with each other, every officer of ſpirit and honour, would rather ſacrifice his pay, as of leſs conſequence, than his rank; and then aſked him, if it was a matter of no impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, how it came to paſs that the Congreſs, in their late reſolves, had determined that the ſurgeons and mates of the hoſpital ſhould take rank of regimental ſurgeons and mates.</p>
            <p>His letter, in reply to this, contained in it ſeveral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions ſo rude, and impertinent to the matter in hand, that I chuſe to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

            <p>Theſe abſtracts ſet forth, that on being called upon for the purpoſe, and conſidering themſelves in honour obliged to certify facts of which they are acquainted, reſpecting the conduct and management of JOHN MORGAN, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> late Director-General of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Hoſpital, and Phyſician in Chief, from being officers in ſaid hoſpital, and therefore falling under their cognizance.</p>

            <p>THE above abſtracts are taken from certificates ſigned by John Warren, Philip Turner, and William Euſtis, Eſquires, Surgeons of the General Hoſpital, and Iſaac Ledyard, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Apothecary to the General Hoſpital, in the Eaſtern Department. Doctor Foſter was generally detached, and at a diſtance. I have never ſeen Doctors Adams, M'Knight, or Burnet, ſince my diſmiſſion, to converſe with them on the ſubject; but have no doubt of meeting with equal readineſs in them, to teſtify to the ſame faithful diſcharge of my duty, with the other Gentlemen, whenever they are called upon for that purpoſe.

            <p>It may not be improper to ſay a few words, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gentlemen who have acted immediately under me; one of whom is raiſed to the rank of Deputy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector General: None of them, that I know of, have done diſcredit to their places.</p>
            <p>However Congreſs may reconcile it to themſelves, and to the juſtice that is ſuppoſed to be due to Gentlemen of unexceptionable characters, that have ſerved them faithfully, and with approved ability, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the war; and have deſerved well at their hands, for what they have done and ſuffered, from being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly engaged as Surgeons in the General Hoſpital,
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:015447_0101_0F9982DC2338C110"/>
ſince its firſt eſtabliſhment; to paſs them by, and to place over their heads ſome who were never before in the ſervice, and others who were their juniors; they have, however unintentionally, done great honour to my appointments. Of three Gentlemen whom I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated, and who have ſerved under me, as Surgeons, who are all I ever appointed, and were the youngeſt in the hoſpitals of my department, two of them are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted, by Congreſs, to the ſtations of Phyſician Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and Surgeon General, in the Army. Can a ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger proof be given of the care and fidelity with which I exerciſed that truſt, than in employing, as officers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me, Gentlemen whom the Congreſs itſelf has ſeen fit, ſince, to diſtinguiſh in ſo extraordinary a manner? And when one of the beforementioned Gentlemen, who had juſt reaſon to expect to be noticed amongſt the firſt appointments in the department, was for ſome time, at leaſt, wholly overlooked, by them, as he was to my knowledge, probably, becauſe he could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to be troubling Congreſs, either by himſelf or friends, with ſolicitations in his behalf, though they were not ignorant of his ſervices; and though brother to HIM, who laid down his life in their CAUSE, and whoſe memory is held ſacred by them; but who, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deriving merit from any extrinſic or adventitious circumſtances, has conducted himſelf in a manner that reflects honour upon his talents and humanity!</p>
            <p>If Congreſs could be capable then, of ſo long neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the known, but modeſt worth of Doctor JOHN WARREN, the world may leſs wonder they ſhould ſo eaſily get over the obligations they owed to myſelf, and to their own reputation.</p>
            <p>As to the Mates, many of them are raiſed to the rank of Surgeons of Regiments, and I doubt not, that by their ſuperior knowledge in the duties of their ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, above what many of their predeceſſors enjoyed, they will reflect credit on the General Hoſpital, under my direction, as a School to qualify them for ſuperior ſervices.</p>

As to myſelf, and the unworthy treatment I have met with; I call it unworthy, for ſo it is, in reſpect to me, however worthy it may be of the authors of it; whatever credit and growing fame ſome may imagine they have acquired by it, I conſider it not as any diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to me, but to thoſe only who have procured it. Time, the great revealer of Mens motives as well as actions, will perhaps, one day, un maſk the private and diſguiſed deſigns of men, who cover them at preſent, with a pretext of public good, but which are viſible by their actions to the quicker ſight of diſcerning men, who judge of a tree, not by its appearances, but its fruits. I do not envy them, but rather wonder, and wiſh them to enjoy the juſt reward of their devices.</p>

            <p>I doubt not, but they will fail, however, in one part of their deſign, and by endeavouring to throw an odium on my character, fix an indeliable mark on their own; and, perhaps, find that injuſtice ſo ſweet to their taſte, may, before it is digeſted, bring forth gaul and bitterneſs, and what they have ſowed in deceit and folly, they may reap in remorſe and diſappointment.</p>
            <p>Leaving them, therefore, to the opinion which the juſter and wiſer part of mankind may have of them in this proceeding, and to the operation of that inward monitor in their own breaſts, I am ſatisfied in having hung out lights to thoſe embarked in the ſame bottom with deſigning men, who ſteering amidſt rocks and quick-ſands, "hold themſelves in readineſs to plunder the veſſel they mean to wreck."</p>
            <p>I have endeavoured to diſcharge my duty in what I undertook from principle, according to my degree of knowledge and capacity, with faithfulneſs and diligence; and what I value more than knowledge or capacity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, with humanity; from whence reſults the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a good conſcience, which as my enemies, with
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:015447_0102_0F9982DDE8B19270"/>
all their power, cannot give, ſo neither can they take away. Why then ſhould I repine at the portion of difficulties, that, in times like theſe, have fallen to my lot, and which I have neither coveted, nor been able to ſhun? Having been born in freedom, I claim it, in common with every other freeman, as an indiſputable, unalienable right, which I have never ſurrendered to any one, to defend my good name from the attacks of inſidious men, of whatever claſs or denomination. Be it ever, therefore, my part to declare, without fear and without reſerve, that true Freedom is my "unconquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble delight," and that I am equally a foe to falſe preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of liberty, and "to every ſpecies of bondage," but moſt to "that of the mind."</p>
            <p>As to thoſe who have made themſelves buſy to reflect on my character, I conſider their envy to be rather a proof of merit, than dread the power of their malice to affect me, ſince, in every age,
<q>
