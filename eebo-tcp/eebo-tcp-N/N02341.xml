         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ATTESTATION, From the very Reverend Dr. <hi>Increaſe Mather.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THAT the Churches of NEW-ENG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND have been originally of the CONGREGATIONAL Perſwaſion and Profeſſion, is known to every one. Their <hi>Platform</hi> does expreſly diſlike and diſclaim the Name of INDEPENDENT. The Reaſon why that Name has been impoſed upon them, was, Becauſe they maintained, that a <hi>Particular,</hi> and <hi>Organiſed</hi> Church, has <hi>entire Power</hi> within it ſelf, to manage the Affairs of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of CHRIST, and the holy <hi>Diſcipline</hi> belonging to it, without a <hi>Dependence</hi> on any ſuperiour Power on Earth. They Revere <hi>Synods,</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Councils,</hi> conſiſting of <hi>Elders,</hi> and <hi>Brethren,</hi> ſent as Meſſengers of the Churches, when want of <hi>Peace</hi> or <hi>Light,</hi> ſhall call for their Advice; but they
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:002775_0003_0FE63005CC97FBD8"/>Eſteem not <hi>ſtated Councils,</hi> or <hi>Synods,</hi> with a <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridical Power</hi> to be of Divine Inſtitution.</p>
            <p>What the Arguments were, which did ſatisfy them, that the <hi>Congregational Way</hi> is the <hi>way of Truth;</hi> 'Tis to be ſeen in the Books Publiſhed by thoſe eminent Servants of CHRIST, who firſt ſettled Churches, in theſe Parts of the World; eſpecially ſuch as Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi>'s Treatiſe of, <hi>The Keys.</hi> There is a Book under the Name of that Great Man, called, <hi>The Way of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> which was publiſhed by a <hi>Browniſtical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,</hi> without Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi>'s Conſent or Knowledge. But in a Diſcourſe after that was publiſhed, he refers the Reader, who deſires to know his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about <hi>Church Diſcipline,</hi> unto his Book of, <hi>The Keys,</hi> and not that of, <hi>The Way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another of the moſt eminent Divines that ever <hi>New-England</hi> ſaw, was Mr. <hi>Thomas Hooker,</hi> Paſtor of the Church in <hi>Hartford. The Survey of Church Diſcipline,</hi> drawn by him, is a moſt Acute, Accurate, Logical Compoſure; ſome look upon it as Irrefragable, Unanſwerable. It had the Approbation of all the Miniſters, that were then in that and the next Colony.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> alſo in his learned Anſwer in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin to the Enquiries of <hi>Apoll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nius</hi> (a Dutch Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine) argues clearly and ſtrenuouſly, in Defence of the <hi>Congregational Church Diſcipline:</hi> A Book whereof Dr. <hi>Hornbeck,</hi> the famous Profeſſor in <hi>Leyden,</hi> expreſſed a ſingular Eſteem.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iii" facs="unknown:002775_0004_0FE63005D187ABC0"/>
I might have mentioned, what my Father has written, for the Defence of theſe Churches, in Anſwer to two famous Divines, Mr. <hi>Charles Herle,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Samuel Rutherford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, that for certain <hi>Modalities,</hi> there has been a <hi>Variety</hi> of Practice, in theſe Churches; as there was in the Primitive; But in <hi>Eſſentials,</hi> both of Doctrine, and of Diſcipline, they agree. The <hi>Eccentric</hi> are but few; nor are there ſo many late <hi>Innovations,</hi> as to deſerve any notice to be taken of them.</p>
            <p>We look upon <hi>Reforming Presbyterians,</hi> as our dear Brethren: Among whom we have in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular a moſt brotherly Affection, for thoſe in <hi>Scotland.</hi> When any come from thence, furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Teſtimonies of their <hi>Good Converſation in CHRIST,</hi> they are as welcome to our Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as any Members of our own Churches. When the Perſons of Both Perſwaſions in <hi>London</hi> became <hi>united Brethren,</hi> the Tidings thereof were highly acceptable to the Churches of <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in which they are ever ſo.</p>
            <p>In the Title Page of our, <hi>Platform of Diſcipline,</hi> which was agreed by the <hi>Elders,</hi> and <hi>Meſſengers</hi> of the Churches in the <hi>Synod</hi> at <hi>Cambridge;</hi> 1648. it is ſaid to be, <hi>Gathered out of the Word of GOD.</hi> It appears by the <hi>Hiſtorical Relation</hi> here faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given of what is <hi>Practiſed</hi> in the Churches ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that <hi>Platform,</hi> that it agrees as with the <hi>Apoſtolical Time,</hi> ſo with the <hi>Practiſes</hi> of the Chriſtians in the Age next unto the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:002775_0005_0FE630079CC8BE70"/>except in ſome <hi>Superſtitions,</hi> which the Churches of <hi>New-England</hi> never had among them.</p>
            <p>The Churches here, were Planted <hi>a noble Vine.</hi> Indeed it was not with reſpect to the <hi>Fundamentals</hi> in <hi>Doctrine,</hi> that our Fathers came into this Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs. For they agree to the <hi>Doctrinal Articles</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> (as fully as any, and more fully than many,) of the <hi>Conformiſts</hi> in that Church. But it was with Regard unto <hi>Church Order</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> that our pious Anceſtors the <hi>Good old Puritan Nonconformiſts,</hi> tranſported them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Families, over the vaſt Ocean to theſe goings down of the Sun. On which Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, a Degeneracy from the Principles of pure <hi>Scriptural Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> in the Church, would be more Evil in the Children of <hi>New-England,</hi> than any other People in the World.</p>
            <p>May what is here performed, (with an <hi>Erudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as well as a <hi>Fidelity,</hi> which I hope, will Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the Work,) be bleſſed for their <hi>Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Eſtabliſhment</hi> in the <hi>Good old Way,</hi> in which their Fathers have walked; The Writer of this <hi>Ratio Diſciplinae</hi> will then have cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in this his Labour.</p>

            <p>¶. For the PRINCIPLES of theſe <hi>Churches;</hi> they are declared in their, PLATFORM OF CHURCH DISCIPLINE; which has been ſo often publiſhed, and is in ſo many Hands, that there is no need of giving here a New <hi>Edition,</hi> or indeed any <hi>Abridgement</hi> of it. And there is the leſs need of ſuch a Repetition, becauſe their <hi>Principles</hi> will be all along ſufficiently diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002775_0012_0FE630121A17B7D0"/>by their <hi>Proceedings,</hi> and the <hi>Methods</hi> and <hi>Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms</hi> obtaining among them, which are now go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be related. Let this only be here obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and ſtill Remembred; Thoſe Reverend Perſons of the <hi>Presbyterian Way,</hi> who publiſhed their <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> ſo many Years ago, do expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, <hi>That they agreed with the Things of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Concernment in it; and that thoſe things wherein they differed from it, were of leſſer Conſequence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of their Debates were not</hi> Contentiones <hi>but</hi> Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Beſides,</hi> and indeed, <hi>Before,</hi> the <hi>Platform,</hi> there were ſeveral <hi>Treatiſes</hi> long ago publiſhed, wherein the <hi>Principles</hi> of theſe CHURCHES, were, as with Loud ſounding Trumpets, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed unto the World.</p>
            <p>One of them was, the famous COTTON's Book of, <hi>The Keys;</hi> Which the celebrated <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therford</hi> approv'd, as being <hi>ſound</hi> in every thing; except (as <hi>he</hi> thought) that of not giving <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> quite enough to <hi>Synods.</hi> The Memorable <hi>Owen,</hi> attempting to write an Anſwer to that Book, was inſtead of <hi>Confuting</hi> it, ſo <hi>Conquered</hi> by it, that he came entirely into the Sentiments of it; and ſo liv'd, and ſo held, and ſo wrote, all the reſt of his Days.</p>
            <p>Another of them was, the <hi>Reſponſio</hi> to a <hi>Sylloge Quaeſtionum</hi> ſent hither from <hi>Zeland;</hi> which Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer was written in <hi>Latin</hi> by the famous NOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, at the <hi>Unanimous Deſire and Order</hi> of the Miniſters then ſhining in the Country. What
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002775_0013_0FE6301782B515B0"/>Satisfaction it gave, may be gathered, from the Atteſtations of Dr. <hi>Goodwyn,</hi> Mr. <hi>Nye,</hi> Mr. <hi>Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> unto it; Yea, and from the Reſpectful men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with which Dr. <hi>Hornbeck</hi> magnifies the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> and <hi>Candour</hi> of the Author, even in thoſe Points, wherein he diſſents from him. Dr. <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> alſo in his <hi>Church-Hiſtory</hi> has theſe Words up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; <hi>Of all the Authors I have peruſed concerning theſe Opinions, none to me was more Informative, than</hi> Mr. John Norton, <hi>One of no leſs Learning, than Modeſty, in his Anſwer to</hi> Apollonius, <hi>Paſtor of the Church in</hi> Middleburgh.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Church-State</hi> of <hi>New England,</hi> even in theſe Exhibitions of it, is, <hi>by reaſon of Strength</hi> now come to more than <hi>Fourſcore Years;</hi> But the <hi>Strength</hi> holds; it is to be hoped, that it will not be <hi>ſoon cut off;</hi> or indeed ever <hi>fly away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some have, ſuddenly enough, pronounced the Churches of <hi>New-England,</hi> as too little <hi>agreed</hi> among themſelves in the Affairs of their <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Policy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But certainly, there is a <hi>General Agreement</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them in theſe Articles.</p>
            <p>Firſt. A People reſolving to adhere unto the Maxims of the <hi>Everlaſting Goſpel,</hi> and live unto GOD according to all the Rules of Inconteſtible PIETY, and appearing in a competent and a convenient <hi>Number,</hi> to form an <hi>Aſſembly</hi> for the Worſhip of GOD our SAVIOUR, in all His Inſtitutions, may <hi>Aſſociate</hi> for that Purpoſe;
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002775_0014_0FE63017870B1DA8"/>and (if their Aſſembling will be no evident Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice unto the <hi>Kingdom of GOD,</hi> and <hi>Welfare of Men,</hi> in <hi>Societies</hi> already formed for that Purpoſe, whereof they ought to be the Members,) they have a <hi>Right</hi> ſo to do.</p>
            <p>Secondly. A Body of ſuch People, ſo <hi>Aſſociat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> are an <hi>Inſtituted Church,</hi> and have all the <hi>Rights</hi> of a <hi>particular Church</hi> belonging unto them; A <hi>Spiritual Corporation,</hi> which has Power to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the <hi>Appointments</hi> of our SAVIOUR, and <hi>Elect</hi> what <hi>Officers</hi> He has appointed for them, and <hi>Cenſure</hi> ſuch <hi>Offenders</hi> as may prove <hi>Roots of Bitterneſs</hi> unto them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly. The <hi>Paſtors</hi> that ſuch a Church has choſen to <hi>Watch for their Souls,</hi> qualified for their Work, and Accepting the Charge, have a <hi>Power</hi> to manage the <hi>Public Sacrifices</hi> of the Goſpel in their Flocks, and particularly to adminiſter the <hi>Sacraments</hi> of the New Teſtament unto the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Subjects of them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly. Every <hi>Church</hi> thus <hi>formed as a People for the Praiſe of GOD,</hi> ought, in Things of <hi>common Coneern,</hi> which will affect the <hi>Tranquillity,</hi> or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the <hi>Acknowledgement,</hi> of <hi>other Churches,</hi> bound up in the <hi>Faith and Order of the Goſpel</hi> with them, to pay a great Regard unto their <hi>Advice,</hi> and ask for it on recurring Occaſions.</p>
            <p>Fifthly. The <hi>Sacred Scriptures</hi> are the <hi>ſufficient Rule</hi> for <hi>Belief,</hi> and <hi>Worſhip,</hi> and <hi>Manners,</hi> among the People of GOD; And a <hi>Brotherly Fellowſhip</hi> is
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002775_0015_0FE6301D7B90BBC8"/>to be maintained with <hi>all Good Men,</hi> in the Things wherein we apprehend them to follow theſe <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Directions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the ſame time they are for extending <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence</hi> further than they can <hi>Communion,</hi> and are for an <hi>Indulgence</hi> of <hi>Civil Rights</hi> in the <hi>State</hi> unto all that approve themſelves Faithful <hi>Subjects,</hi> and Honeſt <hi>Neighbours,</hi> and ſuch Inoffenſive Livers, that <hi>Humane Society</hi> cannot complain of Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance from them</p>
            <p>True ELEUTHERIANS will conſider, how far any <hi>further Agreement</hi> may be Neceſſary: And whether thoſe unreaſonable Sons of <hi>Procruſtes,</hi> the Narrow-ſoul'd and Imperious Bigots for <hi>Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,</hi> will do <hi>Religion</hi> any real Service, by the preſſing of it.</p>
            <p>Behold, The <hi>Puritaniſmus Novanglicanus!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>¶. Such a <hi>Foundation</hi> being laid, the <hi>Superſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> is now waited for. It will be ſeen in the PRACTICES of the <hi>Churches,</hi> which are now going to be related.</p>
            <p>[Let it be remembred; The <hi>Indians</hi> in the <hi>Maſſachuſet</hi> Province, are all <hi>Chriſtianized;</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Eaſtern Salvages, which have been <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtianized</hi> by the Popiſh Miſſionaries.

<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002775_0017_0FE6301F42B4FA58"/>Advantage to have a <hi>New Church</hi> formed in the Neighbourhood, firſt ſettle their <hi>Number,</hi> and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure themſelves that their Number is <hi>Competent</hi> and <hi>Reſolved</hi> for the Undertaking.</p>
               <p>The Jews of old held, <hi>That leſs than Ten</hi> Men of Leiſure, <hi>could not make a Congregation.</hi> 'Tis perhaps in Oppoſition to this Tradition, that our Saviour ſaid, Matth. XVIII. 20. <hi>Where two or three are gathered together in my Name, there am I in the midſt of them.</hi> And hence <hi>Tertullian</hi> encourageth himſelf to ſay, <hi>Ubi tres, Eccleſia eſt, licet Laici.</hi> Nevertheleſs, becauſe it has been apprehended, that a Rule of <hi>Church-Diſcipline</hi> in the <hi>Eighteenth</hi> Chapter of <hi>Matthew,</hi> cannot be well reduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Practice, by any Number under <hi>Seven,</hi> and for more Reaſons that might be rendred, <hi>Seven</hi> is the leaſt Number that has been allowed among us, as capable to form a <hi>Church State</hi> for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of all <hi>ſpecial Ordinances;</hi> But uſually there is a larger Number expected.</p>
               <p>§. 2. The MEN who by mutual Conferences with one another, are come to a good Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Reſolution for the <hi>Gathering of a Church,</hi> are uſually ſuch as are already the <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> of other Churches; and obtain an Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from the ſaid Churches, for them to bear a part in this Action; which Allowance is uſually ſignified in a <hi>Written Inſtrument</hi> If any of them are not ſo, they give to theſe Brethren ſuch an Account of their Qualifications for the Work now before them, and they are ſo ſatisfied in their <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Behaviour,</hi> that they admit them into their Number.</p>

§. 3. In <hi>former Times,</hi> a Church of Brethren has been ſometimes <hi>Gathered,</hi> without any One in their Number yet Elected or Expected by them, for their <hi>Paſtor.</hi> And the <hi>Gathering of a Church</hi> has been the ſole Work of the Day, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>Ordination</hi> of a <hi>Paſtor.</hi> The Work has been carried on with admirable Solemnity, and left an Everlaſting Impreſſion on the Multitude of Spectators: A Work full of <hi>Hol Glory.</hi> But in <hi>later Times,</hi> a <hi>Church</hi> is rarely Gathered, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>Candidate of the Miniſtry,</hi> being one of the Number for the intended Coalition; who has been for ſome while a <hi>Preacher</hi> unto them; And on the Day of their <hi>Gathering,</hi> his <hi>Ordination</hi> is alſo ſolemnized.</p>
               <p>§. 4. The Perſons who are engaging and combining for the weighty Undertaking of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering a Church,</hi> ſet a part a Day to be ſpent by them together in <hi>Prayer with Faſting,</hi> that they may prepare for what is before them, and confeſs their Dependence on Heaven for Favours which they own themſelves unworthy of, and obtain the Bleſſing of GOD; [On which Day, they privately together <hi>Sign</hi> their <hi>Covenant.</hi>] Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more than one ſuch Day; Sometimes in a <hi>Public Aſſembly,</hi> where the Neighbouring Paſtors come to inſtruct and aſſiſt them. They think it proper to make a very <hi>Great Preparation</hi> for an Undertaking the moſt Holy, and Awful, and Heavenly, that can be on this ſide Heaven engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in.</p>
               <p>§. 5. In time convenient the <hi>Good Men of this Intention,</hi> (who from firſt to laſt, privately wait upon <hi>Paſtors</hi> in the Neighbourhood for their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection)
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002775_0019_0FE630261E18AA88"/>ſend <hi>Letters</hi> unto the Paſtors and Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Neighbouring Towns, (what number they Judge convenient) wherein they report what they intend, on a Day therein ſpecified; and requeſt that the <hi>Paſtors</hi> with other <hi>Meſſengers</hi> or <hi>Delegates</hi> of the ſaid Churches will pleaſe then to Countenance their Proceedings, at the Place alſo ſpecified. The <hi>Paſtors</hi> Read theſe <hi>Letters,</hi> to their <hi>Churches,</hi> and the <hi>Delegates</hi> or <hi>Meſſengers</hi> to accompany them, unto this Tranſaction (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Nomination of the <hi>Paſtors,</hi> with <hi>Liberty</hi> then allowed for the <hi>Brethren,</hi> to nominate any more if they ſee Cauſe) are by ſome <hi>Vote</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and appointed for it.</p>
               <p>§. 6. The <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Meſſengers</hi> from the Churches of the Vicinity, convening at the Time and Place aſſigned, and chuſing their <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator,</hi> the Candidates of the <hi>New Church</hi> appear before them, and preſent unto them a, <hi>Confeſſion of their Faith,</hi> and therewithal the <hi>Covenant</hi> or <hi>Engagement,</hi> in which they recognize their Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, to <hi>ſerve</hi> the Great GOD their Saviour, and to <hi>walk</hi> with one another, in the <hi>Faith and Order of the Goſpel.</hi> They produce alſo the <hi>Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monials</hi> of the Allowance which the Churches whereto they formerly belonged, have given them to Transfer their more immediate Relation unto the Society now to be gathered.

                  <hi>Ordaining</hi> the <hi>Paſtor</hi> of the Church. But many Good Men rather chuſe and wiſh, that this <hi>great Action,</hi> may be done in as <hi>publick</hi> a Manner as may be; For 'tis indeed one of the greateſt Things that can be done among the Children of Men; 'Tis a Glorious Homage paid unto the <hi>Son of GOD,</hi> and a Teſtimony born to His Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; 'Tis rarely performed when in the Hands of a wiſe <hi>Moderator,</hi> without <hi>Floods of Tears</hi> in the affected Spectators, and laſting <hi>Impreſſions of Piety</hi> upon them.</p>
               <p>§. 10. The CHURCH-COVENANT thus uſed in the Churches of <hi>New-England,</hi> is by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent and Conſiderate Perſons, looked upon as no other than the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly applied unto the <hi>Duties</hi> and <hi>Concerns</hi> of <hi>particular Churches. Particular Churches</hi> are in their Apprehenſion an <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of our Lord Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and there are <hi>particular Duties,</hi> which the Members of theſe Churches owe unto their <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and unto one another. The <hi>Church-Covenant</hi> is but an <hi>Acknowledgement</hi> of the Obligations to <hi>theſe Duties</hi> lying on the Members of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. No Body denies that GOD commands Men to <hi>acknowledge</hi> their Obligations to the <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of their ſeveral Relations: But then it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears very plain, that the more <hi>explicit</hi> they are in ſuch a Tranſaction, on ſuch an Occaſion as that of <hi>Gathering a Church,</hi> 'tis the <hi>Better</hi> on all Accounts; And the <hi>Great King whoſe Name is Venerable,</hi> is always to be ſerved with <hi>our Beſt.</hi> It is an Ancient Maxim not peculiar to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the <hi>Congregational</hi> Way, <hi>Foederata Conjunctio conſtituit Eccleſiam.</hi> And indeed, it ſeems beyond
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002775_0026_0FE6302EE15C3110"/>all Contradiction, That where Men do not, <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly</hi> at leaſt, Agree, and Engage to Worſhip our Saviour together, according to His Laws, they cannot be eſteemed, a <hi>Church.</hi> But then, if an <hi>Implicit Covenant</hi> be of ſuch Importance to the Being of a <hi>Particular Church,</hi> 'tis argued, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an <hi>Explicit Covenant</hi> is Expedient, Profitable, Deſireable. Without ſomething of this Nature, 'tis asked, How can there be ſuch a <hi>Joining</hi> and <hi>Cleaving</hi> together, as there was Exemplified for Chriſtian Churches, in that which was the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them all!</hi> Acts II. 42.</p>
               <p>Antiquity is no Stranger to this Notion. 'Tis <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s Deſcription of a Church, <hi>Corpus ſumus, de Conſcientia Religionis, et Diſciplinae Unitate, et Spei Foedere:</hi> Which is as much as to ſay, <hi>A Body United for the Conſcientious Obſervation of the Duties of Religion, by an Agreement in Diſcipline, and a CO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VENANT of Hope for Eternal Bleſſedneſs.</hi> The ſame <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in his <hi>Apology,</hi> ſays, that the Chriſtians then Aſſembled, <hi>Ad Confoederandam Diſciplinam;</hi> which intimates, that they had a <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> and a COVENANT for the <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</hi>

                  <hi>Pliny</hi> the Governour of <hi>Bithynia</hi> relates, in his Letter to the Emperor [which our <hi>Tertullian</hi> alſo refers to,] That ſome <hi>Renegado Chriſtians,</hi> being Examined about the ſecret, but ſacred <hi>Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> of the Faithful in thoſe Primitive Times, confeſſed no worſe of them than this; That they entred into a COVENANT,

In the Apology of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> who lived within a few Years of the Apoſtles themſelves, we find the Chriſtians who were admitted into <hi>Church-Fellowſhip,</hi> agreeing in a <hi>Reſolution to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form in all Things to the Word of GOD:</hi> Which ſeems to be as truly a <hi>Church-Covenant,</hi> as any in the Churches of <hi>New-England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And theſe Churches hope that they ſhall not hear that Reproached as a <hi>New Invention,</hi> which was practiſed in the <hi>Second</hi> and <hi>Third</hi> Centuries.</p>
               <p>The famous Dr. <hi>Hornbeck,</hi> a Profeſſor in the Univerſity of <hi>Leyden,</hi> who wrote in Defence of the <hi>Presbyterian Church-Government,</hi> has publiſhed his Approbation of what the <hi>New-Engliſh</hi> Divines <hi>Cotton,</hi> and <hi>Mather,</hi> and <hi>Norton,</hi> wrote in Defence of their <hi>Explicit Church-Government.</hi>

               <p>And <hi>Zepperus</hi> writes it as the Manner and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Churches in <hi>Holland; That when any Perſons are admitted unto the Lord's Table there, they make a publick Profeſſion of their Faith before all the Church; and likewiſe COVENANT, that they will continue in that Faith, and lead their Lives accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Several <hi>Synods</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi> have required <hi>Perſonal Covenanting</hi> with GOD, and the Church; and the Incomparable <hi>Voetius</hi> highly applauds their doing ſo.</p>
               <p>One of the <hi>Epiſcopal Way</hi> complains of the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> That they would not admit a Man to the <hi>Lord's Table</hi> without a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> (or COVENANT) of continuing in the <hi>Faith.</hi> 'Tis no more indeed, than what we find provided by their <hi>National Synods;</hi> That none
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002775_0028_0FE6303496DF6860"/>were admitted as Members of the <hi>Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> without a publick entring into a COVENANT of GOD, with <hi>Submiſſion to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The very learned <hi>Parker</hi> gives this Account of the <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> (whereto Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had exiled him) <hi>That when any Perſon ſeeks for Admiſſion into Church Communion, his Name is publiſhed in the Congregation, that if any one hath ought to object againſt the Perſon propounded, he ſhould acquaint the Elders therewith. If nothing is brought againſt him, he is admitted, but not without a Solemn COVENANT with GOD, and the Church: And to the Church he promiſes to walk as becomes that holy Fellowſhip: That he will ſubmit unto the Diſcipline of the Church; and that he will watch over the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of that Communion, according to the Command of CHRIST.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In fine, the Churches of <hi>New-England</hi> appear well ſatisfied with the Words of the famous <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I conclude, That whatever ſome particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may be guilty of, there is no real Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Presbyterians and Independents, in the Point of Church-Covenant. — GOD forbid, That any Faithful Miniſter of CHRIST, ſhould fight againſt that which is profitable to the Well-being of a Church, meerly becauſe the Church without it may have a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Then muſt we plead for Hunger and Want, and Calamitous Diſeaſes, that leave us but the Being of Men. Nature and the Scripture Praecedents in the Old Teſtament, and the Doctrine of the Apoſtles, and the Ancient Practice of the Churches, do ſatisfy us of the Uſefulneſs of holy Covenants, prudently, ſeriouſly, and ſeaſonably made.</hi>

               <p>Except the <hi>Major-Part</hi> of the Inhabitants (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive of the <hi>Communicants</hi>) do agree to this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Vote,</hi> the <hi>Act</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> does not in the <hi>Law,</hi> make the <hi>whole</hi> Taxable in the Mainten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Miniſter which the <hi>Church</hi> doth chuſe.</p>
               <p>In Caſe of a Difference between the <hi>Church</hi> and the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> on this Occaſion, the <hi>Law</hi> provides the Remedy of a <hi>Council,</hi> from three Neighbour Churches, to decide, <hi>Whether the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants ought to acquieſce in the Choice, wherein the Church has gone before them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 3. Tho' the <hi>Law</hi> of the Place, about the <hi>Chuſing and Settling of a Miniſter,</hi> (which has had the <hi>Royal Sanction</hi>) be a very wholeſome Law, and have much of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> in it, yet there grows too much upon the <hi>Inhabitants,</hi> who are not yet come into the <hi>Communion</hi> of the Churches, a Diſpoſition to ſuperſede it, and over-rule it; Many People would not allow the <hi>Church</hi> any Priviledge to go before them, in the Choice of a <hi>Paſtor.</hi> The Clamour is, <hi>We muſt maintain him!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some of our Divines having been on ſuch an Occaſion conſulted withal, have exhibited their Sentiments in theſe Concluſions.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>A Body of Chriſtians <hi>Aſſociated</hi> for all the Ordinances of the Goſpel, are a CHURCH of our Glorious LORD, which have among
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002775_0032_0FE6303C5D7E2008"/>other precious Priviledges, a RIGHT from HIM, <hi>To chuſe their own Paſtors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Churches</hi> which have recovered the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of this RIGHT <hi>from the Oppreſſion of Man,</hi> under which many <hi>Churches of the Reformation</hi> are to this Day groaning, ought to <hi>keep the Precepts,</hi> and the Favours of the Lord, and not eaſily part with what He has given them.</p>
                  <p>To introduce a <hi>Practice</hi> in the <hi>Choice of a Paſtor</hi> which being followed, may ſoon bring a <hi>Paſtor</hi> to be choſen for a <hi>Church,</hi> which <hi>few,</hi> yea, <hi>none</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> have ever Voted for, would be to <hi>Betray</hi> and even <hi>Deſtroy</hi> a moſt Valuable RIGHT, that ſuch a Society has a Claim unto, and many <hi>Evil Conſequences</hi> are to be expected from it.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs a CHURCH in the Exerciſe of its RIGHT, ought in all poſſible Ways conſiſtent therewithal, to conſult the <hi>Edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of their Neighbours; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of thoſe on whoſe <hi>Aſſiſtance,</hi> to carry on their Affairs, they may have much Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Church</hi> ought ſo to manage their <hi>Choice</hi> that if the Neighbours have any juſt <hi>Diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,</hi> all the Reſpect required by <hi>Scripture, Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>Gratitude,</hi> may be paid unto it.</p>
               </q>
               <p>To expreſs the <hi>Condeſcention,</hi> in the cloſe of theſe Concluſions, the Churches, do ſometimes, by their <hi>Vote,</hi> make a <hi>Nomination of Three or Four</hi> Candidates; For every One of which the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of the Brethren have ſo Voted, that whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever of theſe the <hi>Choice</hi> falls upon, it may ſtill be ſaid, <hi>The Church has Choſen him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="unknown:002775_0033_0FE6303E4BBE4960"/>
And then they bring this <hi>Nomination</hi> unto the other Inhabitants, to join with them, in a <hi>Vote</hi> that ſhall determine, which of them ſhall be the Man.</p>
               <p>But what muſt be the Age of the <hi>Candidate?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Without any Information from the Gentlemen who have (like <hi>Bartholomaeus Agricola</hi>) written, <hi>De Aetate ineuntium Officia;</hi> We know, not only what was the <hi>Age</hi> of Admiſſion to the Exerciſe the <hi>Prieſthood</hi> under the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Law; but alſo, how critical the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were about it; <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ab Alexandro</hi> ſets the Age, when One would think it fitter to <hi>lay down</hi> than to <hi>take up</hi> an Office; And we have <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Exclamation; <hi>Quae major Contumelia eſt, quam venire in Sacerdotium imberbem Adoleſcentulum?</hi> Nevertheleſs, in theſe Days of the <hi>New-Teſtament,</hi> there is <hi>nothing certain</hi> defined about the Number of Years, which a Miniſter of the Goſpel, muſt have paſſed before he be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained. Some <hi>Councils</hi> have ſet a <hi>Number of Years</hi> for it; But the learned <hi>Reizius</hi> paſſes a Cenſure on them, as having done <hi>Incautelouſly;</hi> and he brings the Inſtance of <hi>Timothy,</hi> who while he was but a <hi>Young Man,</hi> ſo diſcharged the <hi>Evangelical Miniſtry,</hi> as to be no diſhonour to it: And the Words of <hi>Bullinger</hi> have their Weight in them; <hi>Hominem Ingenia, non a Vetuſtate, ut Vina, aeſtimanda ſunt; ſed ab ipſa probitate et Eruditione.</hi> Accordingly the Churches of <hi>New-England,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider not ſo much the <hi>Age,</hi> as the <hi>Worth</hi> of a Candidate for an <hi>Ordination</hi> in them. And their Glorious Lord often bleſſes them with <hi>Elihu</hi>'s; They often ſee very <hi>Young Miniſters,</hi> who give
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002775_0034_0FE6303E4FF363A8"/>them Occaſion to think on the Jewiſh Maxim, <hi>Sapiens appellatur Senex, etiamſi Diebus ſit Exiguus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 4. Now they proceed unto a <hi>Salary,</hi> to be offered unto the <hi>Miniſter,</hi> whom they have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen. [To which there is uſually added ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what alſo, which they call, <hi>A Settlement,</hi> in order to ſome Subſiſtence of his Family, in Caſe he dy among them.] This no doubt, will be <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate</hi> enough: But ſuch as they may think will ſuffice a <hi>Divine</hi> of that Order, which <hi>Eraſmus</hi> has deſcribed in his Preface to his <hi>New Teſtament. Is mihi THEOLOGUS eſt, qui non Syllogiſmis Arte contortis, ſed Affectu, ſed ipſo Vultu atque Oculis, ſed ipſa Vita doceat, aſpernandas eſſe opes Chriſtiano, non eſſe fidendum hujus Mundi Praeſidiis, ſed totum opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere pendere de Caelo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There have too frequently all along been <hi>cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable Proceedings,</hi> and a <hi>Withholding of more than is meet,</hi> in the Churches under the Diſpenſation of the <hi>New Teſtament;</hi> relating to this Affair: And they that have <hi>abhorred Idols,</hi> have yet <hi>committed Sacriledge.</hi> Beſides more early Reſervations of the <hi>Church-Stock,</hi> only ΤΟΙΣ ΔΕΟΜΕΝΟΙΣ, <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> tells us, that in <hi>Elections,</hi> thoſe of the Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors that had <hi>Eſtates of their own</hi> carried it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Churches would ſave the Charges of maintaining them. Yea, ſome <hi>Councils</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, and ſinfully enough, provided, That <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,</hi> tho' learned Men, ſhould ſubſiſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on ſome honeſt <hi>Imployment,</hi> with a <hi>Proviſo,</hi> which 'tis a Wonder how any Wiſe Men could propoſe it, <hi>That it be no Prejudice to their Office.</hi> And how <hi>ſtrait handed</hi> this way many Profeſſors
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002775_0035_0FE63043C5E0FD58"/>of Religion in the <hi>Churches of the Reformation</hi> have been, hath been known and felt, and thouſands of times complained of.</p>
               <p>The Churches of <hi>New-England</hi> have <hi>not ſo learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed CHRIST.</hi> They make the moſt publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognitions, of their <hi>Obligations</hi> to that plain and juſt Law of CHRIST, <hi>They which preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, ſhould live of the Goſpel.</hi> And a Decree of a National Synod of the Reformed Churches in <hi>France,</hi> has been conſidered among them; which ran in thoſe Terms;
<q>All the Churches ſhall be deſired to ſhun Ingratitude unto their Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, a Sin too rife among us; and take ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Care, that they be more reſpected and their Labours better rewarded: Not to enrich and fatten them, but to give them a becoming and ſufficient Maintenance.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In ſome Churches, the Salary of the Miniſter is raiſed by a <hi>Voluntary Contribution;</hi> eſpecially in populous Places, and where many Strangers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort; But in others, a <hi>Tax</hi> is levied for it; there being too much Truth in <hi>Luther</hi>'s Words

The <hi>Laws</hi> of the Province, having had the <hi>Royal Approbation</hi> to ratify them; they are, <hi>The Kings Laws.</hi> By theſe Laws, it is Enacted, <hi>That</hi> there ſhall be a <hi>Public Worſhip</hi> of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002775_0036_0FE63043CA2FE518"/>GOD in every Plantation; That the Perſon Elected by the <hi>Majority</hi> of the Inhabitants to be ſo, ſhall be looked upon as, <hi>The Miniſter of the Place:</hi> That the <hi>Salary</hi> for him, which they ſhall agree upon, ſhall be levied by a Rate upon all the Inhabitants. In Conſequence of this, the <hi>Miniſter</hi> thus Choſen by the People, is (not only CHRIST's, but alſo) in Reality, <hi>The Kings Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter.</hi> And the <hi>Salary</hi> raiſed for him, is raiſed in the <hi>Kings</hi> Name, and is the <hi>Kings</hi> Allowance unto him. If the moſt of the Inhabitants in a Plantation, are <hi>Epiſcopalians,</hi> they will have a <hi>Miniſter</hi> of their own Perſwaſion. And the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters,</hi> if there be any, in the Place, muſt pay their Proportion of the <hi>Tax,</hi> for the Support of this <hi>Legal Miniſter.</hi> In a few of the Towns, a few of the People, in Hope, of being releaſed from the Tax for the <hi>Legal Miniſter,</hi> ſometimes profeſs themſelves <hi>Epiſcopalians.</hi> But when they plead This for their Exemption, their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours tell them, <hi>They know in their Conſcience, they do not as they would be done unto.</hi> And if a Governour, go by his Arbitrary Power, to ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſede the Execution of the Law, and require the <hi>Juſtices</hi> and <hi>Conſtables</hi> to leave the <hi>Epiſcopalians</hi> out of the Tax, the People wonder, he is not aware, that he is all this while, forbidding, <hi>That the King ſhould have his Dues paid unto him;</hi> and forbidding the <hi>Kings Miniſter</hi> to receive what the <hi>King</hi> has given him. However, the <hi>generous Condeſcenſions</hi> that have been ſometimes made in this Matter, are ſuch, that the People of <hi>New-England</hi> have therein Exemplarily, <hi>adorned the Doctrine of GOD their SAVIOUR,</hi> and have done
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002775_0037_0FE630464F70E180"/>what has not been ordinarily exemplified among <hi>any other</hi> People. Sometimes the <hi>Quakers</hi> alſo, have given ſome Occaſion for Uneaſineſs. But, Where <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> is troubleſome, ſome Towns are ſo wiſe to involve the Salary of the Miniſtry in a <hi>general Rate</hi> for all <hi>Town Charges,</hi> and ſo the Cavils of thoſe, who would elſe refuſe to pay the Rate for the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> are obviated.</p>
               <p>How many of our Miniſters, do yet generouſly ſpend very much upon their <hi>own Eſtates:</hi> And how unfairly and untruly, ſome of them have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten been defrauded of their Dues; and how pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently and holily they have encountred their <hi>Temptations,</hi> has been <hi>known</hi> unto their Glorious LORD.</p>
               <p>§. 5. Things being thus prepared, the <hi>Brethren</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> do by a renewed Vote, now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, <hi>That they make Choice of</hi> Mr. A. B. <hi>to be their Paſtor;</hi> and appoint certain Perſons to wait upon him, with a Report of this their Vote, and conſult with him about a Day for his <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In theſe Proceedings there is a Seaſonable Care taken, That if he were a Member of ſome <hi>other Church,</hi> he have his <hi>Diſmiſſion,</hi> (his Relation declared to be transferred,) unto that which now have their Eye upon him, to be their <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;</hi> that as near as may be, according to the Primitive Direction, They may <hi>chuſe from among themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 6. The <hi>Day</hi> for his <hi>Ordination</hi> being agreed upon, the Brethren agree with him; what <hi>Churches</hi> they will deſire to be preſent at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Solemnity. <hi>Letters</hi> are then addreſſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:002775_0038_0FE6304653972300"/>each of theſe Churches;
<q>
                     <hi>Informing</hi> them, that they have made Choice of ſuch a Perſon for their <hi>Paſtor;</hi> and <hi>Requeſting</hi> them, that they would by their <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Meſſengers,</hi> afford their Preſence and Countenance, and Aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, unto his Ordination; [<hi>At the Time and Place now ſpecified:</hi>] and concluding with ſuch Expreſſions of holy Affection and Charity as would be dictated by our holy Religion, on ſuch an Occaſion.</q> The Letters are <hi>Subſcribed</hi> by ſuch of the Church, as are judged moſt ſuitable to do it, <hi>In the Name of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Brethren</hi> uſe to make Choice of ſome Neighbouring <hi>Paſtors,</hi> (among thoſe whom they have ſent unto,) to perform the IMPOSITION OF HANDS in the deſigned <hi>Ordination;</hi> And <hi>One</hi> among them to make the <hi>Prayers,</hi> and give the <hi>Charges</hi> in that Action: Unto which <hi>One</hi> at leaſt, they privately ſome Days aforehand, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy what they have thus <hi>Voted,</hi> that ſo he may <hi>prepare</hi> to anſwer their Expectations. And in all thoſe Points, they have a private Conference and Concurrence with the Perſon that is to be <hi>ordained.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes the Church leaves it unto the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the <hi>Council,</hi> at their coming together on this Occaſion, to determine, Who of their Number ſhall take part in the <hi>Impoſition of Hands,</hi> at the <hi>Ordination.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 7. When the <hi>Council</hi> of the Neighbouring <hi>Paſtors,</hi> and the <hi>Meſſengers</hi> whom the Churches addreſs'd unto, have choſen to accompany them, do come together, unto the Houſe aſſigned
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:002775_0039_0FE6304BC7EE78C8"/>them, and formed themſelves into a <hi>Council</hi> with the Choice of their <hi>Moderator,</hi> [where the <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons</hi> of that Church are now attending upon them,] the Church ſend ſome of their principal Brethren, to inform them, that they have deſired ſuch a Reverend Perſon (unto whom accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly they now apply themſelves,) to manage the Votes, and give the Charge in the Ordination to which they are now approaching: And what Reverend Perſons they have deſired for to join with him in the <hi>Impoſition of Hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Council</hi> then (if they have no <hi>Objection</hi> to make againſt the Intentions of the Day,) appoint one of their Number to give <hi>the Fellowſhip of the Churches,</hi> in their Name, unto the Perſon that ſhall be ordained.</p>
               <p>Thus we find in the <hi>Primitive Times;</hi> A <hi>Paſtor</hi> elected by the <hi>People, was ordained,</hi> (as <hi>Euſebius</hi> expreſſes it,) <hi>With the common Conſent of the Biſhops in the Vicinity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Council</hi> then walk in order, with the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be <hi>ordained,</hi> unto the <hi>Publick Aſſembly:</hi> which is uſually a very thronged one: But with ſome Seats left appropriated; ſome for the <hi>Council</hi> now convened; ſome for the <hi>Brethren</hi> of the Church whoſe <hi>Vote</hi> is anon to be called for. For as <hi>Jerom</hi> of old, <hi>Requiritur in Sacerdote ordinando, etiam Populi praeſentia.</hi> And <hi>Cyprian</hi> would have the <hi>Paſtor Eſtabliſhed in the Preſence of all the People, who have narrowly obſerved his Converſation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 8. The Day is (or ſhould be!) kept a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Faſt</hi> unto the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="unknown:002775_0040_0FE6304BCDB56258"/>
In former times, on the longer Days, it was no unuſual Thing, to have <hi>Two</hi> public Meetings, both a <hi>Forenoon,</hi> and an <hi>Afternoon</hi> Service, on this Occaſion.</p>
               <p>The Cuſtom has been, that among the other Exerciſes of the Day, the Perſon expecting his <hi>Ordination,</hi> does by <hi>Praying</hi> and <hi>Preaching</hi> before the Aſſembly, give ſome Diſcovery, that he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands the <hi>Work,</hi> to which he is now to be <hi>Separated.</hi> Several of theſe, have been afterwards publiſhed, by which it may be ſeen, how <hi>compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to fine Gold,</hi> have been the <hi>Nazarites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of later Times, 'tis grown Cuſtomary, if there be time for it, for ſome <hi>Elder Divine</hi> alſo to give a Sermon proper for the ſolemn Occaſion; and for ſome ſuch to make ſome of the Supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Yea, Sometimes the Perſon to be Ordained has of late been excuſed from Offering any Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon at all on this Day; it being (by ſome) thought more decent for ſome Elder <hi>Divine,</hi> to deliver ſuch Things as are moſt proper for the Day.</p>
               <p>When theſe are over, The MODERATOR, mentioning the Reaſon of their being thus aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled; Firſt, applies himſelf unto the <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Meſſengers</hi> of the Churches there preſent, and ſignifies unto them,
<q>That if they have any <hi>Objection</hi> to make againſt the <hi>Ordination</hi> which is now otherwiſe to be proceeded in, they have now an Opportunity to offer it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>None</hi> being offered; (after a due Pauſe) he then applies himſelf to the whole <hi>Congregation,</hi> and particularly to thoſe who propoſe to ſit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:002775_0041_0FE6304E8C9A41E0"/>the Miniſtry now to be eſtabliſhed, with an Intimation,
<q>That if any of the People know any thing, either in the <hi>Doctrines</hi> or the <hi>Morals</hi> of the Perſon, who now ſtands a Candidate for an <hi>Ordination,</hi> that may be a juſt <hi>Objection</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt him, they have now a Liberty to tender it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Nothing being tendered, he now applies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto the <hi>Brethren</hi> of the CHURCH, who have called the Aſſembly thus together, deſiring them, <hi>That, if they abide by their Choice of</hi> Mr. A. B. <hi>to be their Paſtor, and will according to the Word of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, ſubmit unto him as their Overſeer, and One who is to Watch for their Souls, they would ſignify it by lifting up their Hands.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Moderator</hi> then ſignifies to the Aſſembly that a certain Miniſter then preſent, is choſen by the <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Meſſengers</hi> of the Churches, to give in their Name, unto the Perſon thus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, <hi>The Right Hand of their Fellowſhip.</hi>

<pb n="64" facs="unknown:002775_0079_0FE63098AAAEC5E8"/>thereon, be not an Ordinance, the Omiſſion whereof is culpable among us?</hi> It muſt be confeſſed, That the Practice has not been ſo generally taken up, as many have wiſhed for. And that the thing may be fairly repreſented, Thoſe who have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto continued in the Omiſſion have pleaded;
<q>
                     <hi>That</hi> they could not at preſent ſee either <hi>Precept</hi> or <hi>Pattern</hi> for the <hi>Reading of the Scriptures</hi> in our <hi>Churches,</hi> without <hi>Expoſition</hi> upon it;</q> nor does it ſeem to belong unto the Work of a <hi>Paſtor:</hi>
                  <q>
                     <hi>That,</hi> in every Sermon duely compoſed, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Portion of the <hi>Scripture</hi> is <hi>read,</hi> with the Advantage of its being reſerred unto its <hi>Place</hi> and <hi>Uſe</hi> in Divinity: <hi>That,</hi> for thoſe who are <hi>Gifted that way</hi> to go over greater or leſſer <hi>Paragraphs of Scripture,</hi> with <hi>Expoſitory Lectures</hi> upon them, is a thing much to be deſired: but the <hi>Gifts</hi> of ſome Perſons may be more profitably employed in <hi>another Way</hi> handling the Word of GOD: <hi>That,</hi> there are <hi>ſome Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> which perhaps may not be ſo proper to be <hi>read publickly</hi> in our Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; And finally, <hi>That</hi> we ſhould be wary, how we introduce into the Congregations an Exerciſe which may at all invite <hi>private Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> to neglect any of their Duties in their <hi>private Families;</hi> whereof that of <hi>Reading the Scriptures</hi> is one.</q>
               </p>
               <p>On the other ſide, There is no Name held in greater Veneration, than that of the Memorable JOHN COTTON, in the Churches of <hi>New-England,</hi> which yet will not build on any <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> but that of the APOSTLES. This emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:002775_0080_0FE63098AE94BA78"/>Perſon, in a Book about <hi>Singing of Pſalms,</hi> Printed in the Year, 1647. over and over again, does inſiſt upon it, <hi>That the very Reading of the Scriptures, tends to Edification, as being an Ordinance of GOD; and the Expounding and Applying of them by the Spiritual Gifts of Miniſters, is another Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</hi> He does inſiſt upon it, <hi>The very Reading of them is an Ordinance of GOD; and no Ordinance of GOD is empty, and beggarly and deſtitute of the Spirit: which is the Vanity of Mens Traditions, and may not be imputed to any of GOD's Ordinances.</hi> Deut. XXXI. 11, 12, 13. XXVII. 14. to 26.</p>
               <p>Accordingly the Cuſtom of <hi>Reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> without <hi>Explication</hi> and <hi>Exhortation</hi> upon it, is practiſed in many of our Churches. They look upon ſuch an <hi>Exerciſe of Piety,</hi> to be an <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance</hi> of GOD, and a proper Expreſſion of the <hi>Reſpect</hi> which we owe unto His <hi>Lively Oracles;</hi> In our <hi>Confeſſion of Faith</hi> alſo, <hi>The Reading of the Scriptures</hi> is diſtinctly mentioned, with, <hi>Preaching and Hearing the Word of GOD,</hi> as parts of <hi>Religious Worſhip;</hi> And they think, they cannot without it, vindicate our Churches from the Imputation, which ſome who differ from them will caſt upon them for the Omiſſion of it.</p>
               <p>It is alſo true, That in many of the <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> the Work of Reading is not aſſigned unto the Paſtors; They as well as the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, have other, to be the Readers. But none of our <hi>Paſtors</hi> think themſelves too conſiderable, to be the <hi>Readers</hi> of the <hi>Letters</hi> which our Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious LORD, has in His Bible ſent unto His <hi>Creatures.</hi>

The Churches which yet omit this Exerciſe, do ſpeak of it ſtill with a becoming <hi>Reverence;</hi> but many ſeem to wiſh, that it may have an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition</hi> or <hi>Application</hi> ſtill attending of it.

<q>For laying aſide the <hi>Expoſition</hi> of what is <hi>Read,</hi> I would Recommend the excellent Words of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> (on 1 Johan.) where ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scripture, he ſays, <hi>Quare legitur, ſi ſilebitur; aut quare auditur, ſi non exponitur?</hi>

                  </q> The Scriptures of both Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do likewiſe furniſh us with Intimations of ſomething that looked that Way, in the Jewiſh Aſſemblies, (Neh. VIII. 8.

But <hi>Philo</hi> tells us, when one of the <hi>Elders,</hi> does <hi>Read the Law,</hi> ΚΑΘ' ΕΚΑΣΤΟΝ ΕΞΗΓΕΙΤΑΙ, <hi>He expounds it ſeverally.</hi> Yea, as long ago as the <hi>Babyloniſh Captivity,</hi> this was unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly one Exerciſe in the <hi>Holy Convocation</hi> every <hi>Sabbath-Day,</hi> that the <hi>Levites</hi> were to <hi>teach the People the</hi> (Meaning of the) <hi>Law,</hi> as well as <hi>put Incenſe upon the Altar,</hi> and they were to <hi>inſtruct Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael in the Word of GOD.</hi> The <hi>Gemara</hi> has an Obſervation, <hi>That Reading was no Miniſtry.</hi> But indeed the <hi>Interpretation</hi> which after the Captivity, they inſiſted on, ſeems to be chiefly intended, for the rendring of the <hi>Scripture</hi> in the <hi>Language</hi> then <hi>Vulgarly</hi> uſed among them; However not only ſo.</p>
               <p>The Reſult of theſe Conſiderations is, that in many Churches, the <hi>Reading of Chapters</hi> in Courſe, with a ſhort <hi>Prayer</hi> for a Bleſſing on it, is one of the Publick <hi>Exerciſes;</hi> nor is any Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence taken in others at them for doing ſo.

<q>The Laws by which our SAVIOUR will have His Kingdom to be governed, are adminiſtred in the <hi>Corporations</hi> thereof. <hi>Particular Churches</hi> of Believers, aſſociating to Worſhip our SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR in all His Ordinances, when furniſhed with <hi>Paſtors,</hi> are ſuch <hi>Corporations.</hi> But the Great KING has many <hi>Subjects</hi> in His <hi>Viſible
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:002775_0084_0FE6309EE60E37D0"/>Kingdom,</hi> who are not yet <hi>conſtituent Members</hi> of the <hi>Corporations.</hi> They who openly profeſs the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and make Choice of the True GOD, for <hi>Their GOD,</hi> and ſubmit unto the Laws of His Kingdom, and have nothing in their <hi>Converſation</hi> that may give a notorious Contradiction to this <hi>Profeſſion;</hi> Theſe are to be owned as, <hi>The People of GOD.</hi> We durſt not ſay, There is no Difference between <hi>Theſe</hi> and <hi>Pagans.</hi> We cannot but own <hi>Theſe,</hi> for <hi>Subjects</hi> in the <hi>Viſible Kingdom</hi> of our Glorious LORD. We cannot anſwer it unto GOD, or His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to deny unto Theſe, and unto the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of theſe, the <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> with which the <hi>Subjects</hi> of our SAVIOUR, are to be Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed and Acknowledged.</q>
               </p>
               <p>There appears a <hi>Lively Emblem</hi> of this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Conſtitution of the <hi>Engliſh Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it has been ſaid, — <hi>The Offſpring of Theſe.</hi> — The Firſt Planters of <hi>New-England,</hi> having their Eye very much upon the Welfare of their <hi>Offſpring,</hi> it can't be wondred at, if the Churches are for having their <hi>Offſpring</hi> brought with them into the <hi>Covenant</hi> of their GOD. They find the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> under the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended unto the <hi>Offſpring</hi> of the Faithful: And they have not yet ſeen any Scripture in the <hi>New</hi> to cut them off, or ſhut them out. No; But the Infants of the Faithful are there called, <hi>Holy Ones;</hi> And they think, <hi>Holy Ones</hi> ought to be <hi>Baptiſed,</hi> and come under a <hi>Baptiſmal Conſecration.</hi> They do not know, That our Gracious GOD ever
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:002775_0085_0FE630A2FAE5AEB8"/>took a People into His <hi>Covenant,</hi> but He took their <hi>Offſpring</hi> with them.</p>
               <p>Wherefore,</p>
               <p>The BAPTISM of the Lord, is adminiſtred in the Churches, not only unto thoſe who <hi>actually</hi> and <hi>publickly</hi> give their Conſent unto the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace,</hi> but alſo to the <hi>Infants</hi> of ſuch <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Believers.</hi> They do not think, that in thus practiſing of <hi>Infant Baptiſm,</hi> they can be charged with departing from the Practiſe of the <hi>Primitive Churches. Origen</hi> expreſly ſays, <hi>Parvuli baptizan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur in Remiſſionem Peccatorum; Little Children</hi> are <hi>baptized;</hi> Even ſuch as he ſuppoſes to be, <hi>under three or four Years old.</hi> The Teſtimonies of <hi>Irenae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and <hi>Cyprian,</hi> for <hi>Infant Baptiſm</hi> are well known. And it is well known that an <hi>Affrican</hi> Council whereat Threeſcore and Six Biſhops were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, A. C. 254. Conſidering the Caſe, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Infants</hi> might be <hi>baptiſed,</hi> before the ſecond or third, or eighth Day, determined the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of <hi>Infants</hi> to be performed as ſoon as it was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be expected: <hi>Baptiſm</hi> they would have obſerved, <hi>Magis circa Infantes ipſos et Recens Natos,</hi> rather for <hi>new born Infants</hi> than for any.</p>
               <p>§. 3. But <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is here, after this Manner fought for.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Adult</hi> Perſon, firſt applying himſelf to the Paſtor, the Paſtor examines the <hi>Knowledge</hi> and the <hi>Belief</hi> of the Perſon, and obtains alſo, a Teſtimony of his <hi>Good Converſation,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with perceives the Diſpoſitions of <hi>a Saving Faith,</hi> at leaſt <hi>hopefully begun</hi> in him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="unknown:002775_0086_0FE630A303569D40"/>
The Perſon is then publickly <hi>propounded</hi> by the Paſtor in the Congregation; <hi>As having offered his Deſires to be received into the Covenant, and under the Government of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Week or two after this, if no <hi>Scandal</hi> be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, the Paſtor publickly mentions it in the Congregation; <hi>That ſuch a one is to draw near, and receive what he has deſired and ſought for.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereupon he tenders unto the Perſon, the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> in Terms of This Importance.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>You, Profeſſing a ſerious Belief of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Religion, as it is contained in the ſacred Scriptures, and uſually embraced by the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in this Place, (and explained in our well-known Catechiſm;) do give up your ſelf to GOD, in our Lord JESUS CHRIST; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving, with His Help, to conform your Life to the Rules of that Holy Religion, as long as you Live, and Repenting of all things wherein you have tranſgreſſed thoſe Rules of Holineſs. You give up your ſelf unto the LORD JEHOVAH, who is the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and receive Him, as your GOD and Portion. You give up your ſelf unto the Lord JESUS CHRIST, who is the Lord Jehovah, and Rely upon Him as the Head of His People in the Covenant of Grace; and as your Prophet, and Prieſt, and King for ever. You ſubmit to the Laws of His King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as they are adminiſtred among this His People: And will herewith be at Pains to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that further Preparation of the Sanctuary, which may embolden your further Approaches

               <p>I ſaid, — [<hi>with Terms of this Importance</hi>] becauſe if in the ſhort <hi>Renunciation</hi> of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and the <hi>World,</hi> and the <hi>Devil,</hi> uſed at <hi>Baptiſm</hi> in the Primitive Times, they uſed ſuch a <hi>Variety of Terms,</hi> that we can Count more than Twenty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Variations</hi> of that <hi>ſhort Sentence,</hi> which we have met withal in the Writings of the Ancients, there can be no mighty Damage or Danger in it, if the Expreſſions <hi>of this Matter</hi> be <hi>varied</hi> in theſe Churches; while the <hi>Variations</hi> are all ſtill with Terms of this <hi>Importance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now, the Perſon expreſſing his Conſent hereunto, is qualified for the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of the Lord, both for <hi>himſelf,</hi> and for <hi>his Houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> informs us, That in his Time, it was expected, <hi>That Perſons ſhould give good Proofs of their Reſolutions to lead a Pious and Religious Life, and proteſt their Aſſent and Conſent unto all the Chriſtian Verities,</hi> e're their Claim to <hi>Baptiſm</hi> could be acknowledged.</p>

Baſil</hi> defended this, by the Plea which <hi>Irenaeus</hi> had uſed before him, in the Defence of it; That the Name of <hi>One</hi> is <hi>an Acknowledgement of the whole.</hi> Agreeably whereto <hi>Theophylact</hi> affirms, <hi>That he who is baptiſed into the Name of JESUS CHRIST, is baptiſed into the Trinity; for the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, are not parted.</hi> And <hi>Ambroſe</hi> affirms, <hi>Qui unum dixit, Trinitatem ſignavit.</hi> Others there were, who tho' they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the <hi>Three Perſons</hi> of the Godhead in the Words of our Saviour, yet enlarged upon them. It ſeems by <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> that ſuch Words as theſe were ſometimes uſed; <hi>In the Name of the Father of all things, and of our Lord God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, and of the Holy Spirit, this Waſhing with Water is performed.</hi> And ſometimes the latter Clauſes were thus varied; <hi>In the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, who was crucified under Pontius Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and in the Name of the Holy Spirit who by the Prophets foretold all Things, concerning Jeſus, he that is to be illuminited is baptiſed.</hi> Briefly, they tho't a, ΤΑΥΤΟΝ ΠΡΟΣΔΙΑΝΟΙΑΝ <hi>a Conformity in Senſe,</hi> to be ſufficient; without confining themſelves to the Words mentioned (I ſay <hi>mentioned,</hi> becauſe Mr <hi>Gilleſpy</hi> will not let me ſay, <hi>preſcribed,</hi>) by our Saviour.</p>
               <p>But in the Churches of <hi>New-England</hi> ſuch a <hi>Liberty</hi> is neither practiſed nor approved. In their <hi>Baptiſms,</hi> the <hi>Paſtors,</hi> pouring of <hi>Water</hi> with his <hi>Hand,</hi> on the <hi>Face</hi> of the Perſon before him, confines himſelf to the Words of the Inſtitution.

               <p>Upon this the <hi>Paſtor</hi> annexes another ſhort <hi>Prayer,</hi> wherein he commends the <hi>Infants,</hi> (if they be ſuch) with their <hi>Parents,</hi> or the <hi>Perſons baptiſed,</hi> unto the Mercies of GOD, in the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> now ſealed unto them. He prays for the Mercies of the <hi>Covenant;</hi> particularly, that Application of the <hi>Blood of Sprinkling,</hi> and that Effuſion of the <hi>Spirit of Grace,</hi> and that Portion in the <hi>Reſurrection of the Juſt,</hi> whereof <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is to the Faithful, <hi>a Token for Good:</hi> And ſuch a part in the <hi>Heavenly City,</hi> as God has prepared for them to whom He will be <hi>their GOD.</hi> He ſubjoins Petitions, that <hi>they,</hi> (and <hi>all</hi>) may as they grow up, remember alſo the <hi>Duties</hi> of the <hi>Covenant.</hi> And the Petitions on this Occaſion put up for the <hi>Young People</hi> of the Flock, that they may be mindful of their <hi>Baptiſmal Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and become ſhining Examples of <hi>Early Piety,</hi> are ſometimes very flaming and Patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</p>
               <p>Some few, inſtead of this latter Prayer, do give the <hi>Parents</hi> a brief <hi>Admonition</hi> to bring up their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the <hi>Narture and Admonition of the Lord.</hi> Be ſure, if an <hi>Adult</hi> Perſon be <hi>baptiſed,</hi> an <hi>Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,</hi> has been ſometimes, thought very agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to accompany the <hi>latter Prayer.</hi>

In <hi>Hot Countrys</hi> it might well enough be by <hi>Dipping;</hi> In <hi>Cold</hi> ones <hi>Affuſion,</hi> or <hi>Aſperſion</hi> may be enough; <hi>Dipping</hi> they fear would hardly keep in good Terms with the <hi>Sixth Commandment,</hi> in hazarding the Life of ſome Diſciples; or the <hi>Third,</hi> in expecting of Miracles to keep them alive. The Proof of a <hi>Total Dipping</hi> in the ſcriptural Examples of <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> does not appear ſo plain and full, that they ſhould lay the <hi>whole Streſs</hi> of the Sacrament up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. What we read of our Saviour at His <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> is only, that <hi>He went up from the Water.</hi> There muſt be a <hi>Deſcent</hi> unto the ſide of a <hi>River;</hi> And like <hi>Solomon</hi> crowned by the ſide of a <hi>River,</hi> our Lord might there have the <hi>Water</hi> poured up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Him, without a compleat <hi>Immerſion.</hi> All that can be proved of what paſſed between the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt</hi> and the <hi>Ethiopian,</hi> for the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is that they came to the <hi>Bank</hi> of a Brook, which both <hi>Jerom</hi> and <hi>Sandys</hi> repreſent as a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unlikely one for an <hi>Immerſion</hi> to be performed there. Indeed, the <hi>Baptiſms</hi> of <hi>John</hi> did require <hi>much Water;</hi> For, while the Rites of <hi>Purification</hi> were continued among the <hi>Jews</hi> it would have been thought a Scandal for <hi>one Veſſel of Water</hi> to have ſerved ſucceſſively for the <hi>baptizing</hi> of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Perſons. If it were ſo, there were occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:002775_0093_0FE630B677311AC8"/>of <hi>much Water</hi> to ſupply, tho' but a <hi>Baſin</hi> for a Perſon. And indeed it looks not very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that <hi>John</hi> ſtood ſo many <hi>whole Days</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the <hi>Water,</hi> as he muſt have done, if he <hi>dipped</hi> all that he <hi>baptized</hi> in the few Months of his Miniſtry, which were doubtleſs many <hi>Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands.</hi> Yea, there are ſome Examples of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> where the probability ſeems rather on the <hi>other ſide;</hi> that there was not an <hi>Immerſion</hi> in it. Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when we read of <hi>whole Houſholds baptiſed</hi> in the <hi>Depth of the Night,</hi> and at a <hi>private Houſe,</hi> where 'tis not ſo eaſy to ſuppoſe a <hi>Depth of Water</hi> for the Action. It is well known, that the <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits</hi> ſealed by <hi>Baptiſm</hi> are ſet forth by <hi>Sprinkling,</hi> [1 Per. 1. 1. Iſai. 1. 11. 15. Ezek. XXXVI. 25.] Now, if the thing <hi>ſignified,</hi> be a <hi>Sprinkling,</hi> what need the Sign be any more than a <hi>Sprinkling?</hi> And whereas there is a <hi>Baptiſm of the Holy Spirit,</hi> we do not read of Men's being <hi>dipped</hi> into the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> but of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> being <hi>poured</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. The Word <hi>Baptize</hi> may ſignifie any Waſhing whatſoever. The <hi>Waſhing</hi> of no more than the <hi>Hands</hi> is called the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of the <hi>Man.</hi> [Luk. XI. 38. Mar. VII. 4.] And why ſhould not the Waſhing of the <hi>Face</hi> be ſo? Yea, we read, Heb. IX. 10. of <hi>Diverſe Baptiſms.</hi> And we are certain, a very great part of them were no more than <hi>Sprinklings.</hi> And indeed, none but <hi>Sprinklings</hi> are expreſly mentioned in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text. Such a Miſtake it is, to ſay, that a <hi>Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> is not called <hi>Baptiſm</hi> in the holy Language. The Holy Spirit expreſly calls it ſo. It refers eſpecially to Numb. VIII. 7. <hi>Thus ſhalt thou do unto them to cleanſe them; Sprinkle Water of Purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     </gap>tification,</hi> that is to reſemble the <hi>Burial</hi> of our Saviour. We are by <hi>Baptiſm</hi> obliged unto a Conformity unto the <hi>Death</hi> of our <hi>Buried</hi> JESUS, and unto His <hi>Riſing</hi> again; unto His <hi>Death,</hi> by our <hi>Dying</hi> to Sin; unto His <hi>Riſing</hi> again in our <hi>Living</hi> to GOD. Our <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is not ſo much that <hi>Burial,</hi> as the Seal of our <hi>Obligation</hi> to it. <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is alſo a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament that ſeals the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the Faithful from their <hi>Graves,</hi> wherein we are firſt <hi>buried,</hi> as Chriſt was, and then <hi>raiſed</hi> like Him. Here is nothing to Intimate that in <hi>Baptiſm</hi> our Bodies muſt be all under <hi>Water.</hi> When a Man is buried he does not walk into the <hi>Grave</hi> himſelf, nor is he in the leaſt active to put a Leg or a Foot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Earth. Yea, our Mode of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> ſeems more like to a <hi>Burial,</hi> than that of <hi>Plunging;</hi> For the throwing of <hi>Water</hi> on the Perſon is more like to the throwing of <hi>Earth</hi> upon the Dead.

Now no Man does <hi>baptiſe</hi> himſelf; No Action of the Perſon to be <hi>baptiſed,</hi> is any Part of the <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> It follows, that the <hi>Waſhing</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> but <hi>in Part,</hi> may be ſufficient for the ſacred <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> And, if the <hi>Waſhing</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> but <hi>in Part,</hi> may be ſufficient for the <hi>ſacred Baptiſm,</hi> then the Waſhing of the

               </p>
               <p>Since the <hi>Reformation,</hi> 'tis well known, that the moſt eminent Reformers, not only in their <hi>Doctrine</hi> aſſerted, but alſo in their <hi>Practice</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, a <hi>ſtricter Selection</hi> of thoſe that ſhould be admitted unto the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> when they have been <hi>larger</hi> in the point of <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> and they went upon this Principle, That <hi>not all the baptiſed Chriſtians, but ſuch as might be reputed able and careful to Examine themſelves, and diſcern the Lord's Body, are to be received unto the Supper of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It would fill many Pages, to recite the many Paſſages, in the Writings of the <hi>Reformers,</hi> which countenance the Churches of <hi>New-England</hi> in their Way of a <hi>ſtricter Selection.</hi> Two ſhall ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſede all the Reſt; The One ſhall be of a <hi>Luther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi> 'Tis <hi>Gerhard,</hi> who ſays,
<q>That not all Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians are to be admitted to the Holy Supper, but according to '<hi>Paul</hi>'s Rule, they that Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine themſelves, diſcern the Lord's Body and ſhew forth the Lord's Death: All thoſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are excluded, who either will not, or can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Examine themſelves.</q> The other ſhall be of a <hi>Calviniſt; Beza</hi> 'tis, who ſays,
<q>That no one is to be admitted unto the Lord's Supper, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he has one way or other, ſo given an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Faith, as that the Paſtor may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably gather, not only that he was born in the Church, but that he is indeed a Chriſtian.</q> And there are many Paſſages in the <hi>Confeſſions</hi> of the Proteſtant Churches abroad, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare for a <hi>ſpecial Selection</hi> of thoſe whom they
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:002775_0098_0FE630AEEFD9A628"/>admit unto the <hi>Table of the Lord.</hi> The Churches of <hi>New-England,</hi> have hitherto been thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded; And as the famous <hi>Urſinus</hi> and <hi>Paraeus</hi> have taught them to make this Diſtinction; <hi>Great is the Difference between Baptiſm and the Supper; For Baptiſm is a Sacrament of Entrance, and Reception in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church; but the Supper is a Sacrament of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in the Church, or a Confirmation of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception made before; And Regeneration by the Holy Spirit and Faith, or an Inclination unto Faith and Repentance ſufficeth unto Baptiſm; but in the Supper, it required that they ſhew forth the Lord's Death, and Examine themſelves, whether they have Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;</hi> Thus a famous Divine of their own, Mr. <hi>Thomas Hooker,</hi> has thus expreſſed their Senſe;
<q>Baptiſm is the Entrance into Chriſt's Family; There is much more to be looked at, to make a Perſon capable of the Supper of the Lord; A Man muſt be able to Examine himſelf; He muſt not only have Grace, but growth of Grace, — ſo much — as to ſearch his own Heart; and he muſt be able to Diſcern the Lord's Body.</q> If it ſhould be imagined, That I do the part of an <hi>Advocate,</hi> rather than of an <hi>Hiſtorian,</hi> in this Paragraph, Satisfaction may be had from Reading the <hi>Fourth</hi> of the <hi>Seven</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Propoſitions,</hi> concluded by a Synod of our Churches;
<q>Adult Perſons are not therefore to be admitted into full Communion, meerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are and continue Members, [<hi>being Baptiſed in their Infancy</hi>] without ſuch further Qualifications as the Word of GOD requireth thereunto.</q> And from Reading the large De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence thereof compoſed by Mr. <hi>Richard Mother</hi>
                  <pb n="84" facs="unknown:002775_0099_0FE63187EC6E5038"/>and Mr. <hi>Jonathan Mitchel,</hi> and approved by no ſmall Aſſembly of the <hi>New Engliſh</hi> Miniſters.</p>
               <p>And yet, it muſt be acknowledged, that a great Part of our Paſtors, even of thoſe who can <hi>Baptiſe</hi> upon the Qualifications of the <hi>Synod,</hi> own, they can't ſee why any Adult Perſon ſhould be received into the Covenant of GOD and of Grace, to obtain <hi>Baptiſm</hi> for themſelves or theirs, of whom they cannot ſay, <hi>They</hi> ſhall immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be welcome to the <hi>Table</hi> of the Lord, if they deſire it; and that it muſt be owing unto their <hi>own declining</hi> an immediate Approach unto the Holy and Aweful Table, if it be denied unto them. All turns upon a <hi>Viſible Converſion to ſerious PIETY.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 2. Accordingly, the Uſages of theſe <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Churches, may be truly reported in the Words uſed by <hi>Origen</hi> concerning the Primitive;
<q>After thoſe that are converted, make ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency that they appear to be ſanctified by the Divine Word, and unto the utmoſt of their Power live in a better Manner, then at length we call them to our Myſteries.</q> Or in thoſe Words with which that Father Vindicates thoſe Churches from the Reproaches of <hi>Celſus,</hi> about the Qualification of their Communicants; <hi>The Chriſtians do</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Indeed there is a <hi>Variety</hi> both of <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> in the Churches of <hi>New-England</hi> upon this Matter; However it produces no trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome <hi>Variance</hi> or <hi>Contention</hi> among them.</p>

                  <pb n="85" facs="unknown:002775_0100_0FE63166F971A870"/>
Some eminent <hi>Paſtors</hi> (and ſome of their Churches) are of the Apprehenſion;
<q>That the <hi>Terms of Communion</hi> are an Ordinance of Chriſt, and muſt have a Word of <hi>Inſtitution</hi> to Warrant them. And according to the Goſpel, <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxy</hi> in the <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of the Truths of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Religion, under which is comprized a <hi>Knowledge</hi> of theſe Truths, and this attended with a <hi>Converſation that becomes the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> is that which is the Ground of reputing them to be <hi>Believers,</hi> and Receiving them into our <hi>Fellowſhip;</hi> and whatſoever more is requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a <hi>Teſt,</hi> is <hi>Supra Statutum.</hi> Yet there are ſome things, which though not regularly <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,</hi> may without Sin be Complied withal.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Others apprehend, That nothing ſhort of a Probable and Credible Profeſſion of a <hi>Juſtifying Faith,</hi> qualifies for the <hi>Euchariſt;</hi> where the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of <hi>that Faith</hi> are ſealed unto us: And, That in many a Man, of a <hi>Converſation</hi> free from Vice in the Opinion of the Neighbours, a good <hi>Examination</hi> may render it not <hi>probable</hi> and <hi>credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> unto a <hi>Rational Charity,</hi> that he has yet attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto a <hi>Juſtifying Faith.</hi> And, that therefore the <hi>Candidates</hi> of the Communion ſhould be <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined,</hi> not only about their <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and their <hi>Belief,</hi> and a <hi>Converſation</hi> free from Scandal, but alſo about their <hi>Experimental Piety.</hi> Becauſe it appears unto them the Law of Chriſt, That <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants</hi> at the Table of the Lord, ſhould be ſuch as can and will <hi>Examine themſelves;</hi> The Paſtors thus perſwaded, that they may do the part of <hi>Porters</hi> to the Houſe of GOD, <hi>Examine</hi>

               <p>In very many of the Churches, the <hi>Anſwers</hi> of the <hi>Examined Perſon</hi> to ſome ſuch <hi>Queſtions</hi> as thoſe, are taken in Writing by the <hi>Paſtor</hi> from the Mouth of the Perſon; [or a Brief <hi>Relation</hi> of the Deſires to <hi>live unto GOD</hi> which are now working in hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Heart, and of the <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Ways</hi> wherewith ſuch Deſires have been enkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in him;] or elſe 'tis brought ready written, by the Candidate of the Communion; and unto it there is added, either a <hi>Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> of the Perſons own compoſing, or a briefer Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what publickly received <hi>Confeſſion</hi> or <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm,</hi> he chuſes to acknowledge as containing the <hi>Principles of Religion,</hi> he would adhere unto. This Inſtrument the <hi>Paſtor</hi> communicates unto <hi>Church,</hi> on ſome Convenient Opportunities: But ſometimes he reports to the Brethren the <hi>Minutes</hi>
                  <pb n="89" facs="unknown:002775_0104_0FE630C6A370FB98"/>of the Satisfaction he has received from the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who is now offered unto the Communion, without the Formality of an <hi>Addreſs</hi> in the Name of the Perſon unto them, only ſaying, <hi>On my Inquiry he informs me</hi> ſo and ſo. 'Tis thus eſpecially, when ſome Godly <hi>Scotchmen,</hi> who have ſcrupled the Modes of the <hi>New Engliſh Relations,</hi> have asked an Admiſſion to the Communion. The Circumſtances of <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>Place,</hi> and <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickneſs</hi> for theſe Matters, in the ſeveral Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are very Various; and left unto their own <hi>Diſcretion.</hi> And there is now generally a great <hi>Relaxation</hi> of ſeveral <hi>Severities,</hi> in the Modes of theſe Matters, formerly required in ſome of the Churches. For indeed, on this Occaſion one may uſe the Words of the Roman Hiſtorian, <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit antiquus Rigor, et Nimia Severitas, cui jam non pares ſumus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 3. The Apprehenſion that appears to govern the Churches of <hi>New-England,</hi> is, That be a <hi>Church-State</hi> never ſo ſpecious, it will be but a <hi>Dead Carcaſe</hi> in the Eyes of the Everliving GOD, yea, the Holy One will ſay, <hi>Bury it out of my Sight,</hi> if there be not real and vital <hi>Piety</hi> animat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. The Church is not the <hi>King's Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> nor is there any true <hi>Glory</hi> belonging to her, if ſhe be not <hi>all Glorious within,</hi> by an heavenly <hi>Piety</hi> Diſpoſing and Adorning of her; The <hi>Piety,</hi> which lies in <hi>living</hi> to GOD, and <hi>by the Faith of the Son of GOD,</hi> and paying the conſtant Homage of our Souls unto Him, and <hi>Loving our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> and expreſſing that <hi>Love</hi> to the Life, in a continual Endeavour to <hi>do as we would be done unto.</hi> As this is the trueſt and only <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> ſo
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:002775_0105_0FE630C6A76791F8"/>'tis the trueſt and only <hi>Baſis</hi> for an <hi>Union</hi> in the Churches of GOD. Accordingly 'tis the Deſign of theſe Churches, to make the <hi>Terms of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> run as Parallel as may be with the <hi>Terms of Salvation;</hi> and exclude none from their ſacred Fellowſhip, who <hi>have truely their Fellowſhip with the Father, and with His Son Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all that our SAVIOUR will <hi>Receive unto the Glory of GOD.</hi> If any of the Churches inſiſt on any little <hi>Modalities</hi> in their <hi>Admiſſions,</hi> they are all with an Eye the neceſſary Qualifications of the moſt <hi>Subſtantial PIETY;</hi> and it is to be hoped, they will be <hi>ſoftened</hi> and <hi>ordered,</hi> and on Occaſions <hi>Varied</hi> accordingly.</p>
               <p>A Charitable Conſideration of nothing but PIETY in admitting to Evangelical Priviledges, is a Glory that the Churches of <hi>New-England,</hi> would lay claim unto; Churches of which one of their Paſtors once gave this Account unto his Correſpondents in the <hi>Lower Saxony; Quod ſe nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis Communionis Conditionibus, niſiquae ſint et Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis cum Chriſto, Aeternaeque Salutis Conditiones, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tringant. Cunctos ad Dei Gloriam a Chriſto admiſſos, ad ſacram cum ipſis Euchariſtiam, et ad omnia Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtica Privilegia fatentur admittendos. Calviniſtae ſunt qui Lutherranos; Presbyteriani qui Epiſcopales; Poedobaptiſtae qui Antipaedobaptiſtas, modo ſincera in illis Pietas reſplendeat, et ſi manifeſto Deum timeant, Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiamque operentur, benigniſſime amplexantur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 4. Before the Perſons who have thus pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately addreſſed the <hi>Paſtor</hi> for Admiſſion into the Church, are publickly admitted, he propounds their <hi>Names</hi> unto the Congregation, with an
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:002775_0106_0FE630CC5839D7E0"/>Intimation of what they have deſired. He takes his Time to <hi>Read</hi> or <hi>Tell</hi> unto the <hi>Church,</hi> (and ſometimes as many of the <hi>mixed Aſſembly</hi> as pleaſe, are allowed alſo to ſtay,) what he judges proper of the <hi>Examination,</hi> which has been taken of their Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Diſpoſitions</hi> or <hi>Experiences;</hi> Adding, that he has received an Incouraging Teſtimony of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</p>
               <p>The Candidates of the Communion, at the proper time for it, ſtanding forth, now the Paſtor calls upon the <hi>Brethren</hi> of the Church, to ſignify their Conſent unto the Admiſſion of theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons unto their Communion, by <hi>lifting up their Hands;</hi> [For in all theſe Points, their <hi>Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> is not unlike the Government reported by <hi>Plato</hi> to have been ſometimes in <hi>Athens,</hi> which <hi>Grotius</hi> alſo tells us was the Government of the Primitive Churches; ΑΡΙΣΤΟΚΡΑΤΙΑ ΜΕΤΑ ΕΥΔΟΚΙΑΣ ΤΟΥ ΠΛΗΘΟΥΣ. <hi>An Ariſtocracy order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things with the good liking of the People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being ſignified, the <hi>Paſtor</hi> then applies himſelf unto the <hi>Candidates,</hi> after ſome ſuch Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the Fear of GOD, you are now to attend unto His moſt Gracious COVENANT; and may you by the Help of His Grace, give a moſt hearty Conſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>You do now ſincerely and very ſolemnly give up your ſelves unto the Glorious GOD, who is the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and receive Him as your GOD and Portion; Deſiring to live unto Him. You do give up your ſelves unto the Lord JESUS
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:002775_0107_0FE630CC5C1721B0"/>CHRIST, who is GOD manifeſt in Fleſh, as unto the Head of His Choſen People, and receive Him as made of GOD unto you, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Righteouſneſs, and Holineſs, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. You do likewiſe give your ſelves unto this Church of His; engaging with His Help, in the Communion thereof, to attend upon the Ordinances of the Goſpel, while your Opportunities to be thereby Edified in your moſt Holy Faith ſhall here be continued unto you.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They</hi> by a proper Action ſhewing their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent hereunto; he adds;</p>
               <p>
                  <q>We then the Church of our SAVIOUR in this Place, do receive you into our ſacred Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, and promiſe that by His Aſſiſtence, we will treat you with ſuch Affection and Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, as your ſacred Relation unto us now calleth for. This we do, imploring of our Lord, that both we and you, may obtain Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to be faithful in His Covenant, and Glorify Him with the Holineſs that becomes his Houſe forever.</q>
               </p>
               <p>A brief <hi>Prayer,</hi> wherein <hi>Thanks</hi> are given for the Goſpel and the Succeſs of it, and a <hi>Bleſſing</hi> is implored on the Church, and on thoſe who now ask to be added thereto, and on others that may ask to be added, has been thought proper on theſe Occaſions: Either at the Time of their <hi>Admiſſion;</hi> or at the Time when their <hi>Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> for it, are exhibited.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Paſtor</hi> having thus propounded the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> unto the Candidates, oftentimes makes a ſhort Monitory Speech unto them; and perhaps
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:002775_0108_0FE630CD63BDC3D8"/>recommends to them a Paſſage of the <hi>Divine Oracles,</hi> which he would have them all their Days to think upon.</p>
               <p>The Perſons are after this reputed <hi>Brethren</hi> of the Church, capable of <hi>Occaſional Communion</hi> with any other alſo, wherever they may ſee Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to deſire it.</p>
               <p>And they who from the State of <hi>Diſciples,</hi> thus paſs into the State of <hi>Brethren,</hi> are the only Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for whoſe <hi>formal Votes,</hi> the Paſtors do call in managing any Part of the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know not whether it will do the Part of an Effectual <hi>Apology,</hi> for the ſtrictneſs of theſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the Churches of <hi>New-England:</hi> But I will here obſerve, That it has been a Propoſal made by ſome Conformable Divines, in the <hi>Church of England;</hi>
                  <q>Would it not very much conduce unto the Glory of GOD, and the Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the People in their moſt Holy Faith, if every Perſon Baptiſed into the Chriſtian Faith ſhould be obliged, when he comes unto Years Diſcretion, to appear in the Public Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there to make a Confeſſion of his Faith, and recognize his Primitive Engagement; and that the Miniſter ſhould recommend the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon unto the Grace of GOD, that he may be eſtabliſhed, and perſevere, and continue for ever?</q> Yea, there have lately been in the City of <hi>London,</hi> many <hi>Religious Societies,</hi> living in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Rites of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> whereof the Relater ſays;
<q>It is required of ſuch as join to them, that they give the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty a ſolemn Account of their Senſe of Spiritual Things, with the real Motives, which lead them
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:002775_0109_0FE630CD688C6EA0"/>to this Undertaking, and what they ſeriouſly Purpoſe as to their future Life. This is many times done in Writing, — penned with ſuch an honeſt, affectionate, and undiſguiſed Style, with ſuch pious and ſenſible Expreſſions, and in ſo modeſt and humble a Manner, that they would mightily affect any pious Perſon to read them, and move him to break forth into Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic Praiſes to GOD, who has given ſuch Grace to Young Men in ſo degenerate an Age.</q> Theſe <hi>Religious Societies</hi> have ſtrict <hi>Orders</hi> among them, relating to a holy Life, and an <hi>Exemplary ſtrictneſs</hi> of Converſation; To which every Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, after Mature Deliberation ſubſcribes his <hi>Name,</hi> with his Reſolutions to live up unto them. The Churches of <hi>New-England</hi> will not certainly be blamed <hi>After this!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 5. We are not Inſenſible, That in the Fourth and Fifth Ages of the <hi>Primitive Chriſtianity,</hi> it was counted an heinous Crime, to publiſh the <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Rites</hi> uſed in the <hi>Sacraments;</hi> Yea, they counted it a ſort of <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> and worthy, <hi>Prolixiori Anathemate.</hi> Nor did they think, as <hi>Baſil</hi> intimates, That they could be called <hi>Myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,</hi> if they were <hi>Expoſed unto common and vulgar Notice.</hi> None of the
ΑΜΥΗΤΟΙ might be preſent at theſe <hi>Devotions;</hi> They ſecluded the <hi>Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi> from them; They declined all Recital of them in their <hi>Sermons</hi> to a Promiſcuous Auditory, cutting off with ſuch an <hi>Apoſiopeſis,</hi> as, <hi>nerunt Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deles.</hi> To <hi>write</hi> them, was reckoned unlawful, They were <hi>Myſteria Chartis non Committenda;</hi> They were ΑΡΡΗΤΑ, and ΑΓΡΑΦΑ, Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:002775_0110_0FE630D479A67410"/>I would now paſs on, boldly and freely to deſcribe the ΕΣΩΤΕΡΙΚΑ, the moſt <hi>Sacred,</hi> and moſt <hi>Secret,</hi> of the Tranſactions in the <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> of <hi>New-England;</hi> Believing that the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of old in their great <hi>Reſervations,</hi> too much accommodated themſelves unto the <hi>Pagans;</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom (as <hi>Juſtin</hi> tells us) <hi>Myſteria enunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſe,</hi> was a grievous <hi>Crime;</hi> and ſome tell us of thoſe who <hi>died</hi> for it.</p>
               <p>The Churches, like the <hi>Primitive,</hi> have no Times univerſally ſtated for their Celebration of the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> Some have it once in <hi>Four</hi> Weeks, ſome in <hi>Six,</hi> ſome in <hi>Eight,</hi> and ſome, the <hi>firſt Lord's Day</hi> in every <hi>Kalender</hi> Month; and ſome the <hi>laſt:</hi> Some in the cloſe of the <hi>Afternoon:</hi> but moſt in the cloſe of the <hi>Forenoon.</hi> And the <hi>Paſtors</hi> likewiſe reſerve to themſelves a Liberty of <hi>Altering</hi> the Times as they judge fit upon Emergencies.</p>
               <p>The Churches do generally ſee no Neceſſity of taking the <hi>Evening</hi> for the <hi>only Time</hi> of Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating the <hi>Lord's Supper.</hi> For though it be called by the Name of ΔΕΙΠΝΟΝ, 'tis well known, that in the Ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Authors, as Ancient as <hi>Homer</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the Word is uſed for a <hi>Dinner,</hi> for a <hi>Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt,</hi> for any <hi>Eating,</hi> as well as for a <hi>Supper.</hi> And <hi>Coena,</hi> which is the Term that Anſwers it in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi> ſignifies any <hi>Eating in Common.</hi> Yea, the Engliſh Word <hi>Supper</hi> does not neceſſarily imply <hi>Night-Eating;</hi> The <hi>laſt Meal</hi> in the Day is a <hi>Supper,</hi> though it be ſeveral Hours before <hi>Night;</hi> and the Word being derived from SOPPE (which is <hi>Bread</hi> that is dipped in ſome <hi>Liquid thing</hi>) the <hi>Diet</hi> rather than the <hi>Seaſon</hi> of Eating, is therein
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:002775_0111_0FE630D4CD6E9940"/>intimated. Wherefore the Churches do generally count themſelves obliged no more to the <hi>Time</hi> of <hi>Night</hi> for the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> than to the <hi>Place</hi> of an <hi>Upper Chamber</hi> for it, or the Number <hi>Twelve</hi> of the <hi>Communicants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, though <hi>Tertullian</hi> mentions the Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> as being <hi>Tempore Victus,</hi> or at <hi>Supper-time;</hi> From which time of their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling, the Heathen probably took Occaſion to accuſe them of putting out their <hi>Lights,</hi> and then doing unknown Deeds of <hi>Darkneſs;</hi> yet the ſame <hi>Tertullian</hi> mentions the Celebration of the Sacrament alſo <hi>Antelucanis Caetibus,</hi> or in the <hi>Morning</hi> before break of Day; and the Pagan <hi>Pliny</hi> confirms the Report. <hi>Cyprian</hi> likewiſe mentions the Adminiſtration of it, both in the <hi>Evening</hi> and the <hi>Morning.</hi> It ſeems every Church then did, in this Matter, what beſt ſuited their own particular Circumſtances.</p>
               <p>When the LORD's SUPPER is to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred, the <hi>Paſtor</hi> gives Notice of it a Week be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand. And when the <hi>Lord's Day</hi> for it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives, he uſually accomodates the ſolemn Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before him, with a Sermon upon ſome agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Doctrine of the Goſpel.</hi> In moſt Places there are held <hi>private Meetings</hi> of the Chriſtians, on ſome Day of the Week, <hi>Preparatory</hi> to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; and it is a frequent thing for the Paſtor to be preſent at ſome or other of them; or elſe perhaps to hold a <hi>Publick Lecture.</hi> But now on the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> the Ordinary Exerciſes being fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, the Reſt of the Aſſembly are diſmiſſed, except any devout Perſons, who ſtay ſcattered
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:002775_0112_0FE630D68EA76B48"/>here and there, at ſome Diſtance from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants, to be <hi>Spectators</hi> of the <hi>Myſteries.</hi> The <hi>Communicants</hi> now ſeating themſelves together in the Body of the Meeting Houſe, the <hi>Paſtor</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends from the <hi>Pulpit</hi> unto the <hi>Table,</hi> which now ſtands furniſhed with the <hi>Sacramental Elements,</hi> before the <hi>Seat,</hi> uſually deſigned for the <hi>Deacons,</hi> in the Sight of all the <hi>Communicants,</hi> and the <hi>Deacons</hi> do ſtand waiting before it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Paſtor</hi> having firſt mentioned the <hi>Names</hi> of the Perſons (if there be any ſuch) belonging to <hi>other Churches,</hi> who requeſt a Part in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Communion, he then addreſſes himſelf with all poſſible Solemnity, unto the Celebration.</p>
               <p>In ſome Churches, there is firſt, as there was in ſome of the Primitive, a <hi>Solita Praedicatio,</hi> or a <hi>Speech</hi> only unto the Communicants, to prepare them for the Action: But this is not in all.</p>
               <p>With a ſhort Paſſage equivalent unto the <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum Corda</hi> of the Ancients, [which, by the Way, confutes <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi>] he beſpeaks their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. But then, either he reads the whole Paragraph, Luk. XXII. 19, 20. Or, 1 Cor. XI. 23, 24, 25, 26. Or elſe, Makes the Recitation by Parcels. Firſt, he ſays, <hi>Our Lord JESUS CHRIST in the Night wherein he was betrayed, took BREAD.</hi> Upon ſo ſaying he touches with his <hi>Hand</hi> the <hi>Loaves</hi> of <hi>Bread</hi> in the <hi>Diſhes,</hi> (or takes the <hi>Diſhes</hi> towards him) now before him, unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, where they were aforehand fitted, eaſily to be <hi>broken</hi> in Pieces.</p>
               <p>He adds; And HE BLESSED it;—where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>Communicants</hi> now ſtanding up, he now poureth out a <hi>Prayer</hi> before the Lord, filled with
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:002775_0113_0FE5F4B6ADD12040"/>the Acknowledgements of the <hi>Evangelical Truths,</hi> which this Inſtitution invites us to think upon; and Supplications for the Divine <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> upon that Part of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> now before them, and upon themſelves in the Receiving of it. I may deſcribe the <hi>Prayer</hi> in the Words of <hi>Juſtin Martyr;</hi>
                  <q>The Miniſter gives Praiſe and Glory to the Lord of all, thro' the Son and the Holy Spirit; and in a large Manner renders particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Thanks for the preſent Mercies; who when he has ended his Prayers and Praiſes, the People ſay, <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Prayer</hi> being finiſhed, the Communicants again ſit down, and the <hi>Paſtor</hi> ſays, <hi>Our Lord JESUS CHRIST having Bleſſed the Bread, He BROKE it.</hi> Whereupon he proceeds to the <hi>Breaking of the Bread,</hi> in the View of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants, who for the moſt Part are ſilently left unto their own <hi>Meditations,</hi> during this Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; though ſome of the Paſtors Excite and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the <hi>Meditations</hi> of the People, by now and then uttering a <hi>Sentence</hi> of the ſacred Scriptures, or of their own Pathetic Thoughts, unto them.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Bread</hi> is all <hi>Broken</hi> into convenient Parcels, he ſays to this Effect: <hi>Our Lord JESUS CHRIST, having broken the Bread, He GAVE IT unto His Diſciples, ſaying, This is my Body which is broken for you, take it, and eat of it, and do it in Remembrance of me. Wherefore in the Name of that Glorious Lord, I now invite you, to TAKE, and EAT hereof; and to do it in Remembrance of Him.</hi> So, He himſelf <hi>Takes</hi> and <hi>Eats</hi> of this <hi>Bread:</hi> But as he <hi>takes</hi> it himſelf, he <hi>gives</hi> the Diſhes unto the
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:002775_0114_0FE630D692802520"/>
                  <hi>Deacons,</hi> by whoſe Help they are handed about among the <hi>Communicants,</hi> until they do all, <hi>ſitting</hi> in a Devout Manner [In the Primitive Times, <hi>Reader,</hi> we are very certain, they did not uſe to do it, <hi>Kneeling!</hi>] <hi>Take</hi> and <hi>Eat</hi> thereof. In <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s Time and Place the <hi>Communicants</hi> did not receive the Elements, <hi>De aliorum Manu quam Praeſidentium:</hi> But in the Churches of <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> they do as in <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi>'s; ΔΙΑΚΟΝΟΙ ΔΙΔΟ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ΑΣΙΝ.
<q>The Deacons give the Conſecrated Bread and Wine to thoſe that are preſent.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Deacons</hi> returning with the Remainders, the <hi>Paſtor</hi> ſtands up, and Enquires, <hi>Whether any to whom that Bread of the Lord, and of Life, ſhould have been given, have not received it?</hi> If a <hi>Sign</hi> of any ſuch be given, 'tis carried unto them. And when all are ſerved, the <hi>Deacons</hi> do then ſit down and partake of their Portion alſo.</p>
               <p>And here one Remark more may be inſerted. In the Primitive Churches, the <hi>Deacons</hi> did moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with their own Hands give the <hi>Bread</hi> unto each of the <hi>Communicants.</hi> Only in the Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> I find it inſinuated by <hi>Clemens A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandrinus,</hi> that each of the <hi>Communicants</hi> there took the <hi>Bread</hi> himſelf out of the Plate when it was conſecrated.

The Communicants thereupon again ſtanding up; he pours out a Prayer, of the like Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, the like Tendency, with the former. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, in the Primitive Churches, there was uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally but <hi>one long Prayer</hi> before the Diſtribution of the <hi>Elements;</hi> which alſo were both of 'em <hi>at once</hi> conſecrated. But in the Churches of <hi>New-England,</hi> ſo far as I am informed, the Paſtor makes <hi>Two Prayers,</hi> a firſt before the Diſtribution of the <hi>Bread,</hi> and then a ſecond before the Diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of the <hi>Wine</hi> in the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then filling out the <hi>Wine</hi> from the <hi>Flagons</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Cups,</hi> [Though the <hi>Pouring out of the Wine</hi> is not properly one of the <hi>Sacramental Actions,</hi> and if there ſtand any <hi>Tankards</hi> on the <hi>Table</hi> ready filled, it is accordingly omitted <hi>there;</hi>] he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to ſpeak unto this Effect, <hi>Our Lord JESUS CHRIST hereupon GAVE the CUP to His Diſciples, ſaying, This Cup is the New Teſtament in my Blood, which is ſhed for you and for many for the Remiſſion of Sins; TAKE it, and all you DRINK of it, and do it in Remembrance of me. Wherefore in the Name of that moſt Gracious Lord, I invite you to TAKE and DRINK hereof, and to do it in Remembrance of Him.</hi> So he himſelf <hi>Takes</hi> and <hi>Drinks</hi> of the <hi>Wine,</hi> and the <hi>Deacons</hi> do Diſpenſe and Diſperſe the <hi>Cups</hi> among the <hi>Communicants;</hi> who ſtill uſing the Table Poſture of <hi>ſitting,</hi> do in a devout Manner <hi>Take</hi> and <hi>Drink</hi> thereof. The <hi>Deacons</hi> return with their emptied Cups unto the <hi>Paſtor,</hi> who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain fills them, till there be no more Occaſion. And when all ſeem to be ſerved he inquires, <hi>Whether any to whom that Cup of the Lord, and of Bleſſing, hen belonged, had been omitted in the Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
                  <pb n="101" facs="unknown:002775_0116_0FE630DC00F22060"/>— The <hi>Deacons</hi> then ſit down and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take as before.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Pſalm</hi> choſe (and in ſome Places read) by the <hi>Paſtor,</hi> is hereupon <hi>Sung</hi> by the <hi>Communicants.</hi> This in the Primitive Churches was uſually done <hi>before the laſt Prayer.</hi> Some of ours do it <hi>after.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Paſtor</hi> now (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſays, <hi>Oratio Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivium dirimit</hi>) paſſes on to a <hi>third Prayer;</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of the moſt Raiſed <hi>Thankſgiving</hi> to GOD, and <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of the Bleſſings in the <hi>New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> ſealed by this Ordinance.

               <head>ARTICLE VI. The <hi>Paſtoral Care</hi> Exerciſed in the more PRIVATE SERVICES of it.</head>
               <p>§. 1. A Paſtor being one that is to <hi>watch for the Souls</hi> of his Flock, <hi>as one that is to give an Account,</hi> there are <hi>Private</hi> as well as <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> Services expected from him; whereof the <hi>firſt</hi> and not the <hi>leaſt,</hi> is that of CATECHIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING.</p>
               <p>The Work of a <hi>Catechiſt</hi> was often a <hi>Diſtinct Office,</hi> in the <hi>Primitive Churches:</hi> But it is rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned incumbent for the moſt Part upon every <hi>Paſtor</hi> in the <hi>New Engliſh:</hi> And there is much <hi>Variety</hi> uſed in the Diſcharge of it.</p>
               <p>Formerly, There were ſeveral Divines in theſe Churches (it were eaſy to reckon more than a <hi>Decemvirate</hi> of them) who, like <hi>Cyril,</hi> and ſome others of the Fathers, compoſed and publiſhed <hi>Catechiſms</hi> of their own, which were deſigned more peculiarly for the Edification of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular People, with whom they were <hi>travail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is not above one or two of thoſe, uſed at this Day. That which is moſt ſo, is the <hi>Milk
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:002775_0119_0FE630E566B98B30"/>for Babes,</hi> which many of our Children have their Inſtruction begun withal. But the <hi>Catechiſm</hi> which now generally obtains is that of the <hi>Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Divines,</hi> (prepared originally by a <hi>Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virate</hi> never to be forgotten, Dr. <hi>Arrowſmith,</hi> Dr. <hi>Tuckney,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Newcomen,</hi>) whereof the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Opinion, is, <hi>That no Man's Reproach can leſſen, and no Man's Applauſe can heighten, the Reputation that belongs unto it.</hi> Albeit there are thoſe alſo, who even in this find ſome <hi>Deficiencies,</hi> and ſome <hi>Redundancies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By ſome of the <hi>Paſtors,</hi> the Work of <hi>Catechiſing,</hi> and the Task of a <hi>Pantaenus,</hi> or an <hi>Origen,</hi> has been done, with a ſpecial Aim and Hope to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Great and Good <hi>Preſervative of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> which has of old been known by the Name of, CONFIRMATION; That is to ſay, when the <hi>Children Baptiſed</hi> in the Churches come to be of Age, the Paſtors do ſend for them, and <hi>Examine</hi> them diſcreetly and faithfully, concerning their <hi>Improvement</hi> in <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and <hi>Converſion</hi> to GOD, and <hi>Reſolutions</hi> for a Life of PIETY, and <hi>Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> to the Remembring and Renewing of their <hi>Baptiſmal Covenant.</hi> Thoſe in whom there are found the Agreeable Symptoms of a <hi>Regenerate Mind,</hi> are adviſed immediately to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for a CONFIRMATION of their <hi>Church-Memberſhip,</hi> in a <hi>full Communion</hi> with the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. Thoſe who are found of a more diſcourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and undeſireable Character, have ſuitable <hi>Admonitions</hi> beſtowed upon them; Until they have hearkened whereunto, they may not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the <hi>Priviledges</hi> of <hi>Adult Members</hi> in the
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:002775_0120_0FE630E56AA4D308"/>Churches of the Lord. But other <hi>Paſtors</hi> have yet their own <hi>Methods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some of the <hi>Paſtors</hi> do on the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> in the <hi>Afternoons,</hi> before the Sermon, make the Young People publickly to Anſwer the <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others of the <hi>Paſtors</hi> do on ſome <hi>Week-Days,</hi> publickly hear their Young People anſwer to the <hi>Catechiſm.</hi> And then they make a ſhort <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> upon one of the <hi>Queſtions.</hi> Or, perhaps upon ſome Text, for the Animation of <hi>Early Piety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are yet others who ſend for the Young People to their Houſes, <hi>numbring</hi> and <hi>ſorting</hi> of them as they think fit; and then, when they have Anſwered the <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> there are Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Perſonal <hi>Admonitions</hi> given unto them, <hi>to Remember their CREATOR in the Days of their Youth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some of the <hi>Paſtors</hi> chuſe to do this Part of their Office after the <hi>Pauline</hi> way, <hi>To teach from Houſe to Houſe.</hi> And perhaps <hi>no way more ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant!</hi> The Paſtor may ſend aforehand unto ſuch <hi>Families</hi> as he intends, an Intimation <hi>that</hi> he intends at ſuch a Time to Viſit them: And coming to the <hi>Families,</hi> he aſſays with as decent and as pungent Addreſſes as he is able, to treat each Perſon particularly about their Everlaſting Intereſts. And unto the <hi>Young People,</hi> he puts Queſtions of the <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> from the Anſwers whereof he makes as lively Applications unto them as he can, for the Engaging of them in the Service of the Lord. No doubt, he ſeldom
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:002775_0121_0FE630E66F08B1F8"/>leaves a <hi>Family,</hi> without many Tears falling from Souls, <hi>deſirous to Fear the Name of GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Paſtors</hi> do ſometimes Imitate the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> of whom we find,
<q>That he would Inculcate Things on his People, with private Communications. And of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who would Go to every one that was committed to his Care, and Exhort them, according to the Miniſtry of the Lord, and of His Goſpel:</q> And of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> whoſe <hi>Private Labours</hi> to inſtruct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> his Flock are celebrated by <hi>Poſidonius.</hi> They are ſenſible of what is Urged by <hi>Proſper,</hi>
                  <q>That <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> are called <hi>Watchmen,</hi> becauſe they ſhould Watch the Actions of all Men, and with an Aim of Religious Curioſity ſpy out, how every one liveth, with his Houſehold in his Houſe: What good Men they approve, they are to Confirm, by Honouring them; whom they obſerve to be Vicious, they are to Amend, by Reproving them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>§. 2. The VISITATION OF THE SICK, (and ſo, of the <hi>Afflicted</hi>) is a Work for which there are <hi>particular Officers,</hi> Men of Piety, and Gravity, and Experience, appointed in ſome Churches of the <hi>Reformation.</hi> And others as well as the Great <hi>Voetius,</hi> make a fair Apology for it.</p>
               <p>But in the Churches of <hi>New-England,</hi> that Work is incumbent on the <hi>Paſtors,</hi> and account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no little Part of the <hi>Paſtoral Care.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>other Afflictions</hi> (as the Loſs of <hi>Deſireable Relatives,</hi> or ſingular <hi>Temptations,</hi> and <hi>Exerciſes</hi>) the <hi>Paſtors</hi> do <hi>Viſit</hi> their People, and ſuit their
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:002775_0122_0FE630E673038E18"/>Diſcourſes unto the Occaſions; and perhaps put ſuitable <hi>Books of Piety</hi> into their Hands. And then they uſually <hi>Pray</hi> with them, that they may carry it well under their <hi>Afflictions,</hi> and that the Holy Ends thereof, may be obtained upon them. Thus particularly they <hi>make the Heart of the Widow to ſing</hi> with the <hi>Joys</hi> of Piety.</p>
               <p>But the SICK are a ſpecial and frequent Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the <hi>Paſtoral Care.</hi> The Paſtors, when the <hi>Sick Perſon</hi> ſends for them (and often with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their ſending, and though they forget their Duty, to <hi>call for the Elders</hi>) have a very <hi>ſerious,</hi> and ſometimes a very <hi>difficult</hi> Work to do. If the <hi>Sick</hi> be capable of <hi>Receiving Inſtruction,</hi> the <hi>Paſtors</hi> now ſet before him, in lively Terms, the <hi>Miſerable State</hi> which by <hi>Sin,</hi> both <hi>Original</hi> and <hi>Actual</hi> he is fallen into: and ſeeing him affected with a Senſe of his <hi>Miſery,</hi> they then as livelily propoſe to him the <hi>Remedy</hi> in a Great SAVIOUR provided for him. In the <hi>Directories</hi> prepared many Ages ago, for the <hi>Viſitation of the Sick,</hi> it was directed that the <hi>Sick</hi> Perſon ſhould ſay, <hi>O my GOD, I now place the Death of my Lord JESUS CHRIST between Thee and my Sins:</hi> Thus our Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors do aſſiſt the <hi>Sick</hi> Perſon, all they can, to place his <hi>Faith</hi> in the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and the <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of a Glorious CHRIST, for Deliverance from <hi>Eternal Death,</hi> as well as <hi>Temporal.</hi> They Tender the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> to him in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Articles of it, and obtain his <hi>Explicit Conſent</hi> unto them all. They repeat the <hi>Calls of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> to him, and they obtain ſuch Anſwers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, as to make it hopeful that they are become <hi>Effectual.</hi> They ſet before him the <hi>very great
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:002775_0123_0FE630ED5DACB5D0"/>and precious Promiſes of GOD</hi> unto returning Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and eſpecially ſuch Words of a Merciful SAVIOUR as that [worth a Thouſand Worlds!] <hi>Himthat cometh unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> They go through a <hi>Proceſs of Repentance</hi> with him; Urging him to look upon the <hi>Sins</hi> of his <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> with a due <hi>Contrition</hi> for them; to make the Flight of a Diſtreſſed Soul unto the <hi>Open Fountain</hi> for the <hi>Forgiveneſs</hi> of them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to reſign up his Mind unto the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> that he may be made a <hi>new Creature,</hi> and be brought into the <hi>Life of GOD.</hi> And that <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> may have its <hi>perfect Work</hi> (if they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend Occaſion for it) they <hi>exhort</hi> him, That if he have <hi>wronged</hi> any Neighbour either in his <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate</hi> or his <hi>Eſteem,</hi> he would now make him all poſſible <hi>Reparation;</hi> Or, That if he has had any <hi>Companions in Impicty,</hi> he would now give his faithful <hi>Warnings</hi> and <hi>Rebukes</hi> unto them. If the Patient has been of <hi>Conſpicuous Piety,</hi> they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him with the beſt Views they can give him of the <hi>Heavenly World,</hi> of which he is now upon the Borders, and of the <hi>Reſt which remains for the People of GOD.</hi> Finally, A Profound <hi>Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Will of GOD,</hi> is recommended as what He is <hi>well pleaſed withal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When theſe things are done, as far as there is Opportunity for them, the <hi>Paſtors</hi> proceed unto their <hi>Prayers,</hi> wherein ſuch Purpoſes as theſe are Conſidered and Proſecuted.</p>
               <p>The Glorious GOD, who is the <hi>Father of Mercies,</hi> and our moſt Merciful Father in our Lord JESUS CHRIST, is acknowledged as
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:002775_0124_0FE630ED63DCE880"/>commanding us to <hi>Love one another,</hi> and with a Spirit of Love to <hi>Pray for one another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Providence</hi> of GOD our <hi>Maker,</hi> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged as ordering the Condition of the Sick Perſon, and as <hi>performing the Thing that is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for us,</hi> in all Occurrences.</p>
               <p>GOD is adored as <hi>Wounding,</hi> and as <hi>Healing,</hi> as <hi>Killing,</hi> and as <hi>Quickening,</hi> and as the <hi>Sovereign</hi> GOD before whom we are as the <hi>Clay before the Potter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>— Adored as a <hi>Righteous</hi> GOD, unto whoſe <hi>Juſtice</hi> we have by our Sins ſorfeited our <hi>Lives,</hi> and all the Comforts of them.</p>
               <p>— Adored as a <hi>Gracious</hi> GOD, and one <hi>ready to pardon;</hi> and having in the Mediation of the Great SAVIOUR provided an admirable Way ſor His <hi>Pardoning Mercy</hi> to reach unto us.</p>
               <p>The Application of this <hi>Mercy,</hi> with the <hi>Blood</hi> in which it flows down, unto the Soul of the Sick Perſon, is then implored. And it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore asked, that he may with a <hi>Repenting Soul,</hi> bewail all the <hi>Errors</hi> of his <hi>Life;</hi> all his Forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of GOD, and of the <hi>Errand</hi> which GOD ſent him into the World upon; all his Violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Divine <hi>Laws,</hi> and of his own <hi>Vows;</hi> all his <hi>Neglect</hi> of the <hi>Great Salvation;</hi> all his <hi>Miſimprovements</hi> under Means of Good; all his <hi>Miſbehaviours</hi> in all <hi>Conditions,</hi> and all <hi>Relations,</hi> and all <hi>Employments;</hi> and above all that he may lay to <hi>Heart</hi> the <hi>Fountain of Sin</hi> in his <hi>Heart,</hi> which he brought into the World with him.</p>
               <p>It is hereupon asked, That with a lively <hi>Faith,</hi> he may be helped from above to make the
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:002775_0125_0FE630EF1DB22C40"/>

But that he may be <hi>made willing</hi> at the ſame Time to ſubmit unto the <hi>Spirit of Grace,</hi> and all His <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Operations;</hi> and that he may accordingly have the Experience thereof, quickening him to <hi>Turn</hi> and <hi>Live</hi> unto GOD; and that the <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Work</hi> of the Holy Spirit upon his Mind, may prove a Real, Thorough, Saving Work, and an <hi>Hope that will not make aſhamed;</hi> and that the preſent Circumſtances of the Sick Perſon may contribute unto it.</p>
               <p>It is then prayed, That his <hi>Health</hi> may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, and his <hi>Life</hi> prolonged; and that he may come out of his preſent Illneſs as <hi>Gold out of the Fire.</hi> But that if he muſt now be called out of this World, he may go away with all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible <hi>Reſignation</hi> to the Will of GOD, and <hi>finiſh well,</hi> and go chearfully through the <hi>Valley of the Shadow of Death,</hi> and be <hi>preſented Faultleſs before the preſence of His Glory with Exceeding Joy.</hi>

               <p>Hereupon ſuitable Mercies are alſo asked for the <hi>Relatives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it is asked for the <hi>By ſtanders,</hi> that all may be duely affected with a Senſe of our <hi>Frailty,</hi> and ſpeedily get into good Terms with Heaven, and leave <hi>nothing undone,</hi> that Men will wiſh to have done, when the Dying Hour comes upon them.</p>
               <p>If they be <hi>Sick Children</hi> that are prayed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, Pains are taken, in the firſt Place, to diſpoſe

And then the Prayer takes Notice of certain peculiar and adapted Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</p>
               <p>It owns the <hi>Providence</hi> of GOD, without which not a <hi>Bird of the Air falls to the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It bewails the ſad Effects of <hi>Original Sin,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in the Miſeries that attend us, even from our moſt <hi>Early Infancy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It prays for the <hi>Recovery</hi> of the Child: But that if the Child be to Die, it may yet have a Soul ſprinkled with the <hi>Blood</hi> of the <hi>Lumb of GOD,</hi> and <hi>bound up in the Bundle of Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It puts the Child into the Hands of the Great SAVIOUR, that <hi>good Shepherd,</hi> who hath ſaid, <hi>Suffer little Children to come unto me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It intreats for the <hi>Parents,</hi> the Graces proper for the Occaſion, eſpecially the <hi>Repentance</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> thus <hi>brought unto Remembrance;</hi> and a ſenſible Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement in all <hi>Piety;</hi> with a Part in a Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous CHRIST, which will abundantly make up all their Loſſes.</p>
               <p>§. 3. Though the Churches of <hi>New-England,</hi> have with other Churches of the Reformation, ſufficiently renounced the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Notion of the <hi>ſeven Sacraments;</hi> nor have they any <hi>Spiritual Courts</hi> for the Trial of <hi>Matrimonial Cauſes;</hi> yet the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of a MARRIAGE in them, is now ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally performed by their <hi>Paſtors.</hi> For many Years after the firſt Settlement of theſe Colonies, a <hi>Marriage</hi> was ever celebrated by the <hi>Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate;</hi> who not only gave the <hi>Marriage Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>

               <p>In former Times our <hi>People,</hi> in Conformity to the Uſages in the Ancient Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and what have been continued in ſome Churches of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> maintained a Solemnity, called a <hi>Contraction,</hi> a little before the Conſummation of a <hi>Marriage</hi> was allowed of.

               <p>The <hi>Weddings</hi> of <hi>New-England</hi> are for the moſt part celebrated with leſs of <hi>public Appearance</hi> than they are in ſome other Countrys; by which 'tis thought that many <hi>Inconveniencies</hi> are <hi>avoided.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Paſtor</hi> begins with a <hi>Prayer</hi> which turns upon ſuch Articles as theſe.</p>
               <p>The Glorious GOD is acknowledged as the Giver of every <hi>Good Gift;</hi> The Extent of His <hi>Providence,</hi> and a <hi>Providence</hi> too under the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of our <hi>Mediator</hi> JESUS, is conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; —</p>
               <p>In all the Good that is done for us the Sovereign <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of our GOD is confeſſed; And our SAVIOUR by His Blood purchaſing for us the <hi>Bleſſings of Goodneſs,</hi> whereof our Sins have made a Forfeiture.</p>
               <p>It is deſired, That our Bleſſings may prove <hi>Bleſſings indeed</hi> unto us, and aſſiſt us in the Service of GOD.</p>
               <p>The Goodneſs of GOD in appointing the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried State</hi> is adored; — and His <hi>Providence</hi> in
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:002775_0129_0FE630F7453E58A0"/>chuſing the <hi>Relatives</hi> which He therein gives to each other, is admired.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Dependence</hi> on the <hi>Providence</hi> of GOD our SAVIOUR, for our <hi>Welfare</hi> in the <hi>Married</hi> (as well as in every other) <hi>State</hi> is expreſſed.</p>
               <p>For the enſuring of ſuch a <hi>Welfare</hi> there is an Eye had unto the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> wherein <hi>our Maker is our Husband,</hi> and our SAVIOUR is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to <hi>Eſpouſe</hi> us unto Himſelf in <hi>Faithfulneſs for ever.</hi> The marvellous Condeſcention of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious LORD in the Propoſal of ſuch an <hi>Eſpouſal,</hi> is wondred at; The <hi>Enmity</hi> of our <hi>Carnal Minds</hi> againſt this Bleſſedneſs is deprecated; And pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Expreſſions of a <hi>Conſent</hi> unto the Gracious <hi>Propoſal,</hi> are then endeavoured.</p>
               <p>That Promiſe of the Covenant, for <hi>all Things to Work together for Good</hi> is now laid hold upon; and it is asked, That as our <hi>Sorrows</hi> may make us Wiſer and Better, ſo our <hi>Comforts</hi> may quicken us to Glorify our GOD, in a Life of Obedience unto Him.</p>
               <p>It is more particularly asked, on the behalf of the Perſons who are now entring into the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> of the <hi>Married State,</hi> That they may now firſt <hi>give themſelves unto the Lord,</hi> and have the <hi>Pardon</hi> of all their Sins through the Blood of the <hi>Great Sacrifice,</hi> and that ſo the Bleſſing of GOD may be upon them in their now <hi>giving themſelves to each other,</hi> according to His Inſtitution.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Prayer</hi> being finiſhed, he now ſays to the Couple before him;</p>
               <p>
                  <q>You are now to attend unto a Covenant of GOD; the Covenant of your Marriage before Him. —</q>

                  <q>Give therefore your Hands, with your Hearts, unto one another. —</q>
               </p>
               <p>This being done, he addreſſes the <hi>Man,</hi> to this Effect: —
<q>The Perſon whom you now take by the Hand, you take to be your Wedded Wiſe; Depending on the Grace of Heaven, you promiſe to Love her, to Honour her, to Support her; and to treat her in that Relation, as it becomes a Profeſſor of the Glorious Goſpel of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, ſo long as you live both together in this World. This Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe you make as in the Preſence of GOD, and before theſe Witneſſes —</q>

               <p>And then, the <hi>Woman:</hi> —
<q>The Perſon whom you now take by the Hand, you take to be your Wedded Husband: With Dependence on the Grace of Heaven, you promiſe to Love him, to Honour him, to Obey him, and to Treat him with a Behaviour, that may Anſwer and Adorn the Doctrine of GOD your SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR, ſo long as you both live together in this World. This Promiſe you make as in the Preſence of the Great GOD, and before theſe Witneſſes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Conſent</hi> unto this <hi>Covenant,</hi> being ſome way ſignified, he adds, —</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I then declare you to be Married, according to the Laws of GOD, and of this Province. And what GOD has joined, Man may not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate.</q>

               <p>In former Ages there was, and ſtill in other Places, there is, much Streſs laid upon the <hi>Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Ring.</hi> In the <hi>Roman Ritual,</hi> there is a Form of <hi>Benediction</hi> uſed by the Prieſt upon it. The

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Paſtor</hi> now proceeds unto another <hi>Prayer;</hi> wherein, — The <hi>Honour</hi> which GOD has put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Marriage</hi> by His Inſtituting of it in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and the Preſence and Favour of our Great SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR once Working a <hi>Miracle</hi> at it, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered. — The Grace to carry it well in all <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> is asked for; and particularly for the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons now <hi>Married, — That</hi> their <hi>Behaviour</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards each other may be full of that <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> which may be a lively and lovely Emblem, of of what paſſes between the Lord JESUS CHRIST and His Church; — <hi>That</hi> they may be ſuch <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings</hi> to each other, as that they may have Cauſe every Day to give Thanks unto GOD for giving them to one another; <hi>That</hi> all the Bleſſings of the <hi>Married State</hi> which are to be deſired and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, may be beſtowed upon them; — Above all. <hi>That</hi> they may be bleſſed with <hi>Spiritual Bleſſings;</hi> &amp; their <hi>Family</hi> may prove a <hi>Religious Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> and an Houſe wherein the Religion of GOD our SAVIOUR ſhall be carried on with <hi>Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Sacrifices; That</hi> our Lord would help them to <hi>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If they be any of them (which <hi>rarely</hi> if <hi>ever</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens) Perſons againſt whom <hi>he</hi> hath an Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that cannot eaſily be removed, he adviſes them to <hi>another Choice.</hi> But if he hath nothing to object, he applies himſelf unto the Perſons choſen, with this Requeſt, That they would ſo far ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the <hi>Call</hi> of the Church, as to do the <hi>Work</hi>
                  <pb n="131" facs="unknown:002775_0146_0FE63117A8516D28"/>expected from the <hi>Deacons,</hi> until ſuch Time, as the Church may proceed, unto the full Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Apoſtolical Direction, <hi>Let the Deacons firſt be proved; then let them uſe the Office of a Deacon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It has been obſerved, That becauſe in our Tranſlation, it is enumerated among the Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of a <hi>Deacon.</hi> [1 Tim. III. 2.] <hi>Even ſo muſt their Wives be grave, not Slanderers, ſober, faithful in all things:</hi> And the <hi>French</hi> Churches therefore make it an Article of their Diſcipline,
<q>That as much as poſſible may be avoided, there ſhould not be elected Elders and Deacons of the Church, thoſe which had Wives contrary to the true Religion</q>: When <hi>Deacons</hi> are choſen in the Churches, 'tis often enquired, Whether their <hi>Wives</hi> are qualified as has been directed? But this has been from a common Miſtake about the Meaning of the Text; which does not ſay a Word about the <hi>Deacons Wife,</hi> any more than the <hi>Paſtors,</hi> but only ſays, <hi>Let the Women</hi> [ΓΥΝΑΙΚΕΣ] <hi>be Grave.</hi> — Which <hi>Women</hi> are the <hi>Deaconeſſes;</hi> Officers not hitherto employed in the Churches of <hi>New-England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Deacons Elect,</hi> when they have in a Lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Behaviour, for ſome time given Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their <hi>Ability,</hi> and <hi>Fidelity,</hi> do in ſome of the Churches become <hi>Deacons Ordained</hi> with <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Hands.</hi> Though in many of theſe Churches, This <hi>Rite</hi> of their Confirmation, is fallen into ſuch a Deſuetude, as it is in other Churches of the <hi>Reformation.</hi> One Reaſon for this Omiſſion, has been becauſe in many of our Churches, the <hi>Deacons</hi> do little other Work, than
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:002775_0147_0FE6311E4678EBE0"/>provide the <hi>Elements</hi> for the <hi>Euchariſt;</hi> and a <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Ordination</hi> to nothing but <hi>this,</hi> appears hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Congruity. But when an <hi>Ordination</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, ſome <hi>Lord's Day</hi> (or <hi>Faſt Day</hi>) being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſignified by the Paſtor for the Purpoſe, when the Day arrives the Paſtor makes the <hi>Conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of this Affair, to be among the other Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of the Day. He declares, that by the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches <hi>Deſignation,</hi> ſuch and ſuch Perſons are now to be <hi>confirmed</hi> in the Office of <hi>Deacons,</hi> if there now appear nothing to obſtruct it. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore propoſes unto the Brethren of the Church, [ſuppoſe <hi>Two</hi> to be now concerned:] <hi>That if they do ſtill maintain and will now renew, their Choice of the Two Beloved Brethren,</hi> A. B. and C. D. <hi>to the Office of</hi> Deacons <hi>in the Church, their uplifted Hands may ſignify it.</hi> This being done, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes himſelf unto the Perſons choſen; deſiring them to intimate their Acceptance of the <hi>Churches Choice;</hi> which they ſucceſſively do, with modeſt Expreſſions of their <hi>Willingneſs</hi> and <hi>Readineſs,</hi> to do the Church all poſſible Service, and their Senſe of their own being <hi>unable</hi> as well as <hi>unworthy</hi> to ſerve the Flock of our Glorious LORD, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting therefore the <hi>Prayers</hi> of all the Faithful for them, that they may faithfully diſcharge eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Truſt that ſhall be repoſed in them.</p>
               <p>So the <hi>Paſtor,</hi> taking the moſt convenient <hi>Place</hi> that he can find in the Aſſembly for it, calls them to him, and laying his <hi>Two Hands</hi> on the <hi>Heads</hi> of the <hi>Two Perſons</hi> (if there be <hi>ſo many,</hi> and when there is but <hi>one Paſio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <q>Whereas You, upon whom theſe Hands are now impoſed, have been choſen to the Office of Deacons in this Church of the Lord, I do now in the Name of that Glorious Lord, and on the behalf of this People, ſolemnly ſet you apart unto the Diſcharge of that Office; And before the Great GOD our SAVIOUR, and before His Elect Angels, I do ſolemnly charge you, to do all the Work of your Office, with all good Integrity: In the Doing whereof, you are to be Grave, not Double-tongue'd, not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to much Wine, not greedy of filthy Lucre: You are to hold the Myſtery of Faith in a Pure Conſcience, and to be blameleſs in well uſing the Office of a Deacon: You are to rule your own Houſes well, and ſo to behave your ſelves that you may have great Boldneſs in the Faith of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; Unto whoſe Grace you are now to be recommended.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Whereupon in another ſhort <hi>Prayer,</hi> with his <hi>Hands</hi> yet impoſed, he recommends them to the <hi>Grace</hi> of GOD, and Petitions, and Pronounces the <hi>Bleſſing</hi> of Heaven upon them.</p>
               <p>Thus it is that the Churches in <hi>New-England</hi> are <hi>Organized.</hi>

               <head>ARTICLE VIII. The DISCIPLINE with which the Churches are kept in their <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Order.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>§. 1. THE Queſtion has been conſidered in the Churches of <hi>New-England, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Paſtor of a Church may not occaſionally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe the Seals of the Covenant in another Church, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Peoples Deſiring of it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it has been very publickly and practical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered, <hi>That they may.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As a <hi>Miniſter</hi> of the Goſpel, or one ſolemnly ſet apart for Evangelical Adminiſtrations, does retain his Character, when preaching in other Congregations, beſides that which is his <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Charge:</hi> The Words of Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> are certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be allowed of;
<q>Altho' we have no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern in the Figment of an <hi>Indelible Character accompanying Sacred Orders,</hi> yet we do not think, that the <hi>Paſtoral Office</hi> is ſuch a Thing as a Man muſt leave behind him every time he goeth from Home: For my own part, if I did not think my ſelf bound to <hi>preach as a Miniſter Authorized</hi> in all Places, and on all Occaſions,
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:002775_0150_0FE6311F5591FCE8"/>when I am called thereunto, I think, I ſhould never Preach any more in this World: —</q> So, 'tis no where ſcrupled, that a Paſtor of a Church, may adminiſter the <hi>Special</hi> and <hi>Sealing</hi> Ordinances, to the Members of another Church, coming to occaſional Communion with him in his own; and if they ſhould <hi>All</hi> of them (even their <hi>whole Church</hi>) ſo com to him, he will not refuſe them. Certainly then, he may as well go to that <hi>other Church,</hi> and adminiſter the Sacred Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances to them in the <hi>Place</hi> where they aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if it be deſired from him: It appears not, why the <hi>Preſence of his own Flock</hi> ſhould be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Legitimate ſuch an Adminiſtration? Why, any more than the <hi>Preſence of the whole Flock</hi> to which any particular Member belongs, to whom he occaſionally adminiſters the <hi>Seals,</hi> when he comes to him in a <hi>Tranſient</hi> Way for it? The <hi>Conſent</hi> and <hi>Requeſt</hi> of the Perſons concerned, <hi>Pro hac Vice,</hi> ſufficiently enables him. The Churches of <hi>New-England</hi> herein differ from the <hi>Rigid Separatiſts,</hi> your <hi>Canne</hi> and Company; and it is expreſly provided in their <hi>Platform,</hi> That <hi>Churches may lend a Miniſter to ſupply the Place of an Abſent or a Sick Miniſter of another Church for a needful Seaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some of the more famous Divines, at the firſt Settlement of theſe Churches, publickly declared, themſelves, for the Affirmative of the Queſtion. And long after them, Dr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> gave it under his Hand, with an, <hi>Ita ſentio, ita ſenſi;</hi>
                  <q>That every true Miniſter, actually ſuch to his own Church, is <hi>Medium Applicabile,</hi> an Inſtrument
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:002775_0151_0FE631234B9EE638"/>that may apply to any Miniſterial Act out of his own Church, in any other Church, if he be there unto called by them.</q> Yea, when <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycarp,</hi> a Scholar of the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> and one Ordained (as <hi>Jerom,</hi> and <hi>Euſebius</hi> and others teſtify) by the Apoſtles themſelves, came from <hi>Smyrna</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> for the Compoſing of ſome Differences, <hi>Anicetus</hi> the Paſtor of the Church there, to expreſs his Love and Honour for him, requeſted him to adminiſter the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> unto the Church, where he now appeared but as a Traveller; and, <hi>he did it.</hi> Now, <hi>Irenaeus</hi> aſſures us, <hi>Polycarp</hi> always taught the Churches to <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve thoſe things which he learned from the Apoſtles themſelves, and nothing elſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Accordingly, In theſe Churches, not only does a <hi>Paſtor</hi> coming occaſionally to an Aſſembly, adminiſter the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of the Lord, unto any <hi>Infant</hi> of the Flock that may be brought for it, if their own Paſtor be out of the Way; But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, upon the <hi>Deſire</hi> of a <hi>Deſtitute Flock</hi> for it, it is allowed that a <hi>Neighbouring Paſtor</hi> may go and adminiſter the <hi>Supper</hi> of the Lord unto them. Only, the Practiſe is the leſs frequent, becauſe the Churches would not encourage a <hi>Deſtitute Flock,</hi> in any thing that may abate their Senſe of the Neceſſity lying upon them, to make as much haſte as they can, out of their <hi>Inorganic,</hi> and <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable,</hi> Circumſtances.</p>
               <p>§. 2. When the <hi>Communicants</hi> in theſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches have Occaſion for to <hi>Travel,</hi> the Paſtors give them LETTERS OF RECOMMENDA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:002775_0152_0FE631234F852500"/>(perhaps not unlike the <hi>Pacific Letters</hi> without which the Primitive Churches would not receive <hi>travelling Strangers,</hi>) Or, Teſtimonials of this Importance? <hi>That — the Bearer hereof having been admitted into the Fellowſhip of the Church</hi> [in the Place mentioned] <hi>and behaved himſelf inoffenſively therein, is upon that Account recommended unto Communion in ſpecial Ordinances, with any Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of our LORD, walking in the Faith and Order of the Goſpel, wherefoever he may have Opportunity in the Travels now before him, to deſire it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed we find, it was a Decree of a <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Council,
<q>That no one ſhould communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in another Church, without a Letter from the Biſhop of his own Church.</q> The Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>New-England</hi> require it not, from ſuch as are otherwiſe known ſufficiently, but where Perſons cannot be well known without it.</p>
               <p>They alſo admit unto <hi>Occaſional Communion,</hi> thoſe who have any <hi>living Teſtimonies</hi> of their having been Communicants in <hi>Scotland,</hi> or <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or any Reforming Churches in <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> or elſewhere, tho' they ſhould happen to be not furniſhed with <hi>written Credentials.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when a Brother in a Church alters and removes his Habitation, and intends an <hi>Abode</hi> with the Church, whereto he would be <hi>Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended;</hi> or, for weighty Reaſons finds it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to conſult his own <hi>Edification,</hi> in changing a <hi>Society;</hi> he applies himſelf unto his own Paſtor for LETTERS OF DISMISSION, or for ſome <hi>Authentic Signification</hi> of the Church, whereto he has hitherto belonged, allowing a <hi>Tranſlation</hi> of
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:002775_0153_0FE631252E9BA400"/>his more <hi>immediate Relation,</hi> unto the Church he would more conſtantly ſit down withal. The <hi>Literae Dimiſſoriae</hi> mentioned by ſome old Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, as peculiar to the <hi>Clergy,</hi> are directed for the <hi>Brethren.</hi> Too many removing without ſome ſuch <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> conſigning the <hi>Church Watch</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Remover, from one Church to another; This <hi>Omiſſion</hi> has been an Occaſion of ſome <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders,</hi> and cauſed ſome Difficulty in the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their <hi>Diſcipline.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And hence it comes to paſs that ſometimes a Perſon does for many Years enjoy a <hi>conſtant Communion</hi> with a Church at the <hi>Table</hi> of the Lord, and yet remains uncapable of <hi>Acting</hi> and <hi>Voting</hi> with the Church as a Member of it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Church Covenant</hi> being but the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> applied unto the ſpecial Purpoſes of a <hi>Church State,</hi> and it being a <hi>Duty</hi> of that <hi>Covenant,</hi> for a Man to join himſelf with ſome <hi>Chriſtian Society,</hi> in obſerving the Laws of our SAVIOUR, where he does in his own <hi>private Judgment of Diſcretion</hi> think that he can beſt purſue and attain the <hi>Ends</hi> of that <hi>Covenant;</hi> a Man joining to any one <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church,</hi> does in effect <hi>confeſs</hi> thus much, with a <hi>Choice</hi> thereupon of that <hi>Chriſtian Society,</hi> whereto he now becomes related, as anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Character.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, when a Perſon judges that he can with more <hi>Edification,</hi> enjoy the Bleſſings of the <hi>New Covenant</hi> in <hi>another Society,</hi> than that with which he has hitherto walked, except the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty have any <hi>juſt Exception</hi> againſt his <hi>Judging</hi> ſo, he does well to ask a <hi>Diſmiſſion,</hi> and they of whom he does ask it, ought then to <hi>give</hi> it. If
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:002775_0154_0FE63125325A2300"/>they <hi>Refuſe</hi> it, a <hi>Council</hi> of Neighbour Churches applied unto, may <hi>order</hi> it.</p>
               <p>But now, the <hi>Paſtor</hi> having firſt asked and gained the Conſent of the <hi>Church</hi> unto it, he writes to the <hi>other Church,</hi> ſomething of this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance;
<q>That [ſuch an One] having for allowable Reaſons requeſted a Diſmiſſion from this Church to that, it is hereby Teſtifyed on on his behalf, that he has been for ſome time, a Communicant with them in all ſpecial Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and by a good Converſation in CHRIST, approved himſelf worthy of it. But now in anſwer to his Juſt Requeſt, they Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs him to the more immediate Fellowſhip of them with whom he is now to Reſide; En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating them to receive him into their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, and extend that Love and Care unto him which is directed in the Rules of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. So with Wiſhes and Prayers for their Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, the Paſtor <hi>Subſcribes,</hi> with the Conſent of the Brethren.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Churches of <hi>New-England,</hi> are encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſuch Uſages, by the Diſcipline of the <hi>French Proteſtants,</hi> whereof it was an Article,
<q>That when any one for his neceſſary Affairs was forced to Travel, Recommendatory Letters to the next Church, were to be Asked and Granted.</q> And the Synod of <hi>Sardis,</hi> A. C. 347. Eſtabliſhed the the Uſe of ſuch <hi>Letters</hi> in the Churches of thoſe Early Days. In the <hi>Primitive Churches</hi> they were called, <hi>Literae Communicatoriae. Tertullian</hi> calls them, <hi>Literas Pacis:</hi> And the <hi>Greek</hi> Churches called them, <hi>Syſtatic Epiſtles.</hi> That fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Dutchman, <hi>Hornbeck,</hi> does commend the
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:002775_0155_0FE6312C3449DD40"/>Churches of <hi>New-England,</hi> for the Uſe of ſuch <hi>Letters.</hi> And unto that Queſtion, <hi>Whether ſuch Letters are not requiſite in the Tranſlation of Members from one Church unto another?</hi> the Incomparable <hi>Voetius</hi> anſwers, <hi>Ita habet ordo Eccleſiaſticus, et lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dabili more obtinet in Eccleſiis Belgicis. Church Order</hi> does require them; and the <hi>Dutch Churches</hi> do obſerve them.</p>
               <p>Inaſmuch as many <hi>Church-Members,</hi> when they have Removed unto other Churches, without a Proſpect of a <hi>Return,</hi> have been too Negligent in ſeeking for an Explicit and Orderly <hi>Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> it is a Practice taken up, That the Churches Deſire and Entruſt their <hi>Paſtors</hi> to ſend unto ſuch Perſons the <hi>Diſmiſſion</hi> which they ſhould have asked for, and oblige them therewith to join themſelves in the moſt regular Manner to the Churches, with which they have now a fixed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode; and let them know, it will be an Offence, if they do, without a very valid Reaſon, delay to do it.</p>
               <p>He that has theſe <hi>Letters of Diſmiſſion,</hi> is yet <hi>Actually a Member</hi> of the Church that gives them, until he be actually joined unto another; capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a <hi>Voting</hi> with it, and liable to the <hi>Cenſures</hi> of it. But being thus furniſhed with <hi>Letters,</hi> like thoſe written of old, on the behalf of <hi>Apollos</hi> to the Diſciples of <hi>Achaia, Exhorting them to receive him;</hi> or like theſe written for <hi>Marcus</hi> to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſians;</hi> or, like thoſe for <hi>Ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="141" facs="unknown:002775_0156_0FE6312C385A0A68"/>the <hi>Letters of Diſmiſſion,</hi> and puts them upon ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying their Willingneſs to receive the Perſon thus <hi>diſmiſſed</hi> unto their Communion, by <hi>lifting up their Hands.</hi> This being done, he repeats unto the Perſon, the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of the <hi>Church-Covenant,</hi> and upon his Conſent thereunto, he declares the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> of the Church to acknowledge him with all Chriſtian Regards in their <hi>Sacred Fellowſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They that have gone yet no further than the <hi>Covenant of Baptiſm,</hi> for themſelves and theirs, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Removal are to carry ſome <hi>Certificate</hi> from their <hi>Paſtor</hi> unto him under whoſe Miniſtry they are now to reſide; which qualifies them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <hi>Baptiſm</hi> for their Children, which may be there born unto them: and alſo entitles the Church there, to proceed with <hi>Rebukes</hi> upon them in Caſe of their falling into any <hi>Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Offences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 3. <hi>In the Primitive Church there was a Godly Diſcipline, that ſuch Perſons as were notorious Sinners, were put to open Penance in this World, that their Souls may be ſaved in the Day of the Lord, and that others admoniſhed by their Exemple, might be more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to offend.</hi> Now as the Churches of <hi>New-England,</hi> were at firſt planted, partly on the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Obtaining and Maintaining the Exerciſe of ſuch a <hi>Diſcipline;</hi> A Deſign for which they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, they had a ſufficient <hi>Warrant</hi> of our SAVIOUR; So this <hi>Diſcipline</hi> has been hitherto more or leſs exerciſed.</p>
               <p>If one under the <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of the Church, fall into a <hi>Scandalous Tranſgreſſun</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:002775_0157_0FE6312E284236A0"/>the Laws of our Holy Redeemer, and the Tranſgreſſion be <hi>at once,</hi> and <hi>at firſt</hi> a Matter of <hi>publick Fame,</hi> the <hi>Paſtor</hi> upon the <hi>Cry,</hi> reckons it his Duty to <hi>Enquire</hi> into it, and bring it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately under an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Cognizance.</hi>

               <p>In the <hi>Primitive Churches,</hi> we find not only <hi>Schiſm, Idolatry, Hereſy, Covetouſneſs, Gluttony, Drunkenneſs, Fornication,</hi> and <hi>Adultery,</hi> expreſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>Cenſurable Evils,</hi> [Quaere, How did they convict any Man of <hi>Covetouſneſs;</hi> a Fault which ordinarily no Man ever thinks himſelf guilty of!] but alſo as <hi>Origen</hi> writes, <hi>All other Sins whatſoever. Cyprian</hi> therefore tells us, That not only, <hi>Graviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſima et extrema Delicta,</hi> Groſſer Offences, but alſo, <hi>Minora Delicta,</hi> leſſer ones, were <hi>Cenſured</hi> among them. The Churches of <hi>New-England</hi> have no expreſs and agreed <hi>Catalogue</hi> of the <hi>Crimes,</hi> that ſhall expoſe to <hi>Cenſures,</hi> except what is in the <hi>Bible</hi> it ſelf: But the Rule which they profeſs, is, That an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Animadverſion</hi> belongs to ſuch <hi>plain Treſpaſſes</hi> againſt the Rules of a <hi>Godly,</hi> and a <hi>Sober,</hi> and a <hi>Righteous</hi> Life, as we may <hi>juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Judge,</hi> that a Perſon under our Meaſures of <hi>Illumination</hi> cannot <hi>obſtinately perſiſt in,</hi> without forfeiting an Intereſt in the <hi>Kingdom of GOD.</hi> Such <hi>Opinions,</hi> and ſuch <hi>Practices,</hi> as it may be our Duty to believe Conſiſtent with true PIETY, the <hi>Cenſures</hi> of the Churches do not animadvert upon. The Evangelical <hi>Church State,</hi> being in ſome ſort the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> the Churches of <hi>New-England</hi> endeavour to make theirs a <hi>Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sermon</hi> to the World, upon the Requiſites of Mens being received into <hi>Heaven</hi> at the laſt. As in their <hi>Admiſſions</hi> they ſtudy Practically to

               </p>
               <p>Indeed, while no body queſtions, Whether pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane <hi>Swearing</hi> and <hi>Curſing,</hi> evident <hi>Sabbath-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Drunkenneſs, Fighting, Fornication</hi> and all Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous <hi>Unchaſtities, Cheating, Stealing,</hi> an Aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donment unto <hi>Idleneſs, Lying,</hi> unrighteous <hi>Defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,</hi> and ſuch <hi>Hereſies</hi> as manifeſtly overturn the Foundations of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> and of all PIETY, are <hi>Cenſurable Evils;</hi> the Churches have ſometimes had ſome Difficulties, about <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocious Nativites.</hi> But if a Child evidently come to the <hi>Growth</hi> which <hi>Nine Months,</hi> are ordinarily al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for, be born within about <hi>Seven Months</hi> after Marriage, it is ordinarily expected, that the Fault of an <hi>Unlawful Congreſs</hi> be publickly and penitently acknowledged; except the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Perſons offer a Purgation by an <hi>Oath,</hi> or a Declaration that ſhall be equivalent, for their Innocency. But the <hi>Birth</hi> may be ſo Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature, that no ſuch <hi>Purgation</hi> may be admitted of.</p>
               <p>But a <hi>ſcandalous Offence</hi> againſt <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> ariſing, 'tis thus proceeded with.</p>

                  <pb n="144" facs="unknown:002775_0159_0FE6313354DE77E0"/>
The <hi>Paſtor</hi> ſends for the <hi>Delinquent,</hi> and uſually he deſires a few of the <hi>chief Brethren</hi> to be with him in the Action; and enquiring into the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Cauſe,</hi> he finds one of theſe to be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. Either the <hi>Delinquent</hi> manifeſteth himſelf ſo ſenſible of his <hi>Miſcarriage,</hi> that only a <hi>Publick Acknowledgement</hi> before the whole Church is to be expected from him; or elſe there is yet manifeſt that <hi>hardneſs of Heart,</hi> that beſpeaks for him a <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Admonition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When 'tis judged that a public ACKNOW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEDGEMENT, may make the <hi>Plaiſter</hi> for the <hi>Wounds</hi> which the Tranſgreſſor has given to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion as <hi>broad as the Sore,</hi> he is put either upon <hi>Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of his <hi>Acknowledgement,</hi> (which is moſt uſual) or upon <hi>ſpeaking</hi> of it, as 'tis foreſeen will be moſt for Edification. And then in ſome Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Faithful, either the <hi>Church alone</hi> (which is thought moſt Adviſeable where the Neighbourhood is very Populous, and full of Strangers) or the <hi>Reſt</hi> of the Neighbourhood ſtaying with the <hi>Church</hi> (which is the Cuſtom in moſt Places;) the <hi>Paſtor</hi> gives the <hi>Church</hi> a true Report of the <hi>Scandal,</hi> and adds his Hope of the Man's having Repenced of it; who now appears before them, to teſtify it with a <hi>Confeſſion</hi> proper to the Occaſion, which is then exhibited. Thus, there was an <hi>Exomologeſis</hi> enjoined on the <hi>Penitents</hi> in the Primitive Churches; and there was that whereof <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſo expreſſes himſelf, <hi>Satisfactio Confeſſione diſponitur, Confeſſione Poenitentia naſcitur.</hi> This being done, the <hi>Paſtor</hi> puts it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Vote of their upliſted Hands, <hi>Whether they
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:002775_0160_0FE6313358C8C1D0"/>accept the Satisfaction which has been thus offered by the Repenting Brother before them, and are willing to reſtore him to their Favour and Fellowſhip?</hi> Which being ſignified, the <hi>Paſter</hi> then makes a loving and faithful Speech unto the <hi>Reſtored Perſon;</hi> mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying the Mercy of GOD unto the <hi>Penitent,</hi> and therewith directing and exciting of him to improve what has now occurred, for his more <hi>circumſpect Walk</hi> all the Remainder of his <hi>Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage;</hi> And then unto <hi>the reſt</hi> of the Aſſembly, to take notice what thoſe Evils are which they now ſee muſt be <hi>repented</hi> of, and <hi>Watch</hi> and <hi>Pray</hi> that they may not fall into them.</p>
               <p>Where 'tis judged that a publick ADMONI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION is needful, the <hi>Paſtor</hi> warns the <hi>Offender</hi> to give his Attendance upon the Church at the Time that he prefixes unto him; and in ſome <hi>Congregation</hi> of the Faithful, as before, he lays be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Church,</hi> a ſhort, plain, full Narrative of the <hi>Offence,</hi> which the Brother now before him has fallen into; with the <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> of <hi>it,</hi> and of the <hi>Unſucceſsfulneſs</hi> which hath hitherto been up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Means to bring him unto a due Remorſe for it; Wherefore he alſo now calls upon the Perſon, to offer any further <hi>Tokens</hi> of <hi>Repentance,</hi> if there be with him any to be offered.</p>
               <p>Thus, among theſe Churches, as well as among the Churches in <hi>Origen</hi>'s Time, the Delinquent muſt appear, <hi>Before the whole Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Perſon do out of <hi>Contempt</hi> refuſe to make his <hi>Appearance,</hi> the Paſtor moves the Church to concur (after ſome further Exerciſe of <hi>Patience,</hi>
                  <pb n="146" facs="unknown:002775_0161_0FE6313526ED2238"/>if in their Lenity they think it neceſſary) unto his <hi>Excommunication.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If he do now appear, and give ſuch Expreſſions of <hi>Repentance,</hi> that the <hi>Paſtor</hi> with the <hi>Brethren</hi> conclude his Heart come to the Frame it ſhould be in, and the Honour of the Goſpel ſufficiently vindicated, they do then by a <hi>Vote</hi> ſignify their Acceptance of him; Whereupon the <hi>Paſtor</hi> makes a <hi>Speech</hi> unto him, and unto the reſt of the Aſſembly, proper for the Occaſion.</p>
               <p>But if his <hi>Repentance,</hi> upon its being weighed in the Ballance, <hi>be found Wanting,</hi> the <hi>Paſtor</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds it unto the <hi>Brethren,</hi> that they may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed unto a more ſolemn <hi>Admonition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſad Caſes of <hi>Cenſures,</hi> it has been tho't an <hi>Indecency,</hi> to ask for the Vote of <hi>Uplifted Hands:</hi> But the <hi>Paſtor</hi> chuſes to tell the <hi>Brethren,</hi> that if no Objection be made againſt the <hi>Proceeding,</hi> he ſhall <hi>take their Silence for a loud Expreſſion of their Concurrence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereupon, either at this Time or at ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appointed by the <hi>Paſtor,</hi> the Offender ſtands forth in the <hi>Chriſtian Aſſembly;</hi> and the <hi>Paſtor</hi> diſtinctly ſets before him his <hi>Faults,</hi> with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Rules</hi> in the Goſpel, which have in his <hi>Faults</hi> been violated, concluding with Terms of this Importance.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Wherefore in the Name of the moſt Glorious GOD our SAVIOUR, (which Name you have Diſhonoured by Sinning againſt him;) and with the Concurrence of this His People (a People that long to ſee you recovered out of the Sinful Diſtemper now upon you;) I AD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MONISH you, to Repent of the Scandals
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:002775_0162_0FE631352C8114E8"/>which we have ſeen proved againſt you, as well as of the more ſecret Faults, by which you may have provoked the Holy One to leave you to what is more openly Scandalous. I ADMO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NISH you, to repair unto the Blood of the Redeemer, that you may be cleanſed from all your Sins, in that Fountain ſet open for Sin and for Uncleanneſs. I ADMONISH you, to cry mightily unto the Spirit of the Lord, for that new and ſoft Heart, that ſhall incline you, not only to confeſs your Sin with unfeigned Sorrow, but alſo to forſake it with Eternal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation. I ſignify unto you, that as there is Grace enough in our Great SAVIOUR for you, if you return to him, ſo upon ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, this Flock of his will make you ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of His Grace, by renewing the Marks of their Favour to you. But I ſignify unto you, that until we ſee good Symptoms of a Penitent Heart upon you, We SUSPEND you from the Priviledges of our Sacred Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and if you continue Impenitent, we muſt proceed unto a further Declaration of that Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which will be a Terrible Repreſentation of your Baniſhment from the Kingdom of GOD. GOD forbid that it ſhould come to this! That it may not come to this, we will now pour out our moſt affectionate Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for you.</q>
               </p>
               <p>So the Paſtor makes a pathetical <hi>Prayer</hi> for the recovering of the fallen Sinner, and a <hi>Bleſſing</hi> upon the <hi>Cenſure</hi> now applied unto him, and upon the <hi>Warning</hi> which the whole Aſſembly has therein Received.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="unknown:002775_0163_0FE6313C747C62D8"/>
Perhaps he thinks it alſo proper to make a ſhort Speech unto the Aſſembly, directing a <hi>Right Improvement</hi> of the whole Tranſaction.</p>
               <p>If the Perſon by ſome late <hi>Removal</hi> reſide at ſo conſiderable a Diſtance from the Church, that he cannot well attend, then, upon a full Proof of the <hi>Scandal</hi> againſt him, the Church agrees to ſend unto him an <hi>Admonition</hi> in a <hi>Letter,</hi> which the <hi>Paſtor</hi> forms and ſigns accordingly.</p>
               <p>When a Perſon has thus received an <hi>Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> for a <hi>Scandal,</hi> the <hi>Private Chriſtians</hi> who dwell near him, reckon it their Duty, by <hi>Viſiting</hi> of him, and by <hi>Diſcourſing</hi> with him, to proſecute the <hi>good Effects</hi> thereof upon him.</p>
               <p>Where a <hi>Scandalous Tranſgreſſion</hi> is known only to <hi>One</hi> or <hi>Two,</hi> the Proceedings of the Perſons that know it, are the ſame, that they are in the Caſe of a <hi>Perſonal Injury:</hi> The Steps directed in the XVIII. Ch. of <hi>Mathew.</hi> He that knows the Offence, firſt of all <hi>himſelf</hi> goes to the Offender, and ſeriouſly endeavours to bring him to <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> If the Offender be <hi>Obſtinate,</hi> he then (hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Proof</hi> to convict him) takes one or two <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> with him, and renews his Endeavours that the Man may come to Repentance. If this be ineffectual, <hi>They</hi> carry the Complaint unto the <hi>Paſtor,</hi> who purſues the Deſigns of <hi>Humiliation</hi> on the Soul of the Offender. If the Man does now <hi>Relent,</hi> and the Offence be ſtill in a ſure Way to be <hi>kept private,</hi> the Satisfaction thus <hi>privately given,</hi> is taken up withal. But if either the Man continue <hi>Impenitent,</hi> or the Matter have ſo taken Air, as to be a Matter of <hi>common Fame,</hi> and the
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:002775_0164_0FE6313C78284050"/>
                  <hi>Talk of the People,</hi> then it falls into the Courſe, that ſuch a Matter is to be treated withal.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Repentance</hi> of a Perſon duely <hi>admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed</hi> has been a competent Meaſure of Time waited for, and no <hi>Fruits of Repentance</hi> are found upon him, the Church paſſes on to that HIGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>EST CENSURE, which is by <hi>Dionyſius</hi> of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi> called, <hi>A Driving away from the Church;</hi> By <hi>Tertullian, An Abjection and a Depulſion from the Church;</hi> By <hi>Cyprian, A Separation from the Church, and an Ejection out of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, in ſome <hi>Atrocious Crimes,</hi> wherein the moſt <hi>ſevere Teſtimonies</hi> againſt the things, whereof the Holy Son of GOD has declared, <hi>I hate them,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear neceſſary to reſcue the Church from <hi>His Wrath,</hi> and from an <hi>evil Report</hi> in the World, and to break the <hi>Heart of Stone</hi> in the Criminal, the Churches do ſometimes proceed, <hi>ipſo Facto,</hi> to an <hi>Excommunication.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in theſe Churches, the Difference between the <hi>Leſſer Excommunication</hi> and the <hi>Greater Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,</hi> has appeared ſo very little, that the <hi>Suſpenſion</hi> laid upon an Offender, at his <hi>Admonition</hi> is often ſtopped at, without going any further. The Order, <hi>Put away the wicked Perſon,</hi> is therein complied withal.</p>
               <p>But there are <hi>Degrees of Solemnity</hi> in <hi>putting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> ſuch an one; and the Sentence called, <hi>An EXCOMMUNICATION,</hi> is to be more formally pronounced upon the juſt Occaſions.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Paſtor</hi> never proceeds unto it, without the Concurrence of the <hi>Brethren;</hi> And we know that in <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Age, the Offenders pleaded their Cauſe, <hi>Apud univerſam Plebem;</hi> and an <hi>Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication</hi>
                  <pb n="150" facs="unknown:002775_0165_0FE6313D82BA0F20"/>was ordered, <hi>Secundum Plebis divina Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In parallelling this Way of <hi>New-England,</hi> we will for Brevity, only take Advantage of a Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from an Eminent <hi>Scotch Presbyterian,</hi> even the Pious and the Learned <hi>Rutherford,</hi> whoſe Words are theſe.
<q>Grave <hi>Beza, Calvin, Bucer, Bullinger, Melancthon, Bucan, Paraeus, Rivetus, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brandus, Junius, Trelcatius;</hi> The Fathers, <hi>Cyprian, Jerom, Auguſtin, Nazianzen, Chryſoſtom, Ambroſe, Theodoret, Theophylact,</hi> require all things to be done <hi>Conſentiente Plebe,</hi> with the <hi>Peoples Conſent.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Paſtor</hi> ordering the Offender to attend at the <hi>Time appointed,</hi> he then gives him an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to expreſs his <hi>Repentance:</hi> Which if the <hi>Paſtor</hi> perceives not now done unto Satisfaction, he does with a proper Zeal propoſe unto the <hi>Brethren,</hi> Whether any one of them can <hi>Object</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their proceeding unto the <hi>Cenſure</hi> of an <hi>Excommunication</hi> upon the <hi>Incorrigible Offender;</hi> — But if they Concur thereunto, he ſhall take their <hi>Silence</hi> for a full Intimation of their <hi>Conſent</hi> unto ſo ſad an Action. Hereupon the <hi>Paſtor</hi> (either now goes on unto the Action, or) ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies unto the <hi>Offender,</hi> that he muſt on ſuch a Day give his Attendence, and hear then what the <hi>Church</hi> has to ſay unto him. If he refuſe to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend on the Day ſpecified, the <hi>Cenſure</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced upon him, for his adding of ſuch a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacy</hi> unto his former <hi>Iniquity.</hi> But if he do at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, the Paſtor having recited a <hi>ſummary Account</hi> of the Caſe, in the hearing of the Congregation, once more gives the Offender a Liberty to ſpeak
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:002775_0166_0FE6313D87A11C18"/>what he can, for the Prevention of that <hi>Sentence,</hi> which is elſe waiting for him. If what he ſays be not a ſufficient <hi>Arreſt</hi> of the <hi>Judgment,</hi> then, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> elegantly deſcribes this awful Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Judicatur magno cum pondere, ut apud certos de Dei Conſpectu, ſummumque futuri Judicii Praejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um eſt.</hi> The <hi>Paſtor</hi> once again, takes the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the <hi>Brethren,</hi> as he did before; and then proceeds with all poſſible Seriouſneſs, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, Majeſty, Compaſſion, and Solemnity, unto the <hi>Cenſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>Primitive Times,</hi> we find that he who paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the <hi>formal Sentence</hi> on the Criminal, firſt begun with <hi>Exhortations;</hi> that is to ſay, He <hi>exhorted</hi> the Faithful with all Diligent Fear and Care, to avoid the Sins which had brought the Offender before them, into ſuch a deplorable Condition. Then followed ſharp <hi>Reprehenſions</hi> to the <hi>Offender</hi> himſelf, rebuking him for his foul Enormities; as being provoking to GOD, provoking to good Men, and pernicious to his own Soul; And in the cloſe of all, the <hi>Divine Cenſure</hi> was pronounced. Much <hi>ſuch</hi> is the Method of <hi>Excommunication</hi> in the Churches of <hi>New-England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Churches formerly, There was little ſcruple made, of uſing in <hi>Excommunications,</hi> the Form of, <hi>Delivering up the Offender to Satan, for the Deſtruction of the Fleſh, that the Spirit may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Day of the Lord Jeſus:</hi> By which they meant, That the Offender, now being declared and cenſured, as one viſibly belonging to the <hi>Kingdom of Satan,</hi> 'twas hoped ſuch a Conviction of his miſerable State would hence ariſe unto his
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:002775_0167_0FE63142C1E1C7F0"/>Mind, That his <hi>Corruption</hi> would be thereby mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifyed, and <hi>Salvation</hi> furthered.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Paſtors</hi> in ſome of the Churches, have now eſpouſed another Notion of the <hi>Traditio Satanae</hi> mentioned by the Apoſtle to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aus,</hi> as being a <hi>Prerogative Apoſtolical</hi> and <hi>Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary.</hi> The Sovereign GOD ſometimes gave to His <hi>Prophets</hi> the Power of inflicting <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> or <hi>Diſtreſſes,</hi> on the Bodies of ungodly Men, and of pronouncing upon them thoſe <hi>Bodily Miſchiefs,</hi> whereof he has made <hi>Satan</hi> or the <hi>Angel of Death,</hi> to be the Executioner; Of ſuch a Power, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elijah</hi> in the <hi>Old</hi> Teſtament, and <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> in the <hi>New,</hi> have given us Tremendous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. And this Power may ſeem to have been that <hi>Virga Apoſtolica</hi> whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 Cor. IV. 21. <hi>Shall I come unto you with a Rod?</hi> On which the Author of the Ancient Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary falſely aſcribed unto <hi>Jerom</hi> has this true Gloſs, <hi>Quali Virga? Quali</hi> Petrus <hi>venit ad</hi> Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam <hi>et</hi> Sapphiram, <hi>et</hi> Paulus <hi>ad</hi> Magum; ſuch a <hi>Rod</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> uſed on <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> and ſuch as <hi>Paul</hi> uſed on <hi>Elymas</hi> the Sorcerer. And what <hi>Paul</hi> did on <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and <hi>Philetus</hi> may be a further Inſtance of it. When the Apoſtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed <hi>the Deſtruction of the Fleſh,</hi> unto the Offender whom he <hi>delivered unto Satan,</hi> the Oppoſition of <hi>the Spirit</hi> in the next Clauſe makes it evident that <hi>the Body</hi> is intended; He decreed then, that the <hi>Body</hi> of Offender ſhould be left unto <hi>Satanical</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions and Afflictions, by the Terrors where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of his poor <hi>Soul</hi> might be awakened unto a <hi>Saving Repentance. Chryſoſtom</hi> accordingly, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <hi>Greek,</hi> expounds the
ΟΛΕΘΡΟΝ ΣΑΡΚΟΣ as

I declare you to belong viſibly to the ſinful and woful Kingdom of Satan, the Ruler of the Darkneſs of this World.

After this <hi>Depoſition,</hi> the two Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops claimed the Exerciſe of their Authority; But the People denied it unto them: And when the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>Africa</hi> hereupon A. C. 258. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened in a <hi>Synod,</hi> whereof <hi>Cyprian</hi> was the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident,
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:002775_0178_0FE631571FB6BA88"/>the Action of the Churches was approved and commended, and this <hi>Doctrine</hi> aſſerted, That they had not acted irregularly ſince <hi>the People had the chief Power of chuſing worthy Biſhops, and of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing thoſe that are Unworthy.</hi>

               <p>If the Reader will go ſomewhat higher into <hi>Antiquity,</hi> he may from the <hi>Archives</hi> thereof take down that famous <hi>Epiſtle</hi> of <hi>Clemens Romanus</hi> to the <hi>Brethren</hi> of the Church in <hi>Corinth,</hi> which in <hi>Euſebius</hi> is deſervedly called, ΜΕΓΑΛΗ ΚΑΙ ΘΑΥΜΑ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ΣΙΑ, and, ΙΚΑΝΩΤΑΤΗ ΓΡΑΦΗ, A <hi>great,</hi> a <hi>wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> a <hi>powerful</hi> Writing, and one which, he ſays, was <hi>publickly read in ſome of the Churches:</hi> And which <hi>Irenaeus</hi> alſo moſt juſtly calls, <hi>Potentiſſimas Literas.</hi> In all <hi>Antiquity,</hi> after the Writings of their <hi>Apoſtles</hi> (which indeed make an Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Mention of this our <hi>Clemens,</hi> Phil. IV. 3.) there is not ſo exact a Repreſentation of the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> obſerved in the <hi>firſt Chriſtian Churches,</hi> as there is in this <hi>Epiſtle.</hi> Now this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> being written to the <hi>Brethren</hi> of the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> from that at <hi>Rome,</hi> on the Occaſion of a <hi>Sinful Exceſs</hi> which they had committed in the <hi>Depoſition of their Elders,</hi> there is not one Word ſaid, as if the <hi>Brethren had aſſumed a Liberty</hi> to themſelves, which they had no claim unto; but they are ſeverely reproved, becauſe they had <hi>Abuſed</hi> their <hi>Liberty,</hi> in hearkening unto the Suggeſtions of Two or Three <hi>diſcontented Perſons,</hi> againſt <hi>Elders</hi> who had <hi>preſided Laudably</hi> among them, and who had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deſerved thus to be dealt withal.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding this, the Churches of <hi>New-England</hi> conſider, that as their <hi>Paſtors</hi> are not <hi>Ordained</hi> without a <hi>Council,</hi> ſo neither are they
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:002775_0179_0FE6315BFB76AFD0"/>without a <hi>Council</hi> to be <hi>depoſed.</hi> Nor do they think, that <hi>ordinarily</hi> a <hi>Church-Meeting</hi> may be regularly held, without the Conſent of their <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</hi> They are not altogether ignorant, that in the <hi>Primitive Times,</hi> where Churches were <hi>aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,</hi> and their Circumſtances would allow of it, they did not by <hi>themſelves alone,</hi> exert thoſe <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> which in Caſes of <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> they might aſſert as belonging to them. The Churches to prevent the Miſchiefs of <hi>Giddineſs</hi> and <hi>Faction,</hi> and render all their <hi>Actions unqueſtionable,</hi> would have their Complaints againſt <hi>Scandalous Paſtors</hi> heard by a <hi>Synod,</hi> without the Concurrence whereof ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſuch Paſtors come not under a <hi>Depoſition.</hi> Thus we find <hi>Paulus Samoſatenus,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> was depoſed by a <hi>Synod,</hi> held in that Place. And we find <hi>Privatus</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Lambeſe,</hi> was <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naginta Epiſcoporum Sententia condemnatus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore when a <hi>Paſtor</hi> has fallen into <hi>Scandal,</hi> the Brethren that are acquainted with it, proceed, as they would with another <hi>Brother</hi> in ſuch Caſes; only with ſuch <hi>ſpecial Terms</hi> of <hi>Reſpect</hi> (and Repetition of <hi>Addreſs</hi>) as the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>Father</hi> may call for.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Scandal</hi> be gone ſo far that a <hi>publick Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi> is become neceſſary, the <hi>Diſſatisfied Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> apply themſelves to him, and requeſt him to appoint a <hi>Church-Meeting,</hi> for the hearing and the healing of the Matter.</p>
               <p>If <hi>he</hi> comply, and have his Heart at the <hi>Church-Meeting,</hi> touched with a due Remorſe; he offers them his <hi>Acknowledgement;</hi> which if they judge it neceſſary, they demand that he <hi>Repeat</hi> it, yet more public<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>But if he be ſo <hi>ſelf-willed,</hi> that he will not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a <hi>Church-Meeting,</hi> the <hi>Diſſatisfied Brethren,</hi> do ſet apart ſome time together to call upon the Glorious GOD for His Direction and Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the <hi>Grievous Caſe</hi> now come upon them, and privately adviſe with ſome of the <hi>Paſtors</hi> in the Neighbourhood; Whereupon they write Letters unto ſome of the Neighbouring Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, wherein they ſignify, that ſome unhappy <hi>Offences</hi> have ariſen among them, for the manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and compoſing whereof, the help of a <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> appears to be neceſſary; for which Cauſe they humbly pray, that the Churches would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their Love and Care for them and ſend their <hi>Paſtors</hi> and other <hi>Delegates</hi> (at the <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Place</hi> intimated) effectually to adviſe them what may be their Duty on ſo ſad an Occaſion.</p>
               <p>Or, if at the <hi>Church-Meeting,</hi> he and they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not agree; nay, tho' he ſhould hook in the <hi>Major part</hi> unto a <hi>Palliation</hi> of the Matters, and there be no more than two or Three that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſtill aggrieved; the <hi>Diſſatisfied Brethren</hi> make a Tender to join with him in calling of a <hi>Council:</hi> which if he refuſe, then theſe do it without him: Only they ſtill give Notice unto <hi>him</hi> (and his <hi>Party</hi> if he have any,) what they do.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Council</hi> arrives, they firſt more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately form themſelves into <hi>Order,</hi> by chuſing a <hi>Moderator,</hi> and ſpeaking with all Perſons concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo far as they count it needful, by way of <hi>Preparation</hi> for their Buſineſs. Then they paſs
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:002775_0181_0FE6315E8DDDF510"/>to the <hi>Meeting-Houſe;</hi> where being firſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently <hi>ſeated,</hi> all Perſons that will may ſee and hear all that is done.

               <p>The <hi>Council</hi> then <hi>retire</hi> to their more private Conſultation; where they draw up their <hi>final Judgment;</hi> Returning anon to the <hi>publick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,</hi> for the Publication of it.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Offendor</hi> do now come unto them with ſufficient Expreſſions of <hi>Repentance,</hi> they direct a Satisfactory <hi>Repetition</hi> thereof <hi>Now</hi> in the public Aſſembly, (and if need be, on ſome following <hi>Lord's Day</hi> alſo;) and they adviſe the <hi>Diſſatisfied Brethren</hi> to reſtore their juſt Regards unto him.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Offendor</hi> be <hi>obſtinate,</hi> they then <hi>ſharply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke</hi> him; and in a <hi>Written Inſtrument,</hi> ſigned by the <hi>Moderator,</hi> and <hi>all the Council,</hi> (or by him, <hi>In the Name of the Council</hi> —) they pronounce him <hi>Unworthy of the Sacred Miniſtry,</hi> and adviſe the Church (after due Waiting) to <hi>ſupply</hi> his Place with a more worthy Perſon; and alſo to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed unto an <hi>Excommunication,</hi> if he continue in his Impenitency.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Council</hi> returning to the public Aſſembly, there, after ſeaſonable Speeches made by the <hi>Moderator,</hi> (and others of the <hi>Council,</hi> if they pleaſe) the <hi>Reſult</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> is read, and then delivered unto one of the <hi>Brethren,</hi> at whoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation they are here together.

               <p>If aſter all, the Church muſt come unto that Extremity of an <hi>Excommunication</hi> upon this <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendor,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>On the Mention of this, it may be added, That <hi>Churches</hi> remaining Vacant after the Death of their <hi>Paſtors,</hi> upon <hi>Difficulties</hi> and <hi>Emergencies</hi> ariſing among themſelves, and Affairs which need a greater Wiſdom than their own to manage them, they apply themſelves unto ſome <hi>conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Miniſter</hi> in their Vicinity: Entreating him to afford his <hi>Preſence</hi> at their <hi>Church-Meeting,</hi> and manage their <hi>Votes,</hi> and regulate all their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</p>
               <p>§. 3. The <hi>Tranſlation</hi> of a PASTOR, is a Thing more ſeldom Occurring, and more hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Obtained, in the Churches of <hi>New-England,</hi> than in many other of the <hi>Reformed Churches.</hi> The <hi>Relation</hi> between a <hi>Paſtor,</hi> and his <hi>People,</hi> is what the Chriſtians throughout the Country, appear generally to think not very eaſy to be diſſolved; and the <hi>Removal of a Miniſter</hi> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed here, with more Difficulty than it is in many other Places. More than Once or Twice there have been publiſhed ſome <hi>Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,</hi> which expreſs the General Apprehenſion in the Churches upon the Matter, to this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
<q>A <hi>Paſtor</hi> ſettled in the Service of a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is to be ſo ſenſible of his <hi>Deſignation</hi> by the SPIRIT and Providence of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, for that <hi>Service,</hi> and of the <hi>Account</hi> that he muſt give unto GOD, about his Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in it, that his <hi>Removal</hi> muſt not be raſhly
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:002775_0183_0FE63165EE8CC750"/>attempted, but with much Conſideration, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation, Supplication, and ſincere Deſire to follow the Conduct of Heaven in it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>And,</hi> That the <hi>Will</hi> of our LORD about the <hi>Removal</hi> of any <hi>Paſtor</hi> from his <hi>People</hi> may be underſtood, it is requiſite, that the Miniſter do not entirely <hi>Aſſume to himſelf</hi> the Judgment of his own Call to Remove; but a great Regard muſt be had unto the Direction of the Churches in the Neighbourhood. <hi>And;</hi> If much of <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,</hi> will certainly enſue upon the <hi>Removal</hi> of a a <hi>Paſtor</hi> from his <hi>People, That</hi> ſhould weigh down againſt many Circumſtances that would rather invite it.</q> Upon ſuch Views, it has been judg'd requiſite; <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the <hi>Reaſons</hi> of the Removal be laid before <hi>Authentic Judges,</hi> and by theſe be pronounced ſuch, that the <hi>Removal</hi> thereupon may be juſtly and wiſely proceeded in. And, Where it can be obtained, a <hi>Council</hi> of Churches ought therefore to be convened; As there was for the <hi>Ordaining.</hi> And, <hi>Then;</hi> That the <hi>Reaſons</hi> be found ſuch as are conſiſtent with the <hi>Solemn Vow,</hi> which the Perſon who takes the Charge of a Church, makes unto our Glorious LORD, for the faithful Diſcharge of his Miniſtry; and the <hi>Labour,</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> of one ſenſible that his Works are known unto the Lord; and the ſervent <hi>Love</hi> that ſuch an one ſhould bear to his <hi>Flock; hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in his Heart for to Live and to Die with them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes, but <hi>Rarely,</hi> a <hi>Paſtor</hi> and a <hi>People</hi> have with <hi>Mutual Agreement</hi> more <hi>privately</hi> parted with one another; — and <hi>no further Words have been made about it!</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="169" facs="unknown:002775_0184_0FE63165F2328278"/>
               <p>It is very Edifying to ſee, That whereas many <hi>Congregations</hi> in the World, would count it A <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance</hi> (And, <hi>It would be ſo!</hi>) to have their <hi>Miniſters</hi> taken from them, the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of this Country <hi>have been,</hi> and <hi>ſtill are,</hi> generally ſo Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed and Beloved by their People, that if there were any Motion towards the Calling one of them away, there would be a grievous Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among the People upon it; — even as if <hi>Robbers of Churches</hi> were aſſaulting them.</p>
               <p>Indeed, if there be but <hi>One Paſtor</hi> in a Church, be <hi>He</hi> never ſo <hi>Great,</hi> and <hi>It</hi> never ſo <hi>Small,</hi> no Body durſt ſcarce whiſper a Word of his <hi>Remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val</hi> to another, tho' it might carry with it never ſuch an <hi>Enlargement</hi> of his Opportunities to be Serviceable. And ſome have thought the <hi>public Benefit,</hi> and <hi>common Intereſt</hi> of the Churches in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral has not been ſo well conſulted in this <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Confinement</hi> of Grown and Bright Abilities.</p>
               <p>When a Church has been enriched with <hi>Two</hi> Worthy <hi>Paſtors,</hi> another Church that has been <hi>as a City ſet upon an Hill,</hi> and a Seat of great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, has applied unto them, to obtain one of their <hi>Paſtors</hi> from them.

               <p>When the Government of the <hi>Colleges</hi> hath been Vacant, <hi>Paſtors</hi> of <hi>Churches</hi> have been choſen to it.

<pb n="171" facs="unknown:002775_0186_0FE5F4B027BCA350"/>Prevention of ſuch Things has been this; That the <hi>Councils</hi> having exhibited their <hi>Deciſions,</hi> do not preſently <hi>Diſſolve,</hi> but <hi>Adjourn</hi> themſelves for ſome Time [certain or uncertain] to ſee, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their <hi>Advice</hi> be attended or no. The <hi>New Engliſh Councils</hi> have been generally ſo regularly compoſed, and in ſo good a Temper, that there has been in them very little Occaſion for the old Complaint, <hi>Omne Concilium parit Bellum;</hi> or for ſuch a Story as that of <hi>Curcellaeus, Experientiam docere nullas unquam Controverſias de Religione inter Chriſtiancs exortas, Auctoritate Synodali foeliciter ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatas fuiſſe.</hi>

               <p>Nevertheleſs, it is <hi>Believed,</hi> and ſometimes has been <hi>practiſed,</hi> That when any one <hi>Particular Church,</hi> commits a <hi>notorious Error</hi> in its Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the <hi>Churches</hi> in the Neighbourhood, upon the <hi>Noiſe</hi> and <hi>Proof</hi> of it may write <hi>Letters of Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> unto the <hi>Erring Church;</hi> not unlike thoſe of old written from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> unto the Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And tho' it has never yet been among the <hi>Practiſes,</hi> yet it is one of the <hi>Principles</hi> in theſe Churches, That the <hi>Neighbouring Churches,</hi> upon the Motion of their <hi>Paſtors,</hi> may without any Call from the <hi>Church,</hi> (or from any in the <hi>Church</hi>) where <hi>groſs Miſchiefs</hi> do notoriouſly happen, upon the juſtly believed Report of thoſe Miſchiefs, meet in a <hi>Council</hi> to take a Courſe about them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>That</hi> theſe <hi>Aſſociated Paſtors</hi> be together ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed unto and adviſed withal, when bereaved Churches in their Vicinity need their Direction, for a preſent Supply of a Vacancy, and to have Recommended unto them ſuch <hi>Candidates</hi> as the Churches may in due time come to make their <hi>Election</hi> from.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That</hi> the ſeveral <hi>Aſſociations</hi> maintain a due <hi>Correſpondence</hi> with one another, that ſo the <hi>State of Religion</hi> may be the better known and ſerved in the Churches; Yea, if it can be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they may by their <hi>Delegates</hi> meet all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether once in a Year, to concert Matters of a <hi>common Concern</hi> to all the Churches.</p>

And finally, <hi>That</hi> the Miniſters diſpoſed thus to <hi>Aſſociate,</hi> endeavour in the moſt Efficacious Manner they can, to prevail with ſuch Miniſters as unreaſonably neglect ſuch Meetings with their Brethren in proper <hi>Aſſociations;</hi> that they would not expoſe themſelves to the Inconveniencies that ſuch Neglects cannot but be attended with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Propoſals</hi> have not yet been in all regards <hi>univerſally</hi> complied withal.

<q>That the <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Brethren</hi> of the Churches, would meet together in convenient Numbers, at <hi>Set Times,</hi> (which may be left unto the Wiſdom of each Society of Churches,) and thus to enjoy and practiſe <hi>Church-Communion.</hi>
                  </q> And there are added many Directions elaborated by him for the moſt edifying Management of ſuch <hi>ſtated Councils.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>John Owen</hi> alſo in his Treatiſe of a <hi>Goſpel Church,</hi> commends a <hi>conſtant Actual Communion</hi> of the Churches within the Limits of the ſame Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Civil Government, in <hi>Councils.</hi> And he adds,
<q>I cannot ſee how it can be any Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>particular Churches,</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere with any other of their Rights, which they hold by Divine Inſtitution, if through more <hi>conſtant Leſſer Synods</hi> for Advice, there be a Communication of their mutual Concerns, unto thoſe that are <hi>Greater,</hi> until if Occaſion require, and it be expedient, there be a <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> of them all, to adviſe about any thing wherein they are, <hi>all concerned.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Under the Influence of ſuch Thoughts, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be <hi>propoſed,</hi> That the <hi>Aſſociated Paſtors</hi> of every Vicinity, with a proper Number of <hi>other Delegates</hi> (choſen once a Year at leaſt) from their ſeveral Churches, might be formed into <hi>ſtated Councils;</hi> to conſult and adviſe upon ſuch Affairs as might be proper Matter for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Council.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Opinion of Mr. <hi>John Norton</hi> being much received, That SYNODS are ſo neceſſary, <hi>ut Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia ſalutari hoc Remedio non poſſet carere, ſine inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:002775_0198_0FE631828C9A93E8"/>Veritatis, Pietatis, et Concordiae Detrimento;</hi> It was eſteemed a Dictate of common Senſe, that it would be for the Intereſt of <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Piety,</hi> to have the <hi>Remedy</hi> always in <hi>Readineſs;</hi> and put the Churches into ſuch <hi>Order</hi> that they may go moſt regularly and reaſonably to work, in the Application thereof.</p>
               <p>It was alſo conſidered, That when <hi>Councils</hi> are called by <hi>Litigant Parties</hi> in Churches, upon E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergencies, it had been hitherto in the <hi>Liberty</hi> of each <hi>Party,</hi> to Chuſe and Call their own <hi>Council,</hi> where they pleaſed; which left Room for much <hi>Partiality</hi> to operate, and <hi>One Council</hi> to ſucceed and oppoſe <hi>another,</hi> with an <hi>Endleſs Confuſion,</hi> more proper for a <hi>Babel,</hi> than a <hi>City of GOD.</hi> Thro' the Gracious and Watchful Providence of GOD their SAVIOUR, the Churches had not <hi>in Fact</hi> ſeen much of this <hi>Confuſion;</hi> and it may be the <hi>Prudent</hi> Servants of GOD had it more <hi>in Fear</hi> than there was a Real need of. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, 'twas thought that <hi>Prudence</hi> called for a more effectual Proviſion.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, <hi>Stated Councils</hi> being propoſed, the Meeting whereof <hi>once in a Year</hi> was judged little enough; it was now alſo further propoſed, That the <hi>Aſſociation</hi> whereto the <hi>Paſtors</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Council</hi> belonged, may direct when there ſhould be judged an Occaſion for this <hi>Council,</hi> (or <hi>what Part</hi> of it they ſhould think enough) to convene upon an Emergency. And, that the <hi>Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of the <hi>Councils</hi> thus provided for the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of the Churches, were to be looked upon as <hi>Deciſive;</hi> except aggrieved Churches or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have Weighty Reaſons to the <hi>contrary.</hi> But,
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:002775_0199_0FE631EDF09B2938"/>that in <hi>ſuch Caſes</hi> there ſhould be a <hi>further Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> And that the <hi>Council</hi> for that <hi>further Hearing</hi> ſhould conſiſt of <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Churches</hi> more for Number than the former; and ſuch as might be directed and convened by the Miniſters of any <hi>Aſſociation,</hi> that ſhould be near to <hi>that,</hi> whereto thoſe of the <hi>former Council</hi> belonged; unto which the <hi>Aggrieved</hi> were accordingly to apply themſelves, and in this Way to expect a <hi>final Iſſue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such <hi>Propoſals</hi> as theſe found in one of the <hi>New-Engliſh</hi> Colonies a more general Reception (and even a Countenance from the Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment) than in the Reſt. In the other, there were ſome very conſiderable Perſons among the <hi>Miniſters,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Brethren,</hi> who thought the <hi>Liberties</hi> of <hi>particular Churches</hi> to be in danger of being too much <hi>limited</hi> and <hi>infring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> in them. And in a Deference to theſe Good Men, the <hi>Propoſals</hi> were never proſecuted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Bounds of <hi>meer Propoſals.</hi> Accordingly the Churches go on in the <hi>Methods</hi> of which an Account was given, before the Introducing of theſe <hi>Propoſals.</hi> And <hi>Humane Prudence</hi> being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged thus to keep the Stops where it is, the SPIRIT of our SAVIOUR, ſo deſcends with His Operations, that <hi>Councils</hi> rarely miſs of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired Efficacy.</p>
               <p>There was indeed a Satyr, Printed againſt theſe <hi>written Propoſals,</hi> and againſt the Servants of GOD that made them. Nevertheleſs, thoſe <hi>Followers of the Lamb,</hi> remembring the Maxim of, <hi>Not Anſwering,</hi> uſed the Conduct which the Univerſity of <hi>Helmſtadt</hi> lately preſcribed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

               </p>
               <p>§. 7. An Account of the more <hi>General Cuſtoms</hi> uſed in the Churches of <hi>New-England,</hi> has been thus Exhibited. But it muſt be ſaid, they have alſo ſuch <hi>Varieties</hi> of leſſer Circumſtances, that one may with Pleaſure ſay, what <hi>Socrates</hi> reports about the <hi>Various Rites</hi> in the Primitive Churches; <hi>To reckon them all up, would be Difficult, yea, Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is poſſible, that in ſome Churches, the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions may be managed <hi>leſs</hi> Beautifully than we have deſcribed; and in others when the Beauty of the Proceeding may be more equal, yet they may a <hi>little vary</hi> from our Deſcription. However we have kept <hi>very near the Matter,</hi> and with all poſſible Veracity.</p>
               <p>And indeed notable is the Demonſtration, which their <hi>happy Experience</hi> gives them, of the <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Madneſs,</hi> in thoſe <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Politicians,</hi> who will with a <hi>Phaetontic Fury</hi> ſet the World on Fire, to impoſe and inforce their admired <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformity,</hi> in little <hi>Ceremonies</hi> which the <hi>Worſt Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> can conform to, as well as the <hi>Beſt</hi> in the World. Their <hi>Experience</hi> proves what <hi>Gregory</hi> long ſince confeſſed, <hi>In una Fide nihil officit Sanctae Eccleſiae diverſa Conſuetudo;</hi> and what <hi>Irenaeus</hi> long before him obſerved; <hi>A Diverſity</hi> [ΔΙΑΦΟΝΙΑ] <hi>in leſſer Matters, commends a Church preſerving</hi> [ΟΜΟ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ΝΟΙΑΝ] <hi>the Unity of the Faith.</hi>

               <head>ARTICLE X. Special CUSTOMS.</head>
               <p>§. 1. BEſides the more <hi>General</hi> CUSTOMS <hi>of</hi> the Churches, there are a few more <hi>Special</hi> CUSTOMS <hi>in</hi> the Churches, whereof a Brief Recitation may be expected.</p>
               <p>We will begin with the DAYS obſerved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them.</p>
               <p>He that ſhall read the judicious Diſcourſe of <hi>Soerates</hi> (written above Twelve Hundred Years ago) in the <hi>Twenty Firſt</hi> Chapter of his <hi>Fifth</hi> Book, about HOLY DAYS, will ſee very much of what is believed in the Churches of <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> Namely (and briefly,) <hi>That the Apoſtles have ſet the Churches free from the Yoke of Bondage thereunto.</hi> They are far from reviling that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Perſon as an <hi>Heretic</hi> (which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> did) for Complaining there, <hi>That they who contended for Holy Days, deſpiſed the Commandments of GOD.</hi> But they are content themſelves to be <hi>Hereticated,</hi> by the popiſhly affected, for holding, as the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> did, more than Five Hundred Years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, <hi>That Conſtrained and Prefixed Faſts, bound to Days, and all the Rabblement of Rites and Ceremonies, brought in by Man, ought to be aboliſhed.</hi> It was <hi>Luther</hi>'s Deſire near Two Hundred Years ago,
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:002775_0202_0FE6318F871CE858"/>
                  <hi>That there were no other Feſtival Days amongſt Chriſtians, but only the LORD's DAY.</hi> And it was <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Deſire at the ſame Time, <hi>That inaſmuch as Chriſt our Judge, has releaſed us from ſtated Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Days, we may not obey any Morsal, that ſhall go to oblige us thereunto.</hi> According to this <hi>Deſire</hi> is the <hi>Practice</hi> of theſe <hi>American</hi> Churches. And if King <hi>James</hi> once could boaſt of the Purity in the Church of <hi>Scotland, That not ſo much as</hi> Eaſter <hi>or</hi> Chriſtmas <hi>was obſerved in it;</hi> Even ſuch a Boaſt may be humbly made about the Churches of <hi>New-England.</hi> Nor do theſe Churches hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diſcover any <hi>Tendencies</hi> towards a Compliance with that which was one of the earlieſt <hi>Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> and <hi>Superſtitions</hi> in the Primitive Times, (and as Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> calls it, <hi>The firſt Weapon wherewith the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>play'd his Prizes againſt other Churches</hi>) that is, an <hi>impoſed</hi> HOLY DAY. But they rather Cenſure it as a very unadviſed Speech in Dr. <hi>Hammond; That when the Feſtivals are turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the Church, it will not be in the Power of Weekly Sermons, on the Heads of Religion, to keep up the Knowledge of CHRIST in Men's Hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Churches make a Difference between <hi>Taking a Time</hi> to <hi>Do</hi> a <hi>Sacred Work;</hi> and the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> a <hi>Work</hi> to <hi>keep</hi> a <hi>Sacred Time.</hi> To eſteem any <hi>Good Work</hi> the <hi>better</hi> for its being done on ſuch or ſuch a Return of a <hi>Time,</hi> which GOD has not in His Word ſet apart for it, is to make the <hi>Time</hi> itſelf a <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>Worſhip;</hi> and they judge it an unwarrantable thing, for Men ſo to <hi>impoſe</hi> upon Heaven, with their own <hi>Inventions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="188" facs="unknown:002775_0203_0FE6318F8ABE4268"/>
The Churches look upon Solemn HUMILI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ATIONS and THANKSGIVINGS, as <hi>Moral Duties,</hi> to be obſerved <hi>Pro Cauſis et Temporibus:</hi> And therefore they regard the <hi>Directions of Divine Providence,</hi> in laying before them the <hi>freſh Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens</hi> thereof; which could not ſo well be done, if they were made <hi>perpetual.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>Beginning</hi> of the Year the GOVER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOUR with the Advice of the <hi>Council,</hi> (&amp; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo at the Motion of the Repreſentatives) publiſhes a <hi>Proclamation</hi> directing ſuch a Day, as he with <hi>them</hi> thinks fit, for Solemn <hi>Humiliations,</hi> with <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Faſting,</hi> to obtain a <hi>Bleſſing</hi> on the Affairs of the Year enſuing.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Concluſion,</hi> the GOVERNOUR, upon the Advice and Motion aforeſaid, publiſhes a <hi>Proclamation,</hi> ſpecifying a Day for Solemn <hi>Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings,</hi> on the Account of <hi>Mercies</hi> received in the foregoing Year.</p>
               <p>The Miniſters read theſe <hi>Proclamations</hi> in their Congregations, on ſome LORD's DAY before the Days thus called for; and often with agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Speeches</hi> prepare their People for the <hi>Duties</hi> of them.</p>
               <p>In theſe <hi>Proclamations</hi> there is inſerted a Clauſe, <hi>Inhibiting all Servile Labour</hi> on the <hi>Days</hi> appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and the <hi>Days</hi> are accordingly obſerved, with a ſtrict Application to the <hi>Proper Duties</hi> of them; yea, obſerved as <hi>Extraordinary Sabbaths.</hi> Not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Days of <hi>Humiliation</hi> are ſo, but the Days of <hi>Thankſgiving</hi> alſo: It may be, there are no <hi>Days of Thankſgiving</hi> any where on the Face of the Earth, kept in ſo <hi>Religious,</hi> and <hi>Sabbatizing</hi>
                  <pb n="189" facs="unknown:002775_0204_0FE631914544EC38"/>a Manner, as they are in the Churches of <hi>New-England.</hi> There are no ſuch Ringing of <hi>Bells,</hi> and making of <hi>Bonfires,</hi> and other <hi>Frolicks,</hi> as there are on ſuch Occaſions in ſome of our <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean</hi> Churches. And may they be forever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from ſuch Profanations!</p>
               <p>As other <hi>extraordinary Occaſions</hi> do occur, at any other time of the Year, the <hi>Civil Authority</hi> takes a like Notice of them.</p>
               <p>And it is a very frequent thing, for particular <hi>Paſtors</hi> with their <hi>Churches,</hi> to keep <hi>Solemn Days</hi> in their own Congregations, as they ſee Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for them; without any Direction from the <hi>Civil Authority.</hi> So <hi>Cyprian</hi> in a Time of Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; <hi>Ad placandum atque exorandum Dominum,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Non Voce ſola, ſed et Jejuniis et Lacrymis, et om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni genere Deprecationis ingemiſcamus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, Sometimes the <hi>Paſtors</hi> in a <hi>Vicinity</hi> agree to keep the <hi>Wheel</hi> of their Devotions in a <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Motion,</hi> by ſuch <hi>Days</hi> kept <hi>ſucceſſively</hi> in their ſeveral Congregations; wherein they enjoy much <hi>Communion</hi> with and <hi>Aſſiſtence</hi> from one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. Thus <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells, That in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Times, the <hi>Biſhops</hi> did <hi>ordain Faſts for the Churches,</hi> ex aliqua Solicitudinis Eccleſiaſticae Cauſa, <hi>according as the Troubleſome Circumſtances of the Church called for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes one particular Church, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Number of Conſociated Churches in a Neighbourhood ſucceſſively, have ſet apart whole <hi>Days of Prayer,</hi> on this peculiar Intention; To pray for a <hi>Succeſsful Miniſtry;</hi> and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, to obtain it, that the <hi>Spirit of Grace</hi> would infuſe a <hi>Principle of Piety,</hi> into the Hearts of the
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:002775_0205_0FE63191499C3480"/>
                  <hi>Riſing Generation,</hi> and by a mighty Effect of His Goſpel upon them, render their Children a <hi>Pious Generation.</hi> A marvellous Efficacy of the Goſpel in a <hi>Converſion</hi> of <hi>Young People</hi> unto ſerious Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and an <hi>Addition</hi> unto the Churches of <hi>them that ſhall be ſaved,</hi> have been obſerved among the <hi>Conſequences</hi> of ſuch an Action.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Beloved Paſtors</hi> have been taken <hi>Sick,</hi> their Churches, Viſited and Affiſted by the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Paſtors, have kept their <hi>Days of Prayer</hi> for them: And it has been rarely known, that ſuch <hi>Paſtors</hi> have not been remarkably Recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Solemn and public <hi>Thankſgivings</hi> have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times followed.</p>
               <p>Some Churches bleſſed with excellent <hi>Paſtors,</hi> have kept their <hi>Days of Thankſgiving</hi> for their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Enjoyments; [Aſſiſted with Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Paſtors, on theſe Occaſions.] It has been very agreeable, to ſee with what Ingenuity the Humble and Modeſt Paſtors have behaved themſelves, when ſuch <hi>Roſes</hi> have been caſt upon them. One by whom <hi>Cambridge</hi> was once illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated, on ſuch a Day, Preached on, 2 Cor. XII. 11. <hi>I am Nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When Days of <hi>Humiliation</hi> or of <hi>Thankſgiving</hi> have been obſerved, it has been a frequent thing, for <hi>Collections</hi> of Money for <hi>Pious Uſes</hi> to be made in the Aſſemblies; That ſo it might be ſaid, <hi>Thy Prayers and thy Alms are come up for a Memorial be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Zeal</hi> of GOD, and the <hi>Spirit of the Goſpel,</hi> operating in the Churches, has diſpoſed them to make ſeveral noble Efforts, for the <hi>Propagation of</hi> (not <hi>Party,</hi> but <hi>Pure and Undefiled) Religion,</hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="unknown:002775_0206_0FE631954714BA98"/>and the <hi>Goſpellizing</hi> of Plantations which have been the <hi>Unwatered Places of the Wicked One.</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous <hi>Collections</hi> have been made in the <hi>Churches,</hi> to ſupport the Expences of ſending <hi>Miſſionaries</hi> to ſuch Places, and building <hi>Meeting-Houſes</hi> in them. And the Gentlemen who <hi>Deviſe Liberal Things,</hi> have alſo more privately advanced Sums of Money on ſuch Occaſions and Intentions. <hi>Aſſociated Paſtors</hi> have been at the Head of theſe Actions; And the <hi>Succeſs</hi> has not been Contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible; tho' the Inviſible <hi>Rulers of the Darkneſs of this World,</hi> have ſenſibly enough done their Part for the Clogging of ſuch Undertakings.</p>
               <p>There has been offered unto the Churches, A <hi>Propoſal,</hi> for an EVANGELICAL TREASURY, to be Raiſed by <hi>Collections</hi> on the Days of <hi>Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> and of <hi>Thankſgiving</hi> (which are kept eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Year) in the <hi>Congregations</hi> of the Country; and lodged in the Hands of <hi>Truſtees,</hi> who are to lay it out ſtill with the <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Conſent</hi> of the Churches to which it belongs. The <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Intention</hi> of it, <hi>The Propagation of Religion;</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when Good is to be done in <hi>Ungoſpellized Places;</hi> But alſo, For any <hi>Pious Uſes,</hi> which any <hi>particular Church</hi> may ſee Cauſe to purſue, within their own Vicinity. The <hi>Propoſal,</hi> is in the <hi>United Churches</hi> of <hi>Boſton</hi> begun to be Proſecuted and Executed.</p>
               <p>§. 2. 'Tis uſual among us, for Chriſtians to uphold PRIVATE MEETINGS, wherein they do with various Exerciſes <hi>Edify one another;</hi> and it is not eaſy to reckon up the <hi>Varieties</hi> uſed in them. 'Tis obſerved, That the <hi>Power of Godlineſs</hi>
                  <pb n="192" facs="unknown:002775_0207_0FE631954B724858"/>ordinarily prevails in a Place, as the PRIVATE MEETINGS are duly kept up and carried on.</p>
               <p>Sometimes a <hi>Dozen Families</hi> more or leſs, agree to meet in a <hi>Courſe,</hi> at one anothers Houſes, on a <hi>Day,</hi> and at an <hi>Hour,</hi> agreed on, once a <hi>Fortnight</hi> or once a <hi>Month,</hi> as they ſhall pleaſe. And the <hi>Families</hi> unto whoſe <hi>Turn</hi> it falls to entertain the Reſt, ſometimes takes that Opportunity, to invite others of their Neighbours unto the Religious Entertainments of their Houſes.</p>
               <p>They ſometimes have the Company of a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,</hi> who ſpends an Hour or Two in a <hi>Prayer</hi> and a <hi>Sermon</hi> with them. And the <hi>Candidates</hi> of the Miniſtry ſometimes do at theſe Meetings perform ſome of their firſt <hi>Probationary Exerciſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Otherwiſe, One of the <hi>Brethren</hi> makes a <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;</hi> and one reads a <hi>Sermon,</hi> either Printed in a Book, or taken by the <hi>Pen of a ready Writer</hi> in the public Aſſemblies: And they cloſe the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe with <hi>Singing</hi> of <hi>Pſalms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
