            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>1 CHRONICLES xxix. 11.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <p>— Thine is the KINGDOM, O LORD, and thou art ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted as HEAD above ALL.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN the paſſage which has now been read, we have the devout acknowledgment of king David, who was the firſt magiſtrate, in the moſt reſpectable kingdom, which, at that time, exiſted. He was as remarkable for piety and religion, as for emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence and diſtinction, in the Jewiſh nation.</p>
            <p>IT was not an inconſiderable evidence, of the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of his piety, that he maintained the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted and reverential conceptions of God, in the height of earthly magnificence, amid the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and pomp of a Court, which ſo commonly
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:036380_0005_1008F6AEBA62ABA8"/>
dazzle the eyes of mankind, and plunge them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſcenes of voluptuouſneſs.</p>
            <p>NEBUCHADNEZZAR, who was at the head of the Chaldean Empire, was ſo intoxicated, with the ſplendors of royalty, that <hi>"his heart was lifted up and his mind hardened in pride,"</hi> ſo that he did not know and conſider, <hi>"That the MOST HIGH ruleth in the kingdom of men."</hi> And, fact and experience afford the moſt convincing evidence, that worldly diſtinctions and honors, through the native corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the human heart, have a moſt powerful tendency to render men unmindful of Him, by whom "kings reign and princes decree juſtice." But, this was very far from being exemplified in David. Although, from a ſhepherd, he was raiſed to a throne, and exalted as the head of a reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and truly great nation, which always reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his authority; yet, he did not, through pride of heart, ſo rate his dignity and worldly conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, as to think it beneath him, devoutly to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge God, as the Supreme Ruler of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. He was ſenſible, that his elevated ſtation and worldly magnificence, were the fruit and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, of God's ſovereign diſpoſal. In the text, he moſt devoutly aſcribes every thing to Him. "Thine is the <hi>kingdom,</hi> O LORD, and thou art exalted as <hi>head</hi> above ALL." And, in the ſucceeding words, "Both <hi>riches</hi> and <hi>honors</hi> come of thee—in thine
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:036380_0006_1008F6B16AD462D0"/>hand it is to <hi>make</hi> great, and to give <hi>ſtrength</hi> unto all."</p>
            <p>IT may be further obſerved, that king David was not only ready, moſt ſolemnly to acknowledge, the <hi>exiſtence</hi> of God; but he viewed and reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him "as head above all." Not as the proph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et Elijah ſarcaſtically deſcribed Baal, as an <hi>idle talker,</hi> or as <hi>purſuing a journey,</hi> or as <hi>ſleeping</hi>; or, in a word, as being an <hi>idle</hi> and <hi>unconcerned ſpectator</hi> of the world; but as being particularly concerned in the government and control of the univerſe.—"Thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou art exalted as head above all."</p>
            <p>THE text will naturally direct our attention, to the two following things.</p>
            <p n="1">I. THE <hi>nature</hi> of that <hi>kingdom,</hi> which is ſaid, in the text, to be the LORD's.</p>
            <p n="2">II. IN what ſenſe the kingdom may be ſaid to be the LORD's, and that He is exalted as HEAD above all.</p>
            <p>IT is hoped, that in the proſecution of what has now been propoſed, ſuch obſervations and remarks will be made, as will render the diſcourſe both ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and pertinent to this public anniverſary.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:036380_0007_1008F6B3BA379C38"/>I. IT is propoſed, to attend to the <hi>nature</hi> of that kingdom, which, in the text, is ſaid to be the LORD's.</p>
            <p>THE inhabitants of this world, are divided into many kingdoms and governments, which, in the ſacred ſcriptures, are called "the kingdom of men." But that kingdom which is ſaid, in the text, to be the LORD's, has not a reſpect to any <hi>one</hi> of thoſe kingdoms, in excluſion of the reſt.</p>
            <p>THE time has been, indeed, when God took upon himſelf the government of the Hebrews; and, in his diſpenſations, a very ſpecial reſpect was paid them. His adminiſtrations were particularly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, to the eſtabliſhment of that <hi>favorite</hi> people; yet God was, at the ſame time, as truly at the head of other nations, and did diſpoſe of and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintend all their affairs, in the ſame manner that he did the affairs and concerns of the Jews. God had purpoſes to anſwer, relative to the Jewiſh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which he had not reſpecting other nations; for they were a <hi>choſen people.</hi> Although the allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, to other nations, were ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the advancement of the Hebrews, yet, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents were alloted out to the former, in as <hi>immediate</hi> and <hi>efficient</hi> a manner as they were to the latter. The purpoſes of God, reſpecting different nations, have been different; yet God has not at the preſent time, nor ever had in time paſt, a more immediate
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:036380_0008_1008F6B577D7B720"/>
diſpoſal of the affairs of one nation than of anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. The kingdom, which in the text is called the LORD's, is not limited by or confined to any earthly kingdom.</p>
            <p>BUT, the kingdom which is the Lord's does, in a ſenſe, embrace the <hi>univerſe</hi>; conſiſting of all ranks and grades of creatures, throughout all worlds. The government of God extends to all things, both animate and inanimate. All the worlds and creatures which God hath made, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute one ſyſtem. The various orders of exiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, from the archangel to the moſt inconſiderable inſect, conſtitute the links of a perfect chain, and are like wheels which are neceſſary to complete a perfect machine. They are all neceſſary to form a perfect ſyſtem. And, as the Lord is "exalted as head above all," ſo all things which exiſt, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in his kingdom. God manages every part of the univerſe, in ſuch a manner, as ſhall beſt anſwer the purpoſes which he had in view, when he brought them into being.</p>
            <p>THE ſacred ſcriptures teach us, thus to conſider the <hi>extent</hi> of the kingdom which is the Lord's. In them, God is ſaid to rule among the nations—to build them up or pluck them down at what inſtant he pleaſes. Famine, peſtilence and the ſword are
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:036380_0009_1008F6B8961C3F70"/>ſaid to be under his control. It is God who bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances the clouds, and gives the former and the latter rain in their ſeaſon. And it is further aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, that the ſuperintending care and diſpoſing hand of God are concerned, even in the falling of the ſparrow to the ground. The kingdom which is the Lord's, therefore, comprehends the univerſe. Hence, in the text, God is ſaid to be "exalted as HEAD above ALL,"—above every thing which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts.</p>
            <p>AGAIN; to our having proper apprehenſions of the kingdom which is the LORD's, it is neceſſary to bring into view not only its <hi>extent,</hi> but the <hi>object</hi> or <hi>end</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>GOD does not exerciſe a control over the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and concern himſelf with the affairs of all ranks of creatures, as a mere <hi>amuſement</hi>; he has an important object in view, in all his adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and, that is to raiſe up and eſtabliſh a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>holineſs and righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE government of God does conſiſt, ſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, in ſo conducting and arranging events, as ſhall, eventually, advance the ſpiritual and moral good of the univerſe, or eſtabliſh a holy and ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itual kingdom. All the plans, inſtitutions and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erations of God are directed to that end. The end
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:036380_0010_1008F6BC6B157AE0"/>of the natural is the moral world. As all the ranks and orders of exiſtencies are to be conſidered, as ſo many links of a perfect chain, ſo all the <hi>events</hi> which take place, and all God's appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and inſtitutions are to be viewed, as ſo many means to advance the moral and ſpiritual good, or the holineſs and happineſs of intelligent beings; and ſo to eſtabliſh and perfect a kingdom of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and righteouſneſs. And, all being united, do form a perfect ſyſtem of means and events, for the ſecurity of ſo important an object.—As the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement and eſtabliſhment of a kingdom of righteouſneſs require, God builds up or pulls down earthly kingdoms. The great Monarchies of the world, which have been raiſed up and again tumbled into ruin, have been ſubordinated to this intereſting deſign. The conſtitution and laws of the natural world, when they ceaſe to contribute to the eſtabliſhment of ſuch a kingdom, will be aboliſhed; yea, the whole natural world, when it ſhall have accompliſhed every thing of that nature which it can anſwer, will be conſigned over to deſtruction. Events will roll on until a holy and ſpiritual kingdom ſhall be eſtabliſhed and become triumphant. Then, the rotation of events, like the preſent, ſhall ceaſe. Earthly kingdoms and empires ſhall ſink into ruin—the ſun ſhall ſhine no more, the various parts of the natural world ſhall be unhinged—a univerſal conflagration will
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:036380_0011_1008F6BDF8DB6F68"/>take place, and former things ſhall be remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no more.</p>
            <p>THAT this repreſentation, of the object of God's government, is real and not imaginary, appears from many conſiderations, which can be but very briefly mentioned, at this time.</p>
            <p>IT appears, very particularly, from the deſign of the incarnation and ſacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt; or the introduction of the mediatorial plan.</p>
            <p>THIS great event is conſidered, in the ſacred wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, as above all others calculated, to anſwer the purpoſes, which God had in view, in the whole work of creation and the government of the world. And, the end which God had in view in that aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing event was, indubitably, the eſtabliſhment of a kingdom of holineſs. Hence it is ſaid, that he "gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us <hi>from all iniquity,</hi> and <hi>purify</hi> unto himſelf a <hi>peculiar people, zealous of good works.</hi>"<note n="*" place="bottom">Titus ii.14.</note> And the church is ſaid to be redeemed by his blood, "to the intent, that now unto the principalities and powers, in heavenly places might be known, by the <hi>Church,</hi> the manifold wiſdom of God; according to the <hi>eternal purpoſe</hi> which he purpoſed in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord."<note n="†" place="bottom">Epheſ. iii.10, 11.</note> And, Jeſus Chriſt is now exalted at
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:036380_0012_1008F6C06DEFD3A0"/>the head of all principalities and powers, and will reign until all enemies are brought at his footſtool. And the iſſue of this great affair is ſummed up in this, that God ſhall "reconcile all things to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by him, whether they be things in earth or things in heaven." From theſe paſſages of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as well as from the declarations and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies concerning the increaſe, progreſs and iſſue of the kingdom of Chriſt, which is founded in his blood, it is extremely evident, that the end God had in view, in the incarnation, death and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Jeſus Chriſt, and in the whole work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, was the advancement and eſtabliſhment of a kingdom of holineſs and righteouſneſs. And, from thence we may certainly infer, that this is the great object, which God has in view in his whole government.</p>
            <p>THE ſame concluſion becomes further evident, from the end, which God has in view, in the <hi>reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious inſtitutions</hi> he hath made. The end propoſed in inſtitutions of a religious nature, is, unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, to render mankind holy and ſpiritual.</p>
            <p>AGAIN; that the end God has in view, and that the object of his government is, the eſtabliſhment of a kingdom of righteouſneſs is evident, from the great and fundamental laws of his kingdom; or, from what he chiefly requires, of his intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:036380_0013_1008F6C2F21CC7F8"/>creatures. God's requirements are all ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up in holineſs and righteouſneſs—in univerſal love and good will. This clearly indicates what that is, at which God is aiming in his government; and, particularly, that it is the advancement of a kingdom of righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>THAT the eſtabliſhment of a kingdom of right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs, is the great object of the government of God, appears, not only, from the end propoſed in the work of redemption, in all religious inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and from the requirement of the laws he has eſtabliſhed; but, it is alſo evident, from the deſign of civil government.</p>
            <p>CIVIL government was not inſtituted, merely to amuſe men; nor, to lift up ſome over the heads of others, without propoſing an important object. And, although it is an inſtitution, which is pecul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iar to this world, and may ſeem more immediately deſigned to protect men from injury and violence; yet, Is it not certain, that like the other inſtitutions of God, it is ultimately deſigned for and to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered, with a view to the advancement and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhment of a ſpiritual and holy kingdom?</p>
            <p>I AM not inſenſible, that ſome are fond of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a total ſeparation between civil government and the protection or eſtabliſhment of religion, or
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:036380_0014_1008F6C61C2569F0"/>the advancement of a ſpiritual kingdom; and do even conſider the former as having nothing to do with the latter. But, I beg leave to inquire, Whether the proſperity and advancement of a kingdom of holineſs and righteouſneſs among men, be not the great object of civil government? And, whether every civil conſtitution, which is not ultimately calculated to nouriſh and cheriſh true religion, and ſo to advance a ſpiritual and holy kingdom, be not, in the view of God, whatever it be in the view of man, not merely <hi>cenſurable,</hi> but abſolutely <hi>abominable</hi>? Take a retroſpect of the antient diſpenſations of God, and you will ſee, how God views civil governments and adminiſtrations in this reſpect. Is it not evident, from the paſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of God, that he approved or cenſured civil governments, according to the reſpect or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect paid by them, to his church and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of a kingdom of holineſs? This was certainly the caſe, reſpecting the adminiſtrations of the kings of Iſrael. This was alſo the caſe, reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the Chaldean monarchy. It is the very reaſon offered, why God brought ruin on that mighty empire. It was becauſe it rejoiced in the ruin, and was inſtrumental in deſtroying the heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of God. The vengeance of God was, alſo, denounced upon the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> upon <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Seir,</hi> upon <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> for their oppoſition to and deriſion of the church of God. We are, alſo, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:036380_0015_1008F6C7A4104108"/>that it will always be thus, that God will pull down kingdoms and utterly deſtroy them, when they ſtand in the way to the proſperity and advancement of his church, or a kingdom of right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs.</p>
            <p>IT may here be ſaid, that there are none, who ſuppoſe, that civil government and adminiſtrations are to <hi>oppoſe</hi> the advancement of a ſpiritual king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or the progreſs of religion; all which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for is, that civil government ſhould be <hi>neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral.</hi> But, in anſwer, it may be aſked, Whether it be poſſible that civil government ſhould take ſuch a poſition? Our Saviour aſſerts, "He that is not with me is againſt me: and he that gathereth not with me ſcattereth abroad."<note n="*" place="bottom">Matth. xii.30.</note> There is according to theſe words of Chriſt, no ſuch thing as neutral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. And this is as true, reſpecting civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as reſpecting an individual. A mere neglect to countenance and ſupport religion, or a kingdom of righteouſneſs, in a civil adminiſtration, will op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate againſt it. It was always ſuppoſed of old, that the conduct of rulers, or their adminiſtrations, had a very great influence on the religious ſtate and character of the Jews. It is impoſſible, therefore, that civil government ſhould take a neutral poſition, reſpecting religion or a kingdom of holineſs. It
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:036380_0016_1008F6C9ED026E30"/>muſt aid and countenance it, or it will diſcourage and bring it into contempt.</p>
            <p>WITHOUT attempting, particularly, to point out what aid or ſupport civil government may and ought to give, to religion or the Church of Chriſt, I would only further obſerve, that the ſacred ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do teach, in a very direct manner, that civil government is deſigned by God, ultimately, as a mean and expedient to advance religion, or a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of righteouſneſs among men. Is it not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and poſitively aſſerted, by the prophet Iſaiah, that in a future period, when civil government ſhall be rightly applied and faithfully adminiſtered, "Kings ſhall be nurſing fathers and their Queens nurſing mothers," to the Church of God? And, does not the apoſtle Paul moſt expreſsly teach us, what the end of civil government and magiſtracy is?<note n="*" place="bottom">Romans xiii.3—5.</note> 
               <q>
                  <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers are not a</hi> terror to good works, <hi>but</hi> to the evil. <hi>Do that which is</hi> good, <hi>and thou ſhalt have</hi> praiſe of the ſame, <hi>for he is the miniſter of God to thee</hi> for good. <hi>He beareth not the</hi> ſword in vain; <hi>for he is the miniſter of God</hi>—a revenger to <hi>to execute</hi> wrath upon him that doeth evil.</q> Does not this account of the deſign of civil government and magiſtracy, clearly teach, that they were deſigned to encourage and ſupport a kingdom of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:036380_0017_1008F6CBEDCBB1A0"/>righteouſneſs among men? And, the ſame apoſtle directs, "<hi>that prayers, interceſſions, and giving of thanks be made—for</hi> kings <hi>and for</hi> all that are in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, <hi>that we may lead quiet and peaceable lives,</hi> in all godlineſs and honeſty."<note n="†" place="bottom">1 Tim. ii.1, 2.</note> It muſt be clear, from what is ſaid concerning the deſign of civil government, in the ſacred ſcriptures, that it was inſtituted as a mean, to advance and ſupport a kingdom of holineſs and righteouſneſs: And, therefore, it is one thing which ſerves to point us, to the great object which God has in view in his government; or the nature and deſign of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>AGAIN; the uſe and improvement, which God requires us to make of the various allotments of his providence, farther point out the end of his government, or the nature of his kingdom; and that it is a kingdom of righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>THE improvement God requires us to make of providence is this, that we grow in righteouſneſs and holineſs. The goodneſs of God is to lead us to repentance. Under adverſities, we are to "learn righteouſneſs." Or, to adopt the language of an apoſtle, when ſpeaking of trials and adverſities, he ſays they are ſent "that we may be partakers of his holineſs." Now if our holineſs, be the end of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:036380_0018_1008E3AE4216BAA0"/>divine allotments, it becomes evident, that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of a kingdom of holineſs, is the end of God's adminiſtrations.</p>
            <p>THE ſame truth will appear with additional clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if we turn our attention, to the particular deſigns of God, and his providential diſpenſations, as they are ſtated in the ſacred ſcriptures.</p>
            <p>IF we take a view of events under the former diſpenſation, we muſt ſee, that the eſtabliſhment of a holy and ſpiritual kingdom was, uniformly, the object which God had in view in all his allotments. It is evident, that his Church was kept conſtantly in view, as the chief object of attention. God ſet up the Church as his great object. This appears, incontrovertibly true, not only relative to thoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations, which reſpected the Jews in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; but the affairs of all other nations, were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinated to the proſperity and advancement of the Church. Whole nations were exterminated and utterly deſtroyed, as the proſperity of the Church demanded. God conducted and diſpoſed, not only, of the affairs of the Jews, but of all the nations around them, with a direct and immediate refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to the enlargement and proſperity of his Church. Of this, no one can doubt, who has at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the hiſtory of God's proceedings, as they are ſtated in his word. Which point us directly to
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:036380_0019_1008F6D1B7644C40"/>a kingdom of righteouſneſs, as the object of God's government.</p>
            <p>FARTHERMORE, the declarations and prophecies contained in the ſacred ſcriptures, relative to the <hi>future</hi> diſpenſations of God, point us to the ſame object.—They are all aimed at the advancement of a kingdom of righteouſneſs, as the great object which God has in view.</p>
            <p>GOD has actually decreed that all other kingdoms ſhall come to an utter end—That his ſpiritual kingdom "ſhall break in pieces and conſume all other kingdoms, and it ſhall ſtand forever." And that, as the great Monarchies which have already exiſted, have, one after another, been utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, to make way for the enlargement of his Church, and the advancement of his ſpiritual king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſo it ſhall be hereafter. Although God may ſuffer the powers of this world, to trample on his Church, for a ſeaſon; yet He aſſures us, that "the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it"—That he will ſuffer the wrath and madneſs of men to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no further, than ſhall be neceſſary, to prepare the way for its eſtabliſhment. "The wrath of man ſhall praiſe thee, the remainder of wrath wilt thou reſtrain." And, we are further aſſured, that ſuch will be the allotments or providence, and that the affairs of all nations ſhall be ſo over-ruled, as
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:036380_0020_1008F6D4F7DE9CC0"/>that, eventually, "The earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of the Lord"—That the corrupt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of men, which are naturally ſo violent and overbearing, ſhall be ſoftened down, ſo that noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhall hurt or deſtroy, in all God's holy moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain—That all ſhall know him "from the leaſt to the greateſt."</p>
            <p>HENCE it appears, that the great object, which God has kept in view, in former diſpenſations, and which he will keep conſtantly in view in his future, is the advancement and eſtabliſhment of a ſpiritual and holy kingdom.</p>
            <p>BUT one conſideration more will be ſuggeſted, to ſhow that the end of the kingdom, which is the LORD's, is the eſtabliſhment of a kingdom of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and righteouſneſs, and that is the <hi>reſult and final iſſue</hi> of his adminiſtrations.</p>
            <p>IN what the adminiſtrations of God, or the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious diſpenſations of providence will end, we have full information in the ſacred ſcriptures: and infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation can be derived from no other ſource. We are clearly informed, by the word of God, that one event after another ſhall roll on, 'till all God's deſigns are completed—that in the end of the world, the whole number of the righteous ſhall be gathered together, into one ſociety—that the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:036380_0021_1008F6D7F22CF498"/>ſhall be ſeparated from them, with every one that "loveth and maketh a lie." So that the righteous will form, a perfectly holy and pure ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.—We are further informed, from the oracles of God, that when all the righteous ſhall be gath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered in, from out of every nation under heaven, the ends and the purpoſes of God, in all preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſpenſations, will be attained—that there will be no further employment for the kingdoms and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this world—that the wicked, although they have been improved as inſtruments to accomplish the purpoſes of God, will be improved no longer; but will be turned down into deſtruction, from which they will never be recovered—and, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial world, the earth with all its apparatus, which has ſerved as a theatre on which the affairs of God's kingdom, while in an infantile ſtate, have been tranſacted, (when the righteous are all gathered in,) will be of no further uſe; and, therefore, will be ſubjected to abſolute deſtruction.—"The heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens ſhall be rolled together as a ſcroll," and "ſhall paſs away with a great noiſe: and the elements ſhall melt with fervent heat."—National diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions ſhall be known no more—the ſceptres of kings and the ſwords of magiſtrates ſhall be laid aſide—the ſun ſhall withdraw its ſhining, and the moon will be turned into darkneſs—"the earth and the works that are therein ſhall be burnt up;" and there will be no more remembrance of former
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:036380_0022_1008F6DA6378B428"/>things. The grand drama will then be cloſed.—From a conſideration of the final reſult of things we learn, with the utmoſt certainty, that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which God ever had in view was, the eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment of a kingdom of holineſs.</p>
            <p>THUS the deſign of Chriſt's incarnation—of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and civil inſtitutions—the requirements made in the law of God, of moral and intelligent beings—the improvement to be made of providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial diſpenſations;—together with the final reſult or concluſion of things, when a holy and pure ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhall be formed and rendered triumphant; all theſe various conſiderations unite, in pointing out to us, that the great object of God's government is, the formation and eſtabliſhment of a ſpiritual and holy kingdom.</p>
            <p>ALTHOUGH ſo much has already been ſaid, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the kingdom which is the Lord's, one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation more muſt be added, which is, that the important ends and purpoſes of that kingdom, are to be ſecured, through the medium of the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial plan, and under the adminiſtration of Jeſus Chriſt, as mediatorial king.</p>
            <p>IN illuſtration of this truth I ſhall only obſerve, that the ſacred ſcriptures very expreſsly teach us, that in conſequence of Chriſt's faithfulneſs, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:036380_0023_1008F6DBF222B780"/>the work of redemption, God did inveſt him with kingly authority, and impowered him to call in and train up for glory, all thoſe that were given him. And the affairs of angels as well as of men were committed into his hands. Accordingly we read, that when Chriſt was raiſed from the dead, God "ſet him at his own right hand, in the heavenly places, far above all principality, and power, and might and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but alſo in that which is to come: and hath put all things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet, and gave him to be HEAD over all things to the church."<note n="*" place="bottom">Epheſ.i.20—22.</note> And, in another place, concerning Chriſt it is ſaid, "Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God, angels, authorities and powers being made ſubject to him."<note n="†" place="bottom">1 Peter iii.22.</note> We are further aſſured, that in the courſe of his government, he will "reconcile all things to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, whether they be things in earth or things in heaven." Which imports, that Chriſt will unite, in one ſociety, the ſinleſs angels and elect men. The apoſtle Paul expreſsly aſſerts, that his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom will not be delivered up, 'till "he ſhall have put down all rule, and all authority and power: for he muſt reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet.—And, when all things ſhall be ſubdued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, then ſhall the ſon be alſo ſubject unto him, that put all things under him, that God may be all in all."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:036380_0024_1008F6DE50EB0630"/>WITHOUT any comment on theſe paſſages, thus much muſt be evidently taught in them, that the great purpoſes of God in his univerſal government, in erecting and eſtabliſhing a kingdom of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, will be accompliſhed, under the reign and by the adminiſtration of Jeſus Chriſt, as mediatorial king; or through the medium of the Chriſtian ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>FROM the foregoing obſervations it appears, that the kingdom which is the LORD's, is one which is <hi>univerſal</hi>—extending to <hi>all things</hi> throughout all worlds. The <hi>end</hi> of it is, to raiſe up and eſtabliſh a kingdom of perfect holineſs and happineſs—the great object is to be ſecured, under the reign and through the adminiſtration of Jeſus Chriſt, as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorial king. I now proceed,</p>
            <p n="2">II. To conſider, in what ſenſe the kingdom may be ſaid to be the LORD's, and that He is exalted as HEAD above all.</p>
            <p>As great brevity will be obſerved, in attending to this inquiry, as its importance will admit.</p>
            <p n="1">1. IT may be proper to obſerve, that ſuch aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criptions and acknowledgments, as thoſe contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our text, very frequently occur in the ſacred ſcriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:036380_0025_1008F6E22A92CDC0"/>THE pious pſalmiſt ſays, "The Lord reigneth, let the earth rejoice, and the multitude of iſles be glad." Our Saviour, in that form of prayer which he gave his diſciples, taught them always to pray, "<hi>Thy kingdom come:</hi>" and to conclude in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; "For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory." And he enjoined it on his diſciples, to live in a firm <hi>belief</hi> of the <hi>agency</hi> of God, as being concerned in the moſt minute events—that a ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row does not fall to the ground, without their heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enly Father.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE propriety of its being ſaid in the text, that the kingdom is the LORD's, and that He is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted as HEAD above all, appears from his being the <hi>maker,</hi> and ſo the original <hi>owner</hi> and <hi>proprietor</hi> of all things.</p>
            <p>THE univerſe, comprehending all worlds and creatures, owes its exiſtence to God. The higheſt archangel is as dependent on God, for being, as the meaneſt inſect. This being the caſe, the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is the Lord's. All the kingdoms <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the earth are the. Lord's, as he raiſed them up. Kings and magiſtrates, and all who are in authority are the Lord's, as he has inveſted them with all that power and authority which they poſſeſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. IT is with propriety, that the kingdom is ſaid to be the LORD's, and that He is exalted as HEAD
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:036380_0026_1008F6E3B3CF61C8"/>above all, as He is, moſt certainly the <hi>rightful</hi> ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and governor of the univerſe.</p>
            <p>THE Lord, who made and upholds all things, has, certainly, an original right to diſpoſe of them, according to his good pleaſure. He muſt have a right to do what he will with his own. He muſt have an original and excluſive right, to turn every wheel in government, and to aſcertain every event, ſo as to accompliſh his own purpoſes.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I SHALL only obſerve further, That the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is the LORD's, and that He is exalted as HEAD above all, not only as he is the <hi>maker</hi> and <hi>proprietor</hi> of all, and ſo has an original and independent <hi>right</hi> to reign; but as he does, in fact, exerciſe a government over the whole univerſe, comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all creatures and all events.</p>
            <p>INDEED, if God did not conſtantly exerciſe his Almighty power and ſuperintending care over the univerſe, it would immediately ceaſe to exiſt. That ſame power which <hi>created</hi> can, alone, <hi>uphold</hi> the things which are made. The abſolute and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant dependance of all things on God, renders it certain, that he muſt be "exalted as head above all"—that he muſt rule over the whole univerſe.</p>
            <p>SOME have, indeed, repreſented it as too tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling a buſineſs, for the Supreme Being, to concern
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:036380_0027_1008F6E78798E2A0"/>himſelf with the affairs of creatures; and, had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſider God, only as an unconcerned and unintereſted ſpectator of the affairs of the world.</p>
            <p>BUT ſuch may be aſked, Why God did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the <hi>creation</hi> of the univerſe as too trifling a buſineſs for him to undertake! If it be now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath his notice and care, it was beneath him to exerciſe his wiſdom in contriving, and his power in giving it exiſtence.</p>
            <p>WE can hardly conceive it to be poſſible, that God ſhould bring ſuch a univerſe into being—that he ſhould construct ſuch a complicated ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine as the natural world; and introduce into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, intelligent and moral beings, with capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for immortal happineſs, without propoſing ſome important end in it. If God had an important end originally in view, we may be aſſured, that he will concern himſelf, ſo far, in the affairs of the univerſe, as to order and arrange events, in ſuch a manner, as to ſecure it. Either God had or he had not an important end, in creating the univerſe. If he had not ſome important object in view, Why did he make the worlds which now exiſt? Was it for mere diverſion and amuſement! But, if he had a ſufficient end for <hi>creating</hi> there certainly muſt be a ſufficient reaſon, for his exerciſing a conſtant <hi>gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment</hi> over the created univerſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:036380_0028_1008F6E5F75C1E80"/>THAT there is ſo much <hi>apparent</hi> evil—ſo much <hi>ſeeming</hi> confuſion—ſo many <hi>jarring</hi> and <hi>myſterious</hi> events extant in the world, has ſometimes been conſidered, as a forcible objection to the ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that God is at the HEAD of all things, and exerciſes a univerſal government.—But it ought to be conſidered, that ſhort-ſighted men, who are full of <hi>ſinful biaſſes</hi> and <hi>prepoſſeſſions,</hi> are very miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable judges, as to the events which are neceſſary to take place; ſo as to ſecure the welfare of a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which is as <hi>extenſive</hi> as the <hi>univerſe,</hi> and as <hi>durable</hi> as <hi>eternity</hi> itſelf. The little concerns and exigencies of an earthly kingdom, or a petty ſtate, yea of a family or an individual, often confound the wiſdom of men. The moſt dark and myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous events are often found to be pregnant with the higheſt good. The little occurrence of Joſeph's brethren ſelling him into Egypt, was a dark and gloomy event, and foreboded great evil, in the view of Jacob; yet, eventually, it proved to be of the utmoſt importance.</p>
            <p>BUT, whatever the ignorance, pride or vanity of man may ſuggeſt, the ſacred ſcriptures do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us, that God does reign, and is particularly concerned in the production of all events—that cold and heat—ſummer and winter, rain and drought, feed-time and harveſt—health and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—war and peace—good and evil; yea, all the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:036380_0029_1008F6EBDCDFFF90"/>affairs of the natural and moral world, are under the government and control of God—that he raiſes up empires and pulls them down—creates kings and magiſtrates and depoſes them, according to his ſovereign pleaſure.</p>
            <p>WE are taught very particularly, in the ſacred ſcriptures, as appears from what has been ſaid, that God diſpoſes of nations and arranges all events, with a view to one object; and that is, The eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment of a kingdom of righteouſneſs; and that he will continue to do ſo, till that kingdom ſhall be eſtabliſhed and rendered triumphant. Then his purpoſes will be anſwered—the drama will be fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed, and God will be all in all.</p>
            <p>IT now only remains, to point out the uſe and improvement that may be made of the ſubject: which we have conſidered, in a few particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences and remarks.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As the kingdom is the LORD's, and He is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted as HEAD above all, obligations to obedience and ſubjection to God, muſt be univerſal.</p>
            <p>IT muſt be the incumbent duty, not only of thoſe, who are ranked in the loweſt claſs of men, and are buſied in the moſt humble employments, to yield a univerſal obedience to the will of God; but
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:036380_0030_1008F6ED675C4758"/>obligations of the ſame nature, are incumbent on thoſe, who are exalted to places of the higheſt dignity and honor among men. They are equally under the government of God, and their obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to reverence and obey him, are, in kind, the ſame. Yea, the obligations on thoſe, who are in the higher walks of life are, in ſome reſpects, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly enhanced. Their example will have a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar influence, on the conduct and morals of thoſe, who are in more humble ſtations. Hence that demand of the prophet, "O heads <hi>of Jacob, and ye</hi> princes <hi>of the houſe of Iſrael; Is it not for</hi> you <hi>to know JUDGMENT.</hi>" Hence, alſo, that direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the pſalmiſt, "<hi>Be wiſe now, therefore,</hi> O ye kings, <hi>be inſtructed,</hi> O ye judges <hi>of the earth</hi>; ſerve the Lord with fear and rejoice with <hi>trembling. Kiſs the ſon leſt he be angry and ye periſh from the way.</hi>"</p>
            <p n="2">2. Is the kingdom the Lord's, and is He "ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted as Head above all, We ſee, that we have a ſtable and unfailing ſource of comfort, in the moſt dark and gloomy times, and amidſt the changes and revolutions which take place, in the rotation of events, reſpecting the preſent world.</p>
            <p>IF clouds and darkneſs ſurround our nation—if foreign powers threaten us from without—if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions and civil diſſentions do exiſt within—if
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:036380_0031_1008F6EFCC7C6940"/>vice, immorality and the moſt outrageous wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs do prevail, far and wide in the earth; yet the conſideration, that the kingdom is the LORD's, and that He is exalted as HEAD above all, affords the moſt ample ſupport, and lays a foundation for the moſt ſubſtantial peace. God is both able and fully determined, to eſtabliſh his kingdom.</p>
            <p>WE live in a day of mighty revolutions. Great events are rolling on in quick ſucceſſion, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage ſome great and intereſting changes in the ſtate of this world. The prophet Jeremiah demands, in the language of ſurpriſe, "Hath a nation changed their Gods, which are yet no Gods!" as if it were an unheard of affair, that a nation had laid aſide its falſe Gods. But we live in a day, when a powerful nation, which had ranked itſelf among thoſe, who acknowledge the true and living God, has abſolutely rejected and diſowned Him, and even proceeded to aboliſh the ordinances of heaven! "The myſtery of iniquity," as the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle expreſſes it, "doth already work." A deep concerted plan to ſpread infidelity far and wide—to ſubvert religion and undermine government—to give to the luſts and paſſions of men full ſcope, has been propagated among the nations of Europe, with ſurpriſing ſucceſs. Its bitter conſequences and baneful influence have already produced, "diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of nations, with perplexity," and even
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:036380_0032_1008F6F1945F4178"/>threaten to ſhake all Europe, to its very center. The effects of it have not been limited to Europe, Aſia and Africa feel its bitter conſequences. And even in America, the leaven has begun to ferment, and is, moſt probably, the <hi>ſource</hi> of the oppoſition which has been, to the adminiſtration of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional government—but we have a ſubſtantial and unfailing ſource of conſolation, under all thoſe gloomy appearances—the kingdom is the Lord's.</p>
            <p>INDEED, were we to have our views directed by the prophetic declarations, contained in the ſacred ſcriptures, we ſhould be led to expect, inſtead of being ſurpriſed to ſee ſuch events. Amidſt the confuſion, and infidelity of the preſent day, we ſee, that the man of ſin is in a meaſure deſtroyed; and that the papal hierarchy is crumbling into pieces. Nor are we to expect that the ſcenes of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, which are now experienced in Europe, will terminate, till ſomething ſtill more important is produced. The clouds appear to be gathering and preparations are making, for ſcenes far more extenſively diſtreſſing, than thoſe which have been, as yet, realized.—But God reigns—the kingdom is his. He will take care of it. Neither earth nor hell can prevail againſt Him—the wrath of man ſhall praiſe him, the remainder of wrath will he reſtrain.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:036380_0033_1008F6F4AF112608"/>3. FROM the obſervations which have been made, we are led to ſee the important nature of the inſtitution of civil government.</p>
            <p>THE kingdom is the Lord's; and all the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which God has made, as well as all the events which take place, have a reference to the eſtabliſhment of a kingdom of righteouſneſs?—are deſigned, by God, as means of accompliſhing and perfecting ſo important a purpoſe. I do not ſay, that this is the object which mankind have had in view, in forming civil conſtitutions and qualifying governments. Nothing, perhaps, has been further out of view. They have, probably, for the moſt part been dictated by worldly views and motives. But God has inſtituted it, as one mean and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, to advance the progreſs of a ſpiritual king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. This gives the inſtitution of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, an aſpect of great conſequence. It teaches us, that it was not contrived, merely to exalt ſome men over the heads of others; or to ſecure to the members of ſociety, an equal enjoyment of privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of a worldly nature; or, merely, to protect life and property; but it has a further reach and more important deſign. It is nothing leſs, than one of the expedients which the Supreme Governor of the world has adopted, to forward the great and important purpoſes of eſtabliſhing a ſpiritual king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Viewed in any other point of light, it dwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:036380_0034_1008F6F7F2696158"/>into nothing, in point of conſequence and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.</p>
            <p>I AM not inſenſible, that writers on civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, have generally conſidered it, as a mean to ſecure the peace and welfare of ſociety in this world; and as having no concern with or reference to a ſpiritual kingdom. But can it be ſo, that in the inſtitution of civil government, which has ſuch prodigious influence on the ſtate of this world, the Supreme Being has forgotten the great object he has in view in his government! Muſt civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be conſidered, as a ſolitary exception, as to its deſign, from all the works and other inſtitutions of God! Can we ſuppoſe, that God would build up and pull down kingdoms, on account of their influence and tendency, to build up or obſtruct the progreſs of religion, and the eſtabliſhment of a kingdom of righteouſneſs, if civil government were not deſigned as a mean to advance and promote them?</p>
            <p>WERE it not for the treaty of peace which God is now carrying on, through Jeſus Chriſt, civil government and earthly kingdoms would be utterly aboliſhed: and the whole material world would be deſtroyed. The advancement and progreſs of that treaty, is the end of all God's adminiſtrations. Hence we find, that when civil government is right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:036380_0035_1008F6F9819695F0"/>applied and adminiſtered, kings will be nurſing fathers and their queens will be nurſing mothers to the Church of God. In this view of the deſign of civil government, it appears to be an inſtitution of great conſequence.</p>
            <p n="4">4. WE are naturally to conclude, from what has been ſaid, that ſuch men as have <hi>fixed moral</hi> and <hi>religious principles,</hi> are the only characters which can, with any propriety, be elected into offices of truſt, to direct the affairs and concerns of civil government.</p>
            <p>THIS inference is fairly deducible, from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of civil government. If civil government be deſigned, as an hand-maid to religion—as a mean to advance and forward a kingdom of righteouſneſs, it muſt be important, that thoſe, who are elected into civil office, and eſpecially into the principal offices of government, ſhould be <hi>friends</hi> to the cauſe; and ſo, men of <hi>fixed</hi> and <hi>eſtabliſhed moral</hi> and <hi>religious principles.</hi> Yea, may we not proceed ſo far as to ſay, that they ſhould be firm believers in chriſtianity? For the kingdom which God is raiſing up among men, is founded on the <hi>chriſtian ſyſtem</hi>; and is to be advanced, under the reign of Jeſus Chriſt, as mediatorial king. That ſuch char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters alone are to be ſought and elected into pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of truſt, in a civil government, is not only
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:036380_0036_1008F6FBC870DF98"/>dictated by the deſign of the inſtitution; but is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined by God. "Thou ſhalt provide out of all the people, able men, ſuch as fear God, men of truth, hating covetouſneſs," &amp;c. men of no other deſcription are friendly, to the real end of civil government.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>liberalizing</hi> ſpirit of the preſent day (which looks with <hi>indifferency</hi> and <hi>patience,</hi> on every thing, excepting ſtrict religion and fervent piety,) I am aware, inculcates a different doctrine. Such as are under its influence will tell us, that moral and religious principles are of no importance; yea, it is a diſcovery made by the modern <hi>Illuminati,</hi> that both religion and government are enemies to the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mankind. Hence it is, that extenſive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations have been formed, and unwearied efforts made, to overturn religious and moral ſyſtems, as well as to unhinge and ſubvert civil conſtitutions and governments. But, it happens fortunately, that what may be expected, from a government adminiſtered by men, who are void of <hi>moral princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> and are plunged deep into <hi>infidelity,</hi> has been ſo openly exemplified. When moral feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and religious reſtraints are eradicated, and God is not acknowledged and reverenced, the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers againſt the moſt atrocious wickedneſs are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and the luſts of the human heart will be unreſtrained. With men of ſuch a character at
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:036380_0037_1008F6FE1542EEA0"/>the head of government, we could hardly expect any thing elſe, than that the rights of men ſhould be trampled on—the laws of humanity be ſported with, and an ambition prevail, which knows no bounds.—All this we ſee exemplified in Europe, at the preſent time. No more ſtriking picture can be given, of the baleful influence and effects of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, when dictating the meaſures of government, than are exhibited in the riſe and progreſs of the revolution in France. When we review the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous meaſures which have been adopted—what riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of blood have been ſpilt—with what coolneſs and deliberation the lives of the old, the young and the innocent babe have been deſpoiled—the prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty of ſubjects ſeized—the boundleſs ambition and inſatiable thirſt for domination which has prevailed —the piracies which have been committed on the ſeas—and the inſidious and wicked policy which has been practiſed, reſpecting other nations; or to ſum up the whole in a word, when we behold a nation, once famous for its civility and poliſhed manners, changed into a nation of barbarians; I ſay, when we ſee theſe things actually exiſting, and can be accounted for in no way, unleſs from the influence of <hi>infidelity,</hi> Can we need any thing further, to teach us the importance of placing men of <hi>fixed moral</hi> and <hi>religious ſentiments,</hi> at the head of government? The Supreme Governor of the world, has deſignedly given the nations of the
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:036380_0038_1008F7017606FE60"/>earth, a ſtriking picture and example of the bane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful influence and ruining tendency of infidelity. And, no nation which, after this ſolemn warning and admonition, ſhall act the ſame part, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the management of the concerns of ſociety, into the hands of <hi>infidels,</hi> or of men whoſe <hi>feelings</hi> are <hi>looſe</hi> and <hi>unhinged,</hi> reſpecting religion and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, can expect leſs, than to ſhare, in a higher or lower degree, in the ſame plagues.</p>
            <p>THERE can hardly be a greater inconſiſtency, than for a chriſtian people, to appoint ſuch men, as the guardians of their rights, and as nurſes to the Church of God, who have not fixed moral and religious principles; and, who are nearly afloat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting chriſtianity in every view of it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. THE ſubject, which we have been conſidering and illuſtrating, is of uſe, and may be particularly improved, by civil rulers and legiſlators.</p>
            <p>ALTHOUGH they are placed at the head of gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, and have authority to enact laws, to reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulate the community over which they are placed; yet, they are to conſider, that there is a higher power, which preſides over and controls the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of men. The kingdom is the LORD's, and He is exalted as HEAD above ALL. Civil rulers and legiſlators are but <hi>ſervants</hi> or <hi>miniſters</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:036380_0039_1008F70305AD6A38"/>Their work is aſſigned them by Him. They are ſervants, raiſed up by God, to forward the great object of his government, in forming and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a kingdom of righteouſneſs. At the ſame time therefore, they are framing laws, for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the lives and properties of their conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, and for the equal adminiſtration of juſtice, they are not only to be cautious, that they do <hi>no harm</hi> to religion and the Church of God, but to be careful to do every thing, in their power, to countenance and ſupport them.</p>
            <p>IT is not pretended, that civil rulers and legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors have a right, abſolutely and authoritatively to impoſe <hi>creeds</hi> and <hi>confeſſions of faith</hi>; yet, moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, it muſt be incumbent on them, in all the meaſures they adopt, to manifeſt a governing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for God and the intereſts of his kingdom. It muſt be their indiſpenſible duty, to adopt ſuch meaſures, as will, moſt directly, encourage and promote, the progreſs of that treaty of peace and reconciliation, which God is carrying on with men.</p>
            <p>IT is in the power of civil rulers, in many reſpects, to prepare the way, for an advantageous tender of ſalvation to mankind. They may ſet up their ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners againſt vice—encourage men of religion and virtue, and ſupport the inſtitutions of Chriſtianity.—
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:036380_0040_1008F705CDC4F6A0"/>Many of the ſubordinate officers of government are appointed, by the legiſlature. If men of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, who are profeſſed friends to the chriſtian ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, as well as of good government, were diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed as objects of particular favor; and if, on the contrary, the profane—the deſpiſers of religion and fervent piety, and thoſe who neglect religious inſtitutions were rejected, it would, certainly, be a worthy teſtimony of regard to the kingdom of God; and an encouragement to men to do well.</p>
            <p>DISSOLUTENESS of manners, if not a contempt of chriſtianity has been, within a few years, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increaſing. It would be very unhappy, indeed, if thoſe, who are diſtinguiſhed as rulers and legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators, ſhould be wanting, in their exertions, to ſtem their progreſs; but above all ſo; if they, by their example, ſhould countenance them.—The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of rulers is great and extenſive; although they are often the objects, at which the ſhafts of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and malice are levelled. Their ſtation reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting religion and virtue cannot be neutral. Their tranſactions and examples will, neceſſarily, have an extenſive influence.</p>
            <p>THE people, in this ſtate, have reaſon to be very thankful that the Supreme Ruler of the world has given them ſuch a ſucceſſion of rulers,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:036380_0041_1008F70810863D68"/>as have, not only been firm friends to their civil rights, but have been diſpoſed to encourage the cauſe of religion and virtue.—And it is no ſmall occaſion of joy to the friends of Zion, that the late legislature of this ſtate, while the zealous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates for religion, in England and Scotland, have provided miſſionaries, to ſound the glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of ſalvation in Africa, in the Eaſt-Indies and in the iſlands of the Pacific ocean, have adopted meaſures, to make proviſion, for the preaching of the goſpel among the new ſettlements, in this country; and, if poſſible, to chriſtianize the heathen nations.</p>
            <p>AS the kingdom is the Lord's, we may aſſure ourſelves, that he will take care of it; whether earthly powers nouriſh and cheriſh, or neglect and abandon it. It will certainly flouriſh and finally triumph. Yet, let it be remembered, that thoſe who are raiſed to places of truſt and influence, as well as thoſe in private life, muſt, finally, give up a moſt ſolemn account to HIM, who is exalted as HEAD above all.</p>
            <p n="6">6. THE ſubject which we have had under conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration, may be improved, to <hi>animate</hi> and <hi>encourage</hi> the miniſters of the goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:036380_0042_1008F70B6A58F528"/>THE miniſters of Chriſt are officers in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Lord; and their direct buſineſs is, to be "workers together with him." They are ſent out, purpoſely, to explain the nature of God's kingdom—to plead its cauſe among men, and to perſuade them to inliſt as ſubjects in it. The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of this world are to be managed by other hands. Miniſters are, by office, to exert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in endeavouring to build up and eſtabliſh a ſpiritual kingdom. And, ſince God is at the head of it, what encouragements have miniſters to be zealous and active? Did ſucceſs depend, merely on their ſtrength and efforts; and had they not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to expect the interpoſition of no higher power, they might well be diſcouraged. But the kingdom is the LORD's. He will ſucceed and proſper its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement. He is, at this time, moſt evidently diſpoſing of the affairs of earthly kingdoms, ſo as to prepare the way for the eſtabliſhment of his own kingdom. He has given the moſt abſolute aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in his word, that all the evils which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant—the diſtreſs and revolution of nations, ſhall conſpire to advance a kingdom of righteouſneſs; however gloomy it may appear to ſhort-ſighted men—that one event ſhall roll on after another, till all God's deſigns are accompliſhed. However weak and depreſſed this kingdom may now appear, the time is coming, and probably is not far diſtant,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:036380_0043_1008F70CF90050D0"/>when "it ſhall break in pieces and conſume all" other "kingdoms and it ſhall ſtand forever."</p>
            <p>THERE is, therefore, from the nature and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the kingdom; and, eſpecially from the determinations and power of Him, whoſe is the kingdom, the moſt-abundant encouragement, for the miniſters of Chriſt to be active and zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Besides, their only encouragement of ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the triumphs and glory, which await the kingdom of God, does ariſe from their being "faithful unto death."<note n="*" place="bottom">Since the laſt anniverſary election, there has been but two inſtances of mortality, among the paſtors of the Churches in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut; viz.
